            "answer_text": "First, it\u2019s Baton Rouge, not Barton Rouge. Not much changed there. Other than the student population of LSU, it has always been a smorgasbord of neighborhoods, usually overshadowed by racist megachurches and Baptist bible thumpers. In general, New Orleans has had a majority of African American residents, at least over the past 30\u201340 years. Hurricane Katrina exposed the weakness of the mostly WHITE Army Corps of Fracking Engineers, who thoroughly under-engineered the supports for the levee system on the 17th Street canal, which was undermined by surging lake water. Despite their error, the Army Corps tried to claim that this levee was overtopped, but it was clear from the photos of the debris line (3 ft. below the top of the levee further down the canal) that this was a despicable lie to cover their negligence. Further, the Corps\u2019 construction of MRGO (Mississippi River Gulf Outlet) destroyed the entire eastern side of New Orleans / Chalmette / Marrero (St. Bernard Parish) because it allowed storm waters to be pushed directly into those areas from the Gulf, The storm surge overtopped MRGO\u2019s levees and washed numerous homes off of their foundations. Am I bitter? Yes. I lost the value of my childhood home due to their negligence, and many more people lost their lives, not during the storm but in the criminal incompetence that followed the flooding. The negligence of the W administration and FEMA\u2019s \u2018Brownie\u2019 not only delayed the delivery of food and water to the survivors, but exacerbated the cleanup and recovery, complete with formaldehyde filled trailers for the storm\u2019s refugees and mountains of refuse that sat for months around neighborhoods after the storm. Those who could move elsewhere after this debacle left for places like Houston, which was pummeled by Hurrican Harvey several years later. They left largely because they didn\u2019t trust the Army Corps to do a proper job of fixing the levees. Those who couldn\u2019t afford to move stayed. In spite of the government neglect, New Orleans has managed to reimagine itself with the majority of its wonderful remaining population. Look closely at the progress they have made despite the odds before you judge a place by the color of their population. ",

But I\u2019m sure New Orleans is declining as an aftermath to hurricane Katrina. It will never be the same again. I visited the city 6 months after the storm and I couldn\u2019t believe the destruction. Especially in the lower 9th Ward. Unbelievable destruction. ",
