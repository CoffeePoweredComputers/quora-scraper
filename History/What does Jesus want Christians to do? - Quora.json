            "answer_text": "What does Jesus want Christians to do? The early Christians who followed the teachings of Jesus were true Christians. They did not know anything about the teachings of Paul regarding the Atonement, Original Sin, Salvation by grace without obedience to God\u2019s law, sin inheritance, or rapture. They did not worship Jesus as God because the concept of trinity was not yet defined by the church fathers in the fourth century.   Most churches do not teach the true teachings like Matthew 10:8 \u2018Freely you have received; freely give\u2019; they teach that it is o.k. to reap the financial gifts in exchange of the spiritual gifts and preach the attractive teachings like: \u2018And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified\u2019 Romans 8:30 They try to make people feel happy with such attractive teachings in order to receive more donations. \u201cIf we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?\u201d 1 Corinthians 9:11. Most churches do not follow the strict teachings which urge us to obey God as taught by Jesus in Matthew 22:35-40, Luke 10:25-28, Mark 12:28-34, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like \u2018We are saved by grace through faith apart from works\u2019 - Ephesians 2:8-9 \u2018Even when we were dead in sins, we are saved by grace\u2019 - Ephesians 2:5 \u2018A man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law\u2019 - Romans 3:28 \u2018A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith\u2019 - Galatians 2:16 \u2018For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse\u2019 - Galatians 3:10 Most churches do not follow the strict teachings like If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away which is taught by Jesus in Matthew 18:9, Matthew 5:29 and Mark 9:47, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like: \u2018God has chosen us before the foundations of the world\u2019 - Ephesians 1:4 \u2018God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation\u2019 - 2 Thessalonians 2:13 \u2018For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation\u2019 - 1 Thessalonians 5:9 \u2018But let me reveal to you a wonderful secret. We will not all die, but we will all be transformed!\u2019 1 Corinthians 15:51 \u2018God has saved us and called us\u2019 - 2 Timothy 1:9 \u2018We have been justified through faith\u2019 - Romans 5:1, Romans 5:9 Most churches believe that Jesus\u2019 death was necessary for the forgiveness of sins. But Jesus, like all other prophets, taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. No human sacrifice is necessary for salvation. No human bloodshed is necessary for salvation. No savior should die for the salvation of others; everyone is responsible for his own salvation. Jesus has also confirmed the same in Matthew 18:21-35, 6:14-15, Mark 11:25-26, Luke 6:35-38, Matthew 19:16\u201319, Matthew 21:43, and Matthew 25:41\u201346 When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of atonement, they have added verses like Matthew 18:11 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost The bible footnotes explain that verse Matthew 18:11 was not in the original old scriptures Hebrews 9:22 \u201cwithout the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\u201d is a misunderstanding of verse Leviticus 17:10-14 which is not about atonement but is about dietary laws. God has clarified that blood in meat is not good for health; that clarification was necessary to the people who did not have advanced medical tools to know that eating the meat with the blood still in it is bad for health The true word of God is not what is written by the unknown writer of Hebrews; it is what has been taught by Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah, Jesus and the Prophets who taught the forgiveness is possible by obedience, repentance, and prayers Proverbs 16:6 teaches that \u201cIn mercy and truth atonement is provided for iniquity.\u201d Psalm 69:30-31 teaches that praise worship is better than sacrifice 2 Chronicles 7:14 teaches that forgiveness is obtainable without a blood sacrifice \u2018If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin\u2019 Jonah 3 teaches that people are forgiven when they repented and fasted, without offering any sacrifice and without shedding any blood Proverbs 17:15 states: \u2018He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous, both of them alike are an abomination unto God\u2019 That should be considered as a warning to the teachers who promise free salvation to the sinners and who teach that the innocent has been punished on behalf of the sinners Jesus taught the parable of The Prodigal Son in Luke 15:11-32 to highlight the importance of obedience and repentance as the main prerequisites for salvation That is the core Christianity teaching as taught in Matthew 7:21 Not every one that said to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven Jesus has confirmed the teachings of the Old Testimony \u2018in repentance and obedience is your salvation\u2019 as taught in Isaiah 30:15 In Matthew 25:31-45 Jesus described the final judgment as being based on good works; he clarified that those who obey the law will be saved Salvation is not based solely on belief and nothing else; salvation is not granted to those who merely profess acceptance of Jesus without performing kind or compassionate deeds In Luke 13:3 and 13:5, Jesus taught that repentance is necessary for salvation But unless you repent, you too will all perish Mark 12:33 teaches: And to love one\u2019s neighbor as himself, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices What Jesus taught here is not different from the wisdom taught by the old testimony Hosea 6:6 \u2018For I desire mercy and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings\u2019 That verse teaches us that forgiveness is possible by repentance and obedience; no sacrifice is necessary Matthew 9:13 teaches that Jesus came to call the sinner to repentance \u2018I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance\u2019 The wrong teachings about original sin, atonement, and salvation by grace without obedience to God\u2019s law were taught by Paul who was not educated by Jesus.

            "answer_text": "He wants us to know who we are \u201cIn Christ\u201d. When you realize you are a sinner that cannot pay for your sins and you need a savior who died for those sins on your behalf, you can reconcile yourself to God in that He will save you from eternal separation from Him. When you trust that He died for your sins, was buried and rose from the grave to save you, you are sealed with the Holy Spirit. (1 Corinthians 15:1\u20134 KJB). Understanding the distinctiveness of the Pauline revelation (Romans-Philemon) clears up so much confusion. We are to be stablished according to Paul's gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the Mystery. Rom. 16:25. That the Gentiles would be saved was not part of the mystery Jesus gave to Paul but that the Gentiles would be saved APART from the prophetic program was. God interrupted the prophetic timeline when Israel rejected the last call and the last offer of the Kingdom in Acts 7. God saved the chief of sinners and gave him the new marching orders. Jesus told Paul all that the cross accomplished and that there is now no difference between the Jew and the Gentile. All come the same way. By faith ALONE in the finished work of Christ. This the the thing.... The body of Christ , the one new man, the new creation was not revealed until God gave it to Paul. So you wont find it in the OT. You wont find it in Mathew~John. For it was a secret. It was hid in God, it was not made known. Eph. 3:9 . Romans 16:25, Col. 1:25~26, I Cor. 2:6~8. If one denies this then they are denying the simple truth of the scripture and they will be tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine. They will be putting the body of Christ in Matthew 24 for example. We are NOT there. That is instruction for Israel. Also the entire book of Revelation is for Israel. The body of Christ is not there. John agreed to keep his ministry to the circumcision and that is just what he did, along with Peter and James. Gal. 2:7~9. It is either true or it isn't. You either believe the words on the page or you don't. Paul says \"behold I show you a mystery.\" 1 Cor. 15:51 , 1 Thess. 4:13~18 A part of the mystery is our blessed hope which is the catching away of the body of Christ before prophetic program is taken off hold and the 70th week of Daniel begins. We are to comfort one another with this truth. The 70th week of Daniel is when the offer of salvation by grace thru faith ALONE is off the table, for the dispensation of grace will be ended in an instant. Does this mean we will not suffer persecution? No. For all who live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer for that truth. But we as members of Gods Body will not go thru the 70th week of Daniel. It is a time of Jacobs (Israels) ..not ours. Praise God for his provision for us. He will give us the grace to go through what ever befalls us as we await our Blessed Hope. ",
