            "answer_text": "Yes, there were Black ancient Egyptians. There is nothing wrong with Blacks saying that ancient Egypt started with black Africans. When ppl say the black kings did not exist first in Egypt, that is like saying the Indian wasn't in America...u rarely see a 100% native Indian in America now, but the fact remains they were. Now-a- days, some modern Egyptians only want to trace their ancestry back to the Arabs or Copts. The Arabs and Copts were never indigenous tribes of Africa back in 3500 BC. Historians state that the Kingdom of Egypt began around this time span. Copts is the Arabic word for the Greek Agyptos. By it being Arabic that means it is not ancient enough to have even existed in 3500 BC. Sit down and think about this logical question\u2026 how is it possible, that the Arabs will leave their own land and migrate to Africa and build all those Triangular Pyramids we see today in Egypt and Nubia? Ziggurats that are found in ancient Mesopotamia are not Triangular Pyramids but square shape temples. http://www.differencebetween.net/miscellaneous/difference-between-ziggurats-and-pyramids/ The megalithic structures that served as the origin of the astronomical antecedents of the Pyramids began in Nubia, Nabta Playa around 9000 BC. There are no Triangular Pyramids in any Arab countries except Egypt where the Arab\u2019s conquered in 600 AD. The Arabs migrated to Africa. They did not build ANY TYPE OF PYRAMIDS, (step or triangular) BEFORE THE EGYPTIANS.  Egypt experienced many conquests, colorizations and mass immigration across all of its extended history. Its complexion and ethnicity changed because of this. There were black and white Pharaohs during different time spans. That is why it is so important to post dates. The Pharaohs married many Foreign Princesses to bind treaties and had many Bi-racial kids. However, before 1640 BC, Ancient Egypt started first with black Africans who were indigenous tribes to the Nile Valley located in Africa\u2026then Egypt became multicultural...it\u2019s not rocket science; The Black Kings existed from the start. Considering the number of foreign slaves that Egypt had captured from wars, the pharaohs marrying foreign princesses to bind treaties, plus being a major trading center since the 3rd Dynasty\u2026One has to be reminded of the fact that ancient Egypt was NOT a racially and ethnically homogeneous society even if Africans made up the bulk of the population before 1640 BC. You will find tombs and statues of all races in Egypt.The Black Kings existed from the start. When you speak of Egypt you must specify what period of time you are talking about. Are you talking about the Old Kingdom, the Middle kingdom, or the New Kingdom. Why? Because ownership of this land has been passed around from various empires like a football during a Super bowl game. For instance, Key points are:(Excerpts from Modern Humans Came Out of Africa, \"Definitive\" Study Says 1. Modern humans (Homo sapiens) have a single origin in Africa. Africa is the mother of all races. Tribes of people started to migrate to different parts of the earth. (Tower of Babylon in the Bible) The farther away people lived from Africa, the lighter they became due to genetic mutation. The tribes always settled near rivers of water. Some African tribes settled along the whole length of the Nile. These tribes grew and became settlements. The settlements grew and became villages. The villages grew and became towns, then cities, and then kingdoms. 2. Egypt is in Africa. Egypt (Greek name) is at the top of Africa by the Sudan. Its ancient name was Kermit or Kemet meaning black soil. The Africans were Kings there first before the foreign invaders. Then you have invasions from foreigners such as: the Hyksos 1640 BC - 1532 BC, Assyrians invaded around 671 BC, the Persians 525 BC, the Greeks in 332 BC, the Romans invaded in 30 BC to make Egypt part of the Roman Empire, then the Arabs came around 600 AD. 3. The Hebrew and Christian Bible is a great source to learn about Egypt. Noah had three sons, Shem, Japhet, and Ham. Ham, Shem and Japheth, Sons of Noah -- Courtesy of Return To Glory Even back in Biblical times, the descendants of the 3 sons of Noah, intermingled with each other. Plus, the Kings and Pharaohs would have many wives and concubines. Some of the wives would come from foreign royalty in foreign lands, to bind treaties of the powerful nations at that time. Example: 1 Kings 1\u20134 states: The Hebrew and Christian Bible tells us that the Jewish King Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines. The wives were described as foreign princesses, including Pharaoh's daughter and women of Moab, Ammon, Edom, Sidon and of the Hittites. In the Quran, Solomon is considered a major prophet, and Muslims generally refer to him by the Arabic variant Sulayman, son of David. Race was not much of a factor, but class or status was important. The Egyptians also elevated some human beings to gods. Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form. So, there was much race mixing even in biblical times. Egypt was a major trading center. Ordinary people also mingled together. Also, since the Middle Kingdom, foreign slaves mainly from Asia, became increasingly numerous. They were either prisoners of war or traded by slave merchants. See Slavery, its causes and practice Therefore, you begin to see many shades of Colored People from the darkest eggplant hue to honey-colored caramel, to brownish- tan, to reddish brown (ruddy colored), etc. For example: Pharaoh Amenhotep III is known to have married several foreign princesses as part of treaties which balanced power between nations. Notice how many foreign princess he had. This is a good indicator of a Nation\u2019s power. During this time frame, Egypt was a major force to be reckon with. Egypt did not give too many of their princesses away. Amenhotep III: Biography, Family & Death | Study.com: Biography, Sons & Family Tree | Study.com Amenhotep III \u2022 Gilukhepa, the daughter of Shuttarna II of Mitanni, in the tenth year of his reign. \u2022 Tadukhepa, the daughter of his ally Tushratta of Mitanni, Around Year 36 of his reign \u2022 A daughter of Kurigalzu, king of Babylon. \u2022 A daughter of Kadashman-Enlil, king of Babylon. \u2022 A daughter of Tarhundaradu, ruler of Arzawa. \u2022 A daughter of the ruler of Ammia (in modern Syria). In the Bible we read of King Solomon getting a princess. WHY? His marriage to Pharaoh's daughter appears to have cemented a political alliance with Egypt. The Egyptians had heard of King David and his conquests. Egypt had already lost a war in Canaan by Joshua. Joshua was one of the twelve spies of Israel sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. In Numbers 13:1\u201316, and after the death of Moses, he led the Israelite tribes in the conquest of Canaan and allocated the land to the tribes. ... Joshua also holds a position of respect among Muslims. So, Egypt knew Israel was a mighty nation to be feared. 3 A. When trying to understand Biblical stories we must look at the Hebrew meaning of a word since our Christian Bible is based on Hebrew roots. We can look at different Bible tools for clarification. They tells us, that the word Ham meaning hot and black. This is supported by the evidence of Hebrew and Arabic, in which the word chamam means \"to be hot\" and \"to be black,\" the latter signification being derived from the former. Khawm is the native name of Ham. The Greek word for Egypt is Aegyptos. The native name for Egypt is KMT. kmt, and km was the etymological root of other words, such as Kam or Ham, which refer to Black people in Hebrew tradition. http://biblehub.com/topical/h/ham.htm. https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionary/ham/ http://www.abarim-publications.com/Meaning/Ham.html#.Wyl3BadKjIU Ham (Hebrew meaning hot, burnt, black) was part of the family of eight who survived the great flood. Descendants of Ham populated Africa and parts of Asia. The word Ham is believed to come from the word Khawm which means \u201cblack, hot, and burnt\u201d in Hebrew. Ham had 4 sons. They make up the AFRO-ASIATIC FAMILY. The Bible stated that Ham and his sons, and their soon-to-be descendants lived and became the forefathers of the modern African continent, the modern Middle East, and the modern West Asia. A. Cush \u2013 Nubians/ Ethiopians and early Babylonians. Ethiopia's borders at one time, stretched beyond the Red Sea, all the way to modern Yemen. The Tribe of Cush was a rolling stone. Ethiopia, the land of Cush, was closer, both to India and Israel in ancient times before its borders were shrunken. Apparently, this family divided into different branches early. Some founded Mesopotamia/ Babylon (notably, King Nimrod) and others founded Ethiopia. Nimrod's kingdom included the cities of Babel, Erech, Akkad, and Calneh, in Shinar (Gen 10:10) B. Mizraim\u2013 Egyptians. Misr is the Hebrew and Aramaic name for Egypt C. Phut \u2013 Sometimes called PUT or PUNT. The Land of Punt, also called Pwenet or Pwene by the ancient Egyptians. Punt was an ancient kingdom \u2013 founder of Lydia and modern day Somalia- Somalians D. Canaan \u2013 All the Ites people in the Bible who descended from Canaan. Canaanites are believed to be the first people in Israel. These brothers would come together and fight with Egypt against the western invaders in the Old and Middle Kingdoms. Later on in history , during the New Kingdom, they would have civil wars among the tribes.  Beside the Cush (Ethiopia) in Africa, the Bible definitely speaks of Cushites in Asia. Cush was the father of the biblical Nimrod mentioned in the \"Table of Nations\" in Genesis 10:6 and I Chronicles 1:8. Look at this map showing the Table of nations. See Cush is mentioned twice. https://www.bible-history.com/maps/2- Before the construction of the Suez Canal, the entire eastern coast of the Mediterranean was a single land mass, adjoining Africa. Canaan was East Africa, later known in modern times as Palestine and Israel. These brothers would come together and fight with Egypt against the western invaders. Later on in history they would have civil wars among the tribes. 4. Let us look at the Christian and Hebrew texts, to understand the story of Egypt. According to Jubilees 10:29\u201334, Canaan'steadfast refusal to join his elder brothers in Ham's allotment beyond the Nile, and instead \"squatting\" within the inheritance of Shem, on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean, the region later promised to Abraham: And Canaan saw the land of Lebanon to the river of Egypt, that it was very good, and he went not into the land of his inheritance to the west (that is to) the sea, and he dwelt in the land of Lebanon, eastward and westward from the border of Jordan and from the border of the sea. And Ham, his father, and Cush ( Ethiopia) and Mizraim ( Egypt) his brothers said unto Canaan: 'Thou hast settled in a land which is not thine, and which did not fall to us by lot: do not do so; for if thou dost do so, thou and thy sons will fall in the land and (be) accursed through sedition; for by sedition ye have settled, and by sedition will thy children fall, and thou shalt be rooted out for ever. Dwell not in the dwelling of Shem; for to Shem and to his sons did it come by their lot. Cursed art thou, and cursed shalt thou be beyond all the sons of Noah, by the curse by which we bound ourselves by an oath in the presence of the holy judge, and in the presence of Noah our father.' But he did not hearken unto them, and dwelt in the land of Lebanon from Hamath to the entering of Egypt, he and his sons until this day. And for this reason that land is named Canaan. 5. The Bible said Egypt is the Land of Ham.( Hebrew meaning hot, black, and burnt). The Bible never mentions once the lands of either England or Germany. However, African nations are mentioned again and again. The Old Testament calls Egypt the Land of Ham. The Bible refers to Egypt as \"the land of Ham\" in Psalms.78:51; 105:23,27; 106:22; 1 Chronicles 4:40. It has over forty references to Ethiopia and over one hundred references to Egypt. Even ancient sources, biblical and non-biblical, mention both Ethiopia and Egypt together long before either country was on any map. Egypt's ancient name was Kermit or Kemet meaning black soil. It talks about the wars that involved the major superpowers since mankind started. These wars can be proven to be true from History books and archaeological finds. Psalm 105:23-27 (KJV) 23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies. 25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtly with his servants. 26 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen. 27 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. Psalm 106:20-22 20They exchanged their glorious God for an image of a bull, which eats grass. 21They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt, miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea. 6. Archaeology is an important science that CONFIRMS the historical accuracy of the Bible. Since the Bible refers to hundreds of cities, kings, and places, we would expect to find evidence from on-site excavations of statues, maps, and scrolls of ancient Egypt. The Bible gives great detail to the Assyrian/Babylonian wars with Egypt and Israel. You will find the wars between Egypt and the Assyrians, well documented in the Bible. 7. Let\u2019s take an example from the Bible of an Egyptian war and validate it. I am not asking you to believe the war stories just because they are in the Bible. Believe them because the stories of the wars have been proven to be true by the historical writings and archaeological digs, 8. The Bible has historical events, such as wars, that have been proven to be true: The Bible mentions the African King Tirhakah. the King of Cush who later became the Pharaoh of Egypt. Is this true? YES, this war has been proven by the writings of Assyrian King Esarhaddon. He had Pharaoh Tirhakah engraved on a stele in Sinjirli plus there exists some statues honoring this great Pharaoh that have been found. Victory stele of Esarhaddon - Wikipedia Tirhakah, Psammetichus I, Neco II, Psamtik II, Hophra, Apries Nebuchadnezzar Josiah, Jehoiakim, Zedekiah Melqart Stele of Ben-Hadad-Ezer II: 845 BC Tirhakah was the King of Ethiopia, or Cush, and of Egypt. Notice that he has two serpents on his headdress. This prince, at the head of a powerful army, attempted to relieve the Jewish King Hezekiah, when attacked by Assyrian King Sennarcherib. The Assyrian king invaded Judah twice, defeated Babylon, and rebuilt the city of Nineveh.. In 2 Kings 19:9 Isaiah 37:19, B. C. 712. Taharqa - Wikipedia  The stories have been proven through the artifacts of the Archaeological digs. The Bible talks about the Pharaohs of Egypt that played an important part in Jewish history. Pharaohs in the Bible - Wikipedia More proof that the wars mentioned in the Bible are true. 8 A. Let\u2019s find evidence of the black kings before the 25th Dynasty. Count Volney was a white scholar and Egyptologist of the 19th century. He said Egypt was started by black Africans. The Sphinx of Giza -- Its Nose, Lips, Gender, and Ethnicity -- www.SphinxOfGiza.com Egypt was originally a colony of Nubia (Kush or Cush) but eventually separated from Nubia and became independent and even stronger than them. In ancient times the border of southern (or \"Upper\") Egypt was much further south than where it is today. Upper Egypt in ancient times extended well into what is now the country of Sudan 8B. Once again we look at the wars mentioned in the Hebrew and Christian Bible. Then we validate the war through archaeological evidence and history books to PROVE IT IS TRUE! The Egyptologist Darrell Baker states that the 14th dynasty being of Canaanite origin. Canaan was the brother to Mizraim (Egypt) and to Cush( Ethiopia), and Put. These brothers helped each other fight the western invaders together. Amarna Tablets are a collection of 382 clay tablets written by the Canaanites to Pharaoh of Egypt, asking his brother for help....Help me Brother, oh great Egypt ......I need help. I am getting attacked!!!!the letters include requests for military help in the north against Hittite invaders, and in the south to fight against the Habiru (Hebrew). Yes, Canaan needed help in defending themselves from the invading Israelite's under Joshua. At the time of the Conquest of Canaan by Israel (Joshua) Egypt was nominally in control of the region. go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarna_letters#/media/File:Amarnamap.pngand go to: http://www.bible.ca/archeology/bible-archeology-maps-conquest-amarna-tablets-letters-akhenaten-habiru-abiru-hebrews-1404-1340bc.htm 9. The Egyptian brothers helped each other fight as describe in Jeremiah and other chapters - Jeremiah 46:9 Charge, you horses! Drive furiously, you charioteers! March on, you warriors-men of Cush and Put who carry shields, men of Lydia who draw the bow. (They march out of Egypt, arranged in their divisions; cavalry, chariots, and infantry to begin the campaign.) The forty-sixth chapter contains two prophecies concerning it: one is the discomfiture of Pharaoh Necho at Carchemish by Nebuchadnezzar and the long subsequent conquest of Egypt by the same king; also the preservation of the Jews ( Jeremiah 46:27 Jeremiah 46:28). Is this war that is mentioned in the Bible true. has it been validated in history books? Yes Battle of Carchemish - Wikipedia The Egyptians, employed mercenary soldiers from their brother\u2019s tribes.  Ethiopians\u2014Hebrew name is Cush:  Libyans--Phut, Mauritania, west of Egypt (compare Genesis 10:6 ). The Libyans used long shields extending to the feet. Lydians sometimes called Ludim ( Genesis 10:13 , 1 Chronicles 1:11 , Nahum 3:9 Isaiah 66:19 ; Jeremiah 46:9 ; Ezekiel 27:10 ; Ezekiel 30:5 and 38:5) Ludim - an African nation descended from Egypt (Mizraim);Mizraite people or tribe descended from Ludim the son of Mizraim; also called Lydians. It is probable that the Ludim were settled to the west of Egypt, perhaps farther than any other Mizraite tribe. Lud and the Ludim are mentioned in four passages of the prophets . Nubians were the elite soldiers of Ancient Egypt. The Medjay was the name Ancient Egyptians gave to a region in Nubia. They became part of the Ancient Egyptian military as scouts. The first mention of the Medjay in written records dates back to the Old Kingdom, Medjay - Wikipedia \"We have come to serve Pharaoh\": A study of the Medjay and Pangrave as an ethnic group and as mercenaries from c. 2300 BCE until c. 1050 BCE Timeline of the kingdoms: http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-sta... 9 A. The story of Joseph is written in the Hebrew and Christian bible as well as in the Quran. There is even scientific evidence that helps to support the case of a historical Joseph in Egypt. ... In Arabic it's the Bahr Yusef. BBC - Religions - Judaism: Joseph 10. Archaeology is an important science that confirms the historical accuracy of the Bible. Let\u2019s look at some Old kingdom statues, maps, and scrolls of ancient Egypt. http://www.bible.ca/archeology/b... There is a Bust of Pharaoh Huni from 3rd dynasty. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huni  And a bust of Pharaoh Suhure from the 5th Dynasty https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa...  Mentuhotep II of the 11th Dynasty   Nubians Were Pharaohs and Queens (Including but not just limited to 25th Dynasty). This is proven by the tomb drawings from Mentuhotep II temple complex painting is from the inside of Queen Aashyt chamber in Mentuhotep II temple.  Further proof of KUSH. The Sixteenth Century B.C.E., \u201cKush\u201d is a colony of Kmt. Indeed, Kmt sends certain Viziers to govern Kush, called \u201cThe Prince [King\u2019s Son] of Kush\u201d: Vizier Amenhetep Huy is such a \u201cPrince of Kush,\u201d albeit in The Eighteenth Dynasty. Thus, The Hieroglyphs that correspond to \u201cKush\u201d predates The so-called 25th/Nubian/Kushite Dynasty by [at least] a millennium.  The pictures I posted of ancient Pharaohs, like Pharaohs Huni look very Sub-Saharan African. They have slanted eyes.Epicanthic fold or Mongoloid fold. This fold is throughout the world. Found in Asia, Native Americans, South African San people, etc.Epicanthic fold - Wikipedia.Though its appearance in peoples of Southeast Asia can be linked to possible descent from cold-adapted ancestors, its occurrence in various African peoples precludes a cold-adaptive explanation for it appearing in the latter groups.The epicanthic fold found in some African people has been tentatively linked to protection for the eye from the high levels of ultraviolet light found in desert and semi-desert areas.Example: The Khoisan's have no East Asian DNA but have slanted eyes because of their ancestry of living in desert.
