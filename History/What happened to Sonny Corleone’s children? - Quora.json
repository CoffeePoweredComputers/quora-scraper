            "answer_text": "They were well cared for by Sonny\u2019s widow and the the rest of the Corleone family. Sonny\u2019s Kids do appear in the later films, always at the large family gatherings that are a staple of each film\u2019s intro. Francesca and Kathryn are easiest to spot in these scenes, since they stand out more as twins, always wearing the same outfits. Santino Jr., and Frank are likely in these scenes/wide shots also, but are more difficult to spot, since they are never explicitly named or have any lines of dialogue. In Godfather 2 there is an extended/extra scene where Francesca asks Michael\u2019s blessing to marry her boyfriend, Gardner Shaw, which Michael happily assents to, contrasting sharply with his later rejection of Connie\u2019s request to marry her new beau, Merle. And of course there's always Vincent Mancini, Sonny\u2019s illegitimate son, and he got a whole film to answer the question what happened to him. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, if you watched Godfather part III, remember that Vincent Corleone is Sonny's illegitimate child. Remember the brunette at Connie's wedding that Sonny is boinking in the guest room when the Don sends for Sonny and Tom Hagen is knocking on the door. The woman is Vincent's mother. In Godfather part III Vincent eventually takes over the family when Michael retired. As for Sonny's legitimate children, they nor his wife where ever really a part of the story after the scene where he gets cut in half at the toll booth. ",
