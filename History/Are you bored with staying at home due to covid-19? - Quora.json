            "answer_text": "Dont worry.Covid 19 is not for lifetime.Feel happy amd only live with enjoy.here some trics to do in lockdown. Reading all new stuff 1.The first thing you should do is reading. Read and read a lot. Study about something you find exciting. Change the genre of books you usually read; not just fiction, try to read the autobiography of famous and inspirational personalities, like those of Barack Obama, APJ Abdul Kalam, and Jawaharlal Nehru. 2. Learn new things; Craft, Paintings or may be Sculpturing Next, you could take up a craft. Like crocheting, knitting or loom knitting, this is simple. Look up Knifty Knitter on Google and it will show you what it is. Get some yarn, learn how to make hats and donate them to the homeless and persons in need. Giving back to the community where you live helps alleviate boredom and give a sort of pleasure. 3. Open your artistic side Get some colouring books and colours. It\u2019s a good way to open up the artistic side of yourself, and it is fun. Express your thoughts and fantasies with paint and brush. Believe me, drawing and painting is the most soothing way of helping your brain evacuate all the junk and refresh for all new learning. 4. Sing, dance and explore new tunes These can be the best activities to keep you fresh and enthusiastic. Open yourself to better things in the world and realize that there's more to life than what you have. Learn a new form of dance from youtube. Sing your favuorite songs, record, listen and share with your friends. Believe me, it will be all fun. If you have any musical instrument at home, then it's the best time to play with it. Learn to play new tunes. Hopefully, you will discover something to do that will take away your boredom. 5. Make realistic goals, think about future plans Yes, this is the most important and helpful thing to remove the boredom. Ask yourself about what your aim is and what exactly you are doing in order to achieve your goals. For a student, time is the most valuable resource; thus, one has to identify the most important tasks that add value to one's education and focus on them. You should try to set aside a specific period during the day/night when the energy levels are high to perform the most important tasks. Make a full-proof plan for your career, reaching the goal and achieving that feat. Start working: Identify your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies. Find out where you want to be 10 years down the line. 6. Make some travel plans for future Though at this time, you should not even think of stepping out of your home but you can think about it for future vacations. You can make a list of places you would want to visit during your winter vacation. You can read about your favourite destinations, it'll make you ecstatic. 7. Meditate This is the biggest stress reliever given the fact that we people have to deal with a lot of stress daily in our life. Our brain is mostly like a boiling pressure cooker and it definitely needs rest so that the body can rejuvenate and heal itself for oncoming activities. 8. Talk to people We are social beings we need to talk to people. Start conversations online, even with strangers but in a constructive manner. When you interact with people you don't know, you get the chance to break out of your comfort zone and change your view of reality altogether. This can spark creative ideas, give you new ideas to think about, and plenty more and in the end you will get a new friend. ",

We can\u2019t go out to chill with friends anytime we want. There are no more Saturday Night Discos. Even going out for movies isn\u2019t the same anymore. Life has somehow become boring and \u2018not-so-happening\u2019 all of a sudden. Even though we are still burdened from just the same amount of workload, targets and meetings, the FUN factor kind of seems to be missing from our lives. If you too feel your days being dragged like nothing else, the highlight of your days missing and there seems to the feeling of missing out, there worry not. There are ways and means by which we can make the most of this time that we all have and enjoy it to the fullest. There are many activities that can be done by one and all to enjoy the little things in our lives. Try out some of the activities mentioned in this post and enjoy the quarantine period. https://blog.madcrayons.com/favourite-quarantine-entertainment/ ",

            "answer_text": "Not exactly bored. But I feel a bit overwhelmed and feel the need to go outside and get some fresh air sometimes. I\u2019m an introvert, which means that the activities I enjoy to do are by 90\u201395% non-extroverted activities (e.g., going to clubs or social events etc). So staying home is not really a problem with me, as long as I use my time productively. And I do use my time productively because I\u2019m busy with University work. Therefore, my every day at home is reading the required readings from my textbooks, watching online lectures and writing my notes, attending tutorials, research journal articles and anything needed to work on my upcoming assignments, preparing for the final exams in June and in the end of the day I have a mental breakdown due to my exhaustion. And while I\u2019m not overloading my brain with scientific research, statistics and Freud, I read a book (even though I read 60 pages of uni textbook!) watch YouTube vdeos, spend my time on Quora reading answers and chatting or finding something interesting to work on. If I decide to get out of the house, I\u2019ll just go for a short morning walk and at the shops IF I need something. Other than that, I\u2019m okay. But I need to take it a bit easy and handle my stress more effectively. ",
