            "answer_text": "No. Eating meat is a luxury. What do you think takes more money and effort to produce? Corn, wheat, rice, beans, other veggies\u2026 or beef and bacon? Only rich societies consider \u2018meat\u2019 a staple. Heck, 100 years ago it wasn\u2019t considered a staple in the US. Some US president ran on a platform of \u2018a chicken in every pot\u2019 because back then, people only ate meat like twice a week and looked forward to those days. Hoover. Herbert Hoover\u2026 1928. I Googled it 8 ) Now, I can see an argument if you somehow assume vegans eat primarily imitation \u2018meat\u2019 products\u2026 but my sister and nephew rarely eat them. Usually just when our mum cooks for the holidays. I mainly eat them because A) they\u2019re cheap and B) I\u2019m lazy. It\u2019s much easier to make a sandwich (with Field Roast imitation deli slices and Vegenaise) than it is to cook up some rice and beans. Still, the majority of my diet tends to be veggies, tofu and seitan, that sort of thing. I love curries, Mujadara, stir fries, bean burritos, chili\u2026 Don\u2019t much like salads, never jumped on that bandwagon, but I do like coleslaw, potato salad\u2026 actually, potatoes in any form\u2026 and raw veggies with hummus. I recommend carrots and cauliflower. Those are my personal favorite dipping veggies. I\u2019m not saying people shouldn\u2019t eat meat. Being vegan or vegetarian or not is a personal choice. But let\u2019s get some perspective here\u2026 choosing to be vegan is not a luxury. Hamburgers on every other corner is a luxury. 8 ) ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know about vegan, but being vegetarian is both cheaper and more moral then eating meat.I think that almost everyone can afford to stop eating meat in several months, becoming vegetarian - without any health problem. There might be exceptions, of course, with some more or less rare illnesses, I don't know, it's better to consult a doctor.I think that going vegetarian from vegan is more complex issue - both healthwise and morally. The safe bet is to stop eating meat ASAP. Like, gradually decreasing meat eating in several months then stopping to eat it. First stopping to eat mammals and birds, then fish and ocean creatures. Some few lapses are okay, it's like getting rid of an unhealthy habit - it requires some willpower but then you are glad you are now free of it. Meat gradually becomes disgusting, the smell and sight - like looking at body parts (which meat actually is). You then wonder how you could do such a monstrous thing as regularly eating flesh of animals killed because of it. But you are glad that you no longer do it. ",
