            "answer_text": "In the true sense no , but would be considered to of been built in the Victorian style . A true Victorian building is one built during her reign of 1837 until 1901 . My own is pre Victorian by 4 years but much of its features are reminiscent of that period and Georgian in age but the two styles blended together for a few years. Notable difference was the the Windows that went from about 16 small pane to 4 larger panes and let in more light . Prior to Victoria's reign town or city housing was far less in number and was generally owned by wealthy people , when the industrial revolution was fully underway housing was needed for workers in factories and homes were built to accommodate them , cheap as possible but functional . The wealthy had theirs built with the same grandeur to denote their status but with ideas coming from houses built abroad many who had made their money from the industrial revolution and were the new wealth rather than that which had been inherited . These tried to emulate the titled with the new wealth and the grandeur associated with the titled into their own propertys . It was not only an industrial revolution but a people's one as well where ordinary folk owned large houses and property and continues today with probably more multi millionaires from ordinary backgrounds than those with titles , of whom many had to sell their homes to ordinary folk to pay things such as death duties . The next era came with the Edwardian period with those houses having more windows and light but was only short lived. The next was probably the coronation of Queen Elizabeth 11 when council houses were built in commemoration for ordinary people after the war and many can be found in towns and villages across the land . There are 50s ,60s and 70s housing but since the coronation there has been no true definition of era as homes have built in numerous styles . ",

Most buildings of the period weren\u2019t architect-designed in the modern, bespoke sense but were generic, in effect being created from a template, published in the form of \u2018pattern books\u2019.*  (See How to tell if your property is Georgian, Victorian or Edwardian ) The buildings that followed these publications can be described as \u2018Victorian\u2019 even if built in the 20th Century but the further they get from the actual, active reign of Victoria the more they become a pastiche, much like the Tudor Revival style that is also called \u2018Tudorbethan\u2019, which eschewed the intricacies of the Jacobethan period instead paying homage to the Merrie England period. (It was supposed the past embodied all that was cosy and quaint, particularly by the \u2018arts and crafts\u2019 set, as they generally considered contemporary generic styles in mass-produced materials - from furniture to complete buildings - to be inherently ugly and if functional, as much of Victorian industrial architecture was, literally brutal.) * See Victorian Houses and Their Details for an example (Google Books).

            "answer_text": "I'll preface this by saying this is from an American's point of view, since we use this term too. Since Victoria died in 1901, anything built later, up to about WW1 is considered Edwardian. However, there were many different styles during these monarchs' reigns. Under Victoria we see revivals of many earlier periods, including Gothic, Italianate and Italian villa, Elizabethian, Jacobean (sometimes mashed together as Jacobethian), Renaissance revival, Rococo revival, Second empire, Beaux arts, Eastlake/Stick style, English arts and crafts, Colonial revival, and Georgian revival. The more ornate styles tend to be lumped under the term \u201cVictorian\u201d, but really are distinct style expressions. In Edward's reign, we see more arts and crafts, art nouveau, colonial revival, prairie school, mission, and the start of modernism. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe. It depends on the style, not the era. You could conceivably build a \u201cVictorian\u201d style house complete with asymmetrical facade, fancy gingerbread trim and drop rails, and a big wraparound porch and a turret or two today - it would still be Victorian but not historic. By 1901 Craftsman style houses were beginning to appear on the market - a very different style of house with a completely different design philosophy behind them than Victorians. So without additional detail, I can\u2019t verify the house you speak of is Victorian just by name alone. The proper way to identify a historic house is to learn how to identify architectural styles and refer to the house by its style. When it was built is not a good way to say it\u2019s Victorian or Greek Revival or Ranch style or whatever. ",

            "answer_text": "Victorian and Edwardian are historical periods not styles of architecture. People often refer to the Queen Anne style or Carpenter Gothic or other ornate styles popular during Victoria\u2019s reign as Victorian though this is not really accurate. If you are using the term Victorian as a vague reference to some styles of building then any building adhering sufficiently to one of those styles could be considered Victorian. If you mean to refer to buildings built in that historical era it would apply to any building built during Victoria\u2019s reign regardless of style. If you want to be accurate use the actual name for the style. ",
