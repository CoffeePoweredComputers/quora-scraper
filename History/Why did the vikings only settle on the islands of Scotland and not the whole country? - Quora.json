            "answer_text": "The Vikings settled parts of mainland Scotland, and there are place names that indicate long-term Norse settlement. However, they tended to settle the peripheries of the mainland for the same reason the Romans built Hadrian\u2019s Wall: the terrain (from a military perspective) was harsh, and the people indomitable. During the invasions that led to the creation of the Danelaw in England, attempts were made to invade north into Scotland, but they failed. The Norse figured out quickly that taking Scotland would be a very difficult and costly enterprise without enough return to justify it. And to top it off, Southern England was a much more alluring prize because of better farming lang and more people to take and sell as slaves. All of this, of course, keeping in mind that the primary sources we have on the subject are sparse, and it is impossible to know for sure the motivations (or lack thereof) of the Norse settlers in Scotland outside of what we can deduce from observations of their efforts in England and Ireland.

            "answer_text": "The Vikings raided all over what is now Scotland and the rest of the British Isles. The Norsemen settled all over the place. They had bases in Orkney, Shetland, The Western Isles, The Isle of Man, Ireland, The Eastern half of what is now England, Caithness, Sutherland and the Eastern half of present day Scotland. In fact they settled in a lot of places in Great Britain and Ireland. Their other main base outwith Scandinavia was Normandy (Norseman\u2019s land). ",
