            "answer_text": "Moose Jaw is a small city (or large town, if you will) in Southern Saskatchewan. There were tunnels dug from there under the U.S. border (by associates of Al Capone, if memory serves) in order to smuggle booze into the U.S. during prohibition. Today, I believe they are a tourist attraction. ",
