            "answer_text": "Because it wsn\u2019t a genocide. Do you even know what a genocide is? The war began in December 1979, and lasted until February 1989. About 15,000Soviet soldiers were killed, and about 35,000 were wounded. About two million Afghan civilians were killed. During World War Two over 3 million German civilians were killed during the war, mostly by Allied bombing, Are you going to call the war a genocide as well? Ten million Soviet civilians were killed during the war. And 17 percent of the Polish population died during the war (mostly as civilians) is that genocide as well? Over 60 million people died during World War Two, and over 40 million were civilians at the time. Peaple die in a war, does NOT make it a genocide. I suggest you look up genocide before you state accussing people of it. ",
