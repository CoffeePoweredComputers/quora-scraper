            "answer_text": "A little more reading background on ancient Greece might be helpful here. Rights of women? There were pretty much none. Not sure what you mean by minorities. And the concept of an LGBTQA community existing outside the late 20th/early 21st century is profoundly ahistorical. Yes, there were sexual relationships between older men and male youths, but they would not have defined themselves as \u201cgay\u201d or \u201chomosexual.\u201d They defined themselves as basically \u201cactive\u201d or \u201cpassive\u201d partners. Women were considered so unimportant that we know nothing about their intimate lives (apart from Sappho). ",

            "answer_text": "In cities like Athens, male and female prostitutes existed and were the norm. If you were a woman, you\u2019d better hope you were born in Sparta, the one with the most rights for women, but Athens did allow women to divorce erring husbands\u2026.Alcibiades almost found himself an ex- but he made it to the magistrate in time to talk his wife out of it. Outside of Sparta being a woman was not pleasant, but it you didn\u2019t know any better, you just accepted it as norm. ",
