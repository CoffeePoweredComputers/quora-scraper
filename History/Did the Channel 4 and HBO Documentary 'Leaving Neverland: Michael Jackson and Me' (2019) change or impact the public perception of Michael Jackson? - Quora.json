            "answer_text": "People who don\u2019t know the FACTS about these allegations and are brainwashed by the tabloid and even the mainstream media may be convinced by this mockumentary because it is graphic. Graphic however is NOT truthful. People who have read the accusers\u2019 complaints , depositions , motions , lawsuits cannot possibly believe them because they are proven liars , hence their lawsuits were dismissed. Leaving Neverland is the result of a 6 year frivolous litigation which has so far ended in favour of the Estate. Robson and Safechuck got NOTHING , Robson was even ordered to pay the Estate\u2019s 100.000 $ attorney fees , he is officially broke , he is desperate for attention and money, his career is in the toilet. Safechuck joined the bandwagon for MONEY because he is cash strapped. The truth is that Robson and Safechuck are given a huge platform because they accuse Michael Jackson. If they said this nonsense about anyone else NOBODY would have believed them . Why ? Because the both denied any sex abuse FOR years , even as adults , including UNDER OATH , and they alleged molestation for MONEY when they were both broke. They have made preposterous claims , they have changed their story several times , they have lied about other people being abused , like Culkin and Barnes , who have however vehemently denied it. Though i do understand that it may take years for a child to process the abuse they endured and trauma can be confusing for victims this DOES NOT explain why Robson provably lied UNDER OATH so brazenly that the Judge threw out his entire Witness Statement and said NO rational juror could ever believe his story. Robson and Safechuck may claim they are not getting paid by HBO but they have an ongoing , gigantic lawsuit for 100 million $which they are trying to appeal. Unsurprisingly , this is NOT included in this mockumentary. Leaving Neverland is a cash grab: it is shamelessly one sided , devoid of facts and entirely reliant on sensationalism. The media have always insisted upon MJ\u2019s guilt with zero evidence because they made MONEY. Michael Jackson was a gold mine for them. Imagine how much money the media made off slandering Michael Jackson if they were willing to pay people thousands of dollars to lie about him !!! The bad story sells!!! The press is animalistic. The media are owned by evil people. This is an agenda driven documentary . Michael Jackson is used as a smokescreen for the real predators of Hollywood , like Harvey Weinstein , David Geffen , Steven Spielberg . There was a documentary about Harvey Weinstein who has so far been accused of rape and sexual harassment by 80 women , who NEVER defended , testified for and spoke highly of Weinstein and they can actually keep their story straight. It deliberately got NO ATTENTION AT ALL. Oprah is good friends with Weinstein . Not only did she know what he did all these years and she shielded him BUT she provided him with victims. She has NEVER interviewed any of her buddy\u2019s victims but she is willing to interview two men , who , firstly , have NO credibility and they already had their lawsuits thrown out of court, because they were caught in numerous lies , and apart from salacious , ever- changing stories they provide NO proof to back up their allegations. Oprah watched the \u2018\u2019 documentary \u2018\u2019 on Geffen\u2019s yacht on her birthday. She has NO qualms hanging out with a notorious pedophile like Geffen( who MJ called the gay mafia and said he sank his career ) , she is in fact his puppet , but , she is willing to believe two self admitted liars. It is no coincidence this is timed on the verge of the 10th anniversary of MJ\u2019s death and it is no coincidence NBC had a tribute for Elvis while the media slandered MJ. There is a systematic effort to ruin MJ\u2019s legacy. I don\u2019t believe it will be successful. HBO does NOT care about sex abuse , they care about ratings , they care about profit!!! Why didn\u2019t they ever have a documentary about Corey Feldman who was indeed abused in Hollywood but he always said that MJ was innocent? Or Heather O Rourke \u2018s mysterious death ( she was in fact sodomized to death ) ? Why don\u2019t they do a documentary about Jerry Sandusky who had 35 accusers and he was indeed convicted or Kevin Spacey or Roman Polanski ? This is NOT a documentary about sex abuse. They are deliberately trying to destroy MJ even in death as they did when he was alive. In fact , Robson and Safechuck are an insult to real sex abuse victims. They are opportunists and liars. No doubt HBO wants to tarnish Michael Jackson\u2019s image. No doubt the accusers want MONEY. I don\u2019t know if HBO and Leaving Neverland will change or impact the public perception of Michael Jackson. But i do know they are trying to ruin him. Hopefully they will not be successful. ",

            "answer_text": "The ones that had defended him for decades will only defend him more and become aggressive. The thing is, the ones that we call fans, sometime just become blinded. It's if MJ was perfect to them. That he couldn't make any bad decisions or bad moves or even harm anyone. Let's not forget he was human and humans make mistakes. I read comments in Quora and other places about MJ and what the fans say about him it just shows how sick it is. Sometimes they put on picture of Jim and say he was so beautiful, when you see picture of him the last 10-20 years. Please!!!! Come on! He did so much surgery you could even recognize the man! The diference was huge from the real MJ!!! And no one can tell me he looke fine or natural! These fans become so obsessed and can't see things how they realy are. For the ones that hated him, well they will only have him even more. And for good reasons. Even if he was found not guilty, the man had and odd attitude. Not only with kids, but with women. I kno some will say he whanted his life to be private. And I respect that. But he gave all the reason for people to see him guilty and odd. I love MJ's art, music and dance. But I still wonder what if? Did he molested those kids? Why did he have the need to be surrounded with kids? Yes he was found not guilty, but what if? I did not see the document and don't have any intention of watching it. But I do think that many like me loved MJ and didn't think he was guilty, but after watching the documentary maby they will have a change of heart. I repeat I kno he was found not guilty but so many things can make you believe the contrary. I do hope for his kids and family, one day this will be in the past. I hope for them some day people will stop talking about it. ",
