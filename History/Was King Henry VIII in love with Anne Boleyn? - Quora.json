            "answer_text": "I believe Henry lacked the capability to truly love someone. He was obsessed with Anne Boleyn and he stalked her relentlessly. She told him she would be no man\u2019s mistress because of her intense religious faith, but he still wouldn\u2019t leave her alone. She even quit her prestigious job as a maid of honor to the queen to try to salvage some shreds of her reputation, but he followed her and stayed at a friend\u2019s house so he could ride over at his leisure and pester her some more. She refused to answer his letters, sent back his gifts, and tried as hard as she could to decline him politely. She had to walk a delicate balance and remain firm while not infuriating him, which would bring down repercussions on her family. Finally, he presented her with an offer she literally could not refuse: she would become his wife. Once he got rid of his other wife, that is. Thomas Wyatt depicted her as a deer in the hunt, in one of his poems, a collar around her neck marking her as the king\u2019s. It\u2019s particularly chilling when you realize this poem depicted a staged hunt, as many of the king\u2019s deer hunts were. The deer would be trapped in an enclosure to be chased and picked off by the hunters. The best deer would be marked as belonging to the king so he could shoot it down himself. She never had a chance of escape. And though she seemed \u201ctame,\u201d she had a wild longing to be free. This is all part of the historical record, yet people still accuse her of \u201cluring\u201d the king on, \u201cmaking\u201d him chase her, and then \u201cmaking\u201d him marry her because he could get her no other way. During the seven years it took for him to rid himself of Katharine of Aragon, Henry built Anne up into a fantasy woman in his head, the Son-Dispensing Dream Girl\u2014 who would always be exciting, yet placid, who would always be perfectly conformed to his every desire, who would have no thoughts but pleasing him, and who would provide him with a pile of sons he could rub in the face of those who said he was wrong for what he was doing to Katharine and the church. But once he actually possessed the object of his obsession, reality asserted itself. It turned out Anne was a flesh-and-blood woman. Her first child was a worthless girl, and people were laughing at him for not being able to flaunt the son he\u2019d promised it would be. When they\u2019d been courting, he\u2019d encouraged her plans for the Church of England, including using the money from the dissolved monasteries to found schools so the English people could read the Bible she wanted translated into English. Once he held those coins in his hot hands, however, the idea of building those schools faded as quickly as his obsession. And Anne had the gall to complain about that. And about his attention to other women when she was pregnant. She had the unmitigated gall to be a person. Henry\u2019s obsession with Anne soured into hatred that she hadn\u2019t been his Dream Girl. In his mind, she deserved her murder because she hadn\u2019t delivered on what he thought she\u2019d promised. She\u2019d tricked him with her lack of perfection. And so she would have to die so he could have the next thing he wanted. This new woman was one who carefully studied his wants and desires so she could appear to be absolutely conformist. Jane Seymour had the help of several plotters in the court who gave her insights into Henry\u2019s character, and so she was presented to him as an absolutely bland and placid creature without a thought in her head except pleasing the king. Historians sometimes still depict her this way \u2014 as sweet and gentle and passive, a log carried downstream without any will of her own. Later, after he married her, this second Dream Girl would try to assert her own personality and ambitions and Henry would warn her to take heed of what happened to the last woman who did that. She quickly reverted to her role. She was polite enough to die before he could tire of her, which made her the Perfect Wife indeed, and earned her a place buried beside him. The corpses of the other women unfortunate enough to become objects of his obsession would be scattered elsewhere. Two headless. ",

            "answer_text": "Possibly, to a limited extent though most of her relationships were lust motivated. Daughters of even minor gentry families (as the Boleyns were originally) grew up with the idea of making a good marriage, which was essential one to someone of high lineage or great wealth, preferable both. Love was not a thing a wise girl expected or went in for. Henry Percy was heir to an ancient earldom, the only drawback being that it was based in the north, away from court and all the excitement. Then Anne spotted a better opportunity - the King himself was taking an interest. She dropped Percy and bent all her energies to catching him - not as her sister Mary had done, as a mistress, but, as she could see, the chance of becoming Queen, since Catherine was ageing and had no surviving sons nor was likely to. Anne was a political animal, willing to sell herself if she could be sure of the top spot. She managed to hold Henry\u2019s interest, on promise of a male heir (and french tricks in the bedroom). It was only after acgieving the crown that she gave her all, produced a child which proved to be a girl, and before doing the job she had been selected for, turned to other men for actaul sport. (The parallels with Diana, though she did do the heir, are scary). Anne relied on her hold over Henry too long, since there were other younger ladies available to take over. Anne was caught entertaining several young men, so henry ould not have been sure of the provenance of a male heir -and she was executed. ",
