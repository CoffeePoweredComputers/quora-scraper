            "answer_text": "I would have to say it\u2019s the combination of all the branches elite. Which fall under The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM or SOCOM). The command is part of the Department of Defense and is the only Unified Combatant Command legislated into being by the U.S. Congress. A subordinate command Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) is a component command of the USSOCOM and is charged to study special operations requirements and techniques to ensure interoperation and conduct special operations exercises and training, and develop Joint Special Operations Tactics. Units that make up JSOC: The U.S. Army's 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, popularly known as Delta Force. The Intelligence Support Activity (ISA, The Activity) The U.S. Army's 75th Ranger Regimental Reconnaissance Company (formerly known as Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment/RRD) The U.S. Navy's Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU, SEAL Team Six) is the second of the two counter-terrorism, special mission units that fall under the Joint Special Operations Command. DEVGRU is the U.S. Navy's counterpart to Delta, specializing in maritime counter-terrorism. The Air Force 24th Special Tactics Squadron (24th STS) is the AFSOC component of JSOC. The 24th STS consists of specially selected AFSOC personnel, including Pararescuemen, Combat Controllers, and Tactical Air Command Party (TACPs.) The Joint Communications Unit (JCU) is a technical unit of the United States Special Operations Command charged to standardize and ensure interoperability of communication procedures and equipment of the Joint Special Operations Command and its subordinate units. Portions of JSOC units have made up the constantly changing special operations task force, operating in the U.S. Central Command area of operations. The Task Force 11, Task Force 121, Task Force 6\u201326 and Task Force 145 are creations of the Pentagon's post-11 September campaign against terrorism, and it quickly became the model for how the military would gain intelligence and battle insurgents in the future. As Mark Krudy pointed out I unintentionally left out a very important group: Didn\u2019t mean to intentionally, but yes your correct (MARSOC) Marine Raider Regiment (Marine Raiders) consists of a Headquarters Company and three Marine Raider Battalions, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd. Marine Intelligence Battalion (MIB) trains, equips, structures, and provides specially qualified Marine forces Marine Special Operational Support Group (MSOS) performs the screening, recruiting, training, assessment and doctrinal development functions for MARSOC. It includes two subordinate Special Missions Training Branches (SMTBs), one on each coast and the Marine Special Mission Training Branch-East provide special operations training in tactics, techniques and procedures, and evaluation and certification of MARSOC forces to specified conditions and standards for SOF.

            "answer_text": "It depends what the operation is. The US military trains different forces for different types of operations. The special forces often get the most notice due to the physical requirements and operational dangers in the operations they perform. However the Blue Angels one of the most skilled segments of pilots in the US Air Force, with only 126 Airforce personnel assigned to the unit. Navy Seal Team 6 is popularized as one of the most specialized Seal Teams. Delta Force groups are seen as a unique black ops style group.  Like the Seals US Marines Force Recon, Devil Dogs are veiwed as elite within the Marines. With Marines often viewed as the first boots on the ground, marine deep recon forms a group tasked with operating with minimal support much like groups such as the Seals. Bear in mind that both Marine Recon and Army Ranger's are in a way not seen as super elite, they are task specialized, but definately seen as SOF.  I find groups like ISA to be mostly unheard of, yet still seemingly fullfilling an important role in the US military. They are elite of the elite as they are drawn from US Army Special Forces.   Meanwhile SAD is also something not seen in the limelight so again this is an elite group due to its secrecy,  and it is also drawn from former SOF.  For the SOF the 160th may be seen as elite of the elite. The 1st Air Operations group is unique. MSOR or Marine Raiders are also highly mobile and skilled.  Of them all I would say ISA and more so SAD is viewed as the elite of the elite.  So oddly the most elite of all US military forces is tasked to the CIA.  However, the training of all these forces has extreme physical requirement as well as capabilities not found elsewhere.  Lots of US forces are training in specific operations, groups involved in rescue and intelligence gathering responsible to conduct themselves covertly on high geopolitical risk operations tend to be viewed as the elite of the elite.
