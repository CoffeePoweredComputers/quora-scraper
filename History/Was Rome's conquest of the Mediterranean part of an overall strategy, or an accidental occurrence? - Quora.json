            "answer_text": "Rome\u2019s history from the early days was one of conquest and absorption of neighbouring cities and countryside. Much of this was in response to real or perceived aggression by their opponents. The first time they came into hostile contact with anyone from outside Italy was when Pyrrhus of Epirus led an army across the Adriatic to come to the aid of Tarentum, which found itself at war with Rome, early in the 3rd century BCE, which led to Rome\u2019s hegemony over the Greek cities of southern Italy and completed their hold on Italy as a whole. By this time, too, Rome had begun to seek alliances further afield, and it was a threat to allies in Sicily by an increasingly ambitious and expansionist Carthage that led to a war in Sicily, the First Punic War. Carthage had been for many years a trading partner of Rome, with treaties of friendship going back as far as 509 BCE. The Romans were quite hesitant about getting involved in war in Sicily, but accepted an appeal from Messana, and found themselves engaged in a complex and bloody war that lasted from 264 to 241 BCE, and led to the successful creation of the first Roman navy. Victory in this war enabled Rome to annexe Sicily as a province, and demand large reparations from Carthage: these included Carthage ceding Corsica and Sardinia to Rome after a short secondary conflict in 237. Very clearly the annexation of Sicily was unplanned, and indeed the Roman Senate had nearly rejected the plea for help from Messana. It was not until after the Second Punic War (218\u2013201 BCE) that Rome became the unchallenged leading power in the Mediterranean. The defeat of Carthage gave them much of Iberia. Meanwhile Carthage\u2019s alliance with Macedonia had led to a Macedonian war within the war with Carthage (214\u2013205 BCE). Philip V of Macedon was trying to extend his power and influence in the Aegean, and Rhodes and Pergamon, who had been allied to Rome, appealed for help. Rome tried to use diplomacy to deter Philip, but when he took no notice, Rome went to war, and eventually defeated Philip decisively at Cynocephalae (197 BCE). Rome then withdrew their army, leaving their Greek allies to watch over Macedon. This left a power vacuum which the Seleucid Empire, Alexander\u2019s successor kingdom based in Syria attempted to fill. This eventually led to Rome invading Asia for the first time, defeating the Seleucids at Magnesia in 188 BCE. The story continues, with a further Macedonian war, war against the Achaean League and the destruction of Corinth; a third Punic War which led to the destruction of Carthage and the annexation of what became Roman Africa\u2026 It\u2019s hard to sum this all up as an answer to the question asked. Basically, Rome was initially drawn out of Italy more or less by accident. They might have ignored Messana\u2019s request, and never become involved in Sicily. (Which would almost certainly have been a strategic mistake). The First Punic War set in train a series of wars that took Rome into ever-wider geographical territory. Somewhere along this chain of events, it certainly became evident that there was not only booty to be won, but lands with resources that could be used to further Rome\u2019s prosperity. Starting with grain from Sicily, which was Rome\u2019s breadbasket before she acquired first north Africa and then Egypt, Spain offered silver mines and land for growing olives and vines. And so on. Very often, the wars embarked on were the result of broken treaties, or requests from allies. There was no overall strategic plan, and no obvious end to what became Rome\u2019s ambition - until you get the Augustan poets urging Augustus to go out and conquer India (or even more or less saying that he had done so). And it was Augustus who effectively put the brakes on expansion. Arguably, the only conquests that were deliberately planned were those of Gaul (which was Julius Caesar\u2019s personal plan to enrich himself and pay off his debts, as well as gaining military glory) and Illyria and its neighbours on the Danube frontier. It wasn't until Trajan decided to punish first the Dacians and then the Parthians that the empire reached its furthest extent. ",

            "answer_text": "Ever since it's overthrow of Tarquin Superbus the Latin race was subject to hostile powers on its borders and so involved in almost constant warfare.This continued until Rome as it was now called ran into the Greek colonisers of southern Italy and their defeat by Phyrus giving name to a Roman defest more a victory as the Roman political system remained intact. As Rome expanded it ran into the Carthaginian seafarers and conflict over Sardinia and Corsica.Rome\u2019s victories were more wars of survival rather than desire for expansion the state following upon its ancient wars with the Etruscans. Yo me it seems it was following a course ordained by nature rather than one bought about by greed.That is not to say there weren't many complaints especially from those at the bottom of the ladder having to bear the brunt of the fighting. The problems in Numidia saw a build up of the legions to such a degree as to allow for civil war,Sulla and Marius bringing about such destruction as to collapse the republic and introduce the imperial age of Augustus. There seemed no specific plan beyond go with the flow. ",
