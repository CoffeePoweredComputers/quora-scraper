            "answer_text": "A couple of things come to mind. One is not so creepy, just kind of odd, and the other is a bit creepy, but MAD creepy at the time. On one of our many family visits to NYC- I was probably 11 or 12 this time- we went into Midtown Manhattan to walk around and see everything lit up (it was just after Christmas, kind of a tradition that we went to stay at my aunt and uncle`s apartment in between Christmas and New Year). Sometime in the afternoon, we had split up from my Mom, I guess she wanted to go shopping and us men folk didn`t, so we went into a cafe in Rockefeller Center to wait for her. It was my Dad, my brother, and me, sitting in this cramped and super loud cafe (it was New York City, remember). After a few minutes of sitting there, I distinctly heard my Mom`s voice call out my brother`s name. I looked around, and that`s when I noticed my brother had heard it too. I confirmed that he had heard what I had, he said yes. My Dad, on the other hand, hadn`t heard anything, and was just reading a newspaper. About 5\u201310 minutes later, my Mom showed up for real.Now, this one has a pretty rational explanation. It could have been we both heard another woman call out to someone with the same name as my brother (we`ll say it`s George), there`s bound to be more than one person with that name in one city. It was just weird how it sounded exactly like Mom and we both heard it over everyone else. 2. Fast forward about a dozen years. I`m living in Prague and currently staying with some friends before heading home in a month or so. I`ve taken a night off partying (there was a lot of that in Prague). It`s just me in the apartment, sitting on my laptop and chilling, with total silence in the apartment. Now, I should note that Prague is a pretty freaking old city, and a lot of the apartments are as well. Therefore, the city comes with more than its fair share of ghost stories and spooky anecdotes. So, I`m lying there minding my own business when I hear noises in the kitchen, like someone getting ready to eat. I hear plastic unwrapping, I hear the sink turn on and off, but no one ever comes out of the kitchen. I have a full view of the apartment from my position, and I`m wide awake, so I would have heard someone come in and there was only one actual bedroom in the whole place, and that door had been closed all night. My friend who was actually renting the place had told me before that he had heard evidence of a ghost in the apartment before and I always thought he was just playing around, but at that moment, I kinda believed him. The noises only went on for a minute or two, and then stopped. Several minutes later, my friend comes out of his room; he had been there the whole time, but must have been asleep. I suppose it`s possible in this case that someone could have come into the kitchen from the bathroom, which was located on the far side of the kitchen and not visible from my angle, but I heard no footsteps, and only my friend- who I didn`t see until he left- had any reason to go anywhere besides the living room, where I was. Unless there was a side door connecting his room to the kitchen that I somehow never saw, it was totes the ghost. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know about strange or mysterious but these all make me wonder if these were meaningful events or strange coincidences. When I was a little child one of my earliest memories is being at the seaside feeling very sad and knowing I was going to die when I was 39. Such a weird thing to think as a child but I would feel this way alot, and it stayed with me to such an extent that I had anxiety about it whenever the thoughts arose over the following years. It affected my life as I was totally convinced it would happen. This belief, and other things happening in my life, led to a period of deep depression. Did I die at 39? No, but my oldest sister did. The sister who meant everything to me. Who I would run to if I was scared as a child, my pseudo mom when my mom was busy looking after the other kids. Sudden massive heart attack at 39. Totally unexpected . Coincidence? Who knows. Another thing with me is I am rarely aware of dreaming, with the exception of rare vivid dreams. One such dream was a lovely experience. A Manager at my company was dying. He was a lovely man who had suffered from depression and recognised it in me at work and truly helped me through a terrible time. In my dream I went to see him and sat by his sick bed and we had a really long, wonderful conversation about loads of things. How he helped me, laughter, touching moments and then a lovely goodbye. Each knowing it was a final goodbye. Then I woke up totally shocked that I was in my bed. I found out he died that weekend. Possibly another coincidence, but a nice one for me as it felt so real. I woke up another morning, got ready for work, had breakfast, got my bag and keys and went out my front door and stared in shock at my car as the front drivers side was all smashed in. Then I woke up and was still in bed. It was so vivid that I was totally confused convinced it had happened. The next morning same dream except I went out our side door, which I never did, my car was missing and I walked down our street looking for it, as you do, turned the corner and there's my car again with the same damage. Woke up again and thought weird but convinced it was because the first dream had played on my mind, Told my friends at work what a weirdo I was to have such stupid, irrelevant, dreams. Next morning, same dream, same routine, same damage in the same spot on my car. Told my friends again that they might have to send me to the funny farm as these dreams were so real. That night whilst giving a colleague a lift home a 5 year old kid ran out from a blind spot into the path of my car. My brakes screeched and I turned to avoid him. He actually pushed against my car and fell and hit his head, but was not badly hurt, thank God. I was totally shook up. His family were there and witnessed that he ran out to cross the road to his friends (after they had warned him not to) and didn't blame me but I still felt awful. It was only when I got home that I noticed his perfect little hand print in the spot where the \u2018damage\u2019 was in my dreams. I never had the dream again. Now, that just leaves a recurring dream from my childhood where I am driving down a country lane, turn left and look up to see a big white house (not quite a mansion, but getting there) and I know this house means something very important and then I wake up. Had it since I was too young to realise I was driving a car, and had it enough times since to recognise I am having \u2018that\u2019 dream again whilst in the dream My friends are aware of it and I have told them if I died at such a spot they would know the dream meant something, but I'm joking, I hope. We can make something of these, or nothing at all. They are what they are, coincidences or not. ",
