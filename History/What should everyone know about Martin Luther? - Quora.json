            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start with the central fact: few figures in post-medieval history are as commonly or deceptively misrepresented as Martin Luther. Given his role as the patron saint of Protestantism, one could argue he\u2019s had more influence on the modern western world than almost any other single person \u2014 a legacy which is far from a dusty, forgotten footnote. Just consider how many are singing his praises even now as part of the 500th anniversary celebrations of the era-defining Reformation he helped usher in. The troublesome thing is that his influence was almost exclusively for the worse. Ample historical evidence paints him as both a proud father of violent religious extremism and an enduring symbol of our own deep aversion to correcting the stories we tell ourselves about who we are and where we come from.  To preface what follows, I want to stress that this is not about vilifying one particular human being. It's about deconstructing a narrative for the purpose of better understanding how and why history is whitewashed to support specific agendas. To a careful reader, Luther's story is deeply instructive. In the popular mythology of his supporters, Luther was God's champion, a man of incredible courage who fought against an evil system bent on repression. His mission was as simple as it was pure: to ensure that men and women everywhere would have the liberty to read the Bible independently in their own language and to live out their faith free from external control. The historical record, in contrast, would suggest that this is a revisionist portrait of a deeply troubled man. To get a fuller sense of who he was and what his true legacy ought to be, we must consider him in view of the different roles he assumed over his controversial career. #1: The theologian. Of all his supposed accomplishments, most Protestants would point to his reclamation of the doctrine of \"by grace through faith\" as his greatest. The Sunday School version of this narrative suggests that the Catholic Church had migrated to a \"works-based\" model of salvation and that Luther alone had the insight and fortitude to speak for God against this heresy. The less quotable truth is that Rome never lost sight of the importance of grace. It taught, as it always had, that genuine faith should produce good works as evidence of its authenticity. This balanced view was as old as it was uncontroversial, being directly supported by the teachings of Jesus in the Gospels and thoroughly articulated in the Epistle of James. (True to form, Luther tried to remove the latter from the canon of the New Testament on the grounds that it was \"straw theology\".) #2: The reformer. If the Church's core doctrines weren\u2019t actually as removed from Scripture as Luther claimed, one might wonder what the whole Ninety-Five Theses hubbub was all about. Well, in brief, Luther was hot under the collar about the increasing abuse of indulgence sales (passes that purportedly cancelled out temporal punishment for sins, even in Hades). While the origins of the phenomenon were relatively innocent, the realities of it by the early 16th-century were much less wholesome. Some dealers were effectively claiming that the act of buying them was the sort of \u201cgood work\u201d that proved one\u2019s faith, going so far as to devise aggressive campaigns to drive churchgoers to buy them for their dead relatives. These salesmen had pragmatic motivations. The revenues from their sales were split, with part funding the construction of the very expensive St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and the rest going into their own pockets (partially to pay back the positions they\u2019d purchased). It was, in essence, a somewhat seedy fundraising campaign. (As an aside, there's a tremendous irony about the whole thing. One of the most widespread critiques of Protestant churches today is their practice of coercing congregants into tithing so that the local church can have an attractive building and paid staff. Given the minuscule trickle rate of donated funds to outside causes, it\u2019s hard to argue that the modern system isn\u2019t as if not more problematic than the one Luther railed so hard against.) Much of the financial chicanery in the church of Luther's day found its root in the personality and policies of Pope Leo X. Like many of the pontiffs of his era, he wasn't exactly a qualified leader for a spiritual organization. He was more of a patron than a priest. His concerns were about art and culture, not fine points of theology or bureaucratic happenings in the far-lying parishes of rural Germany. While Luther was right to call out the abuses that occurred under Leo's watch, the ways in which he did so were profoundly unhelpful. Though one can argue that his initial tone was fairly balanced and academic, it didn't stay that way for long. He quickly grew a universal reputation for approaching people in such a way as to make peaceful resolution impossible. After a few years of increasingly divisive back-and-forth dialogues (which Luther invariably escalated), he began calling the pope an Antichrist and advocating for an official schism. Though some modern Protestants like to suggest that a level of separation was both due and necessary (given the unhealthy and ostensibly unbiblical amount of power wielded by the pope), the newly \"freed\" churches under Luther didn't exactly experience improved circumstances. In 1522, during the height of the unfolding crises, Luther wrote the following: \u201cI do not admit that my doctrine can be judged by anyone, even by the angels. For since I am certain of it, I shall be your judge and even the angels\u2019 judge so that whoever does not accept my teaching may not be saved\u2014for it is God\u2019s and not mine. Therefore, my judgment is also not mine but God\u2019s.\u201d While Catholic popes had historically upheld the traditional doctrine of papal infallibility, they rarely held to it strongly in practice. They generally relied on the teams of scholars within the Curia to counsel them on issues of thorny doctrinal significance. Luther, meanwhile, in the act of presenting himself as an iconoclast, actually promoted more individual interpretations as \"unquestionable doctrines\" than any pontiff in history. It\u2019s also worth noting that the Church was already deeply aware of its excesses in the indulgences market. Several internal parties had articulated their concerns long before Luther fired his warning shot in Wittenberg. And though the Church has never been a fast-moving institution, it was hardly immovable. The wheels of reform were already in motion. Several rounds of restrictions were placed in the years following, with Pope Pious V finally banning their sale altogether in 1567. While one might argue that the other dissenting voices should have followed Luther's lead in opposing the abuses on a somewhat more aggressive timetable, it's impossible to endorse Luther's methods when the issue could have always been resolved via diplomatic (and more Christian) means. #3: The prophet. Whatever Luther's original intentions were, he gradually adopted the role of a persecuted prophet. As he did, his rhetoric took a sharp change for the worse, becoming increasingly haughty, narcissistic, and violent. It should be noted with some compassion that Luther was a deeply unhealthy man, both physically and psychologically. He was prone to severe depression and displayed qualities which match most classifications of megalomania. As one reads his story, it becomes impossible not to wonder how history might have gone differently had he been sympathized with rather than spurned. Tragically, help never came. And, in its absence, he became more and more entrenched in his self-authored presentment as \"warrior-scholar for the Almighty\" \u2014 the one true champion who cared about truth. We can summarize the depths he sank to by considering three of his representative works from the post-theses period: #3a: The Luther Bible, 1522 - 1534. If you were to do a poll among modern-day Christians, many would wrongly identify Luther's Bible as one of the first local-language translations ever published in Europe. Tracing the origin of that particular myth is beyond our scope here, but suffice it to say that said narrative is incredibly misleading. At the time of its publication, there were no less than eighteen other complete translations already existing in various German dialects. So why make another? Luther claimed that he wanted to give the people a translation from the original languages (rather than re-translating from the \"corrupted\" Latin Vulgate, as was the Catholic practice). He also wanted to use vernacular so that the \"common man\" could understand it. Were those his genuine motivations? None can say. But, without writing off those aspects as being necessarily false, we must consider others in addition. First, it was evident that Luther wanted a version of the Bible that supported and propagated his own doctrinal interpretations. This included slight but meaningful additions to the text (such as Romans 3:28), and the downgrading of certain books (such as James) to pseudo-canonical status for reasons unrelated to their historical authenticity. Second, he wanted to produce something that the German people could rally around as a means of separating themselves from Catholic identity. Did translating directly from Hebrew and Greek really improve the quality of the texts in any meaningful way? It's hard to argue in the affirmative given the limited manuscripts available and his own quite unimpressive expertise in the languages in question. A fair reading of the evidence suggests it was mostly about giving his faithful the pretext to believe they had the \"purest\" version. Lastly, it was about Luther himself. Though much of the translation work was done by a team, he was the editor-in-chief, and the work was largely made in his image. In his defense, this was a good thing in some ways. He had a masterful touch as a wordsmith, and his Bible is widely credited as having created the foundation for a universal German dialect. It was also more approachable than most other variants of his day, which helped Biblical terms and concepts enter freely into the everyday vocabularies of the working class. But it\u2019s exactly here where another dark side presents itself. There's a reason the Catholic Church never really warmed to the the idea of printing vernacular-based translations (though they rarely outright forbade it). Perhaps surprisingly, that line of reasoning had little to do with power or control. At the heart of it, there was a widespread concern about the layman's ability to judge things for himself. The Bible is a collection of ancient, nuanced, often unclear texts. Studied in isolation by someone without proper education or contextual resources, it can inspire odd and unhealthy interpretations. History had already proven that such a phenomenon almost only ended in violence. By largely restricting the reading of the Scriptures to the clergy, the Catholic Church grounded theological discussions in forums where qualified opinions could have loudest say. There were always disagreements, but they weren\u2019t traditionally violent in medieval times.* As the proliferation of localized translations grew, schisms and violence grew in proportion (the bloodiest periods in western history came after and in response to the Reformation). Though few people would now advocate for an abolition of individual translations or private readings, it would be disingenuous to suggest that the publication of Luther\u2019s Bible was a step forward in the propagation of the Kingdom of Heaven (while there\u2019s more than sufficient evidence to lead us to the opposite conclusion). * Note: Though religious executions and forced exiles did happen in the Middle Ages, they were rare. Even during the various inquisitions, the function of the papal emissary was usually to save lives by allowing the examination of heresy claims to be conducted by a more qualified and disinterested party. Most major acts of violence in that era were inter-religious, political, or ethnically-driven. Intra-religious conflicts on a non-local scale were comparatively rare, with the significant exception of the Albigensian Crusade. #3b: The Hymnals, 1524. If I asked an English-speaking churchgoer to name a hymn written by Martin Luther, I'd expect them to answer A Mighty Fortress about 95% of the time. Few except for the most liturgical among us have ever heard of his other entries like O Lord, Look Down from Heaven. This is for good reason: most of them don't read all that well in a more enlightened world. Adapted from Psalm 12, the aforementioned hymn articulates Luther's inner state as his self-inflicted troubles encircle him. It positions him as a suffering saint, zealously defending the \"true faith\" from an \"evil generation\" set on corrupting it. It frames his struggle in teleological terms, with his enemies (i.e., anyone who disagreed with him) painted as unwitting agents of Satan. In re-reading it for the first time as an adult, I couldn\u2019t help but feel that it bore eerie resemblance to the self-consumed rhetoric of Luther's modern-day equivalents. None of its lines would seem out of place spewing from the mouths of a Pat Robertson or a Jerry Falwell (or a renegade imam under the employ of ISIS, to be honest). It was polemic of the highest order, full of affected zeal and completely devoid of self-awareness or any Christian virtue. #3c: On the Jews and Their Lies, 1543. And now we reach the nadir of our tragic tale. While some sympathetic scholars offer mild defenses for the behaviors described thus far, this is the hill where all abandon him. The ugly, undeniable truth is that Martin Luther did more to buttress and advance the cause of violent, moralized antisemitism than any other public figure in western history. In that one named treatise alone, he proposed burning their homes and synagogues, confiscating their property, putting them to hard labor as pseudo-slaves, and cleansing them from Germany via extrajudicial murder. Tragically, his suggestions to this end grew even louder and more violent over the remaining few years of his life (as he appears to have succumbed to his various illnesses). It's worth noting that twenty years earlier he had written in vehement opposition to acts of violence and aggression against the Jews. What changed in the intervening time? Well, the Jews did something unpardonable: they rejected the Gospel of Martin Luther. His Jewish conversion efforts had failed terribly, and, like a scorned prophet, Luther decided that their rejection of him was their rejection of the mercy of God. Now, it would be unfair to pin the atrocities of Auschwitz on Luther directly. Hitler and Himmler weren't necessarily inspired by him \u2014 at least, not solely. But his writings did play an important role in their evils, as they were presented to the public as moral and theological justifications for the holocaust (helped by the fact that they\u2019d never been formally disowned in the intervening 400 years). If a good Christian like Luther, a national hero no less, had recognized the \"Jewish problem\" and thought it only curable by fire, who could speak to their defense? Conclusion: This is an incomplete sketch, representative rather than exhaustive. My goal was simply to show the reader something about the stubborn power of myths, not to single Luther out as a monster. We must not hate him, but we must also learn from his example. To idolize him is to remain on the wrong side of history. The big question we\u2019re left with, of course, is how we\u2019ve gotten his story so backward for so long. Well, the simplest (if most troubling) explanation is that anti-Catholic sentiment has been so dominant for so long in many western countries that most Protestant institutions decided it was easier to perpetuate the myth than own their sins. To do otherwise was to challenge their own foundations\u200a \u2014\u200a which is something like suicide in the view of most leaders. Much easier to double down and hope no one notices. And the myth of Martin Luther, as it turns out, is just the tip of that iceberg. ",

            "answer_text": "People look at him and judge him by the values of today\u2019s secular society and find that he didn\u2019t have the virtues people respect today. And he was not politically correct by today\u2019s standards. What they should do is look at the times in which he lived. He didn\u2019t create that environment; he just reacted to it. His 95 Theses were concerns about what he felt were abuses in the Church. He actually was just inviting debate and had communicated his concerns to his bishop through accepted channels. However, his bishop ignored the communication because he was making money by selling indulgences, so he passed the communication on to Rome. Once Luther had taken his position, he didn\u2019t back down but went further in the direction he had started. His main contribution to society was his rejection of Papal infallibility and intercession by saints and priests. Once those ideas took hold, the church\u2019s central role in people\u2019s lives was doomed. The pope at the time was a Medici pope and he was quite perturbed. But politically, the Swiss and Germans were developing capitalism and wealth was moving from Florence and Rome to northern Europe. The nobles in the north found it very expedient to support this idea of leaving Rome out of religion because they would save a lot of money and their subjects would not be sending their resources to the church. So Luther came at an opportune time that found him with political support for economic reasons, not religious reasons. After WWII, the communists in East Germany gave Luther honorable mentions because they said he was one of the first true reformers who fought for the working classes. They said that he later abandoned his early revolutionary tendencies because he condemned the killing of nobles during the Peasant\u2019s Rebellion, but he still deserved notice for the revolution that he had put in place. I found that take on him very amusing - he became a communist hero! Luther\u2019s problem was that he he was still religious and believed a lot of the stories and teachings. As a result, he became increasingly dogmatic about his views and today a lot of people don\u2019t respect him because of that. But he was a product of his times. ",

            "answer_text": "Martin Luther is well known for starting the Protestant Reformation, posting his 95 Theses and his huge impact on Christianity. He translated the Bible into German. Martin Luther became a monk because of a near death experienceHis family originally intended for him to study law in order to help the family business. Luther was caught in a storm and he prayed to the mother of the Virgin Mary St. Anna to save his life, if he became a monk. He honored his promise and became a monk two years later 2. Unfortunately he held anti-Semitic views At first Luther advocated for the gentle treatment of Jews and criticized the Catholic Church for their harsh treatment of the Jews. This criticism is the primary reason why Luther saw the harsh treatment of Jews as the reason why they will never convert to Christianity. As he got older he started to have Luther started to have more aggressive view of the Jews. He claimed that Judaism is a false religion Here is what he said about the Jews \u201ca Jewish heart is as hard as a stick, a stone, as iron, as a devil.\u201d In 1543 Luther proposed seven measures to get rid of the Jews which included setting fire to their synagogues and schools.

            "answer_text": "He was wrong. Was there corruption on a massive scale in the Church? Yes. Was that in need of reform? Unquestionably. But the idea that the Church did or ought to derive its authority from the Bible is wrong. Imagine this: you\u2019re a Christian living in the year 60 A.D. There is already a Church. This Church already has a hierarchy. Where does it get its authority from? Certainly not from the Bible\u2014there is as of yet no such thing. The Gospel of Mark, the oldest gospel, hasn\u2019t yet been written. Will anyone argue that the Church as of 60 AD was illegitimate because it did not follow New Testament principles? This is utterly ridiculous. And yet, by the sola scriptura principle, this is in effect what Luther was arguing. It is the sanction of the Church that made the Bible authoritative, not the other way around. It was the authority of the Church that determined which books would be included and which would be excluded. And you don\u2019t have to be a Christian, or even a believer, to see this. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cSin boldly.\u201d I think that after 500 years Martin Luther\u2019s relaxed attitude towards sin is not what we tend to remember when we think about protestantism. He was a rebel who didn\u2019t want to have any intermediaries between God and people. He rejected all meticulous scrutiny of sins (mainly because that had been so characteristic to Luther himself before). He passionately wrote to Philip Melanchthon that sin doesn\u2019t separate us from God, no matter how many thousands of times we sinned each day: \u201cIf you are a preacher of mercy, do not preach an imaginary but the true mercy. If the mercy is true, you must therefore bear the true, not an imaginary sin. God does not save those who are only imaginary sinners. Be a sinner, and let your sins be strong (sin boldly), but let your trust in Christ be stronger, and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin, death, and the world.\u201d (From a letter to Melanchthon, the 1st of August in 1521[1] ) This should naturally not be taken as understating evil or undermining our responsibility. But if there\u2019s something about it that we should notice, it\u2019s the enormous emphasis Luther places on mercy. Whenever protestantism appears as judgemental, meticulous, moralistic or small-minded towards other people, it has distanced itself really, really far from Martin Luther. That being said, I\u2019m not a very devoted Lutheran myself. He was just one man in the long history of the Church, far from perfect, and should be seen as such. The Lutheran Church often puts him on a pedestal and cherishes an image of him that doesn\u2019t make justice even to the spirit of his own teaching. The way I see it, my Church is much more than some section of it that happened to grow apart 500 years ago.

Whenever one studies the man\u2019s life we see things that could be called both admirable and worthy of contempt. The things most worthy of contempt are things Luther wrote about Jews in a work entitled \u2018On the Jews and Their Lies\u2019. The work is extremely anti-Jewish and goes to the level of definite hate. Luther calls for the final expulsion of the Jews from Germany, or else something worse, but says- \u2018in any case, away with them!\u2019. Luther dehumanizes Jews to a high level in the work. He suggests that Jews can\u2019t even live without being parasites whenever he says following: \u2018Jews daily eat no food and wear no clothing except that which they have pilfered from us by means of their accursed usury\u2019 \u2014Martin Luther, On the Jews and Their Lies There really is no getting around here that Luther seemed to be implying Jews should be suspect just for living their lives. Just for eating and clothing themselves. Luther also made a very ugly statement about baptizing Jews, that he might have thought was a clever joke, but it was extremely hateful. I do not wish to repeat it. \u2018On the Jews and Their Lies\u2019 will forever be a very ugly stain on Luther\u2019s legacy, and he would have himself to blame. The Nazis popularly circulated the work during the WWII era, so this work of Luther helped fuel the greatest genocide in human history. Martin Luther is not the man so many of us were raised to believe he was. He was no saint. ",
