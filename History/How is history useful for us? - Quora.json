            "answer_text": "For two reasons mostly: sense and identity. There can be no identity without memory. The chain of events, places and people that make up your life is necessary to help you get a sense of self. It helps you feel the growth and changes of your being. It gives you a measuring scale to help you assess how you are. That collection of memories tells you who you are. The pervasive web of events, places and people knitted together by your memory is the very fabric of you. Life would be unbearable is you had to start from a blank page everyday. Like individuals, societies need memory to get a sense of their collective being. When that memory holds fast then events, places and people generate values, tenets and principles that foster cohesion and survival. In a society where everyone is a stockholder of that collective memory, every person shares in its delights, in its teachings, in its warnings. That tacit yet powerful fellowship among the members of a society makes life liveable for Man is but a social animal. It gives us a sense of being and belonging that both completes and transcends our identity. Having a sense of self also implies that certain acts are repugnant because they offend the idea one has of oneself. It also implies that some actions can be deemed to be good because they fundamentally resonates with what we are really about. With that compass in hand we can sail through life trying to do as much good and as little bad as possible so that at the end of our voyage we may turn back on our existence and look at it free of remorse. The same goes for society as a whole. Each and every of our collective actions take particular significance with regard to our collective identity. Its meaning reverberates through time, past and future. Our collective action can only take meaning when in relation to one another. In some circumstances, the smallest of deeds can have the deepest meaning. Therefore, what we do as a society today is not only measured against the values enshrined in our collective identity but it is also judged by what we have already accomplished, good or bad. What does electing a black president mean to a country which fought and sometimes slaughtered its own people to abolish slavery? What judgement does it elicit with regards to the values that were defended during the Civil War? What does it mean for the German people that their Chancellor visited the Yad Vashem Mausoleum of the Holocaust in Jerusalem? What does it mean to be a Scotsman and why would that justify wanting to be part of an independent country with your fellow Scotsmen? To all these questions, only History can provide and answer. ",

History helps us to know the reasons behind present status of society, polity, economy and other aspects of life. Don't consider history as a separate discipline if you do so then you will not enjoy the real fruit of history.Interlinking history with other social sciences can develop your understanding of various aspects in holistic manner. You will find yourself at hights from where you can see the past, present and future otherwise you will not able to know who you are? Why you are? And how how are?Even your citizenship has its roots in history though it is a matter of polity. That much interlinkages are there. ",
