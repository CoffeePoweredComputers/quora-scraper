            "answer_text": "Maa Durga is Mother of you, your wife and your female child. All feminine essence she denotes. She is creation. She is getting birth, sustaining and getting death. She made the creation as possible, because she dragged shiva, that\u2019s atma or Brahma, which is without form, gave him form created shiva. Otherwise shiva would have escaped to atma, he would never available for this creation. She brought purush to the creation and made this creation as possible. Otherwise no creation will be there. Hence sometimes people coin her as consort of shiva. Shiva never mixed with maa durga. They\u2019re parallel entinties. She is Mother of shiva, wife of shiva and kiiler of shiva. Again she gives birth to shiva and cycle continues. Hence she is keeping his consort under her feet. If shiva escapes, further no copulating and no creation. Hence she is Brahma or waves of Brahma. Hence she is devine mother of creation. ",
