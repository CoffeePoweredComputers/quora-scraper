            "answer_text": "Here are the different parts of your nails and how they grow:  The matrix: Each nail begins growing out of a little pocket under your skin. This is the root of the nail, and it's called the matrix. The matrix constantly makes new cells. These new cells force the old ones to get packed together and pushed up through the skin. By the time the nail pokes out of the skin (where you can see it), those cells are dead. That's why it doesn't hurt to cut your nails.The cuticle: You might have heard about other parts of the nail, such as the cuticle. This is a tiny sliver of skin where your nail grows out of your finger. It protects the root or the matrix from germs.The lunula: The small, whitish, half-moon shape that you sometime see at the bottom of your nails is called the lunula(pronounced loon-yoo-la). It's actually part of the matrix. You might be able to see it only on your thumbs, or maybe not at all. Don't worry if you can't see a lunula on any of your fingers. It's no big deal. It's there, just under your skin.   A fingernail with a healthy matrix, cuticle, and lanula.  source-https://www.aad.org/dermatology-a-to-z/for-kids/about-nails/how-nails-grow ",
