            "answer_text": "Is age 39 considered middle aged? A2A, Evan. At age 39, I was deep into my career (13 years of seniority at my job), had a wife, two step kids (one of which, my step son, I was teaching to drive), and a Kindergartener. I was a far cry from my so-called \u201cYouth\u201d (my son was now entering into that time of life). I am now a not-quite empty nester, contemplating potential early retirement in four years. My youngest is now deep into her college baccalaureate degree (with to date a perfect 4.0 average). My middle daughter has a husband, a tweenaged step-son and a kindergartner son, and is learning to be a LPN. My son owns his own home, and has a good career. And I don\u2019t quite feel like I\u2019m out of middle age, though I realize I\u2019m moving up the ranks in that. Oh, yes, I\u2019m definitely no longer \u201cYoung\u201d. I\u2019ve even been known to break out, ironically, with phrases like \u201cIn my day\u2026\u201d and \u201cYou whippersnapper\u2026\u201d and \u201cGet off my lawn!\u201d, but those are normally said with either a smirk of sarcasm or in direct response to someone mentioning my greying temples. But I\u2019m not yet old. My mental image of my parents is set; while they both made it into their 70s (my father made it to 80, a miracle of modern medical science set for a different answer!), my mental image of them is younger. My father? About 42\u201345 is where I typically see him, when I bring up the generic \u201cDad\u201d image in my head. My mom? She\u2019s a vivacious 34\u201337 year old beauty when I think \u201cMom\u201d in my head. I have no trouble seeing my parents in their later years, when I think of them and think \u201c2010\u201d, for example (they both passed in 2016, as I\u2019ve mentioned in my answers in the past, especially where I answered whether or not you can die of a broken heart\u2026. spoiler, that\u2019s what my dad passed away from). But the images that are \u201cgeneric\u201d are from my teenage and slightly younger days. I even remember them from earlier, of course. And while I look at those and say \u201cWell, they were old when I was 7 or 8\u201d, I also know that\u2019s not true. They were in their prime (in fact, my father was by far his healthiest in his life from age 30 until about age 60). My father was middle aged until ~60\u201365. Only then did he start to be \u201cold\u201d, and only marginally so until he was closer to 70. My mother, his opposite in health most of her life, became less healthy as she got older, after she developed Lupus, and later cancer, in her very late 40s and early 50s. So is 39 \u201cMiddle Aged\u201d? Probably, by some ways of thinking. It\u2019s out of the first rush of young mental adulthood in the late 20s and early 30s. It\u2019s a time where your thoughts and goals stop being about yourself and your short term needs, and after when most people have begun concentrating on family, relationships, and long term goals; it\u2019s also typically after at least some of those long term goals have begun coming to fruition. But it\u2019s not \u201cold\u201d. At 39, I was not as fast or strong as I had been at 21, for example, I\u2019d put on some weight and lost some hair (ok, a lot of hair\u2026.), but I was still easily able to do things without aches and pains, with strain, that required exertion. At my current age, I\u2019m still able to do most of those \u201cheavy lifting\u201d, \u201chard work\u201d things\u2026 but now, sometimes, I need an Advil or such afterwards, or Icy Hot, or Bengay to ease some of the stiffness. This is probably late middle-aged for me, as it\u2019s only \u201csometimes\u201d (not even \u201cmost of the time\u201d). So, at 39, know that their isn\u2019t anything to really worry about, yet. Yes, you\u2019re now middle aged, congratulations. But you\u2019re still young enough to enjoy EVERYTHING life has to offer. Enjoy it, work towards those long term goals, and experience the wonderful ride of life. ",

            "answer_text": "Here I am, at 83, enjoying what my (departed, but treasured) friend Isaac Asimov called \u201cAdvanced Youth\u201d. Oh yes, I am displaying and enduring some of the infirmities and inadequacies which result from having used up many of my earlier capacities and competences, but still experiencing enthusiasms and enjoying new adventures. Discovering new worlds all the time. Middle age arrives when one stops finding new adventures and exploring unfamiliar territories \u2014 and merely repeats previous pleasures and experiences, or at most becomes a spectator when exposed to something new or different. Old age arrives when one\u2019s range of experiences and activities begins to narrow, so that life becomes just repetitions of a steadily declining set of things one does or enjoys. That has nothing to do with chronological age. It is a function of the person. For me, the narrowest times of my life occurred before age 39. By far the most exciting and enjoyable new adventures \u2014 as well as my worst and most devastating experiences \u2014 have occurred after the age of 40. For many people, that is not true. There are some people for whom getting out of high school was the culmination of their youth. They soon got married, got a job, bought a house, and have not done anything significantly different ever after. For a good share of that group, old age set it around age 45, when their kids were a grown and gone, and every year thereafter has involved just doing over what they did before, but maybe with a new toy every so often. Some people have found that their lives broadened, with new adventures, every year after they left high school. That\u2019s what it was for me, except that the number and variety of new adventures increased more rapidly after I reached 40, than it did after I had passed 20. Apparently you are close to the threshold of 40. I hope you too will find an increasing range of new interests, activities, ventures, personalities, and explorations in the years to come. The next 40 years, at least. That\u2019s what we (Isaac and me and numerous others) mean by Advanced Youth. We all hope that you find yourself entering Advanced Youth, lasting for decades pst your 40th birthday. ",
