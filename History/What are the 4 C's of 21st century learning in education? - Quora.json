            "answer_text": "Google it. It will be displayed in first page only. I googled it for you: What Are the 4 C's of 21st Century Skills? But, if you are a teacher or would be teacher, I advise you to find your own meaning for these 4C\u2019s. Like my meanings are: Critical Thinking: You URGENTLY need the solution to a problem, you solve it. And how you will create urgency for students? Simple, by making the problem interesting and useful. So, next time, don\u2019t just pose the problem, but pose an interesting problem. Creativity: As the problem is interesting and useful now, how to solve it? Your student wants to do it at any cost. They will think individually and then discuss the solutions in group and will find the best solutions to the problem Collaboration: You see, what they have done? They use their creativity and found solutions together, that is collaboration. Communication: Now, students have solutions but how to share it? For some, language is hurdle. For some, YOU are the hurdle (you are strict teacher!) For some, doubtfulness is hurdle. For some, blah blah blah is hurdle. Here, comes your major role, create an atmosphere, where they can confidently communicate their ideas. Welcome their ideas and provide tools for communication. So, dear friend 4C\u2019s are easy to remember but difficult to implement. All the best for applying them in your teaching. ",
