            "answer_text": "DISCLAIMER: This answer is purely opinion. This will all consist of my opinion of computer brands. Thus, if you do not agree with me, I implore you, please don\u2019t give me hate in the comments. ACER. Hands down, it\u2019s Acer. Not Asus, mind you, ACER. they have kind of built something around cheap computers, like, REALLY cheap computers. there\u2019s one problem though. You can only get so cheap before cheap turns into flimsy. Take for example, the original Acer C720 Chromebook. I own two. Don't ask why. Anyway, they both had the flimsiest screens in the world. Note the careful use of the word had. That is intentional. One broke while I was using it in a beanbag chair. You heard me right, a BEANBAG CHAIR. It slid off my lap when I stood up, fell about a foot to the ground, and had its screen absolutely demolished. It\u2019s brother suffered a similar fate, except it was from slightly higher up. I replaced the screen in one of them. (which cost about a third of the cost of the actual computer, I know, I should have seen the bad deal. I was young and innocent at the time, OK?) The new screen broke when it was closed too hard, yeah. It was closed \u201ctoo hard\u201d and the screen broke. Talk about poor craftsmanship. anyway, they have mostly been sitting dormant, one actually got a much more durable \u201cscreen\u201d when I plugged it into my TV. the other just acts as a stand for its brother. TL,DR: Acer. Enough said. Afterthought: My current laptop is a much sturdier 13\u2033 retina MacBookPro. (2015) it hasn't broken yet. Edit: Fixed some glaringly obvious grammar errors that were starting me in the face that I didn\u2019t notice. ",
