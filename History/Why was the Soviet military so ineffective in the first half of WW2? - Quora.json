            "answer_text": "It wasn\u2019t. Performance is relative. An attacker needs to achieve total victory to win, but a defender only needs to avoid total defeat. It was attacked by a Treaty Ally and wasn\u2019t prepared for the attack. The attacker held the advantages of knowing when and where the attack would take place and being prepared, but despite these advantages it didn\u2019t defeat the Soviets. That, to use a double negative, is not an ineffective defense. The Soviets didn\u2019t need to win anything to succeed, they needed to not lose everything; and in late 1941 at their moment of greatest weakness, when they had faced down the enemy at their greatest strength, they didn\u2019t. Thereafter their enemy would never again be so strong and they would never again be so weak. Did they make tactical mistakes; yes. All the Allies did in the initial onslaughts. They lost some truly epic battles, which are badly overlooked, but these did have a strategic role of both delaying and degrading their enemy, which they did. They were trading huge numbers of men and materiel to degrade and delay the enemy at enormous tactical cost, but with considerable strategic sense. Could they have done better? Yes. Could they have done worse? Much. They didn\u2019t lose, their trade of resources to delay and degrade the enemy worked. That\u2019s not ineffective. ",

            "answer_text": "It was playing the evade and catch up game: Post communist purges and limited financial support hindered the military. Stalin hedged his bets on the Nazi/ Soviet non aggression pact as protecting the Rodina against attack. Review operation Barbarossa. Russian industry and population in retreat. Moving East with material, service & support provided the breathing space; the Rodina is a vast, vast country, with limited infrastructure. Useful to Review a map of Asia. Even today a lot of rural Russia is navigated by large rivers/ waterways. A train ride across the country, St Petersburg to Magadan can take a week or longer. Watch episode 7 of Ewan MacGregors \u201cThe long way round\u201d to understand the true nature of the countries terrain - imagine a German Army invading Russia and consider that not all units were tracked/ mechanized. There was a lot of horses and wagon wheeled vehicles used by the infantry. Once caught up with new weapons and service personnel ( women soldiers too, v effective). The Germans were running out of steam and winter was the greatest Ally. Now with lots of tanks, artillery guns and soldiers the vastly overstretched German Army was now on its back foot and in for the fight of its life. In summary: Rethink ineffective: The key cities never fell. Stalingrad and Moscow continued to withhold capitulation. Consider perhaps that a retreat to fight another day when the terms were more in the attackers favour. There\u2019s a lot of good resources, books and online, out there. An active reader and researcher can self discover a lot on this subject and complement my basic comments - Good luck. ",
