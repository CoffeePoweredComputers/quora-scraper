            "answer_text": "It is easier to name the similarities. Even at the face of it, considering the huge disparity of size --- Japan is mountainous and in land area about the size of California, whereas Europe has a variety of terrains and climates and is about the size of the lower 48 states --- there is going to be a huge cultural disparity. Japan had feudalism and elite military forces of a kind, but the shogun was not a baron and samurai were not knights.  Probably the biggest difference that comes to mind is that Europe had meaningful disagreements between spheres of the Church and State, a dichotomy which existed in Europe but not in Japan. In Japan, and the East in general, and ancient civilizations all over the world, civil authorities simply are the organs of religion.  In Europe, kings and barons and landowners may have had control over you, but they were not gods and often not even particularly religious. On the part of civil leaders, there was a great amount of jealousy towards those religious bodies which did have secular authority in medieval Europe, from the Pope himself down to the meanest Abbot. Investiture controversies were so common a flaw of medieval Europe they might as well have been a feature. ",
