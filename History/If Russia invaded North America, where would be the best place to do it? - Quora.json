            "answer_text": "\u201cLet's say Russia, which in this scenario let's assume has a powerful blue water navy, is fighting NATO in Europe and invades America or Canada a-la-world-in-conflict.\u201d The only way Russia could get to the US is either by sneaking passed the US and allied navies, by defeating them, or by going straight over the North Pole through Canada. In order to invade the western US and Canada, with the exception of Alaska, Russia would have to eliminate the US United States Third Fleet, United States Seventh Fleet, and likely the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and Republic of Korea Navy. At the moment the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force has more destroyers, AWSs, and carriers than the Russian Navy (counting Japan\u2019s so-called \u201cflat-deck destroyers\u201d as carriers)\u2026 List of countries by level of military equipment In order to invade the Eastern US and Canada, the Russia would have to take out the US United States Fourth Fleet, United States Tenth Fleet, and United States Sixth Fleet, as well as the Royal Navy and French Navy. Even if Russia had a powerful blue water navy with significant air power, they would need to win dozens of battles to get to the US on either side. Japan had a very powerful blue water navy in the 1930s and 1940s, and they could not reach the continental US because they lost battles. The only target on the edges of the US that could theoretically cripple the US is the East Coast.   I do not honestly think taking the East Coast actually would cripple the US, but it is a starting point. Killing, depopulating, or capturing most of the densely populated areas between Boston and Northern Virginia would be a serious blow. Even with a blue water navy however, because of the difficulties I pointed out, Russia would have to take areas, like southern England, that were even more densely populated than the eastern US to get that far. England has not really* been successfully invaded since 1066. The Gulf Coast could also be a good target, but it would mostly just hurt the US\u2019s oil, which would not matter in this scenario because oil would already be reserved for wartime production. This leaves just the Western US\u2026 The problem with that is the western US is less populous, has very little economically valuable outside of the areas of LA-San Diego, Seattle-Portland, and San Francisco, and once you took any of those areas you would be bottled up. Between LA-San Diego and Las Vegas are vast deserts, one of which is Death Valley, the hottest place on earth which is where I took my profile pic at around 10 am. All of the lectures I have gotten on Quora from Russophiles about how Russian troops are mythical in the snow lead me to believe that would be a very un-optimal invasion route. Anywhere really north of the LA-San Diego area would drop Russian troops to the west of tall mountains.  Now people think Switzerland is hard to invade because of that\u2026 Imagine all the bottlenecks, at every pass\u2026  This really just leaves Alaska, or else a North Pole crossing. If Russia tried a North Pole crossing, they would have to travel a least a few hundred miles with no roads.  That could take months. The entire time they would be bombed by the US and Canadian air forces. Northern Canada and Alaska just as harsh of winters as Siberia. The soldiers stationed there who would be fighting Russians are just as experienced with the cold. So\u2026 I think Alaska or over the North Pole would have a low chance of success, but unlike the other points, would not require winning World War III to get there in the first place. The question is then.. why would Russia even want to invade the US, except for twisted revenge reasons? Russia already is the most resource-rich country on earth, and largest, and still fails to produce an economy the size of the US state of California\u2019s. I don\u2019t think having more land would help Russia. *The Dutch sort of invaded successfully in 1688, but they had the support of local nobles and most of the local population.

            "answer_text": "A preposterous notion with no basis in fact. Russia has NEVER had a navy capability anywhere close to this magnitude at any time in its history. Neither does it own port facilities to do anything of this nature. *********************** That being said, back in the 70s there was actually a published wargame by James Dunnigan called \u2018Invasion America\u2019. Dunnigan later went on to be one of the foremost authors and military-political analysts for the Pentagon. Invasion America | Board Game | BoardGameGeek As an avid wargamer back then, I had to buy a copy. I still have it on a shelf somewhere, though it\u2019s been a few years since I played it. Essentially there were three \u2018powers\u2019 involved - the Pan Asiatic League (PAL), the South American Union (SAU) and the European Socialist Coalition (ESC) which meant that the West Coast, Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard were all targets of one or two powers. The three coasts all had limitations. In the West, once you established control of the major coastal cities, there was little else to do. The shear size of the Western theater meant that unless you took everything west of the Rockies, you were vulnerable to counterattacks by the US and Canadians. But if they simply left you alone, you were trying to secure essentially vast stretches of territory with no strategic value. The Gulf coast suffered from very limited port facilities (in the game anyway) and again, once the coast was taken, you just had vast areas to take with no relative value. The East coast south of the Chesapeake was virtually the same. Only the Northeast and Ohio Valley provided rapid return on territory in both industrial power and population (expressed as Victory Points in the game). However, this was extremely restricted terrain that heavily favored the defenders. In any case, the game was very bloody in terms of losses and extremely challenging for the invaders, especially since the four-player game usually devolved into in-fighting between invading nations, giving the US-Canadian player more than enough chances to eke out a minor victory as the respective invasions all stalled.
