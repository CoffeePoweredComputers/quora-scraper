            "answer_text": "The sweet potato does not grow underground. It is a member of the Morning Glory family and therefore technically a creeper, who sends its flowering parts in long trails over the ground. What is eaten are the underground tubers of the plant, that are dug up like potatoes, hence the name sweet potato. When growing new sweet potatoes you treat them like potatoes by cutting up the tubers into pieces and dig them into the soil, waiting for new shoots to sprout. In certain countries young shoots are also eaten. ",
