            "answer_text": "According to Zhuangzi\u5e84\u5b50,  written before BC -221, Zhao Huiwen King\u8d75\u60e0\u6587\u738b, -308-BC-226) likes sword worriors very much.  He has 3k sword worriors dueling day and night for 3 years. Each year the death and injured men of them is over 100. The prince says who can stop that can get 1k \u91d1(complex to tell the unit, it's very much)  from me. Zhuangzi\u5e84\u5b50 whose name is Zhuang Zhou\u5e84\u5468 (zi is like Sir or Saint) tells Zhao Huiwen King that he is good at swords.  ZHK is excited to ask Zhuang: How good are you? Zhuang: I can kill any one within 10 steps and leave far away. ZHK zealot: You are invincible!  Zhuang: I can duel to show that. ZHK spends 7 days to select some sword worriors to duel with Zhuang and the casualty is 50-60.  Zhuang: I have 3 sowrds which only king can use it. Please let me state them before the duel. ZHK: Please say it. Zhuang: They are Sword of Tianzi\u5929\u5b50 (son of heaven/sky), Sowrd of Zhuhou\u8bf8\u4faf(vassals of Tianzi) and Sword of Plebians. ZHK: What is Sword of Tianzi? Zhuang: Sword of Tianzi,  Mount Stone\u77f3\u57ce as Blade,  Qi (Kingdom, Shandong Province)  and Dai (Mount Tai) as \u9537 (handguard of a sword),  Jin Wei (Wei Kingdom belonged to Jin kingdom) as \u810a (spine of a sword) Zhou (Chou)  and Song as \u9561 (the end of a sword) Han and Wei as \u5939 (container of a sword) Covered with 4 babarians and 4 seasons Surronded with the Bohai Sea and Mount Chang .... ... .... ZHK: What is Sowrd of Plebians? Zhuang: bad manner+fight for nothing good for the country. ZHK hands Zhuang's hand to enter the palace to show respects. Zhuang: I state over. Now I can duel for you. 3 months ZHK discussing with Zhuang and do not leave the palace. the sword worriors all commit suicide.  It is real. At that time, the sense of morality is in everyone's heart. When Qi kingdom dies, 500 worrior commit suicide, too.  So China had like Gladiator games in ancient time, but soon it was abolished.  What Zhuang says is to tell a king how to unify the world with strategies and how to make people harmony.  In Ancient China, there are several games: 1. cock fighting games 2. shoot arrows with hands into a pot 3. polo 4.golf-yes it is. And there is a golf bible to tell people how to be a good player. Written in Yuan Dynasty. 5. Cuju. playing with a ball with feet. Rules are different.   ",

            "answer_text": "In China there was neither bread nor circuses. The local town officials might organize for a group of touring players to put on a play or opera. Traveling acrobats, magicians, martial artists etc might gather knowing a festival is on. But sports were never part of China's culture as say horsemanship was for Mongolians who have an annual equine games called Nadam. ",
