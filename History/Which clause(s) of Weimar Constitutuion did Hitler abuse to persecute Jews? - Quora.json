            "answer_text": "The Enabling Act of 1933 - Wikipedia gave Hitler all the power he needed. It allowed the government to pass laws without the control of the parliament. Those laws could deviate from the constitution. As long as the parliament was not officially abolished there weren\u2019t any limits. I\u2019m not sure what you mean by abusing clauses to persecute Jews. Hitler didn\u2019t use the constitution to persecute Jews. He simply ignored the constitution and did what he wanted. ",
