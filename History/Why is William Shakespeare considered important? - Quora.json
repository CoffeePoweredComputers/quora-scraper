            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a man who kills his best friend so that he can run the show, all the while being pushed to do more and more to protect himself in his quest to hang onto power. Is that relevant today? There are two kids who are madly in love, but their families hate one another for some reason, no one\u2019s sure what, and yet, they get together, get married and try to make their relationship work despite the odds. Is that relevant today? A guy is sure that his stepfather did something wrong to become his stepfather and begins to challenge the man who has taken his father\u2019s place. He\u2019s a bit mad, a bit sad, but definitely unwilling to let go of this obsession. Is that relevant today? It\u2019s easy to dismiss Shakespeare because the language is tough to get through and no one talks like that these days. Yet, the stories are stories of the human condition that ask us to focus on what people do and how they react and somehow we discover that people haven\u2019t really changed that much. In my experiences teaching Shakespeare over the years, if students are given half a chance, they can understand and appreciate the stories that the bard tells. And they can comprehend and find the beauty and the humor in his plays and in his poetry. People are still trying to tear down leaders because they are jealous, parents are willing to do just about anything to protect their children, lovers will try to find the perfect match, men will find themselves awash in bitterness and seek revenge, women will rail against becoming property rather than mistresses of their own fate. Love will still find us seeing all the imperfections in a lover\u2019s face, yet loving the person despite all those flaws. Shakespeare endures because he understood the flaws of men and women and used them to tell stories that are still relevant today. ",

            "answer_text": "We know that in Shakespeare\u2019s time an enormous number of plays were produced. Theatre was hugely popular and lucrative, the Globe (holding 3000 people) was far from being the only purpose built playhouse and there were numerous other venues used for theatrical performances. Add to this the fact that the population of London at the time was approx 200,000 we can see why performance runs were so short and why there was a massive demand for new plays. There is lots of really interesting research on the process by which plays came about, but an important fact is that, unlike the sonnet cycles that were also fashionable at the time, they were written for performance and not for publication. They were ephemera. So Shakespeare would not have been considered as important as he is today if were it not for John Heminges and Henry Condell. Heminges and Condell who did something unusual at the time, which was to collect, record, edit and publish the majority of Shakespeare\u2019s plays. Thanks to them, Shakespeare\u2019s play writing was preserved and has seeped indelibly into our language over the last 400 years (Google - Things We Say Today & Owe To Shakespeare). Even an unfamiliar Shakespeare play is easier for a modern reader to enjoy reading than one by Marlow or Jonson (try this for yourself). Another point that I believe has worked in Shakespeare\u2019s favour is that we know very little about the man at all, not even the exact date that he was born. This makes Shakespeare an enduring subject of academic speculation; a delicious enigma for us to decode through a close study of the work. All the controversy about the authorship of the plays and the identities of the subjects of the sonnets are enormous fun and help keep Shakespeare in the news. The last point of course, and one already made by others, is that he was a good writer, very, very, very good. ",
