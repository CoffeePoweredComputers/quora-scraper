            "answer_text": "This is a really interesting thought experiment to me. I\u2019m going to expand a bit on the question before answering: How would things be different if France had not sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States and it was still part of France today? OK - first the part that directly answers the original question: I think France might be a lesser country than it is today. Managing their own European presence, plus territories on another continent didn\u2019t work too well for it with Vietnam or a few other places. In fact, I agree with another person who answered that the Louisiana Territory would most likely have become a part of the United States anyway \u2014 either peacefully or by force. But let\u2019s assume it didn\u2019t, and France just kept it on life support. New Orleans would probably be a better place, with less crime and probably more tourism. St. Louis would not only be the gateway to the west, but a vital and vibrant trading hub between the US and France (and probably the Spanish territories to the west \u2014 more about that in a minute). St. Louis would probably be a lot bigger than Chicago is today, and Memphis would be a much smaller town (in the United States). North and west of St. Louis would probably be less populated than it is now, all the way up to the Canada and Oregon borders. Of course, the United States would be much smaller. Not getting the Louisiana Territory would probably have meant no westward expansion past the Mississippi River, which would have given Spain (or maybe Mexico) the opportunity to expand northward. This would mean the US never became the super power it is today, leaving Russia and China to be the major players. Which could have meant an opportunity to expand well beyond their current borders. It is not inconceivable that Russia would have expanded throughout Europe, Britain would have taken over Canada, and China may have even taken over what is now the Western United States. Of course, there is a lot of speculation there. But when you think about it, the United States as it exists today is really more about balancing power throughout the world than it is about taking it. Without the United States expanding to assume the land it has today, who knows what might have happened? ",

            "answer_text": "France had a hard time developing it\u2019s distant colonies from the 1600\u2019s-1900\u2019s so Louisiana would have likely remained very sparsely populated by Frenchmen with either a good working relationship with the hundreds of tribes (that had already been fracturing since the loss of French Canada and West of the Appalachians in the 1750\u2019s-1760\u2019s, 40 years before the Louisiana Purchase) or try to enslave them for plantation, logging, and mining work like the Spaniards to the West of them had. If Napoleon hadn\u2019t lost an entire French Army destined for New Orleans to put the Louisiana Purchase fully under French control (stopping to put down a slave rebellion in French Haiti instead eliminated that Army with disease), it probably would have stayed French territory (albeit it had until quite recently been Spanish territory until Napoleon conquered Spain.) Whether the U.S. would have fought France for that territory at some point seems nearly certain, like the wars with Mexico (Texas Independence, filibustering expeditions, the 1846 war, California independence, filibustering expeditions under the Knights of the Golden Circle, up through the 1916 invasions, or with Canada (Cold War 1783\u20131811, War of 1812, struggle for the Pacific Northwest boundary, Confederate raids on St. Albans VT and Detroit from Canada, etc.). Otherwise the U.S.\u2019s Western border would have been the Appalachian Mountains and Old Northwest Territory so about a third of it\u2019s modern size. Assuming France managed to fully exploit the Louisiana Purchase, growing it\u2019s capital New Orleans as well as Baton Rouge, St. Louis, Memphis, Kansas City, Des Moines, Dubuque, Des Plaines, Chicago, Omaha, Sioux Falls, Red River Valley, etc. it would have had the raw materials for a bigger French Navy and far more Atlantic sea trade, room for literally every French family to move there, vast farmland and pasturage like the Russians\u2019 Ukraine, navigable rivers, lots of coal, iron ore, lead, copper, sulphur, petroleum, hydropower sites, some silver and gold, meat, leather, building stone, fine clays, furs, etc. to fuel French manufacturing and value-added exports like it\u2019s very rewarding sugar cane colonies. But to fully exploit it, that\u2019d have taken probably a quarter of France\u2019s population to move there over 50\u2013100 years, like the Irish and Italians did but few others. ",
