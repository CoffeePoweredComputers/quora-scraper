            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a hot summer day and you are working on your field to yield crops when all of a sudden, a group of random strange men with powerful weapons come and seize you and some of your people forcibly. You are then led to a ship, an unknown contraption, handcuffed by shackles, and constantly shoved with their weapons. You are imprisoned in the bottom of the boat without much food, sunlight and medicine when you\u2019re sick. After weeks of traveling the seas to strange territory, you finally arrive. Out of 50 captives, 30 are a lot. 15 bodies have been tossed into the ocean. 5 have been rotting in the back of the bottom of the ship. They drag you out and sell you off to a man. After that, all you remember is that you are now working on some other person\u2019s field, day in and day out, while barely getting enough food to survive. You realize now. You are a slave. This situation describes the African people\u2019s enslavement in the United States during the 1800s. Africans were forcibly taken from Africa, their native land, to work in a foreign land belonging to another person. Every day it\u2019s the same pattern; you don\u2019t get to rest. You are hurt and dying? Disposable. It\u2019s not only the Africans that have suffered in the hands of an American. But the Chinese Americans have literally built America. With their hard labor they built railroads, buildings, and many bridges you see now. They were massacred while working with no remorse from their employers. Slavery is still happening now. Girls as young as 5 are being sold into slavery for sexual pleasures of predators desiring young flesh. They are working their underdeveloped bodies tirelessly to satisfy the men that have held their lives captive. They are shamed as they live out their lives; called harsh names, despite having no choice. This is slavery. ",
