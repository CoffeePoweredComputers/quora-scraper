            "answer_text": "In soviet system, they record mean deviation of rounds that hit the target from aiming point. The data below represents what I was able to find about this. Mean deviation from aiming point for various guns. All are for 1000 meters range: D-25 (IS-2) vertically 170 mm, horizontally - 270 mm  F-34 (T-34\u201376) 300 mm vertically and 300 mm horizontally  ML-20S: 330 mm vertically by 220 mm horizontally  122 mm model 1938 howitzer (M-30): vertical 500 mm horizontal 600 mm  45 mm model 1942 (1932 and 1937 has same accuracy): vertical 500 mm horizontal 600 mm  British 40 mm 2-pounder: horizontal 200 mm vertical 400 mm  75 mm M2 (M3 Lee): vertical 300 mm horizontal 300 mm  37 mm M5 (M3 Lee): vertical 400 mm horizontal 400 mm  3.7 cm PaK (PzIII): vertical 500mm and horizontal 500mm:  88mm KwK (Tiger II) 43 260 mm vertically and 210 horizontally.  sFH18 105 (Dicker max): 400mm by 200 mm  Note the famous 88mm - it\u2019s accuracy is same as D-25T. The myth that this gun had some magical accuracy is well just a myth. The other thing is that the gunners behind this gun were experienced and skilled ones, so they were faster and better at their job. Soviets for example met experienced gunners with France and Poland experience in their stash. This however was not the case anymore in the second half of war. ",

In Sicily and Italy many M4 users\u2019 gun experienced rapid bore wear so were issued extra rounds (took more shots to hit the target) while replacement barrels were shipped over from the States. ",
