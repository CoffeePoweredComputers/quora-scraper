            "answer_text": "This is a fascinating question. My observation on point is that the real quandry is why it started to flourish in Ionia, that part of the ancient Greek world that existed along the coast of Asia Minor from Aeolia to the Maeander River. Once we posit the flourishing of philosophy here, it is easy enough to see why it would migrate amongst a bustling trading people over to Athens and Elea and other places. But why did it get such a fine start in Ionia? Well, one might start with the randomness hypothesis. Some stuff just happens. If a number of extraordinary people like Thales and Anaximenes are born in geographical and chronological proximity to each other, then extraordinary sparks will fly. Another point I\u2019ve already mentioned: a bustling trading people. The Ionians were on the edge of a continent, near the narrow passageways that led to the Black Sea and the interior, and they made a living NOT for the most part by raising crops or livestock but by moving product around. They did so, quite successfully. This is a situation that has often led to enormous creativity, though the form of the creativity changes from one instance to another. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the question. I have thought about it myself and I believe that the following factors were important: Slave system. Manual labour was done by slaves, which allowed slave owners time to socialise and exchange ideas. In some ways freeing time had the same effect as that of the automation of work that we have today.Good weather. No ice ages and good crops meant that it was possible for people to both farm the land and not die from illnesses. And be relatively wealthy. We know that a plague during the Peloponnesian War was devastating for Athens and it is argued that there was a draught during Roman times. These things did not happen during the Golden Age.Relative economic and social equality. No massive gaps between free men meant that they all claimed the right to take decisions and speak freely. This has to do with the ancient history of the tribes that made up Athens and legislation passed on just before the Golden Age.4. Cultural elements that had the seeds for individualism. Heroes had to be remembered in glory for their actions. Tragedy had to do with challenging rules. Gods were no different from humans. The Greek mythology and the Greek education later on are all about thinking for yourself. Philosophy flourished in Athens, but the seven wise men of antiquity were from all over the Hellenic area. I don't know who or when did it, but at some point of history there was a Greek person who said : \u201cYeah, right, I don't believe you, I'm going to think for myself and prove that I am correct through arguments and experiments.\u201d That's the starting point of the Greek spirit and one big part of the very essence of the Western civilisation. Addition: Athens in the 5th century BC had won many wars and had great wealth from its colonies. It was a magnet for ambitious people and for people who wanted higher education. Like the universities of the UK and the US today. And another factor (5) is geography. The Aegean sea enabled travels with the a of that time and connections with various civilisations. Greeks had been educated in Egypt, fought in Troy and regurarly traded goods with people from Asia, the Arabic peninsula and Africa. Athens during Plato\u2019s era had become the centre of all developments. In a few words: a little bit of sun, a little bit of sea and a little bit of wine helped a lot. ",
