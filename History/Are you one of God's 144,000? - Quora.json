            "answer_text": "I know that the Watchtower and Tract Society is wrong because it doesn\u2019t teach the same as the majority of true Christianity. But I also base my answer on who the WTS says Jesus is and that the WTS teaches that Jesus wasn\u2019t resurrected with a body, the way true Christianity says. When I read the Chapter in Revelation I see that 12,000 from each tribe is sealed. Now, as I understand the book of Revelation, it\u2019s filled with symbolic language. How can someone put symbolic language to the words but when it comes to the numbers they consider them literal? When I see the words, I see that the tribes of Israel are being sealed. These are the people whom God sent His Son to. But, I am part of the Gentile group. Jesus at the end of His earthly ministry told His disciples to make disciples of all the world, to us Gentiles. As a Gentile, I can become a Christian, get saved in the name of Jesus and make Him my Lord, as I already have. I can go to heaven. Now, the 144,000 is 12,000 X 12 and there were 12 tribes. Since I am not Jewish, I am not part of the 144,000. But I am still saved. How do I know this? If we were to take both numbers and words literally, the following verse of the Chapter that speaks about the 144,000 says, \u201cAfter this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands.\u201d I bolded two words that signify time after the 144,000 were sealed John looked and there was a great multitude, that none can number. We know this cannot be the 144,000 because the verse says, \u201c a great multitude that no one could count,\u201d and the previous verses literally just counted 144,000 from each tribe. So, the \u201cgreat multitude that no one could count\u201d must be greater than 144,000 but so much that no one can count. I know that scripture is talking about me, I\u2019m in that great multitude somewhere standing before the throne and before the Lamb. I will be wearing a white robe and holding two palm branches one in each hand. Revelation 7:9 (NIV) After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's, first of all, set something straight. Who are the 144,000?Although Revelation 7:4 tells us that the 144,000 are the only ones sealed, we should note that they are not the only ones who will attain salvation. Instead, as Revelation 14:4 describes, they are \u2018the firstfruits of the redeemed.\u2019 Now, this of course means that a much larger number of people will be redeemed after them.\u2014Revelation 7:9, 10. The 144,000 are those who come \u201cfrom the earth\u201d so as to stand with Christ on heavenly mount Zion, from where they will rule as kings over the earth.\u2014Revelation 14:1, 3; see Hebrews 12:22, 28. And just as the kings of ancient Israel were called Jehovah's anointed, so also those who have been called to become part of the 144,000 are Jehovah's anointed.\u20142 Kings 9:3; 2 Corinthians 1:21. One becomes a part of the 144,000 only after he has been irrevocably sealed in his forehead, identified as a conqueror\u2014trained, tested, and trusted to shoulder the weighty responsibilities to which he was called. (1 Peter 5:10; see 2 Timothy 4:7, 8) Where do they come from?The 144,000 are described, at Revelation 14:1, as having Jesus\u2019 name and Jehovah's written on their foreheads, showing that they all \u201cstem from one.\u201d\u2014Hebrews 2:11. Ephesians 4:4, 5 agrees that the entire members of the body of those called to this hope stem from \u201cone faith.\u201d So they are not found among Christendom's many denominations, for each denomination has been shown to have it\u2019s own faith, or doctrines, an overlooking of 1 Corinthians 1:10. Now, these ones who have Jehovah's name boldly inscribed on their foreheads evidently stem from those who proudly identify themselves as \u201ca people for His name,\u201d as \u201cwitnesses of God.\u201d\u2014Acts 15:14; 1 Corinthians 15:15. Jehovah has been calling his faithful Witnesses to be part of the 144,000 ever since the new covenant went into effect at Pentecost 33 C.E. Jesus\u2019 faithful apostles were the first ones called, along with over 100 others when they were anointed with holy spirit.\u2014Acts 1:5, 15. However, the scriptures show that only a \u201cremnant\u201d of these called ones will be on the earth at this time of the end, showing that although the calling hasn't ended, yet there is a limited need to administrators in God's heavenly Kingdom. (Revelation 12:17; KJV) And for this reason, the time of the end is the season for God to gather, through the good news, those who will live forever on the earth under the rulership of Jesus and the 144,000.\u2014Revelation 7:9, 14; 21:4, 5.  Now, to answer your question, because it's hard to talk about being part of a select few without coming across as vain and/or arousing unseemly feelings in others, even Jehovah's anointed ones in ancient times, including Jesus, took care not to openly disclose this information.\u20141 Samuel 10:1, 16; 2 Kings 9:6, 11; Matthew 16:20; John 10:24. For this reason, it isn't very likely that the Lord's anointed will openly identify themselves on a public forum such as this. However, know this one thing: The remaining ones of those called to be part of this specially blessed group are living and dwelling among us today, and once \u201cthe number [is] filled,\u201d the great tribulation will break forth.\u2014Revelation 6:10, 11.

            "answer_text": "No, Justin, I am not one of the 144,000 chosen to be in heaven with Christ who will co-rule over the earth for a thousand years. (Revelation 5:9,10; 14:1,3; 20:6). I am one of the great crowd who John also saw but whom he said \u201cno man was able to number.\u201d (Revelation 7:9,10) I am happy to belong to the great crowd who will inherit the earth. Somehow, on some level, when I was young I knew that I really did not want to leave the earth. Like everyone in my church I chose heaven over hell. But when I came to an understanding that there was no hell, a place of fiery torment where God torture people after they die, I wanted to live on earth forever. I became very aware of my love for life on earth a few years before I learned about the earthly paradise. I was a very young teacher then. I was teaching poetry. The poem- \u201cAn old woman thinks about the hereafter.\u201d In this poem, Hendricks, the poet, described the beauty and serenity this old woman loved about earth. I fell in love with that poem and taught it many times not knowing that I would in the future be learning that the old woman\u2019s wishes in the poem would become the reality of billions in paradise earth. So I understand why so many people wish to go to heaven. But when they come into an understanding of what paradise earth entails they are happy to hope for such a wonderful place to spend eternity. The bottom lines are: Man was created for the earth and not for heavenThe 144k go to heaven for a specific purposeFor man to go to heaven he has to be chosen by God and Jesus ChristHeaven is not a destination any human can make a choice to go, uninvitedThose who are called to heaven are changed from physical, mortal persons to spiritual, immortal beingsThey leave everything and everyone on earth willingly and are happy to become corulers with ChristIn this life they are not materialistic but focus on spiritual richesSo, Justin, I am looking forward to everlasting life on a peaceful earth. The ones who go to heaven are not superior to the ones on earth. Just as a president or prime minister is not superior to others in his country. It is a position that has to be filled. So the 144k are not superior Christians. Jesus started to choose them on the Day of Pentecost, has chosen them through the centuries and based on Bible chronology, most of them are already in heaven. Comparatively few are still on earth today. We may be nearer to realizing the paradise than we are aware. ",

            "answer_text": "Greetings, peace to you, and thank you for the A2A - I hesitated to answer; it's a very personal and subjective thing, is it not? But given most of the other responses, I have been directed to answer this\u2026 for the sake of truth. Yes. I am one from among the 12,000 sealed of tribe of Ben'JaH'Min. What does that mean? Everything\u2026 and nothing. It means \u201ceverything\u201d in that I have received a sealing from the One who repurchased me with his blood, as one from among 144,000 of the sons of Israel (and not non-Israelite Gentiles), which include Jews (those of the 2-tribe kingdom of \u201cJudah,\u201d consisting of the descendants Jacob/Israel's sons, JaH\u2019u\u2019dah and Ben'JaH'Min) and Samaritans (those of the 10-tribe kingdom of \u201cIsrael,\" consisting of the descendants of 9 of Jacob/Israel\u2019s other 10 sons - Dan is excluded and his portion given to JaH'Sef's son, Manasseh, so that, as Rachel's firstborn son, JaH'Sef has a double portion). This is \u201ceverything\u201d because it means the fulfillment of the promise to Abraham as to his seed. Initially, by means of Ad'Ham, ALL of mankind would have been sons of God, the \u201cFather\u201d (Begetter), who is the MOST Holy, because Ad'Ham himself was God's son (issue/get) - Luke 3:38. When Ad'Ham turned over his inheritance, however, he included his entire lineage (Genesis 1:28; Luke 4:6, 7; John 14:30; 1 John 5:19) and so mankind was given to and became the progeny of another \u201cfather\"\u2026 or begetter (John 8:44)\u2026 which \u201cfather\" had led them all to death.The MOST Holy planned to turn things around by allowing his other son, the \u201cSon\" (Issue/Get) who is (now) the Holy (Spirit - 2 Corinthians 3:17, 18) \u201cbeget\" children for Him, this time eternally (Isaiah 9:6). The entire group that was to become sons to replace the sons lost to the MOST Holy by Ad'Ham initially, were to be ALL of Abraham's descendants\u2026 through his son, Isaac, and Isaac's son, Jacob (aka Israel). To their great blessing, they were supposed to be a people for a special possession, a royal nation and holy priesthood. Not because they were special (indeed, they repeatedly showed how much they were not), but because Abraham was special. Abraham did not withhold his willingness to sacrifice his own son, Isaac (who came to him not by means of the flesh as his son Ishmael did, but by means of a promise to Abraham's barren wife, Sarah). In this, he proved he was the MOST Holy's true friend and Abraham was given the promise that by means of his seed, people of ALL the nations (and not just Israel) would be personally blessed. Isaac's (thwarted) sacrifice, however, was a precursor - because the new lineage would not be of an entirely new creation of humans (i.e., another Ad'Ham/Eve), but a renewing of Ad'Ham's seed. In order to effectuate this renewed lineage, however, something had to die. Because the (re)new(ed) lineage would be taken from among humans who had Ad'Ham's now tainted blood\u2026 which blood had sin\u2026 and so aging, sickness\u2026 death\u2026 in it. That blood had to be \u201ccleansed.\u201d In addition, the \u201csins\" (errors) of the spirits (\u201chearts\") of these (which errors have nothing to do with the flesh but with one's own motivations and desires)\u2026 had to be \u201cforgiven.\u201d BUT\u2026 a \u201cuniversal law\" of the spirit realm is that only blood can cover sins [of the spirit]. And so, unless blood is shed/poured out, no forgiveness of sins takes place (Hebrews 9:22). So, there had to be a sacrifice - no other way to get blood completely shed/poured out. And yes, it had to be shed/poured out completely, which is the critera to \u201ccover.\u201d Why? Because life\u2026 is in the blood (Leviticus 17:11). It is also in the breath (Genesis 2:7; Ezekiel 37:1-10)\u2026 and the seed (Matthew 1:20). No blood, no breath, no seed\u2026 no life. This blood, however, had to be able to cleanse and cover ALL sins for ALL\u2026 so it couldn't be mere animal blood. Hence, the coming sacrifice of the Son himself, to forgive and redeem from death, with his own blood (John 6:53-57), the sons that Ad'Ham had sold - mankind, in general. And starting with 144,000 of Abraham's seed through Jacob/Israel, that forgiveness and cleansing is granted. This group is \u201cspecial\u201d for only 3 reasons: They are the fulfillment of the promise to Abraham as to his seed;They are \u201cvirgins\u201d (but not as to the flesh - they are not all men - please don't believe that lie (Matthew 24:24); They are those, men and women who, from the time they are called to be part of the \u201cBride,\u201d keep themselves clean from the \u201cwomen\u201d who constitute the \u201cdaughters\" of the Harlot, Babylon the Great\u2026 which is made up of those religions that call themselves \u201cchristian\" (the others never claim to be joined to Christ - Matthew 23:8-12; 1 Corinthians 7:23; 1 John 2:26, 27). These are those of Abraham's seed through Jacob/Israel who, staying true to the \u201cBridegroom,\u201d Christ, the Son\u2026 and not committing adultery against him by fornicating with others\u2026 are \u201cvirgins\u201d when he returns to gather them (Matthew 24:31; 5:1-13; Revelation 14:4, 8; 17:1-6);They are the only one among Gods sons who learn and master the \u201cnew song.\u201d That song is a song of praise to the MOST Holy which only they are permitted to sing and they do so in the \u201cpure\" language of truth. They learn it during their lives, being taught directly by their King, Lamb (Psalm 110:2; Jeremiah 31:31-34), who is the Truth, and whose mouth speaks only truth (John 14:6; Proverbs 8:4-11, 22, 23; John 1:1, 14; Hebrews 4:12; Revelation 19:13-16).It truly is \u201cnothing,\u201d though, because those of this group of 144,000 \u201cfrom among the sons of Israel,\u201d are not the only ones called to be sons. Because the initially chosen nation, Israel/Judah, as a body, eventually rejected the \u201cfather\" sent to lead them, as a body, back to the MOST Holy, they were rejected as a body. But not entirely as a nation. Their calling was suspended and replaced by a calling to people of every nation, tribe, and tongue (Romans 11:25). This latter group, consisting of an innumerable company from ALL peoples, join with those 144,000 of from among Abraham's seed to make up the \u201cNEW Jerusalem.\u201d They ALL serve with Christ, The King and High Priest, as lesser kings and priests who provide \u201csacred\" (hence, priestly) service in and as the temple of the MOST Holy. They are ALL bought by Christ\u2026 with his blood for this very purpose : to rule and serve as priests with him in his kingdom, which rulership and priesthood he has chosen to share (Revelation 5:9, 10; 7:9-15; 1 Corinthians 3:16; 6:19; Ephesians 2:19-21; 1 Peter 2:5; Revelation 21:22). Once these, the 144,000 and the innumerable company, begin their rulership and priesthood, then ALL of Israel, Abraham's seed through Jacob/Israel, will be saved (Romans 11:26-32)\u2026 along with many, many others who are of none of these groups due their kindness and compassion toward others. They are \u201cseparated\u201d from the hard-hearted and uncompassionate (Matthew 25:31-46; Luke 10:30-37; Revelation 20:4). It is \u201cnothing,\u201d though, as to both groups because that kingship and priesthood is not one where the kings and priests are raised up\u2026 but where they are brought down. Like their God, the MOST Holy, and His Son, their Leader, their's is an administration of service to the people. Of caring for, ensuring the best for, handling matters in love, etc. All that a true son of the MOST not only can do\u2026 but will do. It is \u201cnothing,\u201d because they are from among the \u201cleast\" of mankind. They take and sit in the \u201clowly,\u201d seat among their brothers. They serve one another and mankind, not look to be served. They raise others up, not themselves. They look on others with compassion not jealousy or judgment. They give to the hungry, heal the sick, take care of the poor, etc. They speak truth with one another and as to, Christ, the Holy, and God, the MOST Holy (Exodus 26:33; Hebrews 9:3; 10:20; Revelation 21:22). As many others do. But there is a very important difference: They ONLY listen to and obey the voice of the LAMB and follows him wherever HE \u201cgoes,\u201d and soThey do not seek or do their OWN will but only that of the Father and Son.They literally \u201cdisown\" themselves\u2026 for the love of One who chose to give his blood to redeem them from Ad'Ham's choice for them\u2026 and those he loves: mankind (Proverbs 8:30, 31; John 3:16). I hope that helps. Again, peace to you! ",

            "answer_text": "Are you one of God's 144,000? Gross. It would take me claiming God\u2019s judgment to say that. I know God\u2019s judgment of me: that I am worth saving. God has judged all so. Christ came to save all. I accept Christ\u2019s sacrifice is on my behalf. I am saved. I am not under any other judgment. The finished work of God\u2019s judgment upon me is already pronounced. It is pronounced \u201cJesus Christ.\u201d Christ\u2019s merciful judgment has saved me. We must reject ourselves as the judge of humanity, in order to embrace Christ as judge. We are not fit to judge even ourselves. To judge a human being (even ourselves!) is to reject Christ as judge, and substitute ourselves. You cannot reject Christ as judge without rejecting Christ as savior - the two are one. No one is beyond Christ\u2019s saving power. But as we ourselves see fit to judge, we reject Christ and put ourselves under judgment. As we judge, so shall we be judged. And anyone who thinks their judgment is a fit substitute for Christ\u2019s judges horribly. As we judge, so shall we be judged. See fit, if you wish, to count and number yourself. See fit to judge the almost eight billion now living, observing with satisfaction how few can fit your limited conception of who shall be saved. See fit to judge all who have lived before, and account for where they stand in some number you misconstrue as the limit of Christ\u2019s mercy. Your accounting is foul and blasphemous. You are no judge of humanity. You are not fit to judge even in your own case. Thankfully, you have a better judge. I\u2019ll take whatever number God says is mine. I trust the judge, you see: for the judge is also my savior.  To the unversed reader: \u201cThe 144,000\u201d is a figure that appears in Revelations, and is misconstrued by unbiblical, unliteral dipsticks as the full count of people who shall be saved. They do this to make themselves feel Elect, special - as they tend to number themselves in the 144,000. They should go back and read the whole passage, where the entire 144,000 are referred to explicitly as Israelites, made up of the 12 tribes of Israel. Also saved, according to the same passage of Revelations, are \u201ca great multitude, which no man can number,\u201d out of all nations of the Earth. Actually now that I think of it, I\u2019m not of any tribe of Israel. So I\u2019d probably end up in the second group. But really, I\u2019ll take whatever number God gives me - and remain mindful of the fact that no man can number the saved. No, nor woman neither, I reckon. ",

They say there is going to be 144,000 men that will rein in heaven with Christ. They will be in spirit form as his helpers so to speak. Within the congregations they have some that claim they are of the annointed or 144,000. How they know? They say they just know. Growing up there was an elder in the congregation that claimed to be one of the 144,000 everybody knew him as this person. He was the elder that took many of my peers my age and pushed us to be baptised. I was 13, and I believe it was 6 of us youngsters that he guilded. After we were baptized, he was the one providing us alcohol and having sex with one of the 16 yr olds. He was disfellowshipped soon after. So Im guessing his calling he said as 144,000 was his own made up belief. Problem I had was the religion and congrgation believe this mans word of being one of the annointed and he was reguarded as one for years. ",

[1Th 4:13-18 NLT] (13) And now, dear brothers and sisters, we want you to know what will happen to the believers who have died so you will not grieve like people who have no hope. (14) For since we believe that Jesus died and was raised to life again, we also believe that when Jesus returns, God will bring back with him the believers who have died. (15) We tell you this directly from the Lord: We who are still living when the Lord returns will not meet him ahead of those who have died. (16) For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God. First, the Christians who have died will rise from their graves. (17) Then, together with them, we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. Then we will be with the Lord forever. (18) So encourage each other with these words. [Rev 19:11-21 NLT] (11) Then I saw heaven opened, and a white horse was standing there. Its rider was named Faithful and True, for he judges fairly and wages a righteous war. (12) His eyes were like flames of fire, and on his head were many crowns. A name was written on him that no one understood except himself. (13) He wore a robe dipped in blood, and his title was the Word of God. (14) The armies of heaven, dressed in the finest of pure white linen, followed him on white horses. (15) From his mouth came a sharp sword to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod. He will release the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty, like juice flowing from a winepress. (16) On his robe at his thigh was written this title: King of all kings and Lord of all lords. (17) Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, shouting to the vultures flying high in the sky: \"Come! Gather together for the great banquet God has prepared. (18) Come and eat the flesh of kings, generals, and strong warriors; of horses and their riders; and of all humanity, both free and slave, small and great.\" (19) Then I saw the beast and the kings of the world and their armies gathered together to fight against the one sitting on the horse and his army. (20) And the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who did mighty miracles on behalf of the beast--miracles that deceived all who had accepted the mark of the beast and who worshiped his statue. Both the beast and his false prophet were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur. (21) Their entire army was killed by the sharp sword that came from the mouth of the one riding the white horse. And the vultures all gorged themselves on the dead bodies. ",

            "answer_text": "The idea that there are only 144,000 of God people is inaccurate therefore crippling the Jehovah's Witness movement. The idea comes from the book of Revelation where it says that in the end times 144,000 people were sealed as God's chosen people. What the JW fail to realize is that this is a post rapture event, so AFTER God has come back for the current church THAN there will be at LEAST 144,000. This doesn't mean that throughout all time there will only ever be 144,000 believers. The idea that there are only 144,000 is preposterous as about 8,000,000 people world wide believe this and every one thinks that they are a part of the 144,000, that means that 7,856,000 people aren't true JW and it would be impossible to know who are part of the real JW movement and are truly God's people. That whole doctrine is a prime example of what happens when people don't understand the scriptures and take it out of context. To answer the question of who I think I am; I am a sinner who has been forgiven and washed by the blood of Christ my savior. Now I am a messenger of the living God and a vessel of his Holy Spirit and by his goodness I am a tool set apart for his divine work and my mission is to help spread the hope and peace I have found in God most high. I hope this clears up some of the misconceptions about the scriptures and I apologize if I came off a bit pointed. I tend to get quite passionate about subjects like this. God bless. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I am a spiritual Jew of the last spiritual tribe, spiritual Benjamin. THE ONLY REASON I AM SO FORTHRIGHT ABOUT IT IS TO POSSIBLY PROTECT OTHERS WHO WOULD SEEK TO HARM SOME THEM, MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE DECEPTIVE MANIPULATION OF BAD SPRITS UPON THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF SUCH SELF-PROCLAIMED ENEMIES. Some of the 144,000 are literal Jews but their being of the 144,000 has to do with their being spiritual Jews, spiritual Israel. Others of the spiritual Jews are gentiles. They are all Jews, by the promise from their heart and not by their flesh. The initial calling of the 144,000 started with fleshly Jews but it soon went also to gentiles. God does the choosing and Jesus does the anointing. They all have to prove faithful to God until death to be rewarded with a spirtual resurrection, heavenly life and immortality. The Devil constantly schemes and tries to get each one of them to fail. Some of their trials are seemingly and comparatively minimal, yet the maximum that will mold them for God's future purpose and what they can handle, while others may go through extreme trials for what they too will have to face in the future. Satan often works through people, usually non-believers and even those who believe but believe lies about God, to tempt them to do things that would cause them to loose their favor with God and protection from God, loosing out on life. The Devil is trying to delay as long as possible the complete number of 144,000 being filled. He wants to keep them from marching into heaven. Because when they do he and his angels will soon be thrown into suspended animation in solitary confinement in the abyss of nothingness and later put to death. ",

I have been watching many endless videos of some giving their testimonies but became concerned when people are relying on numbers, or EGW testimony of what will happen so hopefully me sharing may help others to sort it out. No experience may be the same. When I was sealed, I was pregnant with my son. This short story will either make you roll your eyes or laugh out of pity LOL. Now what I saw was indeed the Holy Spirit (dove) with bright white electric lights and I heard the word \u201cleader\u201d. Now I am no way a leader by any standard so naturally I decided that God must have blessed my son. So after he was born, I raised him like the lady in the Terminator movie (LOL) for her son. Afterall, it was about him right? Of course\u2026..phfft. Look I love my son but I inadvertently spoiled him by trying to prepare him for whatever God was going to do in his life. I now realized that I was like Sarai - going to make God\u2019s plan work with MY HELP. Boy was I wrong. Maybe about 3 or 4 months ago He showed me the tribe I was from and that was the first time I was actually excited. Shameful I know. I have always loved that Shaka Zulu movie especially when he says \u201cis there anyone else who has offended you mother\u201d hahahaha. Well anyway Shaka was from the tribe of Gad. I think I was on cloud 9 for a few days after that. TC!  ",

            "answer_text": "(Revelation 14:1) Then I saw, and look! the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who have his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.\u201d Here we see the limited number of these anointed ones\u2014144,000. Their royal status is discerned in that they stand with Jehovah\u2019s enthroned King, \u201cthe Lamb,\u201d Jesus. And they are on heavenly Mount Zion. Earthly Mount Zion was the location of Jerusalem, Israel\u2019s royal city. Heavenly Mount Zion represents the exalted position of Jesus and his joint heirs, who make up heavenly Jerusalem.\u20142 Chronicles 5:2; Psalm 2:6. Jesus and his associates rule from a superior position. In his dream-vision, Daniel also saw that \u201cthe kingdom and the rulership . . . were given to the people who are the holy ones.\u201d (Daniel 7:27) Jesus does not rule alone. He has others with him who are to rule as kings and serve as priests. (Revelation 5:9, 10; 20:6) Concerning them, the apostle John wrote: \u201cI saw, and, look! the Lamb standing upon the Mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand . . . who have been bought from the earth.\u201d\u2014Revelation 14:1-3. The Lamb is Jesus Christ in his Kingdom position. (John 1:29; Revelation 22:3) This Mount Zion refers to heaven. (Hebrews 12:22) Jesus and his 144,000 associates are ruling from heaven. What a lofty position from which to rule! Being in heaven, they have a broader perspective. Since heaven is its seat, \u201cthe kingdom of God\u201d is also called \u201cthe kingdom of the heavens.\u201d (Luke 8:10; Matthew 13:11) No weapons, not even nuclear attacks, can reach and topple that heavenly government. It is unconquerable and will fulfill Jehovah\u2019s purpose for it.\u2014Hebrews 12:28. God\u2019s Kingdom has trustworthy representatives on earth. How do we know this? Psalm 45:16 states: \u201cYou will appoint . . . princes in all the earth.\u201d \u201cYou\u201d in this prophecy is the Son of God. (Psalm 45:6, 7; Hebrews 1:7, 8) Hence, Jesus Christ himself will appoint the princely representatives. We can be sure that they will be faithful in carrying out his direction. Even today, qualified men who serve as elders in the Christian congregation are taught, not to \u201clord it over\u201d their fellow believers, but to protect, refresh, and comfort them.\u2014Matthew 20:25-28; Isaiah 32:2. The Kingdom has righteous subjects. They are blameless and upright in God\u2019s eyes. (Proverbs 2:21, 22) \u201cThe meek ones themselves will possess the earth,\u201d says the Bible, \u201cand they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.\u201d (Psalm 37:11) The subjects of the Kingdom are meek\u2014teachable and humble, mild and gentle. Their primary interests are spiritual matters. (Matthew 5:3) They want to do what is right and are responsive to divine direction. God\u2019s Kingdom is governed by superior laws. The laws and principles governing the Kingdom come from Jehovah God himself. Rather than unfairly restrict us, they benefit us. (Psalm 19:7-11) Many people are already benefiting from living by Jehovah\u2019s righteous requirements. For example, heeding the Bible\u2019s counsel to husbands, wives, and children improves our family life. (Ephesians 5:33\u20136:3) When we obey the command to \u2018clothe ourselves with love,\u2019 our relationship with others improves. (Colossians 3:13, 14) As we live by Scriptural principles, we also cultivate good work habits and a balanced view of money. (Proverbs 13:4; 1 Timothy 6:9, 10) Avoiding drunkenness, sexual immorality, tobacco, and addictive drugs helps us to safeguard our health.\u2014Proverbs 7:21-23; 23:29, 30; 2 Corinthians 7:1. The Kingdom of God is a government ordained by God. Its King\u2014the Messiah, Jesus Christ\u2014and all his associate rulers are responsible to God to uphold His just laws and loving principles. The subjects of the Kingdom, including its earthly representatives, take delight in living by God\u2019s laws. God is thus at the center of the lives of the rulers and the subjects of the Kingdom. Therefore, the Kingdom is a true theocracy\u2014rule by God. It is bound to succeed in accomplishing the purpose for which it has been set up. But when does God\u2019s Kingdom, also known as the Messianic Kingdom, begin its rule In harmony with this, the anointed in their heavenly glory are also spoken of as \u201cNew Jerusalem.\u201d (Revelation 21:2) Earthly Jerusalem was \u201cthe city of the great King\u201d and also the location of the temple. (Matthew 5:35) The heavenly New Jerusalem is the royal Kingdom organization through which the great Sovereign, Jehovah, and his appointed King, Jesus, now rule and in which priestly service is performed as rich blessings flow from Jehovah\u2019s throne for the healing of mankind. (Revelation 21:10, 11; 22:1-5) In another vision John hears faithful, resurrected, anointed Christians referred to as \u2018the Lamb\u2019s wife.\u2019 What a warm picture this paints of the intimacy they will enjoy with Jesus and of their willing subjection to him! Picture the joy in heaven when the last of them finally receives his heavenly reward. Now, at last, \u201cthe marriage of the Lamb\u201d can take place! That royal heavenly organization will then be complete.\u2014Revelation 19:6-8.

            "answer_text": "Anyone who believes that God raised Jesus Christ from the dead, and confesses Jesus with his mouth, (anyone who has been saved in other words); is part of the 144000. This is because the 144000 are simply a symbol of the church. The key to understanding this is in Revelation chapter 21, where it describes the New Jerusalem, another symbol of the church. The twelve gates are inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel- the old covenant church; while the twelve foundations are inscribed with the names of the twelve apostles- the new covenant church. Multiply 12 by 12, and that gives you the 144. Per verse 16; the length, height and breadth of the city were all the same; in other words, it was a cube. Multiply 10 by 10 by 10, and you have a thousand. So- 144 000; simply a symbol of the church. The passage reads; \u2018Then one of the seven angels with the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, \u201cCome, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.\u201d 10And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the holy city of Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, 11shining with the glory of God. Its radiance was like a most precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. 12The city had a great and high wall with twelve gates inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, and twelve angels at the gates. 13There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west. 14The wall of the city had twelve foundations bearing the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 15The angel who spoke with me had a golden measuring rod to measure the city and its gates and its walls. 16The city lies foursquare, with its width the same as its length. And he measured the city with the rod, and all its dimensions were equal\u201412,000 stadiad in length and width and height. 17And he measured its wall to be 144 cubits,e by the human measure the angel was using. 18The wall was made of jasper, and the city itself of pure gold, as pure as glass. 19The foundations of the city walls were adorned with every kind of precious stone: The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, 20the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. 21And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, with each gate consisting of a single pearl. The main street of the city was pure gold, as pure as transparent glass. 22But I saw no temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. 23And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, because the glory of God illuminates the city, and the Lamb is its lamp. 24By its light the nations will walk, and into it the kings of the earth will bring their glory.f 25Its gates will never be shut at the end of the day, because there will be no night there. 26And into the city will be brought the glory and honor of the nations. 27But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who practices an abomination or a lie, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb\u2019s Book of Life.\u2019 ",

They are all from the tribes of the children of Israel , 12000 from each of the 12 tribes. This is a special blessing for the Messianic Jews. They have learned a new song that no one else can learn, and follow the Lamb withersoever He goeth. The 144,000 are not presently known because they are sealed by angels just before the great day of God\u2019s wrath on the earth and it's inhabitants. This is at the time of the opening of the 7 Seals, and the appearance of the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Rev. 6). So, up until this moment in time there are no 144,000, until angels seal them to redeem them from God\u2019s wrath. Revelation 7:3 - 7:8, and Rev. 14: 1\u20135 ",

These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and the Lamb.

It is saying that these 144,000 are the purest men on the earth, having never lost their virginity, and being faithful to God and His Christ. Those were 12,000 each from the 12 tribes of Israel, sealed solely for God and Christ. Then, those who are Saved who have been married, had children, etc. and have remained faithful will be caught up in the air to meet Christ. Then those who are faithful, even unto death, will be brought after the Great Tribulation. Those who are persecuted and executed for their faith.
