You know, one of those enemies that you are so compelled to hate and battle so constantly, that you understand them and love them in some way. Preferably, they would be someone that you are evenly matched with so that you could continue to battle each other without there ever being a clear winner. It would be so incredible to have an eternal mortal enemy to battle it out with for centuries, and in some sense know that there is a certain form of camaraderie in it. It wouldn't be a nightmare, or an exhausting ordeal, but a beautiful and epic rivalry that could go on for ever. ",
