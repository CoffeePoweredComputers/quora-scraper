            "answer_text": "Matt gives a great answer. I think he\u2019s right, it is not entirely clear what the site was used for and why it was built. I do think a meeting place at prearranged times has merit, possibly at solstice and or equinox. I note for example that bird-man has marks both in the background and on the ribs of the entwined snakes that are specifically the number of days in the year! This implies this culture had a calendar and the site is thought to be used a few times each year for a few weeks on each occasion. So although this culture does not have a written language, they are at least numerate and keepers of time (of year). This gives some substance to the emerging theory that these tribes were meeting throughout the year, they could do so as it appears they had a calendar! So although it doesn\u2019t explain why the site was built, it does allude to how all the tribes were able to meet at the same time and does suggest a critical development stage and planning. If you think about it, before hunters and gathers could consider purposefully planting seed and farming, they need a calendar! This shows they have a critical enabler to be able to advance to the next stage and this is such a good idea it's recorded! There is evidence of brewing on-site, so some form of celebration may have taken place, somewhere to meet to find partners and exchange knowledge and things (trade commodities and tools) perhaps.  This figure found on site is interesting, I\u2019m hugely impressed by it, I think it is as significant as the Antikythera mechanism. Its been treated as art, but it's actually very scientific (for the time) according to what it actually records. A count of days would be impressive enough, but there are hints of a deeper understanding of underlying principles based upon long observation and study. I think observatory may need to be included as a possible additional function for the site. It seems to represent the Sun, flying across the sky each day (looking East at sunrise and a cardinal direction is shown on the neck). I\u2019ve been pondering what the 9 sun discs could be, they may represent years, this is significant as using inclusive counting may represent a longer period beyond a year, specifically eight-year plus one or two days: an Octaeteris (or 9 years using inclusive counting). Much later civilisations did use this convention, so there is a possibility this is the first use (rather than a random detail). I think this needs to be considered as a good understanding of astronomy is demonstrated, as to is a disciplined approach to be able to define a count of days in a year. If this culture is studying astronomy which appears to be the case, then they may have realised this coincides with five Venusian visibility cycles (a longer period). Later civilisations around this region do refer to the celestial bodies that could be observed particularly Mother Earth (Gaia) giving a day (the later Minoans don\u2019t seem to associate a day with the Sun rather the Earth), the Moon (giving months), the Sun giving a year (shown above) and Venus (giving Olympiad and Octaeteris, it is Herakles that introduces the Games to the Greeks, but there is an older Herakles, the constellation, the thumb being the pole star in the time of GT). The conventions for periods don\u2019t seem to have been developed rather were known and written down, which suggests that these conventions are older. Some will say the Olympiad was a Greek invention, its a Minoan convention and they came from Anatolia, it\u2019s likely they celebrated adding a \u2018leap-day\u2019 every four years to keep an accurate calendar, by leaping the bull (which is confirmed on a fresco horizontal borders, 49 lunar months). Somewhat speculative on my part, but I wonder if a nine-year period has significance to this culture for appointing a leader of the tribes? That perhaps adjudicates over disputes between the tribes, this is a sufficient social organisation to warrant this. Tribes are meeting at GT at regular intervals. If so the periods for a term in office could be a hugely old convention, the Minoans have exactly this same convention, Minos literally means nine years (in office). The significance of the snake may have been that it is one of the few things that could represent these high number counts, a snake has 200\u2013400 ribs that would allow the days in the year to be counted! This convention seems to be hugely old, used in prehistory and even by civilisations, but perhaps its original meaning and purpose became lost. I also note it is associated with Earth, Night, North and Winter. The Sun (son) by contrast Sunlight, Midday, South and Summer. The stone with symbols shown below is also found at GT the middle symbol is a Linear A ideogram (not syllabary symbol), no 122. The founders of Minoan Crete are the Dactyls (fingers) that are thought to be from Anatolia. I also note that the same symbol is present in a protowriting system called Vinca symbols, used around 5,500 BCE. How is this possible without writing, they have a protowriting system! This raises an interesting point, linguists have commented that the Minoan written language Linear A is not of a known Indo-European language group, I wonder if the reason it's not recognised is that it may be based on a hugely older one which is actually Indo-European. The point being is that this would only be possible if they have a method of recording information (accepting what is shown are ideograms), as illustrated here:  The Minoans use the centre symbol to indicate the main axis of mother Earth (Gaia) as shown on this much later Minoan seal, her son is the Sun shown on the first artefact. These early symbols seem to relate to calendars and cardinal direction which the hunters and gather at GT will have needed to navigate with the seasons to food sources and meet at standard times of the year!  I personally think the emphasis on religion at GT could be overly used, if the symbols shown here are indeed deities then they are very practical deities that define the seasons into quarters and give days in the year to keep an annual solar calendar. I note some of the other iconography and symbols on-site may have an astronomical meaning, the so-called H symbol (and when rotated by 90 degrees) may relate to equinox and solstice for example. I also note that Vultures circle, perhaps this alludes to what the builders seem to want to better understand (orbits, astronomical cycles and time). Some of the other sites around this area are already starting to show trade specialism (some pottery, some mining obsidian, some with needlework/leatherwork), it would make sense for them to meet to exchange them for the other things they needed and other tribes in the area had access to or produced. Update: Niels (see comments) suggested the headpiece, might relate to the Moon, I did a \u2018quick\u2019 count (the hashed marking that appear as a beard), its around 28 if the forward and backward hashing are considered as a day. This sparked an idea, do the forward hashes mean day (light) and the backward hashing mean night? The totality of the count on the device then still represent a full year, the background is the summer half (forward light and backward nights), and the snakes the winter half. This then divides the year using equinox. The device seems to work at an obvious level a count of days in the year, but perhaps contains more than this. Could I ask the archaeologists to perform a count, they are much better than I at looking at these artefacts, from a layperson perspective, the counts seem to relate to astronomical time periods. This object is carefully made, the marks deliberate. I can\u2019t see this is a random occurrence there are more than one count and the count is contextually appropriate for what is being shown, there are an equal number of days between equinox dividing the year into two halves (summer associate with the Sun and Winter the snake (implying Draco). Another seal from Assyria slightly early than this, tends to confirm dividing the year into seasons that may be associated with cardinal directions also. We also know that the later prehistory of solar wheels is being used throughout Europe, which tends to support that a year was divided into quarters and I believe this is specific evidence of the first known practice.

            "answer_text": "Gobekli was a 'place-calendar', an almanac. Now it is almost a desert but then this area was well-watered because northern glaciers were still in place. This was 10,200 BCE. The Sahara was still grassland, as well. This area was forested and had game. It supported a large number of people. Gobekli was a gathering place. Its carvings and stone images are of animals, mostly carnivores but also some herbivores. They probably are astral signs and its pillars designed to capture solstices and equinoxes. Its walls have at least one picture of a crescent Moon around the Sun. It probably had a wooden superstructure for sightings. Eventually, the area dried up and passed into legend. It was still a sacred place and was covered up with dirt because it had 'died'. The ocean's level had drowned coastal habitation so people responded by building fishing boats and settling the Mediterranean's islands. As well, the Sahara dried up and its tribes migrated to the Nile. The Gobekli people must have migrated to Mesopotamia from its north. The Semites moved there from the Persian Gulf and the Hamites to the Nile from the Red Sea.This mixing of peoples produced renaissances in these areas subsequently\u2026 ",
