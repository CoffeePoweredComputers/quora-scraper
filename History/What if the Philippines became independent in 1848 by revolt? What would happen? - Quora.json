            "answer_text": "Sorry for providing such a long answer. Two possibilities. The second one is quite obvious, so I\u2019ll only tell you the first part. The Thailand-esque routeSuppose the revolt is a highly organised one, where there are coordinated attacks around the country, not just around the Tagalog provinces and Central Luzon. The Philippines would have likely formed a monarchist government, with the Rajah as the head of state, as the country has not been introduced to the ideals of democracy. Their style of governance may have been a mix of Majapahit and European monarchism. Territorial-wise, it would have been intially smaller because of the Moros, but it may be able to annex them due to the familiarity with the environment. It will prove to be \u201cbeneficial\u201d later on. For its foreign relations, it may try to balance the relationship between the two European powers, the British and the Dutch, and lean more to their fellow independent Asian neighbours, Thailand and Japan specifically. Luzviminda (the Philippines) would have indrustrialised shortly after the Meiji restoration, but not to the same extent as Japan. Fast forward to the 20th century. As Japan makes progress in colonising Korea and Taiwan, Luzviminda goes low profile during this period as she is not able to do the same due to the fact that her allies and powerful countries surround her, not to mention their alliances. Despite Taiwan having Austronesian natives and a significant Han Chinese diaspora, it is highly unlikely that Japan would\u2019ve given it to Luzviminda as she was grooming it to become the \u201cmodel colony\u201d. As a result, Luzviminda is confined to being a sphere of interest of Japan. Despite being an ally of Japan, Luzviminda chooses to be neutral after observing their circumstances. Much to Luzviminda\u2019s shock, Japan invaded in order to build her Co-prosperity sphere. Luzviminda agreed to become a passive member of the Axis, just like Thailand. However, somewhere around mid-1943, the government secretly agreed to join the Allies as a retribution. This started by giving them intelligence, eventually engaging in a war openly with Japan when one of the messages was intercepted. After the war, the Allies awarded Luzviminda with Taiwan, with strong opposition from the ROC. Post WW2 era. As usual, the British loved partition plans , Malaysia gets formed, with opposition from Indonesia and Luzviminda, who are strong proponents of Nusantara Raya. Konfrontasi follows, then Operation Merdeka, which prolonged the occupation of the British armed forces, though they eventually pulled out due to exhaustion and coordinated attacks. The concept of Nusantara Raya was scrapped however, because of disagreements between Indonesia and Luzviminda on the terms and conditions. Despite the outcome, the two maintained very close relations. Through the 70s up to the mid 80s, the country would\u2019ve experienced a coup d\u2019etat and military rule, as usual for Asian countries, before transitioning to a constitutional monarchy like Britain. (Communists in the country failed to achieve their goal due to the strong support from the Americans during the Cold war and the strong \u201cRajah\u201d culture, must thank Japan for that.)

            "answer_text": "I doubt it would remain to exist as a single entity. Even with the present timeline we saw how divided the country even after winning the revolution against Spain. The revolution was rife with regionalism, loyalty to generals and worse only to Aguinaldo. The country after the revolution was in no shape to repel any foreign colonizers. With no foreign power to protect, recognize or support the country (e.g. USA like it did to Cuba), I do not think the country will last long. Japan has an interest of the country so as Germany and Britain among the others. The country will be divided once more and probably Mindanao will be included to Malaysia or Indonesia. In World War 2 the country will face terrible fate and post-war recovery may be Short answer the country will not exist as a single entity. ",
