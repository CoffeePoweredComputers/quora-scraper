            "answer_text": "It\u2019s an odd name for a war that was almost a world war. The term is only used in the USA and has a very narrow perspective. Most of the English speaking world refers to it as the Seven Years\u2019 War. Not exactly the catchiest of names but right up there with the famous War of 1812. The historians must have spend at least one sleepless night thinking that one up. The war did indeed involve the French and it did involve \u201cIndians\u201d as in the US usage but also Indians as in people from India since the war was fought on the high seas, in Europe, In North America including the very valuable Caribbean colonies and in India as I said. Anywhere where French and British interests clashed. Since one of the major battles took place in present Canada Canadians should have a determining vote as to the name of the war, don\u2019t you think. I am assuming you know which battle I am speaking of. It is one of the key battles in North American History. ",
