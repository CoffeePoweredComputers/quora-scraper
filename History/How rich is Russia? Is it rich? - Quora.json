            "answer_text": "This is tricky answer. How some others mentioned Russia has a huge amount of natural resources, relatively educated population, etc. Theoretically, the country should prosper almost automatically and the people here should be really rich ... but they are not. One of symbolic detail - The country doesn't product many technologies for minning of these resources. In other words, It has to import many of these technologies from foreigner countries.  This overview is a very clear view of Russia as an economy Russian export  Simmilar structure of export have developing African/Asian/American countries (The lucky ones with natural resources) . The low diversification of the Russian economy has not been a problem just in recent years but for tens years.  In the twentieth century, Russia transformed from an absolutely backward country into a \u201clarge gas station\u201d in economic way. Having natural resources could be quite problematic sometimes. It does not \u201cforce\u201d the economy/societx to innovate very much and Russia is probably the best example of this situation.  If we look at any socio-economic statistics from Russia (and we will believe that it is not manipulated, because the Russian statistical office behave (at least) strange). The country is not in very good condition but mainly ordinary Russians are not in really good condition, compared to developed countries(naturally still better than in the 90s) Data about living standards are sometimes shocking, moreover Russia has extremely historical problems with huge social differences, respectively social inequalities which are fully in line with developing countries, read \u201crich ppl are everywhere but what about others? \u201c  By the way, there is another indirect proof of how Russia is doing as a country and the Russians as a society. If you live in a western developed country like me, you have probably noticed that more and more of them come and live here every year. Finally, I rememberef this\u2026 \"About one-third of 117,000 medical facilities that were inspected lack running water and more than 40 percent lack central heating, according to the Audit Chamber, the Russian government\u2019s public spending watchdog.\" Frankly, I was shocked by this\u2026 and this is just the one of thousands mmnts when you realize in connection to this question. No, It isn't\u2026 ",
