            "answer_text": "Yes, but it might have taken a few months longer. If the US did not enter then we must presume that Japan did not either, in which case more Australian and Indian troops would have fought on the British side in Europe. The USSR was already winning the war against Germany following the victories at Moscow during the winter of 1941\u201342 and the decisive Stalingrad victory the following year. Both of these came before lend lease aid from the US and Britain had much impact. Assuming US aid did flow, the USSR would be at least as effective as it was in the actual war. The USSR would have faced a half dozen more German divisions in 1943 than it actually did, but this would not have changed much. This was not enough to stop the continuous wave of Soviet victories after Kursk. Britain still would have beaten Rommel and his Italian allies in North Africa, though perhaps a little slower. The British counteroffensive would not have landed directly in France, yet large German forces would still be pinned down there. Britain could have still knocked Italy out of the war in 1943, using more Indian and Australian troops to replace the missing Americans. Britain would have still won the air war, but with less daylight strategic bombing and even larger US aircraft supplies, since the US Air Force would be claiming less of its factories\u2019 prodigious output. Air superiority over the Germans would not have been as decisively overwhelming as it was by 1944, but still sufficient. The British offensives in 1944 would have come in Norway and the Balkans (with help from Tito\u2019s partisans in Yugoslavia), rather than in France. Churchill tried to push such a Balkan strategy on Roosevelt in actual fact, but failed. Germany would still have a large army of occupation tied down in France to deal with partisans and the possibility of another British landing like that at Dieppe in 1942, only larger. However, the British would not risk a full-scale invasion of France. Instead they would use their much superior sea power to liberate Norway, cutting off Germany\u2019s vital iron ore supplies from Sweden, and join forces with Tito to cut off Germany from its equally vital oil supplies in Romania, in cooperation with the 1944 Soviet offensive. The war might end with the Soviet Red Army occupying most of Germany and the Nazis still hanging on in France, but they would be forced to surrender some time in 1945 in any case. The biggest difference would be a Cold War with a Red Germany under Soviet influence, rather than divided with most of its industrial economy allied to the West. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is yes, probably, but it would have taken probably years longer, and the USSR might have been able to occupy most of continental Europe east of the Rhine. Assuming the US was generous with its material aid, the Axis powers would have been at a great disadvantage in terms of equipment and supplies, particularly oil. In particular, the USSR would still have been able to grind down the Germans through sheer weight of numbers, it would have taken longer and been more bloody. Britain would have found great difficulty in invading northern France in 1945, and might have taken a path through southern France and Italy - Churchill always favored peripheral attacks. Similarly, British Empire/Commonwealth forces would have been able to slowly overpower the Japanese, although the road to victory would probably have run through SE Asia rather than island hopping in the Pacific. The allies\u2019 main problem would have been manpower constraints. The wild card would be the British atomic weapons program. Optimistically, with US material support, they might have had a viable weapon by 1947, probably ahead of the Germans. As in our world, the war would have ended very shortly after that. ",
