            "answer_text": "Well, there are two main metrics for how \u201cgood\u201d an investment is: risk and reward. If the \u201crisk\u201d is high, then so are the chances that you\u2019ll lose your money, at least in the short term. If the \u201crisk\u201d is low, then you\u2019re almost 100% certain to keep (or grow) your money. If the \u201creward\u201d is high, you\u2019ll earn lots of money. If the \u201creward\u201d is low, then you won\u2019t earn lots of money; in fact, you might even lose a little bit of money (for example, if you keep your money in a savings account, it might lose value over time due to inflation). Here are the main types of investments: Real EstateStocksBonds (including CDs [Certificates of Deposit])Interest-Bearing Bank Accounts (e.g. Savings, Money Market.There are also things like mutual funds, index funds, etc. but usually those are just based on the above investments. For example, a stock mutual fund is just many, many stocks. A bond fund is just many, many bonds. A REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) is just a derivative of real estate. Which investments have the highest reward? Stocks (10% return on investment [ROI] on average during the past 100 years in America)Real Estate (10% on average historically but with more fees like maintenance/repairs/property tax)Bonds (5% on average historically)Interest-Bearing Bank Accounts (3% historically)Note that all of these percentages are in America, and historical. For example, it would be impossible to find a US bank offering 3% now. However, as an investor, you generally must think long-term. Which investments have the highest risk? Stocks (during the Great Depression, the stock market lost over 23% of its value in just two days)Real Estate (Lehman Shock, housing crisis in the late 2000s)Bonds (usually pretty reliable, but on rare occasion, you can lose your money, especially with junk bonds)Interest-Bearing Bank Accounts (in the US, they\u2019re FDIC-insured, so you WILL NOT lose your money unless the US government collapses or something)Note how the lists are ordered exactly the same way! The highest-reward things are the highest-risk. The lowest-reward things are the lowest-risk. Therefore, you need to decide how much risk you\u2019re willing to take. What are you saving for? A short-term goal? A long-term goal? If you\u2019re saving for a short-term goal (e.g. you\u2019re going to go to college one year from now, or saving for the downpayment on a house two years from now), consider something low-risk like a savings/Money Market account, CD, or bond. If you\u2019re saving for something long-term (e.g. you\u2019re 20 years old and want to retire at 65 and save for retirement), consider stocks or real estate. Yes, stocks can lose a huge amount of money in the short term, but over the years (especially decades), they have always gone back up in the end, and have the highest average return. Real estate is kind of in the middle. Real estate often has respectable returns (not quite as good as stocks, particularly lately), but it is much less likely that you\u2019ll lose a huge amount in a short time. In Japan, real estate returns an average of 5.5% in the 23 Special Wards of Tokyo, 6.5% in the outlying areas, and 7%+ in certain specialty areas. Risk in the 23 Special Wards of Tokyo is extremely low; 95% of units have a tenant in them, so you\u2019ll almost certainly have a tenant most of the time. Foreigners can also buy land and buildings, and with no restrictions. How to Buy Japanese Real Estate from Overseas It is a good middle-of-the-road investment. Not very risky, and yes, it will make your money grow.  (real estate in Nagoya [\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b], in central Japan) ",

            "answer_text": "1. Live below your means. This doesn\u2019t just mean staying out of debt, but also cutting costs so you can save for both short- and long-term goals, from big expenses to retirement. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do that, the rest of the stuff doesn\u2019t matter because you don\u2019t have money to invest,\u201d said Mel Lindauer, one of the moderators of the forum. 2. Cost matters. When we approach our investments, people tend to focus on their returns. But, as Bogle said on the second day of the conference, \u201ccost is the only thing that matters.\u201d The effect that costs have on performance can be neatly summed up in the below chart, showing that lower cost funds (in red) beat higher-cost funds (in tan) no matter what asset class they covered. 3. Buy the market/diversify. But actually scratch that last bit of advice, because if cost matters, then the only funds you should be looking at are index funds. Buying the market has two benefits: First, it naturally diversifies your holdings, hedging your risk. Second, you\u2019ll do better than most other investors after subtracting the fees other investors pay in actively managed funds. 4. Don\u2019t look at past returns to gauge future performance. \u201cThat\u2019s what a lot of people do \u2014 especially new investors,\u201d says Lindauer \u2014 and if that\u2019s their first error, their second is that when they look at past returns, they tend to be looking at actively managed funds. This is the classic \u201cbuy high, sell low\u201d mistake. As Vanguard chief investment officer Tim Buckley said, \u201cWhen equities are going well, people pour money into them. When it crashes they get out\u2026. People are still chasing performance.\u201d 5. Never try to time the market. \u201cPeople try to time the low spot and the high spot. They\u2019re in and out. If you\u2019re going to bail, you\u2019ve got to be right twice, because now you need to know when to get back in,\u201d said Lindauer. \u201cPeople bail out and then they wonder when\u2019s a good time to get back in, and they wait and wait and wait, and watch the market go back up, up and up, and then say, \u2018Okay, now it\u2019s safe to get back in\u2019 \u2014 just about the time it peaks.\u201d 6. Stick to your goals. Just as you shouldn\u2019t let drops in the market rattle you, don\u2019t let other news do so either. \u201cThe debt ceiling crisis \u2014 not sure how that would change your goals,\u201d said Buckley. \u201cIf you had a kid or if your kid graduated from college, that is a reason to change your goals, not what Congress is doing.\u201d 7. Save as much as you can, as early as you can. Saving early allows you to take advantage of the power of compounding. If Person A saves $5,000 a year from age 25 to 40 for a total of $75,000 and then never invests another penny, and Person B invests $5,000 every year from 40 to 65 for a total of $125,000 invested, assuming 5% growth, Person A will end up with more than $400,000 by retirement, while Person B will only have $256,000, simply because Person A started saving earlier, even if she put away less. 8. Look at the big picture. Often, people fixate on the wrong details. For instance, they\u2019ll focus on the performance of one investment, instead of the overall portfolio. If you\u2019re guilty of this, keep it simple: go with a target-date fund, which is a mutual fund that is a collection of stocks and bonds whose allocation is determined by your projected retirement date. 9. Automate good behaviors. Don\u2019t rely on yourself to take the time and energy to invest regularly. We all have busy lives. Instead, invest automatically with every paycheck so that you don\u2019t fall victim to laziness or panic and stop buying if stocks are down. Another thing you should do is rebalance, which means resetting your investments back to your original allocation after you\u2019ve given them some time to grow. For instance, if you started with 80% in stocks and 20% in bonds, but after a year, your stocks comprised 85% of your portfolio, you should sell your equities to get back to 80%. Some companies will automatically rebalance for you, but if yours doesn\u2019t, then set up your own system. Some people rebalance on their birthday; others wait until they\u2019re five or 10 percentage points off from their initial allocation. 10. Minimize taxes. Various investment accounts offer different tax benefits. For instance, a Roth Individual Retirement Arrangement levies taxes on your contributions now but allows your investments to grow tax-free. Employer-sponsored accounts like 401(k)s and 403(b)s allow you to defer taxes now, though you\u2019ll have to pay Uncle Sam when you withdraw the money during retirement. Some people have additional investment accounts since retirement accounts limit annual contributions, but these accounts are taxable. More information needed contact to Sharekhan. ",
