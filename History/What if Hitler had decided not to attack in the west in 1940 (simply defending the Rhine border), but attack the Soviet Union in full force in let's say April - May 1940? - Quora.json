            "answer_text": "Several scenarios.  First, Nazi Germany invades Poland 1 September 1939 and the Soviet Union invades Poland 17 September 1939 per the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact signed in August. Britain and France declare war on Germany and get their forces in place along the western border of Germany and along the Belgian border.  [image source] They don\u2019t invade when they get into position though, resulting in the \u201cPhony War\u201d. IF Britain and France still make noise about Sweden\u2019s iron ore and invade Norway since that\u2019s how most of the ore leaves Sweden for Germany (the Swedish port freezes in winter). Denmark and Norway are invaded in early April. Denmark falls 9 April. Norway continues to fight until early June. This ties up several divisions that could be used in the east. OR IF Britain and France don\u2019t make noise about the iron ore and Germany doesn\u2019t need to use those forces taking the Nordic countries. They can be used in the east. This idea assumes that planning to invade the Soviet Union happened earlier because the German Army needed time to get in position. In real life, that took longer due to \u2026 let\u2019s call them distractions like Norway (April-June 1940) and North Africa (June 1940\u20131943). North Africa happened because Italy was losing ground to the British. So, they didn\u2019t happen. Italy had to hold their ground in North Africa. One of the problems invading Russia is Rasputitsa, also called General Mud, Marshal Mud or Mud Season. I suspect you\u2019ve guessed the common topic: mud. It\u2019s a time when unpaved roads through Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia become deep muck that sucks boots, wagons, and trucks into a near standstill. 10 kilometers on a dry or frozen road is easy but Rasputitsa occurs in the spring (April-May) and fall (October-November). If Germany invades in April or May they would have run directly into mud. The number of paved roads in the region were pretty small. Over 40% of rural villages at the time never came near a paved road. Rasputitsa was considered one Russia\u2019s great natural defenses. So, your idea throws the German Army directly into the spring mud rather than the autumn mud. Yes, it would get better but in real life, Germany\u2019s major victories in 1941 were in July, August, and September. They stalled in late September and into October requiring significantly more effort and resources (fuel, men, horses, etc) to move any distance. Your plan puts them straight into the mud on day 1\u2026 or maybe day 5 or 10. The better option is to wait for the spring rains to end and give the clay soil a little time to dry out. Oh, wait. That would probably be mid-June. Okay, aside from that\u2026 maybe they get bogged down then hit their stride as soon as it dries out. I still say they don\u2019t reach Moscow. Why? Because Hitler kept changing the directives in real life. As the Soviets threw whole armies to slow the Nazis down, the Nazis had to surround and destroy those armies. That took time. Stalin and Stavka (the Red Army command) would still do that. The German Army might have gotten closer but I suspect many of the divisions not used in Norway or North Africa would get chewed up by the mud. Or, at least, worn down. You might think I\u2019m putting too much emphasis on this mud but if you read about the autumn 1941 campaign you will find it really hurt the German Army. They would have to endure two of those in 1940. Then the winter would come where equipment froze and lubricants became viscous. Much more than they should. I see the timing would be different but I suspect - and this can, of course, only be a suspicion - Germany doesn\u2019t meet their objectives and the Soviets have time to regroup.  Now, there is something else to consider. With a significant number of German troops in the east\u2026 what is Britain and France doing? In real life, Germany didn\u2019t need the build up in the east in April and May 1940 so they had more troops in the west. But, if they\u2019re tied up in the east then Britain probably doesn\u2019t have Dunkirk and France probably doesn\u2019t fall. Probably. But, they are clearly in a stronger position. I strongly doubt they had the right organization or, in some cases, equipment to defeat Germany from the west but it would force movement in troops that might have been used in the east. I\u2019m not sure we can predict the number necessary to hold the western front. One thing is certain, though, the invading force would have to go through the shorter French-German border. Britain would not have invaded Belgium and the Netherlands to reach Germany. So, their position required Germany to attack first, right? I think that strengthens Germany\u2019s position in the west.  U.S. help in the form of Destroyers for Bases doesn\u2019t happen until September 1940 in the real history after Britain is expelled from the continent. Lend Lease doesn\u2019t happen until March 1941 in real life. So, neither of them nor U.S. aid would follow the same time frame. That means the Soviet Union is not receiving tanks, guns, food, etc. Britain is okay with this since they aren\u2019t being pounded but the Soviet Union could use that help as they relocate factories and shift manufacturing farther east. Does it have a significant impact? The best I can say is: maybe. The Russian people are fighting for their homes and burning everything they can\u2019t carry as they fall back. Even if Germany takes Moscow I doubt the Soviet Union sues for peace like the French. The Soviet Union had much stronger leadership than France had. That leadership was also much more focused. France fell divided in many ways. So, I don\u2019t think even if Moscow falls the Germans get anything more than Napoleon did.  There are a lot of variables here but I still think the timing of April and May mud season hurts Germany and helps the Soviet Union.

            "answer_text": "Firstly, in all likelihood Hitler would have waited until June and the end of the rasputitsa. But would he leave the western borders open and exposed to what was considered the biggest military power in Europe at that time? So Hitler gets word from an equivalent of Richard Sorge that the Western allies will not attack and he has a free hand in the east? That still leaves the question as to how it will take to build up his forces. Moving from the west to the east would take time and would also be noticed. Operation Barbarossa used a great deal of captured material, mainly vehicles. Granted that many were of dubious value and wore out quickly, but they still helped. In this scenario all that Germany has in the way of extra resources are those from Czechoslovakia. So Barbarossa goes ahead in early June 1940. Nothing happens in the west, so Germany has a free hand against a Red Army that has been weakened by the purges. But most likely the result is the same, not least because Hitler meddled with the plans, which in any case envisaged a three-pronged attack instead of a drive on Moscow. So the choices are that the German forces are stopped just before Moscow, as OTL, or they take Moscow, suffer heavy losses in street fighting, Stalin sets up somewhere in the Urals, and the battle continues in spring 1941 with Russia fighting a largely defensive war and the Germans suffering from increasing logistics problems as they try to press on east of Moscow. Would the western allies then attack at that point? They would have rearmed feverishly in the interim. One issue is that Italy most likely would not join in if France had not been defeated. France and Britain do not have to worry about the Mediterranean or North Africa, Greece is left alone.. ",

            "answer_text": "Does he make peace with the West? If the Phony war dies down and Germany attacks in 1940 there is a good chance that the Germans could take Moscow and the oil fields in the south. After that Germany and the USSR would be locked in a stalemate, with the Germans not being able to take the whole of Russia and the Soviets still having a large population and industry. It would be close. Also Italy would invade Greece and Yugoslavia successfully given that they could deploy their entire army to that task. ",

The key objective was capturing oil fields in Romania and the Causcasus Mountains. With that much oil, Hitler could have defended against Western Allies for many more years. Th next remaining question is whether France and England would have kept their troops west of the Rhine River?????? ",
