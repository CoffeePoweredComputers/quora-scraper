            "answer_text": "You have to first put in mind that the Philippines is an archipelago. We have more than 7,000 islands and it is a given that in these many regions, people had expressed themselves in writing differently, but this answer focuses mainly on the Manilas. In pre-colonial Philippines, literature was mostly written in an old script called \u2018Baybayin\u2019, originating from Brahmic scripts. It was used by Filipinos for writing mostly personal stories and poetry, and they wrote them on dried leaves, barks of leaves, and bamboo cylinders which were later burned by zealous Spanish missionaries who saw these insciptions as \u2018Pagan\u2019 or as \u2018works of the devil\u2019. Any conception that these records may have been preserved and conceived today had they not been burned by these Spanish missionaries is false. The medium of writing for most Filipinos is fallible and would not have been preserved even if the Spaniards had not discovered them. There are, however, some of these inscriptions still existing in jars and coins, for example. What is interesting is how many tales, epics, and even maxims had survived upto this day. Word-of-mouth accounts are what is widely accepted as the reason for these pieces of literature having survived in the first place, likely having solidarity as a revolt to contradictory elements in when the country was a Spanish colony. The Spanish missionaries tried to learn the local dialects of different regions so that they can teach Spanish, and hence eventually proselyte more effectively. It is thus no surprise that the first book to be printed in the Philippines was a prayer book Doctrina Christiana in 1593: written in Spanish with an accompanying Tagalog translation. Before moving on, a certain class division among the Filipinos must be understood. Ilustrados were learned Filipinos (mostly mestizos, or Filipinos who are mixed with Chinese or Spanish) who were mostly middle and upper middle class and were educated in Spanish; and there were the indios, or simply, the locals, or the natives. Indios, however, are generally seen as uneducated and the lowest in this class division. This prayer book was, however, not distributed to the public and was to be used only by these Spanish missionaries who nonetheless read them aloud to unlettered Indio catechumen, but having to translate other religious instructional materials meant that they had to employ native speakers as translators; and eventually, the native translator learned to read and write both in Spanish and in his native dialect. This development marked the beginning of Indio literacy and thus spurred the creation of the first written literary native text by the native. These writers would be called ladinos because of their fluency in both Spanish and Tagalog. Religious themes dominated the early years of Hispanic-Philippine literature, written in Tagalog and in Spanish. The first novel was not published until the late 17th century by Pedro Paterno, an ilustrado, but interestingly enough, in this novel Ninay, he chose to endeavour to highlight the endearingly unique qualities of Filipinos. Perhaps the most celebrated and most well-known Filipino writer of all time, Jose Rizal also wrote his novels around this time, and chose the realistic novel as his medium. His works were so influential not only among the locals, but as well as with ilustrados. Educated Filipino women also had produced significant literature in the form of poetry in this time. The cession of the Philippines by the end of the 17th century involved a payment of $20 million from the United States to Spain. Philippine literary production during the American Period in the Philippines was spurred by two significant developments in education and culture. One is the introduction of free public instruction for all children of school age and, two, the use of English as medium of instruction in all levels of education in public schools. Early Philippine literature in English would usually tend to imitate American models of writing, especially in the early years of American colonisation; however, there still remained poets and novelists who still wrote in Spanish somewhat as a way of professing pro-Spanish sentiments. There were also Filipinos, in the Visayas as well as in Mindanao, who had begun writing mostly poetry, but in their native dialects. It was only a matter of time, though, that Filipinos had somewhat become adept in writing literature in English. In 1925, Paz Marquez Benitez\u2019s short story, \u201cDead Stars\u201d (a personal favourite of mine, even) was published and was made the landmark of the maturity of the Filipino writer in English. Soon after Benitez, short story writers began publishing stories no longer imitative of American models. Thus, story writers like Icasiano Calalang, A.E. Litiatco, Arturo Rotor, Lydia Villanueva, Paz Latorena , Manuel Arguilla began publishing stories manifesting both skilled use of the language and a keen Filipino sensibility, some of their works even brilliantly inserting full and hearty English dialogue in the mouths of their native characters, as though English were their mother tongue in the first place. At present, there is little appreciation by the Filipino masses for what can be branded as \u2018good literature\u2019. It cannot be excused, nevertheless, that there is a moderate consumption of rather commercial literature among the masses, in the form of short romance paperbacks, usually in Tagalog, or a mix of Tagalog and English called Taglish, short horror paperbacks, or paperbacks with comedic social themes that are usually published in series. It might also be said, however, that the market for these genres are declining, as most are turning to internet media of literature such as Wattpad. Most middle-class and upper-middle-class Filipinos now admire and consume popular Western literature, despite the fact that there are quite many brilliant Filipino writers both in English and in Tagalog at present. To name a few, perhaps to cater your apparent need or want or not at all to read Filipino writers, I would suggest Nick Joaquin, poet Jose Garcia Villa, and of course Paz Marquez Benitez\u2019s \u201cDead Stars\u201d. This was my first answer ever. I hope to answer more!

            "answer_text": "If one is to be straightforward about it,I would say that the history of literature in the Philippines is practically almost lost. I meant this as before the Spanish occupation. Based on what I have read since I was a child, our early literature were mostly in forms of poems,songs which were not transcribed but passed by mouth generations to generations. Although an early writing system and alphabet existed- the alibata and the baybayin- it was not until thousand of years late\u0155, when the Spaniards came- that anything about these songs and poems were chronicled. Undoubtedly,these songs and poems which survived were not in their purest, unadulterated forms. I will try to post examples and pictures next time. ",
