            "answer_text": "\u201cThe Moon landing was fake!\" \u201cThe Earth is actually flat!\" \u201cIlluminati secretly rules the world!\" And now \u201cIndia is still a British colony!\"  No. NOOO! I'll put a rest to all arguments one by one: \u201cIndia is a part of the Commonwealth\u201d The confusion primarily arises from the fact that India is a part of the Commonwealth, so I'll just put this to rest once and for all. The Commonwealth is an organisation made up of former British colonies, which is led by the British monarch. That does not mean that the countries are ruled by the British monarch. It only means that this organisation, this club of voluntary participants, is presided over by the British Monarch. Compare this to the UN. The current General Secretary of the UN is Antonio Guterres, a Portugese politician and diplomat. Does that mean that Portugal rules the world or that Antonio Guterres is the ruler of the world? No, right? Being part of the Commonwealth is like being a member of a neighborhood kitty party. It has no bearing on the decisions you make in your own home. Only difference is that the head of this kitty party is fixed and does not change. The Commonwealth is a tooth-less cultural organisation that organizes meets and sports events. So why is India a part of it? Simply because after decolonization, it brought together new English speaking and developing nations facing similar challenges on a common platform and provided them an opportunity to expand relations and diplomacy. It\u2019s the same as being a part of BRICS, SAARC, ASEAN and UN. The only difference between other organizations and the Commonwealth is that the member presiding over these meets does not change. \u201cIndia became a Dominion in 1947\u201d True. But we became a Republic in 1950, did we not? Have people forgotten what Republic Day is all about? India became a Dominion, so that it can work on forming it's own constitution. But the country cannot be law-less until that is done right? So British law was still applicable, until the constitution was drafted. Once that was done, the Indian Constitution became the only law of the land. The actions of the UK legislative have had no bearing on Indian laws thereafter. \u201cIndia kept following British laws after Independence\u201d Just answer this question - if murder was illegal under British rule, should it not have been illegal under home rule? Drafting of the constitution used a lot of British made laws, simply because it was practical. The Indian Penal Code was used just as it was, because it did not make sense to change each and every crime and punishment at the time. The Consitution had bigger matters to deal with, like of structure of the Government, the powers of Central Government, State Governments, the President, Governors, the Supreme Court, High Courts, Cabinet, Parliament, what rights should the citizen have, how would government exercise its power, etc. This was a very complex task that required a lot of vision and discussion. They could not have been bothered with what should be the punishment for stealing rice or selling weed. In programming terms, they used pre-existing libraries to make their process efficient. Since then, the Indian constitution and British contitution have grown apart. Britain decriminalized homosexuality in 1967, India did so in 2018. India has a reservation system, Britain never did. Closing Arguments India decides it's own foreign and military policy. It decides who becomes her ally and who it fights with. Had British ruled India, would they have allowed Communist Russians to become India's key ally? Has India ever been obliged to fight any of the wars British fought later? In Falklands, Suez, Northern Ireland, Gulf War, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq or Cyprus? Indian Prime Minister is elected by the people of India. The President is elected by the Indian legislative bodies. The Chief Justice is appointed by the Indian President. Indian currency is backed by Reserve Bank of India and the Governor of RBI is appointed by the Cabinet. Indian military chiefs are appointed by the President. The CAG, Police, IB, EC, CVC, all powerful offices are appointed by order of Indian President. Our elected Ministers decide how the economy runs, what we import, what we export and from whom. So what power exactly does Britain have over us today? Can the conspiracy theorists please answer this one question? Conclusion Some people love to think that they have discovered some hidden secret others have missed. In the age of internet, any crackpot can publish his delusional crap and find a few supporters. Just ignore these nutjobs and have faith that not everyone has been lying to you all your life. If India really were a British colony, trust me, they would have made their presence felt. Jai Hind. ",

            "answer_text": "The answers given by other Quora users are enough to answer your question. I will just add a bit from my side. On and from the 15th day of August, 1947, India became an independent dominion vide the Indian Independence Act passed by the British Parliament. With this, His Majesty(the ruler of England)'s rule in India ended. This was what is the primary misconception I found in most of the other answers. They remarked that even after independence, India remained a mere dominion under British crown, which is completely a fallacy on their part. As the act itself clearly rules out all possibilities of the Crown exercising sovereignty over India. The Act vouchsafed absolute supremacy to the legislature of the erstwhile Dominion of India. The Legislature had the power to amend or repeal all acts passed by the British Parliament upto the date of enactment of the said Act, including the said Act itself. The Ruler of England(in his seperate capacity as Monarch of India) could only at most appoint the Governor-General for the dominion who shall hold office to the pleasure of the Dominion Legislature. Even this power surceased when India became a Republic on the 26th day of January, 1950, as the Constitution of India, being the supreme law of the land, repealed the Government of India Act, 1935 and the Indian Independence Act, 1947. Coming to your question as to why Queen Elizabeth II was allowed to visit India without a visa, I might inform you that so long as you are a President or a Monarch of a country, you do not require a Passport to visit a foreign country, since in the passport of all countries, there is a note requesting and requiring in the name of the President or Monarch of that country to allow the bearer of that passport to pass freely without let or hindrance and to allow him all necessary assistance in case of need. Now thinking logically, a President or a Monarch cannot make such request on his own Passport. So, don't worry about the sovereignty of our nation, we are now the fastest growing economy of the world and are self-dependent in most spheres. Also, it was India which introduced the idea of a Republic within the Commonwealth(by pressurizing the United Kingdom to rename the British Commonwealth of Nations to the Commonwealth of Nations, which was materialized by way of the London Declaration of 1949, which itself was drafted by an Indian), which many countries followed. If it had been then a British colony, how could it have exerted influence over its Sovereign? Thanks for the A2A. ",
