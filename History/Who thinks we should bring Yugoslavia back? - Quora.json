            "answer_text": "Not many   The socalled Kingdom of the Serbians, Croatians and Slovenians, later called Yugoslavia, was a totally new creation by France and Serbia with the consent of America\u2019s mr. and mrs. Wilson. It was a failure although Regent Paul was the last one to keep it afloat. The Serbians deposed him and Germany and Italy finished YugoSlavia off.  His royal Highness, Prince Paul at his wedding, Ruritarian style After World War Two, probably at the request of comrade Stalin, Yugoslavia was revived. His onetime buddy, the Communist Tito took over, had the upper strata of society as well as unwellcome minorities killed and created the not so happy People\u2019s Republic of YugoSlavia. When Tito died in 1980 things started to fall apart. First slowly, then very fast. At least a decade ago there was a TV documentary and the keeper of a Tito Museum was interviewed. He was rather old and so were his friends. Two kinds of people want Yugoslavia back: a. The diehard Communists who think the People\u2019s Republic had a sacred duty to the downtrodden of the earth. Blah, blah, blah. In none of the half a dozen states of former Yugoslavia there are many Communists left. So they are a dying breed.  Serbian Empire, greatest extent 1358; did not last long. I do not see Slovenia in it.. b. The hypernationalist Serbians who think Serbia has a divine duty to oppress other people. Nonsense because none of the medieval Serbian Kingdoms ever reached as far as Slovenia. They did include Bosnia and even Bulgaria as vassals for a short time, however.  Prince Lazar, leader of the Serbians during the Battle of Kosovo 1389 They even cite their disastrous Battle of Kosovo against the Ottoman Turks..With an enormous veneration of medieval Kings and Princes. No problemo, just do not exaggerate. So the chances at seeing again a Zombie State of YugoSlavia are slim indeed. Too much bad blood.. To get Yugoslavia back one needs a powerful foreign backer. I do not think Putin is up to this task.. Anyhow Prince Paul was completely exonerated from guilt and now rests in the Royal Mausoleum. Yeah, the one and only YugoSlav.. RIP  Hope this answers the question.. ",

            "answer_text": "I do, but how about we doing it ourselves? Not some CIA, KGB nor MI6. When I say that, I am not referring to some Serbian monarchy nor Communist tyranny, as much as some idiots always stick that upfront in cynic manner. I am referring to regional economic and cultural integration, which could be a potential factor for further regional political unification, given potential favorable geopolitical circumstances. The first thing which would need to happen is a historical catharsis, which would follow after we all clean our backyards first. Given our Slavic and Illyrian behavioral characteristics and the influence of Dark Forces, that is a one tough project to look ahead for. ",
