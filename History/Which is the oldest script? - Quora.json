            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a tough question to answer because the line between a real script and a more limited set of symbols or tally-marks is pretty fuzzy. Egyptian hieroglyphs and Sumerian cuneiform are the top contenders for the title of oldest. Both of them transitioned from symbols and accounting tricks to writing systems that could express novel ideas in the last half of the fourth millennium BC (some time between 3500 and 3000). Probably the oldest example of symbols that were later used for writing is the Kish tablet from Sumeria, from right around 3500 BC. It is still using pictographs \u2014 not yet the true cuneiform writing which emerged a few centuries later \u2014 but the pictures are already conventionalized and are the direct ancestors of the simplified glyphs that became cuneiform writing.  Kish tablet, circa 3500 BC. Not yet writing, but will be soon. Photo: Wikipedia The same process is at work in these ivory tags from the tomb of the enigmatic early Pharaoh known as Scorpion I  Photo: HistoryOfInformation.com Again, these are not writing (you\u2019ll note they are all only one or two signs) but these images will become true hieroglyphic writing within a couple of centuries. There are a few examples of artifacts that might be writing but aren\u2019t deciphered so we can\u2019t be sure. The most famous case is that of the Vin\u010da symbols from the Balkans, which date back at to around 5,300 BC.  While they look like writing we have made little progress in deciphering them (it\u2019s extremely hard to decipher writing when you don\u2019t know what language the symbols represent). They might also be a proto-writing which never completed the transition to a full script. They do, however, predate both Egyptian and Mesopotamian writing by almost two millennia. ",

            "answer_text": "The Vin\u010da symbols, sometimes known as the Danube script, Vin\u010da signs, Vin\u010da script, Vin\u010da\u2013Turda\u0219 script, Old European script, etc., are a set of symbols found upon Neolithic era (6th to 5th millennia BC) artifacts from the Vin\u010da culture of Central Europe and Southeastern Europe. Vast majority of historians agree that those symbols are not a writing system, but private symbols or ornaments of some kind associated with Proto-Indo European Deities ( Pre-Vedic culture of Proto-Indo-Europeans). However these symbols could be possibly the oldest form of writing system invented by Proto-Indo-Europeans(Pre-Vedic Culture) which could have influenced origin of other earliest writing systems. Reference : Vin\u010da symbols - Wikipedia  The earliest writing systems evolved independently and at roughly the same time of Indus Valley, Egypt and Mesopotamia, but current scholarship suggests that Mesopotamia's writing appeared first. During the period 8,000\u20137,500 BCE, the Sumerian agriculturalists needed a way to keep records of their animals and goods. Small clay tokens were formed and shaped by the palms to represent certain animals and goods. As the clay tokens became difficult to store and handle, impressing the tokens on clay tablets became increasingly popular. Clay tablets were easier to store, neater to write on, and less likely to be lost. Impressing the tokens on clay tablets was more efficient but using a stylus to inscribe the impression on the clay tablet was shown to be even more efficient and much faster for the scribes. Writing system from Sumerians, emerged in Mesopotamia around 3500 BCE. The name \"Kushim\" is recorded on the Kushim Tablet shown below is an ancient (c. 3400\u20133000 BC) -Sumerian clay tablet recording some agricultural transactions.  Reference : Cuneiform - Wikipedia  Cuneiform or Sumerian cuneiform is one of the earliest systems of writing. It is distinguished by its wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets, made by means of a blunt reed for a stylus.  The original Sumerian script was adapted for the writing of the Semitic Akkadian (Assyrian/Babylonian), Eblaite and Amorite languages, the language isolates Elamite, Hattic, Hurrian and Urartian, as well as Indo-European languages Hittite and Luwian later. Cuneiform writing was gradually replaced by the Phoenician alphabet during the Neo-Assyrian Empire Reference : Cuneiform - Wikipedia Egyptian hieroglyphs \"came into existence a little after Sumerian script.Egyptian hieroglyphs were the formal writing system used in Ancient Egypt.Egyptian hieroglyphs developed into a mature writing system used for monumental inscription like Brahmi scripts.  If you look at evolution of alphabets from Egyptian hieroglyphs, things will be very clear. You can get these references for almost every alphabet we know in all scripts across the world as of today.   Coming back to Cuneiform scripts, Kings of the Mitanni state were of Indo-Aryan origin and a number of Indo-Aryan RigVedic gods (Mitra, Varuna, Indra, Nasatya) are mentioned in the Mitanni texts, alongside the indigenous gods.  Reference : Tushratta - Wikipedia Tushratta (Sanskrit Tve\u1e63a-ratha, \"his chariot charges\") was a king of Mitanni at the end of the reign of Amenhotep III and throughout the reign of Akhenaten\u2014approximately the late 14th century BC. Amarna letter EA 26 - Wikipedia Amarna letter EA 19 - Wikipedia  The Hittite archives of \u00c0attu\u0161a\u0161have revealed the oldest known horse-training manual. Several Indo-Aryantechnical terms for horse training are mentioned in this manual: aikawartanna \u2018one turn (of the course)\u2019 (Sanskrit eka-vartana-), terawartanna \u2018three turns\u2019, panzawartanna \u2018five turns\u2019 (Sanskrit pa\u00f1ca-),sattawartanna \u2018seven turns\u2019 (Sanskrit sapta-), and nawartanna (for nawa-wartanna) \u2018nine turns\u2019 (Sanskrit nava). The first time historically the word Ratha is used as chariot is around 1650BCE with the Hurrians of the Middle East. These Hurrian's had hundreds of Vedic Sanskrit loan words. (Assuwa) is name of an Anatolian landscape in Hittite.  If we closely observe ancient scripts, we can find clear relation on how they have arrived based on different mediums used while writing on Clay tablets, Stone and Palm-leaf manuscripts later. Phoenician alphabet was easier to write in Stone and later scripts found place in Palm leaf to be easier. Ancient Persians adapted Cuneiform writing. Indo Iranian( Indo-Aryan) and Sanskrit spoken languages appears very similar and below is pronunciation of Behistun inscriptions from cuneiform (one of oldest forms of human writing system)   Correct way to read old Persian is as below and sounds similar to Sanskrit /Avestan pronunciation:  Indus valley civilization writing appeared around 2600 BCE and these scripts shown below have very close resemblance to Proto-Elamite writing of Mesopotamian's. Below is Stone Age carvings of Edakkal caves in Southern India show representation of Sun God at many places and many believe probable links with Indus valley civilization based on proto-Indus scripts used and also proto-Elamite scripts that of Elamite civilization(Iran).  Like Proto-Elamite, even Indus script has not yet been completely deciphered, but efforts are ongoing and I have tried from my side too with assumption below from few proto-elamite symbols, few from Egyptian hieroglyphs and few proto-sinaitic scripts including Brahmi scripts.   During 3rd century BCE of Emperor Ashoka\u2019s regime, most of his inscriptions in rock pillars were Brahmi script which is one of the most important writing systems in the world those days and further some of the earliest historical inscriptions found in India. Most importantly, it is the ancestor to hundreds of scripts found in South, Southeast, and East Asia.Below is Brahmi rock inscriptions of Ashoka around 3rd Century BCE (300\u2013200 BCE)  Did Brahmi come from Indus script? Brahmi script appears to have actually come from mixture of Indus script along with few of proto-Sinaitic scripts.Most scholars believe that Brahmi was likely derived from or influenced from Sinaitic scripts and Indus scripts, however some scholars in India reject the idea of foreign influence. If we take our first alphabet \u201ca\u201d, it appears that there is very clear relation with proto sinaitic signs and more such examples are covered below.   Below are some of beautiful data that I collected from Internet (Wikipedia) and few photos from respective temples or historical places.Look at the evolution of all Tamil scripts from Brahmi from those days till current form.  Below is evolution of Kannada-Telugu scripts from Brahmi to current form  ",
