            "answer_text": "The Scythians were one of the biggest threats to Persian stability. These ancient Steppe peoples were an empire with little infrastructure, so they were rarely threatened by outside forces. In the wars with the Scythians, the Persians took heavy losses. Rather than annex their whole empire, Darius I instead chose to only annex parts of the Caucasus and leave the rest in the Steppe, as building a satrapy in that territory would be a waste of resources and highly dangerous. As for the Greeks, the Balkans were the only things keeping the Scythians from major contact with them. Of course the Hellenic states that broke apart after the death of Alexander would deal with the Scythians much more often, the mainland Greeks would rarely communicate with them. Of course the Greeks would flex their muscles in any interaction (Not hard with the Macedonians being the main contact and a strong navy), but they always kept their distance. We have a few philosophers acknowledging them and showing them much respect, but many other philosophers showing the opposite. ",

            "answer_text": "It mostly varied from region to region, at least for the Greeks. Many philosophers, like Plato, while they termed Scythians as fierce and warlike, they admired their way of life and even acknowledged the presence of philosophers, like Anacharsis. Others, like the historian Herodotus, had more negative views vis-a-vis the Scythians. The Persians, however, viewed them as an enemy and an obstacle for their path toward world domination. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming you mean the Skythians (sometimes written as \u2018Scythians\u2019) then largely as rather dangerous northern barbarians. Curiously, the police force in classical Athens, such as it was, was composed of Skythian mercenaries. They were also a major feature of both Achaemenid Persian armies, and the armies of many of Alexander\u2019s successors. ",
