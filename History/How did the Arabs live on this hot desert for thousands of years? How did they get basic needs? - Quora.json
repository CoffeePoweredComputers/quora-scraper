            "answer_text": "First of all, when you are in the desert, there are three very important things you need to take care of, water, food, and protection from the elements, when people hear the word desert they think unending lands of sand, but what they do not know is that the possibility of an oasis growing up in the desert is very large, this is a picture of an oasis  Oases varies in size, they can be tiny, Medium and even Large, Arab societies grow around an oasis. Second, there used to be two types of Arab groups in the past, Bedouin Arabs and City Arabs, Bedouin Arabs usually belonged to a single clan, they were always on the move, they lived in tents, and moved from one oasis into another when water was depleted, and moreover, they were usually at war with each other for resources, City Arabs on the other hand are the lucky ones, as they have found an oasis with a deep water wells, which means infinite amounts of drinkable and agriculture water, city Arabs are usually several clans unlike the Bedouin Arabs, which in turn forms a Tribe, and live in houses and even small castles made of hardened Mud, alongside agriculture, they turn their city into a trading hub. Talking about trading, this is the ancient road of trading in the Arab world  (Nabataean Kingdom trading route with other Arabs, the Nabataeans are a very old Arab kingdom)  (This is another one, its true that the names are of modern states, but these are for the old trading routes) As you can see, they were not disconnected from the outside world, these trading hubs were Arab cities, which Non-Arab convoys, and even Bedouin Arabs traded in, that is how Arabs got the materials they could not find in the desert, moreover, Africa was not always in Turmoil, for example on the opposite side of Arabia on the African side there used to be a powerful African kingdom called The Kingdom of Aksum  ",

            "answer_text": "Same question could be said to the Eskimos of the Northern Pole. Two environmentally extreme places to live in. But in both, people have their cumulative experience through many many generations in how to survive/how to protect themselves from the harsh environment. In the Arabian Penninsula; As long as they find water well, life can be possible around. Palm trees provide \u201cdates\u201d, very nutritional/healthy meal rich in carbohydrates and minerals. Their sheep provide the milk they need as protein. They used to live in tents, easy to be carried from a place to another if their water well gets dry. The tough environmentally rigid Camel with extraordinary ability to live with least water/food for days was their main transportation mean from place to another. That simple life style was their secret to survive in a hot melting weather. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for your question. I would suggest doing some research on the Bedouins. Keep in mind, much of desert life centers on the camel. Moreover, not all of the Arab world is on a desert. There is also the sea. Not to mention, the marshes. See Wilfred Thesiger\u2019s book Marsh Arabs for details about how Marsh Arabs lived in Iraq. Much of their lives centered around the water buffalo rather than the camel. ",
