            "answer_text": "My pick would be Gobekli tepe.. Situated at the top of a mountain ridge in the Southeastern Anatolia region of modern-day Turkey these monuments are believed to be as old as 12,000 years. To get an idea of how old these are they precede the stonehenge by 7,000 years.  Their age creates a huge problem as to who built them and why, because there is no record of any existing civilization that was capable to carry out stone works of such magnitude and scale. It is believed at that time period humans were still in the hunter gatherer stage, and for them to erect such monuments is nothing short of extra ordinary.  Many believe this is where human civilization and organized religion first started, a clear shift from hunter gatherer to pastoral and agricultural society. The genes of first cultivated grains by humans come from vicinity of that area and support this theory.  Archeologists are divided as to the purpose of these monuments. But one thing is for sure, they will re write the human history. picture credit: national geographic Gobeklitepe - The World's First Temple near Sanliurfa, Turkey ",
