            "answer_text": "Since I'm the first to answer this thread, I will go with the absolutely most famous (six) couples: The Six Wives of Henry VIII King Henry VIII of England was married to Catherine of Aragon.  Being a king he couldn't keep it in his pants, so had an affair first with Catherine's lady-in-waiting May Boleyn, and then her sister Anne Boleyn.He couldn't get a divorce through the pope, so he chucked the Catholic Church out of England, established the Anglican Church, and got his divorce. He got a daughter (the future Queen Elizabeth I), but no son. Due to some court machinations by Cromwell, Anne ended a head shorter after some charges of treason. Next on his list was Jane Seymour, who sadly died after a year of marriage.  Wife number four was Anne of Cleves. This was not a match made in heaven, so only lasted for seven months. Henry annulled the marriage and moved on.  Catherine Howard was the next little flower to be deflowered by the king. A flimsy story about some treason a year later, and it's \"off with her head\" in the best Red Queen style.  His sixth and last wife was Catherine Parr. This Catherine managed to outlive Henry, even if only for about a year. ",

            "answer_text": "Victoria and Albert. We're often a little too quick to dismiss \"the Victorians\", but give these two their due. As Consort of the Queen under a constitutional monarchy, Albert was a diligent liberalizing and modernizing force. Although he lacked the title of King, he performed the role better than many who did. He was a key opponent of slavery. They had nine children together, and after Albert's untimely death, Victoria wore mourning garb for the rest of her life. (I think they really loved each other.) Victoria continued the tradition of playing the conscientious monarch until the end of her life in 1901. Her life coincided with the zenith of British power and prestige. Her children and grandchildren were to fill out much of the cast of the world war that sat on the horizon. ",
