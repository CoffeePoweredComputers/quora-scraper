            "answer_text": "The Euro currency was physically introduced into Ireland on 1st January 2002 although it had come into being on paper only a few years earlier with all banking transactions being given in both Punt and Euro. When the idea of a common currency was first introduced in the early 1990's, it was first called the ECU or European Currency Unit. This was later changed to Euro. On its similtaneous release into the Euro Zone on 01/01/02, both Euro and Punt were acceptable currency for 6 weeks in all Irish shops and outlets with all change being given in Euro. This led to much confusion with it being possible to enter a shop, make a small purchase, hand in a 20 and get close to 30 in change!!! ",
