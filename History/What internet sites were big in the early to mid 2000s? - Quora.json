            "answer_text": "Google didn\u2019t hit big until 2003. Prior to that, there was no one search engine, there were dozens of competing search engines, and word went around the growing internet community of which was best at finding relevant results. It was often a case of selecting the right search engine for the kind of content that you wanted. The big sites of the day were Portals; these functioned as link aggregators for services, both those offered by the Portal owner and those offered by third parties and individuals. More than half of a website\u2019s hits came from these central hubs; it was not uncommon for a search engine result to lead you to a new hub, devoted to, or specializing in, a topic that was of interest to you. Search engines were one of the services hanging off Portals; you often didn\u2019t go to a search engine\u2019s website, you performed your search within the confines of the Portal, and it led you to a more specialized portal. At that time, I was an occasional contributor to a magazine that reviewed web sites. There was no capacity to preview search results; you rarely even got the page\u2019s title, just the url, and those were usually far from plain English. There was no such thing as page optimization, and just about every graphic element had to be hand-made by the site owner - and the modem speeds of the day meant that not everyone would see graphics, anyway, and there were serious limits on the number that could be displayed even if you could see them, or the page would take forever (20 minutes plus) to load. Similarly, if you had an advert on your page, it was a Big Deal. There were few rogue elements in terms of malware. That sort of thing generally lurked in the un-indexed part of the internet, beyond the portals and search engines, accessed only by those foolish enough to blindly click on a link that sounded interesting in an unsolicited (spam) email. Stick to the sources you knew, and such problems were a rare event. Which meant that there was an expectation of safety, wherever you went, online - the sort of expectation that you have as a tourist in the brightly lit tourist attractions in the middle of the day. So the times were a lot more innocent. These days, browsing the web is still like being a tourist - but one venturing into the rough side of town and trying to avoid the shadows, because you never know what\u2019s lurking within them. An expectation of safety has been replaced with an expectation of threats. Web traffic is far more direct, from search engine to website, and less from website to website. And those were, ultimately, all the portals were - websites with links to interesting places on the internet. Google killed the portals in the middle of the decade by becoming the ultimate portal. It\u2019s ironic, but Google itself is still an old-style portal in a lot of ways - just click on the right symbol on the search engine\u2019s front page to access everything from Google Translate to the latest News headlines. A little vestige of the old days survives there. Thanks for the chance to reminisce, Steve :) ",
