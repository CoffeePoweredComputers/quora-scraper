            "answer_text": "The terms \u201cfar left\u201d and \u201cfar right\u201d are somewhat ambiguous, as this only refers to extreme ends of the spectrum of economic views (from collective to private), rather than a spectrum social views, which ranges from totalitarianism, to anarchism. All of this is ostensible of course, as some may claim that their views are the true form for freedom, or individualism, or collectivism ect, and some may say that the views of someones far away from them on the political spectrum, may be ultimately different in some way to what they are describing. Nonetheless, here are some channels of interest to the OP. I have organised them into the extremes of far left (authoritarian) far right (authoritarian), and far left (libertarian), and far right (libertarian). This is how the views of the channels are normally described by adherents of the world view or ideology. For more information on the political spectrum check out the The Political Compass website (the test isn\u2019t very good IMHO). Far left (authoritarian): TheFinnishBolshevik ProSocialism Tovarishch Endymion Far right (authoritarian): Black Pigeon Speaks The Golden One Paul Joseph Watson Far left (libertarian): Libertarian Socialist Rants stimulator Chomsky's Philosophy Far right (libertarian): ReasonTV Stefan Molyneux The Liberty Network You will find many links on these channels to related channels or other channels of interest. i would caution against even moderate reliance on you tube for news and commentary however, the level of discussion can be quite poor, and the herd mentality of people within their various \u201cbubbles\u201d can be quite distracting. I would also like to say that a better way of finding out about these ideologies and world views, would be reading broadly in political literature, but failing that, you may find lectures on you tube from a number of authors from across the political spectrum. But, just to reiterate, you tube can be quite a rabbit hole of political extremes and poor quality discussion, i would try not to get lost in it. ",
