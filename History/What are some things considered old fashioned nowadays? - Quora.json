Source: Google I am a 90\u2019s kid and I feel so fortunate to be a part of this transition of manually driven to technology friendly world. Though technology has done wonders for humans, but it also snatched that emotional touch and happiness of writing letters or even sending cards on special occasions. My cousin sister and I used to send handwritten letters and cards to each other telling about what is happening in our life and especially how our summer vacations are going on. We always used to discuss our meetings and games to be played. Not only this, every year, on my birthday, she used to send me a hand made birthday card with compliments and wishes. Now, we wish each other on WhatsApp or calls. Well, according to me, it shows efforts put in my the person in this busy world. I still give handwitten letters to my friends, family once in a while and I used to write letters to my boyfriend. Infact, I have written a breakup letter to my ex too! \ud83e\udd2d I know it's crazy, but it's fun! Writing your heart out in a handwritten form is the best therapy. So, don't you miss that feeling of recieving the handwritten letter or even writing to your loved ones? Thanks for reading! \ud83d\ude00 ",
