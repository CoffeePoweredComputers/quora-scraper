            "answer_text": "Rome fell and so will America.  America is suffering from imperial overreach, increasing factionalism, incipient fragmentation into regionalism and a profound change in demographics.  Like Rome in the 2nd century - at the peak of its power, America suffers from decreasing economic productivity, erosion of its middle class and an increase in superstition. Rome fell because by the end of the first century A.D., there were very few Romans left.  For sure, in the Latin West, Spaniards, Gauls, Africans had been Romanized and there had been many Italian colonists.  It is no accident that after the Flavians (Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian) and Nerva, there are really no more Roman or Italian emperors.  The same was true of the military where provincials dominated the leadership.  Why was this?  Because the Roman, Latin, Italian small freeholding peasantry had died out and had become either proletariat in the cities or bonded servants or slaves in latifundia.  This in turn was due to highly aristocratic governments lacking much interest in the welfare of any but rich city dwellers.  Sound familiar?  In the United States, the legislature is the captive of monied interests and the Executive is also effectively purchased.  The American middle class is disappearing and with it the mores that once made America prosperous.   As early as the late 2nd century, Rome's borders had become porous.   Germans and Samartians (an Iranian people) were infiltrating across the Rhine and Danube frontiers.  Something similar is happening to the United States right now.   Rome took a long time to fall.  External threats were mostly mastered in the 3rd and 4th centuries (until, say, 376 and the Battle of Adrianople).  But the cost was huge: maintaining the army led to increasing taxes that sapped the economy, especially the municipal elites.   The American federal government with its imperial military is essentially bankrupt and has been financed for years with debts that ultimately must be paid.  The easiest way to repay such debts is to destroy their real value with inflation.  Ultimately, current low American inflation must give way to much high rates.  In Rome, the constant currency devaluations were a similar response.  Constant inflation and debasement of the currency destroyed much real wealth and left the empire ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of the late 4th century. I see America gradually declining of America over the next 50 years and the loss of much of its world influence.   Then I see an accelerating decline and the replacement of a moribund republic with a dictatorship.  As in Rome, a strong man on horseback will be preferred to a dysfunctional government.  The dictatorship will be opposed and successfully challenged by certain sectional alignments and the United States will fragment and be replaced by a number of successor states.  Long before this happens,  Americans will be a polyglot people, with only distant memories of a heroic past and few will mourn its demise. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. And I can tell you when; But first an answer to your question..The answers on this page give the very reason - They view our demise from a political, environmental, financial, philosophical, and military perspective, etc; But are ignorant of the fact that God raises up nations, and brings them down to dust..None of the many answers mention the Bible's prophesies concerning America. Apparently because they are unknown to the intellectuals who answered here; But the prophesies about us are many - found in places like Jeremiah 50 & 51; In Revelation 17 & 18; In Nahum 3: In Isaiah 18, and so on..Our Biblical monikers include - 'spiritual Babylon', 'The great whore that sits upon many waters', 'A destroying mountain', and 'the Hammer of the Whole Earth'..The thing is, we will fall as Rome did, because just as God was forgotten in Rome and license reined, so has God has been forgotten in the United States, and license reins. He is forgotten out of hand, along with his commandments, His precepts, and His praise..It's very interesting and unfortunate, to see how everything that the Apostle Paul presciently prophesied of concerning men in our day and time, is characterized and caricaturized in the USA.2,000 years ago Paul wrote - \"In the Last days perilous times will come.\" Did he then describe wars, and famines, and weather events as the reason for the peril? No. He described what the character of man had devolved to; .Let's see if you think he was right - Paul wrote that in our day people would be:\"lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud,abusive,disobedient to their parentswithout love, without natural affection,unforgiving, false accusers (what 20th or 21st century war wasn't begun with a false accusation?) without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good,treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God\".Did he miss anything? I think not. And the United States could fill a book with anecdotal evidence of these traits..So, what will happen? We will go into captivity like all idolators do. Our land will be ravaged; Burned to the ground; It will shock the world; It will happen suddenly - the Bible says \"in one hour'. Our 'men' and 'leaders' will stand around clutching their hands and shaking.. helplessly watching our demise. Then just like Rome, we will never be an empire again. It's even worse than that. But it would take too much space here to go into detail..WHAT CAN BE DONE?You may ask: Is there anything that can be done? No. Nothing can be done; In 2017 God passed Judgment on the United States and its partner in crime, Israel - on the Day of Atonement that year.40 days prior to the Day of Atonement, both nations were subsumed into darkness at the same moment in time; The US with an eclipse, Jerusalem with sundown. That was God's sky telling us His timetable. The period between the eclipse and the Day of Atonement was a remarkable 40s - a Biblical number for judgment; We ought to have spent the 40 days examining our selves, weeping and fasting, and returning to God..Had God's people been watching the heavenly bodies- which God put up there to mark time; and mark events (Genesis 1:14) - as we ought to have been - they would have grasped the meaning of it all - and perhaps repented. Turning back to God. Neither nation did..The only thing remaining now is the execution of the sentence.WHEN ?When will it begin?The administration of President Trump gave us a 4 year grace period to put our affairs in order. There are 2 years remaining. If he completes his term. You'd do well to pray that he does..WHERE CAN I BE SAFE? A very good question.. and made both popular and profitable by the 'end time Prepping' community. But there is no such thing in the Bible. No one in Noah's day was saved by swimming lessons either.Answer: Safety is in Jesus Christ alone. .You need to belong to Him. He needs to be Lord of your life. He is the Lord of the Armies of angels, and he will protect his own. (I could write a book on how many times he sent them to my aid in this life. It's a spectacular event and gives one courage to write stuff like this down..How to make him Lord of your life? Open your mouth and call him Lord. Invite him into your life and heart. And believe that He is the Son of God, and that God raised Him from the dead. VIZ:\"For with the mouth confession is made unto salvation and with the heart man believes unto righteousness\". (Romans 10:9 & 10) There is still time, but not much...There is one thing that I need to add; The Lord has been painstakingly sending out warnings for many years. Generations even. He will not let the destruction come upon America unawares, without advance notice..He said so in Amos 3:7 - 'Surely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets [that they can warn the world]'..I can prove this verse to be true........ You have just been warned\".www the-Parallel-universe com ",
