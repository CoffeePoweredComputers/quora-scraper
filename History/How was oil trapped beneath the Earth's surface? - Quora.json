            "answer_text": "The majority of oil and gas formed in ancient marine basins. Erosion supplied streams and rivers with a continuous supply of sediment that made its way to the sea from the exposed continents. Organic matter drifted to the bottom of oceans and across continental shelves as organisms died and were buried. Layers of sediment built up and the heat and pressure of the overburden broke down and concentrated the organic material destined to become oil and gas.  As the physical environment changed, the crust became warped and broken to create specific trap styles that can be identified and targeted to extract hydrocarbons.  As the surface is eroded away or layers of earth were broken by new faults - the oil that was once trapped made its way to the surface. Oil seeps are common across the ocean floor and are visible around the world often appearing as tar pits like the famous La Brea pit in Los Angeles, CA.  The humble single-celled plankton that died eons ago accumulated on the ocean floor to provide the gasoline that powers the cars that drive around a sticky trap that captured 12,000-year-old Mastodons.

            "answer_text": "There are three general types of features which trap oil and/or natural gas below the surface of the Earth. The simplest to visualize is generally like an upside down bowl. Once some part of the oil and gas migrating from the source beds pass under the edge of the bowl, the bowl will fill to its spill point and the water under the oil and gas will keep it there. The second type of trap is a stratigraphic trap, where a reservoir layer is truncated and tilted up in such a way that the oil and gas cannot migrate along the thin edge and is trapped. The third type of trap is the combnation trap, where a truncated edge of the reservoir layer is crossing a geological structure like a half bowl or the edge of a bowl. Again all of the oil and or gas cannot migrate along the truncated edge. ",
