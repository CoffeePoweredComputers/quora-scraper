            "answer_text": "Nationalism as in \u201cGermany above all else\u201d[math]^{[1]}[/math] is almost dead for sure. Patriotism as in loving the own country and nation on the other hand has never died. I am a patriotic German myself after all. But don't be mistaken. Nationalism and Patriotism are not the same. The prior one propagates the mistaken idea of superiority over other nations while the latter may acknowledge that there is no certain order of superiority or inferiority, but still feel a connection to the own country and nation, and even prioritize the national interests over the interests of other nations. Nationalists may identify through DNA, looks, or even religion, a true patriot however doesn't need any of that and usually identifies through shared values and the shared connection, regardless of looks, religion, etc. A Muslim German for instance may be a patriotic German too as much as a Muslim American or Hispanic American can be a patriotic American. A Jewish German may be a patriotic German too, and indeed many Jewish Germans fought in WW I alongside other Germans, and many still are part of the Bundeswehr, for Germany is their country as much as it's mine after all. Nationalists may claim \u201clost territories\u201d such as Alsace and Lorraine, Silesia or Eastern Prussia and even go as far as causing diplomatic or military conflicts over their claims, a patriot however doesn't necessarily support any such claims, but will defend the own nation and its territorial integrity if in danger. The stress however is in defending and not attacking. Nationalism may be displayed through jingoistic songs, military parades, showing flags for other than national or international events, and such. Patriotism however doesn't require to be displayed as it is just about the person and how connected he feels toward the nation he identifies himself with. That said, we have both kind of people in Germany. For instance many of the people claiming to be \u201cpatriotic Europeans\u201d were in fact nationalists, some even Nazis. Hence no, nationalism is not dead at all, it still exists in Germany.  [1] this is not supposed to refer to the Deutschlandlied, but to the Nazi interpretation thereof ",

            "answer_text": "Obviously very nebulous question. What do you mean by \u201cdead\u201d or for that matter \u201cNationalism\u201d. Both the terms are interpretation based. German Corporate World is nearly 100% German, albeit non-EU citizens and Germans of migration origin are de-jure entitled to Labour Market equality.German firms are less likely to involve foreign vendors in their supply chain (except Chinese manufacturing, where massive cost cuts justify it). Even after a string of failed projects (Berlin airport, Stuttgart 21) Germans refused to hire foreign project management expertise (like Dutch experts who successfully upgraded Schiphol Airport). Similarly Spanish contractors quoting cheaper Autobahn maintenance offers where rejected in favour of German contractors.Germany focusses on unskilled migrations over point based skilled migration (e.g. USA, UK, Australia, Canada), and attempts up until last limit to train Germans (even with lower qualification), effectively de-facto \u201cGerman job for Germans\u201d.Slightly higher social welfare benefits are dished out to compensate for dogged refusal to implement Equal Opportunity Laws (let alone UK or US style Race Relations Law)Biggest flaw of AGG (Allgemeine Gleichbehandlungsgesetz) is that it has been conceptualised as ex-post-facto law, typical for criminal laws that kicks in after an incident has taken place, and not as ex-ante law - usual for regulatory laws - aims at preventing certain incidents. This transpires into AGG playing effectively NO role in mitigating discrimination; in fact to be enforced, the onus is entirely on the plaintiff to address the issue of discrimination, often at personal legal costs, no cover of anonymity, and further risk of retribution including counter legal threat as well as personal and reputation consequences. Basically a tokenism wherein discrimination is de-jure verboten, but de-facto very much allowed.Because of aforementioned reasons, German Turks have far lower social and economic attainment than British Indians or Canadian Chinese.Even city neighbourhoods with highest Left wing vote percentage are actually the least diverse parts, indicating German Leftist parties de facto follow a line of Conservative Socialism rather than Liberalism.All these are technically examples of hardcore Nationalism.
