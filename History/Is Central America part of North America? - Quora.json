            "answer_text": "It really depends on the conceptual framework of whoever you're asking. For example, to a geologist, they'd probably point out that the North American plate ends just south of the Yucatan peninsula, so Central America wouldn't be part of that.  But most of it also wouldn't be part of South America, either. Central America lies on the Caribbean Plate and the tiny Panama Plate.  This is why you probably want to ask a geographer, not a geologist. The former studies the social use of land, not the physical properties of the planet. And geography tends to include all of Central America as part of the North American Continent \u2014 the dividing line is where skinny Panama abuts wide Columbia. For completeness' sake, the part of North America north of Mexico is sometimes referred to as Anglo-America, although that term can also be used to explicitly refer to where English is the dominant language, meaning it would exclude francophone Quebec but include Belize as well as a few other small English-speaking areas. The approximate opposite of Anglo-America would be Latin America , where the dominant language is one of the Latin-derived Romance languages. Roughly speaking, that would usually be everything south of the United States, although there can again be ambiguities that might be important in specific contexts. ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends...on your definitions and points of reference: If we speak geographically, in respect to the EQUATOR (line that divides horizontally -not quite, but...ok-  the planet Earth into two halves, the upper one called northern hemisphere, the bottom one, southern hemisphere),  then yes, Central America is part of North America as is is located in the Northern Hemisphere. Now, if we talk geo-politically...they NO, Central America is  in Central America, it is NOT part of the North American classification...it is not part of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA,  only Canada, USA and Mexico), therefore, in this case NO, it is not part of  North America.
