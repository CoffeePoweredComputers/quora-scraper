            "answer_text": "There are three major sets of negative influences that the British had on India. Economical - They bled India dry, exploited Indian natural resources, market and labor while giving them minimal returns.Political - They started the divide and rule policy, effectively creating an enmity between Hindus and Muslims and fanned the narrative that the two communities cannot peacefully coexist. The paranoia was of course used by the Muslim Nawabs and feudal lords who like their Hindu counterparts (Maharajas and zameendars) did nothing for their commoners. The partition, at least the way it was implemented by the British is another example of a political blunder, the burden of which we still bear.Social - The British mistreated Indians, distorted their history and had them live as second class citizens in their own country for around 200 years. They believed that Indians were inferior to them and there are literally thousands of acts of atrocities that they had committed on Indians. People died in famines, British did not care, Indian soldiers died fighting battles for them, British did not reward. When they left, we were economically broke, socially divided, thousands of refugees on either side due to an ill managed partition. Luckily, for India we had secular leaders, who did not let the madness go on for much longer and luckily for India we joined NAM which paid back 30 years down the line.",

            "answer_text": "To be very precise, there are many, let me provide you the list as per my limited knowledge. Since the ancient times, British knew very well that Indian subcontinent is fraught with immense wealth ,because of trade links with Romans and Greeks , for example - Spices, Gems, textile was exported from India and exotic animals, girls and wine was in great demand in India. British wanted to establish monopoly over the entire trade business and India was central to the trade, Indian subcontinent provided them apt geo-strategic location from which they can control all Asian trade routes. So they gradually established British posts all over the subcontinent and managed to win over French, Dutch and Portuguese. The major impact was seen on India merchants which were now under control of the British :- So trade suffered.British by importing cheap machine manufactured goods into India :- smashed the market for Indian artisan and textile , so large no of people were jobless.British use to buy cheap raw material from India to export to their home country and due to complete monopoly no traders were allowed to sell this raw material to any other european regime :- control over market allowed them to set their prefered prices. :- huge financial losses bore by Indians.British Civil Servants (in India) and other officers were paid their exceptionally high amount of salaries and other remunerations from Indian Exchequer.Wars fought by British within and outside the Indian subcontinent were financed by Indian purse.80% of the British army in India was constituted by Indian Sepoys :- So almost all wars which British fought within India, with other european powers, were led by Indian Sepoys- Human Loss.Missionaries spread throughout the Indian Subcontinent - lured people to convert to christianity- almost entire North East India got converted into christianity - faded their unique culture, language, lifestyle, etc - Cultural lossThere are many more points but for that I have to reread certain things to provide you exact factual details.
