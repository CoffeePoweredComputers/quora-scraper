            "answer_text": "Hitler was definitely not doing Satan\u2019s work. Read the Talmud, Bible and Quran. You\u2019ll find in skimming through those lovely books that genocide is the favourite pastime of God, not Satan.  Not to mention the fact that many of the authors of the New Testament and Hadiths, who were among the most obsequious sycophants of the abrahamic god, had opinions about Jews that would make Hitler say: \u201cThat seems a tad anti-semetic\u201d. While I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say that Hitler was doing god\u2019s work, I think it would be fair to say that Hitler and the god of Abraham had similar visions for their perfect world. Besides the borderline libellous accusations of Nazi sympathy directed at our poor, unfairly maligned Devil, I completely agree with what Mike Muluk says in his answer. Though we come from different religions, I think we can both affirm that this modern idea of Hell being a place where Satan lounges on a throne while overseeing the torments of unrepentant sinners is a fantasy that is not supported by any Christian or Islamic scripture at all. I suspect, due in no small part to the influence of Dante Alighieri and John Milton\u2019s works on the contemporary collective psyche (at least in the western world), our image of Hell, and by extension the entire Christian and Islamic afterlife, is distinctly Hellenic. Not only were Dante and Milton\u2019s Hell\u2019s heavily influenced by Greek depictions of the afterlife, The Divine Comedy includes the appearances of various Greek gods and monsters in it\u2019s christian afterlife. And in Paradise Lost, Hell is actually called Tartarus, which, put simply, is not from Judaism. Now, in the defence of those legendary works of art: both had reasons for taking cues from Hellenism. The Divine Comedy was a comedy in the style of the ancient Greeks, and Paradise Lost was an epic that was written specifically to evoke Greek tragedy.both Christianity and Islam already had Greek influences on their views of the afterlife. Compare the Christian and Islamic idea of Heaven and Hell with the Jewish shoel, a state of a-consciousness that awaited both righteous and sinner alike.neither Dante or Milton portrayed Satan like Hades; as a brooding prince of darkness sitting upon a gilded throne. Satan in The Divine Comedy is a monstrous abomination, and Is eternally tormented, with half his body submerged in ice, and his three visages contorted in looks of pain and hatred. And while Milton\u2019s Satan retains some of his stature as the most beautiful and powerful angel in heaven, after his fall, he is still a far cry from his former self; the once leader of the Seraphim and left hand of god, relegated to wandering the earth and looking for small fires to start.  Above: depiction of Satan in The Divine Comedy Below: depiction of Satan holding court amongst the demons of Tartarus in Paradise Lost To put a long story short, this view of Satan is not supported by scripture. Now again, in defence of the modern view, what Hell is actually composed of is so scantily touched upon in Christian and Islamic scripture, that proto-christians and proto-muslims had to steal from the Greco Roman religion. There is no Hell in The Old Testament. So no help there.The New Testament refers to Hades, meaning the grave, moreso than it does Heaven or Hell. This is essentially the Christian version of shoel, mere unconsciousness after death that all are subject to.There is reference in the New Testament and Quran to Gehenna/Jahannam, which normally means god\u2019s cleansing fire. Gehenna in the New Testament is described as an unquenchable fire, and Jahannam in the Quran is described as Al-Nar, meaning the fire.There is a single line in the NT that describes Hell as a physical place, where \u201csinners are thrown\u201d.The Quran has more references to Al-Nar than to Hell, and while it\u2019s status as a physical place is slightly more explicit than in Christianity, it is still vague. Strangely, the Quran mentions that there are food sources in Hell, but otherwise, it is merely described as a fire which sinners will have to endure.Revelations and some versions of Islamic end-times prophecies describe a pit into which Satan has been or will eventually be thrown into. This unnamed pit is often interpreted by Christians and Muslims as Hell.Both Christian and Islamic scripture also tend to portray Satan as being quite lowly and pathetic, not as any kind of king. While the NT describes Satan as the Lord of the Earth and the God of this world, he is also portrayed as being repeatedly told off and being made a fool of. And in Islam, the Quran shows Satan as being constantly rebuked, cursed and banished by Allah. Satan has no throne in scripture. He\u2019s an ousted king grasping at power. As to whether Hitler is in heaven or not, that information lived and died with Hitler himself. Based on the New Testament, if Hitler was a true believer in Jesus, regardless of how many he murdered, he is in heaven. That\u2019s the unfortunate truth with Christianity. Good non-christians are thrown into Hell, while faithful murderers are snatched up into heaven. Islam is slightly more complicated. Hitler\u2019s admittance to the muslim heaven will be dependant both on if he sumbits to god, whether before or after death, and the nature of his actions in life. If he did more bad than good, he might be going to Hell. Hitler was completely irreligious as an adult. He maintained that Christianity was an integral part of Nazi ideology and German culture, but whether he himself was a faithful Christian is not known. He certainly wasn\u2019t devout, but his lack of outward religiosity is not enough to make him not a Christian. But if he was a true believer, Hitler may be up in heaven as we speak smoking a cuban with Jesus himself. They could be best buds for all we know. Or even closer than that\u2026  I wish to one day reach a level of irreverence when I can unironically write homoerotic Jesus-Hitler fan fiction. Edit: Before anyone yells at me for being a bigot, I am in no way, shape or form claiming that Christians and Muslims are sympathetic to Hitler\u2019s views, nor am I saying that the core ideas of the abrahamic religions espouse such things. I am not a christianophobe or islamophobe. ",

            "answer_text": "Heaven and hell do not work the way you are thinking. Both places are not anything like what our world is like here on earth. Heaven is about worshiping God (father son and holy spirit), and doing whatever He has prepared for us to do there. And hell isn\u2019t like a party place where people are walking around talking and doing things. No. Both places are based on sin, and whether or not you have had your sins forgiven. Every person ever born is a sinner, because we are born into a sinful world. Sin separates us from God because He is holy; and a holy God cannot be around sin, nor can it enter heaven. Gods word tells us that the wages of sin is spiritual death in hell, away from His presence forever. He does not want us to be separated from Him, so He sent Jesus in the flesh. Jesus\u2019 purpose was to die for mans sins, and His shed blood atones for our sin. He took our sin, and in return, He gives us His righteousness. When a person believes in Him, wholeheartedly, sincerely, with faith and fiduciary trust, it is then the person becomes born again (aka claiming salvation, being saved). The person has then had their sins forgiven, and the holy spirit comes to live inside the person. Salvation earns a person the right to enter heaven at death. If a person never has their sins forgiven, they will be denied entrance to heaven. [*side note: the holy spirit does not live inside everyone; He only lives in those who have been truly born again. He does not live inside of unbelievers] Hell on the other hand, is a place of eternal torment. People there are isolated\u2014completely alone and separated from others. Gods presence is not in hell, therefore it is cruel, merciless, pitch black, stench smelling, thick with smoke, and hot. Satan doesn\u2019t \u2018reward\u2019 or \u2018praise\u2019 people for doing evil things when they were alive\u2014he could care less. He only cares that a persons soul made it to hell so he and his demons can relentlessly torment them forever. People there are unbelievers who have not had their sins forgiven; or, they denied Gods existence, hated or rejected Him, or purposefully rebelled against Him during life. See, God gives everyone free will to make their own choices, because He does not ever force Himself on anyone. So by choosing to not accept Christ, the people in hell made their own choice in ending up there. They are fully conscience\u2014able to smell, taste, touch, feel and hear. 23 Minutes in Hell (8 Minute Version) | Soul Choice Ministries ",
