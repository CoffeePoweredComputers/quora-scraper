If he had pneumonia, and had just lain in bed sipping hot tea, there\u2019s at least a chance he\u2019d have recovered on his own. Doctors in those days tended to make things worse rather than better. ",

            "answer_text": "There was a doctor with a new medical treatment that would have saved Washington. Instead George went with the traditional treatment that killed him. Most doctors were quacks back then, and their patients survived only in spite of the medical treatment, not because of it. The body has some self healing properties that work even when quacks are trying to kill the patient. ",
