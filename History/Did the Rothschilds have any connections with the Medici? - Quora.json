That is too big a gap for much overlap. Of course, there are some descendants of the Medici running around. Some of them may be trying to hide their money from jealous ex-spouses. Others may be setting trust funds to keep their kids from blowing inheritances. This is the kind of business any trust bank - or private banking section -- would gladly perform for a high net worth customer. Thanks for the A2A, bartool. ",
