            "answer_text": "In my opinion with mixed feelings. Yes, there is regret that the conquistadors were greedy adventurers that had no qualms about killing people and subduing Native Americans with fire and sword and that they plundered Latin America of much of its wealth and that they enslaved Native Americans, began importing African slaves into the Americas (after the Native Americans died out) and established an exploitative colonial system that lasted several centuries, but by the same token there is a recognition of their pluck and personal bravery and admiration at the improbable way in which a few thousand men were able to cross vast oceans, impenetrable jungles, forbidding deserts, raging rivers and seemingly impassable mountain ranges to defeat millions of Native Americans and establish cities all over a huge continent on the ruins of Native American empires like the Aztecs, the Mayas and the Incas. I think there\u2019s also a lot of pride in that the conquistadors spread Spanish culture all over the world (even to the Philippines, Guam and the Mariana Islands in the Pacific) and in the manner in which that culture was so firmly established in the Americas that Hispanic peoples throughout Latin America are still recognizably Spanish culturally speaking and still speak the very same language that Spaniards speak. I believe that\u2019s the reason why movies and TV shows about Spanish exploits in the 16th and 17th centuries remain enormously popular in Spain. Witness, for example, the huge popularity of the historical fiction books written by Arturo P\u00e9rez Reverte in his \u201cCapit\u00e1n Alatriste\u201d series which, though set in Europe and mostly if not entirely in the 17th century, portray characters that are clearly based on the flesh and blood conquistadors of the 16th and 17th centuries. Arturo P\u00e9rez-Reverte - Wikipedia Captain Alatriste - Wikipedia Alatriste - Wikipedia  The 2006 film \u201cAlatriste\u201d was a huge box office hit and Vigo Mortensen (who speaks fluent Spanish among several languages) played the lead character.  Spanish TV and cinema are full of productions set both in Spain and in the Americas in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries and the people and events of those days are portrayed quite accurately from a historical perspective, warts and all, but mostly in a positive light. I must add that even though Spanish actors and actresses have always been very good and some of the best have even ventured into American movies (Antonio Banderas, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Javier Bardem, etc.), Spanish filmmakers and TV producers have become just as good at their craft and now routinely produce movies and miniseries that are very technically accomplished and have nothing to envy Hollywood in terms of scripts, plot lines, cinematography, filming techniques, sound editing, visual editing, soundtracks and/or special effects. I must also clarify that I feel qualified to answer this question because even though I was born in Puerto Rico in 1961 and am a natural born US citizen my four great grandfathers came from Catalonia, Extremadura, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands in the mid to late 19th century and my family has kept an uninterrupted correspondence with distant relatives in Spain (whom we have also visited occasionally) since my great grandfather Jos\u00e9 Barquero, a native of Badajoz in Extremadura, was posted to Puerto Rico (where he died a US citizen in 1923) as a Spanish soldier in 1893.

            "answer_text": "Most people simply \u201cdon\u2019t view\u201d them. They\u2019re not a part of common public discourse, just because they\u2019re \u201cancient history\u201d from a Spain that no longer exists. If you just stop an average Spaniard in the street and ask him/her, most of them will be initially befuddled and, after checking that it isn\u2019t a hidden camera stunt, you\u2019ll get a vague response \u2014because the view about them is vague, except for a few highly-politized individuals. The old people who were raised during Francoism will basically be divided in two: those who bought the \u201cConqueror-hero\u201d mythology that Francoism exploited going back to the Visigothic Kings and Don Pelayo, and those who will tell you, \u201cyeah, that\u2019s what we were taught, but now I know it was all BS.\u201d None of them will recall many details, for most of them it is just \u201csomething that you learnt at school.\u201d If you ask younger people, it\u2019s even more \u201csomething that you learnt at school\u201d, but in democratic times, so no ultra-national-Catholic indoctrination, just \u201cthe lesson of the week.\u201d After the exam, you mostly forget about it. It is no longer a part of our identity, it has close-to-zero relation with modern Spain and its issues, it arises no emotion except among a bunch of highly-politized individuals of both sides of the aisle. For the rest of us, including those of us who are interested in History, they\u2019re just ancient guys doing ancient stuff like the Tercios de N\u00e1poles or the Comuneros de Castilla who, BTW, hit slightly closer to home. Most often, the Conquistadores are not even our great-grandparents. Most of them stayed in America, so they\u2019re the great-grandparents of Americans. The famed \u201cAmerican gold\u201d (way more often silver) didn\u2019t mean anything to the average Spaniard even back in the time, they were as poor as ever or more, it was all appropriated by the kings and oligarchs, often to pay their huge debts. The famous poet and playwright Francisco de Quevedo wrote, nace en las Indias honrado / donde el mundo le acompa\u00f1a; / viene a morir en Espa\u00f1a / y es en G\u00e9nova enterrado, meaning, [\u201cSir Money\u201d , \u201cthe gold\u201d] is honorably born in the Indies / where all the world is with him; / he comes over to die in Spain / and in Genoa he gets his burial. Genoa was a powerful financial center where the Crown and other powerful people got their massive credit to pay for European wars and lavish lifestyles. So, other that for nationalist exaltation, they might be huge in \u201cthe History of Spain\u201d, even in the History of the World, but they barely register as a footnote in \u201cthe History of the Rank-and-File Spaniards.\u201d We are more emotionally involved in historical events that do have a direct influence on modern Spain\u2019s issues, like the War of Succession or the Carlist Wars (related to current nationalism / seccessionism) and specially the Spanish Civil War that resulted in the Francoist tyranny, still sort of a \u201craw wound\u201d with an important self-identifying component. Those ancient Conquistadores\u2026 well, they are literally gone, they left centuries ago. ",
