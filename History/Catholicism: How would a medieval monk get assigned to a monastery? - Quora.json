            "answer_text": "First, most medieval monasteries were independent--and even today most monastics (Benedictines and their offshoots) take a vow of \"stability\" to their own community, so they are members of that house and not of a broader order. So the monastery you enter is your house; in a sense you are assigned there by choosing to enter there. Of course, the Abbey you enter may then establish a daughter house, and you are given the choice to transfer to that house or stay with the original house. Similarly, when a monastery closes, its remaining members have to find another community to join, or be dispensed from vows entirely, while priests may incardinate in a diocese, and so on. Most full monks in medieval monasteries had to be educated as children--which meant that they had to join as children, offered by their parents, so they could attend the monastic school and learn the necessary skills such as reading, and speaking Latin (for the monastic prayers). This was similar to the process by which the family (parents) decided on the future of all their children, by apprenticing them to established masters to learn a craft, or making arrangements for marriages, or designating their inheritances. Often the eldest son of a noble family became the heir; the second son was sent to the Church (monastery), and younger sons either became soldiers or had to find some other way to survive. Later, especially under the Cistertians, there developed the \"lay brother,\" who had a much less onerous choir prayer schedule, but did much of the manual labor of the house--for example, farming and harvesting, or building. Again, you could chose to enter a specific house, which became your house. However, such lay brothers were often assigned to a grange or daughter house by the abbot, to work where they were needed. Many did chose the role of lay brother, because it was seen as a \"more humble\" vocation. Another development of the High Middle Ages especially was the growth of congregations of monasteries, such as Cluny or even the Cistertians. Especially with Cluny, there was a constant traffic of monks coming and going at Cluny, to learn \"how things should be done\" before going back to their own houses to carry out the reform there, or being sent out from Cluny to reform or found other houses. At one time, there were over 300 choir monks at Cluny, plus many more visitors from other houses! Under such circumstances, a monk could be sent by his Abbot to another house--but in theory he could refuse to accept such an assignment to another house. (How many actually did refuse is quite another question!) ",
