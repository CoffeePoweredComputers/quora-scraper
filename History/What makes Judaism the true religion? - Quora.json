            "answer_text": "What makes Judaism the true religion? If monotheism is the best approach to religion, then Judaism is the true religion. With the except of Zoroastrianism, which is older than Judaism by several hundred years (but currently has less than 200,000 adherents worldwide and is suspiciously dualistic in its theology), the other monotheisms\u2014Christianity, Islam, Samaritanism, Bahai\u2019ism, Mormonism, Sufiism\u2014all derive and ultimately draw their moral authority from Judaism. Christianity claims to be an improvement on Judaism, but as a Jew, I just don\u2019t see it. Jesus sure as hell isn\u2019t the Messiah we were expecting; our Messiah will establish paradise on earth immediately, not at some ill-defined point in the future, and he will be a human being, not a supernatural entity. In fact, Christianity appears originally to have been an attempt to make monotheism attractive to pagans by sugarcoating the moral message and coopting Eastern Mystery religion tropes (the whole resurrection-and-reincarnation-as-a-god aspect, which echoes Egyptian mythology and fertility cults like those of Adonis, Persephone, and Ishtar). Its great failing is the emphasis on faith over good works, which practically ensures a surfeit of immoral behavior since the sinner is guaranteed a place in heaven so long as he sincerely converts at the last moment. Since the social value of religion lies in its ability to encourage and enforce ethical behavior, Christianity as a moral force is an utter failure. Islam claims to be a superior exposition of God\u2019s moral laws found in Judaism, but again, all of its ethical lessons are derived directly from Jewish thought. According to Muhammad, if I\u2019ve read this correctly, Jews are misinterpreting the Torah, but he\u2019s not very specific about what it is precisely we\u2019re doing wrong. Better convert to Islam, just to be on the safe side. Same goes for Christians\u2014Jesus was a prophet, but he didn\u2019t expound the whole law as delineated in the Koran, so best to convert in order to be on the safe side. This is the Muslim version of Pascal\u2019s Wager. Christianity represents a genuine break with Jewish thought, with its emphasis on faith over good works and mercy over justice. I happen to disagree strongly with that message, but that\u2019s either here nor there. Islam, on the other hand, is just a repackaging of Judaism. It provides more social value than Christianity, but, claims to the contrary, does not represent an improved moral system relative to Judaism. Both Christianity and Islam wish Judaism would go away. By continuing to exist, Judaism cast real doubt over the validity of both \u201csuccessor\u201d religions. You\u2019re welcome to your own faith of course, but again, if monotheism is the hallmark of the \u201ctrue\u201d religion, then Judaism is that religion. ",

            "answer_text": "This is actually self-contradictory. If you presuppose that Judaism is \u201cthe true\u201d religion, then you must also believe what Judaism says on the topic, which is that Judaism is \u2014 in fact \u2014 not the sole source of truth or the sole path to living a good life; to the contrary, while Judaism is the way of life of the Jewish people and is incumbent on members of the Jewish people to follow, Judaism views those who are not Jewish as not bound by the laws of Judaism and obligated to follow only basic laws of morality. Judaism sees all moral people \u2014 Jews and non-Jews alike \u2014 as having a place in Olam Habah (lit. \u201cthe world to come\u201d), and Judaism does not view being Jewish as necessary in order to be moral.
