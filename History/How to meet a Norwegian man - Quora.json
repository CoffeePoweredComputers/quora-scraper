            "answer_text": "Initially it is very easy. Alcohol is expensive here so when people go out to party they drink alcohol first at home, and shots at when they arrive. The alcohol sheds the skin of a morose Norwegian and they will easily talk to strangers. Also, they will probably wear their \u201cbeergoggles\u201d which means you will look pretty darn good. But as cinderella lost her shoe at 12 o clock and turned back into a servant, so is the effects of alcohol. The handsome Norwegian man you went to bed with might wake up with a beer belly and bad breath. Also, the beergoggles are off and you might be meeting him for \u201cthe first time\u201d hung over and with no makeup. Even if you pass the broken beer goggle test, the talkative prince has probably put his Norwegian stoic and silent coat on. So you can easily meet a Norwegian man at a pub, but it is safer to meet him casually at a coffee shop or hiking. Tip for a coffe shop: Try smiling and then looking away (no looking at him for more then a few seconds, that is unnerving to Norwegians and they think you might be a whore or a serial killer. Or both.). If he finds you attractive he will behave awkwardly by dropping his wallet and making ahem sounds. This is a window when you can smile again and take a open look at his wedding finger. If the courtship is well received the man will then awkrdly go out the door, regret it and come back and order another coffee- Then he will realise that you might think coffee number 2 is for a girlfriend and he will behave even more awkvard by saying \u201c I love coffee, must have two, just for me, I am single\u201d Woila!

            "answer_text": "You could try Norway. It\u2019s full of them. Online forums are good places as well \u2014 you just met me, and I\u2019m a Norwegian man*. Problem solved! But seriously, you\u2019re looking for a Norwegian man to date or marry, I think. That\u2019s not at all impossible, though you might need to adjust your expectations a bit. Norwegians tend to have a more relaxed attitude towards sex, relationships, and marriage. The idea of \u201ccourtship\u201d feels archaic for most Norwegians, so if yours is a very traditional culture you\u2019re in for a big culture shock. That\u2019s not to say Norwegians reject monogamy or commitment. Not at all. It\u2019s just that that\u2019s not the express goal of either sex or romantic relationships. It\u2019s one possible and good outcome, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with sex for sex\u2019s sake or short-lived romantic entanglements. \u201cDating\u201d, on the other hand, is a recent import that still feels awkward and stilted; most of the time, romantic relationships develop organically in the context of friendships or shared activities, like work or the local skiing club. Norwegians have clubs \u2014 klubber and foreninger \u2014 for everything. If you intend to meet a Norwegian man in Norway, join as many as you can. Meet guys by doing stuff together. The notion of sitting down for a formal dinner with the express purpose of evaluating each other for a romantic partnership, which is what a date is, just feels weird. If you need to rely on meeting Norwegians abroad, you should be targeting common vacation spots and the time frame late June through July. Spain is a popular destination \u2014 the Canary Islands, Ibiza, and Mallorca \u2014 as are the Greek islands of Rhodes and Crete. More Norwegians are choosing the Adriatic coast of Croatia, and Thailand is also popular, Phuket in particular. Look for the drunk, sunburnt Europeans with the sing-song language (though you may find it hard to distinguish between Norwegians and Swedes this way, Swedish guys are perfectly fine, too.) Be aware, though, of the beer-goggle phenomenon, as Elin Bentsen points out. A Norwegian man on vacation is even more likely than a Norwegian man at home to be drunk and on the lookout for nothing more than a vacation fling. Just because he\u2019s happy to go to bed with you today does not mean he\u2019s committed to marrying you. Far from it, in fact. Proceed with your eyes open, and good luck. * Taken. Sorry. ",
