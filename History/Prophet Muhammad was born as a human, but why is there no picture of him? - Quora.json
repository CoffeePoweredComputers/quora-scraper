            "answer_text": "Muhammad condemned arts such as painting, dancing and singing and told his followers to avoid these things as he believed such arts to be from Satan. Note: All the hadiths that I mention below are Sahih. Narrated Muslim:We were with Masruq at the house of Yasar bin Numair. Masruq saw pictures on his terrace and said, \"I heard `Abdullah saying that he heard the Prophet (\ufdfa) saying, \"The people who will receive the severest punishment from Allah will be the picture makers. Sahih Bukhari 5950 There are many grave sins such as murder and Adultery yet Allah gives the severest punishment to picture makers. Let this word reach to all illustrators, cartoonists and painters. 2. Narrated `Aisha: Um Habiba and Um Salama mentioned about a church they had seen in Ethiopia in which there were pictures. They told the Prophet (\ufdfa) about it, on which he said, \"If any religious man dies amongst those people they would build a place of worship at his grave and make these pictures in it. They will be the worst creature in the sight of Allah on the Day of Resurrection.\" Sahih Bukhari 427 3. Narrated Aisha: (mother of the faithful believers) I bought a cushion with pictures on it. When Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) saw it, he kept standing at the door and did not enter the house. I noticed the sign of disgust on his face, so I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa)! I repent to Allah and H is Apostle . (Please let me know) what sin I have done.\" Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) said, \"What about this cushion?\" I replied, \"I bought it for you to sit and recline on.\" Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) said, \"The painters (i.e. owners) of these pictures will be punished on the Day of Resurrection. It will be said to them, 'Put life in what you have created (i.e. painted).' \" The Prophet (\ufdfa) added, \"The angels do not enter a house where there are pictures.\" Muhammad even hated the people who played Musical instruments. Sahih al-Bukhari 5590 Narrated Abu 'Amir or Abu Malik Al-Ash'ari: that he heard the Prophet (\ufdfa) saying, \"From among my followers there will be some people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk, the drinking of alcoholic drinks and the of musical instruments, as lawful. And there will be some people who will stay near the side of a mountain and in the evening their shepherd will come to them with their sheep and ask them for something, but they will say to him, 'Return to us tomorrow.' Allah will destroy them during the night and will let the mountain fall on them, and He will transform the rest of them into monkeys and pigs and they will remain so till the Day of Resurrection.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Because Prohpet Mohammad was born in 571 A.D and centuries later, camera's were invented only on 1816. That was too early for a Prohpet to be born. Such a prestigious issue. Edit 1:(29-aug-2020) For Muslims it's an absolute prohibition - muhammed or any of the other prophets of Islam should not be pictured as well as made statues, they donot encourage the worship of idols. This is uncontroversial in many parts of the Islamic world. And a 3 yr old muslim child knows that. Still I wonder why do you post such questions.?? Edit 2: (29-aug-2020) I won't stop posting comedy, jokes, fun or whatever like this, until I make sure people understand that Quora is a place to share knowledge and experience and stops asking such questions just to earn followers and views.
