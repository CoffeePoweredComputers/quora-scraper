            "answer_text": "No. Firstly because there are many movies in which it would be entirely irrelevant, or even illogical. To whatever extent is reasonable for the genre, movies should be representative of reality, and reality holds that you don\u2019t have LGBTQ people in every instance every time every place. Just like there isn\u2019t always going to be a white person, or an Asian person, or even a man or a woman. Sometimes you legitimately don\u2019t have that kind of diversity simply because it is realistic \u2014 not because someone is intentionally limiting it. I confess it has grown bothersome to me that some game shows, for example, seem to always feature at least one homosexual couple in every show. The implication of that is that something like one in every three or four couples is gay, but that is obviously not reality. Thus intentionally going out of your way to be inclusive may increase your diversity, but it is artificial, and breaks the immersion of the experience, thereby making it less enjoyable and less effective. Besides, placing requirements on artistic work is little more than an insult to art itself. Let\u2019s not coddle ourselves like that. We don\u2019t need it. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. To me, making \u201cgenuinely-out-of-the-heart\u201d LGBTQ movies should be a given. But so many directors and producers are scared of doing so because they don\u2019t want to risk ruining their reputation or tanking at the box office. So they are in wait for the right timing or safety nets (ie when LGBTQ topics would be most prevalent). Nowadays, Hollywood and some other growing movie companies have been so obsessed with hitting it high at the box office, that they have lost a LOT- and I mean a LOT- of touch with creativity and risk-taking. Back when I was a child, there were a great amount of experimental and creative films\u2014more so in the eighties, when my mother was a teenager. The music industry was also full of LGBTQ people like Freddie Mercury, Boy George, George Michael, etc. but people didn\u2019t really shame anything back then because the internet or box office didn\u2019t tell them what to do/like and how to think or give any crazy buffoons the power to troll anonymously. The late eighties, nineties, and 2000s also taught us to not be racist, sexist, classist, homophobic, and hateful and to embrace other people. But now you have the internet and all these stupid statistics telling us what\u2019s right, what\u2019s wrong, what we should hate, what lies we have to eat up, what\u2019s cool, and all that BS. Because of the internet, the world has become and untrusting, angry, cruel, and unfair place for everyone because of it, everyone is so divided and judgmental. Now this all comes down to movies not wanting to take risks\u2026 The Box Office is the reason why we are forced to hear about/watch Disney and Marvel trash. These movies are honestly godawful and terribly written generic pieces of works, but people eat them up because the box office and the internet tells them they are cool. So people who make actual quality stuff don\u2019t get attention because of this cycle. Regarding LGBTQ movies, yes people are still scared about making them. But I think more people in the audience are just [starting] to seek for them. So we are a far way behind still, to make the big ratings happen for them. Now, to get back to the point\u2014I especially hate celebrities and anyone who take advantage of LGBTQ movements. Like, people who have never supported it before or have once stated they did not like the idea of LGBTQ relationships now suddenly act like they support it because there is a growing amount of people who are fighting for their rights. This is why I say that supporting minorities should be a given and NOT a cause to pity or profit off of, because suddenly changing minds to a more popular one makes someone seem opportunistic, hypocritical, and not at all genuine in the slightest. If they truly cared about the community, they would have supported it with all their heart and passion even if profits were not at all involved. ",
