            "answer_text": "Pre-historic people as recent as 7\u20138,000 years ago did not have anything like the sense of time structure we have. The introduction of the first formal calendars, likely Sumerian circa 4 kya, would have been the first awareness of artificially structured time, a lunar month split into days, and imposed by a priest-elite. For a hunter-gatherer 40 kya time was measured by sun position, moon position and phase, star positions, and seasons, probably highlighted by events such as when \u201cthose good berries\u201d are ready or when the herds calf, flowers bloom, or birds fly together, etc. While the idea of Tuesday, 2 o\u2019clock tea time would have been an alien concept, the ancient human mind was fully aware of the cyclic time signals nature provides in such abundance. There\u2019s no good reason to deny the same sensibility applying to all of the several human species that lived in the past million years, not just h. sapiens in the last 40k years. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Phil sorry short answer I\u2019m not terribly sure. I can comment on a few things related to time. Time is based on a sexagesimal system aka 60 is the base. This comes from Ancient Mesopotamian mathematics. This was developed circa 2000 BC. The first sundials came from Egypt: Circa 1500 BC in their 19th Dynasty. Originally it is thought obelisks in Egypt were their precursor. The Egyptians divided the day into two main increments, each with 12 segments - I\u2019ve never thought much of this but suggests to me they would have been aware of the Sumerian base 60 thing to go 12? Stonehenge (and presumably other similar monuments) were timekeeping devices, many of which predate the sundial by hundreds of years, but I don\u2019t really know anything about them. Water clocks also appear to have dated from around this time: and evidence for them have been found in Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley and China all around the same time. Ancient Greece greatly improved the design of these hundreds of years later. Hourglasses, came later: believed to be some time round 150 BC, possibly in Alexandria. Personally I love hourglasses, and find this thing, a half hour glass I bought some time ago, quite hypnotic  Sorry, my knowledge of anything pre-historic is not the best, and time is not a specialty.
