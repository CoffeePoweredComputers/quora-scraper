            "answer_text": "In some measures, the UK\u2019s abolition of slavery was more impressive than the American abolition, but in other measures it fell almost equally as flat. Like in the US, the slave trade was officially abolished in 1807, though the practice of slavery was allowed. These regulations tightened up in 1824, 1843, and 1873. Whereas abolition of the practice of slavery in the US required a war which nearly fractured the country and killed more Americans than any other war, the UK banned slavery with the simple Anti-Slavery Act of 1833. Kind of. The Act abolished slavery in all of the British Empire, except the areas owned by the British East India Company (all of present day India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan), Ceylon (present day Sri Lanka), and St. Helena (a southern Atlantic island). Indian slaves were formally freed in 1861, Sri Lankan slaves in 1844, and St. Helenian slaves in 1834. All in all, the UK beat the US to the punch in the respect of the formal abolition of slavery. However, just as the US imposed Jim Crow laws and the Black Codes after slavery, the British empire held many of their colonial possessions and minority groups in similar subservience. For example, non-payment or \u201cpayment in trust\u201d of indigenous workers in Australia continued into the 1970s. While the UK has never formally allowed for race discrimination in the British Isles, racism in the public-at-large and in the imperialist structure of the global economy continues even today. Another thing: when slavery was ended in the UK, slave owners were compensated by the government for their lost labor. A \u00a320 million fund was setup using a \u00a315 million loan that was only paid off in full in 2015. So, even when being condemned by their government, slaveowners were coddled. This may have been necessary to avoid a civil war, but it also is an ugly historic example of people acting so wrongly that they\u2019re rewarded to pacify them instead of justly punished. So, to recap: the UK did a better job than the US in ending slavery by doing so without violence, abolishing earlier, and by not setting up formalized segregation in the British isles. However, abolition was not complete, as major portions of the world were excepted. Further, similar to the US, the UK has a horrifying history of imperialism that functioned as de facto slavery for over 100 more years, the impacts of which are felt in almost all of their former colonial holdings today. Finally: I\u2019m a white American with access to Wikipedia and interest the history of human rights. If anyone more qualified wants to correct, add, or help this answer, I am more than open to comments and making future edits, or just linking someone\u2019s better answer. This topic, due to its seriousness and current impact, is vitally important to be accurate about. ",

            "answer_text": "I disagree with the premise. The popular notion is that once there was slavery in the US, then Lincoln banned it and had to fight a civil war to make the Southern States comply. The reality is that all US states had slavery originally, as did almost all European colonies at the time, and indeed many parts of the world that were neither European nor colonies. Slowly northern states started to get rid of the practice, but it was almost never just banned. It was a slow reduction in the practice, first banning forced enslavement but allowing debt slavery, the banning all enslavement but allowing possession of existing slaves, and so on. Almost all northern states respected the property rights of existing travelling slave owners rather more than the personal rights of the slaves, and almost never forcibly freed slaves passing through their states. The history of the abolition of European slavery is not one of a few enlightened individuals like Wilberforce or Lincoln suddenly realising that it's not nice and getting it banned in the space of a decade or two. Attitudes to slavery had been changing slowly for hundreds of years ",
