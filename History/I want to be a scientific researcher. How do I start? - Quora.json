            "answer_text": "It depends on how old you are... If you're in middle or high school, start reading all the science non-fiction you can get your hands on (actually, this applies to any age). Emperor of All Maladies and Where The Wild Things Were are two truly excellent places to start... Look for stuff focusing on the progression of scientific understanding. Once you can speak well - use scientific vocabulary, reference examples of research - you should probably think about what type if scientific research you want to do. The younger you are, the more opportunities you'll have to intern in different kinds of labs without anyone looking at you funny that you keep switching around. Marine biology? Lots of living at sea, pretty dirty, and not much money. Molecular biology? In a closed room doing bench work, but incredibly important and fun logic puzzles. Lots of possibilities.  Once you can present yourself well, start activating your network. Find people you know who can connect you with researchers. Cold-call professors whose research interests you (after having read a BUNCH of papers out of their lab). Go watch Jack Andraka's TED talk... If you're a mid-career professional who wants to seriously switch fields... Well, I guess pretty much the same applies, but you might have a bit more trouble finding opportunities, or people might look at you askance. I worked in my first molecular genetics lab as a junior in high school (did I want a career in research?, and my last pathology lab after my second year of teaching (did I want to go back?), and I think four labs in between, from fruit fly genetics to immunology, in academia and industry... Almost all opportunities I got via cold calls, and that I was willing to work nearly for free I'm sure worked in my favor. Ultimately though, clearly, I stuck with teaching and have been very pleased with that decision :-) ",

            "answer_text": "A very tricky question indeed! There can be two ways of answering this question, a straight forward technical one and the other is a little introspective in nature. I will try to answer in both ways, as I think it's intertwined. First of all, let us tackle in a technical way. Ideally, you need to get a PhD, post completion of your Masters degree. Once you finish your PhD, you need to do postdoctoral training, perhaps multiple ones to obtain academic exposure internationally. During these stints, it's highly mandatory to have proven research records in terms of publications in academically peer reviewed journals, talks and poster presentations. After this period, you are eligible to apply for scientist positions, but not necessarily you will make the cut unless and until there are vacancies in academic settings. Believe me, the competition is cut-throat and there are numerous good applicants who get rejected. Although there are ways in which you can also transition into industry as scientist and the roles are satisfactory in nature as your research may effect society for good. Now, coming to the philosophical part, if you think you have a mixture of curiosity, a keen eye for observation and detail, rational thought process and overall, a perseverant attitude to solve a problem, you have the qualities to be a scientist. The only thing missing and that research journey provides to you are endurance to tolerate failures, accept criticism and moving on! So if you dream to be a scientist, follow your dream to be one. ",
