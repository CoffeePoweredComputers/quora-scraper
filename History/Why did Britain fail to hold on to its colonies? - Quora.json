            "answer_text": "Its a bit like asking \u2018why did Britain fail to remain in the EU\u201d. The answer to both questions is that a majority of British people didn\u2019t want to. Why? The First World War marked an enormous a political \u2018changing of the guard\u2019 in Britain and Europe. The patronage based Imperial politics of the Victorian age were blamed for causing a war in which millions of disenfranchised Europeans and their colonial subjects paid the price - both with their lives and by bearing the brunt of of the economic after shocks in the \u201920s and \u201830s. By 1918 Britain\u2019s people were highly educated, urbanised and politicised, they had the vote and they were going to use it. It was difficult for them to square that domestic desire for representation with a disenfranchised colonial model. Most Britons had been prepared to allow a ruling class to run the country and Empire so long as it continued to grow in power and prestige, and continued to create wealth and social improvement in the UK. When it let them down they sought democratic alternatives, alternatives that did not fit with the Victorian idea of colonial patronage. Totalitarian and utopian variants of socialism and fascism took off as radical alternatives, and had some far reaching successes in Europe - in Russia, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Germany. Yet most British people were not ideologues, and didn\u2019t want to give up the democratic franchise and access to the market economy they had fought so hard for, but they did want government to work in their interests, not those of a ruling class. The hypocrisy of political freedom in the UK and political servitude in the Empire was difficult to sustain. Racism provided a way to square these two opposites for some, while others looked to a \u2018world revolution\u2019 (Comintern, Lenin\u2019s movement for a global socialist revolution succeeded in exploiting the issue, and mobilised many educated elites in the European colonies and among the political establishment in Europe - its often forgotten that it was Comintern not the Soviet Union that recruited the Cambridge spies for example - Stalin crushed Comintern after 1938). By the 1930s much of Britain\u2019s political establishment knew the writing was on the wall. Inter-war economic woes also hit the colonies - there were strikes and political unrest in India, Nigeria, Burma and many other colonies which proved the point. And yet Britain\u2019s economic model relied upon colonial sources of raw materials and markets for goods. How to get out of the totalitarian colonial game without adverse economic impact was the issue. The idea of creating a \u2018commonwealth of nations\u2019 emerged as a solution, one which was brought forward by the Second World War. After 1945 there was no longer any real debate. Britain had fought the war for \u2018freedom\u2019 and therefore could only sustain her global legitimacy (which it is often forgotten had increased as much as her economy had shrunk as a result of the war) by giving up her colonies. Britain had invented the United Nations, and its charter was a charter against Imperialism and for global democracy and free market economics. This became the new location of Britain\u2019s international influence. There was conflict of course driven by the Cold War, especially where the former Comintern leadership in colonies might drive them into the Soviet camp (Malaya and Aden for example), or where there were large settler populations to contend with (South Africa, Kenya, Southern Rhodesia/Zimbabwe). But in general the extrication from Empire was rapid and smooth. To remain the beacon of a democratic free world that she had become during World War Two, and to win the Cold War against totalitarian socialism, Britain had no alternative. The economic shift to a commonwealth did not really work, which is why Britain entered the EU in 1974 - in the aftermath of the oil crisis and envious of the economic miracle led by France and Germany in Europe. How she will fair trying to rebuild that model in the post-Brexit future is an interesting question. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not sure this can be answered simply and you could write a book trying to explain it. However, as an average member of public with a general interest in history, if I was to sum it up, I wouldn\u2019t say there was one single reason. There were many reasons. Great Britain had a vast empire, and if you take the moral out of it for a second, it did it successfully for a very long time. Now each country had a different situation, whether we are talking about India, Ireland, Australia or Kenya. However, in my opinion, as Great Britain moved through a process of industrialisation, and the general population become more \u201cbetter off \u201c (loosely speaking) and more and more people got the vote, the public became more politically aware both about local issues and broader international issues. And a lot of the \u201cwrongs\u201d that needed to be done in order to keep an empire together wasn\u2019t so easy to sell to the public. What people nowadays call collateral loss isn\u2019t always easy to stomach. Secondly, more importantly as the native population of each country also became a bit more aware of their situation and as more and more native people became aware of the issues through wealth and education, it naturally meant that they wanted to govern themselves and didn\u2019t want to work to make a monarch in a distant land richer. I believe this is the most important reason. As Britain\u2019s power and wealth became less it became harder to manage and justify. If you look at some of the so called leaders or revolutionaries of independence like Ghandi as an example, they often came from very comfortable backgrounds and had the very best education. So once great people like him became aware of the situation and felt something needed to be done to change things, they eventually did. Most countries have their stories of independence. It\u2019s just the Irish and the Indian ones are more we\u2019ll known to me because of text books. The British empires legacy can still be felt in much of the world. We can argue good bits and bad bits forever. Please note I am not a historian and I apologise if I got any facts wrong. This is just my general knowledge and opinion. ",
