            "answer_text": " Benito Mussolini, running on time. Well, His claim to fame, the one that stood head and shoulders above all others was, \u201cHe made the trains run on time.\u201d But some even deny that! The fact was Europe at the time, no, let me say the World at the time was dived by two main ideologies, Left,and Right with all degrees in between as soft, or hard, extreme, or balanced, etc. Therefore each ideology had their paladins Stalin, and Soviet Russia, Marxism, Mussolini Fascism in Italy, Hitler was a latecomer.  Il (The) Duce and his late apprentice. Well, supposedly he had the trains run on time, Now the true is, Italy was divided as were other many countries at the time between Fascist, Nazis, vs Communist, and those Fascist still sight at memories when the Duce ruled Italy, and gave them a sense of grandiosity, and memories of the come back of the Roman Empire, to a very impoverish, and weak Italy at the time.  And as you can see they were a a crowd, who followed, and idolized Mussolini, and wrote verses such as these:  Sorge il sole canta il gallo, Mussolini monta a cavallo. The Sun rise, and the rooster sings, and Mussolini rides his horse. And there were those, very old now, who secretly sighted, at the times when the trains in Italy run on time, and liked to say: \u201cSAY WHAT you like about Mussolini, he made the trains run on time.\u201d That was the famous last excuse for Fascism, conveying the idea that while dictatorship might not be very nice, at least it got things done. They may be a few left, or young fascist believing so. True or false? Well, the Washington post on July 13, 2017 publish the following: \u201cMILAN \u2014 Earlier this spring, the owner of a tobacco shop in Jesolo, a beach town near to Venice, got into a fight with a group of international tourists. The reason? They were stunned and angered when they saw the shop was selling lighters with pictures of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.  Hitler and Mussolini running out of time. While the tourists may have been shocked, the cult of Mussolini is \"alive and well in Italy,\" as a German magazine noted a few years ago. Trinkets bearing the images of Il Duce, as Mussolini is known, are readily available to purchase \u2014 Mussolini's birthplace, a small town in central Italy called Predappio, has a popular gift shop \u2014 some restaurants and cafes across the country display pictures of the dictator, and a beach resort in Chioggia, another town near Venice, recently made headlines for its fascist regime theme.  A Cult. Now the Italian government is trying to clamp down on that cult with a law that would ban the production and distribution of goods that celebrate Mussolini and his regime. Parliament is currently discussing the bill, which has the backing of the ruling Democratic Party. If approved, the law will also introduce harsher penalties for those engaging in neo-fascist propaganda online.\u201d As I mention before Mussolini had his followers, and people who sight at his memory, even Frances Mayes, was shocked to enter Italian houses and discover in a few of them the picture of Mussolini, hanging on the living room, as late as 1997!  Il Duce, just grandiloquent pomposity, or something to be proud? Well ask the Italians. ",
