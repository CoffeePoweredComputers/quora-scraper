            "answer_text": "No. Muslims and Pakistani deserved Pakistan. Especially given the circumstances and social realities of the time. The political environment of that time left little room for them or given them confidence that they will be able to carve their destiny the way they desired. So personal regret does not count when one considers the greater good. Last 70 years mean Pakistan has defined or acquired an identity of its own. It won\u2019t be practical to unite because there are players in various domains of our nations whose interests are aligned along many different lines. Two set of powerful players rule their fiefdoms and no one will let go of their turf. Yet it should not prevent us being civil neighbors who are cordial with each other. That itself would be a huge win. ",
