            "answer_text": "Why do you use \u201cthey\u201d as all pronouns in your question? Which one is referring to whom? Persians were not trying to invade Greek lands. There were no such thing as Greek lands. Greeks were independent city states, which were constantly at war with each other. Their common thing was their language. Besides that, there wasn\u2019t much in common among Greek city states, and they were warring with each other for power for thousands of years. Naturally some of them allied with Persians, the greatest empire of their time and in the world up to that time, and asked for protection and collaboration \u2014 which is what they received. The other city states however, did not give up their warlike behavior, and kept on harassing the weaker ones, even those under Persian protection. So they were taught a lesson. But they didn\u2019t learn from that either. They incited riots and chaos in the Greek city-states that had allied with Persians. This was not direct war, but political meddling, and the only way to stop it was to attack them. Imagine if another country\u2019s intelligence service openly meddled in your affairs and elections until your country is in chaos, what other option would you have other than attacking them? So that is what Persians did. And taught them a lesson in doing that. And then helped the other city-states flourished and grow significantly.  But when the Greeks had the upper hand, some 200 years later, what they did is they destroyed pretty much everything in their path. That was not uncommon, but was not the attitude of the Persian empire. So yes, that makes them the bad guys in comparison. ",

            "answer_text": "In the West Persia has traditionally been considered the pestulent \u201cbad guy\u201d. A urusory read through of the March of the 10,000 by Xenophon makes it clear that the Persians were very mean spirited and insolent, consistently angagonizing the Greek mercenaries there to help them. I cannot recall a single source in western media depicting the Persians as anything other than a ruthless and cunning adversary. The only ppsitove mention of a Persian King is in the Book of Ester and story is vague at best. ",
