School programs, in pretty much all fields, are notorious for presenting the knowledge \u201cas if it were simple and easy to understand\u201d. This is a huge con we play on kids for centuries - we make them believe, in school, that everything can be easily explained, that everything is simple. Maybe one unintended result of that (otherwise noble) attempt to \u201cmake the world understandable by teaching in school\u201d are various religious sects and loony political movements. People are taught in school that things are simple. So, later in life, people demand, and get, simple answers for everything. Say, \u201cit is all them Jews\u201d. Worked for the Germans, did it not? There is a reason, why pretty much any profession has a long \u201capprenticeship\u201d period. When people, out of school, learn that it is really not all that simple. One has to start with the \u201ccommunism in East Europe was not that simple phenomenon\u201d. You cannot investigate \u201chow did it end\u201d, unless you understand how it started, and how did it last. The simple version has it \u201cit was a Soviet occupation\u201d. OK, if one needs a one liner, this would be it, correct. Hence, the simple answer would be \u201conce Gorbachev decided and announced that the Soviet army will switch from an occupational role to a consensual ally role, communism in East Block was a goner\u201d. Is the above true? Yes. Is it true deeply, comprehensively enough, to be useful? Frankly, I do not know. We miss a lot with those one-liners. We miss a lot of understanding. That lack of understanding bites us later, I think. ",

An economic historian would point to an economic cause, a political historian to a political cause, a military historian to a military one (perhaps Afghanistan?), and a historian from or of one of the countries involved may well focus on local issues there and find similarities across the region. It\u2019s the same with pretty much any other major event in history. You could argue that the First World War started due to Gavrilo Princip shooting Franz Ferdinand, but the reality is that something would have started it if Princip had been at home in bed with the flu, or someone had joggled his arm at the critical moment. In relation to the collapse of the Soviet Union, you could say (and you wouldn\u2019t be wrong) that the stagnation of the late-Brezhnev-era USSR set things in motion which couldn\u2019t be stopped by the time Gorbachev took over. Alternatively, you could say that it was all Gorbachev. Or you could point to someone like Lech Wa\u0142esa. I know someone who would argue quite cogently that \u201cthe single event\u201d which triggered the collapse of the USSR was the establishment of the USSR, if you want to go backwards in time. ",

It is also an ahistorical proposition that a single event precipitated the collapse of the Soviet Union\u2019s client states. Eastern Europe The Collapse Of The Kremlin\u2019s Empire A socialist analysis of the events in Eastern Europe \u201cWhat justification is there, then, for terming the upheaval in Russia a socialist revolution? None whatever beyond the fact that the leaders of the November movement claim to be Marxian socialists\u201d. Quoted from an article entitled \u201cThe Revolution in Russia \u2013 Where it Fails\u201d in the Socialist Standard, August 1918. Introduction The events in Eastern Europe in the winter of 1989/90 shattered many of the illusions of workers who had imagined that the political and economic system that existed in those countries had something to do with socialism.  The Myth of Soviet \u201cSocialism\u201d An analysis from Russia makes many of the points we do. On all sides we hear it said that \u201cafter 1917 a Marxist utopia was realised in our country,\u201d that we had a \u201ccommunist regime\u201d or \u201csocialist state,\u201d that \u201cwe were building socialism and communism,\u201d and so on. This makes it essential for us to grasp the true essence of Marxism, to understand what socialism and communism are.  Socialism/communism, it means the same in the classical Marxian, pre-Leninist sense, will be an advanced , post-capitalist society, run by us all, locally, regionally, globally, in administration over resources and not a government over people. It will be a market -free, money -free, production for use (not for sale), free access (not rationed access) commonly owned,(not private, corporate or state owned) revolutionary permanent break with the present capitalist one. It has never existed anywhere. It is not a \u2018reformist\u2019 nor a \u2018statist\u2019 version of capitalism which retains wage slavery in any form. It will be the mature, politically conscious task of the immense majority to make it happen and not the minority vanguardist led actions of pseudo-revolutionaries. \u201cThe organising tenet will be from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union - Wikipedia. THE TWENTIETH CPSU CONGRESS: THE ANTI-STALIN BOMBSHELL  The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was held during the period 14\u201325 February 1956. It is known especially for First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev's \"Secret Speech\", which denounced the personality cult and dictatorship of Joseph Stalin.  It was a most traumatizing experience for thousands upon thousands of militants educated in the cult of Stalin to learn from world communism\u2019s most authoritative voice that \u201che who had been the leader of progressive humanity, the inspiration of the world, the father of the Soviet people, the master of science and learning, the supreme military genius, and altogether the greatest genius in history was in reality a paranoiac torturer, a mass murderer, and a military ignoramus who had brought the Soviet state to the verge of disaster.  The self-confidence in many countries of the communist ruling class was shattered at the moment of the Twentieth CPSU Congress. The old idols and sacred values were torn apart, and the need for an autonomous domestic way to socialism was reasserted. The meaning of the resurgence was unequivocal: It signified a resolute break with the Stalinist conception of the leading role of the party apparatus. To disseminate their unorthodox views, intellectuals decided to go into the factories and talk to the industrial workers. The political and intellectual life was thus increasingly polarized between the Stalinist nostalgia and the partisans of change. The shock created by Khrushchev\u2019s de-Stalinization campaigns affected all East European countries. The disarray among local elites resulted in the loosening of party controls and the emergence of emancipating movements from below, especially in Poland and Hungary. Once the Stalinist anti-Tito charges were exposed as insane fabrications, the national communist temptation became rampant in the region. The demolition of Stalin\u2019s myth and Khrushchev\u2019s calls for a creative approach to revolutionary doctrine emboldened unorthodox thinkers to question the foundations of the existing order.   The Soviet Union tried to save as much as possible of its ideological myths, but the wave of liberalization swept irresistibly through the satellite countries. The most dynamic examples in discovering a new sense of autonomy and in attempts to relinquish the frozen Stalinist carcass turned out to be Hungary and Poland. Profound effects from the Soviet Congress also were felt in all the other bloc countries, where the party intelligentsia became increasingly radicalized and critical of the past abuses. ",

Of course, we can observe that certain events may have accelerated the collapse of the Soviet dictatorship. One of them was Mikhail Gorbachev's assumption of the function of secretary general. An equally important event (in my opinion) was the failure of the Chernobyl plant, which put a heavy burden on the Soviet Union. Also, attention should be paid to Romania and the revolution that took place there. I think this event showed many communist dignitaries how they could end up if they didn't let go. ",
