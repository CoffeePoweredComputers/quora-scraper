            "answer_text": "I had a 1991 Chevy K1500. I bought it with 172,000 miles on it it ran great. The previous owners never changed the oil or did any kind of maintenance on it. I had it for 11 to 13 years, I don't remember which. When I sold it with about 203,000 miles on it, it still ran great. The biggest repair that I did on it was to replace a corroded and leaking intake manifold. While I had it off, I cleaned many pounds of sludge from the top of the engine and cleaned out the oil returns which were completely plugged up. For years it had burned and leaked oil. Once I clean the valve train and oil returns out it stopped leaking and I never had to add oil again. So the answer is forever. I had repaired rust on it several times and had repainted the entire truck. It had a lot of quality of life issues, but never a serious problem. The answer on how long these trucks will last is FOREVER. ",

            "answer_text": "My current GMC is a 2005 and it has right around 190,000 miles on it. Vehicle longevity depends a lot on how the vehicle is maintained. When properly maintained, you can easily 300,000 to 400,000 miles out of them without having to do any major drivetrain work. If the vehicle isn't maintained and has a rough daily use, it might not last more than 5 or 6 years. Location is also a factor in longevity. Some locations (like here in NY) are prone to rust issues which will significantly reduce the longevity of the vehicle. My current GMC has almost no rust on it because the previous owner (original as I am the second owner) used the vehicle to make bi-annual trips to Florida so my truck hasn't seen much snow and salt over the years.
