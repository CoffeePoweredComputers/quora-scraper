            "answer_text": "In april or may 2013, I had a friend who told me about the silk road and how great it was. He said he bought some cocaine and powdered MDMA on there. My advice to him at the time was to avoid that site completely because either it will be shut down and all the information would go to the FBI or else it was actually run by the FBI as a sting operation. Either way all the information would go to them. Once when I visited him he showed me the site, there were people selling research chemicals, precursor chemicals, common chemicals, labware, pipes, syringes, books, and pretty much anything you could think of that is virtually impossible to get elseware. He offered to set me up with an account to on the site so I could sell lab equipment at a 400% profit.I considered it for a few weeks but decided against it since it would be virtually impossible for me to honestly claim I had no idea that any equipment I sold was for legitimate purposes. I knew the site would be shut down and all the sellers would be caught, even if they are selling legal items they could still be charged with conspiracy if they knew those items would be used for illegal purposes. Being a law-abiding citizen, I personally avoided the site completely. ",

            "answer_text": "The Silk Road was known for merchants who sold contraband, but the marketplace never tolerated the sale of any item that might have hurt people. Such items that were banned include firearms, stolen credit card information, child pornography, counterfeit money, personal information, assassinations, and weapons of mass destruction. Contraband that was commonly offered for sale on the site was largely cannabis, heroin, and LSD. This was a secure and anonymous way for small dealers to distribute goods, which was the biggest reason people used the Silk Road. However, there was a much lighter side of the Silk Road that people haven't heard much about. Merchants would also sell legal items like books, art, apparel, and jewelry. ",
