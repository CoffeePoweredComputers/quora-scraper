            "answer_text": "I believe that Aristotle and Plato, one day there, walking to talk about the cup of sicuta, why not hemlock? What would be the difference? And they fought. Plato laid bare the cave and Aristotle turned yellow in Science and hence philosophy, the mother of Science, let's say longevity, longevity, ended up excluding, from Science, Philosophy and divided both continue today, in the year 2020. According to Plato, Socrates, when drinking the poison, would find the light. According to Aristotle, Socrates, when drinking the poison, would die. And logic came. Divorce without right to claim. Plato saw in Aristotle, the commander-in-chief of all the shadows and the people who saw them as illusory, enslaved inside and relegating to himself, Plato discovered the light, not outside, but inside, and in a quiet corner. Quiet in a corner, in Portuguese, in Brazil, it's @ketinunkantim. And Aristotle could only think of Plato what, when they fought and separated? That Plato had gone mad. Socrates died, as Aristotle himself had suggested it would happen, and Plato remained naked, with his hand without a pocket. Aristotle, in the right to Socratic inheritance, stayed with Science and Plato with philosophy, vain, vain philosophy, which was worthless even for poetry. Anyway, any divorce is difficult but in the end, divorcees forgive each other, meet and realize how much they are unfair to each other. ",

            "answer_text": "Aristotle had enormous respect for his teacher. Aristotle, as Plato\u2019s best and brightest student, studied under him in his Academy for twenty years. Still, he differed with his master on many things. Scholars have sometimes painted them as opposites. But don\u2019t be fooled \u2014 the greatest Platonist of them all was none other than Aristotle himself. They agreed more than they disagreed. That is all too often forgotten. ",
