            "answer_text": "Why do most Muslim countries hate Israel? I have gone through many answers here, against the question. However most of those answers do not deal with the real story behind. Hence this answer. Most Muslim countries hate Israel, since the rulers and people of those lands feel Israel, as an unjust occupier of previously Muslim owned land, Palestine. They are not well informed on the background behind the creation of modern nation of Israel. Back ground information is very old and hardly covered by the present news media too. I give below the background information from a different perspective, behind the formation of modern State of Israel. Trust this article could be a tool for a better understanding of the conflict and softening the hearts filled with anger and mistrust. Around BC 1930 Abram a man in the city of Ur in Mesopotamia get revelation from Jehovah, the God Almighty, the Creator of universe, to leave the city of Ur.The Call of Abram- Genesis 12: 1 Now the Lord said to Abram, \u201cGo from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you. 2 And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. 3 I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.\u201dGod promised the Holy Land (Palestine) to Abram and his descendants. Genesis 15:18\u201321 On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, \u201cTo your offspring I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates, 19 the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 20 the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, 21 the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites and the Jebusites.\u201dAs above, two promises were made to Abram, whose name God changed to Abraham subsequently. a. in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed\u2026.. b. God promised the Holy Land to Abraham, as above.Before Abraham\u2019s death God foretold him about the slavery of his descendants in Egypt. Genesis 15: 13- Then the Lord said to Abram, \u201cKnow for certain that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there, and they will be afflicted for four hundred years. 14 But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions. 15 As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age. 16 And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.\u201dAbraham died subsequently and God confirmed the same covenant with Issac, Abraham\u2019s son. Genesis 26: 2 And the Lord appeared to him (Issac) and said, \u201cDo not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land of which I shall tell you. 3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you, for to you and to your offspring I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham your father. 4 I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and will give to your offspring all these lands. And in your offspring all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, 5 because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.\u201dAfter Issac\u2019s death, God once again confirm the same covenant with Issac\u2019s son Jacob, whose name God subsequently changed to Israel. Genesis 28:13 And behold, the Lord stood above it and said, \u201cI am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring. 14 Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed. 15 Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.\u201d 16 Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, \u201cSurely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it.\u201d 17 And he was afraid and said, \u201cHow awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\u201dAs God foretold Abraham, his offspring became slaves in the land of Egypt. After 400 years of slavery, God delivered them through Moses and Moses led them to the Holy Land with the miraculous involvement of their God, Jehovah.During their exodus, at Mount Sinai God had a miraculous encounter with sons of Israel and made a covenant with them, which reinforced the covenant God made with Abraham before. As per this Mount Sinai Covenant Israel must honor their side of the covenant. God again promised to stay with the Israel and never to abandon them, because they were his chosen people. Exodus 19:5 \u201cNow therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; 6 and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.\u2019\u201d God told Israel, that for their part, they must dedicate themselves to serving God for ever. World should become, a better and holier place, by obeying God's laws. And through them entire world, including each and every family will be blessed. God gave them the Ten Commandments and other Torah laws at Mount Sinai, and told them to obey the Law diligently.What was Israel\u2019s response? Exodus 19: 8 All the people answered together and said, \u201cAll that the Lord has spoken we will do.\u201d And Moses reported the words of the people to the Lord.Because of the sins of the previous people who lived in the Holy Land, God driven out them from the land and gave the land to His Chosen People, Israel. Also, their boundaries were spoken to them. Exodus 23:31 \u201cAnd I will set your border from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the Euphrates, for I will give the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you shall drive them out before you. 32 You shall make no covenant with them and their gods. 33 They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against me; for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.\u201dIn Deuteronomy 28 God listed one after other the blessings if they obey Him.Blessings for ObedienceDeuteronomy 28:1-\u201cAnd if you faithfully obey the voice of the Lord your God, being careful to do all his commandments that I command you today, the Lord your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth. 2 And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, if you obey the voice of the Lord your God. 3 Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the field. 4 Blessed shall be the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground and the fruit of your cattle, the increase of your herds and the young of your flock. 5 Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl. 6 Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out. 7 \u201cThe Lord will cause your enemies who rise against you to be defeated before you. They shall come out against you one way and flee before you seven ways. 8 The Lord will command the blessing on you in your barns and in all that you undertake. And he will bless you in the land that the Lord your God is giving you. 9 The Lord will establish you as a people holy to himself, as he has sworn to you, if you keep the commandments of the Lord your God and walk in his ways. 10 And all the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of the Lord, and they shall be afraid of you. 11 And the Lord will make you abound in prosperity, in the fruit of your womb and in the fruit of your livestock and in the fruit of your ground, within the land that the Lord swore to your fathers to give you. 12 The Lord will open to you his good treasury, the heavens, to give the rain to your land in its season and to bless all the work of your hands. And you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow. 13 And the Lord will make you the head and not the tail, and you shall only go up and not down, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you today, being careful to do them, 14 and if you do not turn aside from any of the words that I command you today, to the right hand or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them 14. If they disobey terrible curses will befall on them. See Deuteronomy 28: 15\u201368. As it is in detail I give below only prominent points. For details, the reader encouraged to go through the link. Bible Gateway passage: Deuteronomy 28 - English Standard Version 15. Curses for Disobedience Deuteronomy 28:15\u201cBut if you will not obey the voice of the Lord your God or be careful to do all his commandments and his statutes that I command you today, then all these curses shall come upon you and overtake you. \u2026.. 20\u201cThe Lord will send on you curses, confusion, and frustration in all that you undertake to do, until you are destroyed and perish quickly on account of the evil of your deeds, because you have forsaken me\u2026 21 The Lord will make the pestilence stick to you until he has consumed you off the land that you are entering to take possession of it\u2026. 22 The Lord will strike you with wasting disease and with fever, inflammation and fiery heat, and with drought and with blight and with mildew. They shall pursue you until you perish\u2026. 23 And the heavens over your head shall be bronze, and the earth under you shall be iron. 24The Lord will make the rain of your land powder. From heaven dust shall come down on you until you are destroyed\u2026. 25\u201cThe Lord will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You shall go out one way against them and flee seven ways before them. And you shall be a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth\u2026.. 26 And your dead body shall be food for all birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth, and there shall be no one to frighten them away\u2026. 27 The Lord will strike you with the boils of Egypt, and with tumors and scabs and itch, of which you cannot be healed. 28 The Lord will strike you with madness and blindness and confusion of mind, 29 and you shall grope at noonday, as the blind grope in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways. And you shall be only oppressed and robbed continually, and there shall be no one to help you\u2026. 30 You shall betroth a wife, but another man shall ravish her. You shall build a house, but you shall not dwell in it. You shall plant a vineyard, but you shall not enjoy its fruit. 31 Your ox shall be slaughtered before your eyes, but you shall not eat any of it. Your donkey shall be seized before your face, but shall not be restored to you. Your sheep shall be given to your enemies, but there shall be no one to help you\u2026. 32 Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people, while your eyes look on and fail with longing for them all day long, but you shall be helpless\u2026. 33 A nation that you have not known shall eat up the fruit of your ground and of all your labors, and you shall be only oppressed and crushed continually, 34 so that you are driven mad by the sights that your eyes see\u2026. 35 The Lord will strike you on the knees and on the legs with grievous boils of which you cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head. 35 \u201cThe Lord will bring you and your king whom you set over you to a nation that neither you nor your fathers have known. And there you shall serve other gods of wood and stone\u2026. 37 And you shall become a horror, a proverb, and a byword among all the peoples where the Lord will lead you away\u2026. 43 The sojourner who is among you shall rise higher and higher above you, and you shall come down lower and lower. 44 He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him. He shall be the head, and you shall be the tail\u2026. 45 \u201cAll these curses shall come upon you and pursue you and overtake you till you are destroyed, because you did not obey the voice of the Lord your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes that he commanded you\u2026. 52\u201cThey shall besiege you in all your towns, until your high and fortified walls, in which you trusted, come down throughout all your land.

And you shall be plucked off the land that you are entering to take possession of it. 64 \u201cAnd the Lord will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other, and there you shall serve other gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known. 65 And among these nations you shall find no respite, and there shall be no resting place for the sole of your foot, but the Lord will give you there a trembling heart and failing eyes and a languishing soul. 66 Your life shall hang in doubt before you. Night and day you shall be in dread and have no assurance of your life. 67 In the morning you shall say, \u2018If only it were evening!\u2019 and at evening you shall say, \u2018If only it were morning!\u2019 because of the dread that your heart shall feel, and the sights that your eyes shall see as male and female slaves, but there will be no buyer.\u201d PROMISE TO BRING THEM BACK FROM EXILE Through Moses, God foretold them the aftermath of exile too. Deuteronomy 30 and Ezekiel 36 and 37 chapters give the details, including the final destiny of Holy Land. Repentance and Forgiveness Deuteronomy 30: 1 \u201cAnd when all these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you call them to mind among all the nations where the Lord your God has driven you, 2 and return to the Lord your God, you and your children, and obey his voice in all that I command you today, with all your heart and with all your soul, 3 then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have mercy on you, and he will gather you again from all the peoples where the Lord your God has scattered you. 4 If your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of heaven, from there the Lord your God will gather you, and from there he will take you. 5 And the Lord your God will bring you into the land that your fathers possessed, that you may possess it. And he will make you more prosperous and numerous than your fathers. 6 And the Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring, so that you will love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live. 7 And the Lord your God will put all these curses on your foes and enemies who persecuted you. 8 And you shall again obey the voice of the Lord and keep all his commandments that I command you today. 9 The Lord your God will make you abundantly prosperous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your womb and in the fruit of your cattle and in the fruit of your ground. For the Lord will again take delight in prospering you, as he took delight in your fathers, 10 when you obey the voice of the Lord your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes that are written in this Book of the Law, when you turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Prophecies through Prophet Ezekiel around BC 500 Ezekiel 36:1-\u201cAnd you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord. 2 Thus says the Lord God: Because the enemy said of you, \u2018Aha!\u2019 and, \u2018The ancient heights have become our possession,\u2019 3 therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord God: Precisely because they made you desolate and crushed you from all sides, so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations, and you became the talk and evil gossip of the people,4 therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God: Thus says the Lord God to the mountains and the hills, the ravines and the valleys, the desolate wastes and the deserted cities, which have become a prey and derision to the rest of the nations all around,5 therefore thus says the Lord God: Surely I have spoken in my hot jealousy against the rest of the nations and against all Edom, who gave my land to themselves as a possession with wholehearted joy and utter contempt, that they might make its pasturelands a prey.6 Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I have spoken in my jealous wrath, because you have suffered the reproach of the nations. 7 Therefore thus says the Lord God: I swear that the nations that are all around you shall themselves suffer reproach. 8 \u201cBut you, O mountains of Israel, shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people Israel, for they will soon come home. 9 For behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown. 10And I will multiply people on you, the whole house of Israel, all of it. The cities shall be inhabited and the waste places rebuilt. 11 And I will multiply on you man and beast, and they shall multiply and be fruitful. And I will cause you to be inhabited as in your former times, and will do more good to you than ever before. Then you will know that I am the Lord. 12 I will let people walk on you, even my people Israel. And they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance, and you shall no longer bereave them of children. 13 Thus says the Lord God: Because they say to you, \u2018You devour people, and you bereave your nation of children,\u2019 14 therefore you shall no longer devour people and no longer bereave your nation of children, declares the Lord God. 15 And I will not let you hear anymore the reproach of the nations, and you shall no longer bear the disgrace of the peoples and no longer cause your nation to stumble, declares the Lord God.\u201d FINAL DESTINY OF HOLY LAND AND ISRAEL Ezekiel 37: 19I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. In accordance with their ways and their deeds I judged them. 20 But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that people said of them, \u2018These are the people of the Lord, and yet they had to go out of his land.\u2019 21 But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came\u2026.. 22 \u201cTherefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came. 23 And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am the Lord, declares the Lord God, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes. 24 I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and bring you into your own land. 25 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. 26 And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. 27 And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.[a] 28 You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God. 29 And I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses. And I will summon the grain and make it abundant and lay no famine upon you. 30 I will make the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field abundant, that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations. 31 Then you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and your abominations. 31 It is not for your sake that I will act, declares the Lord God; let that be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel. 33 \u201cThus says the Lord God: On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be rebuilt. 33 And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, instead of being the desolation that it was in the sight of all who passed by. 35 And they will say, \u2018This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden, and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.\u2019 36 Then the nations that are left all around you shall know that I am the Lord; I have rebuilt the ruined places and replanted that which was desolate. I am the Lord; I have spoken, and I will do it. ANCIENT ISRAEL WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO NATIONS- ISRAEL AFTER EXILE WILL BE UNITED TOGETHER I Will Be Their God; They Shall Be My People 15 The word of the Lord came to me: 16 \u201cSon of man, take a stick[f] and write on it, \u2018For Judah, and the people of Israel associated with him\u2019; then take another stick and write on it, \u2018For Joseph (the stick of Ephraim) and all the house of Israel associated with him.\u2019 17 And join them one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand. 18 And when your people say to you, \u2018Will you not tell us what you mean by these?\u2019 19 say to them, Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am about to take the stick of Joseph (that is in the hand of Ephraim) and the tribes of Israel associated with him. And I will join with it the stick of Judah,[g] and make them one stick, that they may be one in my hand. 20 When the sticks on which you write are in your hand before their eyes, 21 then say to them, Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will take the people of Israel from the nations among which they have gone, and will gather them from all around, and bring them to their own land. 22 And I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. And one king shall be king over them all, and they shall be no longer two nations, and no longer divided into two kingdoms. 23 They shall not defile themselves anymore with their idols and their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions. But I will save them from all the backslidings in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. 24 \u201cMy servant David shall be king over them, and they shall all have one shepherd. They shall walk in my rules and be careful to obey my statutes. 25 They shall dwell in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob, where your fathers lived. They and their children and their children's children shall dwell there forever, and David my servant shall be their prince forever. 26 I will make a covenant of peace with them. It shall be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will set them in their land[i] and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in their midst forevermore. 27 My dwelling place shall be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 28 Then the nations will know that I am the Lord who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary is in their midst forevermore.\u201d For details please go through the link . Bible Gateway passage: Ezekiel 36-37 - English Standard Version I would urge the reader to go through the Jewish history of endless persecution and sufferings for thousands of years, which went on exactly as foretold by Holy God. Many of these prophecies are getting fulfilled right before our eyes. Ezekiel 38 and 39 chapters foretold the Gog Magog War, ONLY after the formation of modern State of Israel. Middle East politics is going on in line with these ancient prophecies. Remember, ultimately the Holy One of the universe is behind all these happenings. We must realize this fact, before blindly siding with the parties in the conflict. ",

            "answer_text": "Ever heard of the Crusades? In 1099, a group of Christian Catholic warriors under the patronage of Pope Urban II and led by various European counts and dukes captured Jerusalem. Four years earlier, the Pope declared the First Crusade against the Muslims in the Levant to \u201creclaim\u201d the Holy Land from the Muslims. Initially, it was a response to the Roman (Byzantine) Emperor Alexios I\u2019s call to aid and all the lands that were to be captured by the Crusaders were to be returned to Roman rule. The Crusaders were made to swear fealty to the Emperor before departing, but that did not stop them from breaking their pact. These ambitious minor lords from Western Europe instead sought to carve out their own independent realms from territories captured. The County of Edessa, the County of Tripoli, the Principality of Antioch, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem were all Crusader States formed after the successful war against the divided Muslims, too busy fighting among themselves to stage any sort of proper defense. The Crusaders, led by who would become first King of Jerusalem, Godfrey of Bouillon, slaughtered the inhabitants of Jerusalem; Muslims, Christians, and Jews in cold blood. Houses of worship were pillaged, not even churches were spared. For Muslims, it was a dark period of division that led to weakness and shame, that the third most holy site in Islam could have been successfully besieged and taken right under the noses of the Muslims without the Muslims managing to properly confront these \u201cinfidel invaders\u201d.  Jerusalem would remain under Crusader control for 87 years. During that time period, Muslims were so divided to the point of some of them allying with the Crusaders States against rival Muslim leaders and governors. The Crusaders used this to their advantage, as long as these Muslim emirs and sultans were too busy fighting eachother they would not be fighting them. Sound familiar? Sounds like something going on right now does it not? The situation remained as it was with the Crusaders holding the advantage, until the Zengid rulers of Mosul went on a bid to unite the Levant under their rule and faced the Crusaders. The Crusaders at this point began losing territory, one Crusader State fell after the other. Salahaldin Al Ayyubi, a protog\u00e8 of the Zengids would come to power in Egypt and realligned it under Zengid and thus Abassid rule. Soon Salahaldin would control a huge chunk of territory compromising Egypt, the great majority of the Levant, down through the Hejaz, and into Yemen. This united Muslim force soon marched on the Crusaders, until Jerusalem itself was liberated by Salahaldin\u2019s forces. This time, the Crusaders were given free passage to leave with their Queen, Salahaldin had all the power in the world to attain venegeance for the blood spilled nine decades prior. However, he did not. He responded to cruelty with mercy, and injustice with justice, and even ordered the washing of the floor of the Christian Holy Sepulcher with rose water. Why do Muslims hate Israel? Because it is nothing more than a modern day Crusader State, a repeat of history. This isn\u2019t about Nazis, that was an injustice, and the Zionists responded with their own injustice against the Palestinians. Our Palestinian brothers and sisters expelled from their millenia old homes, and still to this day live under occupation. If Nazis were to blame why is this \u201cJewish State\u201d not in Germany? Why take territory from people having nothing to do with the injustice against the Jews in Europe? As history shows us, the Crusader States could only survive so long surrounded by enemies. Israel will cease to be, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, nor maybe in the next decade or two, but someday there will be a new Salahaldin, someday the Muslims will not be too busy killing eachother, and that day, when the Palestinians will be able to go back to their homeland, with their house keys still in their possesion, the day when the Al Aqsa mosque will be under Muslim rule again. That day\u2026 that day, will be a day of joy and celebration, where injustice will be met with justice, and cruelty with mercy. Its only a matter of time Inshallah\u2026God willing. ",
