            "answer_text": "That man is incapable of humor. And I instinctively don\u2019t trust people who don\u2019t have a sense of humor, about themselves, about the world and about life in general. I could tell that immediately because I\u2019ve never seen Trump give a huge, loud guffaw, despite having been in the spotlight for decades. The most he does in terms of humor are these weak little smiles of self-satisfaction at his rallies, when the audience breaks into huge laughter after he lands one of his patented lines, almost always being a nasty rip against someone or something. But that\u2019s a weak, weird, bullying shadow of humor, not actual clever humor itself. And he certainly doesn\u2019t joke about himself and his foibles, even gently, which is really Trump\u2019s problem with humor. That notion that Trump doesn\u2019t have a sense of humor was completely cemented for me when he tried to roast people at the Al Smith dinner in NYC a few weeks before the election in 2016. It was a cringe-worthy performance\u2014what passed as \u201cjokes\u201d were thinly-veiled, nasty swipes at Hillary and all his supposed enemies. You could see how uncomfortable most of the well-heeled, upper-crusty audience was behind him, rolling their eyes, and having looks of shocked surprise. Not much laughter or mirth. Though I did see one thing that I\u2019ve never seen in Trump before or since at that Al Smith dinner in 2016\u2014embarrassment. He was genuinely sweating bullets and cowed because these people\u2014people as wealthy or wealthier than he is\u2014were not buying what he was trying so desperately to sell. Once Trump is with an audience of people he genuinely wants to impress\u2014in this case the Manhattan elite\u2014and this audience doesn\u2019t respect him and adulate him automatically, he becomes this meek, stuttering fool. It was quite the performance, and the reason why he sticks to rallies where people are sure to LOVE him. Because he can\u2019t take the heat when the audience is not automatically pro-Trump. That\u2019s also another reason he hasn\u2019t had a full press audience since that disastrous one in February 2017\u2014journos are obviously not going to genuflect to his \u201cgenius.\u201d ",

If you go and look at the Catholic Charity dinner on 10/20/16, which both he and Hillary attended near the end of the campaign; he can be seen laughing at a few of the jokes about himself. The role he acted out for his campaign was one of angry victim of a corrupt system and it was serious business to Make America Great Again. So, it would be out of character for him to be laughing or making light of anything while he's trying to create a narrative that the country is in the shitter. ",

They rarely laughed, but when they laughed or joked, it was in a sarcastic way, usually showing contempt and disdain for their enemies. Normal pleasure and glee at a funny joke? Doubtful that a megalomaniac has that in him. But Pres. Trump is no bloodthirsty dictator or megalomaniac, yet his humor is the same contemptuous sarcasm and mockery seen in those great dictators. Does this mean he has something in common with the mentality of the great dictators? I cannot contend that is so, but his evident respect and admiration for Pres. Putin worries me. Am I a Democrat? Hell, no. Did I vote for Hillary? Hell, no. ",

He laughs at people who are opposing him to discredit them. He laughs at his own jokes about the disabled. He is 100%, in all ways, completely inappropriate. He\u2019s also laughing all the way to the bank at the moment. But I look forward to the smile melting off his face when they slap the handcuffs on him. Then *I* will laugh. ",
