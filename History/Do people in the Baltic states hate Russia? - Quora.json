            "answer_text": "Call it dislike, hate or whatever else. I call it deep-rooted complexes. But that\u2019s a matter of definition. What\u2019s more interesting is how they cope with this hate. As Russia is too big for them and honestly speaking we would even notice whether they hate us or like, they are exercising their hate on those they can reach i.e. the so-called \u201cminority\u201d. Which in Latvia is around 40% of the country and in the capital Riga - over 50%. They\u2019ve got funny understanding of minorities, don\u2019t they? So, how it works. When Latvia and Estonia became independent (Lithuania is different in this aspect, but the the minority is really a minority, about 10%) they did not give their citizenship to the Russians living there. Of course it was not formulated this way, that would be too much even for them. The exact formulation is \u201ccitizenship is obtained automatically by those being citizens in 1940 and their descendants\u201d. That results in following paradox - people, who left these states in the 40ies and never returned, don\u2019t speak the language and didn\u2019t do a shit to help these counties have got the citizenship and people, who moved in Latvia or Estonia say in the 50ies, worked there life long, helped with building of the industry, helped to regain independence(sic! they honestly were fighting for the independence side by side with Latvians and Estonians) are people of second sort. Having alien\u2019s passports and no citizenship. I mean no citizenship at all. Independence of Latvia and Estonia produced about a million of stateless people within minutes. Just imaging, how much they hate Russians. And I stress, it\u2019s not about KGB agents or communists, it is just about the Russian nation as a whole. To tell the whole story and to be fair, they are allowed to fain this citizenship by naturalisation. In the beginning years these test (language, history, laws) were so prohibitively difficult, that it was practically impossible even for a native speaker to pass them (for example there were questions like what fishes live in some shitty small river). After intervention of the European council (or some other human rights organisation, don\u2019t remember for sure) the tests became easier. But the main discrimination remains - people born in the country, having their parents and grandparents being born their and living even 70 years in the country doesn\u2019t make you get the citizenship automatically. If anyone knows another such example in a country considered democratic, I would be happy to read it. Of course, it is clear, that Russian has got no official status in the countries. For those who didn\u2019t get it, I \u201cminority\u201d constituting 40% of population doesn\u2019t have any official status for their mother tongue. I know only three such countries in Europe (and probably it is in the World). It is Latvia, Estonia and Ukraine. Not surprisingly it is exactly in these three countries that veterans of Waffen SS are considered national heroes and fighters for freedom. And instead of being ashamed of fighting on the side of Hitler, they proudly wear their medals and march in the centers of cities. Russian schools are being closed, and recent law practically allows only primary schools in Russian. (I remind that Russians are not a vanishing minority, but 40% in the country and over 50% in major cities like Riga and Daugavpils; in Estonian Narva it is even 95%). Latvian infamous language law results in language police going into private businesses and checks how well the personal speaks Latvian. Riga mayor Nil Ushakov is ethnically Russian by the way, the Russian \u201cminority\u201d peu a peu gets the citizenship, right to vote and elects their representatives to high posts. And he is regulary fined by the language police for using Russian language in his private facebook. With the justification that it is not private, as he is a mayor. So yes, they really do hate Russia. But at this point I have to make a disclaimer. It is not the people that hate Russia and Russians. Of course some fools do, but mostly, as everywhere, people are quite friendly and open, most people speak Russian at more or less good level, at least those that work with people, it is rather an exception that someone would act aggressively upon hearing Russian speech or even being addressed in Russian. But the state policy and rhetoric is indeed extremely anti-Russian. They just very well understand that this is their only chance of remaining in power. ",

            "answer_text": "Speaking from Estonian perspective - no, we do not. To answer this question I actually created a virtual map in my head of my family, friends and acquaintances and out of 50 or so people, whose point of view I am aware of, there is only one who really hates Russia and Russians (by her own words) and another one who strongly dislikes them. I see similar proportions in the society as well. Russians themselves think differently for several reasons. First, that\u2019s what they have been told in their media for decades. Russian media is actually a propaganda machine under government control. They are told that we are fascists, that we discriminate local Russians, that we blindly hate them etc. Second, they are themselves very prejudiced towards us (this can be seen from other answers here as well) and they presume the feeling is mutual. Third, they used to have privileged status in the Soviet Union, now they have lost it and they think that this is a payback and punishment driven by hatred. Fourth, they misread our different temperament, customs and habits\u2026 I could go on. In reality Estonians take things cool. We don\u2019t really care about them enough to love them or hate them. We would not have survived the Soviet occupation otherwise. We are very patient, see things in longer perspective and we are quite rationale people. Hating Russians would be stupid and wasteful. Russia is the largest country in the world, we are one of the smallest ones, and nothing we do will change it. So why should we hate them? It takes a lot of energy to hate someone. Northern people cannot waste energy, it\u2019s a matter of survival. Hating someone is simply not in our mindset. However, as a nation we would also not have survived the Soviet occupation if we wouldn\u2019t have known how to stand our ground, how to remain ourselves and keep our culture. We don\u2019t hate Russians but we understand them very well, much more than they understand us (which they don\u2019t actually at all, even the local ones). We understand what is going on in Russia and what it has become. We warned our allies the direction Russia is going since the 90s. Nobody believed us, everyone thought we were paranoid. There was even a clash between Finnish and Estonian presidents in this matter after the Georgian war. Now everything we predicted have become true and even worse. But this is not hatred as well, it\u2019s simply realistic view of our neighbor\u2019s politics and ambitions. For several years the most popular show in Estonian radio was \u201cMystical Russia\u201d - thoroughly researched and very detailed discussion about Russian history. So far there has been around 750 episodes, 30 minutes each without music, commercials or other interruptions. There are also many documentary series in our TV and new ones are being made every year. Countless books, articles etc. Our newspapers feature news from Russia every day. We do all that not because we obsessively hate them or love them. We do that because they affect our lives and we want to understand them better. We would also like to engage local Russians better but we cannot do it if they are not interested. Unfortunately, Russian media is doing everything they can to turn Russians against us and keep this hostile status quo. It works for Putin. The biggest casualties of all this are local Russians themselves without even realizing it. Estonians take Russia as a force of nature. It can be beneficial but it can also be deadly. Living next door to a potential hurricane is dangerous, one must be careful and prepared. But to hate it... What\u2019s the point of that? ",

            "answer_text": "Five stories: 1: I was there, just after independence. My girlfriend showed me her family\u2019s apartment, with the marks still on the walls and ceilings of the partitions where the Russian family billetted on them had been allocated the best half of each room \u2013 warmest, nearest the light etc. Yes, she hated them - both personally, and as a nationality. They made no attempt to learn Estonian, and insisted everyone dealt with them in Russian, and wrote in Cyrillic. She and her friends spoke almost perfect English, because they would rush home every evening to listen to the BBC and watch western films on the TV [once the apartment block aerials had been turned from Ostankino to Eurosat]. And they were deliberately forgetting all the Russian language they had been forced to learn in school. 2: I was helping the Estonian government, in the years after independence, with the privatisation of their infrastructure. At one point, I was explaining how an IPO would be launched, and what money they would get from it. They were puzzled; hadn\u2019t realised that investors would actually pay for shares, and didn\u2019t have a government account into which the money could be paid. So I asked them what they wanted from privatising the infrastructure in the first place. They had a discussion - in Estonian - then turned to me and said: \u201cAll we want is that you sell one share to President Bush [the smart one; not the idiot] and one to Madeleine Albright [Secretary of State]. Because what we want from all this is recognition. Most westerners don\u2019t even know we exist. We want them to know who we are, and that we are under threat from our large neighbour next door. Our ultimate aim in all of this is to have a line of US Army tanks, track-to-track along our eastern border, with all the guns pointing east. Thank you\u201d 3: In 1991 Putin - then an official in the St. Petersburg administration - helped organise an illegal \u2018Referendum\u2019 amongst Russian-speakers in Estonia\u2019s Narva district on whether they wanted to \u201cReturn to Russia\u201d - i.e. support a Russian annexation of the District. Russian Cossacks and the \u2018Grey Wolves\u2019 gang gathered on the Russian side of the Narva river in readiness. [A sort of \u2018Prequel\u2019 to the Crimea take-over].  In the end, they were prevented from crossing into Estonia. But it was a close-run thing. And Estonians remember that. 4: I was with an Estonian colleague, who introduced me to his father. We talked a bit about history, and I sympathised with the old man about the German invasion during Operation Barbarossa in 1941. He glared at me really fiercely for a moment. \u201cInvasion?\u201d he said; \u201cThat was liberation. I was seven years old at the time, and I was out in the street with my parents and everyone else, waving a Swastika flag to welcome them into our town. And the girls were throwing flowers to them. The Germans were tough, and if you fought against them, you got shot. But that was nothing compared to what the Russians and the NKVD did. They not only controlled everything you did, they controlled what you were allowed to think.\u201d 5: We formed a consortium to bid for the privatisation mandate. It was a bad bid; lashed together at the last moment. So we knew we wouldn\u2019t win, and consoled ourselves with the thought that it had at least been a learning experience. We won. During the project, our Estonian colleagues would frequently ask \u201cWhat does Mr. Alexander think about this?\u201d. He was the leader of our legal team, and an excellent lawyer; but many of the questions had nothing to do with legal issues. At one point, I must have looked quizzical, and asked why his opinion was so relevant. My colleague said \u201cBecause he\u2019s Mr. Alexander\u201d. I still looked puzzled. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, do you\u201d?. I agreed. Here\u2019s what he recounted: It\u2019s 1919, and Estonia has, after hundreds of years as a Russian province, declared independence. But Trotsky\u2019s Red Army is invading from the east, and the \u2018freebooter\u2019 remains of the German army are invading from the south. At Churchill\u2019s suggestion, British Army officers are recruited to support, organise and train local militias across the old Russian Empire, to help them sustain their independence. To Estonia is sent one Captain Alexander. He reorganises the Baltische Landwehr [Baltic Home Guard] and, after a series of actions, they succeed in driving out both the Russians and the Stalhelm, and reaching a Peace Treaty recognising their independence from Russia. Captain Alexander rejoins the British Army. It\u2019s September 1939 and, as a minor \u201cbureaucratic tidying\u201d in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union marches in and occupies the three Baltic Republics. About 100,000 people are arrested and deported from Estonia, either to the \u2018Stans\u2019 or to the Gulag. They include all intellectuals, professors, police and army officers, lecturers, doctors, engineers, civil servants, high school teachers etc. Few ever return. It\u2019s July 1941 and the Wehrmacht, as part of Operation Barbarossa, march into the Baltics where [see Story 4 above] they are mostly welcomed. The Germans search for Jews, but the Russians had already deported them. Estonia settles down to three years of German occupation. It\u2019s the winter of 1944\u201345. The German occupying force has been defeated, Estonia is being reinvaded by the Soviet Union. Any male Estonian between 16 and 60 now knows [after the 1939\u201341 deportations] what to expect: summary trial by the NKVD as a suspected German collaborator, followed by exile to the Gulag, or execution. So they get out, by any means possible, across the [partly frozen] Baltic Sea to Finland or Sweden. Many die. The survivors are scattered around the Baltic shores. They have no country, no passport, no money or resources, and are suspected by the Allies of being Nazi sympathisers [see Story 4 above]. They need help. One of them suggests: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we try to contact that Captain Alexander, who helped us out, back in 1919?\u201d Everyone else poo-poohs the idea; on the basis that he\u2019s sure to be dead by then. But the original proposer persists, so the effort is made. And they find that Captain Alexander is alive. But he\u2019s not Captain Alexander any more. He\u2019s now Field Marshall Lord Alexander of Tunis, Chief of the Imperial General Staff and - usefully - Governor-General of Canada. They contact him. He talks to his Canadian Prime Minister, Mackenzie King. Since Canada is vast and under-populated, and the Estonians are good people, whom he knows, and has fought alongside, could Canada make room for them? The answer is yes. Today in cities across Canada there are Estonia Houses, Latvia Houses and Lithuania Houses, where the refugees can get together, keep the culture alive, and celebrate their deliverance. And the name of Alexander is right up there, somewhere between the Angels, and God. \u201cSo, my colleague said, once we saw the name \u201cAlexander\u201d on a CV in your bid, we couldn\u2019t give the project to anyone else. It was the very least we could do to say \u201cThank you!\u201d\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "They do. In my early childhood, back in the Soviet times, my mother and I would go to a Riga\u2019s suburb every summer, to swim in Baltic sea. Mom had cancer and was fighting for her life, she needed her vacation, hence such a luxury. The nature there was stunningly beautiful. The people, horribly mean. Getting anywhere was a problem, because, when asked directions, people either got insulted at the very thought they might understand a word of Russian (they did I am sure), or they\u2019d almost certainly point you in a wrong direction. A young, very ill-looking woman with a little girl, mind you. We\u2019d be lost and walk countless miles, dehydrated, because no one would give us water either. Once, when we were lost like this, we saw a restaurant. The waitress very rudely and abruptly (as usual) said the restaurant was closed, and shut the doors right in front of our noses, in the middle of the conversation. From the glimpse inside, we could see the place was very much open, and it was nowhere near the closing time. A woman knocked the door and started arguing with the waitress in Latvian, then stuck her foot into the door and made her let us in. The waitress shouted obscenities at the woman, from which I could only understand \u201cnahalka\u201d (a borderline Russian swearword). We were allowed in and were fed, plates thrown on our table angrily. We became friends with the woman. She translated for us that the waitress said to her: \u201cHope you die, nahalka\u201d. In Eastern Europe, where it\u2019s widely believed that words have power, that was a very serious thing to say. Never heard anything like that in my life. Our landlady, knowing we are Jewish, hinted that she liked Germans better than Russians. \u201cWe remember who entered Latvia how\u201d, she said with a dreamy voice. My Mom, very much an anti-communist and a wife, a daughter and a mother of anti-communists, said to that: \u201cAll I know is, if they had won, we would not be alive\u201d. Fast forward a few years. I had a Latvian friend here in the US. I told him how we were sent the wrong way all the time. He giggled. He said he did it, too, all the time. The cleaning machines on the beach, combing sand, almost driving over people at high speed, not even bothering to slow down to make sure people got out of their way safely. When people (well, just tourists, really) complained, a voice from the machine, with a thick Latvian accent, answered with scorn: \u201cYou are resting here, we are working\u201d. We understood on one hand why such a hatred. Our family had suffered from the Communists no less than their families, actually more than most, but to us, the Communists were not a separate ethnic group. They came from all ethnicities. Latvian communists, too, have contributed more than their share to Russian revolution btw. We did not associate them with a particular ethnicity, and did not project our hatred to the people of the said ethnicity. They did. The strange thing is that they associated Communism with Russia alone. Ukrainians, Georgians and such are off the hook. Makes no sense to me. So, while the origins of the hatred were political, the mass attitude was almost entirely racist. That was almost past life, but from seeing how Balts post on Quora and elsewhere, some things never change. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. But this hatred is a bit complicated. I can illustrate it with a real life example. I studied in Barcelona with a Russian girl. We often walked home together and had conversations about life etc. In Spanish. She was a nice and friendly girl. Her husband was a Spaniard and she had a small child. She wanted to have a calm and happy life. Who can blame her! One day I was approached by another coursemate. She was confused and asked me: \u201cI thought you hated Russia and Russians.\u201d \u201cI do,\u201d I replied. \u201cBut you and the Russian girl are like two best friends together.\u201d \u201cShe is a person,\u201d I replied. I think most Estonians think like me. We can communicate with all kinds of individuals, but that does not change our political thoughts or inner feelings. I do indeed hate Russia. I suppose I got along with the Russian girl because we never discussed any politics and she never asked me, if I could speak Russian (this question is a very big taboo). Well, she discussed politics once. She said: \u201cEstonians are really hardcore people. They got rid of us and the Germans.\u201d It was a nice compliment, I guess. I didn't take it any further. Shorter answer: Yes. However, don't look for any straight lines and clean feelings. Most Estonians are able to be polite with the enemy. I think that in a way we are like those aristocrats who suddenly entered a ballroom with a foreign gentleman. \u201cMy POW. Count X.\u201d \u201cAh, Count X!!! So nice to finally meet you. I am so sad the circumstances are a bit difficult. Do you dance? Play cards? Drink hot chocolate? Would you like to see my rose garden? Meet my lovely little cousin Princess Y?\u201d Edit: The aristocrat wouldn\u2019t have introduced his POW as a POW. He would have said my guest. Since I am not an aristocrat I am very insensitive about such harsh matters. ",

            "answer_text": "I personally have experienced this due to circumstances. Now you may be thinking how an Indian guy has experienced this strange hatred of the Baltic people for the Russians? Well to tell you the whole story from 2009 till 2011 I had a brief long distance relationship with a Latvian Blondie. During that period of my life I used to live in Barcelona ( 2009 -2013). She still lives in Riga. I am not going to discuss how we met or what kind of relationship was that. The funny fact is before meeting her I literally never knew that a country called Latvia existed. She used to visit me in Barcelona or we used to meet in Germany, or Belgium etc. Please keep in mind now am married to a Russian and live in Moscow region in a small town. Now comes the hatred part. She often used to travel to London for work or pleasure. One time I called her when she was in London and she was so God damn angry. I was surprised and asked her what was the reason. Her response was,\u201dWhy the fuck everyone thinks every blonde woman is from Russia?\u201d. The tone of her voice told me how much she used to hate that western people thinking her as Russian and she had to say to everyone nope she is Latvian and not Russian. This was first time I realized that. Second time, one day I called her from Barcelona during the afternoon and she said she was bored because her colleagues were not at work and she had to eat lunch alone. I was surprised and asked her is alone in the whole office and she said no. There are people in her room/floor. I was surprised and asked her then go have lunch with then. Her response, \u201cohh no, they are are Russians. They are different\u201d I was very perplexed because I didn't know this difference back then. Third time, it was during middle of 2010 we had a scientific conference at my university where i was a scientific researcher cum PhD student. We received a big delegation from St Petersburg including the Boss of Russian Academy of Science. That was the first time in my life i have met so many russian men and woman all dressed up properly. Women were wearing fancy dresses ans the men were in suits. So i called her and told her about this and her response was, \u201cOhhh the russians, Their women are like christmas trees and their men are always eager to military.\u201d I went to Riga to visit her in 2011 just before we broke up and there i realzed how much hatred is there for the Russians primarily due to keeping the Latvian speaking people under Russian occupation till the break up of USSR. Back then i wasn\u2019t aware of this long political issue. My ex Latvian told me this is the same feeling in Lithuania and Estonia. So yeah to sum it up, there is a hatred for the Russians in the Baltic states. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, we do. Generally, the tensions in geopolitical scene are way too high for anyone in the West to like Russia, even the local Russians dislike Putins Russia. Their homeland is Latvia. Personally speaking, I do dislike Russia, I don\u2019t have many reasons to like it. Particulary because of the history. History that has created the present situation which isn\u2019t pleasant. Let\u2019s be honest, who wants to live in a post-Soviet occupation territory that economic problems due to collectivization which destroyed our highly sophisticated industry and agriculture. Also, how many countries have a such a high minority population? It is a social problem but gladly it\u2019s disappearing slowly. I predict that in a few generations most Russian people will be assimilated. We disliked Russian policies in past and dislike them now aswell as they\u2019re threatening but we don\u2019t care about politics that much, we don\u2019t hate Russians. And as far as I know, only sides that claim that we do hate Russians is the troll media funded by Kremlin, the same media that calls our people Nazi collaborators and fascists for having a legionare day which is a day of rememberance for our people that had served in Waffen SS in WW2. I believe that we also have a victory day which is for Red armys victory. approx 100\u2032000 Latvian men died on frontline in WW2 fighting for the occupier sides. I\u2019m not sure what else what to mention but if you have more specific questions, then i\u2019ll gladly answer. Check the comments for some discussion. ",

            "answer_text": "They fear Russia with good reason, since they were first occupied by Tsar Russia and denied their own language for 100 years, then occupied 1940\u20131941 by Soviet Russia and then after Nazi Occupation Occupied again by Soviet 1945\u20131991, so that is 150 years of knowing how to fear Russia, including being reported to Gulag or Vladivostok while Russians moved in instead. They also know that they can beat Russia, because in fact it was these small states that made the Soviet Union collapse in 1991, when they were first to declare independence. As for Russians living in the Baltics, they have a choice of learning the language, moving to Russia or stay on an Alien passport, which most have done, because they can live and travel better that way than as Russian citizens. There is a constant tension with the Russians and with Russian propaganda, which they are doing a great job of countering as well. And they chose Swedish banks over Russian banks, with good reason, even though they went through a financial crisis and recovered extremely quickly. So I think they are proud of their independence and cautious while they joke about it. I think the beer commercial saying \u201dBaltas\u201d on the Red Square in 2001 says a lot about this relation. There is a lot of hate, frustration, racism and rightwing religious conservative nationalism that Homo Sovieticus has had to deal with after 1991, and I would say on the whole that the Balts have handled all that shit better than most others, including the Russians. Like Finland they have the Russian bear on their doorstep, but unlike other parts of Eastern Europe they do not try to rewrite or deny their history, but rather acknowledge that parts of this history was denied to them, so they try to catch up with the support of the Nordic countries, EU and Nato.

            "answer_text": "Yes and no.In Latvia the news does not focus that much on Russia, so many Latvians do not have any other idea about Russia than ''Putin - bad, Navalny - good''. Only Russia reporting happens when there is some bigger protest or some big news, or significant events that are important for Russians, like bigger reforms in the country (Putin's 6 years of presidency, pension reform etc.). There are no whole shows, like in Russia, dedicated to analysing how Russians (or other neighbours) live and whether they will freeze to death tomorrow. There are people that do hate Putin and ''vatniks'' (Putin supporters), but when asked why most of them would not be able to give a good answer, because they do not really follow Russian news. Corruption, occupation, criminals... these would be main arguments. But hardcore nationalists who would just hate somebody speaking Russian or sb having a Russian name are few, even less among younger generation. Mostly they are old ladies or old men who in some way (or whose parents) were slighted in Soviet times. Definitely the problem was much bigger in the 80s and 90s when whole city blocks of youth could just start a fight based on ethnicity. There are no crimes based on ethnicity today. ",

Russian people are neither hated, nor disliked in my country. This may not be the case in neighbours to the North, but here Russians are just another part of our society. Is there distrust of the Russian Federation? Yes, of course. This is due, for the most part, to historical aggression of Imperial Russia, then the Soviets, now the Russian Federation, against their neighbours (just look at what\u2019s happening in Ukraine). Is there a strong dislike for their politics? Yes, for the same reasons. But, while there may be distrust of Russia and certainly disgust at its imperial ambitions, there is no \u201chatred.\u201d ",
