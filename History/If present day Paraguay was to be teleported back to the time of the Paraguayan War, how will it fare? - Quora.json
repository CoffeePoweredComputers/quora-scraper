            "answer_text": "A2A If the present state of Paraguay, following its current borders, were sent back to the beginning of the Paraguayan War, say to the very start of the war on 14 December 1864, there would be no war at all. After the initial shock of being back 153 years ago, the modern Paraguayans would be quite happy asserting control over all those regions of Paraguay that were lost in that war, but in 1864 still belong to Paraguay, and bestowing the benefits of a modern economy on those 1864 Paraguayans. Remember Paraguay started the war! Modern day Paraguayans would have no interest in picking up the policies of now a vanished long ago (to them) dictator. War is not a staged battle where you are obligated to fight like a coliseum exhibition. The technology and knowledge present in modern Paraguay would be immeasurably valuable back then, and they would have little trouble leveraging that into making at the very least the pre-eminent regional power and economy, and a magnet for nations and businessmen the world over. An example of the problems and possibilities: Restoring imports like oil would be a problem, it would be in short supply as they must would only have their own stocks, This could be stretched perhaps by initiating alcohol production (perhaps in neighboring Brazil). The world petroleum industry in 1864 would be powerless to supply Paraguay\u2019s normal consumption, which is about 1.2 million tons a year (world output is 4 billion tons now) but in 1870 world petroleum output was 30,000 tons a year. They would have more luck getting people to produce vegetable oil for biodiesel (or burned directly), which could be produced on the million ton scale back then. They would probably happily assist other countries in developing the oil they need, probably for a major share of the production rights themselves, and would be building the processing facilities themselves. Thus Paraguay might become (partly out of necessity) a major world oil power. On the other hand, with the Itaipu Dam, they have immense electricity production - far larger than the nation needs. Effectively unlimited free electricity, but short on oil, would be a powerful reason to go electric, not oil of any kind, where ever possible. Paraguay has a good industrial base from which to expand to meet their needs. Paraguay is close to self-sufficient in pharmaceuticals, and exports them, so it would instantly control (and actually create) the world\u2019s pharmaceutical market. They would be able to attract ready suppliers of any resource they lacked (though oil would be somewhat difficult for scale and technology reasons). If you are still curious about the military angle - modern Paraguay possesses, between its regulars and reserves armed forces (about 200,000 total) that exceed the entire combined forces the Triple Alliance put into the field, with weapons (even just looking at small arms) that are immeasurably superior. Aircraft and heavier weapons would not be needed. I imagine they might be interested in \u201crequesting\u201d that Brazil terminate the practice of slavery forthwith, fortuitously timed with the abolition of slavery in the U.S. ",

            "answer_text": "Present day Paraguay has automatic weapons and an Air Force. They would be able to stop a frontal assault by waves of Brazilians and Argentinians. With automatic weapons on the battlefield against 19th century infantry you just have to hold Your Position and fire away. They do have a very small Air Force, however the Allies back then had none. That said, present day Paraguay would be able to extract a very bloody victory from the Triple Alliance. They would have a day in the park massacring mutilating and killing everything the Brazilians and Argentinians would throw at them. The Triple Alliance had only cavalry and very effective waves of Infantry. This means the Paraguayan Army would be able to wipe the Allies out. Hands down. Paraguayan Victory. ",
