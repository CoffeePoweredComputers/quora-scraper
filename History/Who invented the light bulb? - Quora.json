            "answer_text": "Edison? nah!.. ok, he wasn\u2019t dumb.. but he was more of a \u201cbusiness\u201d oriented person than an inventor.. Edison was the smart guy who started a research facility company, and attributed all of his workers merits to his own company (thus to himself..), something that is even in practice today by many companies! \"Keep on the lookout for novel ideas that others have used successfully. Your idea has to be original only in its adaptation to the problem you\u2019re working on.\" \u2013 Thomas Edison Much of what the public knows about America\u2019s most celebrated inventor is riddled with misconceptions. Among other things, the shrewed businessman Thomas Alva Edison, did NOT invent the light bulb. Following is a list of 10 inventions that are often attributed to Edison, but were in fact not his making. 1. The Electric Bulb or Incandescent Lamp (from Volta to William David Coolidge who perfected it, although Sir Humphrey Davy was THE inventor) developed and refined by lots of researchers.. a few of Edison\u2019s staff.. although the most important progress were made before and after Edison\u2019s people did work on it).. Ask any child who invented the light bulb, and the answer is likely to be \"Thomas Edison\". - Contrary to what schools have taught for years, the American icon, Thomas Edison, neither invented, nor held the first patent to the modern design light bulb. In fact, light bulbs used as electric lights existed 50 years prior to Thomas Edison\u2019s 1879 patent date. Note: Edison lost all patent rights to the light bulb both in Britain and the United States.  2. The Electric Chair (by Harold P. Brown, an Edison employee).. The first practical electric chair was invented by Harold P. Brown. Brown was an employee of Thomas Edison, hired for the purpose of researching electrocution and for the development of the electric chair. Since Brown worked for Edison, and Edison promoted Brown\u2019s work, the development of the electric chair is often erroneously credited to Edison himself. Furthermore, Brown\u2019s design was based on George Westinghouse\u2019s alternating current (AC), which was then just emerging as the rival to Edison\u2019s less transport-efficient direct current (DC), which was further along in commercial development.  3. The Movie Camera (by William Dickinson, an Edison employee).. though the idea of moving images had already been developed by a British photographer named Eadward Muybridge in 1878. He wanted to prove that when a horse ran, all four of its legs could be up in the air at once. By taking several photos very fast, Muybridge proved his point. Then, Louis Le Prince made the first movie recorded at 12 frames pr. second in 1888, while Edison\u2019s first moving picture \u2018Monkeyshines\u2019 did not appear until 1889 or 1890, although it was made in 1887.  4. The Power Generator (by Nikola Tesla).. who in the early 1880s, invented the AC generator, which allowed electricity to be transmitted over greater distances than could be done with DC power, which required a generator every few miles. Edison was making good money off of DC power, and didn\u2019t want to change, or worse, have someone else move in on his turf. Not surprisingly, Tesla and Edison had a long standing feud over this and many other inventions[1] . Edison did not invent the first electrical power station. Ultimately, though, he (well, his staff) did improve the designs of existing generators and regulators to create the first commercially successful power station capable of delivering affordable power for electric lighting.  5. X-Ray Photographs (fluoroscope).. In 1887, Nikola Tesla, not Edison, was among the first to investiage the nature of X-Ray\u2019s using designs based on the Cathode Ray Tube. Eight years later, Thomas Edison began investigating materials\u2019 ability to fluoresce when exposed to x-rays. The fluoroscope he (his staff) developed became the standard for medical X-ray examinations. Nevertheless, Edison dropped X-ray research around 1903 after the death of Clarence Madison Dally, one of his glassblowers. Dally had a habit of testing X-ray tubes on his hands, and acquired a cancer in them so tenacious that both arms were amputated in a futile attempt to save his life.  6. The Storage Battery (by Gaston Plant\u00e9 of France in 1859\u201360 and its improvement by Camille Faure in 1881).. What invention made Edison the most money? The alkaline storage battery. Ironically, though, Edison (his staff) did not invent the first storage battery, but combined new materials to create a storage battery suitable for practical use. By the time he (they) perfected the alkaline storage battery, electric-powered cars had lost out in the competition with gas-powered cars that could be driven far greater distances. A failure as the motive force for automobiles, the alkaline storage battery was ultimately a great commercial success as the power source for train lights, marine appliances, and miners\u2019 lamps. Prior to this invention, miners used candles or small oil lamps attached to their hard hats as their light source.  7. The Record Player (by Emile Berliner).. Thomas Edison did not invent the record player. Rather, he (his staff) invented the phonograph, which was intended for making recordings. The phonograph was first marketed as a dictation machine and only later modified for use in musical devices. The ability to record sounds had been invented long before Edison\u2019s phonograph. The gramophone, invented by Emile Berliner, was actually the first record player as we know it. To compete with the success of the record player, Edison and his company later devised the \"disk\" phonograph. <- not all true either though, as it was Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory who made several improvements in the 1880s, including the use of wax-coated cardboard cylinders, and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record <- sound familiar?  8. Recorded Audio (by \u00c8douard-L\u00e9on Scott de Martinville).. Thomas Alva Edison conceived the principle of recording and reproducing sound between May and July 1877 as a byproduct of his efforts to \u201cplay back\u201d recorded telegraph messages and to automate speech sounds for transmission by telephone. He announced his invention of the first phonograph, a device for recording and replaying sound, on November 21, 1877. But \u2013 fully 17 years earlier (1860), Frenchman \u00c9douard-L\u00e9on Scott de Martinville invented the phonautograph. It could transcribe sound to a visible medium, but had no means to play back the sound after it was recorded. The transcriptions, known as phonautograms, were first successfully played back using computer technology in 2008 and you can hear below \u2013 this is the voice of a woman singing \u201cAu clair de la lune\u201d and it was recorded in 1860. At the time, James Buchanan was the US President and France was governed by Emperor Napoleon III.   9. Wax Paper (by Gustave Le Gray).. Although Edison claimed to have invented wax paper, he did not. Waxed paper was invented by Gustave Le Gray in 1851. Used for hand-colouration, it allowed the colour from the back of the photograph to be seen from the front. The wax paper revolutionized photography and also became a commercially successful household product for, among other things, wrapping food.  10. The Telegraph (idea by an anonymous writer at Scots Magazine in 1753 - then in 1774 George-Louis Le Sage.. realised an early electric telegraph built on the concept idea of the anonymous writer.. one wire for each of the 26 letters of the alphabet). Then a spanish polymath and scientist: Francis Salva Campillo in 1804 evolved the machine to now include all latin letters and numerals.. it was then Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmering in 1809, who made the distance those messages could be sended electrically, up to a few kilometers!.. and so.. it was passed thru several researchers (Hans Christian \u00d8rsted, Johan Schweigger, Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re, William Sturgeon, Joseph Henry, Edvard Davy, etc..). Then the \u201cfirst\u201d working telegraph was built by the English inventor Francis Ronalds in 1816 and used static electricity.. but again in 1832 it was perfected by Baron Schilling von Canstatt.. Carl Friedrich Gauss, Wilhelm Weber.. and David Alter, an American scientist, in 1836 invented the first known American electric telegraph.. one year before the Morse telegraph. Morse and his assistant Alfred Vail developed and patented a recording electric telegraph and the register.. an instrument for recording the received messages. Then.. the first commercial electrical telegraph \u201cthe Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph, was co-developed by William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone. and it went thru the years, getting improved with multiplexing and other technical stuff..  btw.. Edison were born in 1847.. and the \u201cAtlantic Telegraph Company\u201d was formed in London in 1856! (so little Edison were 8-9 years at that time). Even the first duplex and multiplex systems weren't Edison\u2019s inventions as he also claimed!.. Moses G. Farmer demonstrated duplex telegraphy between New York and Philadelphia in 1856 and patented a duplex telegraph in 1859. Edison patents are just an improvement of the duplex telegraphy in 1874. That\u2019s 15 years after Farmer and 100 years AFTER the telegraph was invented! \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 as a sad sidenote on Edison: When it was clear that AC power was a threat, Edison started a propaganda campaign against AC power, claiming that it was much more dangerous than DC power. Besides distributing pamphlets, he also set up demonstrations where he electrocuted dogs and cats to show the power of AC. He also convinced the authorities at Sing Sing to carry out death sentences not by hanging, but by AC power. Despite all of this, AC power \u2018won\u2019, and is what we use today. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Sadder sidenote: Still today, we see false attributions of inventions and we believe them.. This is horrible! We should wake up, and start making right what it\u2019s right! Here some examples (in no particular order): Computer desktop and GUI (graphical user interface): alleged inventor: Microsoft and Apple said for years it was them.. well NEITHER! the actual inventor: Xerox PARC (among others, although they were the best at it). As Walter Isaacson reported in his Steve Jobs biography, Gates responded: \"Well, Steve, I think there's more than one way of looking at it. I think it's more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox and I broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out that you had already stolen it.\" Telescope: alleged inventor: Galileo Galileiactual inventor: Hans Lippershey Automobile: alleged inventor: Henry Fordactual inventor: Karl Benz (although several other German engineers: Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach and Siegfried Marcus were also involved). Television:alleged inventor: Vladimir Zworkyin (for the RCA electronics company)actual inventor: Philo Taylor Farnsworth The Phone:alleged inventor: Alexander Graham Bellactual inventor: Elisha Gray Radio: alleged inventor: Guglielmo Marconiactual inventor: Nikola Tesla Powered flight: alleged inventor: The Wright Brothersactual inventor: Richard Pearse The Internet: alleged inventor: Al Goreactual inventors: the creators of ARPANET (Vinton Cerf, with Lawrence Roberts, Leonard Kleinrock & Robert Khan. Facebook: alleged inventor: Mark Zuckerbergactual inventors: Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss and Divya Narendra. more Facebook history?: Napster co-founders Sean Parker and Shawn Fanning, hackers and creators of the file-sharing platform for music, back in June 1999. In September 2001 they shut down its entire network in order to comply with the injunction\u2026 Agreed to pay music creators and copyright owners a $26 million settlement for past, unauthorized uses of music, and as an advance against future licensing royalties of $10 million. But, even after agreeing on that settlement, they filed for Chapter 11 protection under United States bankruptcy laws, and didn\u2019t have to pay! The company Roxio, buyed their brand and logos at bankruptcy auction.. Best Buy purchased Napster for $121 million.. and in 2016 Rhapsody, phased out the \u201crhapsody\u201d brand in favor of Napster and has since branded its service internationally as Napster. So, lets think about it for a second... In 2001\u20132002 \u201cShawn Parker & Shawn Fanning\u201d filed for bankruptcy, they were supposedly broke.. but then as Parker had been an early advisor of \u201cFriendster\u201d, the founder of this company, Jonathan Abrams, gave him a \u201csmall\u201d amount of stock in 2003 (by small.. you know.. worth millions!). Sean Parker joined the Facebook company as its president and introduced them to his close friend Peter Thiel, that became Facebook\u2019s first investor!!. Not bad for someone who filed bankruptcy a couple of years back, having friends with lots of money (lots of millions!) and invest on Facebook, instead of lending him a loan to pay what he should have paid for Napster!\u2026 ain\u2019t that peachy! Eventually in 2005, he had to resign as Facebook president, after the police raided his vacation home at a party and finding cocaine\u2026 to not splash even more the image of Mark Z. as he was also facing some legal issues, he resigned. In 2009 he invested in Spotify $15 million US dollars. So, while Napster \u201cusers\u201d were prosecuted, imprisoned and/or faced hundreds of thousands of dollars bill after federal court rulings.. the hackers and founders of the service.. NOTHING! And we can\u2019t talk about hackers and imprisonments without taking \u201cThe Pirate Bay\u201d into account. While Napster (Sean Parker and Shawn Fanning) and Kazaa (Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m and Janus Friis, later also investors of Skype) are heralded as tech visionaires, wunderkinds and \u201cpositive\u201d disruptors for their respective roles in peer-to-peer development and file-sharing, and how technology impacted users consumption of content and information.. \u2018The Pirate Bay\u2019 founder Peter Sunde was arrested and imprisoned.. although only served two-thirds of his eight-month sentence before he got released, I believe this was more of a way to disrupt his \u201cpolitical career\u201d as he was running for the European Parliament 2014 election with his \u201cPirate Party of Finland\u201d\u2026 and to be clear, it was 8 years since the Police raided The Pirate Bay servers, so\u2026 why the sudden interest? ALL in ALL.. the world is \u201cinvented\u201d by crooks!\u2026 while they get acclaimed as visionaries, there are \u201cusers\u201d of those services, fined and sentenced to jail! ",

            "answer_text": "Light Bulb The first electric light was made in 1800 by Humphry Davy, an English scientist. He experimented with electricity and invented an electric battery. When he connected wires to his battery and a piece of carbon, the carbon glowed, producing light. This is called an electric arc. later, in 1860, the English physicist Sir Joseph Wilson Swan (1828-1914) was determined to devise a practical, long-lasting electric light. He found that a carbon paper filament worked well, but burned up quickly. In 1878, he demonstrated his new electric lamps in Newcastle, England. In 1877, the American Charles Francis Brush manufactured some carbon arcs to light a public square in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. These arcs were used on a few streets, in a few large office buildings, and even some stores. Electric lights were only used by a few people. The inventor Thomas Alva Edison (in the USA) experimented with thousands of different filaments to find just the right materials to glow well and be long-lasting. In 1879, Edison discovered that a carbon filament in an oxygen-free bulb glowed but did not burn up for 40 hours. Edison eventually produced a bulb that could glow for over 1500 hours. Lewis Howard Latimer (1848-1928) improved the bulb by inventing a carbon filament (patented in 1881); Latimer was a member of Edison's research team, which was called \"Edison's Pioneers.\" In 1882, Latimer developed and patented a method of manufacturing his carbon filaments. In 1903, Willis R. Whitney invented a treatment for the filament so that it wouldn't darken the inside of the bulb as it glowed. In 1910, William David Coolidge (1873-1975) invented a tungsten filament which lasted even longer than the older filaments. The incandescent bulb revolutionized the world. ",
