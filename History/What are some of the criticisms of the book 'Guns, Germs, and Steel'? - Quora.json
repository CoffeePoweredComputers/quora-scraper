            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to add to the other criticisms here\u2026 He doesn\u2019t discuss the importance of the movable type printing press and the Protestant reformation. One of the most important tenants from the Protestant Reformation (Luther, Calvin, etc) is the concept of the priesthood of all believers. The relevant Bible passage cited by Protestant Christians is 1 Peter 2:5\u20139: \"You also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ \u2026 But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light\" Martin Luther thought that \u201cthis word priest should become as common as the word Christian\u201d because all Christians are priests. What does it take to be a priest? A priest has to be intimately familiar with one\u2019s professed religion. In the case of Christianity, that means familiarity with the Bible. This means that the ordinary person, to fulfill this demand, must be literate. Given that the Bible is written in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek which are dead languages for Western Europeans at the time, the Bible needed to be translated into living languages. The first substantial book printed by Gutenberg, in 1454 or 1455, on his movable metal type press was the Bible, translated into German. Especially amongst Protestants, there was a demand for Bibles, Psalters and other religious tracts, printed relatively cheaply (that is, when compared to the hand copied Bibles). These materials were affordable to those in the merchant class, artisans and yeomen. A direct consequence of the concept of \u2018Priesthood of all Believers\u2019 is that Believers must be literate, must be able to read the Bible for themselves and think for themselves. This means that more people want to be literate and want to make sure their children (especially boys) are literate. When books are affordable and people are literate, it is now much easier for people to share knowledge, to engage in mass communication. European languages derived from or influenced by Latin, have reasonably strong phoneme - graphene connection and were written, letter by letter, in such a way that it was relatively easy to develop reusable type. The other languages widely spoken (and sometimes read) in the fifteenth century were not as conductive being printed. Another consequence of the concept of \u2018Priesthood of all Believers\u2019 is that believers had a responsibility to think critically about what they read and heard. Challenging authority not only is possible, but in many circumstances, is expected. The printing press now meant that European societies developed a \u2018marketplace for ideas\u2019; hence, ushered in the Enlightenment\u2026. \u201cand now you know the rest of the story\u2026\u201d\u2014Paul Harvey ",

            "answer_text": " Jared Diamond\u2019s \u2018Guns, germs and Steel\u2019 is a decent book with a laudable aim; to disavow any lingering notions of Western superiority in history. It is strangely ironic that Western Intellectuals have gone from measuring their skull capacity to prove their inherent racial superiority (as did the infamous \u2018Anthropological Society of London\u2019) to bending over backwards to show that the decadent denizens of the West are mental pygmies compared to the New Guinean hunters as Diamond himself holds.  According to Diamond it was bio-geographical factors that enabled the rise of the Eurasia and allowed its western stub to colonise the unfortunate inhabitants of the Americas, Australasia and Africa. Eurasia contained a large number of wild plants and animals that could be domesticated (barley; wheat ; three protein-rich pulses; flax; goats, sheep, donkeys cattle and horses). By contrast the Americas and Australia lost the animals that could have been domesticated to early hunters.  All this is undoubtedly true and enormously helpful in explaining how Eurasia got a head start. Indeed the domination of Eurasia is entirely unsurprising when you consider that, due to the factors highlighted by Diamond, it has accounted for some eighty percent of humankind over the past 3,000 years, and probably well before that. This concentration of population ultimately led to more competition, the faster spread of technology and the accumulation of disease immunities.  The really interesting question is why has it been Europe and not another part of Eurasia that that went on to dominate the rest of the world? Here is where Jared Diamond\u2019s theory of bio-geographical determinism starts to run into difficulties. The problem is that there are really few profound differences between the eastern and western areas of what might be termed Eurasia. Both regions adopted agriculture, market-based economies and large cities. Jared Diamond in his later writings (it is something he only briefly touches upon in \u2018Guns. Germs and Steel\u2019) attributes the relative decline of the eastern area to the fact that the plains of the Orient facilitated the creation of large monolithic empire that tended to stifle innovation (If I recall correctly this is an idea borrowed from Paul Kennedy\u2019s \u2018Rise and Fall of the Great Powers\u2019) By contrast the west was mountainous and divided by rivers; therefore multiple monarchies and city states emerged that would tend to compete.  Europe is divided into five relative isolated peninsulas (e.g Britain, Spain, and Italy are all walled off) while China is bound together from east to west by two long navigable river systems. China\u2019s rounder coastline favoured centralised rulers over petty princes and favoured political unity.  There is probably something in this, but as an all-encompassing thesis it falls a bit flat. Political fragmentation is not necessarily an advantage, indeed in some circumstances, such as the presence of a powerful and aggressive neighbour, it is a weakness. India for example has been politically fragmented for most of its long recorded history to its great detriment. Competition between European states was often disastrous and \u2013 in the case of Germany during the 30 years war \u2013 caused catastrophic de-population through warfare and disease.  Political unity hasn\u2019t always an innovation-killer. The obvious counter-example is provided by the Roman Empire which accomplished a number of impressive technological feats before descending into political chaos in the 3rd Century AD.  The fact is that the ancient civilizations of the Near East, India, China, and Asia had more or less the same advantages and disadvantages in resources and location. If one were to place bets on what would become the dominant civilisation in 800AD it would most likely be China and certainly not Western Europe. Instead - according to Angus Maddison\u2019s estimates, the western European population leapt from a low of 18,600,000 to 58,353,000 in 1300 and overtook China in GDP per capita. In 1300 Western Europe was by far the richest part of the world with most of the wealth  concentrated in a band running along the continent from south-east England to northern Italy. After a contraction caused by the Black Death the European economic expansion continued while other parts of the world stagnated.  The explanation for this is probably partially bio-geographical (Kenneth Pomeranz draws attention to the more plentiful and better located coal deposits in Western Europe) but mainly institutional; Niall Fergusson\u2019s \u2018killer apps\u2019 of competition, the scientific revolution, the rule of law and representative government, modern medicine, the consumer society and the work ethic (intensive labour + high savings rates) Even so, the world ten biggest cities in 1500 were all in the east. One could imagine an alternate scenario where China did not experience severe disruptions such as the collapse of the Ming dynasty in the mid-seventeenth century or undertook the reforms that Japan did following the Commodore Perry mission.
