            "answer_text": "BC and AD.?? (CE and BCE.??) The Roman Catholic Church was the dominating force to reconcile the dating of events of the ancient political Roman Empire with the later universal faith of the Holy Roman Empire. (As an example, consider the intersecting time-lines of various Roman political leaders mentioned in the Bible book of Luke, chapter 3, verses 1-2) The Catholic Church used the birth of Jesus as a focal point by dating the years since then with the term A.D. \u201canno domini\"\u2026 meaning in the Year of our Lord, and BC for Before Christ. (But, don't forget that other cultures have their old traditional calendars. For example, the Jewish calendar starts with man being created almost 6,000 years ago, but China counts more than 4,000 years now on their traditional calendar, perhaps starting after the Great Flood.) The beginning year of the Common Era (C.E.) usually known as A.D., is not exact because it is focused on (approximately) the birth of Jesus Christ but records were lost in later wars. Notice that some encyclopedias say that Jesus was born, perhaps, in the year 8 BC, but others say 6 or 4 or 2 BC. Why? This may be due to a Roman ordered Census of Judea that was repeated more than once but close to the death of a Judean King named Herod. Some confusion in dating has arisen because Judea had more than one king with the same name Herod\u2026 so the timing of Jesus birth may have been 2 BC or even back to 8 BC.!.? It is also likely that there was more than one Census, perhaps every other year, 2 years apart, in order to match the years 2, 4, 6 and 8 BC. Not all historians agree exactly on the year of Jesus\u2019 birth back then, so today they call this time period as the \u2018common era'. Many nations that are Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist or atheist, don't recognize Jesus as their Lord. So, the expression Common Era is less religious, but more secular, as a reference for global chronology today. Thus, most of the world\u2019s nations now commonly accept this present year as 2020 C.E. Finally, what was so \u201ccommon\" about the Common Era (CE) ?? About 2,000 years ago, the Roman Empire had trading records related to business, explorations and political dealings, wars and treaties with nations from Europe, Asia and Africa. Therefore, historical events on 3 continents helped to identify that time period as a \u201ccommon era\u201d during the time of the Caesars.\u201d But centuries later, the Catholic Church focused on Jesus Christ's birth year as the pivotal year by the terms AD and BC. P.S. The ancient way of dating many monarchies and dynasties was based on just historical events of local leaders, similar to the Bible reference above, (See Luke 3:1-2) For other examples: \u201cIn the 8th year of the first Ming Dynasty in China\u2026\u201d Or: \u201cIn the third year of Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II\u201d\u2026or \u201cIn the second year of Alexander the Great\u2026\u201d etc. So, no global calendar existed way back then to record events using an internationally accepted chronology of world history.

            "answer_text": "Pope Gregory XIII introduced the calendar we widely use and hence the name, Gregorian. It was introduced in 1582. So everyone was aware of when Christ was born. However, practice of BC and AD pre-existed. A Roman monk named Dionysius Exiguus set up the \"AD\" system in about 500 CE. AD stands for Anno Domini which simply means 'The year of lord' and it refers to the year when Jesus Christ was born.  He worked backward using Biblical texts to estimate when he thought Jesus was born.  Then about 700 CE, Bede the Venerable called the time before AD \"ante uero incarnationis dominicae tempus,\" which is Latin for 'the time before the Lord's true incarnation'. Our English equivalent to that Latin phrase is \"Before Christ. BC\"  So the short answer to your question is: Dionysius Exiguus gave us AD in 500 CE.Venerable Bede gave us BC in 700 CE.Pope Gregory XIII gave us the calendar which we preferably use.If you are left wondering what is CE, then you have thought for new quora question. ref: I have collaged the information from Anno Domini and  When was the term BC (before Christ) first used and by whom was it used.?
