            "answer_text": "She is already an historical figure, not only for her youth, but also her intelligence, the manner of her election victory and the movement of which she is a part. In terms of history, she is the American equivalent of Bernadette (Devlin) McAliskey. She at the time was the youngest member of the British Parliament upon her election at age 22 in 1969. Like AOC, she represented a minority (Catholics) in Northern Ireland. She is fiery, a socialist, and was denounced for both by a very conservative establishment. However, it turned out that it would be her vision rather than that of the Protestant conservatives that would finally bring peace to her homeland. When she toured the US, she was most sympathetic with black people, including the Black Panthers. She said it was they rather than Irish descended Americans who were oppressed the way that Catholics were oppressed in Northern Ireland. She recognized the same majority attitudes in both countries. There are of course differences. Bernadette couldn\u2019t live with her companion, and her eventual pregnancy caused a scandal. In deference to him, she didn\u2019t reveal his name in public. She was a promising student but the university forced her out for her activism. By contrast, AOC was 29 upon her election to the US Congress. She and her companion are open about their relationship, and it isn\u2019t considered \u201cscandalous.\u201d In addition, AOC has always been quite a scholar. Before anybody knew who she was, she won Second Prize at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair for her high school biology project. The work was of such prestige that MIT\u2019s Lincoln Laboratory arranged to have Asteroid 23238 Ocasio-Cortez named in her honor. When she graduated from Boston College, her degree was issued Cum Laud in both Economics and International Relations. She honed her speaking skills by participating in various assemblies. She is entirely fluent and eloquent in both English and Spanish. She is not famous for merely being the youngest Congress person. To get there, she won an epic come-from-behind primary victory against a twenty year incumbent. The pre-election polls didn\u2019t predict it because she mobilized new voters who the polls had ignored. Further, it\u2019s obvious that she is deeply feared by her conservative opponents. The huge amount of propaganda they generate denouncing her as a \u201cyoung airheaded Latina\u201d is a backhanded compliment. Bernadette McAliskey is now in her seventies and long out of parliament. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is just beginning her career. Neither is popular just for being \u201cthe youngest member.\u201d Both have been movement leaders popular way beyond legislating. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is the way to determine who is historically important: if they are dead, but you still read or hear about the things that they did that affect you, they are historically important. Notice the first requirement: they are dead. AOC is very much alive. If she accomplishes things that cause your grandchildren to know who she is after she passes away because of something she did or said, she will be a historic figure. Examples: Frederick Douglass was famous in the mid-19th century. His biography is still read, many of his statements are still quoted. He is a historic figure. Thurlow Weed was also famous in the mid-19th century. He was a famous political tactician, who had great political influence and was frequently mentioned in the news media of the time (newspapers and magazines). About the only mention he has had in modern culture: In the TV comedy \u201cPetticoat Junction,\u201d the Thurlow Weed room was the most deluxe accommodation in the ancient rundown Shady Rest Hotel in Hooterville, MO. Despite this well-deserved tribute, Thurlow Weed is NOT a historically important person. ",
