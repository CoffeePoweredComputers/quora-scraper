            "answer_text": " By the end of his brilliant and tortured life, the Serbian physicist, engineer and inventor Nikola Tesla was penniless and living in a small New York City hotel room. He spent days in a park surrounded by the creatures that mattered most to him\u2014pigeons\u2014and his sleepless nights working over mathematical equations and scientific problems in his head. That habit would confound scientists and scholars for decades after he died, in 1943. His inventions were designed and perfected in his imagination. Tesla believed his mind to be without equal, and he wasn\u2019t above chiding his contemporaries, such as Thomas Edison But what his contemporaries may have been lacking in scientific talent (by Tesla\u2019s estimation), men like Edison and George clearly possessed the one trait that Tesla did not\u2014a mind for business. And in the last days of America\u2019s Gilded Age, Nikola Tesla made a dramatic attempt to change the future of communications and power transmission around the world. He managed to convince JP MORGAN that he was on the verge of a breakthrough, and the financier gave Tesla more than $150,000 to fund what would become a gigantic, futuristic and startling tower in the middle of Long Island, New York. In 1898, as Tesla\u2019s plans to create a worldwide wireless transmission system became known, Wardenclyffe Tower would be Tesla\u2019s last chance to claim the recognition and wealth that had always escaped him.  White quickly got to work designing Wardenclyffe Tower in 1901, but soon after construction began it became apparent that Tesla was going to run out of money before it was finished. An appeal to Morgan for more money proved fruitless, and in the meantime investors were rushing to throw their money behind Marconi. In December 1901, Marconi successfully sent a signal from England to Newfoundland. Tesla grumbled that the Italian was using 17 of his patents, but litigation eventually favored Marconi and the commercial damage was done. (The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately upheld Tesla\u2019s claims, clarifying Tesla\u2019s role in the invention of the radio\u2014but not until 1943, after he died.) Thus the Italian inventor was credited as the inventor of radio and became rich. Wardenclyffe Tower became a 186-foot-tall relic (it would be razed in 1917), and the defeat\u2014Tesla\u2019s worst\u2014led to another of his breakdowns. \u201dIt is not a dream,\u201d Tesla said, \u201cit is a simple feat of scientific electrical engineering, only expensive\u2014blind, faint-hearted, doubting world!\u201d By 1912, Tesla began to withdraw from that doubting world. He was clearly showing signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder, and was potentially a high-functioning autistic. He became obsessed with cleanliness and fixated on the number three; he began shaking hands with people and washing his hands\u2014all done in sets of three. He had to have 18 napkins on his table during meals, and would count his steps whenever he walked anywhere. He claimed to have an abnormal sensitivity to sounds, as well as an acute sense of sight, and he later wrote that he had \u201ca violent aversion against the earrings of women,\u201d and \u201cthe sight of a pearl would almost give me a fit.\u201d Near the end of his life, Tesla became fixated on pigeons, especially a specific white female, which he claimed to love almost as one would love a human being.

            "answer_text": "Nikola Tesla died with free rent and a pension of $125 which is quite a lot in today\u2019s dollars\u2026 far more than millions of US seniors today have. He had many patents but were nothing compared to the $50,000 ($12M today) that Edison bilked him out of for successfully doing what Edison was incapable of. That was a practical joke according to Tesla because he took Edison at his word, being a trusting immigrant\u2026a verbal contract to which Edison said only that he needs to learn about \u2018the American sense of humor.\u2019 He left him out with no compensation. Zero. Now jobless, he was relegated to digging ditches for two years to sustain himself. It didn\u2019t make him bitter. Real Humor: Tesla made the DC motors that Edison depended on but couldn\u2019t make himself or fix. Then he improved them and then utterly surpassed DC technology altogether. That is nothing in comparison to the amount of money he would\u2019ve have received from other ventures and especially the Westinghouse Electric company offering $2.50 per kilowatt of AC power plus $2000 a year (a nice salary over 6 figures in today\u2019s dollar). It would\u2019ve made him a billionaire except\u2026 He turned it down! But why? Edison did everything he could to prevent Westinghouse Electric from beating the Edison Electric Co. which Tesla made operable and better for free. Still, the strain of Edison\u2019s lawsuits and thugs hurt Westinghouse. Tesla, out of kindness, tore up the contract. Both men knew what Edison was and how much power he held. Would you trade your dream for money? Then a third time, Tesla\u2019s lab burned to the ground, vanquishing his immediate goals and he suffered a nervous breakdown. Despite Edison\u2019s animal-killing displays, no one worried about the safety of AC and Westinghouse, with Tesla\u2019s help, eventually won.  The Columbian Exposition (Columbus) World\u2019s Fair in Chicago in 1893 proved it to all the most important and influential people in attendance and millions of visitors which catapulted the technology.  World\u2019s fairs were enormous and like most large events, limited to daytime hours. Until the power required to keep it going at night was available\u2014Westinghouse power run by Tesla AC technology. People were astonished it was possible. Again, Edison being an abysmal person tried to prevent it saying they could not use his bulbs believing that doing so made it impossible to lose. So a different light bulb was invented In short order\u2014not a difficult problem. Voila!  After that, Edison went on tour electrocuting everything he could get a hold of, and imported elephants just to fry them in public, and make AC seem dangerous in the most gruesome promotional aberration of modern times. You can watch him electrocuting animals for no reason online. He tried to use safety as a reason to support DC\u2014an impossibly expensive process of having power plants on every block\u2026a stupid proposition that nevertheless would have made him and his investors billions upon billions. Irony. This led to Edison\u2019s truly original invention (clearly self-inspired, not stolen or borrowed) the electric chair, was a hit with executioners but used AC not DC current. He secretly used a Westinghouse generator in violation of patent law which he tried to use against Westinghouse to stop illumination of the fair. (Edison never really invented anything by himself. Not the light bulb, nothing). Tesla, in contrast, provided all the brain power of everything he invented. He was obviously a unique individual who did not care so much more about money or grudges as he did in his discovery process which he did in his head and his lab\u2026All his money went to his life\u2019s passion, a good use of it. The first ever hydroelectric plant (he invented) at Niagara Falls had no plans or blueprints. He just directed its construction and wasn\u2019t furtive or paranoid (though he should\u2019ve been protective, his intellect obviated the need). Workers quickly constructed it and AC power was transmitted 26 miles to Buffalo NY making AC a reality for mankind on November 15, 1896.  A person of this extraordinary level of intelligence will display irrational or eccentric behaviour\u2026count on it. Tesla walked around his apartment building 9 times before entering and exiting it. He washed every dish 9 times. Mathematically, the number 9 to those inclined with numbers, is the only number to which all others lead. Not making this up\u2026it\u2019s true. If I had to do those odd things every day to have the natural ability to see things no else could do or did, I would. Who wouldn\u2019t? He invented an X-ray machine before Wilhelm Roentgen announced he had done it. That discovery which made Roentgen\u2019s entire career, Tesla just considered a nice trick with Mark Twain, an amazed witness and friend.  X-ray of Tesla\u2019s own hand before its credited inventor, Roentgen reported his discovery. This would have made him another fortune and earned him a Nobel Prize or share of one. But he wasn\u2019t a recluse or insane\u2026he enjoyed dinner parties and socialising with the elite of New York City. He was considered among the most eligible bachelors in the US. He earned the following accolades in his storied, if controversial, life. Despite the constant antagonism against him by Edison, and a nervous breakdown after his lab was burned down, a stack of patents and original inventions led to the following none of which can be purchased with any amount of money: Grand Officer of the Order of St. Sava (Serbia, 1892)Honoris Doctor: Yale University 1893Elliott Cresson Medal (Franklin Institute, USA, 1894)[185]Honoris Doctor: Columbia University 1894.Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Danilo I (Montenegro, 1895)[186]AIEE Edison Medal (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, USA, 1917)[187]Grand Cross of the Order of St. Sava (Yugoslavia, 1926)[188]Cross Cross of the Order of the Yugoslav Crown (Yugoslavia, 1931)John Scott Medal (Franklin Institute & Philadelphia City Council, USA, 1934)[185]Grand Cross of the Order of the White Lion (Czechoslovakia, 1937)[189]Medal of the University of Paris (Paris, France, 1937)The Medal of the University St. Clement of Ochrida (Sofia, Bulgaria, 1939)To win all of this as a scientist is a damn good assessment of a brilliant and rewarding career and honorary degrees from top schools at such a young age\u2026Just having that many publications is a dream to most scientists. His journal of inventions was no secret as many claim. For 40 years, it stood as the textbook for practically all electrical engineers. He helped humanity save so much time and labor, and made clear that it was his goal to do so. Just one of his inventions changed world history. What a rich life: Imagine being a worldwide legend in your own time. He was. He wanted to help the average person live an easier life and he did it many times over. One cannot overstate the importance of AC power and his other inventions to the daily lives of\u2026everyone alive. George Westinghouse, his friend and former collaborator, saw to his needs for the rest of his life. He wan\u2019t homeless or penniless, that\u2019s a prevarication\u2026he lived in the Waldorf-Astoria then the Hotel New Yorker until he passed. On the occasion of his 75th birthday, Albert Einstein congratulated him for this:  Times Man of the Year: The Man Who Powered the World If you mean, why didn\u2019t Tesla die with more money? Mainly Thomas Edison and others who recognized and immediately feared his genius were engaged in war. But he won. He\u2019s an American hero. The people who took advantage of his good nature died with more money but you can\u2019t take that with you. You can just leave a legacy of accomplishment and relationships. People realize Edison tried to keep Nikola Tesla down and is the direct cause of lost fortunes and opportunities from the day they met. Like every person, he had his share of ups and downs but in the end, what worked changed the world. What didn\u2019t is a detail. Compare people to their accomplishments. ",
