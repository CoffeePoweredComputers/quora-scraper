In fairness, I don\u2019t think I expressed that answer terribly well so let me try to do better. A nucleotide is the complete building block for either DNA or RNA. It consists of a nucleobase, (generally Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, Cytosine or Uracil), attached to a five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose) and a phosphate group A nucleoside is the part made of the nucleobase and the sugar. The phosphate groups polymerise together to make the backbone of the DNA or RNA strand. The nucleobases join with hydrogen bonds to other nucleobases to make base pairs. In general, I usually just refer to nucleotides, and I use the short names of the nucleobases to refer to them. That\u2019s probably bad form and proper biochemists probably wince when they read it - perhaps some actual biochemists could chip in and correct me. ",
