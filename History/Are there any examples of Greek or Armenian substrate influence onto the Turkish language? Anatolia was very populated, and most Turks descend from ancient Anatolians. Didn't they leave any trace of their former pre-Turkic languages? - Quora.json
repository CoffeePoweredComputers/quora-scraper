            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Several questions and assertions. Are there any examples of Greek or Armenian substrate influence onto the Turkish language? There are hundreds of Greek and Armenian words in Turkish. Much less than Turkish words in Greek and Armenian, even left overs from systematic cleansing, but still Turkish has some, less than 5 percent. (see at the end) There is also a heavy influence in slang because metropolitan crime and nightlife during the Ottomans was disproportionately Greek and Armenian managed. Anatolia was very populated, and most Turks descend from ancient Anatolians. That is a common misconception about the word descended. Turks are descended from Anatolian Roman citizens as well as Turks, Central Asians, Iranians, Mongolians, Chinese, Arabs, Finns, Slavs, Hungarians, Italians. When modern Turks visited Anatolia the last time and settled, that was 40 generations ago, and they had 2^40 slots for their ancestral trees in year 1071. You had every nation there. You are (whoever you are does not matter, if you are a Peruvian or Tamil) descended from Turks too. There is almost zero probability that you do not have a Turkish ancestor who fought in the Battle of Manzikert in your 2^40 slots in the ancestral tree. So, no they are not only descended from Anatolians. Didn't they leave any trace of their former pre-Turkic languages? I just explained Greek and Armenian, the two lingua franca languages of the area did. But what is interesting here is what happened to the pre-Roman languages of Anatolia. What happened to Hittite, Frigian, Lidian, Lician, Urartu, and tens of others. They probably disappeared under Roman citizenship, which adopted Greek language and Orthodox Christianity. Later on, even if they were of different ethnicities, all Orthodox Christians, Romans as they were called until 19th century, and Hellenes (Greeks, or Yunan) after the 19th century, even if they did not speak Greek and were sent to Greece in population exchange and if they had another language it was corrected there. Or they were corrected a thousand years before under the Imperium Romanum. Hard to say. Common Turkish words from Greek and Armenian My compilation of commonly used Greek loan words in Turkish.

This is funny. Firstly there are modern genetics (you can get through family tree dna and co), they show clear affinities between Turks and Azerbaijanis or Central Asian Turkmens at different level. Another point is that when the republic of Turkey was established in 1923, the first population census revealed that Turkey had a population of 13 million in 1923. Note that Turkey had already received immigrations from Balkans and Caucasus (Circassians) back then. Did the population of Turkey really stay stable over the past 900 years (1070\u2019s to 1920\u2019s), considering that no mass genocide or pandemy (like black death in Euroope) never occured in between? When Turks arrived they found a scarcely populated Anatolia. That\u2019s the reality. And that\u2019s why languages like Greek, Armenian or Georgian have no effect (save some words in vocabulary) on the Turkish language. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Greek and Armenian (but especially Greek), however, contributed to the Turkish slang. Armenian was never a prestige language for Turks (unlike Farsi and Arabic). Greek? To some extent. Given that most of the Christianity-related terms are Greek, it seems the Greek language had a very minor field of influence. The new words that are of Greek origin but derived or fabricated by non-Greek scientists and scholars such as from France, England, USA, and Germany (like biology) are a lot more than the direct loans from Greek. This is my claim but the dative forms of singular you (sen) and I (ben) in Turkish, i.e. sana (to you) and bana (to me) might have been influenced by Greek \u201csena\u201d (\u03c3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1) and \u201cmena\u201d (\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1) as such forms do not exist in other Turkic languages.

            "answer_text": "Not much in standard Turkish, past a few words like \u201cR\u00fbm\u201d or \u201cK\u00e2yser,\u201d which aren't even taken from modern Greek but Roman (Byzantine) Greek. Greece used to be referred to as \u201cRome\u201d by the Byzantines, where the term R\u00fbm comes from in Turkish (actually coming from Greek to Arabic to Turkish haha). Even then, the terms are pretty Antiquated in modern Turkish though they do exist. However Turkey is a large country, and there are many regional dialects. In the black sea region for example, the native dialect has many Greek words infused into its lexicon, as the region was traditionally populated by pontic Greeks. You can see similar situations in Cretian and Cypriot Turkish. I don't know much about dialects spoken in EAST east Turkey, ergo Kars, Erzurum, where Armenians traditionally populated but I would venture a guess that some Armenian (and Kurdish) words find their ways into the regional dialects.

            "answer_text": "Turkish is an Altaic language as Mongolic, Manzhu-Tunguzic. But Greek, Armenian and Old Anatolian languages (Phrigian, Lydian, Hittite) are Indo-European language. Although Turkish have many Armenian and Greek loanwords. Because before Turks, there was Greeks and Armenians in Anatolia. But Turkish never affected from old Anatolian languages. Bcs Turks when conquered Anatolia in 1071 and there was just Greeks and Armenians in Anatolia. ",
