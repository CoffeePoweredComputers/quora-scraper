            "answer_text": "Before Germany German nationalism became a thing after the Napoleonic wars. Before that Germany was just a geographical concept an mayby not even that. People in common were likely to identify with a nationality derived from the old German tribes.  Each duchy created its own nationality.  What was to become Germany was once political divided What united people in what was to become Germany was not culture or religion but only the language, and only the written language created by Martin Luther. People who did speak different languages were united in a common system of spelling, easily accessible in the nearest Bible. French colonial rule The Napoleonic conquest was not a pleasant experience. Napoleon believed that all people would be positive to be promoted to French and indeed the German kings and nobility wear eager to sell out to the French Empire. Common people who did not speak French was not that enthusiastic over being converted to a strange and foreign culture. French rule was not doing much to promote imperial rule from Paris. For the commoners it ment being deprived of all wealth to finance Napoleons war. Having your son conscripted to a suicidal mission like invading Russia (why?) and having your daughter repeatedly raped by French soldiers that you were forced to house. Not a positive experience. The invention of Germany After the fall of Napoleon most people just wanted to go back to their old way of life but some worried: What if the French come back? Next time we may not have the fortune that the French Empire collapse. The ruler who had sold out to Napoleon had lost all credibility. Some intellectuals came up with a new idea. A new political entity should be formed by uniting all people who used the German language. OK. It was only a written language but people could be taught to speak properly. A new state should be formed by the German people: Das Deutsches Volk. This was a new idea. Politics used to be the struggles of different dynasties. The new idea was to build a nation from bottom and up. German nationalism was about democracy and civil rights. The political elite hated it. Their attidude was expressed by Friedrich Wilhelm IV: Gegen Demokraten helfen nur Soldaten. Nationalism was a threat to everyone who feared democracy. The German dream was: One State. Ruled by its citizens. United by one common language. Problems with nationalism The problem was to define the borders of the new entity: Germany. For the intellectuals who were driving the process it seemed easy. Germany was the dominating language in their world of books and universities but there was a world outside of Akademia. There were people who lived in rural lands and spoke no german at all. The problem was obvious in a country like B\u00f6hmen. Germany dominated in the towns and in Prague but the people of the land were Czechs. In the same way there were other minorities in the east like Poles and Magyars. The German language was even commonly used by intellectuals in Russia. In the west lived German speaking peoples under French rule. People who spoke German but considered themselves to be French. A special case was Schleswig-Holstein. It was ruled by the Danish king who ruled as a duke in the two duchies that were united into one political entity. Schleswig was Danish. Holstein was German. The people were Danish and German at the same time. They spoke both languages and used them in different situations, like Danish ar home and German when shopping. Small German solution Some argued for a Greater Germany solution. All land with a German population, even if it was just a small minority should be part of Germany. Other promoted a small German solution. Only areas with a solid German majority should be part of Germany. Bismarck was devoted to the idea of a small German solution. He wanted to create a German Empire with no ethnic minorities. If possible areas populated by non German people should not be part of Germany. He even excluded the German speaking land ruled by the Habsburg dynasty. The Nazi Empire Nazism was an ideology that rejected the small German solution. All land with a German population should be part of Germany. Non German people should be murdered or enslaved. The Nazist also rejected democracy. Collecting all German people in a single unit was not about creating the foundation for democracy but for totalitarian rule by a tyrannical regime. Contemporary German nationalism The failure of the evil Nazi Empire has brought German nationalism in disrepute. Germans has returned to their old nationalities. They prefer their local identity over their German identity. They also distrust other Germans who are a strange people being Catholics/Protestants and progressives/reactionaries. Germany is so diversed that there is a Germany to fear for everyone. The solution has been federalism. Germany is considered a collection of countries, L\u00e4nder, united in a covenant. Several people who share a common national football team. ",
