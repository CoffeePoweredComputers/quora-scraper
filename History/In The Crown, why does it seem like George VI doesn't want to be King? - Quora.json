            "answer_text": "Because he didn\u2019t want to be. He wasn\u2019t supposed to be king. His elder brother David, who became King Edward VIII and subsequently abdicated, becoming the Duke of Windsor, was supposed to be King all along. David was groomed and raised to be King. At every step since childhood he was being modeled and readied to become king. His brother Albert, known as Bertie by the family, was able to live his life as he wished without being worried about becoming king. There were warning signs all along that David didn\u2019t want to become king, Chief among them his petulant and churlish behavior. His father, King George V, dreaded his son David would inherit the throne and wished Bertie would. Ultimately that is what happened but only after Edward VIII\u2019s disastrously short reign. As a result Bertie, now George VI, was completely unprepared the be king. He had vague ideas of what to job entailed and wisely chose very sage advisors. But he had little grasp of the British Constituion and how the levers of government all worked. He made Certain his daughter Princess, and now our Queen, Elizabeth was well schooled in that regard so when she became Queen she was more adequately prepared. People will ask, \u201cwell why wasn\u2019t Bertie better prepared?\u201d Think of this. You\u2019re David and you see your fathers advisors scholar in general your younger brother Bertie. You'd be pissed. They\u2019re trying to bypass you, to usurp the throne with him on it. This isn\u2019t the Palace, you have to realize. Things are done a certain way. ",

He had a very traditionalist view of the importance of a regular succession, and was appalled at the instability introduced by Wallis Simpson. Additionally, as a personal thing, he felt gravely unqualified to assume the crown, inasmuch as he was deeply introverted and possessed of a severe stammer which made public speaking a horrid trial. He was entirely content to live in the background with a loving and supportive family - he only agreed to assume the crown because a profound sense of duty, something his brother conspicuously lacked.
