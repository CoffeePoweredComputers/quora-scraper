Also most \u201cleper\u2019s\u201d although disfigured by the disease have actually been cured, so they are no longer carriers. Also, Leprosy is of the same family as Tuberculosis and if you have been vaccinated against one, it provides some protection against the other. In colder climates, where TB is more prevalent, Leprosy is rare and vice versa. Which is why Leprosy was always fairly rare in Northern Europe - we tended to get TB (consumption) instead. ",
