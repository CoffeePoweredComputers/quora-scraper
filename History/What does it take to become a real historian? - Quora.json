            "answer_text": "Professor Tony Pollard, the top academic historian in the UK, told me once, \u201cYou don't need a PhD or a degree to be a historian\u2026 you just need to be right.\u201d A real historian is someone who can produce good history and back it up. Personally, I'd say also someone who isn't afraid to question everything, to throw out the \u201creliable\u201d sources if the evidence is against them, and also, perhaps most importantly, who isn't afraid to start again if, even on the very last page of your book or thesis, something comes up which changes the result\u2026 I've done it a few times myself. We historians are never bigger than the history we tell. I'd say that the ultimate is in self discipline, in never trying to prove a case, but just going with the evidence. Always question everything, and yourself twice as much, and accept that only the truth matters. Bias, especially our own, is the enemy of history. Oh and one last thing: it's not a popularity contest, so if the whole world says you're wrong, but you know you're right, you stand there and defy the lot of them! So long as you can back your findings and evidence up, you do it, and the others can look out for themselves. Degrees and doctorates be damned, a real historian is one who produces real history. And here's what I did without the advantages of academia, just to prove the point. This is how you become a real historian\u2026 lots of hard work and saying yes to everything!!

            "answer_text": "I think Ms. Gilbert points us in a useful direction. Being a 'real' historian is more about asking beautiful questions than it is about having all the answers. Without good questions there are no good answers. What makes a question beautiful? In simple terms, a beautiful questions gets to the heart of a matter. It elicits meaning and interpretation rather than simply a random collection of facts. And you learn to ask beautiful questions by reading and learning and engaging with historical conversations. Because history is not the work of lone wolves scribbling down discovered facts, it's about dozens and hundreds of people involved in an evolving dialogue about how to make sense of a common set of events, processes, interpretations, methods, ironies, etc. A beautiful question moves the dialogue in interesting and unexpected ways...  The best way to engage in these conversations? Get a PhD.  I would say that the jump from a BA in history to a PhD in history is as great as the leap from first grade to freshman year of college. ",
