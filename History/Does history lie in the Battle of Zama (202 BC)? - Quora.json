So, there are three possibilities; the entire historical record of the Roman Republic was an elaborate lie based on some grand conspiracy; history is correct about the Battle of Zama; there are minor factual errors meant to aggrandize the Romans that don\u2019t really matter. You can pick the one that sounds most likely. ",
