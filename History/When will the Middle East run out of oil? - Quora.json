            "answer_text": "I am considering the meaning of oil lasting to be the time when oil is no longer technically recoverable. By technical recovery I mean to say that the energy needed to extract and refine 1 barrel of oil will be equal or greater than energy released by the final oil products worth 1 barrel of crude oil. Immaterial of what the cost of oil be, it will be unfeasible at this time. One may still get some amount of oil just for the sake of defense aircrafts, missiles etc by using energy from coal to power the extraction but that will not be possible in industrial scale, in the excess of 100 thousand barrel per day as coal is also finite and it will be meaningless for anyone to use energy from oil instead of energy from coal Now, about the oil in Mid east, the countries in mid east have not disclosed their oil reserves for a long time and have kept the reserves same for over 30 years without discovering any new field despite extracting billions of barrels of oil Lets take the case if KSA(saudi arabia). In 87, it was 170 billion barrels and suddenly became 266 billion barrels in 89 and it is same even today. My calculations is that KSA oil in place in 1970 as per US companies report who were co-owners of ARAMCO back then, was 530 bbl. Of this, the initial recovery percentage was expected to be 30% and hence estimated at 170 billion barrels. However, with EOR techniques it was found that the recovery could be 55\u201360%. Even if we assume best case 65%, the oil extractable in 1970 will be 330 billion barrels. From 1970 to today 150 Billion barrels have been extracted. So, remaining is 180 billion barrels. At 10.5 million barrels per day, the annual extraction will be 4bbl. So, 45 years is what KSA oil will last. Iranian natural gas and oil are also going yo last 50\u201355 years. Kuwait oil was likewise estimated to be 48 billion barrels in 2006 by oil intelligence journalists. It has annual production of 1 billion barrels and has by now 37 billion barrels of oil. This will last only 40 years. Iraq produces 2 billion barrels of oil per annum and has reseeves of 100 billion barrels which will last 50 years. Abu dhabi has oil of 50 billion barrels at 1 billion barrels annual production and will last 50 years. The figures are based on 1980 reserves of these countries doubled to reflect the advanced techniques of extraction and subtracted by total amount of oil extracted till date. I have purposely made the figures quite generous as I wanted to have the best case scenario as the data is patchy. The oil discovery is ruled out as entire middle east was scavenged in the 1970s after the 1973 gulf blockade and all the oil fields were discovered completely in all the gulf nations excepting IRAQ as all the gulf nations except iraq had US puppet government (including iran) till I 970s and the American companies were allowed to explore the region. The maximum oil can last is 2070 at current production rate in mid-east. However, internal consumption is raising with population and the oil extraction will peak out and decline, instead of suddenly stopping after running continuously at full production. So, 2050 is the possible peak out time and oil will never recover in mid east after that. Nevertheless it is not possible to state when the technical feasibility will end. This is because the decline will be inverse function in nature approaching 0 at infinity. However, the amount of oil that can be extracted will just decrease rapidly after 2050 approaching zero as time passes. Digressing from the topic,the current oil and gas reserves for the world is enough to last 55 years at current production. If we consider the entire world oil and gas including possible but yet undiscovered shale oil and gas, the world reserves will only double (though shale oil and gas is 200% of conventional oil and gas, about 25% of them have already been discovered and included in current figures. Also, the shale requires energy intensive extraction which reduces the technical feasibility to 35\u201340%). Considering that world population will be 10 billion by 2070 and the standards of living will rise drastically especially in developing countries like India and China, the situation is going to get worse despite new discoveries. The consumption of oil is expected to double and it is likely to nullify the effect of increasing discovery. The peak oil may be slightly delayed but it will be there mostly by 2070 and even natural gas is likely to peak at the same time. By 2100, one can expect the oil to be barely extractable and almost technically unfeasible. My predictions of future : There will be islamic war across the world fueled by oil poverty and lack of food and water to feed population of 10\u201311 billion. Islam being an inherently violent religion with aggressive scripture asking for every Muslim to fight for allah (jihad), they are more likely to vent out their anger at non muslims for no reason, most probably starting with israel as that is the easiest target. Pakistan - India war is something that has to happen as that is the only logical solution and may happen. India might have 25% muslim population and a civil war could be triggered too. Civil wars between islam and others might rage in Europe too. The agriculture of today relies heavily on petrochemical fertiliser and lack of them will only exacerbate food crisis and population of the world is likely to die of starvation and a small number of people will remain using renewable and nuclear energy with limited food. That will also lead to a great era of humankind as the remaining humans will have all the technology of the previous era but with a sustainable population which can last for a long time ",

            "answer_text": "End of oil - Full disclosure: This is a canned answer built after answering this same question in slightly different wording several times. It is updated as needs be. First, last and always, the world will never run out of coal, oil or natural gas. This is not because of some unlimited supply the public is unaware of or some miraculous regeneration previously unknown to science. This is because the energy industry and the world's scientists are continually investigating new and/or improved sources of energy, improved techniques in finding and recovering hydrocarbons and improving the efficiency of all variety of devices that utilize these energy sources. The costs associated with fossil fuels will fluctuate over time just as it has since the Colonel hit that first strike in PA. Meanwhile the costs of non-fossil, renewable sources will continue to drop as technology develops to improve those sources. Eventually, in different locations around the world, at different times, those expenses will flip and future production after that will be solely for non-energy needs that will support higher prices that fuel or electrical generation. One must realize that there are many uses of oil and gas beyond energy already (Insecticides, Ink, Floor Wax, Pens, Upholstery, Clothing, Boats, Sports Car Bodies, Nail Polish, Fishing Lures, etc.) and the need for flight fuel will most likely be the longest lasting energy need. The bottom line is what does it cost to generate and how many are willing/able to pay that expense. ",

            "answer_text": "I guess it is still a secret that the US is the #1 oil producer and (arguably) has the #1 reserves and has been for a couple of years. At the current rate of consumption (8 billion barrels/year) and reserves of 250billion, we have about 30 years left of our oil. The world has roughly 70 years of oil at the current rate of consumption. Consumption will increase as the population increases and the standard of living improves, but also more oil will be found to produce. Right now, oil is quite cheap because new technology in the US made shale oil profitable in the mid-2000s. It is almost certain that if supply began to run out, prices would rise, and new technology would be applied to currently too-expensive oil deposits. Then, those new deposits would add to the supply. For example, the US technology (horizontal drilling and fracturing) could probably be applied in many other countries for oil and/or natural gas. Don\u2019t forget that there are vast untapped natural gas supplies in many areas of the world and those can be turned into oil products also, if need be. The US has 2,459 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), or about 80 years worth at the current consumption rate. It is much more likely that we will find better (cleaner, cheaper) sources of energy long before the oil and gas runs out. Next generation nuclear reactors are very promising. At the very least, widespread use of renewable energy will trim the use of oil and gas and extend the life of the known supplies. U.S. Holds Most Recoverable Oil Reserves How much natural gas is left 3 Advanced Reactor Systems to Watch by 2030 You are lucky to live in an era of such abundance. Inexpensive energy means cheaper food, water, transportation\u2026 everything really. I recommend researching the topic, The End of Scarcity. The reality is that we, the whole human race, are amazingly better off than just a few decades ago (when everyone thought we would run out of oil, and other commodities) and there is no end in sight, despite the doomsayers on the news all day and night. https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/end-scarcity Here\u2019s a whole book on the topic: Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World--and Why Things Are Better Than You Think, Hans Rosling, Anna Rosling R\u00f6nnlund, Ola Rosling - Amazon.com ",

            "answer_text": "Simplified comment on world politics in relation to oil. Opinion time. Probably a lot further away than ours will run out, which is why we keep going down there and giving them a good thumping. This has been going on, almost as soon as a use was found for the evil smelling stuff. R\ufffdsultats Google Recherche d'images correspondant \ufffd https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/World_Oil_Reserves_by_Region.PNG this data block is the interesting part for your question;-    The basic idea of going down there and giving them a thumping every second election period is to make sure that the arab states do not unify. Which is what happened when Saddam Hussein wanted to, and Gaddaffi, for example.  I can't remember which one wanted oil to be paid for in solid gold, and which one wanted for oil to be paid in euro's but it is basically why the US treasury aided by the UK and some of NATO, said, \"NOT ON MY WATCH\", because a unified arab nation would start playing with the oil prices, and Bob's your uncle, our economies would go through the floor. Exemplum;-(There have been many oil price wars, the latest having been the efforts that we all made to screw up the russian economy in order to hinder their efforts in allowing the russian part of ukraine to reunite with russia.Nato does not want this, and so a media campaign was started to tell us all that russia is bullying the ukraine, when it was the ukraine that was fed up with its own governement and said \"B*gger this for a game, let's get back together with russia.\"No one outside of russia was having any to do with that and said, \"right, down go the prices, this will screw russia.\"To which, Putin just fixed the price of vodka, and said \"We can vait\".Which is what they did.  In the meantime, someone shot down an airliner, (we all know who did it) which took our attention away from the fact that this is another part of the ongoing oil/gas war.) Back to your question, it isn't really important as to who's actual reserves dry up, but who is friendly with those who have long term reserves.You want to be friendly with the long term reserves. A geo political problem is when one of the countries runs out first.If you extrapolate that russia runs out of oil in 22 years, then some would be saying \"whoopee! we've brought russia down! Yeeha!\" The collapse of any of the superpowers for a lack of oil would cause war on a global scale.\"Don't care, 'murica's got the biggest and best fleet and the hardest marines in the world! We'll beat 'em easy.\"Yes, as we have already seen in some questions on Quora, there is no doubt that they would. With everybody else dying around it.And then Nukleaaar war.  Because a super power like russia that has collapsed would disintegrate into a dangerous state, and having nothing else to lose. So, right up until the reserves get really hairy, no one is going to help anyone, and then everyone will be sharing it out properly, just to stop the whole middle of the northern hemisphere becomming a smily sad-face. This is basically the same game that is being played with global warming and pullution.  The \"just in time\" scenario. Long after ours runs out, because they use far less than we do. They will be the ones sharing out the last reserves, and that is when you'll have the rise of the unified arab state, because everyone else will be begging. The more you bomb them now, the harder it is going to be later to have good commercial relations. If you take into account the natural gas reserves worldwide, that changes the game.  But we're talking (hypothetically) about oil reserves. ",

            "answer_text": "The first thing, first: - need to define and agree on what your term \u201crun out of oil\u201d means to you, or anybody else out there! One thing is a physical term \u201cout of oil\u201d, which simply means - (1) no more oil production, as all the oil bearing reservoirs (oil carrying rocks/sandstone/shale, \u2026) are empty of oil. Kaput, no more oil! However, there is another thing, or a state of the oil production, whereby (2) oil is ceased to be produced because there are no more buyers, as the oil price became so prohibitive expensive - nobody wants it anymore. At least, not wanted as nearly as much, as it is wanted today. Therefore, I would propose that (1) would NEVER happen, as some time in the future (20 - 30 yrs from now, or whenever) - the another scenario (2) would become the reality of life. The World and life on this Earth would be shifting to another energy sources, as the oil simply will become so expensive. The oil will be (then) produced in much smaller quantities, just for the needs (chemical industry, etc.) of those entities who can swallow the oil price of, say, $600 per barrel of oil (in today\u2019s $$$). And then, when for those reasons the oil production drops so much (say, at 10% of today\u2019s rate of prod.) - oil production could last \u201cforever\u201d. And all that goes for the Middle East oil, or any other oil producing region in the World. ",

Since it takes millions of years to get replenished, people are getting aware of that and they are now shifting to other renewable resources, such as Solar, Hydroelectric, Wind etc. But we are still relying on oil because it gives tremendous amount of energy as petorchemicals and other organic compounds have high calorific value. Now, you must know about TITAN. It is a satellite of Saturn. It has lost of oil, atleast 400 times more than what is now present in all the ARAB NATIONS! BUT ARABS ARE NOT PROFICIENT IN SPACE RESEARCH AND ECONOMY. USA too has NASA, which is powerful, and they can extract oil from there. The Arabs will have to take the US support to do that. For that they will have to pay billions of DINARS (It is the most values currency, especially the Kuwaiti Dinar). So they will again call the foreigners for the jobs. There will be more aerospace engineers than the petrochemical ones. Indians will be the first one to go there. But even ISRO will be proficient enough to develop that much technology, if India gets a right political leader in 2019 (I AM NOT A SUPPORTER OF ANY POLITICAL PARTY!) and proper administration. Then ROSCOSMOS is bracing itself to do that task and it is ready to co-operate with the world, unlike its deceased father, the Soviet Space Programme. Now the ARAB NATIONS will be playing as a puppet. CHINA CAN TOO HELP. The Arabs will not take much help form the US as it will be too expensive and they will get less profit. So they will slowly shift for the Chinese help. But by that time, we will have other technologies. The power plants will have other ways of rotating their electric generators (mechanical energy to electrical energy, where we can find many other sources of that mechanical energy to give the same amount of electrical energy.) Till then, developing countries like India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka will surge ahead. Dubai will now get completely dependent on tourism. Qatar will have its sports industry. Kuwait rely on international investors. Saudi will try to diversify their economy. They will only have to overtake NASA to become the oil masters, which is practically impossible as of today.

There's easy oil which they are still getting plenty of and then there's hard oil of which there's probably at least as much as they had of easy oil and then there's harder oil and so on. They will be able t get large molumes of oil when the price is high enough to make it worthwhile and new technology comes into play. At todays prices you just have to look up the proven reserves numbers. Oil reserves in Saudi Arabia this says there are 268 billion barrels of proven reserves in Saudi alone. WHat has been produced to date amounts to what would be 40% of the reserves. Proven Reserves means that the oil exists and is recoverable. As I pointed out there is a lot more that is there but not recoverable at todays' prices or tech. By the way their Proven reserves will last 73 years at todays pumping rates of 10 million BBl per day.  I'm pretty sure that prices will go up and technology will improve in 73 years. ",

There are variables in determining when a resource will \u2018run out\u2019 such as daily extraction, financial viability of extraction, processing costs. Something that is dirt cheap to extract and process will be used up faster than something that does not give the same profit margin. Business will then determine whether it makes economical sense to go after resources that do not give their expected profit margin and then play with production to maximize profits. Based on the profitability of the organization and the country, the Middle East may never run out of Oil and Gas as mentioned by other people. Hope this shed some light. ",

Although there are deposits that cannot be developed economically yet and are therefore not listed as \u201creserves\u201d.

Middle Eastern governments generally lie about their oil reserves, so estimates about how much is left vary a lot.
