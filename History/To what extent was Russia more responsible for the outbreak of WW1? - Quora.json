            "answer_text": "Oh - just completely, totally and entirely! But I must ask you, gentle reader, to please bear with me, as a long, seemingly unrelated, but entertaining, introduction follows. To get to the truth, we have to go to the end of the story, and work our way back. In January 1917 Prince Regent Alexander of Serbia had just spent his second Christmas in Salonika, Greece, looking back wistfully to the north, at the land he used to rule, remembering the palace feasts with prsuta, pecenica, and sarma, missing sitting on his throne, longing to sleep in his bed. Right then and there, Prince Regent Alexander got a real raw case of the a**. So, he did what any prince would do in this situation. He had the dirty, rotten so and so responsible for his exile from his beloved Belgrade arrested, tried and shot. In this case, that unlucky recipient of the prince\u2019s wrath was Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijevic, Chief of Military Intelligence for the Royal Serbian Army General Staff, who had planned the murder of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which started World War One and landed Prince Regent Alexander\u2019s tuchus in Salonika, THE party place of the Mediterranean. {the sarcasm is intended} Now Dimitrijevic was many things. Dirty, rotten, bald, jingoistic, proto-fascist, inbred, backstabbing, woman-murdering swine tops my list. But, he did face his death with a modicum of courage. At his trial, knowing his ticket was going to be punched, anyway, he started naming names, not to save himself, but to preserve his reputation and that of the unholy cause he had championed. One of the names dropped was General Viktor Artamonov, Russian Mititary Attache to Serbia. Dimitrijevic swore up and down that Artamonov had approved the assassination, and promised full Russian support, if, after the assassination succeeded, Austrian\u2019s should attack Serbia. Now everybody knew Dimitrijevic and Artamonov were buds, pals, amigos. They met almost daily to \u201cdiscuss\u201d things. Its extremely unlikely, on the face of it, that Dimitrijevic would falsely accuse Artamonov. Of course, we need to look at the evidence. The first question is would Dimitrijevic approve of the assassination attempt against Franz Ferdinand, which he did do, unless he knew he had Russian backing? Dimitrijevic was one one of the leaders of the coup that toppled the previous Serbian dynasty and put Prince Alexander\u2019s father on the throne. His life\u2019s work was dedicated to the achievement of \u201cGreater Serbia\u201d where Belgrade would rule, with an iron fist, every southern slav from Greece to Austria. He had patiently built a network of terrorist to achieve this. Also, Dimitrijevic wasn\u2019t an idiot. He knew that in a showdown, Austria Hungary would absolutely crush Serbia, without Russian intervention. It is inconceivable that he would go forward, and risk his most cherished dreams, his life\u2019s work, without getting support from Russia. Therefore, I submit that the very assassination of Franz Ferdinand was prima facea evidence that Artamonov gave Dimitrijevic the green light. But wait - there\u2019s more. Franz Ferdinand went to Bosnia, to attend the annual Austrian Hungarian army maneuvers, the week before his murder. Serbia was Russia\u2019s client state in the Balkans, the Russian\u2019s favorite thorn in the side of Austria, and Austria Hungary was, by far, the greatest threat against Serbia. So, where was General Artamonov? Well, of course, you say, in Belgrade, or on the Austrian Serbian border nearest the exercises, trying to glean every scrap of intelligence on the Austrian manpower strengths, organizations, tactics, et cetera. And you would be WRONG. Hold your nose, because this fish story is going to smell. Artamonov was conveniently on vacation. The most important week of the year for the Russian military attache to Belgrade, and he was absent from his post. That is like Santa Claus taking off the week of Christmas. One can almost hear Angela Landsbury, in the persona of the fictional detective, Jessica Fletcher, lecture Artamonov with: \u201cthat is what first roused my suspicion of you. Your alibi was too good, too convenient. You just happened to be taking a vacation when the Austrian Archduke was shot.\u201d Artamonov essentially fingered himself, by giving himself too good of an alibi. Of course the real test of Russian approval for the assassination was to follow. Austria, first politely, then insistently, requested a Serbian investigation of the crime, which clearly originated within Serbia. When that failed, Austria, along with Germany, turned to Russia, with the just request that Russia use its influence to prevail upon Serbia to investigate the crime. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sazanov, flatly, and with provocative rudeness, refused to do so. Serbia had an absolute duty under international law to investigate any crime which originated in its territory. By refusing to do so, Serbia was intentionally instigating a war with Austria Hungary, and Sazanov knew this. Why would the Tsar\u2019s government tolerate this action from its vassal state, if it did not want the war, that the Serbian refusal would certainly provoke? Is it unreasonable to suspect that if Russia was thus provoking a war in July of 1914, that it gave approval to the assassination attempt that led to the situation, the month before? Clearly, the entire affair was arranged to provoke a war. Why would either Belgrade or St. Petersburg prevent an investigation by biased, colluding police officials who would take a great deal of time to investigate the crime in a slipshod manner, and then come up with nothing, six months later, or a year, later? Can you say Warren Commission? By that time, no one would care who initiated the assassination. I grant you, the evidence of Russian pre-knowledge of the assassination is circumstantial. Strong circumstantial evidence, but circumstantial, none the less. However, whether you believe this July crisis was pre-planned, or it was a happy Fabrege Easter Egg that dropped into Sazanov\u2019s lap, Russia acted quickly to start the war. Russia coordinated with its French allies in mid July, in a state visit by the perpetually belligerent President Poincarre, and significantly, without any official records being kept. Russia had already started mobilizing before Serbia had even been presented the July 23rd demarche, by Austria. It clearly wanted the war, that it instigated, at the very, least by encouraging Serbian intransigence to Austria\u2019s demands, or, at the worst and most likely, by encouraging the Serbs to undertake Dimitrijevic\u2019s assassination plan, in the first place.

            "answer_text": "Mr. Ceccolini, thank you for asking me for an answer. I\u2019ll do my best to give a thorough reply. First, I highly recommend John Keegan\u2019s \u201cThe First World War\u201d for a superb work on this topic. He goes into great detail. To your question, I don\u2019t see any evidence that Czar Nicholas and the Romanov\u2019s were any more responsible for the outbreak of WWI than any of the other belligerents. Imperial Germany had always harbored territorial desires on Russia (a reading of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk bears this out), as had the Hapsburgs in Austria-Hungary. Imperial Russia is culpable, however, in extending military alliances through the Balkans as a way of projecting power. Czar Nicholas wanted to exploit any opportunity to get that precious warm water port the Russians have always wanted, and to extend Russia\u2019s influence westward. The assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand triggered the war as the major powers were quick to line up behind their prot\u00e9g\u00e9es (the Serbs, the Austrians, etc.), but I believe that absent Russia\u2019s alliances, the problems in the Balkans would still have festered and blown up at some point. That is, the Serbs would have found another patron had Russia not been allied with them. Hope this helps. ",
