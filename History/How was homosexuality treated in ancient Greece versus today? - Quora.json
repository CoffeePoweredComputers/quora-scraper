            "answer_text": "Aerin Crew and Raenna Foeller have both already answered this question very well! I\u2019ll try to build off what they said with what I know. I\u2019ll refrain from using words like \u201clesbian\u201d, \u201cgay\u201d, and \u201chomosexual\u201d, because they conjure up modern ideas and connotations that I believe distract us from being able to dive into a Greek mindset, which focuses on power rather than gender or preference. To summarize what Raenna said, ancient Greeks didn\u2019t think of sex in terms of genitalia but in terms of power. To be penetrated was weak/feminine/younger and to penetrate was strong/masculine/older; the words \u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u201clover\u201d and \u03b5\u03c1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u201clovee\u201d describe these ideas, as Aerin stated. As Aerin also alluded to, there was a practice among some ancient Greeks of pederasty. However, this is one of the few times that I believe Wikipedia is wrong (disclaimer - I use Wikipedia a lot and I love it; I simply disagree with it on this point, specifically its article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece, which nonetheless provides some good information): historians and classicists disagree whether pederasty was romantic, and I don\u2019t think it was. I\u2019ll explain why. - Pederasty - allow me to expand on this idea. The word \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 comes from \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 \u201cchild\u201d and \u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u201clover\u201d. Some people who either have anti-Greek or anti-queer agendas have erroneously translated this word as pedophilia. Although the components of these two words are similar, they have distinctly different connotations to the people that use them. When people say pedophilia today, they most often mean \u201csexual feelings towards children\u201d, and usually this goes beyond mere feelings to actions of sexual molestation or intercourse. Pedophilia is frowned upon whether the perpetrator is LGBTQ+ or not. Pederasty, on the other hand, was a socio-political relationship between a family and their young boy, and a man in the public sphere. Men would seek out a boy, (conversely, families could seek out men, although we have far less evidence of this) to become a mentor (lover) for the boy (lovee). These boys ranged between pre-pubescence to upper teens. This stage of seeking included courtship, wooing, and getting to know the family. The boy or his father would eventually decide which mentor he would go with. Now the lover\u2019s job was to teach the lovee how to become a man: political savviness, athletic training, music, singing, dance, and sexuality all fell under this umbrella. The lover taught the lovee how to be sexually dominant as preparation for marriage and for the lovee\u2019s own eventual pederastic relationships. We have very little evidence of anal penetration in pederasty, but our evidence does show with overwhelmingly consensus that the lovee is rarely aroused, and that the sexual portion of this relationship was for the pleasure of the lover and not for the lovee. For this reason I don\u2019t consider pederasty romantic, because I don\u2019t consider molestation romantic. To be clear, the bulk of our evidence on pederasty comes from Athens; we know of other Greek cities that looked down on pederasty and even among the Athenians there was no single opinion of it at any particular time. However, pederasty seems to be the product of a pre-scholastic educational system: acceptance of pederasty seems to be a feature of the Archaic period (~799\u2013480 BCE), and once public and even private schools became common in the Classical period (~510\u2013323 BCE) and afterwards, the public opinion of pederasty seems to have plummeted, even in Athens. - However, that says nothing about the ancient Greeks\u2019 opinion on same-genitalia intercourse, which remained relatively simple throughout the course of antiquity: You\u2019re either penetrated or you penetrate, you\u2019re either feminine or masculine. People who looked down on same-genitalia intercourse did so not because it was abominable or impure or unnatural (common accusations used in modern times), but because it upset power roles. To an ancient Greek, the problem with same-genitalia intercourse is that either a woman gets to be more-powerful/masculine (in the act of using something to penetrate someone else) or a man needs to be less-powerful/feminine (in the act of being penetrated by someone else, whether it\u2019s by a penis or a finger or some object). It would be just as upsetting for a high-class woman to be penetrated by a low-class man as for gender-roles to be switched. It ultimately boils down to power, not gender. That\u2019s the simplest truth of it, although it was of course far more complex than just that. - \u201cGay\u201d relationships - There were conservative stances, that same-genitalia sex ought to merely compliment the more normative male-female sex. There were also more progressive stances, and there\u2019s evidence of men foregoing marriage to enter into committed relationships that of course included all sorts of same-genitalia sex (unfortunately, I can\u2019t find my source for this right now, but I\u2019m positive of it!). However, this type of relationship was probably uncommon given their society; the overwhelming majority of same-genitalia relations probably happened between masters and slaves. Plato\u2019s idealization of same-genitalia love being far greater than male-female love in Sumposion is not at all representative of common thought in Athens at the time. It does provide an example of a healthy, positive \u201cgay\u201d relationship, indicating that such a relationship wasn\u2019t totally out of the question, even if it was very, very uncommon. Concerning Akhilleus and Patroklos, I doubt even the most conservative ancient Greeks would have had a problem with it being a romantic relationship. Akhilleus is one of the most powerful of the heroes, and Patroklos is both younger and less powerful. Akhilleus has a right to pursue whatever relations he wants, as long as Patroklos consents. What would be offensive to them is if someone wrote a poem about how Patroklos was always penetrating and Akhilleus was always receiving. - I hope this is a helpful summation, and please don\u2019t hesitate to post if you have further comments or counter-point on facts you think I may have gotten wrong!

            "answer_text": "It actually was a pretty funny story! Achilles and Patroclus is the best example I can give for this. They were constantly being depicted as close, but there was a disagreement between whether they were close enough to be lovers or not. Weirdly enough, the \u201cclose friends\u201d group was in the minority, and get this: There was constant argument based on who was erastes and who was eromenos, which technically the same argument as who was the protector and who was the protected in a gay relationship. \u201cPederasty in ancient Greece was a socially acknowledged romantic relationship between an adult male (the erastes) and a younger male (the eromenos) usually in his teens\u201d (from Wikipedia) They had a name for a specific gay relationship. That seems pretty accepting to me. Modern times have been pretty accepting too. Thats great for us! ",
