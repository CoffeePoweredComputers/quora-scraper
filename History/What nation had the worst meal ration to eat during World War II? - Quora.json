            "answer_text": "Well, it would come down to changing conditions. In the past, armies did not have \u2018rations\u2019 they would forage for food as they went, often pillaging towns they had taken. The US tends to have the best supplied troops. For Germany toward the end of World War II, supplies of all kinds were running very low - fuel, food, soldiers. In many ways it was the civilian population who suffered the worst deprivations. A soldier with a gun can take what he wants. When Leningrad was surrounded, the people in the city were starving. These were both civilians and soldiers. The civilians probably had a worse time of it. This was in the dead of winter. The German troops hoped to conquer the city and then eat the food left behind. Instead the city was set on fire and abandoned. When the German troops entered the city it was empty and nearly burned to the ground. Plus it was winter and it was a long walk back to Berlin. Many people died of starvation. As the Allies approached, Germans let the death camp prisoners starve. Close to death already, they cut off their food completely and many thousands died. Even when liberated and given food and medical attention, many died within a few days from how they had been treated during their last days in captivity. During World War II, my dad was in the US Navy on a battleship in the Pacific. Among other things the ship he was on provided close support for the invasion of Okinawa. He had both eardrums blown out when he was too close to one of the ships 16 inch guns when it was being fired. A Japanese plane crashed into the ship. The sailor standing next to him was killed. As far as I know the food was pretty good. My dad always tended to be chubby and that didn\u2019t noticeably change while he was in the US Navy. They were under sail for 15 continuous months, the longest of any ship in US history until that time. They were resupplied at sea. My dad had PTSD that lasted for decades. He had his own construction company and raised a family. He died at the age of 90 six years ago. His wife, my mom, lived to be 99 and died 5 months ago. They were married for 64 years. Let us not forget those who served their countries so we can enjoy the freedom we have today. Many sacrifices were made. Many lives lost. John McCain said he appreciates being able to drink a glass of water with ice in it. We take a lot of things for granted. There were many people who died from not having the basics to sustain life, a piece of bread, a glass of milk. ",

            "answer_text": "As both Indo China and \u2018India\u2019 (Bengal, actually) had regional famines which killed so many during the war, I\u2019d go with them. Famines killed people in Greece, Holland and other regions as well, but at far lower levels. After that, it\u2019d be absurd to consider shortages worse than famines. A few interesting stories regarding WWII Rations. The UK did a tremendous amount of actual waste, during their rationing, with many animals culled yet the valuable meat not used, because the feed was diverted to human consumption and distribution problems existed. Many people died of starvation and related conditions, AFTER the war, often in places we\u2019d not expect, like Western Europe. Tens of thousands of Japanese civilians, brought into occupied places in China and other countries to create and support Japanese infrastructure and build farms and businesses were essentially abandoned by a Japanese government unable to evacuate them, while some were killed by the Chinese out of revenge, many more simply starved to death as the Chinese were scraping by and had nothing for undesired former enemies. Quirks also existed, for example, in the UK, there might be a loosing on restrictions of fish, but the oil shortage still existed, and so many did not know how to cook white meat fish without oil, so the ration might not be fully exploited. People in the UK, according to the spin, were healthier during the rationing which is hard to believe as they were short on milk and good lipids. The rationing lasted long after the war. Ignored, and a seldom admitted reality, black marketing did provide a release valve for some. Sometimes people simply NEEDED more and were willing to pay, and it was available, but the governments did not turn a blind eye to this necessity. Rationing is a peculiar, in direct thing, with food and other items. For example, the US never really had a shortage with petro chemicals, however, the problem was transportation. Much of the fuel distribution was done along the Atlantic seaboard and picking off tankers along the coast was easy work for German U Boats, and you\u2019d have oil destroying key oyster beds and shoreline so a reduction of in personal use meant the ships being used were more essential and tied to the war effort. Rationing gas was to save tires and parts more than anything concerns about saving gas for the military. So, to parallel that, a food item might be ration limiting a food item might be do to the it\u2019s production or harvest being too labor, fuel, or fertilizer intensive. They had formulas to work this weird alchemy of ration board decisions that often seemed confusing. In contrast to Europe, my Father as a child during the War in the US remembers no food shortages, even with rationing as although his parents were both working in War Industries, they\u2019d maintained some of their farming/rural habits and had access to primarily chicken, poultry, and pork, were still getting beef, and his father, who had a taste for oysters, now had more money to buy them, and with his brothers at war, there was more food on the table for those left. In fact, there might be someone selling burgers during a fair and they waived off the ration coupons or \u2018forgot\u2019 to take them. This was during the beginning and the end of rationing, but in some places, it was absurd to consider beef rationing. One funny story, an old timer told me that during the War, his carnival would sell \u2018buttered\u2019 popcorn the last day and they sold incredible amounts as butter was rationed and actually difficult to get in urban areas. What they were using was freely available MINERAL oil with butter salt, and to palates only remembering buttered popcorn it tasted close enough, and by the time people got the inevitable trots, the carnival was out of town, they figured the carny food got them, which it did, and by next year they forgot the \u2018buttered\u2019 popcorn is what got them the runs. Makes one wonder how many people that carnival killed. On paper, the military rations of each country, all components available and consumed as ordered, were, if not adequate to meet the needs of their soldiers, but very few countries could meet the needs production wise, much less distribution wise. The US tended to improperly issuing rations, of which there were many types, and kept giving short term rations to troops which were inadequate for needs, but they provided them in great quantities. The Japanese had a serious problem was there was an assumption that they would forage for certain items, like fresh greens, or alternatively, be able to purchase supplements at their canteens like pickled vegetables and some of the tinned seafood products. That may work well for a conquering army, living partially off the land, and using captured enemy or civilian food stocks, but the fate of say 16,000 soldiers in garrison on a small, soon to be barren island, with only the direct rations coming in was grim, and meant slow starvation. Back then, for most countries, some form of soup, or stew, cooked in the field and some form of starch was the ration for the military. For many European soldiers, especially in the East, it might be reduced to some cabbage soup, and some coarse bread or potatoes with an occasional bit of sausage, often largely starch. In Asia, it was obviously rice, but often millet, some limited beans, some veggies, often pickled, and tinned or fresh fish. Very similar to the actual individual rations. For the actual military rations, for most countries that included a small tin of some meat product, often fish, packets of some form of hard bread, hard cracker, not up to the level of being hardtack, but a form of carbo, some dextrose, and maybe a proper candy, and a few cigarettes, day after day. Some countries had, and still do, some wine or liquor, Most of it was tinned. The Americans had a chocolate bar that wasn\u2019t the flavor that comes to mind when thinking chocolate as they didn\u2019t want to make it too good, as it\u2019d be eaten like candy, literally, the Brits had a neat oatmeal tin with all the components, dry, in separate bags.
