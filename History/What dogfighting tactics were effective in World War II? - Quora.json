            "answer_text": "Many good references in other answers to the \u2018boom and zoom\u2019 or diving and slashing attack and a good mention of the excellent defensive Thach Weave, but the RAF made its best tactical change as a result of experience gained during the Battles of France and Britain. They changed their standard tactic from a tight three-ship formation or \u2018Vic\u2019 to the \u2018finger four\u2019, copied from the German four-ship \u2018schwarm\u2019. The Vic involved a section of three planes, one leader and two wingmen, formed up almost wingtip to wingtip in a \u2018v\u2019 with the leader at the apex and the two wingmen echeloned behind him on each side. The wingmen\u2019s job was to stay in formation and follow their leader. The leader\u2019s job was to look out for the enemy and then lead his section in to attack. The three-ship Vic would then attack the target with the concentrated fire of twenty-four machine-guns. The big problem was that the wingmen were entirely occupied with keeping station. They had no leeway to manoeuvre and little opportunity to keep a look-out for the enemy other than in their mirror. The section leader was thus the sole look-out and he had to scan the skies ahead for targets as well as look around on the flanks for bandits. In practice this was too much work. If the enemy fighters came in from the quarters or above & behind, the likelihood was that nobody in the section would know about it until tracer was streaking past the aircraft. Far too late, then they had to \u201cBreak!\u201d and it was all just a mess. The new four-ship formation looked superficially like a Vic with one extra plane on one side of the formation. But it was formed differently of two sections, each composed of a leader and wingman, and it flew in a much looser order. The \u2018lead\u2019 section (leader and his single wingman)controlled the formation\u2019s course and target selection, while the echeloned \u2018trailing\u2019 section flew in formation with the lead plane on the other side of the flight leader\u2019s plane to his wingman. In battle, the Leader\u2019s section was able to look for and attack enemy targets, while the trailing section was able to concentrate on covering their fellows\u2019 tails. Not having to keep such close station as in the Vic gave the pilots the freedom to concentrate on this. Further, the wingman in each section had the freedom to move relative to his section leader and thus provide much better cover in case a bandit latched onto them. The finger-four made RAF fighter squadrons much more flexible & effective in battle by improving awareness and pilot survival likelihood. As already stated, the Germans had already adopted this tactic by the time of the Battle of France (they may have been flying it with Bf 109s at the very least ever since Poland, but I am not 100% certain of this) and virtually every air force adopted it, with the possible exception of the Japanese, who I believe were users of three-ship formations (with variation) for most of the war.

            "answer_text": "Thatch weave. First used in the Pacific theatre dogfights,the Thatch weave was one of the most ingenious,audacious and perilious tactics ever used in history of air warfare.. The skies over the Pacific ocean in first six months of the war were completely dominated by the Japanese \u201cA6M zero \u201cfighters shooting down the outclassed U.S fighters in scores,enabling the \u201cNihon Rikugun\u201d(Japanese army) to rapidly conquer most of the south east Asia, and extending the \u201cNihon Kaigun\u2019s(Japanese Navy) influence till mid-Pacific. Extremely manuverable,fast and having an exceptionally long range,the Japanese Zero ,very soon earned a fearsome reputation.. Originally concieved and executed by John Thatch and his comrade Butch o\u2019Hare,the tactic was mostly performed on F4F Wildcat fighters owing to their heavy armor and relatively superior fire power.  It required 2 aircraft flying parallel to each other keeping a distance of about 60 meters from each other.  One of them acted as a bait trying to lure an enemy aircraft towards itself.  As the enemy plane engages by firing its guns..  ..\u2026.the allied planes turn inwards towards themselves bringing the enemy plane within the range of the wingmans guns\u2026and boom!!..Checkmate!! Now U.S Wildcats had a very good armor ,could sustain several bullet hits and still remian flying worthy and continue in the battle while the Japanese zeros lacked self sealing fuel tanks and would immediately turn into a ball of fire on being hit by even a short burst of fire.. Since the planes cross each other,it resembles a weaving movement and hence called a weave The tactic being ideal in such situations ,was used extensively throughout the war until the U.S developed Coraisars and Hellcats which outmatched the Zero\u2019s. The tides of the war,turned against the Japanese at Midway,where thatch weave maneuver was conducted for the first time. Cheers! ",
