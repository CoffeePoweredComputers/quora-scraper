            "answer_text": "The answer to this question requires one to specify what period in particular we are talking about because the relative power of the Pharaoh compared to the priesthood(s) within Egypt varied over time.   Broadly speaking, it is thought that in the earlier dynasties of the Old Kingdom (3-4 dynasties or roughly 2615 to 2490 B.C.) that the power of the Pharaoh as compared to anyone else reachedits height.  This is what explains how the grandest and most famous creations of Ancient Egypt -- the large stone pyramids of Giza, Dahshur and Saqqara -- came during the first of three \"golden ages\" rather than during the last as one might otherwise assume.   Basically, the argument is that at this earlier date before the full development of Egypt's aristocracy and priesthood the Pharaoh held almost all the power, thus giving him the clout to devote the lion's share of his country's resources to personal projects such as his tomb.  However, after the peak during Khufu's reign and his \"Great\" Pyramid there was a steady decline in the size of pyramids and eventually their quality as well.  For instance, the pyramids of the later Old Kingdom dynasties and those of the Middle Kingdom were far smaller and often just a covering of smooth limestone over jumbles of stone or even mere mud brick -- once the casing stones were stolen away at a later time all that was left was a mound of rubble.   At the same time one can trace greater resources being directly into a wider range of projects, religious buildings, and the personal tombs of lesser individuals, a sure sign that power was being dispersed away from the Pharaoh and into the hands of a larger class of elites.  Without a doubt the largest single group would have been the growing priesthoods of the various gods, which over time became fixed parts of the establishment with what amounted to hereditary rights to vast amounts of land and resources.   As the dynasties came and went the balance of power between Pharaoh and the priesthood seesawed according to the events of the times and the personal skill and charisma of the ruler.  In times of strife and discord local priesthoods became the de facto masters of their surrounding territory, able to make and break would be monarchs, not to mention play with what was lawful.  For instance, one compelling theory of how the majority of the burial goods in the Valley of the Kings were plundered is that when central authority broke down during the first centuries of the Third Intermediate Period the priests of Amun who by then effectively ruled the area took the opportunity to fill their coffers by draining those of the long dead Pharaohs (all the while justifying it as supposedly taking precautions against the Pharaoh's mummies being desecrated). A famous counter example was when the Pharaoh Akhenaten tried (among other things) to break the power of the priesthood of Amun by moving his court to a brand new city and establishing the quasi-monotheistic worship of a single divinity, namely the Aten.  This new religious structure placed the Pharaoh in a more central position than before while marginalizing much of the old clergy.  In fact, Akhenaten went as far as attempting to stamp out the old religion completely, although he didn't get far.  Still, the fact that he could take a real swing at rewriting centuries of religious dogma illustrates how powerful Pharaohs had become by then.  Nevertheless, once he died the old structures and interest groups reasserted themselves almost immediately.  And, yes, the Pharaoh was also, in general, the de jure high priest, but in the practical everyday sense others filled that duty since the ruler had other things on his plate than only making the gods happy -- and the priests wanted to protect their positions.  Thus, in the larger sense there was always a tug-of-war between the Pharaoh and the established priesthood over who had the greater overall power even if the two overlapped and at times were willing allies.

            "answer_text": "I find Alan Hoch's description quite accurate after reading extensively on the subject. However i can not full agree with the conclusion. Now the sovereign was indeed largely recognized as a son of Re, but also had the claim to be the god Horus. Now because of this fact he had 2 functions. The first function was administrative work and the second function was religious. By religious i mean that it was the pharaoh's duty to maintain and uphold the country, as it was created out of the primordial waters. This religious and administrative double-function was so extensive that the sovereign had to get priests to exercise this function, or at least most of this function for him. Now from these simple facts, i would conclude that the sovereign, even though having less overall power, would still be THE most powerful, because he had the power to replace every priest he wished to, with another person, priest or not. This fact enables him to place a trusted person, in each powerful post, which indeed the sovereign is known to have done. Thereby he had the central power, and the power to regulate every other powerful factor in his kingdom. In the end i would also point out that to a large extend is a subjective matter. It is not know for a fact, which had the most power, all we can do is analyze the subject and see if we find the same conclusion. ",
