            "answer_text": "Austria was for a time a major world power: the Austrian Archduke Charles v was Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire; King of Spain and Lord of the Netherlands, as titular Duke of Burgundy, but he ceded the Austrian lands to his brother Ferdinand I in 1521, by 1526 Ferdinand I had also inherited the Kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary which paved the way for the later formation of the Austro- Hungarian Empire. However Austria found itself locked in a power struggle between the ruling Habsburg dynasty and opposing forces from France: Sweden and the Protestant German States who worked together to ensure that Habsburg influence was contained to Austria, Hungary and Bohemia. Nevertheless, when the neighbouring Ottoman Empire, launched a second attempt to seize Vienna in 1683; the Austrians won the day and eventually succeeded in pushing the Turks back beyond Belgrade in 1699. This success was followed by further success in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701\u20131714) which was a struggle between the Austrian Habsburgs and King Louis xiv of France. The Austrians again won the day and the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) gave them control of the Spanish Netherlands; Naples and Lombardy. Austrian power reached its zenith at this time and its territories reached their greatest extent thanks to further successes in the Balkans. When Charles vi died (in 1740) and was succeeded by his daughter Maria Theresa, Austria was perceived to be weak and this led to the War of the Austrian Succession (1740\u201348 ) shortly followed by the Seven Years War (1756\u20131763) consequently Austria lost Silesia to Prussia. The Napoleonic Wars (1803\u201315) resulted in Austria losing further territory. The Congress of Vienna resulted in Austria becoming part of the German Confederation until the Austro-Prussian war of 1866, which resulted in Austria being defeated by Prussia and expelled from the German Confederation. Austria also lost some of its Tyrolean territories to the newly formed Italian State and so it became a shadow of its former Imperial self, with the declaration of a dual monarchy of Austro-Hungary under the Austro-Hungarian compromise of 1867. Then the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne (the Archduke Franz Ferdinand) at Sarajevo in 1914, saw Austro-Hungary and her allies plunged into the Great War of 1914\u20131918. The losses of the war saw an end to Austro-Hungary and the Habsburg dynasty. ",

            "answer_text": "Adding to the other Answers, it must be said that \u201cAustria\u201d, before 1918, was an Empire, made up of many ethnicities, some of them antagonistic with others within the Empire and most of them strongly disliking the Austrian (German) dominance. The Empire was so diverse that official records in civil administration were kept in German, Hungarian, Polish, Czech, or Russian. In the Austrian-Hungarian Army of 1918, there were no less than 14 different official languages (Croatian, Czech, German, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Romanian, Ruthenian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, Ukrainian and Turkish). There was also four different alphabets (Roman, Cyrillic, Arabic and Hebrew). Some of these ethnicities were kept as part of the Empire by force, as was the case of the Polish and Czech, to the point that many soldiers from these regions deserted from the Austrian-Hungarian Army to join their enemies in World War I. Even before the fighting ended in Europe, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire fell apart - the Armistice with Italy was signed in November, 3rd, 1918. However, \u201con October 17, 1918, the Hungarian Parliament terminated the union with Austria and declared the independence of the country, Czechoslovakia was formed on October 28, followed by the emergence of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs on October 29 [Yugoslavia]. On November 3, the West Ukrainian People's Republic declared independence; on November 6, Poland was re-established in Krakow. Also during the collapse of the empire, the Republic of Tarnobrzeg, the Hutsul Republic, the Lemko Republic, the Komancza Republic, the Republic of Prekmurje, the Hungarian Soviet Republic, the Slovak Soviet Republic, the Banat Republic and the Italian Regency of Carnaro arose\u201d. Dissolution of Austria-Hungary - Wikipedia. So \u201cAustria\u201d today, is only a small fraction of the Austrian (and later on, Austrian-Hungarian) Empire, it can not have the same influence it once held.  Post war borders and ethnic map. ",
