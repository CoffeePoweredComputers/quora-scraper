            "answer_text": "Whether becoming a trader is \u201cworth it\u201d depends on what your goals are. In the beginning, most new traders are underfunded to reach their profit goals. So, it could time some time to reach the point where you are making money that matters to you. Having said that, I believe EVERYONE should work to become a trader. (I focus on trading the Forex market). I\u2019m not saying become a trader as a profession. But I think everyone should trade part-time independently as a business. It is becoming increasingly difficult to save enough money for retirement. Therefore, start a part-time trading business is an excellent idea. This will allow you to create an income stream you can benefit from well after your retirement years are upon you. Think of it as starting a business that takes 10 minutes a day to run and producing income for life\u2026 instead of living off only the money you saved during your \u201cworking years\u201d. In this scenario, becoming a trader is definitely \u201cworth it\u201d. Securing your financial future is always worth it in my opinion.

            "answer_text": "Depends on how you define \u201cWorth it.\u201d Are you guaranteed to make millions? Of course not. Becoming a successful day trader requires a lot of hard work. There will be failures and it will take time to become consistently profitable. That said, most day traders who stick with it love the challenge and couldn\u2019t picture doing anything else. Start looking at some free courses and videos on YouTube and then try paper trading. See if you have an interest in it. The only way you will is if you actually enjoy it. ",
