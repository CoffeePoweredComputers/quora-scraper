            "answer_text": "This is very much a leading question. While there\u2019s no doubt Henry felt betrayed by Richard, Henry felt betrayed by a whole lot of people for most of his adult life, including his wife and most of his children. But the reason for that is that Henry picked a lot of fights with other people, mainly because he was very, very, very grabby with other people\u2019s stuff. Especially his wife (whom he \u201cstole\u201d from another king). And his wife\u2019s realm. To which he had no legal right. At all. So, who betrayed whom is pretty open to question. The thing is that Richard and Henry didn\u2019t fall out over England. They fell out over Aquitaine. Aquitaine belonged to Richard\u2019s mother, Eleanor, who was the most powerful queen in all but name in Western Europe at that time. Aquitaine was huge and strong and very different in culture from points north of it. It was bigger than either France (which was not the country it is today) or England (ditto). And nobles all over the area coveted it the way Gollum coveted his Preciousss in Lord of the Rings. Only Eleanor\u2019s children, never her husband, would inherit Aquitaine. Her father, on his deathbed, made the King of France her guardian, figuring he was one of the few nobles strong enough to protect her and her realm from rapacious other nobles looking to kidnap her and take her lands from her by force. The King promptly married her to his own son, then dropped dead. This arrangement sorta, kinda worked, for a while. The Aquitainian people apparently loved Eleanor (at any rate, she was able to keep their favor beyond two husbands, long enough to leave the realm to one of her sons). They liked Louis, at least at first, and didn\u2019t initially mind the plan of Louis doing the fairly common thing of a King Consort administering his wife\u2019s lands in her name. But alas, Eleanor and Louis were not at all suited to each other. We should take with a large chunk of rocksalt the stories that circulated about Eleanor\u2019s alleged sexual exploits. Such stories were rather commonly spouted about strong-willed, capable Queens, especially if they were Ruling Queens rather than Consorts or Regents. It wasn\u2019t just about Louis being rather boring and pious. He was also weak and passive-aggressive. So, 15 years, a crusade, and two daughters later, he thought it perfectly acceptable to mouth off to and about his wife per the lack of male heirs to that point, and think she\u2019d just sit there and take it. Ha. It\u2019s rather complicated and not really relevant how Eleanor and Henry got together. Let\u2019s just say she was already in the process of getting a divorce\u2014\u2019scuse me, an annulment, which was the 12th century noble\u2019s version of a divorce\u2014when she met Henry and therefore, bigamy was never an issue. But with her being the equivalent of a Queen Regnant of Aquitaine, that wouldn\u2019t have affected her possession of it, anyway. She could have banged every noble in Aquitaine (much like Urraca I of Castile-Leon during and after divorcing her second husband) and still have remained its undisputed Duchess. Naturally, due to the terms of her inheritance of the realm, Aquitaine went with Eleanor into her new marriage. And thus, a new rivalry between realms was born as that loss really chapped Louis\u2019 monkish buttcheeks a lot more than the loss of Eleanor or the lack of male heirs (he remarried and got a son, anyway). Henry was a clever and much more active ruler than Louis. But like Louis, he was blinded by his own chauvinism into thinking he could somehow snake his wife\u2019s realm out from under her and she\u2019d just let him. A woman who\u2019d ridden on crusade to the Holy Land and back, in armor, and whose people loved her (him rather less, and even less as the years passed). Ha. You would have thought he\u2019d have known better, since he inherited England through his mother, who had fought a civil war to keep that throne. But there you go. The dazzling power of High Medieval sexism. Henry\u2019s chosen method of pulling off this con was to try to hand Aquitaine off to whichever son he loved the most (they did have five) at any given time. He liked to change up his favorites a lot and keep his children at each other\u2019s throats. He seemed to believe this would keep them from rebelling against him effectively and overthrowing him in his lifetime. The actual effect was rather the opposite. By the way, lose any ideas that The Lion in Winter was historically accurate. The Angevins weren\u2019t even within shouting distance of winning the most dysfunctional medieval family award, even of that period. Look up Enguerrand de Coucy and his son Thomas, sometime. Yeesh. Henry and Eleanor appear to have married, at least in part, out of passionate love (a rarity for that class and time). And even if that fever, hotter than a pepper sprout, eventually died, Eleanor was relatively tolerant of Henry\u2019s standard, 12th century male noble peccadillos with other women until he decided to become besotted by the rather boring and passive Rosamund. It was when he started acting as though Aquitaine was his to dispose of in his dynastic Hunger Games that she lost her patience with him. See, early in their marriage, while she was still bearing sons, Eleanor had picked the second oldest surviving boy, Richard, as her designated heir in Aquitaine. She took him out to see the nobles of Aquitaine, did the glad-handing rounds, and made it pretty clear Richard was going to succeed her. Henry tolerated this, but again, he had to get grabby. He kept \u201cgiving\u201d Aquitaine to various other sons, even taking it from Richard after Richard had subdued a rebellion and been ruling it for a while. This was problematical for Eleanor, Richard and even Aquitaine, so she got her sons to rebel against their father (not that hard, really) and got locked up for nearly two decades as a result. But she had the last laugh. She outlived Henry, gave Aquitaine to Richard (though he didn\u2019t live long enough to produce a son), and was fortunate not to live long enough to see her youngest child, the doltish John (who was probably Henry\u2019s favorite!), lose it to her stepson, Philip. So, long story short, no, Richard didn\u2019t betray Henry. Henry betrayed Eleanor and Richard, and the rest of the family, on a pretty regular basis. And when he ended up ground under the wheel of his own making in the end, he complained he\u2019d been the one betrayed. ",

            "answer_text": "The problems Henry II faced were largely consequences of his own obsession for control over every bit of his Kingdom. He would take away nobles lands and property and then return them, simply to convey the message to the nobility that the reason they have their lands and property is because HE allowed them to keep them. He would intimidate the church into naming Thomas Becket, his personal advisor and friend, as Archbishop of Canterbury. This was so he could control the Church, which always remained out of his grip, through Becket. He got angry at Becket, who upon becoming Archbishop of Canterbury, defied his orders to bring the Church to heel. He went against tradition of having the Archbishop of Canterbury anoint a king, by getting other bishops to crown his son, known as, Henry, the Young King as King of England. Becket responded by excommunicating the bishops who took part in the ceremony, when Henry makes an angry rant about Becket, some of his knights interpret it as an order to kill Becket. After Becket is murdered, his priests who watched it happen spread the word across Europe, and Henry's reputation across Europe is significantly damaged. To add to Henry's problems, he was suppose to provide a degree of autonomous power to Henry the Young King, but Henry II's obsession with control means he doesn't. This caused Henry, the Young King to become resentful of his father, and Richard knew if his brother wasn't getting any power, he wouldn't either. As for Henry II's wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, she became angry with Henry after finding out that not only did his men control her Aquitaine, but he sold part of it off. At one point, Henry II was facing his 2 sons, his wife, the King of France and the King of Scotland, who Henry the King Young King said would be allowed to annex a part of England, in return for support against Henry II. Henry II was under immense pressure from all sides, then he did something unusual. He knew events got worse for him following the events of Becket's death, so he went to Becket tomb and allowed the priests who witnessed Becket's murder to whip him several times each, seemingly as an act of repentance. Through sheer miraculous luck, which at the time must of felt like an act of god to Henry II, the King of Scotland had been caught which stopped the fight with Scotland. Eventually he was able to turn the whole thing round to point his sons had to come back and ask for forgiveness. Unfortunately, Henry never learned from his mistakes and his obsessive desire to control continued. ",
