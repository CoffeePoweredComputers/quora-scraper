            "answer_text": "I'm not an expert on ancient history, but I think the earliest documented historical event for which historians agree on a date is the battle of Kadesh, between Egyptians and Hittites. It is usually dated in 1274 b.C, even though few historians suggest alternative dates, such as 1275 b.C., or even 1286 b.C. The battle is well attested both by Egyptian and Hittite documents; the real problem is that we don't really know who won and who lost! ",
