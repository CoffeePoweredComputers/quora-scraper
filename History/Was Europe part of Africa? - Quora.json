            "answer_text": "Unlikely. The theory of plate tectonics seems to be fully accepted now. It divides the Earth's crust into a number of irregularly-shaped pieces interlocking together like a badly designed jigsaw. These plates can shrink and expand and move in relation to each other. Where the plate boundaries meet they can be sliding around rubbing against each other, moving apart, or moving towards each other. This all happens very slowly over millennia. Science is reasonably sure now where the plate boundaries are. One runs across the Mediterranean from the Straits of Gibraltar to the Aegean then down through Suez to the Gulf, skirts across the top of India, around Java and up the East China coast. Africa is on the south plate and Eurasia is on the north plate. You can tell more or less where the boundary is because it's marked by a string of mountains where the meeting plates have buckled upwards. From https://geology.com/plate-tectonics.sbtml ",

            "answer_text": "Truth be told, borders between Africa and Europe have been changed or redefined many times in world history. Hence, a number of sayings and expressions as follows : Africa starts in Rome ;Africa begins at the Pyrenees ;Africa begins south of the Ebro river ;Southern Italy equals Africa.Below is a passage on Western Europe, anciently called Africa. Full text of \"Asiatic Researches- Vol-viii Th\" WESTERN EUROPE, ANCIENTLY CALLED AFRICA. Major Wilford's investigations led him to remark, in the 8th volume of the \" Asiatic Researches,\" that \" it is well known to the learned that, at a very remote period, Europe and Africa were considered as but one of two grand divisions of the world, and that The appellation Africa was even extended to the western parts of Europe, all along the shores of the Atlantic.
