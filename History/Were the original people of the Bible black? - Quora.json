            "answer_text": "NO. Despite the insistent resurgence of pro-African studies, there have always been a multitude of races and colors. I realize that this goes against political correctness (a philosophy to which I do not subscribe), and the need for some people to make everyone black in the Bible, and believe it or not, I have read and discussed this matter at length with a number of persons of this persuasion. Since I am the only \u201cwhite\u201d member of my church, this subject has come up, as a matter of a fact. Once my views were explained, most people (many of whom are not just African-American, but African, as in from AFRICA, or Haiti or Jamaica) agreed with me. Now that we have DNA, these things are becoming more and more clear, and all the old books that tried to \u201cprove\u201d that the Hebrews, and especially Yahshua (Jesus) was THEIR race have to re-write a lot of things. Everyone wanted Yahshua (Jesus) to be their race, and missed the whole point of His teachings. completely. I\u2019ve read white supremacist literature, black supremacist literature, and even Asian supremacist literature, along with a few other things promoting other races. Most of them want the honor of saying that Yahshua was among THEIR people, along with the whole Hebrew race. The point of His message is not to make Him like one of them, but make them, regardless of their race, more like HIM. I had my DNA done. I know exactly where I came from. I know that part of my heritage goes back through Palestine and the Levant, Egypt, and Israel, and I am not black. Neither are any of my recently known ancestors. Farther back? Yes. I have not only Egypt but Ethiopia and Morocco in there, somewhere. Here\u2019s an interesting little thought. This is attacked by the politically-correct people, but it is still not disputed. The Bible calls a few of the Hebrews \u201cruddy\u201d, and that does NOT mean \u201cblack\u201d or even dark brown. In fact, in one place, it specifically says \u201cwhite\u201d. (Song of Solomon 5:10) Now we know that this is not \u201cwhite\u201d like snow but in reference to relative whiteness. Song of solomon described not an inter-racial romance but an inter-class romance between two people of the Bible. One was dark - because of the sun. It\u2019s called a TAN. They were of the lower classes and had to work in the sun and get dark. It is very specific about that (Song of Solomon 1:6). The man was of the higher classes, didn\u2019t have to work outside, thus did not get tanned, and could be described as white and ruddy (rosy colored). This, as I have said, is not some pro-white stuff - I\u2019ve read a bunch of it and it goes far off the mark on this. This is simply what the Bible says. People have always mixed together, which is why Hebrew DNA can be found in Africa - and Europe, and Asia as well. When the Bible says that the Israelites would be \u201cscattered\u201d, by God it was right. What specific color they were \u201coriginally\u201d, I can\u2019t say. ",

            "answer_text": "The fact that you use the term \u201cblack\u201d to refer to a huge group of people of a broad range of morphologies shows just how rooted in Eurocentric brain washing your thinking has been. Understanding this concept is your first step in enlightenment towards your question\u2019s answer. The Bible details stories of many groups of people. The first obviously being the original man and woman. They were created in the \u201cGarden of Eden\u201d which would be located down a river that is fed by 4 rivers, according to those scriptures. Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground\u2014trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah(Somalia or western Saudi Arabia), where there is gold. (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin[a] and onyx are also there.) The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush(Ethiopia/Nubia). The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. This could indicate a now submerged land somewhere where the Gulf of Eden broadens into the Indian Ocean. The people in that region are more darker skinned with curly/wavy black hair, brown eyes, fuller lips and broad noses. Some refer to their type as \u201cHamitic\u201d.        Evolutionists believe that the first humans came from this general area which is a part of the Great Rift Valley. Again this points to similar morphological features. It therefore is very reasonable and logical to consider if not believe that the \u201coriginal people\u201d of the Bible were in fact dark skinned if by original you refer to the first or earliest. The Bible goes through various time frames and territories with migration changes. People changed as did morphological features of characters. Most of the Biblical characters were \u201cSemitic\u201d in features which also incorporates a wide range of morphologies. I merely use terms like Hametic and Semitic because of this discussion hinging on Biblical ideology. I would not do so normally although I find the terms more useful than often used terms such as \u201cNegroid\u201d /\u201cCaucasiod\u201d/Mongoloid\u201d yet equally rooted in pseudo science.      Somewhere in that spectrum. On this, surprisingly science and the Biblical story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden seem to somewhat concur. ",
