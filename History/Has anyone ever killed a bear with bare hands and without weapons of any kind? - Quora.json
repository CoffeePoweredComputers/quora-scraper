The grizzly fainted and he finished it off with a stick by striking repeatedly at the head. That's one of the 2 stories. The other was seen a man and a grizzly bear in the pit, deep in the woods that both were killed. No body knows what happen but that bear was killed by bare hands as well. Movie film \u201dThe Revenant\u201d was inspired by that story and novel. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think it is possible but I\u2019ve heard this story of a mighty Indian wrestler who had confronted a bear, (probably an Indian sloth bear, not grizzly) with his bare hands by putting his hands intothroat until the bear retreated and ran for its life. The story says that the wrestler survived with a few teeth missing and some minor maul injuries. It is just a story anyway but if you consider the size and physique of both man and bear (doesn\u2019t matter which kind) the probability of an unarmed man getting away alive is close to null, let alone killing the bear.

It wasn't an impossible task as these were eastern and southeastern bears which are a lot smaller than western black bears or grizzlies. This happened quite a few times. A lot of these stories are pro ably hyped up, but I know of one man in Jackson Hole, Wyoming,a hunter and guide killed a bear by choking and biting. And it wasn't an eastern bear. ",
