            "answer_text": "Because, starting in the early XVII century, we entered something called the Age of Enlightenment. The era's philosophy is perfectly encapsulated by this wikipedia quote:   The most important idea of the Enlightenment was the belief in people's reason, that all people can think for themselves. Therefore, a person should not automatically believe in what an authority claims.   Hence, people started using scientific reasoning to learn how the world works. We no longer had to believe as a hard fact that the Earth was founded by God 6000 years ago and, if it was, we could find proof for ourselves.
