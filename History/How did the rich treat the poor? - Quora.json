Like in \u201chow ugly is that street market where people buy and sell local fruits, it ruins my view\u201d - and the market is important for local people who are poorer. In this cases, the rich don\u2019t care, and any virtual encounter is to be prevented by security people or law enforcement people, seen as being there to protect the rich. (less developed countries, corrupt statesand so on) More \u201ccivilised\u201d rich people flock towards exclusively rich areas, from which they elegantly care about the poor via charity, donations and other philantrophical methods, but without troubling themselves really with all the inequities and unfairness in the world. As an exception, some (perhaps who have known both poverty and richness) understand (to some limits) what it means being one or another. Some get personally involved in charity work. They care in a different way because they feel the huge gap is a premise for an abyss, and having such a thing at the basis of any society cannot forecast good things. ",

            "answer_text": "Generally, rich people don\u2019t suddenly become \u201csuper good\u201d or \u201csuper evil\u201d when they get a lot of money, or even if they\u2019re born into it. If a rich person is raised to be a miserly, greedy bastard, it is likely they will continue to be one when they get a lot of money. Or if they were once the sort of person who wished they could help people but couldn\u2019t because they needed to take care of themselves first, it is likely they will help a lot of people when they get money. For the most part, rich people want other people to have money. The less poor people are, the more stuff they buy! Aside from that, anything that doesn\u2019t make them not-rich is mostly okay. ",

For the most part being rich tends to afford the luxury of not thinking too excessively about it. Dear poor if you want the rich to give you money at least make the effort to kiss up to them, that should not be asking too much. ",

Only those that are Democrats are obsessed with classifying people into more categories now than I will bother to post. Democrats care only about those loyal to THE PARTY and pretend to care in order to get votes. The experience for many years has been that caring has produced zero and actually, caring never will. Never has their been a more pretentious bunch of people than the Democratic Party Leadership. Those that follow them either have been miseducated into thinking they will do something rational because they care or profit from saying they care. (Oscars, Grammys anyone?). ",
