            "answer_text": "Were ancient armies truly bigger than Medieval ones? Not only Romans, even barbaric tribes seemed to field with ease tens of thousands, which was a rarity in the Middle Ages. Giving the number of soldiers in the thousands, while useful for giving some indication of military strength, is not strictly speaking indicative of how militarised a society is nor how good the soldiers are. A state that can field a hundred cataphracts, knights or cuirassiers is certainly fielding more military potential than a state that fields two hundred unarmoured soldiers with spears and shields. In relative terms a group of 100 people that field 50 soldiers has a bigger army than a group of 200 people who field 60 soldiers and a group of 50 who field 100 soldiers is cheating! This answer is going to include a lot of numbers and it is important to keep in mind most of them are estimates. This answer might also be helpful for those trying to create somewhat plausible fantasy armies in their books or tabletop games.  The United States census of 1860 shows the states that joined the Confederacy had a population of around 9,103,332 people. Of these some 5,582,222 were free men and women.  Above: A map of the Confederacy during the US civil war For ease of calculation we could say that all free people where white (even though there were free people of colour) and that roughly half of these were men (despite gender ratios generally being in favour of women), but lets say there were 2,791,111 free men in the Southern States. In terms of age 43% were aged 0 to 14 years old, 52% were 15 to 59 years old and 4% were older than 60. The huge number of youths might be a surprise to some but this is quite characteristic of pre-industrial societies with higher fertility levels and higher overal mortality rates at all ages. At any rate of the free white men roughly 1,451,377 where between the ages of 15 to 59 which can be broadly defined as the group of men capable of bearing arms. Now in the armies of the US civil war you might find people younger as drummer boys or servants and you\u2019d find fewer men towards the higher range of the age group in the army. Some men of that age range would also be unfit for service due to disability or having necessary civilian jobs but we\u2019re still left with a group that\u2019s roughly the number of men the confederacy could field in extremis. Note that Military forces of the Confederate States suggests only 1,050,000, men were in the age bracket of 15 to 59. The actual number of men fielded by the Confederacy is also not known for certain. There were peak actual strengths and total number of men and of course there were Southern men who fought for the union. Administration wasn\u2019t top notch either so we have to work with a range of suggestions from 400,000 up to 1,400,000. Looking at various estimates for the total number of people capable of bearing arms it seems that between 30 and 90 per cent were mobilised for the war. Personally I am of the belief that the percentage was at 50% or lower, say between 400,000 and 730,000 men.  Above: The battle of Franklin during the US civil war. This works out to a range of 7 to 12 per cent of the total free population being fielded in the army. Historians commonly put the percentage right in the middle at around 9 to 10 per cent of the free population of the Southern states. This 10 per cent number is quite significant because a lot of historians use it as a proxy for the number of men tribal societies or complex societies engaging in total war can field. The US for example had 11% of its population in the military during WWII and Nazi Germany possibly up to 14%. However it should be noted that these latter two were already industrialised nations with a different set of demographics. The Confederacy actually matches pre-industrial demographics quite a bit more. Roughly half the population being men, roughly half of those being of arms bearing age and roughly half of those actually being able to be mobilised under ideal circumstances. In Medieval and Early Modern Europe several political entities managed to achieve levels of mobilisation somewhat close to this. Absolutist military monarchies like Sweden and Prussia used compulsory military service to raise vast armies compared to the size of their population. The French statesman Count Mirabeau is supposed to have said that Prussia was not a state with an army but an army with a state. Six to eight percent in conflicts like the Great Northern War and Seven Year\u2019s war are cited here: Mobilization, but personally I have seen some estimates go up to 9 per cent.  Above: Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz: Prussia\u2019s most gifted cavalry commander, seriously this guy basically won Rossbach for Frederick Some of the states in the Low Countries relied on a mixture of having lots of dosh, having high taxes, a good financial system and a veritable flood of foreign immigrants/mercenaries. During the Nine Years war the Dutch Republic fielded around 102.000 men with a population of 1.800.000 or 5.5%, if we include the 25.000 men strong navy this rises to 7%. It is noteworthy that half the army was foreign born and the navy likewise included a high number of foreigners. During the same war the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge fielded approximately one soldier for every 17 to 23 of its inhabitants or 5.7% to 4.3% of its population. This high percentage being achieved with a mix of drafting conscripts and using paid forces. The largest European army for much of the Early Modern age in absolute numbers never got close to the percentages above. During the Nine Years war France managed to raise around 400.000 men with a population of 20 million or 2%. Even the Levee en Masse of revolutionary France raised only 750.000 men out of a population of 25.000.000 so no more than 3 per cent and this number was brought back to 400.000 within a year.  Above: Map of the battle of Fleurus 1690 , note how features like forests and villages form anchor points for the flanks of the armies. During the Nine Years war only the English fielded a smaller percentage of men in the army with roughly 76.000 men for an English and Welsh population of 5.1 million or 1.4% If you add in their 40.000 strong navy you get up to about 2.2%, then again if we add about 2 million Irish and 1.1 million Scots who I believe contributed tax revenue and manpower this percentage might be lower. The figures above though were relatively unique and recent in European history. France could afford to bring its huge population to bear and England could sit behind its Channel moat and thus both could get away fielding a relatively small percentages of their population. Many smaller continental powers didn\u2019t have that luxury. What allowed them to field such large armies was a hitherto unknown power of governments over people. Encouragement/compulsion in the form of allotment systems, conscription and high taxes allowed said Republics or Monarchies to wring large amounts of money from the populace and extract many bodies with a pulse to form the ranks of infantry and cavalry. Such power had simply not existed before in the larger European political organisations. It was a product of bureaucratic reform, wealth, literacy and basically just the general increase in state power that occurred during the 16th and 17th century. During the 16th century populations were not that much smaller but armies were. The French army going from under 100,000 strong during the 16th century to around 200,000 in the early 17th century and then 400,000 during the late 17th century when the French population only grew by 5% indicates as much. As a rule medieval kings, counts or dukes just didn\u2019t have as much money nor any systems to conscript large parts of the population nor could they count on popular enthusiasm or belief in the national cause. Medieval nobles were landowners first and foremost, their income was what we might consider private income today. They did have certain feudal taxes, rights and tolls but a system of comprehensive taxation was rather lacking. Populations were smaller than in 17th century Europe, they were less wealthy and on top of that polities could not extract as much money percentage wise. To phrase it differently; not only was the \u2018pie\u2019 smaller but medieval rulers also got a smaller slice of this already reduced pie. Some nobles could count on some form of selective service but this tended to be restricted. An exception did exist in the form of rural and urban republics or autonomous regions with similar characteristics. However these also illustrate some of the difficulties encountered. Late 13th and early 14th century Florence boasted a population of around 90.000 according to calculations by Giovanni Villani. It had mandatory service in the militia for all men 15 to 70 years of age. Assuming that half the population were men and assuming about half of those were of that age category we end up with a theoretical manpower pool of 22.500 men. Of course in those days men had to arm themselves which meant paupers couldn\u2019t be fielded, the infirm and clergy were also excepted which further lowered this number. Modern historians suggest that really only half of that manpower pool could thus actually be fielded under ideal circumstances. Still this would mean Florence could theoretically field 11.250 men or around 12.5% of its population as infantry, crossbowmen and cavalry. However actually raising that many soldiers for anything but battles right outside the city walls proved to be impossible. Parish registers were used to compile militia lists: those selected were divided in groups of 50, in turn split into two units of 25 \u2013 the venticinquina being a standard subdivision for both infantry and cavalry. The various foot \u2018twenty-fifths\u2019, each including an elected leader, were supposed to serve in rotation under the banner of one of the 20 \u2018Standards of the People\u2019 (Gonfaloni del Popolo), three for every sesto, except for the districts of Oltrarno and San Pier Scheraggio which had four. Cavalrymen came under the banner of the sesto to whom they belonged. \u2026 the substantial Florentine infantry: the artisans, the small tradesmen and the workers who were not just the backbone of the popolo, but also of the city\u2019s economy. For this very reason, only a portion of Florence\u2019s militiamen, other than the cavalry, would be on campaign at any given time, at most the selected venticinquine of three sesti in the case of a major expedition. [around a quarter of the total] Attempting to raise a larger force would mean removing a substantial amount of the city\u2019s workforce, and therefore damaging its economy. In the case of a defeat, the social and material cost could be well nigh crippling. At Montaperti, the Florentine citizenship had sent into the field the infantry of five sesti and suffered 2,500 killed and 1,500 taken prisoner, the vast majority from the \u2018best households of the popolo\u2019, according to Villani. These losses represented about 12 per cent of the city\u2019s male population at the time, about double that percentage if the productive classes are considered- Campaldino 1289; Kelly DeVries, Niccol\u00f2 Capponi The city was organised in six districts or sesti and the men of each sesti were grouped in groups of 50 with half or 25 serving on a rotational basis. At the disastrous Battle of Montaperti five of the six sesti were fielded which suggests between roughly 9000 and 5000 men depending on whether all or only half the venicinquina served. One payroll belonging to Buoninsegna D\u2019Angiolino Machiavelli (ancestor of you know who) suggests 6280 Florentine fought not counting mercenaries hired by the commune. At Campaldino it is likely only three sesti were committed and only half the venticinquine meaning they probably didn\u2019t bring more than 3000 soldiers or around a quarter of their potential. This number still represented roughly 3.3% of the Florentine population so it was by no means a small army and up to 7% were committed at Montaperti not counting mercenaries. Other city states in Italy and a number of autonomous cities in the Low Countries showed similar capabilities, at least for short campaigns. Bruges with a population of 42.000 people reckoned it could theoretically field 8300 soldiers though the actual number was probably lower. On a side note the fact that 17th century states could afford to send 7% or more of their population to die in wars and not cripple the economy probably had a lot to do with the increasing recruitment of poor peasants and urban paupers equipped at the state\u2019s expense. Larger political organisations like medieval kingdoms however didn\u2019t field armies for short periods of time. Campaigns were the affairs of months and when fought between nations they didn\u2019t occur right on the doorstep. If possible they also preferred having more professional soldiers rather than shoemakers dressed in armour. At the start of the 100 years war France managed to field around 50.000 men including mariners out of a population of 17 million or around 0.3%. The 12.000 Englishmen that sailed with Henry V to Harfleur didn\u2019t make up more than 0.4% of the 3 million Englishman at the time. However Henry V also employed armed mariners, a small navy and forces on the Welsh and Scottish border so the total percentage is likely higher. In terms of percentages this doesn\u2019t actually seem to differ that much from ancient times. The population of Athens is reckoned to have been around 350.000 (though some estimates run up to 600.000) at the start of the Peloponnesian war and Athens was assumed to be capable of fielding 13.000 hoplite or a total of 31.800 if the full army was raised and older soldiers were also called in along with a handful of archers and cavalry so we\u2019re looking at 3.7 to 9 per cent, though admittedly a lot of slaves were around and they were ineligible for military service. When we look at individual campaigns of the war though we see the number of Hoplite deployed at any distance from Athens itself numbered in the low thousands rather than then thousand. Around the Greek Peninsula ships were used to deploy troops to distant lands but when armies marched overland they didn\u2019t stray that far from their home city. The peak strength of the Roman Empire in absolute numbers is thought to have been around 400.000 men but at the time the Empire\u2019s total population is believed to have been around the 80 to 100 million mark or around 0.5 to 0.4% of the population. The roughly 250.000 soldiers under the reign of Augustus viewed against a population of 45 million is perhaps closer to the tune of 0.55% of the population. The relative percentage is said to have been higher during earlier Republican days. During the second Punic War the Italian Peninsula Rome seems to have momentarily mobilised 7.5 per cent in late 215, 9.4 per cent in 214, and 11.9 per cent in 212. though these percentages reflect short term levying of the citizenry and not the total population of the Italian Peninsula. Long term the percentage of citizens was closer to 4\u20135 per cent. However If we look at the total population of the Italian Peninsula which also supplied Rome with allies the percentage drops a tad. At a peak such as Cannae around 90.000 Romans and allies fought out of a population conservatively estimated at around 3.5 to 4 million or around 2.25% of the Italian population. However this was rather unprecedented and the loss occasioned a serious manpower shortage and prompted the recruiting of slaves. Outside of such high watermarks we\u2019re probably looking at armies around 1 to 1.1% of the population for the bulk of the Second Punic War. The Barbarians which plagued Rome were much smaller in number but they had one advantage in that they could field a very large share of their population once on the move. A city like ancient Athens or Medieval Florence would strain when it had to deploy seven or ten per cent of its population for any duration of time and especially when the fighting took place more than a week or two marching away. The migrating barbarians on the other hand literally took their city with them in wagons. Their wives and children were with them along with a supply of several months worth of food, they didn\u2019t have much of an economy to worry about and although the movement of their caravan would be slow they could deploy almost the full extent of their manpower where they marched.

            "answer_text": "Yes. The Medieval armies were leaner but meaner - they were based on shock cavalry and archery. The Ancient armies were mainly infantry armies. Infantry is good on staying power, but not on shock power. Infantry is also much simpler logistics-wise than cavalry. It is far easier to raise and upkeep an army of 50,000 infantry than 500 of cavalry. The reason is logistics. Horses eat like horses and while they are fast in the short term, they tire easily on the march and need to rest more than men. Men can carry all their munitions and rations with them or they can be hauled onboard boats by using rivers and lakes as means of transport, while livestock can be marched whilst alive and slaughtered only when needed. Fodder is more difficult - and this is the reason why the Mongols had to maintain their astonishing speed - otherwise they starved. Yet cavalry is much more efficient than infantry. Cavalry relates to infantry in shock value ratio 1:8 to 1:20. Likewise, the Ancients did not field massed archery - that is a Medieval thing. The Medievals preferred to field knights (movement and shock), archers (massed shooting) and spearmen (staying power) as combined arms army rather than masses of infantry. When the Kings managed to unify the nations and crush liberty (an euphemism for Feudalism) all around Europe and infantry proved itself immune to knightly charges due to massed pike formations, the sizes of armies began again to grow. It became now feasible to field massed infantry armies. The knights were now reallocated into officers, and only a small mounted reserve was retained, just as the Ancient cataphracts - to be used for the breakneck charges. This is the same phenomenon as today\u2019s armies based on armour and mechanization. Tanks are the knights of today. They occupy the same ecological niche as shock cavalry (movement and shock). Today\u2019s armies are much smaller than the humongous locust hordes of the WWI and WWII. ",
