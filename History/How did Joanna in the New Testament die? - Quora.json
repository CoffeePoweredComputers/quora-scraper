She was given the choice of death by strangulation or death by crucifixion. Those were the 2 choices Governor Pontius Pilate offered her for penalty for converting Tabitha to Jesus. Tabitha was the servant of Herodias, wife of King Herod Antipas. Joanna was also the servant of Herodias. Her husband had a good job as King Herod\u2019s steward. Mary Magdalene was the servant of Pilate\u2019s wife Claudia. Mary was largely to blame for Joanna\u2019s death and Tabitha\u2019s death. Tabitha was flogged by Cornelius, and soon she died from the blood loss, but Simon Peter raised her from death (in her home village) in the name of Jesus. No mention is made of what happened to the body of Joanna. It was likely too dangerous at this point for the followers of Jesus to request her body from Pilate. So Simon Peter really had no opportunity to attempt to raise her from death. Joanna\u2019s husband, steward of King Herod Antipas, quite possibly was given her dead body for proper burial, but we can only imagine. source: A.D. The Bible Continues, a 12-part made for t.v. mini-series produced by Roma Downey (Touched By An Angel\u2019s, Monica character) and her husband. Available on DVD and Blue Ray.
