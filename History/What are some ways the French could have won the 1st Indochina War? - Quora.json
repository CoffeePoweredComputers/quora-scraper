            "answer_text": "The only way they could have won it is with full US involvement in the war i.e. American boots on the ground as well as extensive US air support. The French did have substantial US aid during the 1st Indo-China War. Despite all of that they still lost. So really the US should have got involved in the war when France was fighting the Viet Minh. To me it seems that it was really stupid for the US not to get involved when the French were fighting the Viet Minh. I believe this because the US got involved anyway in the 1960s. By the 1960s, Ho Chi Minh had established North Vietnam and had the powerful NVA and Viet Cong to repulse the US and Diem\u2019s forces. If the US had got involved when the French were fighting then they would have been able to work with the French to smash the Vietnamese resistance fighters before they could entrench their positions when the French withdrew. The French and the US also should have played the diver and rule strategy. Maybe they could have made an agreement with Diem to get his support for fighting Ho Chi Minh. In conclusion though, full US entry into the war would have been the only way for the French to win. Even then it would have been a tough war to win due to heavy guerrilla warfare being conducted by the likes of the Viet Minh. Furthermore anti-colonialism proponents around the world would have lambasted both France and the US for their involvement in a war to keep hold of a colony. France and the US would have been labelled as evil empires who seek to maintain imperialism. The Second Vietnam War was labelled as an imperialistic war and it was a lot less of a colonial war than the First Vietnam War. After all the Second Vietnam War was about containing Communism, this was backed up by the fact that Diem the leader of South Vietnam actually supported the US\u2019 involvement. ",

They would also need at least several hundred thousand American combat troops on the ground. Complete occupation of Indochina and shutting down the border between China and Vietnam. Socially and culturally? Treat the Vietnamese with more respect, end torture, end mass arbitrary imprisonment, work to build a vibrant middle class in Vietnam with lots of small land owners and small shop owners. ",
