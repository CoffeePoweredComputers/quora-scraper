            "answer_text": "From an English mans perspective the answer is Yes we like each other, there are of course bigots in all nationalities who dislike others for reasons that in truth have no effect on them or are \u201chistorical\u201dreasons. The French, Spanish, German, Vikings and Romans all tried to invade OUR lands , shall we continually cry Foul until armageddon ? No we forgive and move on. The current issues between our nations are to do with the Government in Westminster and in truth we English have just as much of an issue with how the Government works. The vast majority would quite happily cut London free from the mainland and let it sail swiftly into the arms of its beloved EU . We know they're a corrupt bunch of spineless slimey bastards who in any other century would be hung for treason and we are doing our best to get rid of them. I see in the comments \u201cIndependence\u201d mentioned so i would like to comment on that. The majority of we English ( or at least the ones i converse with in the real world or on social media ) have no problem with Scottish , Irish or Welsh independence, we have no issue with a Scottish/Irish/Welsh government making decisions for the benefit of S/I/W ( im not typing the full name anymore) and we have no issues with those countries having full control of their economies and being Sovereign nations in their own right. There are some minor caveats though , we cant keep holding an Independence vote every 5 minutes just because the raging loons woke up in a bad mood, and by raging loons you know exactly who i mean, those idiots will drive you right into the ground. They dont care about Independence they care about their own bigoted egos. That vote money could be better spend on the poor or the NHS. But, an Independence vote means its either IN or OUT and thats it ! part of that agreement is that no matter what the vote belays WE work TOGETHER to help increase our prospective countries worth in the world market and WE work together to ensure our respective governments do not work against our countries best interests to line their own pockets. We do not need 4 Westminster\u2019s and this includes running to the EU like \u2018babes to the tit\u2019 , that is exactly what the EU wants. If you think Westminster is bad just wait until your helping to prop up the Vampires in Europe. Oh and YOU are building the border wall and its your job to police it :P , my tax money is staying in England ",

            "answer_text": "Overwhelmingly, English, Irish, Scots and Welsh really do like each other. You find this most strongly when WE are all overseas. An Englishman can walk into an \u2018Irish Pub\u2019 and meet people from all over the British Isles and we are all pleased to see each other and feel a very strong affinity. The main thing is the fact we all speak the same language and we share huge amounts of culture; foremost among these is humour. So we do get along very well indeed. Irish people are all glad to live in their republic and many Scots (less than half) would support independence - but these people are not hostile to English people. They may criticise the UK government but there is very little ethnic hatred between different people in the UK. Even the IRA did not kill people in England because they were English, they did it usually because they were military or political targets and always because they wanted to force the British Government to change its policy.  There is a tiny, almost minuscule, level of ethnic hatred, it is very small and isolated and it is usually by a tiny group of Welsh and Scots against English people. This tiny extreme fringe usually objects to English people living among them in either Wales or Scotland. They object for a reason - because it somehow diminishes their own community and its sense of self. English migrants to places like Cornwall might elevate house prices and undercut local people. English migrants to places like Gwynedd or the Western Isles may undermine local languages spoken there. There is a reason to the animosity which is not just \u201cracism\u201d but even this is a tiny fringe who are rejected by the vast majority. Extremist groups like Meibion Glynd\u0175r in Wales in the 1970s objected to English migrants in Welsh speaking areas of Wales (see image below). Terrorist groups in Wales and in Scotland have received very, very low levels of support even at their highpoints in the 1970s and have now almost completely died out. By and large, almost always, the people of the British Isles get along extremely well and are friends. I expect a few of the extremists I mentioned will comment on this and say I am wrong, but they are the extreme and very vocal fringe who represent a minuscule group of people.  ",

            "answer_text": "I'll try give an Irish perspective for each of the nations. Scotland: Usually viewed as \u201cthe Celtic brother\u201d to Ireland thanks to their long history of struggles against the English. Nowadays however Scottish people are seen as great lads to have a pint with. There may be a rivalry in rugby, but there's nothing overly special about a football match between the two. (Maybe a few more pints consumed after the match than usual)Welsh: The Welsh are probably best described as a friend of a friend. Very few people would have strong opinions about the country, the occasional \u2018anti-everything British' person may depsise them but those people are few and far between today. In rugby they are often credited with having the best anthem (and the best voices) but in football a Wales match would be less anticipated than for their neighbours of England.English: Ahhh the \u201cancient enemy\u201d. If there is going to be trouble between an Irishman and another nationality you can bet money it'll be with an Englishman. The vast majority of us however have moved on from the mentality of hating everything English. Ironically, a deep hatred of England may stem from knowing not enough Irish history, or too much Irish history (without realising it is history ). Personally, I have more English friends than Scottish or Welsh, but of course at match time I remind them of \u201cthe horrors they committed\u201d, as a friendly joking reminder. Both in rugby and in football there are huge rivalries, however rugby fans tend to appreciate the English alot more than the footballers; as the English were the only six Nations country to vote for Ireland to have the 2023 world cup. Football tends to be a different story, the English have developed an awful reputation in football for hooliganism, Ireland has gone the opposite route and are often the most cheerful fans around. There has been a history of huge trouble, particularly in Ireland after English matches.",

            "answer_text": "Hi This is complicated.. If someone is not familiar with the history of the peoples of these isles.. Let\u2019s run over that history.. Firstly please read this, it will make sense of the next passage: Dava's \u2018Hitchhiker's Guide\u2019 to the Ancient Gauls by David Shaw on Politics. Peace. Intersolar Travel. So if you skipped that, TL :DR style.. Let\u2019s condense at least 20 pages into a paragraph. Gauls came from Ancient Gaul (which is now modern France, east of Spain, inc Catalonia, Northern Italy states) and included these Isles. We were a familial dynastal society. And by an accident of a trade route, we took over a sizable portion of Europe. The remainder of the Gauls being Irish, Welsh, Dumnonii (Kernow), French and we Scots*. We have a 7000 year history and are the original inhabitants of this isle. Sometime early before the millennium, around 500 BC, The Saxons got together and started invading these Isles.. this somewhat abated when the romans invaded .. when they left.. (if reports are to be believed) the Welsh and the Saxons pleaded with them to stay.. some romans stayed and settled as normal citizens, not soldiers. The Welsh started cooperating with the Saxons as they wanted to live like they had under the romans.. at first the Saxons did likewise.. but after a few incidents (raiding) and seeing there was no one to stop them, they invaded Wales. The Welsh were not happy with this, understandably. They fought back. This cycle went on for a few hundred years, until The Welsh King Hywel.. Let\u2019s talk about Hywel for a second.. he was a deeply caring man, kind to a fault, meek, only sought the good of others.. now if you dropped him into say.. the 1700s or 1900s as King of Wales.. he would be heralded as a great King!! But this wasn\u2019t that time.. and his meekness sailed all the Gauls of these Isles down the river for almost a millenia.. his meekness was the root of the bane on every original inhabitant of these isles .. he capitulated to the English King \u00c6thelstan, causing countless generations of misery, funding the slaughter of his cousins for generations to come. Let\u2019s skip ahead a bit to more modern times.. 1707, the Act of Union. Scotland is an owned Country. Scots are overwhelmingly unhappy. Riots in the streets of Edinburgh and Glasgow, lynch mobs out to hang those who sold Scotland for money. over the course of the next hundred years, Scotland was the reluctant bride to England.. misery reigned more than anything else, until Queen Victoria came along (we really liked her and she liked us.. seemingly more than the English) for the first time in the Union we were equal partners, given respect and equal honour by the English.. but when she died, that feeling died soon after. What followed is very hard to describe without a stream of swearing, but I will try. Scots were treated poorly. shabbily and with contempt. We knew the Union was evil, it was born from evil, it must die, as it is evil. Recently.. the English with such utter contempt.. broke the Devolution settlement, and by doing so *may* have invalidated the Act of Union. Section 30 was not granted ascent even though it was competent.. The 2016 Amendment to The Scotland Act 1998 did not gain consent of the Scottish Parliament, but was enacted upon and ruled over by the Supreme Court..The Act of Union states \u2018There should be no higher court in Scotland, than the Scottish High Court\u2019. So do I like English people? I am reminded daily what they think of me.. I have had English friends in the past, good friends.. ones who were not arrogant to me for my being Scots..but really right now, after all the circus of evil and the Evil Empire set to sail off to a Brazil (movie) ending fantasy.. right now I\u2019m down to being tolerantly cordial to English people.. And my Welsh cousins?.. they want to be ashamed of both voting to leave the EU and how quickly Welsh Labour rolled over to have their belly scratched by Theresa May.. from the Country & party who invented the NHS!! At least Plaid Cymru would\u2019ve fought for you! The Irish are the only ones who have been sensible. We Scots the only ones professional. Tensions are high between Scotland and England just now.. and if a Scot who knows what's happening tells you different, they are putting a polite face on it. Hope that provided some insights Kesavan.  *The remainder of the Gauls are.. The Scots mixed with Norwegian, The Irish ,The Welsh and Cornish mixed with the English.. and I don\u2019t think there is any Manx left afaik. (ohw also.. The French mixed with German Franks). ",

            "answer_text": "I will answer from a personal perspective as a Scot. In general and on a social level yes, of course we like the English, Welsh, and Irish. As someone else stated while there are distinct cultural differences between each of these nationalities there are also many areas of cultural overlap and commonality too. We are old rivals in international sports particularly Rugby Union and (Association) Football, so that always engenders banter and slaggings but for most people never to the level of hatred. It seems that we the Scots along with the Welsh and Irish care more about beating the English particularly at Rugby, but that reflects that England is so much bigger than the rest of us combined. Politically in Scotland, those of us who favour Independence are very clear that it is not about the English as a national group but about the failures of the Westminster/Whitehall political and administrative Establishment to deliver for Scotland\u2019s needs. There is of course an element of anti-English arseholeity but by and large that is ignored and even discountenaced by most reasonable and educated people. There is also a small but vociferous minority in Scotland (more often but not exclusively found in the West and largely confined to the support for certain football teams) who have sectarian prejudices and take sides between the Loyalist/Republican dispute in Northern Ireland. However, Scottish people as a whole have positive attitudes towards Irish people as a whole. ",

Welsh people can see through the veneer of the Irish and tend to keep them at arms length. Over the past decade or so a real \u201cRivalry\u201d has built up with the Irish over rugby, problem is that it\u2019s only felt by the Irish, the Welsh don\u2019t really care. We like them as we would a step brother you\u2019d only see at Weddings. Scotland - Sporting wise we\u2019re very close, the Scotland away trips are always massively attended by Welsh rugby fans and to a certain extent it\u2019s the same for the soccer lads. When Scotland are in town people make a special effort to go out and have a pint, in my experience much more so than the English, or Irish. We like each other quite a bit I would say. Like the first cousins you went on holiday with when you were kids. English - This is a slightly strange one as I can only speak for South Wales. If you go along the M4 until Cardiff then the English and Welsh get along with each other very well, tens of thousands of English live in the East of Wales and there are little to no issues. However, when you go further East and leave Glamorgan and therefore Civilisation there are a few people who \u201chate the English\u201d but they don\u2019t really. They are like an annoying big brother but the big brother knows they can\u2019t bully them. ",

            "answer_text": "Nominally, I\u2019m English. I strongly prefer to be called British. Why? Because in terms of identity and belonging, I simply don\u2019t regard people from anywhere in these Isles, including the Irish Republic, as being foreign. Besides being British first, I\u2019d say I\u2019m Northern (English) second. It\u2019s very common for us to have ancestors from across the Isles, especially Ireland and Scotland, hence why on a level of personal identity, uniting them culturally comes naturally. Politically, I am of the left and socially liberal side of things typically, however I am de facto a unionist in the sense of supporting the British Union, not because I\u2019m affiliated with the Unionist parties of Northern Ireland. After all, when one\u2019s sense of nationality has grown from a melting pot of Anglo-Celtic culture, the severing of the Union would quite fundamentally shatter that. I\u2019m quite fond of Wales, Scotland and Ireland. I have written numerous times on Quora about my overwhelmingly positive experiences in Ireland. I\u2019d like to consider myself fairly well-versed in Irish history for a Brit, and naturally as a result my attitude towards Irish separatism is one of \u201cI personally would prefer that we remain countrymen, but ultimately, given the horrors perpetrated by the ruling elites, I can scarcely blame you\u201d. Wales is really the heart of Britishness, in the sense that Welsh culture is the original British Celtic culture. Scotland is the jewel in the proverbial crown, and culturally I think that Scots are the closest to Northerners (despite that seeming to be ignored by Scots) in terms of humour, down-to-earthiness and economically feeling the after-effects of the decline of British industry and the simultaneous policies of Thatcher. \u201cNorthern Ireland is complicated\u201d is the probably the greatest truism I could write, however, it\u2019s a microcosm of Celtic nationalist and British unionist feeling, dressed in Catholic vs Protestant animosity. The issue for myself is that both sides in a broader sense are represented in my background (i.e. Scottish Protestant and Irish Catholic). My admiration for Irish culture and my political support of Britain are awkward roommates. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that uncommon at all in Northern England to be of both sides. I\u2019m going to wrap this up by saying that: I quite like the other parts of the British Isles, I\u2019m fortunate to have friends across them and my sincerest hope is for the best well-being of each and everyone of us. Indeed, once in an Irish pub I remarked \u201cI love Ireland.\u201d and someone I was with overheard me and said \u201cOoo did somebody mention Love Island?\u201d. Good craic lmao. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, this is a bit tricky for me to answer being half Irish and half Lancastrian. I\u2019m married to a half-welsh, half Cornish lady whose grandfather spoke Welsh as his first language. My brother-in-law is Scottish. I\u2019m not untypical. Perhaps I can answer as a local historian in East Anglia. There was once, a couple of hundred years ago, a group of Kentish people who sailed across the Thames Estuary to play a series of cricket matches with the men of Essex. The men of Essex couldn\u2019t understand the Kentish accent and assumed that they\u2019d invaded from France. A fight broke out with \u2018Frenchy\u2019, tempers flared and, I seem to remember, a couple of men were recorded as having been killed in the ensuing fight. The people of East Anglia in those days loathed Londoners, though keen to sell them market produce. There was a sarcastic phrase they\u2019d say when they had done a good job well. \u2018The man from Lonnon coudna have done better\u2019. They treated anyone from outside East Anglia with great suspicion. Anywhere in England, outside East Anglia was referred to as \u2018The Shires\u2019. Paradoxically, they loved the Irish, and successfully raised money to help Famine relief in the eighteen-forties. The British Empire was created by all the many fragmented parts of the British Isles working together to a common purpose. The English could not have managed alone. Nowadays, we occasionally squabble but whether we like it or not, we cherish our differences, but are generally bound by a common heritage. However, Rugby and Footie are a different matter. ",

I have friends in every country that makes up Britain and I will descrbe myself as British - it is inclusive although I do have a friend who when the uneducated call her English rather than British will always say she is Scottish :-) It\u2019s a melting pot :-)Julie ",

            "answer_text": "Speaking as an English person with and Irish and Scottish background, I can safely say I don\u2019t hate the Irish, Scottish or Welsh. Those who hate modern English people, or vice versa, because of history need to grow up. We can rightly be angry at historical atrocities against one another, usually England against everyone else, but we need to understand the context. In terms of invasion and oppression, whilst abhorrent, what country didn\u2019t do this or try to do this way back when? It was the currency of the day. But we also need to realise that the ordinary Englishman, Irishman, Scotsman, Welshman is not to blame. Ordinary peoples had no say back then, they took their orders because they had to and they would have had families to feed. The ordinary man was always used as a pawn by the power hungry. If anybody is to blame for past atrocities it was always those in high society who had control over everything. Now, I\u2019m no Marxist, but facts are facts. Usually the ones who hate one another are disgruntled and uneducated folk who need somebody to blame or take the blow for their anger at life. This usually comes under the form of sport, mainly football. Sport is in many ways the new loyalty for people. Whereas once it was loyalty to ones country, now it\u2019s lotalty to ones team. Hearing how many football fans get enraged during a game, you would honestly think they were at war. Are their genuine hatreds of each other on these islands? Yes, of course, but they are a vocal minority who are always shown in the media. Most people just want to live in peace, make friends and get on with their lives. ",

            "answer_text": "Being from a particularly nationalist area of Wales, I would say that the Welsh hold a certain animosity towards the English. In regard to the Irish and Scottish, they are generally held in quite high esteem as they\u2019re seen as \u2018Celtic Brothers\u2019 (or something to that effect) and also possess Celtic languages perceived to be in decline. The main reasons for the apparent Welsh animosity to the English, I would imagine, can be found in Welsh history what with the continual oppression from the English following the invasion of Wales in the 13th century f.e.: *The loss of the coal mines in the 1980s due to Margaret Thatcher, and resentment to those in England who still admire her *The drowning of Cwm Tryweryn to provide water for Liverpool, and it then not being utilised *The historic use of the Welsh Nott and corporal punishment in schools to punish children for speaking Welsh instead of English in school *The taking of Welsh land historically known as Brecknockshire and Radnorshire which now constitute parts of southern England. *The deaths of Welsh heroes such as Owain Glyndwr and the last prince of Wales \u2018Llywelyn ein Llyw Olaf\u2019 *Even the flag represents the story of the \u2018ancient enemy\u2019 the English what with the Welsh red dragon fighting and slaying the English White Wyvern. I hope this helps somewhat, and would like you to know that this is merely a generalised observation of a predominantly proudly Welsh area, and certainly doesn\u2019t represent everyone in Wales. I myself have absolutely no problem with the English, and certainly don\u2019t hate them. ",
