            "answer_text": "The 1960's. The 60's were, and probably still are the high point of any music genre that was around at the time. The pop was fantastic, with the rise of Girl groups and Phil Spector's \"Wall Of Sound\" production bringing a new sheen. Rock saw the introduction of harder influences that would manifest itself in early Proto-Punk and even Heavy Metal by the end of the decade, while also setting the standard for self contained singer-songwriters within the genre. This was of course borrowed by the Folk and Folk Rock of Bob Dylan, Simon and Garfunkel and the Byrds, artists who still stand as the pinnacle of the genre. R&B was at an all time high, with Motown reigning, but still leaving room for the Southern Soul of Stax and Atlantic. Finally in Jazz, artists were pushing the boundaries, experimenting either with Miles Davis' Modal sound or Ornette Coleman's Free Jazz, with the lasting influence of Hard Bop leading to some integral Post-Bop recordings as well.

            "answer_text": "Let me start off firstly by saying that most of the music from the past few years \u2014 since about 2012/2013; what even? Has writing about breakups and money become the norm for music nowadays? I hate rap music with a passion, and anyone who personally knows me hears my rants daily. I'm not trying to offend anyone, and I hope you understand that I don't like pop or rap, even though I'm a teenager at the moment. Anyways, back to the question at hand. In my opinion, the 70's to 90's have the best music. I'm a rock nut, and I love music from those three decades. For example, the albums I love: Love at First Sting \u2014 Scorpions (1984)Pure Instinct \u2014 Scorpions (1996)Fly to the Rainbow \u2014 Scorpions (1974)The Wall \u2014 Pink Floyd (1979)Dark Side of the Moon \u2014 Pink Floyd (1973)Wish You Were Here \u2014 Pink Floyd (1975)Crazy World \u2014 Scorpions (1990)Amused to Death \u2014 Roger Waters (1990)The Final Cut \u2014 Pink Floyd (1983)There are definitely more, but these are my favourites. Listen to these if you get a chance; they're all amazing. Happy listening, rock \u2014 and non-rock \u2014 lovers! EDIT: I\u2019m deeply sorry if I offended anyone with my remark about rap music; this is simply an (unpopular?) opinion that I thought I should share. I know many teenagers nowadays are obsessed with rap music, and I cannot understand what they see in it. Of course, sometimes some rap songs are okay (and I mean just okay), but most are kind of rubbish. Just out of curiosity, who else agrees? Also, can someone who does like/understand rap music please explain to me what\u2019s so special about it? ",
