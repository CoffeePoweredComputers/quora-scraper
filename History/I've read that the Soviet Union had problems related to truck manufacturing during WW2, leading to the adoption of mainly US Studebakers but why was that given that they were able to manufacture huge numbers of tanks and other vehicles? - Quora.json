            "answer_text": "Because early in war decision was made to switch most of domestic truck production capacity to armoured vehicles instead of trucks. It was taken after evaluating American and British designs on suitability, cost and maintenance efficiency and value for money. Soviet tanks was simply better buck for money and generally far more suitable for frontline conditions. USSR still produced trucks btw, but much less that usually. In a same period they still made about 250 000 trucks. But that given them capability to build over 130 000 armoured vehicles way above Germany or anyone else. ",

Resources that might have been used to build trucks for military transport were used to build armoured vehicles, or aircraft (aero engines instead of truck engines), etc. Building more tanks does not mean you can build more trucks. Steel, electricity, tools, workers - all these are limited. The 400,000 trucks sent to the USSR (mostly by the USA) during WW2 enabled it to devote more resources to other things. ",

Manufacturing is a capital-intensive business and Soviet Russia was an anti-capital political establishment. The biggest problem facing the Kremlin 90 years ago was the agriculture-centric economy that existed then. The Soviet state made its initial grab for power by organizing farming. Their programs were so dysfunctional that millions of people starved as a result. ",
