            "answer_text": "There must have been lousy rulers in the last three centuries: the country is not much bigger than it was at the end of my reign. And look at what they acquired! Avignon? No problem. Savoy, Lorraine? All right, they strengthen our natural boundaries.But Corsica! Just brought a lot of trouble. Without Corsica and Napoleon, France would probably have kept the Spanish-Austrian Netherlands and Rhineland, which it conquered in the 1790s, and are way more interesting. And on the southern side, Catalonia, Piedmont or Lombardy would have been much better.How did you manage to lose Canada and Louisiana? You gave those Englishmen the keys to North America, and then they humbled us worldwide. Really lousy rulers\u2026 what?! my great-grandson! I\u2019m ashamed. Why didn\u2019t God allow me to bequeath the throne to my bastard son the duke of Maine?You say the time of colonies is past\u2026 But after losing the treasures, Canada and India, you wasted your time on a bunch of uninteresting African countries. Can you explain?You have not been up to the English challenge. But how could you miss the rise of Prussia? It could, and should, have been strangled in the cradle. Now it has humbled us in Europe, just as England and its bastard American child have humbled us worldwide.Oh yes, rulers have been quite lousy since God called me home.On the other hand, I see they have continued to support the arts, literature and science. That\u2019s good; their artistic tastes are disputable, though. What\u2019s this glass thing in the Louvre?What a curious French people speak! I can understand them more or less. But their words are strange, their pronunciation is mingled, and they don\u2019t know the basics of the agreement of tenses. Canadians claim they have kept the pure French from my time. But to me they sound like Poitevin peasants \u2014 not surprising, most of their ancestors came from there \u2014 and their speech is so larded with English that I understand them even less. And they\u2019re not better at agreement of tenses.Nobody in the churches!!! I\u2019m horrified and ashamed. My father consecrated France to the Blessed Virgin Mary.Protestants have been ministers, even Prime Ministers! What\u2019s the use of my lifelong struggle against heresy?Jews and Saracens, too?! I\u2019m speechless.I see people much richer and more educated, and more empowered, than in my time. At first I was\u2026 surprised. But I have to admit, it\u2019s better so. France is more powerful than it would be with the illiterate peasants, and the lazy and sycophantic nobles I reigned over. You say it\u2019s precisely because the Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church has been demoted? I don\u2019t believe you. You must be wrong.But these educated and empowered French people have managed to elect such a bunch of inept, corrupt and self-important politicos. How come? How can you claim republic is better than monarchy?Who\u2019s that whippersnapper in the Elys\u00e9e palace, behaving as though he were me? Sorry, Mr. Macron, you\u2019re mixing apples and oranges.",
