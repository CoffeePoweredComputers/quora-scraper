            "answer_text": "That\u00b4s only your opinion because you are not Slavic. Our culture might seem similar to you, and our languages probably sound the same to you, too. But we see huge differences between our way of thinking; our culture is sometimes very different, just like our manners, and there are languages from which we understand maybe like 5 words out of 100. Slavic languages, I mean. And don\u00b4t say: \u201cMaybe it\u00b4s just you because you are stupid, other people are surely more capable.\u201d No. We do not understand everything that some other Slavic foreigner is telling us. By the way, this comics perfectly illustrates the differences between our inter-Slavic relations:   For example, there are Western Slavs, like Polish, Czech, Slovak, and ther regional variants. From them, as a natural-born Czech, I understand maybe 30\u201360 percent naturally. and then I have to guess the rest of the sentence from context. As a result, I will understand 80\u201390 percent of what they are saying. Then there are Eastern Slavic languages, like Ukrainian, Russian and Belarusian languages. Do I naturally understand them, aka without second-guessing? No. Not at all. Maybe like those 5 words out of 100, if any at all. I have no freaking idea of what they are saying to me. They are usually pretty pissed off, especially when they are Russian, because in the USSR, our parents were forced to learn Russian. I was born in the era of communism indeed, yes, but I started attending elementary school in 1992, which is three years after the fall of communism. That was already in democracy, and we were learning German and English. So no, I don\u00b4t understand Russians. But some Russians still see us as their rightful colony, just like the British see the Indians, and they certainly don\u00b4t like it when we tell them we don\u00b4t understand them. And the final linguistic group is the South Slavic language group aka the people who live in the Balkans, or very close to it. Those are the Croatians, Serbs, Slovenians (there are Slovaks and Slovenians, a big difference), Macedonians, and so on. To them, I understand maybe like 20\u201350 percent naturally, and from the context, I can guess maybe like 60\u201370 percent of their whole speech. That is, if I am lucky. But I am second.guessing myself all the time, and I am frequently wrong. And that\u00b4s only the languages. As for the culture, our nations were, just like anywhere else in the world, always influenced by our invaders or neighbours. The Balkans were strongly influenced by the Ottoman Empire, aka the Turks. They long-belonged under their forced rule. You can see it on their style of dancing, clothing, habits, and so on. The style of dancing is usually frantic, with people twirling their handkerchiefs in the air, and hop-hop-hop like dancing, line dances, and men and women dancing separately. Croatian women even have a dance in which they dance with a wine jug balancing on their heads. The Ukrainians, Belarusians and Russians have also a very different style of dancing. Men wear high red wellington boots and pantaloons, loose white shirts, big belts, and a headgear different from the rest of the Slavic groups. In the winter, it is usually something huge, warm and fluffy made out of animal fur (you can buy it in shops, nobody makes the hats anymore). Their style of dancing is more acrobatic. Men float in the air, half-bent, or they drop on their hands, throw legs in the air, and kick very high. Women merrily dance with legs in the air, waving handkerchiefs, or they kind of slowly float in circles. With their long skirts, they look like they are not walking but riding a skateboard. The dancing in general is very bold. The Czechs, Poles and Slovaks - and this time, SLOVENIANS, too, even though they technically belong to the pre-Balkans - are the most different group. All of them - except Poles - were in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, so they are GERMANIZED to a certain degree. You can see it on their dances, habits and style of clothing. Czech Republic especially was under a great deal of German and Austrian influence, because its shape \u201cbites\u201d into the shape of Germany. And we are direct neighbours. The other Slavs call us \u201cLittle Germans\u201d (no kidding), because what we got from Germans was our sense of order, although only compared to other Slavs. In Czech Republic, the order is more like a highly organized chaos, but it is still an order of sorts. The Bohemian part of the country (there are 3 parts, Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia) is the closest to Germany in terms of culture, music, dances and manners, especially when compared to more Slavic Moravia or Polonized Silesia. EDIT: Also, there are religious differences between us Slavs. Eastern Europe tends to be traditionally Orthodox, while Central Europe is mostly Roman Catholic. Balkan tends to be divided between both religions, and mixed with Islam. And that's only the official religious practices. Unofficially, us Czechs are 80+ percent atheist and agnostic (we are the 7th most atheist country in the world, and the most atheist country in Europe), while the neighbouring Poles are the most religious and Catholic country in Europe (along with the Spanish), and one of the most religious countries in the world. They even had their own pope, Jan Pawel II.. That itself obviously creates another friction, especially when the attitudes in the Church influence the thinking of normal people. The Poles are traditionally largely anti semitic and anti-gay rights, while we Czechs don't give a damn. You can be gay here and stick a tongue into your partner's throat here, and while some people will comment about it or have a few remarks, no one actually cares. We are even the most tolerant European nation when it comes to marriage unfaithfulness. It's the beer. We act as if we were stoned 24/7. We are just totally lax about everything. Granted, we are not lazy, but still lax, and we love to complain (how typically Eastern and Central European - even the Germans and Austrians love this\u2026 but not on such a scale), but we are still quite peaceful, at least compared to, let's say, the Balkans. Also, Central Europe in general is more peaceful than their other Slavic counterparts, AND we tend to drink socially, like the Spanish. Meaning, you go to pub to have a beer and make friends. Nobody is drunkenly lying on or even under the table. And when we drink, we usually turn to beer, moonshine and wine. In Eastern Europe, they go to pub or they drink at home to get drunk, and their to-go alcohol choice number one is mostly vodka. And they tend to make out extra reasons why to drink every shot: \u201cTo Putin! To my sister\u00b4s new baby! To my brother\u00b4s divorce from that ugly hag! To today's great dinner! To the shooting of Laika in the space!\u201d I am exaggerating, of course, but this is how it goes there. They think they are just being friendly, while we West Slavs tend to see them as alcoholics.

            "answer_text": "Imagine if your question were \u201cWhy don\u2019t all Germanic (not German!) people create some great Germanic union? Their languages are so similar and cultures too.\u201d So, imagine not only all of Germany, but most of Switzerland, parts of northern France, half of Belgium. Lichtenstein, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, England, South Africa, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Austria, parts of the Czech Republic, and more. We all speak Germanic languages, but even Germans, Austrians, and Swiss can have a hard time understanding each other. People in the Netherlands and Germans both speak Germanic languages, but they have a hard time understanding each other. Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes speak closely-related Germanic languages, but they have to listen carefully to understand each other\u2019s language. Our cultures may have similarities, but there are also large differences. Plus, we may speak Germanic languages, but huge numbers are not primarily Germanic in ancestry. It\u2019s a bit like asking why Israelis, Palestinians, Syrians, and Iraqis don\u2019t all join together because they are all Semites and speak Semitic languages and have plenty of cultural similarities. The differences are too important. Polish and Russian and Slovakian may all be Slavic languages, but that doesn\u2019t mean they share a common language. I\u2019ve only spent a couple weeks in Russia and a week in Ukraine, and I enjoyed both peoples and both countries. Their languages are about as similar as, say, Danish and Swedish. I can tell you, though, that while many Russians and Ukrainians may like each other personally, or be willing to, as a country, Ukraine and the Ukrainians harbor immense resentment of Russia (ruling the USSR) for how it treated Ukraine. Reliable estimates are 3.5 million Ukrainians dead from starvation in two years, thanks to Stalin, one of the great psychopaths of history. Add to that another 8 million who didn\u2019t die but were damaged permanently by the famine. Holodomor - Wikipedia And then there are the millions of Ukrainian war dead where Stalin left them to die. There were millions more as Stalin imposed his regime on Ukraine. (Let me make clear that this was the act of one man and one government, not of individual Russians, who were themselves terrorized and murdered.) This is the story in many Slavic countries. So, no, I don\u2019t think many people in the Slavic countries are eager to join again with Russia. The similarities might lead to areas of agreement at times, but do they get together and say, \u201cHey, we\u2019re all Slavs\u2014why not form one big country and speak one language?\u201d No. Consider the thousands of Ukrainians jailed by the USSR because they chose to speak Ukrainian instead of Russian.
