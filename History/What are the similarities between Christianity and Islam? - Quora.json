            "answer_text": "Both Christianity and Islam stem from Judaism.  They are successive continuations of the same religion.  As such all three share many similarities.  I would say Islam is closer in it's beliefs to Judaism but there are still many similarities with Christianity.  Most of the differences revolve around the view of Jesus and whether or not he had divinity. For comparison sake I will compare all three of these monotheistic religions.  All three believe that God created the universe and that Adam and Eve were the first humans he created.  All three believe that Eve sinned first by eating the apple from the forbidden tree and then Adam did.  Christians believe that this is the original sin and in many cases blame women in general.  This they believe is why women have pain in childbirth and why we suffer on this earth.  Judaism and Islam both reject the idea of Original sin.  While Christians generally say that we are born with a tendency towards sin, Muslims and Jews view us as being born free of sin.  We have equal ability to be either good or evil.  It is our choices in life which make us one or the other. All three faiths claim to believe in one god.  For Judaism and Islam this is a strict Monotheism whereas Christianity has differing views.  Many Christians are closer to what is called monolatry in which there are multiple expressions of one supreme being (the holy trinity for example with The Father(transcendent God in heaven), The Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit/Ghost(the essence that is in creation)).  A few Christians actual view Jesus as a divine being but not exactly God.  This would be sort of a soft Polytheism, Ditheism if they view him as equal to God, or Henotheism if he is lesser than God(or more than).  While the bible specifies Monotheism in the old testament, Christians looking to the new testament and Jesus often are not following a strict Monotheism though they proclaim to be Monotheists and perceive themselves as such. All three believe in Angels and Demons, Islam believes also in Djinn which are like humans and have free will making some good and some evil.  Judaism views only human as having free will and Christianity attributes free will to angels as well.  This is a major point of difference in the three religions.  Judaism does not believe in fallen angels or disobedient djinn because only humans are seen as having the free will to disobey God.  Christianity, again, has varying beliefs about this.  Some believe that the Devil/Satan was a fallen angel and that since angels have free will Lucifer/Satan decided to rebel against God and some angels followed him.  Thus they became demons.  Other Christians view Satan as a reference to a Baylonian King and others view satan as a figurative adversary, human sin and temptation.  Muslims view both Humans and Djin as having free will.  Satan or as Muslims refer to him Shaitan was not an angel who fell but a djinn.  Since Djinn have free will they can be good or evil.  Shaitan is a title meaning cursed.  His name in the Qur'an was Iblees.  Iblees once resided in heaven alongside the angels but he refused to bow down to Adam when God presented him to the rest of his creations in heaven.  The angels do not have free will so they do everything God tells them to do.  the Djinn however choose for themselves.  Iblees being jealous of Adam and viewing him as a lesser being refused to bow down.  He thus disobeyed God and promised to lead people astray to show God how unworthy we are of him.  Thus he became \"cursed\" and takes on the title of Shaitan.  As you can see the concepts of the three religions vary quite a bit here. All three have similar books.  The Torah is essentially the Old Testament of the Bible and the New Testament is the part which Christians largely follow viewing it as abrogating the old testament.  The New Testament deals almost exclusively with Jesus and in many ways attempts to explain why Jesus is the Messiah despite not meeting the conditions laid forth in the Torah for the Messiah.  The Qur'an does not include the Torah or Bible in it, instead it makes references to stories in them and prophets.  All three view the start as being Adam and the covenant was enacted with Abraham/Ibrahim.  Thus they all share the same prophets and similar stories although Islamic accounts sometimes vary slightly from the Christian/Jewish texts.  The differences really revolve around Jesus here.  In Judaism because Jesus did not meet the requirements set forth in the Torah/OT for being the Messiah, he was seen as nothing more than a false prophet.  Christians viewed him as the messiah and largely considered his supposed resurrection as a sign of divinity and his dying on the cross as an atonement for our sins.  Muslims view Jesus as a great prophet who will fulfill the role of Messiah in his second coming.  Both Christians and Muslims believe Jesus will return and fight the anti-Christ/Dejal (although some Christians believe this battle already took place (I never got that one so I can't explain the ideology behind it).  Muslims believe that Jesus didn't die on the cross.  they believe that God made another person look like him and then Jesus was ascended to heaven whole and alive.  When he returned after his supposed death he wasn't resurrected but rather was simply saying goodbye as a still alive human being before ascending to heaven.  He will then return alive and live out the rest of his days here on earth before the day of judgment. Judaism and Islam follow similar dietary restrictions such as no alcohol and no pork. Judaisms restrictions for Kosher exceed what is required by Islam though.  In Islamic Halal food it is almost exclusively in how an animal was killed and whether a prayer in God's name was said over the meat.  While this is one aspect of Kosher foods, Kosher actually extends to not mixing certain types of foods and some Jews even maintain two sets of utensils and some even two refrigerators in order to keep things from mixing.  Most Christians see these restrictions as being abrogated by Jesus dying on the cross. All three believe in a heaven although some Jews say there is no afterlife.  Christians and Muslims both believe in hell in which the wicked will burn forever.  Jews have varying beliefs in which some believe in hell others believe in no afterlife and some believe in reincarnation.  Muslims also believe in a purgatory of sorts in which believers who did not repent enough or do enough good may end up in hell for a short time until their sins are purified from their souls after which they will be allowed to enter heaven.  Some Christians believe in a similar type of existence which they call purgatory although for many that is a place where one is neither in heaven nor in hell and cannot leave to go to one place or another. All three religions believe that salvation comes from belief in God and most believe one must also do good deeds.  Some Christian groups say that good deeds are unnecessary because Jesus died for our sins so all we have to do is believe in him.  Muslims believe that in addition to belief and good deeds that one must believe in the 5 pillars of Islam and the 6 pillars of Belief.  Some Christians also believe that sacraments are necessary. Each of the three accepts any predecessor to be true and views it as a continuation but all view any successors as false.  There are many similarities between all three religions and many similarities between just Christianity and Islam.  More than could probably be accurately represented here in Quora.  It would take an entire book to really delve into it. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many similarities between Christianity and Islam (rather than Islamic beliefs) if by that you mean refined and theologically developed, systematized beliefs. Below I will list some of them and explain. Judaism share many of these beliefs too. Belief in one God. Judaisim, Christianity, and Islam agree that there is only one, omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, infinite, good, and just God who is the Creator of all and who cannot be fully or totally or completely grasped by creatures. But these faiths also disagree how to exactly understand oneness of God. They agree that God is one in a sense that God is unique and uncountable. But Christianity also teaches that somehow this one God is in three persons (persons here is technical term and it does not mean individualized objects or things): Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Islam and Judaism disagree with Christianity\u2019s one and three approach to oneness of God (Trinity) seeing \u201cthree\u201d as a sign of corruption of monotheism that these faiths share. They all somewhat agree that this one God has agency and person-like attributes. He is not just impersonal force though impersonal dimension of God is not denied either.Belief in (God\u2019s self-) revelation. Christianity and Islam also agree that this one God revealed herself (or himself?) in nature (called general revelation) and in history or tradition or individuals (called special revelation). But they have disagreements here about how much and in what ways or in what events God can reveal (or have revealed) herself. For example, Christianity takes Jesus Christ to be God\u2019s incarnation. Jesus Christ is Word of God (The son is incarnated as Jesus Christ). He has human and divine nature and he is worshipped in Christianity. To a Christian Jesus is the ultimate, unique and most mysterious of revelation. Islam, however, does not see Jesus Christ as God\u2019s incarnation because it refuses incarnation of God in any creature to the point that it would make that creature to be worshipped or to be identified with God. Instead, Islam teaches that Jesus Christ is only one of many prophets. That brings us to their third similarity.Belief in prophets and prophethood. God called some people to share revelation or insight or message from God to all humanity. Christianity and Islam share several common prophets but their understanding of these prophets\u2019 role and office have differences. For example, Moses, Jesus, Joseph, Noah are all considered to be prophets in Christianity and Islam. But Christians are ambiguous about Muhammad as a prophet because of his teachings do not agree with some important Christian teachings and Muslims refuse Jesus\u2019 divinity and some of his teachings where Jesus identifies himself with God in some ways.Belief in existence of sacred texts called scriptures. Christianity and Islam (and Judaism) agree that certain divine teachings were captured and passed down to us in texts. Compare it to some oral belief traditions like Shamanism where concept of holy text or scripture never even existed. Moreover Christianity and Islam share in some ways some of the scriptures but even here they disagree about many things. Muslims formally recognize that the Gospels and the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) were sacred but today mostly the Qur\u2019an (sacred text of Islam) corrected some of previous scriptures\u2019 wrong teachings and partly replaced them. So you won\u2019t find Muslims to use the Bible in their liturgy (worship tradition) but the Qur\u2019an does acknowledge religious importance (or sacred origins) of Gospels and Hebrew Bible. I don\u2019t want to go into details of this very complicated and ages-long issue \u2014 just suffice it to say that their relationship to scriptures is pretty complex and is difficult to understand unless you have good familiarity with religious discourse.Belief in heaven and hell (in traditional expressions of these faiths), end times, judgment day, providence, resurrection and many other things.These (and many more) shared elements are why often you see someone to name all three faiths Abrahamic religions. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam come from common tradition and share core concepts. Moreover, they all come from the ancient cultural region: Middle East, more broadly from Mediterranean world. That\u2019s why Christianity and Islam are closer to one another than either one of them to Taoism or Hinduism. ",
