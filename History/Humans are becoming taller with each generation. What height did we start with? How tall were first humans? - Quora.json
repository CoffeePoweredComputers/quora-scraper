            "answer_text": "A Fascinating Answer on Human Growth Turkana Boy  This is the story of Dr. Richard Leaky\u2019s Last Great Find In 1984, Dr. Leaky was still working on fossil finds in the area around Lake Turkana Kenya. One of Leaky\u2019s team uncovered a fragment of what looked like a Homo-Erectus. Soon the entire skeleton \u2013 brand new to science \u2013 were uncovered. It was the first human skeleton ever discovered and he was called \u2018\u2019Turkana Boy.\u2019\u2019 (Sometimes called Narakotome Boy) The find was on the bottom of an ancient lake-bed, semi-face down and caught on the rocks. Leakey knew to follow the path of the ancient river. More bones were found in the silt. And as the boy\u2019s body began to decompose, its genetic materials were disintegrating. It became a quest to uncover what caused his death. Compared to the Australopithecines around him, there were stark differences. He was with smaller brow, but his bones were huge. From the shape of his backbone and pelvis, we know he was highly mobile. He apparently shared the landscape with others much like himself and bore the name \u2018\u2019Homo-Ergaster\u2019 (\u1f10\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1) or \u2018\u2019Working Man.\u2019\u2019 It was suspected that Turkana Boy suffered from a congenital disorder, either of dwarfism or scoliosis. This was because the rib bones appeared asymmetrical to the spine and the reason was attributed to skeletal dysplasia.\u202a[15] However, in 2013, a new study shows that when the rib bones were carefully rearranged, it became symmetrical against the spine, and that unusual structure of the vertebrae was characteristics of the early hominins. However, the fossil definitely showed lumbar disc herniation, an injury implicated with his death.\u202a[16] He also had a diseased mandible. His skeleton tells us he was 5\u20193\u2019\u2019 tall. At first glance he looks like he was a young teenager. His skull has a large brain capacity and lower forehead but otherwise is remarkably close to modern humans. His overall body shape is just like ours. His jaw was lower and larger, and had a more forward position of their palms when they ran. This is evident to the fact that there is a slight twist in the shoulder blade. In order to reconstruct his life, we needed to further examine his skeleton. Had he grown to his full height, this ancient hominoid would have been an exceptional sight to see. He probably would have been well over 6\u20195''. This is unlike any other homo today. On the lakeside plains of Eastern Africa, this boy\u2019s structure was completely new to us. As mentioned, he was huge. In fact, had he been alive today, he might well be the strongest human alive. His muscular structure was much like ours but there was a subtle difference in the tibia and fibula. These were actually longer in Turkana Boy than in any homo-sapien alive today. Almost at once, questions arose regarding some of the more unusual traits uncovered by Turkana Boy. In order to understand just how he died, we need to examine how he lived. Unraveling this mystery would uncover startling finds in our own human story. In order to accomplish this \u2013 we needed to answer some crucial questions. Why did he grow to such a height at such a young age? Initially, anthropologists hadn\u2019t considered the importance of childhood development in ancient hominoids. But humans have a relatively long childhood when compared to apes. We don\u2019t reach maturity until we are about fourteen or fifteen, resulting in a longer time of dependency on parents for survival and protection. In contrast, apes have a much shorter childhood and are sexually mature when they reach about seven years of age. In order to survive, the growth of Turkana Boy was more like a chimpanzee. As humans evolved our childhood was extended. A chimpanzee's brain will be fully developed by the age of three or four. With humans it can be almost twenty years before the brain is fully developed. This is the mystery of prolonged childhood, and it is something that took anthropologists many years to uncover. Homo-Erectus had no advantage in having children with a long child-cycle where there was dependency on the parents. And this is how we find Turkana Boy. He walked upright and was blessed with a brain twice as large as a chimp but still decidedly smaller than our own. In the brain of Turkana Boy, we initially assumed he had the gift of communication. But we did not know just what that communication would have been like. His brain had a slight slant in the cortex, which is imperative for speech. But like any good mystery - we uncovered evidence to the contrary. This is crucial to developing a written story. The ability to make speech is a must in developing any kind of society. _____________ ",

            "answer_text": "Uh..., nope. Height is a trait dependent on genetics and environment and none of this factors is lineal. We have varied sizes in every population so height can oscillate between tall and small as needed adaptation to environmental changes. Actually, to be able to select mean sizes for a specific population in time is a more flexible mechanism than having to evolve to confront environmental changes, it provides for better survival advantages and less genetic adaptation. I think the more we advance into Modernity and assimilate technologies, the better quality of life leads to apparent increases in size due to environmental factors being better controlled, though this effect is again non lineal. Nowadays height is not necessary to survive, at all. It was the Greeks who discussed and proposed the measures of the athletic body, and established the classical proportion of seven heads to one body, up to the heroic proportion of nine heads to one body. The measure may not be perfect but it does seem we all can judge a human body as being well proportioned or not, which given natural constraints to effective functioning of organs and limbs, gives us a minimum height for which a well functioning body can be recognized as well proportion. It is very likely our first recognizably-human specimens oscillated around such minimum height plus some deviation up to allow for height adaptation to the environment. ",
