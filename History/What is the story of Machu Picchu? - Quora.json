            "answer_text": "Incans were a small tribe engaged in constant warfare with other tribes of the region. It was during this time came \u2018Pachacuti\u2019 who was believed to be \u2018Son of Sun\u2019. He improved upon the Incans\u2019 the knowledge and methods of agriculture and stone masonry. Incas flourished under Pachacuti\u2019s rule. Instead of using military rule Pachacuti sent food and treasures to neighboring communities which eventually accepted the Inca\u2019s way of living, expanding the empire.  Pachacuti commissioned the building of the city \u2018Machu Picchu\u2019 on the hill around 80 kilometers away from the capital city of Cuzco. Machu Picchu was built on a hill closer to the Sun as an observatory for the King. Though said to be king\u2019s winter resort archaeologists estimate that around 1000\u20131200 people used to live in this city. Machu Picchu has 8 main roads going outwards which spread and connected the whole empire.  A century later arrived the Spanish conquistadors , who were amazed by the complex Incan roads which in total covered a distance of almost 40,000 kilometers. The conquistadors invaded the Incans and used the roads to travel to different cities to destroy them. Fearing the Spanish conquistadors, the residents of Machu Picchu abandoned the city and fled. The Spanish conquistadors destroyed the city of Cuzco and other places but Machu Picchu was left alone as they could not find it. Eventually the city got covered in vegetation.  It wasn\u2019t until 1911, when an explorer named Henry Bringham III, with the help of the local farmers discovered the city covered in vegetation. ",

            "answer_text": "Prafful answer is quite good but I differ on the \u201cdivine\u201d explanation of Pachacuti (Pachacutec in Spanish language), actually Pachacutec original name was Cusi Yupanqui, son of the eight Inca, Huiracocha . The biggest enemy to the Inca expansion was the Chancas tribe, during one of the stages of war, Inca Huiracocha and his son (the heir to the throne) fled the city, at that time, Cusi Yupanqui took the leadership and after allying with only one neighboring tribe they defeated the Chancas and saved the city of Cusco, Inca Urco (heir to the throne) tried to kill Cusi Yupanqui (Pachacutec), but was defeated and killed. Only after that Inca Huiracocha decided to pass the mamaipacha (the \u201cCrown\u201d or symbol of power) to Cusi Yupanqui and named him Pachac\u00fatec Yupanqui C\u00e1pac Intichuri which means Son of the Sun, who transforms the World. Pachacutec warfare hability, leadership conditions make him the best Incas along with his son Tupac Yupanqui. He is not a \u201cdivine figure\u201d who taught the art of agriculture or masonry to the Incas, they already knew how do to those things but Pachacutec wisdom make them to use said knowledge in the right and better way. After conquering Vilcabamba and the mountain Picchu, Pachacutec was astonished by the area and ordered to build a urban complex (circa 1450). Machu Picchu - Wikipedia ",
