            "answer_text": "I did it when I was 27. I was born in 1950, and was given the name Gay Elizabeth Flygare. My parents had some friends with a little girl named Gay who had red hair, and she was darling. Mom being a redhead, my parents fell in love with the name. Naturally, my paternal grandmother detested it and begged my parents to use their original choice (and oh, how I wish they had), which was Karen Elizabeth. But my mom had quite had it with her mother-in-law telling her what to do, so she stuck to her guns - and Gay I was. Of course, it meant - at the time - \u201cblithe, cheerful, joyous.\u201d The problem was that I was a rather morose little girl. In fact - and I remember this clearly - when I was four, I asked Mom, \u201cWhy did you name me Gay? I\u2019m not a happy child.\u201d I have also had a musical ear all my life, and Gay Flygare - all those y\u2019s and g\u2019s - well, it always sounded guttural to me, like some sort of nasty insect repellent. Gay would have been OK if our surname had been Merrill or Kingsley or Prentiss\u2014or something romantic like Broussard. But if you are a Flygare, you need to name a daughter something like Allison, or Melissa, or Catherine. (One of my sisters did get the name Catherine; the other three got normal names also, which added to my discomfort; I felt like a misfit!) School started. I was called \u201cKay\u201d and \u201cGail\u201d and \u201cFlying Cigar.\u201d It was unbearable. In seventh grade I started to spell it \u201cGaye,\u201d thinking that would make it more sophisticated. Hah. It just made people think I was named Gayle. Off I went to college in 1968. Imagine my distress when my friend Victor had to take me aside and tell me, \u201cYou can\u2019t introduce yourself to people saying \u2018I\u2019m Gaye.\u2019 \u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked innocently. He made a limp-hand gesture and told me, \u201cGay means \u2018queer\u2019.\u201d I think I went into shock. I had had no clue. I am not and never was a homophobe, but my parents\u2019 generation had a harder time getting used to the changes in society. So it was to their great relief that at age 27, having had enough of a name I hated regardless of what it meant, I decided to drop it and go by Elizabeth. Mom was so elated that she sent me a card with a tree on it; the inscription on the inside was \u201cNature\u2019s Loveliness Reminds Me of You.\u201d At work, the lady who brought the mail around to the departments was a bit of a loudmouth, so it was no problem getting people to call me Elizabeth\u2014she made sure to spread the word. In fact, very few people had trouble adjusting. I had a desk in the center of a large room and I had a nameplate, which helped. We also had name tags. I didn\u2019t know what to do about a middle name, at the time, so I had my paychecks made out to G. Elizabeth Flygare for years. People I met after I dropped my first name never knew the story, because I never divulged my first name. Ever. It\u2019s only been since the advent of Facebook that I\u2019ve had to out my first name so my old friends can find me. At this point, I really don\u2019t care who knows. It makes me mad in a way, because even though I disliked the name, I did NOT stop using it because it began to mean what it means now. I always think that others assume that that\u2019s why I dumped the name. It isn\u2019t. I wanted a beautiful name and I loved my middle name, Elizabeth. At age 47, the year my father died, I discovered the name \u201cAisling\u201d on the cover of a CD. It is the name that Enya\u2019s sister, Maire Brennan, gave her daughter. I found out that it meant \u201cdream\u201d or \u201cvision\u201d in Irish Gaelic. We are Swedes, but my dad loved everything Irish - and I loved the name Aisling, so I added it to give myself a middle name. It is supposed to be pronounced ASH-ling, but I have a grand-niece named Ashley, so I just pronounce it Aisling (AIS-ling - long A). Just a year or so ago, one of my cousins told me that back in 1977 when I dropped my first name, Dad wanted me to choose Amanda as my middle name, as it is a family name and appears all through the genealogy charts on his side of his family. Why didn\u2019t my parents tell me that? I would have! The funny thing is that I would have given that name to my daughter if I had had one, and actually I did toy with the idea of using it for a middle name. But I\u2019m used to Aisling - and I\u2019m 67, so I will live out my days as Elizabeth Aisling Flygare. By the way, I found out that the cute red-headed girl I was named after changed her name, too. So did another girl I knew in school who was stuck with the name Gay. I also learned that my parents had considered \u201cElizabeth Gay\u201d for me, and they were going to call me \u201cBetty Gay.\u201d Ugh. I can\u2019t stand any of the Elizabeth nicknames! My boyfriend calls me Lizza, which makes me very happy. I guess it all worked out, when I think about it. And it makes a great (and true) story. And there is one thing I miss about the name Gaye - it was fun to write. ",

            "answer_text": "Michael has it well covered. I\u2019ll just add some extra points. It will take work - sticking to the story may be tough, or not, depending on how motivated and attentive you are. If you strictly introduce yourself with the middle name from this point forward, it should be effective with new acquaintances. Here\u2019s where it gets tricky - if you want everyone to use your middle name, you\u2019ve got a lot of work. Think of how many people already know you. You\u2019ll have to begin \u201ccorrecting\u201d them and explaining the new situation. That sounds like a big pain to me, but if you really want it, it may be worth it. People may fight you on that, especially relatives, as Michael alluded. They may like your old name. Even if they\u2019re open to the change, they may keep slipping back to the old name by mistake. I remember one time meeting a friend\u2019s mom, who called him some other name, so this may have been a case like that. I asked him about that, and he changed the subject. I thought, hmmm, O-K. I would say the easiest scenario is when you move somewhere new. Then there\u2019s no legacy of the other name. The case that comes to mind is going away to college. My mother actually tried that, but finally gave up because she couldn\u2019t remember to stick to the story. It occurs to me that someone who could stick to a new name may have one qualification for being a secret agent (or a criminal!). :) ",
