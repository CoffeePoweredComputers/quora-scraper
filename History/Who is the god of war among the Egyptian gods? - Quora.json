            "answer_text": "There are two regional candidates. One candidate might be Montu, a minor, hawk-headed deity that was thought to embody the warlike nature and martial prowess of the Pharoah. He was worshipped in Thebes, primarily, rather than other areas of Lower Egypt. The second candidate might be An-Hur (aka Anhuret). He was the god specifically of the Egyptian armies, and he was worshiped in the region of Abydos and more specifically in Thinis. His epithet was \u201cSlayer of Enemies,\u201d and part of his worship involved staging mock battles. In mythic genealogy, he was one of the sons of Ra. However, there\u2019s arguably no good, direct analogue to Mars or Ares in the Egyptian pantheon, even though the Greeks equated An-Hur with Ares occasionally. ",
