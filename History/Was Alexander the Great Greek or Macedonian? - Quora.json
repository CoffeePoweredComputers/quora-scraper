            "answer_text": "'The further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those that speak it.'George Orwell Does wishful demagoguery shape this discussion around the ancient Macedons? It is understandably that sophists from the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic want to adopt the Glory of Alexander III of Macedon for themselves. Success has many fathers failure is an orphan. Lets read what historical sources say about the ancient Macedons and ancient Greeks in the Army of Alexander II.. Our goal will be to find the truth in the ancient documents not win an argument and adopt the fame of the Macedons for any modern nation. There is one surviving biography of Alexander the Great writen by Quintius Curtius Rufius from 50 AD. Unfortunatly sophists don\u2019t wont to read historical documents/sources \u2013 they would rather repeat claims and twist facts. The sophists goal is to win an argument, not the find truth. Quintus Rufus mentions 3 eyewitnesses and participants in Alexander\u2019s story: Cleitarchus (camp historian) Ptolemy and Timagenes. Besides that his book is the only surviving biography on Alexander surviving 2000 years. The relationship between a master and servant becomes evident starting with p.43:When a rumor is spread in Thebes that Alexander had died in Illyria the Thebans revolt against the Macedon garnison and surround the fortress. Alexander comes to Thebes and annihilates most Thebans (that did not run away in time).. Very few were spared.True his military power over the Greek polis Alexander forces them to elect him leader. First battle at river Granicus (Quintus, p.43): Alexander alone with the Macedons crosses river Granicus and decided the war. He \u201chas to share victory with the Greek mercenaries so that they can be more helpful in the rest of the war\u201d. Page 52: Alexander considers that if he is defeated in an early battle \u201ethe Greeks could no be counted to remain faithful\u201c. On every page oft he book there is a clear distinction between ancient Macedons and ancient Greeks. P.54: alexander sends home over the winter (as present) all Macedonian soldiers who are newly wed/married.P.62 Darius has 40.000 Greek mercenaries under his command and appoints new commander tot he Persian Greeks. Greek mercenaries are a huge part oft he Persian army. P.63 Before battle Alexander addresses every nation in his army differently. The Macedons are promised as bonus the spoils of the Orient while the Greek mercenaries who just get a monthly salary are reminded of what Xerxes did to their forefathers.Illyrians and Thracians are promised booty/bonus just like Macedons! P.67 Athens begs Alexander to free Greek prisoners who fought on Persian side. Alexander usually free Greek prisoners not to alienate his own Greek mercenaries and so that Greek who live in Persian towns can surrender easier knowing that they will be spared and not even sold in slavery. P.75 The rest of Darius army had 30.000 young Greek soldiers in Mesopotamia. P.103 Macedonians love and devotion to their king is shown, Macedon soldiers kiss the hand of the healer of the King! It becomes obvious that around the Kings tent only Macedonian soldiers are allowed to camp. Greek mercenaries are in a separated area.Page 113: Alexander considers the 30.000 Greeks with Darius to be \u201cflower of the Persian army\u201d and the only match for the Macedonian phalanx. Page 169 Amyntas (Athenian?) deserts to Darius with 4 Greek mercenaries.Page 211 \u201cGreeks have wavering minds, Alexander can not trust them\u201dPage 213 3000 Greek mercenaries (in a garnison) betray the Persian King and join the Macedons.Page 241 Athens sends envoys again to beg for the lives of Greek prisoners.Page 257: Darius tries to bribe Greek mercenaries, Alexander doubts their loyalty.Page 341: The bodyguards of Alexander are 50 sons of only Macedonian chieftains. Refreshment come after the winter: 3600 Thracians, 3000 Macedons and 4000 Greek mercenaries were hire from the Peloponnese. The payment after the 3rd big battle with Darius is as follows:Macedons receive 600 drachmae \u2013 2 years pay for a skilled workerThracians and Illyrians receive 300 drachmae \u2013 1 years pay.Greek mercenaries receive 2 months salaries (no number is mentioned, but stronger mercenaries might have received more than weaker)!! The difference between ancient Macedons and Greeks becomes clear. P 345 The word \u201crace\u201d is defined. Every army has a commander of its own race.P 407: Patrol from Athens leads 50.000 Greeks for Darius. In battles of Alexander against Darius 40.000 Greek mercenaries played by Macedons fight against 50.000 Greeks played by Darius. Some of them might have been even related \u2013 it is a non zero Probability that ancient Greek brothers killed Greek brothers for monthly salaries! Clearly Alexander killed many Greeks on the Peloponnese to subdue them, he killed many Greeks fighting for Darius and also spared many Greeks to ensure stability and easier wins \u2013 this is stated by camp historians in his army, its not a 21st century fantasy! Are present day Greeks and Macedons genetically descendant of Alexander? Low chance \u2013 all children of Alexander are reported dead. Any genetically descendants of the Macedon soldiers? Possibility high in modern day North Greece \u2013 Hellenized descendant, in present day Macedonia \u201cSlavicized\u201d descendant, south Bulgaria, and also Turkey \u2013 \u201cturkoyfied\u201d descendants! People on the Peloponnese are more likely connected genetically to the Greek mercenaries (on Persian AND Macedon side)! ",

            "answer_text": "With due respect, this question is rather moot, and represents a severe misunderstanding of history and cultural identity and civilization, which is perhaps not your fault, but is rather the fault of recent political machinations driving misinformation and disinformation. Unfortunately, there are some dumb questions, contrary to the old adage that \u201cthere are no stupid questions\u201d, because they are the product of severe political propaganda. This is not against you for asking the question (unless it was purposefully in that direction), but is rather against the deeper causes of the question. Make some tea and read on so I can explain why, because it requires a brief history lesson and analysis. I promise it will be a very interesting read. Firstly, the most succinct answer to your question is very simple: Spartans, Athenians, Cretans, Rhodians, Syracusans (southern Italian Greeks), Korinthians, and Macedonians are region-specific localities of tribes of Greek people. They are all Greeks. Now, on to the juicy part: If I may guess while unpacking the causes of your question, the root of the overt confusion in your question stems from today\u2019s newfangled slavic \u201cFYRO\u00abM\u00bb\u201d (former yugoslav republic of \u2018makedonija\u2019), or as is recently entitled, \u201cNorthern Makedonija\u201d which was not, and is not, a Greek state, nor a Greek nation, nor \u201cMacedonian\u201d for that matter, (although it may contain some Slavic-speaking and Greek-speaking Greek nationals in its mainly Slavic population). It is a country that has simply stolen a Greek identity in the form of a name, most literally, and is trying to usurp and squander that national and historic identity in forging a new nation out of it (which is currently undergoing the process of ethnogenesis). The real name of this state was, until very recently, and for a very long time, Vardarska. So, although other researchers in this thread have more or less fully addressed your question in full and rigorously, I will add another layer that is not addressed and unpacks the reasons why you may have even asked such a question, because no one really truly answers the why you asked such a question which is the real issue here. let\u2019s put it bluntly, you would not ask \u201cwas Moses a Jew or a Semite\u201d, would you? You would not ask \u201cwas Emperor Quin a Chinese or a Zongguo\u201d, would you? You wouldn\u2019t ask \u201cwas Octavian a Latin or a Roman\u201d? All of these questions are ridiculous, aren\u2019t they? Certainly. So why is it that a question such as \u201cwas Alexander Greek or Macedonian\u201d, which is just as utterly ridiculous, not as immediately obvious as all the other similar questions? The answer rests in recent political propaganda, and more accurately in the reasons why such a question needs to be asked in the first place, by many people these days. So what is this Vardarska? Vardarska was part of the Yugoslavian Empire, then Yugoslavian Kingdom, and remained known as \u201cVardarska\u201d as this region evolved, well until the 20th century, for about 400 years. Before, it did not exist. Its then national identity as Vardarska did not exist before that time, and most certainly nothing of its current claims on a supposed \u2018Macedonian\u2019 identity did not exist either. until about 1939, Yugoslavia had maps, documents and coins and stamps with \u201cVardarska\u201d for the exact region known today as the country of \u201cnorthern Makedonija\u201d or until a few months ago also known as \u201cFYRO\u00abM\u00bb\u201d. That it was called Vardarska for a long time can be confirmed in coins, maps, postage stamps, school books and other books, letters, government documents and legislature, and a multitude of thousands of documents and paraphernalia. There is no question whatsoever that the region now being forcibly called \u201cNorthern Makedonija\u201d was actually called \u201cVardarska\u201d. That this change was made is for political reasons, not historically accurate reasons for such change, nor any actual \u201cmacedonian\u201d ethnicity in that region. Vardarska bears no connection to Alexander. None whatsoever. But it causes severe misunderstandings with what is today dubbed \u201cMacedonian\u201d and what being Macedonian meant for Alexander, which invariably meant being Greek. Hence your question. The unfortunate circumstances of the Vardarskan Yugoslavs is that Yugoslavia was weakening at the start of the 20th century. During the period of WWII, and of course later the dictator Tito who was turning to and from fascism as an active Nazi himself, Hitler had visited the region and devised a master plan to create a \u201cMacedonian Region\u201d with Ivan Mihailov as the mastermind to implement it. You can confirm this in the letters of Hitler to Ivan Mihailov in Yugoslavia (and later furthered by Tito) as well as letters to Boris in Bulgaria, whom they also enlisted for help in annexing land from northern Greece, from western Bulgaria and from southern Yugoslavia to forge such region, by cleaning it of Jews and gypsies, and utilizing its geopolitical and strategic location. Massive propaganda was launched to this end. This can be found in archives pertinent to WWII propaganda that practically initiated Boris, Mihailov (later Tito\u2019s) and Hitler\u2019s, with the aid of Boris\u2019 strategy, to construct a satellite state with immense geopolitical and military importance. There are also Russian-Soviet propaganda adverts pushing for the exact same identity forge, just asking Vardarskans to turn Macedonian, sure, but from within Russian influence. Thus begins the sham of a \u201cMacedonian\u201d identity for the poor Slavs of Vardarska, who have been duped for three generations now, as pawns in the geopolitics of the agenda of greater powers. The forging of the national identity required a couple of gambits to put it into motion, and the primary gambit was leveraging the name of the geographic region as a name for the wider vicinity. Effectively, the geographic region of Macedonia had never been as far north as it was needed to make this plan possible, from antiquity till that time, so they needed to make the population believe that the region as far north was, in fact, called \u201cMacedonia\u201d. To this end, the idea of ignoring the original regional naming of the Greeks for the region, which is even where the name \u201cMacedonia\u201d comes from, and instead pushing and stretching the geographic borders of what the Roman province by that name was, was being used extensively as an argument, and is still being pushed. That\u2019s the first gambit. The second gambit required forging a belief that Macedonians were not Greeks. Which is as idiotic as saying that Spartans or Athenians are not Greeks (in this case idiotic is academically sound, with severity, because Nazi propaganda is that stupid and audacious, you know like claiming that Jews were evil and need to be eradicated because Nazi interests, and that Macedonians were not Greeks because Nazi interests \u2014 that sort of stupid). However, it worked. It worked mainly for four reasons. One is because the population was comprised of nearly totally uneducated peasants. Many were, in fact, of Greek descent, or had some Greek blood in previous generations, but were now slavic-speaking. About half were Albanians, also slavic-speaking. And many others were Bulgarians. This made it easier to leverage and ride the the wave of the population then being driven to re-unite with their own nations, but especially that part of the populace wanting to unite with Greece, but offered them a unique identity, which could then quickly be re-directed into sovereignty. The ideological backing and leverage was contingent on the exchange of populations that had already taken place in the region. Riding the nationalist wave into particular directions is precisely what happened, as evident from the propaganda documents of 1940\u201344. Lack of education amidst the population simply compounded the frivolous nationalist propaganda. The second reason it worked is because the region was experiencing national centrifugal forces, with Albanians, Greeks, Bulgarians and Serbs wanting to splinter Vardarska into non-existence, which made it imperative to strengthen a national identity until then ravaged by communism. The third reason it worked is that communism was already mirroring Nazi Fascism in many ways in leveraging nationalism for its own ideological cause, which made it much easier to move in this national identity forging direction through the writings of communist ideology. The fourth reason are the Jews. Bulgaria had many Jews that Hitler wanted to see executed. Tzar Boris, a soft Nazi, really wanted to save the population to build roads instead of turning them to soap. Just think about that for a second. Vardarska had a massive population of gypsies. Hitler wanted to bring in the Bulgarian \u201cclean Aryan nation\u201d to assume the Macedonian identity, but did not want the gypsies and the Jews, so he had to get Boris on his side to use the Jews as a means to push the gypsies out of Vardarska\u2026 This is one of the saddest parts of Bulgarian history. In other words, this national forging propaganda was fervent and continued until about 1944, curiously with both German money and influence, and Russian money and influence. The very curious thing is that both sides, Nazi-Fascist Germany and Fascist-Soviet Communist Russia, pushed for a Macedonian identity in the Vardarskan province of Yugoslavia , but in support of their own interests, and played a proxy war through the Vardarskan population\u2019s identity. On the one hand, Germany wanted to continue Hitler\u2019s plans for the geostrategic military interests in the region to have access to the Aegean. On the other hand, Russia had fears of Bulgaria siding with Hitler, and was trying to win over Yugoslavia, but the relationship with Yugoslavia was fragile, as Hitler had already engaged the southern population of the Vardarska Province of Yugoslavia into the nationalist identity construction of \u201cMacedonia\u201d. So the Russians would do well not to infringe on that sensitive national identity experiment, or they would risk losing influence if it backfired. Instead, they went along with it, but pushed for it on brother-to-brother terms, i.e. arguing that they had same religion, same language, but flattered the Vardarskan Yugoslavians as being \u201ctrue Macedonians\u201d who could, and should, fight like Alexander on the side of Russia. Effectively, the Russian influence argument was more like \u201cyes, sure, be Macedonian, but do so with us on your side, your Russian brothers, not the Germans\u201d. Inebriated by drunken glory they never had, the people of Vardarska bought the idea from both influencing powers, again and again; and again. After the collapse of Hitler, Tito did not give up on the idea of forging a \u201cMacedonia\u201d to the south that annexed Greek land into the Aegean, but remained part of Yugoslavia, and neither had Boris in Bulgaria (who had luckily died of a heart-attack just before Hitler\u2019s collapse) and both their successors, all for their own reasons. The nationalist wave in this newfangled Nazi-crafted identity gave politicians in Yugoslavia and Bulgaria the power to impel political clout, but also enabled recoiling and rallying of the populace into a common cause, amidst some rather precarious times. This was compounded into strength by communist interests in the region that also wanted to see powerful slavic-speaking nations find access to the Aegean, instead of Bulgaria\u2019s mere slither to the black sea. This scheming, however, had created a very serious problem: It was forgery of history, and the population was literally the ridicule of the educated world. It really was a joke that they even argued they were \u201cMacedonians\u201d - sort of like British fervently arguing they are descendants of the ancient Chinese, or that they stubbornly wanted to be called \u201cNorthern France\u201d and descendants of \u201cthe glorious Napoleon\u201d, or something that stupid. As a result, nearly everything in the Vardarskan educational system was forged, and remains very low in terms of academic integrity to this day. But as this national identity forgery ensued, when going outside their little country, it was like coming out of the false world of Disneyland into hard reality, so confusion and anger ran amok, feeling as though they were victims, the underdog fighting against the evil powers that be. And they were and are the underdogs fighting against the evil powers that be, except not as Macedonians \u2014 that was the identity forged for them by the evil powers that be, in order to serve their own interests. Coming to terms with this very hard reality, was not easy, and still remains very difficult. One lie brought another, and another and another. They have created a very elaborate network of lies, half truths, historical information distortions and rationalization gambits to weasel out of any argument. Vardarska came to be known as the capital of fake news under its new name \u201cFYRO\u00ab\u039c\u00bb\u201d. They gradually managed to deceive themselves into believing they hold an ethnic identity that is really not theirs. Then came the collapse of Yugoslavia. This resulted in Vardarska officially taking the name \u201cFYROM\u201d (former Yugoslav Republic, euphemistically adding \u201cMakedonija\u201d to it) and scratching the name Vardarska that could until then easily be found in many documents around the country. The population was literally living in the wake of decades of identity forging, and wanted to assume its foretold identity as \u201cMakedonijans\u201d. The Greek politicians, in turn, were completely incompetent, and granted, perhaps even traitors by Greek standards, in handling the issue. Ideally for the Greeks (and maybe for the region, too), they should have waged war in the 80s or 90s using only a few police units and leveled Vardarska to the ground, then splitting it between Albania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece \u2014 Greece only annexing parts up to Ohrid, which is traditionally as far as Macedonia really stretched, with Albania and Bulgaria taking the middle sections to the west and east, respectively, and Serbia annexing the northern part of Vardarska. And that would have been the end of the mess. Declassified documents under Samaras and Mitsotakis reveal such discussions and concessions may have taken place with the leaders in Albania, but did not go pan out, because by then Bulgaria had an interest in utilizing the situation by rendering Vardarska into a satellite state. After all, Vardarskans speak a mutually understandable Bulgarian dialect, and most of them were applying for Bulgarian passports, so why even fight for it, if Bulgaria could have it all? Albania on the other hand had a great interest in splitting it because nearly half of the population consisted of ethnic Albanians, even to this day. Serbia, on the other hand was crumbling. After this opportunity was lost to have four nations around Vardarska share it and split it apart, the Greeks simply handled the matter horribly for their own national interests. A lot has to do with communist ideology influence within Greece, but also total political incompetence in handling the matter. Then came the Greek crisis, which inevitably made Greece a German slap-servant to bid the interests of Merkel and her own political posse, eventuating with the Prespes Agreement signed by a communist party leader serving Merkel. If History has irony and repeats itself, perhaps this is a case in point, with Germany arguably enacting a fourth Reich using economic bullets, and Communist influence coming in to aid for its own interests in continuing the plan to forge a sovereign nation in that region, with supposed \u201cun-redeemed lands currently under Greek occupation to be liberated\u201d for the long dreamt glorious access to the Aegean. The bottom line is that up until the mid-2000s, this fake identity had been the product of an artificially constructed Nazi Fascist propaganda, and paradoxically aided simultaneously by Russian-Soviet communism, its first cousin. NATO, however, and a modern Germany especially, now the key powers, had similar geopolitical interests due to military and energy needs in the region. This is not to say that NATO and Germany bear any connection to Nazi and Russo-communist Soviet ideology. However, the reason why the plan is the same, is because the interests are the same, but the players are different. In more recent years, therefore, the issue could have been resolved very differently. In the 2000s and early 2010s, Vardarska was seeing international pressures to resolve its nameless circumstances. The name FYRO\u201dM\u201d was temporary after the dissolution of Yugoslavia, and if the former Yugoslavian province by the name Vardarska now as its own country was going to remain as a sovereign country, it needed to be recognized as a country with a proper name. There were opportunities for Vardarska to fall back on its original name \u201cVardarska\u201d, and get on with it, and enjoy life. However, some new players had interest in furthering the old Nazi-initiated plan and Russo-Communist strategy: NATO and Germany. Again, this is not to say that NATO and Germany bear any connection to Nazi and Russo-communist Soviet ideology, but rather that having assumed the leading role of influence in the region, the geopolitical and economic importance of the region call for leveraging in similar ways. That this is unethical, is another question. More specifically, NATO had established camp Bondsteel in the northern parts of Vardarska (then FYRO\u201dM\u201d), which had turned to be one of its largest military bases in the world. It needed to completely rip out any Russian influence in the region, but could not have the population shatter into splinters. It needed stability. The USA and NATO allies could not care less what the region decided to be called, but it needed a name, any name, and quickly, in order to make it a NATO ally. Yet the \u201cMacedonian\u201d wave of national rallying does pose strong leverage\u2026so pushing it forward does have benefits and advantages, similar to those recognized by Tito, Boris and Hitler. The region\u2019s geopolitical and military importance had not changed, and remains the same to this day. Germany, on the other hand, also wanted to see a puppet state being created, with the potential to help it in the future to annex Greek soil, because energy and trade avenues through rivers and roads from the Aegean through to Berlin can be explored massively. No wonder Merkel came for a surprise visit to see Tsipras just one day before he went to sign the Prespes agreement with FYRO\u201dM\u201d. She did it out of the goodness of her heart, and because it was directly pertinent to German interests. Where this brings us today: The country created out of Vardarska (FYRO\u201dM\u201d) based on the 2019 treaty using the name \u201cNorthern Makedonija\u201d now also uses the name \u201cMacedonia\u201d freely, merely based on geographic grounds. However, they have no relationship whatsoever to Greeks, nor the Greek tribe of the Macedonians, not even remotely, just as they have no connection to Spartans, Athenians and Thessalians, and any other Greeks. Most westerners could not be bothered to know history more than they know what to order at McDonald\u2019s, and invariably think that since \u201cMacedonia\u201d, for short, is a country, then it must follow that \u201cMacedonia cannot be [part of] Greece\u201d. The problem now becomes an issue of semantics. Never mind the fact that Macedonia has been the name of a Greek prefecture, encompassing nearly 90 per cent of what the real geographic Macedonia was and is, and is and was a Greek historical and geographical region. What makes things worse is that it is made to appear as though Greeks are the ones wanting to steal the \u201cMacedonian identity\u201d from the poor \u201cmadedonijans\u201d. The entire situation is like a CIA-orchestrated farce. The problem becomes an economic-trade one, too. With Northern Makedonija now using \u201cmacedonia\u201d freely on its products, traditional Greek products that had until now carried the region-specific designation \u201cMacedonia\u201d puts Greek businesses located in the Greek prefecture of Macedonia (the real one) in tatters. The entire thing is a geographic designation mess. What has happened to the Vardarskan Slavs is truly sad. They are the most used people in the geopolitical chess game for over one hundred years. They have been used and lied to by their own Yugoslavian government with Tito\u2019s dictatorial Fascism, by Bulgarian Nazi propaganda through Boris, and have been the victim of Hitler\u2019s own Nazi-Fascist interests for the region in collusion with Boris and Tito. They have also been victim to the Russo-communist Soviet interests, equally pushing for this identity forge, and have then also been victim to NATO\u2019s and Germany\u2019s interests further riding this farce to serve their own geopolitical interests. It\u2019s a clown kangaroo festival of national identity forging. That\u2019s the only real academic conclusion. Historically, there is not a shard of doubt that Former Vardarska of Yugoslavia, a.k.a. \u201cNorthern makedonija\u201d, has absolutely nothing to do whatsoever not only with the actual region Macedonia, but also Alexander and the Hellenistic Kingdoms. So, coming full circle to your question after exploring its root cause which remained unanswered by everyone else on the thread: it goes without saying that Alexander was most certainly Greek, Hellenic to be exact. (The name \u201cGreek\u201d was ushered in by Romans). There is not a single argument against Alexander not being Greek. Being Macedonian at the time of Alexander was simply being another Greek tribe, akin to being Spartan, Athenian, Theban, Corinthian, Syracusan, Rhodian, Cretan, Ionian, etc. Greeks had regionally-specific tribes and localities. They each had their unique characteristics, politics and royal or aristocratic families. However, they all spoke the same language, worshiped the same gods, had more or less the same culture, practices, calendars, clothing, and religion; and even though they often fought against each other as war states, they banded against common enemies. Alexander\u2019s lineage comes from Argos, that is southern Greece. The information provided by others on this thread is more than enough to open the door to factual reality: Alexander the Macedonian was Greek, much like Leonidas the Spartan was Greek, much like Themistocles the Athenian was Greek, and so forth\u2026 I hope that helps elucidate the misunderstandings that gave rise to such a politically riddled question. I have met very few truly educated Vardarskans. However, those who have been educated, are terribly depressed. All three of them I have met. One Vardarskan professor I once encountered on a plane described their circumstances as \u201cwe [they] live in a perpetual identity crisis\u201d. he called himself \u201ca Yugoslavian in crisis\u201d. He acknowledged that for the longest time, he had been living in a lie and that reading books in the west was the most difficult internal battle for him in order to come to terms with this. Others are not so noble. About twenty years ago I had a classics professor of \u2018women in antiquity\u2019 who was from that region, and she was also pushing for the \u201cMacedonia is not Greek\u201d kind of argument, and I simply stood up to her and confronted her in class. Needless to say, her ego did not let the truth go forward. Unfortunately, she is still working \u201cteaching\u201d Classics, spreading her identity instead of true education by leveraging her position. Certainly, she had the power to lower my GPA, and she did, which was evil on her part, but then I was too young to tear her apart into academic shreds and obliterate her career. No one should have the right to use their position of power to spread identity politics against the truth. That is a cardinal sin in the academic world. Today\u2019s Vardarskans would have a very difficult time reading this thread. They would feel as if they were the Jews being denied their rightful \u201cMacedonian\u201d identity, but how they feel does not change facts. I feel great pity for how much they have been used on the political chessboard. They are the epitome of an identity crisis on a national scale, hence such questions coming forward by them and others who are caught in the messy misinformation of identity politics. If anything, this is the first \u201ctrans\u201d nation, literally. My own two cents: If these people want to be Greeks so bad, ergo \u201cMacedonians\u201d they can just merge into Greece and learn to speak Greek, and then they can rightfully call themselves Macedonian in the south of what used to be Vardarska. The north of what used to be Vardarska can be called Paeonia, and its population Paeones, if they really want to stretch ancient history to the limits of geographic insanity, but at least they can do so with some degree of accuracy. If you want to keep anything at all from this in summary, then keep this: Alexander was a Macedonian Greek, much like Leonidas was a Spartan Greek, and Themistocles was an Athenian Greek, and Archimedes a Syracusan Greek. It\u2019s that simple. No conspiracy, no convoluted rationalizations about it. This situation cannot keep going for long. It will implode. As the tiny country stabilizes and more of its people educate themselves, they will learn the truth. And then it will implode. It is a horrible feeling realizing you are not what you\u2019ve been told you are. In the words of that Vardarskan professor I had met on the plane \u201cIt\u2019s like discovering you had been adopted, and that you had lived all your life as someone\u2019s son or daughter, and that your parents never told you the truth even though they knew, but led you on.\u201d It\u2019s even worse, and more stomach churning, when you realize your entire identity was forged by Nazis to serve their own geopolitical and military and ideological interests, and many other powers are also riding on the wake of such forgery for their own geopolitical and military interests\u2026 So this answers the \u201cwhy\u201d this question was asked at all, instead of just answering the question itself, which is otherwise utterly moot.
