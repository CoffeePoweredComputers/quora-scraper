            "answer_text": "How could someone create a \"gap year\"-like camp for people going on leave from college?More formats for very smart students who continuously hang out with each other. I know that CTY and SET are examples of such programs, but CTY only lasts for a couple of weeks, and extremely smart students are still trapped inside their K-12 schools for far too long. A scaleable version of Stanford EPGY Online High School (starting in elementary school) would be ideal, and could change the world. Also, does CTY have to be so expensive? What if there was another program like it that spared the lectures, but which allowed very smart students to just learn from each other and mess around with each other? Let Kids Run Wild OnlineA way to merge and compare huge scientific datasets. Imagine if *all* GWAS or MRI datasets could all be pooled together. 90% of data from old scientific studies is lost. Can't we pool all GWAS studies into one giant database to detect new associations (and maybe strenghten/weaken others)?A way to incentivize scientists (especially biomedical ones) to put more of their data out in the open so they can be pooled with other datasets. See What grants require recipients to practice open science and put all their data in the open? In particular, more data could help us finally get closer to the step of trying to tie in large-scale statistical studies (especially ones with SNPs) with the mechanistic small-scale effects that these SNPs have on cells/functionReinventing Discovery: The New Era of Networked ScienceHow feasible would it be to create a web application/online encyclopedia for doing meta-studies (and allowing people to visualize them)?How common is it for scientists (in general) to upload their datasets to sites like Kaggle to help crowdsource analysis of their data?Searching for Meaningful Biomarkers of Agingsome auto-ontogeny generator that recognizes an ontology I've created of my own tree of knowledge, and then suggests where new stimuli/webpages/memes I encounter can most nearly fit on top of that ontology to make my \"tree of knowledge\" more robustan online application that allows you to input your own datasets into online programs that can then display/analyze the data for you (preferably an online application that is able to take inputs from a variety of sources). I think this can really be the future of scientific visualization. But scientists have limited time. The main problem with many visualizations is that many scientists are slow to adopt them since it's inconvenient for them to switch.Standardization of scientific visualization programs (we want to avoid building things  from scratch as much as possible)Community centers or other public spaces where residents can meet, learn skills, bond around sports or crafts, and socialize. Libraries and cafes don't seem quite adequate.A scanner that auto-turns pages (from notebooks) and scans them in (preferably with an OCR feature)An OCR scanner that automatically scans all your image and PDF files, and converts the characters in the images into text (so that you can use search+copy/paste on them)Using Speech Recognition to Automatically Transcribe Interviews, Meetings, and Speeches (also see Page on reddit.com ) Image files that allow you to copy/paste text in them (so they can be searchable). Of course, by \"searchable\" I initially mean text, but I also mean semantic-based search too. It's even possible that you might be able to extract semantic data out of color data (red, for example, is somehow associated with love more often than other colors are)Semantic-based search for Google Desktop. Also, a Google Desktop that makes it easier to organize your files.Lee Hood's \"100K\" Long-Term Health Study Spins Out Startup | Xconomy (but more than that - with personalized real-time transcriptome analysis so that one can track the effects of a given intervention on one's rate of aging)some feature in Google Books where you're allowed to go to any page so that you can hyperlink people to it. The main issue is payment, and we're probably going to have to devise a radically different payment system where we're paying people to incentivize them to produce more (and no more than that). Academics, in particular, have citations as their currency (rather than money - beyond a basic salary anyways), so their books can be more easily digitized without protest (or a loss of publication incentive). Also, more people posting their book content online. Book content is best when it's easily shared+copied+pasted.Course websites that transfer over from one class to the next class. There's too much reinvention of the wheel in academia. Enhanced search systems will make plagiarism harder. It may be that there are an potential infinitude of problems to work on within each field (combinatorial growth - see my post about \"will we ever run out of human knowledge\"). In the long run, MOOCs may be even more useful than traditional courses as it's easy to reference past content from MOOCs, while it's much harder to reference it from courses in meat-lifeToxicome analysisSoftware that allows you to extract text from movie and sound files (maybe preferably, a new audio format that allows you to use search+copy/paste on them). I know that TED videos now have transcripts that are displayed along with themContinuous blood glucose monitoring (the best way to save on health-care costs, in fact, should come with personal data monitors)Easy way to select a bunch of Gmail email threads, and then to save them all as text (I'm sure there is a way to do it via Thunderbird, but it's clunky especially since Thunderbird is VERY laggy when you have a massive inbox)Easy way to transfer non-Gmail emails into a Gmail inboxA program that does Sentiment Analysis out of all your saved filesEvernote that allows other people to edit your notes. Maybe you could use Google Docs (and I'm sure there is an offline client for it). I should try that. Somehow, I prefer the Quora interface a lot more - but this could be non-objective bias. My favorite thing with Quora is that it autoconverts Quora URLs to include their title data. But Quora doesn't allow rich-text copy-paste of a lot of data (especially hyperlinks displayed as text rather than as URLs).What is the closest thing to Github for scientific computing?dx.doi for online news articles - see How do I maximize the chances that the URLs I use to cite news articles won't die several years from now? (many of Wikipedia's references now point to dead links). Link Rot: How can someone on Quora mass-archive all the external links they reference on their Quora answers, so content on their Quora answers doesn't suffer from link rot? A scraper needs to also exist for links on reddit.a new archive.org that can index Ajax-based links (heavy Ajax usage is the ruin of archive.org). And a new httrack that can do it as well (it may come out of ruby-based crawlers this time)a mood sensor that shows when someone might be annoyed at some times, and when someone might be ready to chat in others (many are more likely to get annoyed by requests when they're in the middle of coding something - people might then be able to see that they might not be as responsive as they normally am when that happens). something that integrates the best features of Quora, Reddit, vBulletin, Wordpress, Drupal, and InvisionBoard. Especially one that autosuggests similar posts as you type in new questions/threads(hopefully one that is eventually semantically-based) and that doesn't make old posts so hard to view (although ironically, this makes necrothreading less frowned upon in Quora - necrothreading is extremely important when it comes to threads that meet the needs of the long tail)When will Google be able to use voice recognition algorithms to someday list the words in YouTube videos along with its main search results?How far away is Google from being able to use OCR algorithms to scan the text embedded in images so that it can also be listed under the main search results of a Google search?a mouseover application that works with all browsers, PDFs, and text  files - which allows you to quickly see the definition of an unfamiliar  term (it would also be nice if someone could integrate footnote data  into mouseover data). The main thing, though, is that something has to  make it convenient for an author to consistently use a footnote to  explain the same term across multiple documents (say, if the author has  to use a technical term like \"ad hoc\" in many of his documents, and has a  unique use of it that isn't found in the dictionary, then maybe suggest  a \"footnote autosuggest\" so that he won't have to manually insert the  footnote each time?)a generalization of this could come in the form of augmented reality (see PredictionBook:  By 2030, there will be commercial and/or free applications/overlays  that will present the user with lie/truth probabilities of a talking  person - useful e.g. for politicians in TV debates. It could be video  analysis, augmented reality overlays or somethingResearch/Other things I'd like to see: Research on time as a fundamental resource (rather than money). in an age of digital abundance, time is the limiting resource, rather than money - and we may see more instances like the Georgetown student paying someone to do his chores (also Are there any startups that could help address our unemployment issues at scale (i.e., need a lot of labor)?). Also see Yishan Wong's answer to What are some important and generalizable life lessons?, and also the below point on modafinil. So for one thing, investigate more of Gregory Rader's economics of value (see What happens when we start producing more \"important\" media than an individual can consume?, If energy was free and renewable, how would the economy be fundamentally different from what it is now?, and What are the most understudied areas of economics, in relation to research output from academia and think-tanks?)Some research study that can finally identify whether or not sleep-deprivation induced by modafinil can lead to amyloid-beta buildup (time is the primary limiting resource, and some use modafinil to contribute more. And find if there is a way to slow down this amyloid-beta buildupA massive study for comparing the sizes of the somatosensory, motor, and prefrontal cortices - for each and every vertebrate in the animal kingdom (so that we can develop a measure that's better than the encephalization quotient). And also - testing to see if weight/height influence the size of somatosensory/motor/prefrontal cortices within peopleWhat keyboard shortcuts should Quora add?Some creative technology that can \"convert\" carbon dioxide into a carbon solid that can be trapped in the ground (I emphatically emphasize this - realistically speaking, we're not going to be able to do much about India and China)Some drug/treatment that can eliminate grudges (from the literature on school shooters, grudge-collecting is a major reason why people shootup their schools). And these grudges are also the same cause for a significant portion of conflicts and wars - as explained at . It's possible that radical transparency can identify things before theyhappen (as explained at http://lesswrong.com/lw/36p/individuals_angry_with_humanity_as_a_possible/), but it's quite possible that it might not happen. And this is going to be a major issue where possible treatments (surreptitious administration of oxytocin/serotonin agonists, genetic screening of those who have genetic variants predisposing them to antisocial personality disorder or grudge-collecting) may infringe upon liberty, but may also be theonly way for our civilization to survive through the next 100 years.What are some research studies on online trolling/vandalism? - we also have to realize that we shouldn't demonize rogue users who could become even more resentful. We just have to find a creative way to accommodate them without alienating anyone elseHow can we solve the problems with public education in America?Some way to cultivate more abundance mindsets in peopleForward-looking statistics (as explained in a recent book about the future of economics - http://www.thelightsinthetunnel.com/), statisticsis backwards looking, not forward looking (a major issue with econometrics rightnow). We're certainly not going to be able to predict a future Challenger/Columbia disaster by looking at data in the past (nor are we going to be able to totally anticipate the effects of novel genetic variants - which arise ALL the time in each individual person - see http://www.gnxp.com/wp/2011/08/03/welcome-to-your-genome/ ).

            "answer_text": "An instant learning machine, that allows us to instantly download information into our brains.Some device that will organize the internet and be able to communicate with a human user to filter the information interactively until the desired data is found. Pick a chore, any chore! If you find something that will remove it from our lists of things to do for an acceptable price you have an answer. A device capable of uploading information directly from the brain and downloading it as a message into another willing recipient's brain. Think of all the misunderstandings we would eliminate.Any synthetic replacement for any body part that we do not yet have the ability to create.Virtual reality. It goes further than just entertainment. Think of the modelling and control system possibilities. It can be used to pilot anthropomorphic exoskeletons and, when it comes to 3 dimensional interactions many things might be more easy to model if we could simply interact with them as we do with things in our environment, regardless of their actual scale.Better beds! I don't know about you, but for me beds could use a major makeover. If you lie face down you either smother yourself or twist your neck. If you lie face up, snoring and light are an issue (plus I get a back ache). If you lie sideways your arm falls asleep. Pick any super material and find a way to make it cheaper/better/more reliably. Examples, graphene, and carbon nanotubes.A method of defying gravity without the input of energy. To be more specific a way to fix things in \"vertical\" space just as we do on the surface of the earth. This applies to the elevator to space as well as to optimizing our space on earth.Any device that can effectively render nuclear weapons useless worldwide. There is a condition to this one however. It would only be beneficial to the world as a whole if it is only able to disable every single nuclear weapon around the world simultaneously, and permanently.Weather control devices that passively divert weather. If we could isolate a given section of the world from wind we could build giant buoyant platforms which we could use to reduce the distance to space, and thus aid in the concept of the elevator to space.Anything that improves our perception and measurement of reality. Think telescope, microscope, spectroscope. Nothing hastens the development of science and technology quite like instruments of measurement.Anything that allows us to protect ourselves from a danger from space, such as asteroids. Currently we are virtually defenseless.A one size fits all cure for disease. Up till now the only way to combat disease has depended on the disease of interest. Imagine we find a way to mass manufacture synthetic immune systems. Especially something like nanobots that are immune to damage from the pathogen. Such an invention would face countless challenges, such as how to prevent the real immune system from responding to it. But if we came up with something like that we might actually find a way to repair any ailment and actually save on resources that are required to find an infinity of different cures to different diseases.",
