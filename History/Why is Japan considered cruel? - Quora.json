            "answer_text": "Which side of Japan are you looking at? Japan has had a lot of changes. It\u2019s practically a whole new country every few decades. I\u2019ll skip Nanking and Unit 731 because we know how shitty it is, and because I don\u2019t have any specific conclusion or information to it either, so I won\u2019t talk about it. I\u2019ll instead move right over to what is really cruel about Japan: black company. Get all these words, combine them, and make up a story: extended work hours. Power harassment. Withholding of salary. Even more work hours. Sexual harassment. Academic harassment. Suicide. In Japan, corporate employees are expected to go home only after their superiors. If their boss doesn\u2019t go home? You can stay until he leaves. You also don\u2019t have much liberty when it comes to vacation days. You sure have them by law, but it is not nice because it affects your bonus. Oops. Anyway, just think that they don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s easier that way. Take a break during Golden Week and (if your company is kind enough) Obon week, like the others do, and cram yourself in a resort full of snotty children and disturbing old men, or something. (It\u2019s partly why I hate going on vacations in Japan.) No, you can\u2019t trade holidays. We don\u2019t work on holidays, so you can\u2019t. Just go, have fun on Golden Week. A woman worked at NHK, the national broadcaster of Japan (similar functional level to BBC). 159 hours of overtime. Dead. Everything has been at the extreme point, to the point that there is a company specializing in attempting to fix this problem. Taking workplace bullying in Japan by the horns with power harassment prevention education | The Japan Times Your work doesn\u2019t work because it\u2019s biological and stuff that can\u2019t always be controlled? EXCUSES! YOU ARE NOT TRYING HARD ENOUGH! STAY LONGER! WORRRRKKKKKKK! ",
