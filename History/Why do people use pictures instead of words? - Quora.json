            "answer_text": "Assuming you mean \u201cpicture text\u201d instead of just plain text; Advantages of \u201cPicture Text\u201d over simple text It (the text) cannot be edited by a third party.Metadata such as Exchangeable image file format (EXIF) or Extensible metadata platform (XMP) for information about the author, subject, copyright, date, et al, can be embedded in a picture but not visible to the viewer.It can be made pretty with colour, word size, and word placement for emphasis, etc.Its layout does not change for different media/screen sizes.Disadvantages of \u201cPicture Text\u201d over simple text It cannot be edited/updated when things change.It cannot be indexed.EXIF and XMP information can be altered or stripped (as Facebook does with all uploaded images anyway).It does not resize/wrap well on different screen sizes/media.It cannot be resized, have contrast increased, nor converted to braille/speech for the disabled.Uses more bytes for storage.Alternatives A standard markup or Rich text document such as hypertext markup language (HTML) with cascading stylesheets (CSS), open document format (ODF), or portable document format (PDF). An image type such as a scalable vector graphic (SVG) can also be used. All can be edited by third party.All can be protected from accidental edits.All can be indexed.All can contain metadata.All can have \u201cpretty printing\u201d.All can have fixed layout.All can have text reflow/wrap for certain media.All can be resized, have contrast increased, or converted to braille/speech for the disabled.HTML/CSS and ODF resize/wrap well on different screen sizes/media with little formatting loss (although ODP can lose some additional formatting when that is done). PDF and SVG text tends to lose all formatting when text is resized/wrapped for viewing on different size media.They all use more bytes than simple text but significantly less than typical \u201cPicture Text\u201d.",

            "answer_text": "A single picture can very easily illustrate and explain something that can be very difficult to express in words. Pictures also have no language barriers, this is why manufacturers have gone from printing assembly instructions in several languages, to showing the assembly steps in pictures. Even when you are using just text to explain something, having an image with it adds visual interest and breaks up a wall of text to make it easier to read. ",
