            "answer_text": "Azerbaijan does not really exist. It is a leftover of the Ottoman Imperial Annexation of Armenia and the subsequent Pogrom Genocide. Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iraq and Syria all contain bits of the historical Armenian Homelands. The Kurds are a southern population that has remained in these areas despite heavy outside interference. Much like the Native American of North and South America the Modern Armenian diaspora is a heavily persecuted population. Both Turkey and Iran have made overtures toward domination of the region for different reasons. While Iran has historically protected Armenia, the Turks have repeatedly tried to perpetuate full scale ethnic genocide against Armenia. The modern country of Azerbaijan is just a proxy state for Arab and Turkish influence. Russia has repeatedly backed Armenia due to ethnic ties. The Armenian language uses a unique script, to write a very ancient language. Yerevan, the Capitol of Armenia has been continuously occupied by an unbroken line of local leaders for over 7000 years. The historic Armenian nation interacted with Ancient Egypt, Babylon, Jerusalem, Rome, the Sassanids, the Achaemenids, and others. Frequently Armenia has joined larger nations in Treaty to guarantee protection of their land. This tactic worked against them during the Ottoman period however. Even though Armenia has survived, countries like Turkey Chechnya and Azerbaijan now occupy the majority of the Ethnic Armenian Highlands. Azerbaijan specifically, is a remnant of the splinter Aziri Empire which spared between the Persians and ottomans with backing from Cairo. These slave traders built an Empire upon the backs or the kidnapped souls whom they stole away. Large portions of the countryside were emptied by Ottoman slave raiders to fill up cities with labor forces. Today there has been no apology, and instead Turkey continues to make aggressive overtures and deny the Genocide of Armenians occurred. Azerbaijan acts a puppet state for Neo Ottoman interests, and jumps at every word Erdogan spews. This arrangement is quite cozy, but even Iran is fed up. The land that Azerbaijani Nationalists currently occupy is owned entirely by the people of Armenia. If Azerbaijan does not give up Nagorno Karabak, they will be forced through military action to give up the entire country and leave as refugees. The entire population will either be deported or worse. Armenia would love to return the favor, and they have been patiently making treaties with every powerful country. The fact is that Armenia has the full confidence of the US and UN , even Russia and Iran. Azerbaijan has always been a problematic splinter state with dubious loyalties and questionable ties to South Western African Radicals. If the UN were to finally end Azerbaijan I believe a collective sigh of relief would go up, even among Islamic countries. ",

            "answer_text": "As any country, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (Artsakh) belongs to its people, not to its neighboring nations. Artsakh people are ethnic Armenians who declared their Independence in 1991, upon collapse of the Soviet empire. They live independent and sovereign in their democratic country for many decades. Why should the Artsakh people let their country to be divided? Just because of the hostile anti-Karabakh claims by the neighboring Azerbaijan? Would you agree yourself to divide your country just because of the claims by any hostile neighbor country? No country will remain in the world if they would divide upon each aggressive claim by neighbors. ",
