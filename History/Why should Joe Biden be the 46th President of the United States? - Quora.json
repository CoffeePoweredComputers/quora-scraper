            "answer_text": "Why? He will not.Why would anyone with a brain want to vote for a brainless pervert in the first place. I get it. Voters wanted a first woman president. Yeah, it is exciting, the first of anything is exciting.Voters saw Hilary put Top secret info on her private server, should have faced a judge and fined a gone to jail.Butt she did not. Okay i get it, Voters hated Trump and voted for crooked Hilary. Now,what I do not understand is how can voters say they support this Biden? He has had woman problems in his long career. That is why he must pick a black woman to stand besides him. A woman to show females it is alright, this pervert is under control and hey look I am a female and I am his running mate. A black person , a female to show black people it is alright when and if they as voters read Biden*s record on busing when he was in the senate. Hey,I understand this . Question Where is Joey? Do you know know where Joey Biden is. Well I guess he is in his home. Question, Doing what? He is running for president, okay but why he home?: Making meals with his wife? Cleaning his room? My answer is Joey Biden is HIDING? I know you Biden fools will say he is staying away from the virus, I say wear a mask. Have your wife show you how to put it on your face. Get out of your home and act like a serious person who is running for president. The Biden people who are helping Joey get to the white house, will not tell you this. But I will.They want him home. They want him to keep his mouth shut, until the convention, then a speech writer will have Joey read a well written speech and pray that he can read it without messing it up. The Biden voter fools will write me like in the past and tell me what did he say that was so bad. Well Joey mistook his wife for his sister, I saw the clip,his wife looked sad but she is a pro and forced a smile, hey guys you ever that?You ever look at your sister or family member and think it is your wife, if yes why? Joey was in a state to address a audience with a written speech he was to read. He guessed the wrong state. I saw the clip, I thought it was funny. But all you Biden fools that are thinking of voting for Joey, this is a person you want to be voting for president someone who God forbid may use the codes to drop an atomic weapon on a nation,someone who mistook his sister for his wife, you think that is funny, you laughing, be honest I can not see you, you think it is alright. In ending,You Joey Biden fools think it is alright for 8 years Joey Biden as VICE PRESIDENT touched smelled hugged felt up female young too, Do not tell me about Trump, Trump neverdid this stuff to women IN THE WHITE HOUSE as president on tape but Joey did, you find tapes on our president go find these tapes, I did. Biden as VP bothered these woman while they were guests in the white house, on tape, you are thinking of voting for that. Some of those females were young, hey that is a felony I guess some of you smarts ones knew that. President Trump has faults he is not perfect, are you? I am a Trump supporter, Trump will be reelected 4 more years.God bless President Trump, God bless our very brave Veterans, who I want the vets to know I always stood for our flag and I always will, And God bless the United States of America.

            "answer_text": "Its very likely he would be a very good to great president. The reasoning is simple. The biggest is he has a excellent track record. Lots of experience and lots of success. He has been a senator for a very long time, since the 70s I believe. He was obviously Obama's vice president and he was excellent in that role. He was the number two man in a incredibly successful administration. From having a part in winning two big elections to the strategy and speaches to just being well respected in general. One of the Obama administration's greatest dynamics was overall quality of staff and advisors even down to lower levels. Most people only think of the bigger positions but for a US president to be successful they would need expertise of Everything. With Trump you have to think what mental hospital did he get these idiots. His people are the most asinine fools you could find. I mean you have an american president saying injecting your self with bleach is a viable solution for coronavirus. That explains a lot. Anyway I didn't mean to go on a tangent but biden will replicate certain aspects of Obama's presidency and that is one of them. I mean look at his vice president pick. Kamala harris is sharp as a tack, has a lot of relevant experience, and from a age standpoint is perfect to replace him if needed. That's another point if the age of biden becomes impossible he will simply retire and let Harris take the helm. So anyway he has good people around him, a excellent track record, a viable plan forward, respect the world over. But he has one more thing : he is not Trump. Imagine the joy in London and Paris, and the missery in Moscow and beijing to learn America has returned to it's former golry. Imagine Putin sitting in his office in Moscow realizing that his plan to avenge the loss of his beloved Soviet Union has failed. Imagine the Chinese communist party realizeing that they will not surpass the united states as the world's largest economy. Imagine America being made great once again, compared to our past 4 years of failure and embarrassment. Just by winning he will be loved by the free world, that is enough to have a successful presidency on its own. ",
