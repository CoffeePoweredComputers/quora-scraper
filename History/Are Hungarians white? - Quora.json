            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s put this question into terminological perspective: In contemporary word usage you must differentiate between WHITE and CAUCASIAN. I take Caucasian as the more scientific term: it was defined at the late 18th century based on anthropometrical data (mostly skeletal measurements). It includes every so called \u201cEuropid\u201d people i.e. all Europeans plus Middle-Eastern, North-African and Central-Asian people (with Northern India being the Easternmost). They are differentiated from \u201cMongoloid\u201d and \u201cCongoid/Negrid\u201d \u201cracial\u201d groups based on their characteristic facial features (long face, prominent brow and vertical forehead, long, narrow nose and high nasal bridge) and some other morphological attributes (medium to tall height, mostly straight or wavy hair texture, hair color ranging from reddish blonde to black, very light to fairly tanned skin tone). In THIS sense it can be 100% surely stated that Hungarians are ALL Europid/Caucasian. (With he exception of a few Asian or African immigrants and their descendants.) Note: And this includes gypsies as well due to them being of Indian origin. From the above it is evident that this Caucasian group is quite heterogeneous and diverse: it includes paler \u201cNordic\u201d and darker \u201cBalkanic/Mediterranean\u201d people as well. In Hungary both of these are quite common and entirely natural (though on personal perception Id say that the darker element is probably more common). Some pics of prominent Hungarians to illustrate this diversity:        Let this be enough! :) Now the thing with WHITE: If you mean white as equivalent with Caucasian then the answer is the same as above. BUT my perception is that the term \u201cwhite\u201d as used in modern Anglophone context has a stricter meaning. As english-speaking countries have a white population mostly of Nordic/Germanic origin (plus are major destinations of non-European immigration) the racial discourse in these states is in my opinion quite peculiar and cannot (should not) be taken as a model for other European countries. In Britain police codes still make a difference between IC1 and IC2 individuals which signifies Nordic and Mediterranean respectively (Prince Harry and David Beckham are the former, George Clooney or Sean Connery the latter). In the US its not only \u201cMuslims\u201d (i.e. Middle-Eastern and Indian \u201cbrown\u201d people) who are excluded form whiteness, but also Hispanics/Latinos (and sometimes even Italians, Greeks and other Southern-European people). The idea that Shakira and JLo are \u201cwomen of color\u201d is laughable at best for me\u2026 Thus in American usage \u201cwhite\u201d frequently tends to mean the traditionally dominant Germanic element (English/British, German). In this sense a significant part of Hungarians may not be counted as \u201cwhite\u201d but some other more \u201cegzotic\u201d ethnicity. (But the same applies to the French, Spaniards, Italians, Balkanics and almost every European nation.) I dont have to mention how messed up this classification is in my opinion. ",

Some interesting findings of Hungarian experts: Today\u2019s Hungarian genes, by B. Cs\u00e1nyi, E. Bog\u00e1csi-Szab\u00f3, Gy. T\u00f6m\u00f6ry, \u00c1. Czibula, K. Priskin, A. Cs\u0151sz, B. Mende, P. Lang\u00f3, K. Csete, A. Zsolnai, E. K. Conant, C. S. Downes, and I. Rask\u00f3. \"Y-Chromosome Analysis of Ancient Hungarian and Two Modern Hungarian-Speaking Populations from the Carpathian Basin.\": \"The Hungarian population belongs linguistically to the Finno-Ugric branch of the Uralic family. The Tat C allele is an interesting marker in the Finno-Ugric context, distributed in all the Finno-Ugric-speaking populations, except for Hungarians. This question arises whether the ancestral Hungarians, who settled in the Carpathian Basin, harbored this polymorphism or not. 100 men from modern Hungary, 97 Szeklers (a Hungarian-speaking population from Transylvania), and 4 archaeologically Hungarian bone samples from the 10th century were studied for this polymorphism. Among the modern individuals, only one Szekler carries the Tat C allele, whereas out of the four skeletal remains, two possess the allele. The latter finding, even allowing for the low sample number, appears to indicate a Siberian lineage of the invading Hungarians, which later has largely disappeared. The two modern Hungarian-speaking populations, based on 22 Y-chromosomal binary markers, share similar components described for other Europeans, except for the presence of the haplogroup P*(xM173) in Szekler samples, which may reflect a Central Asian connection, and high frequency of haplogroup J in both Szeklers and Hungarians. MDS analysis based on haplogroup frequency values, confirms that modern Hungarian and Szekler populations are genetically closely related, and similar to populations from Central Europe and the Balkans.\" Then: \"The R1a1-M17 frequency in Hungarians (30%) and Szeklers (18.6%) is comparable to that in their neighbours (e.g. Czechs and Slovaks, mainland Croatians, Bosnians, Romanians, Serbians) and some other Uralic-speaking populations (e.g. Estonian, Komis, Mordvin)... Similar frequencies of R1b as in the Hungarian speakers are found in some Slavic populations (mainland Croatians, Slovenians, Poles, Bulgarians); and in some Uralic-speakers (Komis, Khanties, Mordvin) as well as in Romanian and Turkish populations... The presence of central-Asian haplogroup P*(xM173) in Szeklers is unusual for a European population, since it is almost absent in continental Europe... and presumably reflects some Asian contribution, before or after reaching Transylvania. Hg I-M170 is the only Y-chromosome haplogroup that is confined almost exclusively to the European continent... Haplogroup I was detected with almost equal frequency in the two modern populations: 24% in Hungarians and 21.7% in Szeklers. However, two of its major subclades- I1a-M253 and I1b*(xM26) - show an opposite occurrence in the two ethnic groups, 8% and 13%, respectively, in Hungarians, and 16.5% and 5.2% in Szeklers. These are within the range of normal central and eastern European values... The elevated frequency of Hg I1a together with higher frequency of R1b-M269 in Szekler population might be the consequence, at least in part, of the genetic impact of people of German origin, who settled in Transylvania from the 12th century onwards (Transylvanian Saxons)... In the present study haplogroup J was unexpectedly common in the Hungarian-speaking populations (Hungarians: 16%, Szeklers: 21.6%). Haplogroup J... is considered to have originated in the Middle East... The J1-M267 Y-chromosomal lineage is notably frequent in Szeklers (10.3%; a value far above the range for other central and eastern European populations..., while its frequency in Hungarians (3.0%) is unremarkable. ... Among these J2-M172 subclades, J2e1-M102 is more frequent in Szeklers (7.2%) than in Hungarians (4.0%), while the undifferentiated J2-M172* Y chromosomes are slightly more common in Hungarian population (8% vs. 3.1%). Both J2f*-M67 and J2f1-M92 lineages were detected in our study in one single individual, in each population. ... Haplogroup E3b-M35 occurs at 10% frequency in Hungarians and 9.2% in Szeklers with E3b1-M78 chromosomes accounting for almost all representatives (\u223c90%). Hg E is mainly African, but its clade E3b-M35 has also been observed in Europe... Both E3b-M35 and its derivative (E3b1-M78) probably originated in eastern Africa...\" The language does not represent the population genetics and origin by any means. It is the same for Serbs, Croats, Romanians, Bulgars, or Slovaks. They are all part of the same Getic tribes family of Illirian-Dacian-Thracian sort, that lived there for millenia. Let\u2019s see how we\u2019ve got to this conclusion. Conform Kurgan hypothesis, Indo-Europeans migrated in all directions from the Caucasus north region, especially between 4000 BC to 1000 BC. Two main directions were West, towards European continent and East, towards India of today:  The Western branch reached and settled in Central Europe, Carpathian basin and Balkans, by 2500 BC and in West Europe, by 1000 BC. Being at a cross-roads between East European steppes (Ukraine), Pontic area (Turkey and Balkans) , Baltics (Poland, Lithuania) and West Europe (Germany. Austria), Hungarian territory of today was a migration hub and melting pot of all Caucasians moving back and forth for around 3000 years (between 4000 BC and 1000 BC). If you look at the genetic map of Y-DNA (males, who travelled most) you may find all main European genes of today populations in Europe. Caucasians brought three main genetic groups to Europe: R1a, R1b and J2. West Europeans have as main gene R1b, Celtic. They are the Western branch of Indo-Europeans (Caucasians). Hungarians have similar (15\u201320%) R1b genes proportion to Scandinavians and Central Europeans (Sweden, West Poland, Austria, Czech, Romanians and Balkans):  East Europeans have more R1a, from the ancient Slavic people. Hungarians have similar proportion (15\u201320%) of R1a genes as Romanians, most of Balkans, German and Scandinavian people:  A very old marker in smaller proportion (8\u201315%) in Hungarian population is the J2 Y-Dna marker, present again in similar numbers in: Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, part of Sweden, Austria, Romania and Bulgaria. One fourth of the Vlach people (isolated communities of Romance language speakers in the Balkans) belong to J2, considerably more than the average of Macedonia and northern Greece where they live. Quite a few ancient Mediterranean and Middle Eastern civilizations flourished in territories where J2 lineages were preponderant. This is the case of the Hattians, the Hurrians, the Etruscans, the Minoans, the Greeks, the Phoenicians (and their Carthaginian offshoot). Interesting is the fact that the highest concentration (30\u201340%) of J2 marker is in Caucasus mountains:  Now, about the older populations of Europe before Kurgan (4500 BC). North Europeans have I1-I2, Scandinavian, Sardinian, Dalmatian are two close genetic groups representing ancient populations from the North and South of Europe before the Indo-Europeans. They are the ones Indo-Europeans kind of destroyed all over Europe, during migrations. They are in higher proportion on the extremes North (Scandinavia) and South (Sardinia) of Europe. I1 evolved in isolation in Scandinavia during the late Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods, when hunter-gatherers from southern Europe recolonised the northern half of the continent from their Last Glacial Maximum refugia. I1 (North) earlier people, Hungarians have low percentage (1\u20132%), similar to French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanians, etc.:  I2 (M438/P215/S31) is thought to have originated during the Late Paleolithic, around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which lasted approximately from 26,500 to 19,000 years ago. I2 probably appeared in western Europe, although its exact region of origin cannot be determined since Paleolithic Europeans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Haplogroup I2 is the most common paternal lineage in former Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria and Sardinia, with percentage of 15\u201320% also present in Austrians, Hungarians and Ukrainians:  South-Mediterranean Europeans have E1b1a1, of North African origin. They were early migrations of agricultural and cattle grower people coming through Anatolia, but original from North Africa. Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Etruscans had a strong E1b1b marker. Hungarians have similar proportion (10\u201315%) of E1b1b genes with most West Europeans (same as France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany), most Central Europeans (Czech, Serbia, Croatia, Romania, Austria) and Ukraine. This is less than South Balkan and South Italian people (they have more, which is normal):  On the mother side though, things are even more clear, as women traveled/migrated less in the past; J, U5, HV0, V and K markers (MtDNA) are dominant among Europeans and, again, Hungarians have the average percentages of all. Interesting is the 39.2\u201337.2% for H, 10.1\u201310.5% for J and 7.4\u20137.2% for U5, 6.9\u20137.9% for K markers that account for around 65% of European MtDNA genome, Hungarians and Romanians seem to be the closest. Distribution of haplogroup J (mtDNA) in Europe:  Distribution of haplogroup U5 (mtDNA) in Europe:  Distribution of haplogroup K (mtDNA) in Europe:  Distribution of haplogroups HV0 and V (mtDNA) in Europe:  It seems female markers are pretty similar all over the continent, with definitely fewer variations than the male ones. That seems logical, as women traveled and moved around very little compared to men, thousands of years ago. Most of those markers are ancient, long before Caucasian migrations; however, that does not mean that Caucasians did not bring similar female (MtDna) markers themselves. Whilst each area of Europe has only one, or two, main genetic groups, Hungary and surrounding countries have around 15\u201320% of each of the five main branches. You can find all those four branches in a fairly balanced proportion in today\u2019s Hungarian population. Similar genetic proportions exist in the neighbouring countries, such as Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Bulgaria. Slovakia and Ukraine have more R1a, which is normal (being more Slavic). Look at today\u2019s genetic map of Europe. It reflects the proto-European populations (I1, I2, E1b1) and the Caucasian invaders of 6400 years ago (R1a, R1b and J2), in over 95% proportion. Some exception is the N genes (Uralo-Finic-Siberian origin), mostly present in some Baltic states and Russia. That shows clearly that whatever migrations happened after 4400 BC were insignificant for population genetics of the Balkan region and Central Europe and account for less than 5% for all combined:  If we take the language element, Magyar language originates somewhere in Central Asia and certain phrase forms and even words have similarities with local languages spoken in North of Korean peninsula and even parts of Japan. Magyar people journey to Europe was a very long one and took centuries in time. Their population mixed with many other tribes they met on the way and it is very possible to already be a mixture when they reached the Pannonian planes in 800\u2019s AD. The language stayed, as spoken by the rulling class, but genetially they mixed and assimilated with Europeans for quite a while already. Magyars, that gave the language of the country, were mostly assimilated, living behind the language and the beautiful customs, as a reminder of a unique culture that once migrated there. Conclusion is that Hungarian population is a pretty balanced combination of all people that populate Europe today, very close to their neighbours, Austrians, Slovaks, Romanians and the Balkanic people (less the Greeks).

            "answer_text": "Yes. As G\u00e1bor Kertai has pointed out, the correct term for white people is Caucasian. But yes, Hungarians today are almost exclusively white. According to the 2011 census, some 83% of the population of Hungary is ethnic Hungarian. http://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xftp/idoszaki/nepsz2011/nepsz_orsz_2011.pdf Hungarians live in Hungary, (a little less than 10 million) and in a disapora, primarily in the surrounding countries, (Transylvania in Romania, Slovakia, Ukrain, Voivodina in Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia and Austria) and in other countries like the US, Australia and around the world. With the diaspora included, there are a little less than 15 million Hungarians in the world today. An originally Finno-Ugric people, Hungarians mixed with, and assimillated many other ethnicities. Aside from Germanic, Slavic and Turkic influence over the millenia, there have been non-Caucasian peoples too: During the High Middle Ages, for example, Cumans migrated and settled in the Kingdom of Hungary and the Mongols also left a distinct genetical mark. (Among others, blood type B) So there are some minor non-Caucasian genes in the gene pool of modern Hungarians. Also, as G\u00e1bor has mentioned, a considerable Roma/Gypsy minority lives in Hungary and Central Europe today. Aside from that, various people from around the world travel or live in Hungary, primarily Budapest, where like as in any other European metropolis, you can see people of various skin colors. So all in all, your average Hungarian will be a pale-skinned or maybe a slightly tan Caucasian of brown, blonde or rarely ginger hair, most likely with brown or blue eyes. ",

I know in the US they\u2019re not considered white. In Europe usually when we think in lay people\u2019s terms about being a race, you really just have the following: White, Black, Indian (as in, from India, though sometimes grouped with Asian), Asian, and Indian (I know, Native American, but in Hungary we call them indi\u00e1n, while people from India are indiai, so it\u2019s a different word). So anyone who\u2019s from Europe is white. The shades go from the really pearly white Northern people to the deep brown Greeks, but we still consider them all white. So when I first heard Americans distinguish Latinos, I was like \u201cwhat? they\u2019re white!\u201d So actually, your question doesn\u2019t make much sense. ",
