            "answer_text": "If we are to learn from our mistakes, history is essential. We rarely do, so therefore history is not useful. Homo Sapiens believes it is super intelligent! If so, perhaps it is about time it showed it, and stopped the headfirst plunge into extinction and prevented half the population of the planet from dying of hunger, lack of water and inability to survive through warfare, political destruction of our communities, our regions, our country and our planet by Total Toxic Overload killing millions of people through unjust inequality, essentially caused by greed of a few, who are now the plutocrats who dominate governments. Destroying any semblance of democracy, and using the people as cattle fodder compliant consumers to exploit their unsustainable products and services. The global economy is bankrupt and history has provided us with an explanation as to why this has happened. We ignore history because we have been indoctrinated and manipulated by fabricated propaganda by governments and by the few that control them for their own self enrichment and self aggrandizement to lie and mislead us that everything they do is for the benefit of the people. In fact, the people as far as they are concerned, are only good for making them richer in return for making everything else including human rights, poorer. It is essential that we look back on history and see where we have gone wrong and been misled by weak and self interested politicians. Will we have the perspicacity to do this? Probably not, and we shall allow corruption injustice, inequality, poverty, deprivation, immigration through war and destitution to continue. Because of all our greed and selfishness, not to change but to go on accepting the status quo. Most of all we will continue to allow our planet to die of pollution. ",

            "answer_text": "People who think that history is not useful based their argument on two things, the fact that history written by the winners or the ones who are in power, and circumstances changed, which is true to an extent. However, if we understand the circumstances knowing how they change we will have better idea how things really are, we can complete the puzzle and see the big image as crystal clear; therefore, reading, knowing, understanding history is essential, it explains how things become the way they are right today, and gives directions how to move forward.
