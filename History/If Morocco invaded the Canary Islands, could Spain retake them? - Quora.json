            "answer_text": "I believe so. Taking the Canary Islands alone would be highly difficult for Morocco - with 4 landing ships available in its navy, it could at best deploy perhaps four infantry companies it would be a practically impossible task of defeating the defence forces including: 20 F/A-18 Hornets1 Light Infantry Brigade with artillery support and air defenceF27 Maritime Reconnaissance AircraftSupport from Moron Air Base (nearest mainland Spanish airbase, within 1,500km of most parts of the archipelago)3 P-3 Orion Maritime Patrol Aircraft equipped for anti-ship warfareThe majority of Spain\u2019s 70-strong Eurofighter Typhoon fleet (2/3 squadrons)Still, for the sake of the question assuming Morocco has captured the islands, presumably with tens of thousands of soldiers procured to look after them for the time being - maybe more with such a large population - they would have their navy of an ASW frigate, half a dozen corvettes and a squadron or two of patrol vessels; an Air Force of maybe 60 combat aircraft - the most advanced being the F-16 Block 52+ - a reasonably modern variant of a gradually more dated airframe - and the lesss advanced being a mixture of the F1 and F-5E, both from the early 1970s.  Most Moroccan aircraft wouldn\u2019t look entirely out of place in a Cold War-era Middle East conflict. The forces are competent, although Spain could likely bring all of its fixed wing Air Force within range of them in a matter of days, including 70 F/A-18s (maybe 50 if some are lost on the island), a similar number of Typhoons, about a dozen AV-8B Harriers, and 15 maritime patrol aircraft including a flight of P-3 Orions for anti-ship/submarine warfare.  Comparatively, the Spanish aircraft are far more advanced in weapons, sensor and the planes themselves. The Typhoons alone could gain clear air superiority with relative ease against the Moroccan aerial forces while Spanish submarines and P-3s could dispatch the surface fleet. With no further support available, the Moroccan land forces would be vulnerable to overwhelming fire superiority and likely have little option but to surrender or sue for peace. This is all assuming NATO doesn\u2019t get involved, in which case there may be 1\u20132 USN Carrier Strike Groups, another carrier or two from France/Britain/Italy, an assortment of additional warships over countless combat aircraft operating from nearby airbases.

You see, if Morocco invaded the Canary Islands successfully, they would celebrate it. Through a huge party. The Canary islanders are pretty used to it. So the Moroccan forces would go party, they would drink themselves silly and then wake up to find themselves hungover, naked, probably with a stupid tatoo somewhere they don\u2019t want others to know, and with the islands back in Spanish control\u2026 This IS a pretty silly question. :) ",
