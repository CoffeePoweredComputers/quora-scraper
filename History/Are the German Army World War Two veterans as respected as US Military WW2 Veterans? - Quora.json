            "answer_text": "The esteem a soldier is being held in depends to the largest degree upon the worthiness your fellow citizens apply to the cause you were fighting for. In that respect the WWII American soldiers are regarded as \u201cthe greatest generation\u201d, while the returning Vietnam vets were held in somewhat lesser regard. This applies in the same way to the German WWII vets. Right after the war, the members of their generation thought highly of their returning fathers, sons, brothers and neighbors. Very few Germans saw the victorious Russians, Americans and Brits as liberators. The behavior of the occupying troops, particularly the Russians, did nothing to mitigate that impression. The German soldier was viewed mainly as a valiant fighter, who tried to defend his family and country despite insurmountable odds against the evils of communism and this was also glorified in pulp magazines like \u201cDer Landser\u201d. At least this was the view in the Western part, while in the communist Eastern part the Wehrmacht soldier had been depicted as evil capitalist servant from the beginning by the ruling Russian occupiers. It was only in the 60\u2019s, when the postwar generation adopted the story about the \u201cevils\u201d of their parent generation, which was pushed by largely leftist media, as a club to rebel against their parents. Incoming (1969) Social Democrat chancellor Willy Brandt, the Obama of German politics, was reviled as a traitor by the older generation because he had spent the war as an anti-German resistance fighter in Norway. Even worse viewed was his willingness to sign away the rights to parts of Germany that had been placed under Polish administration until the signing of a peace treaty, as well as his Kniefall (\u201cbending of the knee\u201d) in Warsaw as an acknowledgement of German culpability. Under his administration an intense campaign was launched by the government in education as well as in the media against any glorification of the Wehrmacht, culminating later in the criminalization of dissenting views about certain aspects of WWII as \u201chate speech\u201d. Government sponsored traveling exhibits depicted the \u201ccrimes of German Wehrmacht soldiers\u201d and indicted the entire generation as the \u201cmurder generation\u201d. So within a generation a massive reeducation effort resulted in an entire generation of soldiers falling from grace in the eyes of a nation. Vae victis. ",

It wasn\u2019t special, it wasn\u2019t voluntary, and it isn\u2019t glorified like it is in America. Think about it. How many WW2 movies has America made. How many WW2 video games? They\u2019re STILL making them. Americans fetishize WW2 and their military, both back then and now. No aspect of this exists in Germany. ",

The answers to these questions would cover Germans\u2019 attitude to people having been in Germany\u2019s armed forces in World War II. To be male and a member of a certain age cohort means (with rare exceptions) being a World War II veteran. That means people are generally considered to have had no agency in being in the World War II military. Now, any particulars of their service may be subject to censure or occasionally praise. ",
