            "answer_text": "Luis de Torres was Christopher Columbus's official translator on his first voyage to the New World. Columbus hoped de Torres's Jewish origins would enable communication with local Jewish traders in Asia (the presumed and hoped-for destination). De Torres was fluent in Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic, and Portuguese. He was among those Spaniards then commonly called marranos: a Jewish convert to the Catholic faith. In order to avoid King Ferdinand's Edict of Expulsion, de Torres converted to Catholicism before the expedition set sail. Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic, and Portuguese were of course useless. But Columbus's diary tells us Cuba's Ta\u00edno natives were far from primitive. An ingenious and resourceful people, they were experienced long-distance travelers, traders, and communicators. Their largest canoes, crafted from massive cedar trees, could hold as many as 100 rowers, plus food and water for a 2-week journey, plus nets filled with cargo for barter. Columbus expressed astonishment at their navigation skills in the open sea. The Ta\u00ednos sent trade missions across the Caribbean, throughout the Greater Antilles, Hispaniola, and even the Yucatan. They engaged in barter with many lands, including pre-Columbian cultures in what is now Mexico. The Ta\u00edno language was of course very different from the Mayan. Their communications skills would have therefore been superlative. They would have used those same skills to understand the European newcomers. As with every first meeting among foreign cultures, communications evolved at first through sign language. Eventually, each side would communicate to the other essential words necessary for survival, beginning with: Friendship; gift-giving; tides; currents; storms; reefs and breakers; billows; whirlpools; hurricanes; weather patterns and weather warnings; distances between habitable places; hunting and fishing grounds; geographic boundaries; neighbors, whether friend or foe; sources of food and water; goods for trade... The Spanish and English languages today both incorporate words derived from the Ta\u00ednos, and learned by Columbus' crew. Hurricane: derived from the word hurac\u00e1nCanoe: derived from the word canoaBarbecue: derived from the word barbacoaHammock: derived from the word hamacaTobacco: derived from the word tabacoSavanna: derived from the word sabana Manatee: derived from the word manat\u00ed Luckily for Columbus, he landed among Ta\u00ednos and not their fiercer cousins, the cannibalistic Caribes (for whom the Caribbean is named). The Ta\u00ednos were described in his letter to his Spanish monarchs--first landfall on Cuban shores, October 27, 1492: \u201cThey are well-built, with good bodies and handsome features. They are the finest people on Earth, lacking any knowledge of evil. They neither murder nor steal [and] display the most singular loving behavior\u2026always gentle and always laughing. \"They are ingenious and free with all they have; of anything they possess, if it be asked of them, they never say no. They are a very loving people and without covetousness. They are adaptable for every purpose, and I declare to your Highnesses that there is no better country or better people in the world than these.
