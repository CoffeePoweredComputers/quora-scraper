            "answer_text": "\u201cRelative poverty views poverty as socially defined and dependent on social context, hence relative poverty is a measure of income inequality. Usually, relative poverty is measured as the percentage of the population with income less than some fixed proportion of median income.\u201d and \u201cAbsolute poverty refers to a set standard which is consistent over time and between countries. First introduced in 1990, the dollar a day poverty line measured absolute poverty by the standards of the world\u2019s poorest countries. The World Bank defined the new international poverty line as $1.25 a day in 2008 for 2005 (equivalent to $1.00 a day in 1996 US prices). In October 2015, they reset it to $1.90 a day.\u201d from Poverty - Wikipedia. In the US, there is a government defined poverty level (which varies each year). Public welfare program eligibility is often based as a percentage of this level of income. You can find the current figures at 2017 Federal Poverty Level Information - 2017 FPL. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolute poverty refers to the state in which an individual cannot afford a basic subsistence level i.e. is insufficient in basic necessities of life like food, clothing and shelter. Since income and food consumption are the most important criteria to check on well being of an individual, they are used to define what we call as a poverty line. Poverty line is a threshold level that defines individuals living in absolute poverty as the ones living below it. They are the ones who are unable to meet basic human needs. However, this minimum income or consumption threshold needed for a healthy living would differ from society to society. For instance, there has to be a different threshold of poverty for people living in metros vis a vis in villages given that the living cost differ highly in the two regions or between USA and India given that two countries differ in many aspects such as population, development, infrastructure etc. That is where the concept of relative poverty comes into picture. It is a concept that refers to the phenomenon of relative deprivation. It measures the degree of poverty. It refers to individuals or groups that lack in resources when compared with other members of the society they belong to. That is why, there can be cases where people in relative poverty group might be living above subsistence level i.e. though such people are able to maintain a basic minimum living standard but then no way are their conditions good enough in regards to the society they live in . Thus, the difference between the two concepts stems out of absolute level of deprivation (absolute poverty) and culturally defined standard of living (relative poverty). ",
