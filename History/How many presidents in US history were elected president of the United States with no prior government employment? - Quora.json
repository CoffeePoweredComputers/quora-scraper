            "answer_text": "from ThoughtCo. No Political Experience at All There are six presidents who had no political experience before entering the White House. Most of them were war generals and American heroes, but they had never held elected office before the presidency. They fared better than many big-city mayors including Rudy Giuliani of New York and state legislators in trying to run for the White House. 01 of 06 Donald Trump  Tom Pennington / Getty Images Republican Donald Trump stunned the political establishment in the 2016 election by defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state under President Barack Obama. Clinton had the political pedigree; Trump, a wealthy real estate developer and reality television star, had the benefit of being an outsider at a time when voters were especially angry at the establishment class in Washington, D.C. Trump had never been elected to a political office before winning the 2016 presidential election. 02 of 06 Dwight D. Eisenhower  The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images / Getty Images Dwight D. Eisenhower was the 34th president of the United States and the most recent president without any prior political experience. Eisenhower, elected in 1952, was a five-star general and the commander of Allied Forces in Europe during World War II. 03 of 06 Ulysses S. Grant  Afro Newspaper/Gado / Getty Images Ulysses S. Grant served as the 18th president of the United States. Though Grant had no political experience and had never held elected office, he was an American war hero. Grant served as the commanding general of the Union Armies in 1865 and led his troops to victory over the Confederacy in the Civil War. Grant was a farm boy from Ohio who was educated at West Point and, upon graduation, placed in the infantry. 04 of 06 William Howard Taft  Cincinnati Museum Center / Getty Images William Howard Taft served as the 27th president of the United States. He was an attorney by trade who served as a prosecutor in Ohio before becoming a judge at the local and federal levels. He served as a secretary of war under President Theodore Roosevelt but held no elected office in the United States before winning the presidency in 1908. Taft showed a clear dislike of politics, referring to his campaign as \"one of the most uncomfortable four months of my life.\" 05 of 06 Herbert Hoover  The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images / Getty Images Herbert Hoover was the 31st president of the United States. He is considered the president with the least amount of political experience in history. Hoover was a mining engineer by trade and made millions. Widely hailed for his work distributing food and managing relief efforts at home during World War I, he was nominated to serve as the secretary of commerce and did so under \u200bPresidents Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge. 06 of 06 Zachary Taylor  De Agostini Picture Library/Getty Images Zachary Taylor served as the 12th president of the United States. He had no political experience, but was a career military officer who served his country admirably as an Army general during the Mexican-American War and the War of 1812. His inexperience showed. According to his White House biography, Taylor \"acted at times as though he were above parties and politics. As disheveled as always, Taylor tried to run his administration in the same rule-of-thumb fashion with which he had fought Indians.\" ",

            "answer_text": "List of presidents of the United States by previous experience - Wikipedia It\u2019s quite instructive to read through that list of the positions held prior to becoming president. There are only four who had no prior state or national elected positions, and three of those came out of the military: Zachary Taylor*, U. S. Grant*, and Dwight Eisenhower. And then there\u2019s #45. No military experience, no government experience, no experience running a publicly-traded corporation, where you are answerable for your decisions\u2014just a privately held business whose operations are opaque. And it shows! ~~~ *\u201dTaylor previously was a career officer in the United States Army, rose to the rank of major general and became a national hero as a result of his victories in the Mexican\u2013American War. As a result, he won election to the White House despite his vague political beliefs. His top priority as president was preserving the Union. He died sixteen months into his term. He made no progress on the most divisive issue in Congress, slavery. \u201c *Grant was more successful: \u201cBefore his presidency, Grant led the Union Army as Commanding General of the United States Army in winning the American Civil War. As president, Grant worked with the Radical Republicans during Reconstruction to protect blacks and reestablish the public credit, while rebuilding the U.S. Navy.\u201d ",
