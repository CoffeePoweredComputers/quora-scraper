Wounded Knee, the most recent clash between the US government and Native Americans, occurred in 1973.The same year as Watergate. Edit: I have noticed that a lot of you are confused by me saying that Wounded Knee happened at the same time as Watergate. On the 27th of February, 1973, approximately 200 Oglala Lakota and followers of the American Indian Movement(AIM) seized and occupied the town of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The protest followed the failure of an effort of the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO) to impeach tribal president Richard Wilson, whom they accused of corruption and abuse of opponents. Additionally, protesters criticized the United States government's failure to fulfill treaties with Native American people and demanded the reopening of treaty negotiations. I think that should clear things up. ",
