            "answer_text": "The Kolar Gold Fields really do exist in Kolar district of Karnataka. But the slavery and mafia shown in the movie may or may not be true. Because there is no record of any criminal activities happening there in any medium. Coming to Inayat Khan and Ramika Sem, I think these characters were largely inspired by Dawood Ibrahim and Indira Gandhi respectively. Dawood Ibrahim controlled Indian Mafia while being exiled in Dubai. He was feared by everyone in India even though he was in Dubai. Indira Gandhi is India's most powerful woman politician whose last name commanded the respect of the masses. ",
