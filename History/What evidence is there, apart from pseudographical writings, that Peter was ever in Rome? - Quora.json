            "answer_text": "There is no reasonable evidence that the apostle Peter was ever in Rome. Paul says that Peter went to Antioch in modern Syria and hints that Peter may have gone as far as Greece, but makes no mention of Peter in Rome. Certainly, Peter was not in Rome when Paul wrote his Epistle to the Romans. Clement of Rome mentions, in 1 Clement, the difficulties that Peter had faced until he finally died, but makes no suggestion that Peter was ever in Rome although to have done so would have enhanced his own prestige and given force to his letter.
