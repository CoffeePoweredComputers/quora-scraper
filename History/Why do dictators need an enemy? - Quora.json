            "answer_text": "Dictators do not hold power because they are tyrants. No dictator has ever held his position firmly unless he has a leverage over public\u2019s support. In fact, you start naming all dictators one by one: Hitler, Stalin, Gaddafi, Saddam, Kim Jong; all of them were significantly popular in their respective countries. Having an enemy is an easy way to outsource every problem in the country to the outsiders. This keeps an accountability in check, as local population is made to believe that it is the external enemy that is causing you problems and you can suffer certain things at hands of your own government in order to defeat the enemy. Uprisings by local population have significant impacts on uprooting dictatorships. Arab Spring uprooted nearly half the dictatorships because they became \u201cinformed\u201d. Citizens of countries like Iran and North Korea do not realize the shit their rulers do to them because they think it is okay for them to suffer in their daily lives when their supreme leader is fighting the US. The problem with that, is the lack of information. This is the reason why majority of dictatorships also censor internet and social media to a large extent. Shifting the blame and building support by instilling a false sense of nationalism is an easy way for dictators to remain in power. ",

            "answer_text": "Because nothing makes a bad choice look good like a worse choice. I mean, it\u2019s how we got Trump. I imagine more people voted against either candidate than voted for them. And that\u2019s how it was framed. Sure Trump is bad, but Hillary is worse! And vice versa. Any talk of simply choosing someone else that doesn\u2019t disgust you? Oh that gets turned away quick. It\u2019s too important. You\u2019ll throw your vote away! And that? That\u2019s in a mostly functioning democracy. The less functional it gets? The more dire the proclamations. This last election in Israel was their 3rd or 4th time attempting to form a government recently. Go read up on some of the ad campaigns for that circus. And understand Israel is probably functioning a little better than we are. Can\u2019t wait for November. But I digress. The uglier your candidate, the uglier you have to make the opponent. Eventually? You get used to ugly candidates. It\u2019s just the way of things. If one ugly candidate wants to just stay so you don\u2019t have to figure out the lesser of evils anymore, so long as the trains run on time I guess that\u2019s fine. And that\u2019s how democracies die. From accepting the unacceptable. ",
