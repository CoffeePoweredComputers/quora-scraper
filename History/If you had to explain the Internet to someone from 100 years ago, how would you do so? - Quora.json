            "answer_text": "I would refer to the teleprinter, the telephone, the phonograph, the library, and motion pictures, since all these existed at that time. So, I'm talking to a guy in bar, and ... Me: First, let me order a round of martinis. OK, now, wait'll you hear this sh..., uh, stuff. You guys already have telegraph, phone, movies -all that stuff. Now, imagine that almost everyone had this stuff all in one box that sat on a desk at your home. Over the phone lines, you send and receive messages to everyone else, watching your own message and replies appearing on a tiny movie screen at the front of the box. And if you wanted a copy on paper, you could type it out with the press of a button. Guy: But what if I am not there to see a message when it comes in? What happens to it? Me: No problem, everything gets recorded in a kind of central warehouse before it is relayed to you -sort of like a phonograph, except it is for words, symbols, and even complete pictures - even moving pictures. Guy: Must be a pretty big warehouse. How about another martini? My treat. Me: It is, but not as big as you might imagine. First of all, the equipment that does this is tiny. Remember that story in the paper the other day about the Lord's prayer being printed on a match stick? Its kind of like that, only much smaller. And everything is recorded using magnetism applied over teeny tiny magnetic surface. There are also things called transistors which are switches that are so small you can't really even see them without a big magnifying glass. Guy: You're making this up. Me: No I'm not - you guys already do this with the telephone. That's how the ear piece and microphone work, right? Same thing, only a lot more, and really tiny. You can get millions of these little suckers on a surface no bigger than a matchbox. Now, let ME get our next round or martinis... Guy: Well s'long as yer buyin.... And how do you make magnets work with moshun pitchers, anyway? Me: Is thiz way: OK, s'pose we took just one frame of a movie, like it was a photograph all by isself, 'K? Then we break it up into millions of tiny dots, each dot being black, white or the shade of gray where the dot was located, 'K? 'N then, we apply the magnitism for each dot so that the force tells us how light or dark each dot iz. Then we pack it all together and send it out. At the other end, we just play it back! Guy: Yer still makin' thiz up. Gimme 'nother martini. Me: Waiter! Another round, pleeze. OK, lemme tell you how zis really wurks. You know how Morse code works? Dots and dashes? Guy: Uh-huh. Me: Think about it. Really. If words can be broken down into dots and dashes, then so can anything else. But this 'vention, which you'll be oozing in 'nother 70 years, will jes use 0's and 1's, strung t'gether like a Morse code message. Guy: Mus take an awful lot of 'em. Mus take long time to send... Me: It duz take zillions of 'em, but it goes fast as 'lectricity. And they don' send just one stream; they send many streams side by side - like the 4 lane street here in town, only many more streams then that. Guy: I dunno.... Me: Look - I know! Ya know the new teletype at Western Union? It uses a paper tape with holes in it to run the teletype musheen. And they don't have just one machine - they got a whole wall of 'em. Thaz fast, y' know? Same thing here, only fasser! Guy: So wuts thiz thing called, any way? Me: The box on your desk is called a computer. Comes with keyboard, a little movie screen, its own little warehouse for information, and some 'lectrical cirkits that make it all woooorrkk (hic!). An' the phone wires all over the country and the big warehouses -those are called the \"Internet.\" Guy: Sounds complkated (hic!). How duz anyone unnerstan it? Me: Right now, you unnerstan more 'n most of them dooooo (hic!) Guy: OK, I'll go along with you, fer now. So wud else iz in the (hic!) fuuuture? Me: All thiz stiff will fit in a little box 'bout the size of your cigarette case (hic.) Guy: Yer making thiz up. Ledz have 'nother martini. Me: My treat. That's how I'd do it. Hic. ",

            "answer_text": "The year is 1920, nobody has any computers, not even the places that will eventually develop the first computers. Back in this day if you asked someone about a computer, they would think it was a job. You can get a job as a computer, in which case you would spend your whole day doing math. So here I am, having stepped out of my time machine, which either looks like a blue police call box, a modified Delorean, or a pocket watch, and I find someone to talk to. \u201cIn the future nearly everyone who lives in North America, Europe and China will have a device small enough to fit in their pocket, it will be about the size of a small book. The light that we can see with our eyes is only a narrow part of a much wider electromagnetic spectrum, it is not unlike looking at a set of encyclopedias (Wikipedia in book form), and only being able to look up things beginning with the letter \u2018Q'. Now this light that is beyond the range of the Human eye to see, can be incredibly useful. These devices that fit inside a person's pocket use this invisible light to communicate with a vast network of large complex artificial brains. These artificial brains are built by Humans, they can store information, yet have no will of their own. They can solve complex logical, mathematical and scientific problems much faster than any Human could, and they store within them the sum total of all knowledge ever recorded by Humans. Imagine for a moment that you could reach into your pocket, speak with your voice, and ask this thing a question, and if the answer is known to anyone, anywhere, then the device will tell you the answer. This same device also allows me to communicate with people all over the world in seconds.\u201d ",
