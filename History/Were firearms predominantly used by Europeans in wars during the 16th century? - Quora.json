            "answer_text": "In the 16th Century CE, firearms, cannon and infantry matchlocks sprung up over all the world. Firearm users: Ottoman, Mughal, Persia, Japan, Somalia, Mysore, OTTOMAN 16TH CENTURY CEThe 16th century saw the first widespread use of the matchlock musket as a decisive weapon on the battlefield with the Turks becoming leaders in this regard. The first of these campaigns was the campaign against the Persians in 1514 under Yavuz Sultan Selim, or Selim the Grim. Armed with gunpowder weapons, his army defeated the Persians at the Battle of Chaldiran. [11] After his victory over the Safavids, Selim turned his attention towards the Mamluk dynasty in Egypt. The decisive battle of his campaign against the Mamluks, and the battle which highlighted the importance of the musket in the Ottoman military, was the Battle of Raydaniyah, fought in 1517. There, Selim outflanked the entrenched Mamluk artillery, and attacked the Mamluk forces with his Janissaries. The Janissaries, armed with firearms, destroyed the Mamluk army, armed mostly with traditional swords and javelins. [12] Reference was made by Jo\u00e3o de Barros to a sea battle outside Jiddah, in 1517, between Portuguese and Ottoman vessels. The Muslim force under Salman Reis had \"three or four basilisks firing balls of thirty palms in circumference\". [13] This was estimated to be a cannon of about 90 inch bore \"firing cut stone balls of approximately 1,000 pounds (453 kg)\". [13] After the death of Selim, he was succeeded by his son Suleiman the Magnificent. During his reign, gunpowder weapons continued to be used effectively. One important example, is the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526. During this battle, Ottoman artillery, and Janissaries armed with muskets, were able to cut down charging Hungarian cavalry.  The Ottoman cannon used to destroy the walls of Constantinople in 1453 PERSIASoon after the Ottoman Empire, two other Muslim gunpowder empires appeared: the Safavid Empire in Persia and the Mughal Empire in India. They both began in the early 16th century but later collapsed in the 18th century. The refusal of their Qizilbash forces to use firearms contributed to the Safavid rout at Chaldiran in 1514. [17] Despite this initial reluctance, the Persians very rapidly acquired the art of making and using handguns. A Venetian envoy, Vincenzo di Alessandri, in a report presented to the Council of Ten on 24 September 1572, observes:\"They used for arms, swords, lances, arquebuses, which all the soldiers carry and use; their arms are also superior and better tempered than those of any other nation. The barrels of the arquebuses are generally six spans long, and carry a ball little less than three ounces in weight. They use them with such facility that it does not hinder them drawing their bows nor handling their swords, keeping the latter hung at their saddle bows till occasion requires them. The arquebus is then put away behind the back so that one weapon does not impede the use of the other.\" MUGHAL:Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire on the Indian subcontinent, employed firearms, gun carts and movable artillery in battle. In particular, he used them at the first Battle of Panipat (1526) to defeat the much larger forces of Ibrahim Lodhi, the last ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. Other battles he fought using gunpowder weapons include the Battle of Khanwa in 1527 against Rana Sanga, and the Battle of Ghaghra in 1529. His descendants also employed gunpowder weapons in their expansion of the Mughal Empire, such as Akbar the Great at the second Battle of Panipat (1556) against Adil Shah Suri and Hemu of the Sur Dynasty. In 1582, Fathullah Shirazi, a Persian-Indian developed a seventeen-barrelled cannon, fired with a matchlock..  Mughal army at siege  Mughal soldier with matchlock.  Mughal Artillerists JAPAN: Japan got into the gunpowder game in the 16th century.In Japan the pattern of military development was somewhat different from that in Europe or the Middle East. Soon after contact with Portuguese traders in the year 1543, firearms were adopted in the nation and an era of gunpowder warfare followed for several decades, culminating at the famous Battle of Nagashino in 1575, where volley fire was introduced. The Japanese under Toyotomi Hideyoshi also used firearms against the Koreans and Chinese during the Imjin War of the 1590s, which proved effective, yet the Chinese and Koreans matched this with farther-range cannon fire.

            "answer_text": "That depends on what you mean by \"predominantly.\" There were firearms, and they were used in war, but they were treated more like archers, firing volleys at a distant force before the direct engagement. Because they were muzzle-loaded and not terribly accurate or reliable or powerful at a distance, they weren't the primary weapons used by infantry, which was still something more akin to a spear or pike. Even the musket infantry used a mounted bayonet and treated the weapon more like a pike once the direct engagement had begun. Cavalry continued to use swords and pikes for some time. Firearms as primary weapons really began with the flintlock musket, which didnt come into common usage until the 1690's. The earliest effective infantry usage of firearms was probably by Spain in the early 1700s in the war of Spanish succession. Prior to that, the plate mail worn by infantry protected them from musket fire, but the flintlock could puncture plate at 100 yards, effectively making armor more of a hindrance than a benefit. The nature of war changed from medieval sword and pike fighting to something more like firearms combat during the 1700's. Artillery, however, had been used very effectively for more than 100 years before shoulder-fired firearms became a viable option for infantry. ",
