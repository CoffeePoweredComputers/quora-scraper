            "answer_text": "Persia wasn\u2019t perpetually fighting Greece and Rome. There was a period from the Achemenid Empire through Alexander when various Persians were in conflicts with Greeks, and later a period of repeated conflicts with Rome when they took over the Middle East several centuries later and ending with the rise of Islam. That said, the Persian sphere of influence was always far more involved with the Mediterranean world than with China. The Mediterranean is closer and more physically accessible. It would be maybe 800\u2013900 miles from any given Persian capital to the easternmost major cities of the Mediterranean world like Tyre and Damascus, and even less from Mesopotamia, which formed both an important economic and political region in its own right and a sort of convenient border between the two regions. Even in pre-classical antiquity, Persians were butting up against the Mediterranean, even to the point of controlling the Levant and Egypt from time to time. China, on the other hand, is significantly farther away. It\u2019s two or three times as far from the Persian heartland to Dunhuang, the traditional Chinese frontier town. Moreover, the terrain in the way is among the most rugged in the world: the Pamirs, the Hindu Kush, and other immense mountain ranges have to be negotiated or circumvented to get from Persia to China or vice versa. Without ascribing the status of a \u201cnatural border\u201d to any given place, it\u2019s nevertheless pretty clear that an empire based in Persia would be reaching or going past the sustainable limits of its influence to project force all the way to China and vice versa. Mind you, they did come into conflict at one point. In 751 AD, a Muslim army from a Persianizing caliphate whose capital was at that point in Iraq (but not quite yet Baghdad) along with some local allies and auxiliaries came fought a battle against the Tang-backed forces of a local client kingdom at Talas river in Central Asia. The Muslims won, though it was a tactical rather than strategic victory, and the Chinese only pulled back from the area a few years later as a consequence of the An Lushan rebellion. But both empires were at if not beyond reasonable limits of expansion, and no later Persian-based empire extended sufficiently east nor Chinese empire sufficiently west to fight another such battle.

            "answer_text": "Firstly - alas - too much of what we know about the various ancient Persian Empires comes from Greek and Roman source - think Herodotus - and so we hear a lot more about Persia\u2019s relationship with Greece and Rome than that with everyone else. We have no idea about large parts of Persian history, and particularly Persia\u2019s history with China.  Next, lets look at a \u2018classic\u2019 Persian Empire - it\u2019s basically what is now Iran - projecting power into the neighbours when it\u2019s strong. That means, Iraq, Armenia, Central Asia, Afghanistan, NW India. For the Persians controlling the arc of territory though Central Asia, Afghanistan and NW India was probably something like 80% of their military energy. A classic window onto this is that Alexander took more time and had more trouble stabilising this region under his rule than conquering the core of the Persian Empire itself!!! So during the \u2018good years\u2019 Persian Empires were able to project power into places like Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, Sogdia and Bactria, On the other hand when China was strong it was able to project power into what is now Xinjiang, the Tarim basin land of the ancient Tokharians. The \u2018definitive\u2019 section of the Silk Road is between Sogdia/Bactria and the Tarim basin, so I assume the Persians had far more knowledge and contact with the Chinese than some give them credit for. The mountain passes of the Hindu Kush between Bactria/Sogdia and the Tarim Basin are pretty serious, the land is remote, barely inhabited and has long cold winters. Both these powers were generally at their limits controlling \u2018their\u2019 side of the pass. Attempting to gain control of the other side of the pass was a major additional push and always a step too far and from what we know, rarely, rarely attempted. The passes are too high, the summers are too short and the distances without supplies are too long.  me approaching the 3700m Torugart Pass in late September (!) 2015 As for the east, the Achaemenid Persians did control what is now Pakistan and bits of India, Alexander turned up here to secure rule of this area and tried to push further into India - but fighting elephants was hard and his army had had enough and wanted to go home. The Achaemenid Persian Kings must have had many similar battles here that we know little or nothing about.  Kushan art from NW India, mixing Buddhism with the Greek art of post Alexander Bactria. Next, under the Parthians this area, and Bactria and the Tarim came under the rule of the \u201cKushans\u201d - which we know a little but not a lot about. What we do know is that from about 220 AD the Kushans were conquered by the Sassanids and until about 380 the Kushan \u2018Shah\u2019 was a client king of Sassanid Persia - perhaps even a relative of the Persian Shah, we don\u2019t know. After that there is no evidence, but the NW Indian and Iranian spheres of influence always clashed in Bactria/Afghanistan. After that there was often major cultural projection from Iran into Bactria /Afghanistan and occasional political power projection. And then many Afghan rulers established power over Pakistan and NW India - and that\u2019s why the Taj Mahal is such a \u2018Persian\u2019 influenced building.  ",
