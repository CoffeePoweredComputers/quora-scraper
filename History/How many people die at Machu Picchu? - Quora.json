            "answer_text": "Actually there are a lot of myths ranking around the death rate in Machu Picchu. It was certainly very scary to hike the stairs up to Huayna Picchu. And I guess there are a lot of inexperienced hikers going up..so well I guess that leads to the nickname \u201cStairs of death\u201d. Here is an article that clears up most of them and quotes some actual news sources. http://www.annees-de-pelerinage.com/huayna-picchu-death-toll-and-accidents/ As far as I can see, people have died. But I guess that applies to any other mountain with high traffic. People tend to forget hiking is dangerous (especially when the weather changes quickly) ",

            "answer_text": "The stairs I believe you're talking about is the trail up to the top of Huayna Picchu, the tall point seen in the background of so many famous Machu Picchu images.  It's a fairly arduous and vertical climb, and there are no handrails or guardrails to speak of. It isn't unheard of for people to fall. It's been a while since I've actually heard of a tourist falling to their death, but earlier this year it was on the news here in Peru that a landscape worker at the site was killed in a fall. Considering that about 400 people a day make the climb, deaths seem pretty rare.  I made the climb back in 2008, with my husband two children aged at the time 8 and 10.  There were even younger children making the climb with their families.  I think it's a place where caution is definitely in order - but it's not to be avoided out of fear. ",
