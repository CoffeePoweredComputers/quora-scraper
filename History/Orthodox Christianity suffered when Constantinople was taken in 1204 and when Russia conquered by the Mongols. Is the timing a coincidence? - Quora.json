In 1204, the Mongols hadn\u2019t even united within the area of Mongolia and were nowhere near Russia until three decades later (1237). By then (the ascension of Baldwin II) the Latin principality of Constantinople was in steep decline, surrounded and threatened by minor principalities of the Roman state and the city population reduced to well under 50,000. Baldwin would spend nearly the rest of his life passing the hat in the West to re-finance his defense of the city, to little avail. He was eventually chased from the city in 1261, just as the Mongol Empire passed its peak of expansion and at the start of the civil war that would disintegrate the empire. Orthodoxy Christianity? Largely undeterred and unaffected by the political events. By the time the Patriarch of Constantinople was re-established in the city proper in 1260, it was clear the Mongol tide was ebbing. Within 40 more years, they were well out of reach militarily, politically, even diplomatically as the last of the Crusader Kingdoms had fallen. ",
