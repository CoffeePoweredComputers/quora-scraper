            "answer_text": "It's called tradition. It's outdated to say the least, and it's origins are quite quirky - way back when, in Middle Ages (era) - each letter of the name cost money to be registered, so simple people went with short names, and people who wanted to flash their wealth went with double and triple names, and royalty went with even more lavish outpours (the full name of Marie Antoinette  is Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna von Habsburg-Lothringen). Now, then things got a little more interesting when people started using middle names to track one's lineage - either patriarchy (father's name) or matriarchy (mother's name). Then, it was abandoned by some, and other names were used - to honor a relative, or to add something unique to an otherwise plain/common names. So, is there a practical side to this? Not really. Will we be abandoning this \"Middle name\" field anytime soon? No way! ",
