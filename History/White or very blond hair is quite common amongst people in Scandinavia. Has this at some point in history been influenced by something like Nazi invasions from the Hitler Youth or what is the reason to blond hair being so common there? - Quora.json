            "answer_text": "Blonde hair did not originate in Scandinavia. The oldest remains carrying the genes for blonde hair were found among the Ancient Northern Eurasian (ANE) Anfontova Gora Complex in Russia and dated to 14 000 years. The descendants of the ANE, the Eastern hunter gatherers who had blonde hair, migrated into Northern Europe during the Mesolithic and that is why there are so many blondes in Scandinavia. Afontova Gora - Wikipedia Afontova Gora is no. 2 on this map:  The Indo-Europeans who were 50% Eastern hunter gatherers and Iran in origin migrated into Europe about 4000 - 3000 years ago and interbred with the blonde, blue eyed hunter gatherers already living in Europe. The Indo-Europeans then took the genes for blonde hair throughout Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and all the way to China and Mongolia. Wherever the Indo-Europeans migrated, they took the genes for blonde hair with them: File:Indo-European migrations.gif - Wikipedia Blonde Mongolian:  Blonde Chinese (Uyghur)  Blonde Yazidi of Iraq:  ",

            "answer_text": "You need to stop believing Nazi propaganda. It wasn't true in the 1930s or 1940s, and it's not true today. There are a lot of blond Germans, but there are also a lot of dark haired Germans (like Hitler was). Scandinavians tend to be blond because most Scandinavians have genes for blond hair. They had blond hair for generations before World War II, and while Norway was occupied by the Nazis, it wouldn't have been enough to change the dominant hair color for the entire region. And given that Scandinavians are more likely to be blond than Germans, the Nazi occupation was likely to produce fewer blond Norwegians, not more. ",

            "answer_text": "Blond hair and pale skin is a genetic variation which is naturally selected for in areas of weak and limited sunlight. It takes many generations for such selection to take place on more than an individual basis. In terms of humans that involves centuries if not millenia. While NAZI ideology idealised blond hair, blue eyes and a pale skin that was just propaganda. Most Germans don\u2019t fit that stereotype and in any case were only in Norway and Denmark (not Sweden) for a few years - not long enough to alter the genetic makeup of an entire country. ",
