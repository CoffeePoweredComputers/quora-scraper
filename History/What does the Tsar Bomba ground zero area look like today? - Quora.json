            "answer_text": "The bomb was an airburst. It was still expected to touch the ground because the fireball was enormous, but the rebound effect of the blast wave from the surface prevented the fireball from contacting the surface. So although the surface received a tremendous blast effect and was bathed in intense radiant energy, it was not a direct part of the explosion. The bomb site is above the arctic circle, and the terrain was glacially scoured and barren before the blast. The bomb location left no lasting mark on the terrain. It looked blasted before the bomb was used, and years later, it looks the same. The short term effect was to melt the snow and create some melt and glassy surfaces on stones exposed to the blast. But it did not create a crater nor rearrange the terrain in any significant manner. The island was used for many nuclear tests. I do not know if other blasts were also conducted in the same vicinity, but I would assume that there were other tests. UPDATE: Russia recently released a 40 minuute documentary made at the time concerning the bomb. It includes footage of the test site before and after the explosion in 1961.  ",
