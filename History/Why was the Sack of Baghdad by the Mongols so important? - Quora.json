            "answer_text": "the destruction and slaughter at Baghdad was a blow to Islam as it was a center of Muslim influence and direction. if the Mongols had done a similar job on Rome it would have likewise been a blow to Christianity. of course the destruction of Baghdad wasn\u2019t just a loss for Muslims. it was just another in a long line of wanton destruction by the Mongols. i totally agree with Professor C P Fitzgerald. the Mongols were the pre-industrial equivalent of atomic war. They destroyed flourishing cities and regions in their march of conquest. they destroyed numerous hospitals, libraries and centers of learning across Eurasia. starting in China then on to places like Riazan, Merv, Baghdad, Aleppo, Kiev, Herat and on and on. all the knowledge accumulated by humanity over centuries wiped away by a bunch of thoughtless goons and thugs in a few days of destruction. i have yet to hear the Mongol apologists ever demonstrate how the Mongols made up for all the art, science and technology that they wiped away never mind the staggering loss of life. please tell me how they did it?
