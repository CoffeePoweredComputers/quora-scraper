            "answer_text": "The United States was a nation after 1865, not an empire or a confederation. It was never subject to being \u201cdissolved\u201d like the Soviet Union. Tsarist Russia was a multinational state created by the Grand Princes of Muscovy in the 15th and 16th Centuries out of Russian-speaking regions of Eastern Europe. The Muscovites added more territory and a few dozen other ethnic groups and cultures between the 16th and 19th Centuries. The Romanov tsars attempted to meld their empire into a Russian nation-state in the 19th and early 20th Centuries, but that nation was never more than a bare majority of ethnic Russians. After the collapse of the tsarist empire, a number of different nations separated themselves from the central government in Moscow. That central government, which fell under the control of the Communist Bolsheviks, eventually formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics out of a majority Russian Soviet Socialist Republic and fourteen other nominally sovereign and non-Russian republics. Under Josef Stalin and later Soviet leaders, there was a concerted effort, as under the tsarist government, to \u201cRussify\u201d the non-Russian parts of the Soviet Union in order to make the Soviet Union a Russian national state. This process was not successful before the Soviet government collapsed in 1991 and the Soviet system was abandoned in every country in the world save for the Peoples Republic of Korea. Consequently, the historical process that caused the Soviet Union to dissolve was never possible for the United States. The unity of the United States under a single government, a single primary language, and a multi-faceted but single common culture was never in question during the Cold War. ",
