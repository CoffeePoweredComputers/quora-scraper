            "answer_text": "10 Things You Might Not Know About H\u00e4gar the Horrible BY JAKE ROSSEN  For 45 years, the anachronistic adventures of a Scandinavian Viking named H\u00e4gar have populated the funny papers. Created by cartoonist Dik Browne, Hagar the Horrible is less about raiding and pillaging and more about H\u00e4gar\u2019s domestic squabbles with wife Helga. If you\u2019re a fan of this red-bearded savage with a surprisingly gentle demeanor, check out some facts about the strip\u2019s history, H\u00e4gar\u2019s status as a soda pitchman, and his stint as a college football mascot. 1. H\u00c4GAR IS NAMED AFTER HIS CREATOR. Richard Arthur \u201cDik\u201d Browne got his start drawing courtroom sketches for New York newspapers; he debuted a military strip, Ginny Jeep, for servicemen after entering the Army in 1942. Following an advertising stint where he created the Chiquita Banana logo, he was asked to tackle art duties on the 1954 Beetle Bailey spinoff strip Hi and Lois. When he felt an urge to create his own strip in 1973, Browne thought back to how his children called him \u201cH\u00e4gar the Horrible\u201d when he would playfully chase them around the house. \u201cImmediately, I thought Viking,\u201d he told People in 1978. H\u00e4gar was soon the fastest-growing strip in history, appearing over 1000 papers. 2. HE COULD HAVE BEEN BULBAR THE BARBARIAN.  KING FEATURES SYNDICATE Working on Hi and Lois with cartoonist Mort Walker (Beetle Bailey) gave Browne an opportunity to solicit advice on H\u00e4gar from his more experienced colleague. As Walker recalled, he thought \u201cH\u00e4gar\u201d would be too hard for people to pronounce or spell and suggested Browne go with \u201cBulbar the Barbarian\u201d instead. Browne brushed off the suggestion, preferring his own alliterative title. 3. A HEART ATTACK COULD HAVE CHANGED H\u00c4GAR\u2019S FATE. When Browne came up with H\u00e4gar, he sent it along to a syndicate editor he knew from his work on Hi and Lois. According to Chris Browne, Dik\u2019s son and the eventual artist for H\u00e4gar after his father passed away in 1989, the man originally promised to look at it after he got back from his vacation. He changed his mind at the last minute, reviewing and accepting the strip before leaving. Just days later, while on his ski vacation, the editor had a heart attack and died. If he hadn\u2019t approved the strip prior to his passing, Browne said, H\u00e4gar may never have seen print. 4. THE STRIP HELPED BROWNE AVOID VANDALS.  KING FEATURES SYNDICATE Chris Browne recalled that Halloween in his Connecticut neighborhood was a time for kids to show their appreciation for his father\u2019s work. While trick-or-treaters were busy covering nearby houses in toilet paper or spray paint, they spared the Browne residence. The only evidence of their vandalism was a spray-painted sign that read, \u201cMr. Browne, We Love H\u00e4gar.\u201d 5. BROWNE\u2019S DAUGHTER TALKED HIM OUT OF KIDNAPPING PLOTS. Vikings were not known for being advocates for human rights. H\u00e4gar, despite his relatively genteel persona, still exhibited some barbaric traits, such as running off with \u201cmaidens\u201d after a plundering session. Speaking with the Associated Press in 1983, Browne admitted he toned down the more lecherous side of H\u00e4gar after getting complaints from his daughter. \u201cRunning off with a maiden isn\u2019t funny,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime.\u201d 6. H\u00c4GAR ENDORSED SODA. Despite his preference for alcohol, H\u00e4gar apparently had a bit of a sweet tooth as well. In the 1970s, King Features licensed out a line of soda cans featuring some of their most popular comic strip characters, including Popeye, Blondie, and H\u00e4gar. The Viking also shilled for Mug Root Beer in the 1990s. 7. HE WAS A COLLEGE MASCOT. In 1965, Cleveland State University students voted in the name \u201cVikings\u201d for their collegiate basketball team. After using a mascot dubbed Viktorious Vike, the school adopted H\u00e4gar in the 1980s. Both H\u00e4gar and wife Helga appeared at several of the school\u2019s sporting events before being replaced by an original character named Vike. 8. HE EVENTUALLY SOBERED UP.  KING FEATURES SYNDICATE When Dik Browne was working on H\u00e4gar, the Viking was prone to bouts of excessive drinking. When Chris Browne took over the strip, he made a deliberate decision to minimize H\u00e4gar\u2019s imbibing. \"When my father was doing the strip, he did an awful lot of gags about H\u00e4gar falling down drunk and coming home in a wheelbarrow, and as times go on that doesn't strike me as that funny anymore,\u201d Brown told the Chicago Tribune in 1993. \u201cJust about everybody I know has had somebody hurt by alcoholism or substance abuse.\u201d 9. HE HAD HIS OWN HANNA-BARBERA CARTOON. It took some time, but H\u00e4gar was finally honored with the animated special treatment in 1989. Cartoon powerhouse Hanna-Barbera created the 30-minute special, H\u00e4gar the Horrible: H\u00e4gar Knows Best, and cast the Viking as being out of his element after returning home for the first time in years. The voice of Optimus Prime, Peter Cullen, performed the title character. It was later released on DVD as part of a comic strip cartoon collection. 10. HE SAILED INTO THE WIZARD OF ID.  ",
