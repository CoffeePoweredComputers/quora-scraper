            "answer_text": "The land of people who have tasted olive oil and had the salt of Mediterranean in their blood and the sun on their head. For non-Mediterraneans, olive oil freshens body, gives a glare, extends life. This is why we Mediterraneans have a better hold of life, we love to drink and dance. Our lives are worth to live! The salt in blood makes us short fuses but shorter heat. We love people. When together, we are loud, we can\u2019t be silenced. We are loud in anger, we are louder in happiness! We are loud when talking, we are louder when drunk. And the sun gives us our color. Our skin is lighter than Arabs, but not as pale as Northerns. The sun boils our salty blood, but consumes our energy. We need to rest, it isn\u2019t easy to work under the sun. Germans can work relentlessly to keep warm, but we already are warm! We are in the place where the others dream to be! I wrote as if Greek, but what makes people apart under the sun? An invisible line on a paper that isn\u2019t real on the soil, called border. ",
