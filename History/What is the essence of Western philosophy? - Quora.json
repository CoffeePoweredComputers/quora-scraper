            "answer_text": "Questions are the essence of philosophy. The more difficult a question is to answer, the more \u2018philosophical\u2019 that question is. I think of philosophical questions as \u2018proto-questions\u2019 \u2014 questions with many answers, none of which have become permanently definitive or conclusive (yet) in human history. Examples: What exists (what is existence? what does it mean to exist?)?What is reality? What are mind and body?Who and what am I? What is the meaning of (my) life?What can I know? How can I know it?Each of these philosophical (proto-)questions and others like them has many philosophies as as answers to choose from. Anyone who believes their \u2018philosophy of life\u2019 can be fully presented in less than a lifetime is delusional. The answers to philosophical proto-questions are always unfolding and becoming, evolving and transforming, always changing for each of us as individuals as well as for societies and cultures. For a mature and truly rational human individual, \u2018their philosophy of life\u2019 is a moving target: there are only two rational answers \u2014 ongoing communication (with frequent pauses for listening) or silence (broken only with caution and discretion after listening for a significantly longer spell). Western answers to philosophical proto-questions tend to be analytic, positivist, and scientismic. Eastern answers lean more toward being, presence, and transcendence. One eschews or rejects metaphysics while the other accepts or embraces it. Each has elements of the other (mandorla, yin-yang, etc.), but these differences do very broadly apply. ",

            "answer_text": "Western philosophy has traditionally been traced back to a Greek writer named Thales, who is famous for predicting the eclipse of 585 BCE. Plato mentions him in Theaeteus and Chaucer mentions him in \u201cThe Miller\u2019s Tale.\u201d In both instances, Thales is reported to have been walking across a field, observing the heavens, when he fell into a pit or well. That one incident seems to have been the beginning of philosophy as well as the beginning of anti-philosophical prejudices, as Thales was observed in this activity by a smart-alecky young woman who laughed at him for squandering his attention on the distant heavens while ignoring immediate pedestrian hazards. And that illustrates the essence not only of Western philosophy, but the West as a whole. (Well, the latter may be a little overstated.) Thales seems to have looked at the world around him and asked, \u201cWhat is all this really?\u201d His answer was \u201cwater.\u201d And that is the beginning of Western philosophy. He seems to have been the first writer to assume that any question about the universe could be answered by referencing the universe itself; no references to supernatural beings or forces are needed. Additionally, his answer seems to lend itself to some kind of verification that could be performed by any competent person: no priest or uniquely privileged \u201cseer\u201d is needed. When Thales took inquiry in that direction, he set the pattern for philosophical inquiry that remained in its DNA ever after. Here are some of the presuppositions for philosophy as it is done in the West. The truth can be known.All truths about the universe refer to parts of the universe. (No reference to anything supernatural is needed.)Anything that can be known to be true can, in principle, be verified by methods available to everyone. (Knowledge is not a function of the identity of the knower.)",
