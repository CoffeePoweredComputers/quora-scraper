            "answer_text": "Michael, this is a very interesting subject. But let\u2019s consider a relatively recent event - the history of WWII. Imagine two textbooks: one is written by a surviving and maybe even repenting Nazi and another by the US historian, participant of war. One can hypothesize that these textbooks will be extremely different. Or another example: the history of our time, Trump\u2019s presidency, is described in two articles: one is written by a person who has Trump derangement syndrome and another - by Ivanka Trump. I guess these two article will describe this period differently. I think that when numerous historians combine their efforts, ultimately, we have a somewhat precise picture of history. Of course, the vision of a political party (or a specific individual) can dramatically affect the assessment of the past. This quote from my recently published book illustrates this point well: \u201cIf we abstract from the unimportant details, in a pure form, the current choice is between the American dream and the socialist dream. For the American dreamers, the United States is a shining city upon a hill, a noble, generous, and exceptional nation, the symbol of liberty, justice, and prosperity, the subject of admiration of the entire world, and the model for other countries. For the socialist dreamers, America is an evil and corrupt capitalist nation based on the obsolete constitution, founded on the extermination of Native people and slavery and deeply embedded in capitalist inequality, racism, homophobia, and sexism. Socialists think the U.S. exploits other countries and brings mostly misery to the world.\u201d Obviously, I am an anti-socialist and firmly belong to the category of American dreamers. It is a mystery for me why 100 years of socialism failure does not reduce the popularity of socialism. Probably people do not think critically and analytically enough and do not get good education in high schools and college. In conclusion, I can say that the socialism meme is very contagious and present incomparably more danger for the United States and the world than corona virus. (For all Quora people: I\u2019m quoting my book to save my time because I\u2019m answering so many questions, and I\u2019m answering so many questions and wrote a book for the same reason: to rescue this exceptional country from the socialist catastrophe.)

            "answer_text": "Because politicians -just rather analogous to top business persons - think they are God\u2019s gift to humanity (with a few noble exceptions) and can turn their hand to anything and everything - usually they cant. For just because an individual has had success in one area or discipline, it does not necessarily mean they are going to be successful in something else entirely. We place far too much faith and trust in politicians and business persons, who mostly anyway have their own agenda of self enrichment and self aggrandizement. Most people achieved their position primarily through others intervention (family, friends contacts) or through state help (they may indeed have had a certain flair for a specific thing to then develop an enterprise) but generally - with a relatively few exceptions - luck and timing (whether or not intentional) plays a major part. Individuals who are not successful, are invariably, short of luck (temporary or permanent) through various means and factors. It rarely is through refusal to give out hard work productivity. Although many successful persons will boast that they got only where they are through hard graft, brains and brilliance. Delve into the real background of circumstances and scenarios, it is usually very different from what appears to be. Politicians - especially those who have managed to climb the ladder of aggrandizement, whether or not deserved - they implicitly believe so! And are usually desperate for their name to be remembered for eternity if at all possible by fair means or even occasionally foul. They therefore wish to be associated with BIG changes or BIG projects that will resound with their name into the distant future, and those \u2018little plaques\u2019 can of course, duly confirm their status, along with history books or other officialdom.
