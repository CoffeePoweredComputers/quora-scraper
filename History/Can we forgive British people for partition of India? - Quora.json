            "answer_text": "I don't intend to adopt a lamenting tone but sadly we seem to somehow always find a scapegoat for our all our problems be it developmental, political and as is evident by this question, historical. It has been established as a fact based on historical evidence that pre British era India or the India before the plague that was East India Company was a subcontinent that was ruled by thousands of petty Maharajas, Rajas and Nawabs who were always at each other's throats for trivial reasons. The autocracy's bloated ego that used to swell with each \"nazrana\" or offerings from the nobility and the hollow words of flattery that flowed like perpetual rivers by courtiers and patronized poets resulted in these kingdoms becoming so feeble and inept that even a concubine's rhythmic, delicate dance move could break it apart. Opulence, hedonism and slavery to the luxuries of life had so engulfed the autocracy of that period that the hands that once held mighty swords and forged kingdoms out of blood and iron were ornately decorated with Henna and adorned with jewellery. It was in this period of vulnerability that the British entered India with shady intentions and consolidated their tentacles around the golden bird with such speed and efficiency as the world had never witnessed before and has not witnessed since. Despite having suffered unspeakable injustices at the hands of foreign invaders marauding as guides and helpers, we never quite learned to unite as a nation and face the common enemy. The caste issue was always bigger than the white skinned, strange speaking enemy that made people prostrate with the crack of his whip. Personal differences, petty quarrels, family disputes, tribes, religion, regions and even language could gather more support and unite people than the notion of confronting the true enemy that was destroying the nation before their very eyes. A Brahmin would not break bread with someone from a lower caste let alone a non Hindu, a Muslim would be more bothered about the length of his beard and whether his zenana was properly veiled or not, a Sikh would not work with a non Sikh. It were these conspicuous and glaring differences that were too obvious to ignore that had served as the most effective and lethal ammunition for the foreign invaders. The partition of 1947 was only the culmination of simmering tensions that had always existed. Indians had never quite got themselves around the notion of unity and national brotherhood which was the real cause, in my opinion, why India was cleaved into two parts. Pathetically, it didn\u2019t just end there. With utter disregard for human life and human rights, a nation was pulled out prematurely and violently from the womb of unrest and turmoil in the late 20th century, a nation that has never seen prosperity and development since the day it was formed, Bangladesh. To make things worse, a tom and jerry show has ever since continued on the issue of Kashmir. Nobody gives a crap about what the Kashmiris want, what their opinion is. Nobody ever asks them, they are always told. More than 90% of our nation\u2019s army is posted throughout Kashmir making life for the civilians there miserable and consequently turning the place into a breeding ground for insurgents and anti-social elements. We are a nation that thinks not with our brains but that which is the source of testosterone. We are a nation that needs a National Cleanliness Campaign to \u201ccreate awareness\u201d about hygiene. We are a nation where even today humans are treated worse than animals. We are a nation that has learned to speak English better than the mother tongue but still hasn\u2019t learned to respect a queue. We are a nation that still elects criminals and mass murderers as its political leaders who then take decisions that impact not theirs but our own lives. We are a nation that looks for loopholes when the going gets tough. WE need to change this. Only WE can change the status quo. The last held elections in Delhi are evidence of the common man\u2019s power. We need to exercise it. In the words of our nation\u2019s father, we need to be the change we want to see. ",

Many place all over India. Women were ravaged brutally on caste basis....honour killing predominates in some places...khap panchayats rules some other place....though the frequency of these incidence are increasing alarmingly now a days it has to be viewed as odd ones. Majority of our people living harmoniously in India holding the sense of common brotherhood so close to their heart.Before the advent of brittish and during their reign India was a land of severe inequality and social injustice...upper caste dominated and exploited lower caste...social evils reigned..in kerala lower caste women are not allowed to cover their breast...the travencore kings imposed some taxes if their breasts seems larger !!!King was law and caste was king.When brottishers came they slapped lower caste first then over a passage of time slapped everybody.they considered every Indian low even if its a brahmin or valmiki alike. This neglection and denigration invited hatred against brittishers among upper class..railway also united us the caste totned India as Indians are not allowed in high class they are irrespective of the caste sat together in cattle class.... What would have been happened if they had allowe gandhiji to sit in first class compartment....they we would have missed our mahathma ji.Thus what brittishers done to exploit us became a boon to our consolidation and emergence of the feeling of nationality among us....Present day Indian psyche was restructured by British rule....Actually it is a benefitial byproduct of colonial exploitation...modern Indian society is deeply indebted to brittishers . and they have indebted us for their economy....one may view we have paid huge for some benefits but our society was too much rotten at that time.So we can forgive brittishers for what they  have done to us.... But  would  god us pardon for what we have done  and doing to our brothers and sisters.Anyway when kohinoor shines in the British crown Indian pride and glory will shine far far above it.... ",

And then you read world history! Anyways past is part we cant have historical nostalgia, the world issuffering from it. the ISIS is one such brainchild! History is a place to learn and move towards a better past, not repeating the mistakes. Now are we learning anything? That is something about which we should be concerned. ",

Although they have been harmful to our motherland, they have also done some good to our country(You may see old university buildings, public offices and most of all our democracy and constitution). Having said this, I'm not justifying their acts here. It's just that, we have to move on with our things as well. And we are one of the largest trading partner for the British.  PS: We Indians have been proving that we rose like a Phoenix ever since they left us. Remember buddy INDIA is indespensible!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "I would. Maybe I shouldn't. Though they took a lot, they gave a lot too. The integration and unification of India (indirectly), the infrastructure that connects and binds the nation, the administration, the international exposure,... and the most important thing, which I am using right now, is the language that has made India communicate between its own regionally and linguistically different geographies.  Having said all that, the idea of the partition was NOT of the British and it was NOT the British who were solely responsible for the Partition of India. Who's idea it was, is an entirely different story. Though many a media stalwarts give (and prove) their own theories about why, how and who are responsible for the partion, I am of the opinion that the British only FACILITATED the partition which local political people/entities were more responsible for.
