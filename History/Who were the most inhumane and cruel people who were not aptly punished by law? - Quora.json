Others pale in comparison.  Stories from North Korea border on the insane, I've only posted the most credible claims, Kim Jung-il is likely guilty of other crimes that no one knows of because of North Korea's secluded nature. 1) He has brainwashed his entire country into worshiping him, his son and his father. If anyone disagrees with this, that person and all of their friends will be thrown into a concentration camp for 3 generations. (so their great grand children can be set free if the previous two generations have been pious enough and regained enough honor)North Korea has denied these camps exist but we have pictures from space:North Korea\u2019s Largest Concentration Camps on Google EarthAlso we have people who have escaped and told their stories.:Escape from Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey from North Korea to Freedom in the West: Blaine Harden: 9780143122913: Amazon.com: Books   2) he has let his entire country fall into blackness, If you look at pictures from space North Korea is black.    This  is due to Kim having a dispute with Russia which basically cut off all  aide to North Korea, including coal oil etc. The only places with  electricity are the places inhabited by the Kims or hotels specifically  designated for foreigners. (they keep electricity in these places to  make it seem like the claims of no electricity are lies)Breaking News, Analysis, Politics, Blogs, News Photos, Video, Tech Reviews - TIME.com  3)  He is letting his entire country starve, When given handouts from other  countries he and his elite sell the food to the black market to his own  people so he can afford more weapons. Here is a story of a girl who  testifies that she didn't know that starvation was \"bad\" because it was  so common place.Escape   from Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey from North Korea to Freedom   in the West: Blaine Harden: 9780143122913: Amazon.com: BooksNothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea: Barbara Demick: 9780385523912: Amazon.com: Books 4) He rose to power by gaining the favor of his father by creating lavish movies and memorials to his father. He has even kidnapped actresses and directors to help him create better propaganda.

That's right 1/2 a million. The majority of these people hold up colored cards to create beautiful displays. others create costumes and dance.  He also uses children for these plays and there are accounts of outsiders watching children wet themselves because they were not allowed to go to the bathroom. (coming to see this demonstration is one of the only reasons foreigners are allowed to come into North Korea)       6) He has an elite bodyguard that are trained from birth to do nothing but break things. This causes them to suffer from trauma.   7) He has a story about his birth and that is a complete fabrication and is meant to prove his ruling ability. It has him being birthed when a rainbow shoots overhead at the foot of North Korea's sacred mountain. He also has super powers, he could wipe his hand across a map of japan and cause a tsunami.Kim Jong Il: 10 weird facts, propaganda when he was In school he knew enough that he didn't have to take the training normally required by other students, (Even though his teachers have admitted that they wrote his papers for him). He also 'mastered' military tactics in a couple of months and therefore didn't have to serve the required 10 years the other North Koreans had to. In contrast to this fairytale we have records that not only put his birth in Russia, but paint him as a troubled youth who watched his own brother die drowning while he laughed. His name was also not \"Jung-il\" it was Yuri, a Russian name that his father made him abandon when they moved to Korea. \"Jung-il\" is a mixture of his father \"Il sung\" and his mother's \"Jung-suk\".

Cha: 9781458202161: Amazon.com: Books  8)  He segregated his economy into two sectors, one of which funds his  lavish lifestyle and the other the rest of the country. Of course he  took the best for himself, all Gold production and other profitable  companies were bundled together into this private economy while the  dregs were left for his people to squabble over. He uses his funds to  keep the military and high officials in luxury so that they remain  loyal, while the normal people starve.Exit Emperor Kim Jong-Il: Notes from His Former Mentor: John H.

He regarded James bond films as \"douc-dramas\" biased on real life. He however doesn't allow any foreign films to be seen in North Korea, Only propaganda films are allowed to be seen. This is how he controls the minds of his people.Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea: Barbara Demick: 9780385523912: Amazon.com: BooksA  Kim Jong-Il Production: The Extraordinary True Story of a Kidnapped  Filmmaker, His Star Actress, and a Young Dictator's Rise to Power: Paul  Fischer: 9781250054265: Amazon.com: Books 11) North Korea reports that its capitol \"has no disabled people\" and if a disabled person is born there they move \"of their own free will\" to another part of the country. Looking at other countries trying to create the \"perfect race\" such as  Germany, I don't doubt that something is being done to favor the perfect  children that North Korea seems so proud of.    North Korea's Secret 12) Celibacy was not only encouraged, it was mandatory.(only for the common people or prisoners however). If anyone was caught doing so much as holding hands they were punished or executed. When they reached marrying age (29 for girl 35 for boys) they enter a \"marriage lottery\" where a suitable partner was chosen for them. They enter into marriage with litterally no idea what women and men do in the marriage bed, because sex education is unheard of there. This is the way that the Kims controlled their population and made sure that their race remained pure.Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea: Barbara Demick: 9780385523912: Amazon.com: BooksThere are reports that this law is being loosened though and it is not as enforced as it once was.  It probably is still enforced in the prisoner camps however.http://www.nknews.org/2014/03/dating-in-north-korea/ 13) Some people ask why more people do not leave if conditions are so bad? The reason is simple, if anyone escapes their entire family and all of their friends will be tortured and then thrown into prison camps to regain their families \"honor\" If any one escapes they know this.  If they can be \"selfish\" enough to escape, they face exploitation and abuse at the Chinese border which is still friendly with North Korea and sends back any defectors. If they are not sent back they are threatened with it and agree to any working condition and any abuse in order to not be sent back.Escaping North Korea: one refugee's storyThe southern border with South Korea is the most heavily militarized zone on the planet, with 1,000,000 soldiers just on the southern side. Escape through this area is nearly impossible.     14)The reason we have not taken him out yet is because he is holding South Korea hostage.  If we tried to take him out he has enough firepower to wipe it off of the map, and as the country is blocked from mainland china by North Korea we could not evacuate the population effectively. To prove this fact every time that a son has taken the throne from his father they have launched several bombs to South Korea, just to prove that they can.  Even if we were able to do so, it is likely that the North Koreans would just choose another \"dear leader\" because they have been told without one, life would be meaningless.    This has been going on for 3 generations of dictators. None of them have been punished. The only way to end this atrocity is to educate the ordinary person. They need to learn that the outside of their small bubble is not the hell that they have been taught it is. Efforts to do this have been balloons with flyers and cd's etc, but so far they have not been effective enough. ",

            "answer_text": " The Duplessis Orphans were children victimized in a mid-20th century scheme in which approximately 20,000 orphaned children were falsely certified as mentally ill by the government of the province of Quebec, Canada, and confined to psychiatric institutions.The Catholic Church has denied the allegations, and disputes the claims of those seeking payments. In the 1950s, the premier of Quebec was Maurice Duplessis and he was a super-staunch Catholic. He decided that the Church should be the sole caretaker of the poor, alcoholics, orphans, and unwed mothers. Duplessis said he \u201ctrusted them completely\u201d and signed over responsibility of schools, orphanages, and hospitals to the Catholic Church. Well, there were a few problems with that plan. A lot of orphans were actually born to parents who weren\u2019t married, but the Church didn\u2019t approve so they were sent away. So not only were the orphanages fuller than they should\u2019ve been, but the Quebec government didn\u2019t get enough money to subsidize orphanages. They did a little math and found out they were getting $1.25 a day for orphans but $2.75 a day for psychiatric patients. Here\u2019s where it gets really screwed up: there was an old law called Loi sur les Asiles d\u2019ali\u00e9n\u00e9s (Lunatic Asylum Act) that said you could commit someone to an insane asylum for three reasons: to care for them, to help them, or a security measure to maintain social order. The doctors diagnosed the children with various mental illnesses while ignoring their actual mental state. Children in Quebec orphanages were therefore declared \"mentally deficient\". Schooling stopped, and the orphans became inmates in a mental institution where they were sexually, physically, and mentally abused by lay monitors and nuns. Children who complained about the conditions were sent to local reform schools. Seven religious orders participated: the Sisters of Providence, the Sisters of Mercy, the Gray Nuns of Montreal, the Sisters of Charity of Quebec, the Little Franciscans of Mary, the Brothers of Notre-Dame-de-la-Misericorde, and the Brothers of Charity. A commission in the early 1960s investigating mental institutions after Duplessis' death revealed one-third of the 22,000 patients did not belong. The B\u00e9dard report of 1962 put an end to the outdated concept of an \"asylum,\" while many of the orphans reached adulthood and could leave the facility. Years later, long after these institutions were closed, the children who had survived them and become adults began to speak out about the harsh treatment and sexual abusethey endured at the hands of some members of institutions and medical personnel. In a psychiatric study completed by one of the involved hospitals, middle-aged Duplessis Orphans reported more physical and mental impairments than the control group. In addition, the orphans were less likely to be married or to have a healthy social life. 80% reported they had suffered a traumatic experience between the ages of 7 to 18. Over 50% said they had undergone physical, mental, or sexual abuse. About 78% reported difficulty functioning socially or emotionally in their adult life. Legal recourse in the 1990s By the 1990s, there remained about 3,000 survivors and a large group formed to start a campaign. They called themselves the Duplessis Orphans after Maurice Duplessis, the Premier of Quebec during that time whose government was responsible for their plight. In addition to government and Church responsibility, the College of Physicians of Quebec came under fire after some of the orphans found copies of their medical records that had been falsified. Labelled as mentally deficient, many of these children were subjected to electroshock, a variety of drug testing and used in other medical experiments. Released upon reaching the legal age of maturity, they were uneducated and ill-equipped to cope with life as adults. At first, the government of Quebec stonewalled them, but after they started gaining widespread publicity in March 1999, the \u2018parti Quebecois\u2019 government made a token offer of approximately $15,000 as full compensation to each of the victims. The offer was rejected and the government was harshly criticized by the public and even the provincial Ombudsman, Daniel Jacoby, came out saying that the government's handling of the situation had trivialized the abuse, the victims alleged. Nevertheless, the government still refused to hold an inquiry. In 2001, the claimants received an increased offer from the Quebec government for a flat payment of $10,000 per person, plus an additional $1,000 for each year of wrongful confinement to a mental institution.The offer amounted to approximately $15,000 per orphan; however, it was limited to each of the surviving 1,100 orphans the government had labeled as mentally deficient, but did not include any compensation for victims of sexual or other abuse. The offer was accepted by those eligible while the remainder received nothing. The vote on the offer was taken by a show of hands in a closed-door session overseen by Committee chief, the author Bruno Roy, one of very few orphans who enjoyed a successful career following the traumatic experience of youth detention. The results of the vote were later bitterly contested by a group which believed the victims should have received more. The Quebec Government declined to prosecute the criminal cases.Opponents of the judgment led by Rod Vienneau of Joliette Quebec, pointed out that bureaucrats processing the applications for compensation were in many cases being paid over $1,000 per day of work,whereas the orphans themselves received the same amount for an entire year of their childhood confined illegally to insane asylums. The Catholic Church publicly announced that they played no responsibility in the orphans' situation and refused to apologize. The representative for the seven orders, Sister Gisele Fortier, called the allegations \"upsetting ... but very much sensationalized, and needs to be put into context.\" Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte, archbishop of Montreal, asserted that the religious orders \"deserve our respect and have a right to their good name.\" This offended many of the Duplessis Orphans. In 2006, one of the Orphans, Martin L\u00e9cuyer, stated \"it's important for me, that the church, the priests, that they recognize they were responsible for the sexual abuse, and the aggression. It's not for the government to set that peace ... It's an insult, and it's the biggest proof that the government is an accomplice of the church.\" Aftermath In 1999, Researchers L\u00e9o-Paul Lauzon and Martin Poirier issued a report arguing that the Quebec government and the Roman Catholic Church made substantial profits by falsely certifying thousands of Quebec orphans as mentally ill during the 1940s and 1950s. The authors made a conservative estimate that religious groups received $70 million in subsidies (measured in 1999 dollars) by claiming the children as \"mentally deficient,\" while the government saved $37 million simply by having one of its orphanages redesignated from an educational institution to a psychiatric hospital. A representative of a religious order involved with the orphanages accused the authors of making \"false assertions.\" Fate of the remains In 2004, members of the \"Duplessis Orphans\" asked the Quebec government to unearth an abandoned cemetery in the east end of Montreal which they believed held the remains of orphans who may have been the subject of medical experiments. According to testimony by individuals who were at the Cit\u00e9 de St-Jean-de-Dieu insane asylum, the orphans were routinely experimented upon and many died. The group wants the government to exhume the bodies so that autopsies may be performed.On December 13, 2015, a new interview with one of the survivors was conducted on RT. Justice was not done and criminal wrongdoing was allowed to go unpunished. [math]SOURCE:THOUGHT CATALOG [/math] ",
