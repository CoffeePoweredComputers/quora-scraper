            "answer_text": "What is society? Society is, simply put, a group of individuals living together in a community. The amount of people is irrelevant; what matters is that society is made up of you and the people living around you. You could consider all human life as one society, or you could consider all human life within a defined geographical region as one society. Government considers society to be the latter. Government is, on a basic level, \u201can institution through which society makes and enforces its public policies.\u201d Public policy is basically anything a government decides to do (such as taxing, declaring war, copyrighting, et cetera). Some forms of government have society vote directly to make and enforce public policies (i.e. a direct democracy), while others have one person represent society in making and enforcing public policies (i.e. a dictatorship). A State, in the sense I am referring to now, is not like the \u201cstate of New York\u201d or the \u201cstate of California.\u201d Rather, a State is the equivalent of a country or nation. So! For something to be considered a State, it must have four things: land (a defined geographical region), population (a society), government (as defined above), and sovereignty (the authority to rule without having to ask for permission). By this logic, the United States can be considered a State, while, say, ISIS cannot be considered a State, as ISIS lacks permanent, defined geographical borders. Ergo, the relationship between society, State, and government can be described by the following statement: society runs the State through the government. However, if the \u201cstate\u201d referred to in the question is not a \u201cState\u201d in terms of a \u201cnation\u201d or \u201ccountry,\u201d but rather, is a \u201cstate\u201d as a subdivision of the national government (i.e. the state of California or the state of New York), then a further understanding of government is required (for the sake of easily distinguishing the two types of states, I will capitalize the word \u201cstate\u201d when referring to a nation or country). There are three types of government: a unitary government, a federal government, and a confederate government. A unitary government consists of only one level of government, the national government. In this type of government, there are no states. Many States throughout the world use this type of government. Here, the relationship is as follows: society runs the government. In this form of government, there is no mediating state, so the state is not a part of the relationship between society and government. Including the State (capital \u201cS\u201d) in this description, the relationship would be as follows: society runs the State through the government (the original relationship, without taking states into account).A federal government consists of two levels of government, the national government and the state government. In this form of government, the national government takes precedence over the state government. State governments are run by the society within that individual state (be it directly or via representatives), while the national/federal government is run by representatives of the society within each state (this is how the United States government works). So the relationship here is the following: society runs the states and the government, but the states are limited by the government. If we include the State in this description, the relationship would be the following: society runs the State through the states and the government, but the states are limited by the government.A confederate government also consists of a national level and a state level, much like a federal form of government. However, the key difference here is that the state government takes precedence over the national government, the reverse of a federal form of government. State governments are run by the society within that individual state, either directly or through representatives. The national government is also run by society, but is only capable of doing what the state governments allow it to do. In essence, the relationship here is as follows: society runs the states and the government, but the government is limited by the states. If the State is included in the relationship, then the relationship is as follows: society runs the State through the states and the government, but the government is limited by the states.Ergo, the relationship between society, the state, the State (in this case, I\u2019ll refer to it as the nation), and the government in a unitary government is as follows: society runs the nation through the government. Moreover, the relationship between society, the state, the nation, and the government in a federal government is as follows: society runs the nation through the states and the government, but the states are limited by the government.

            "answer_text": "Normally, one state one government: if you have one government, more than one state, then it might be the United States (surprise !) or possibly the United Kingdoms (of England and Scotland- and a few other bits and pieces) or even Pakistan, that used to be East and West, before they split up and got an extra government in the East (and then a new name, Bangladesh.) The USSR is an also ran, possibly others. Otherwise you may just have a war on your hands: think of Korea (still at war after all these years - just an armistice between two governments, North and South) or Vietnam, or a \u201ccold war\u201d (Germany.) Society is a euphemistic term for a lot of people, possible the whole nation, possibly some idealised part of it - possibly a trans national or supranational congeries of people - who probably neither know nor care much about each other, but where some politicians want to stress some real or imagined coherence of purpose (politicians are always trying to tell \u201ctheir\u201d people what it is they want them to want) and identity of aims - and good luck with that. Usually another war is brewing. Society in reality is a matter of \u201cthe people you associate with\u201d - one way or another: family, neighbours, colleauges at work, parents of the children who go to school with your own brats, even the postman, if you get to see him often: often true out in the country. Thus your society is peculiar to you: mine is mine own. There are thus about seven billion different societies in the world, many of which have some degree of overlap (we call this a \u201cTown\u201d or a \u201cvillage\u201d or a \u201cneighbourhood\u201d) and thus we know people around us: but some much better than other - some quite distantly. I do not associate with my fellow countrymen - they are too numerous. I do not associate with my government: they are too odious. I do associate with you, my reader (s) (more than one ? sometimes \u2026) but only in the most distant and electronically connected way\u2026 but, in miniscule, THIS is society. ",
