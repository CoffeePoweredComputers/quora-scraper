            "answer_text": "No. Some people (including me) often use the term Persian interchangeably with Iranian. But, really, Persians are a subset of Iranians defined by culture, region, and genetics while Iranian includes a number of groups, Medes, Kurds, etc. not considered Persian. In Iran, the data is sketchy. Clearly the vast majority are Muslim and Shi\u2019ih Muslim. A significant minority is Sunni (or also Sufi) Muslim. In terms of other beliefs: Atheist and agnostic are most probably (by far) the largest and fastest growing non-Muslim beliefs (some suppressed or not openly declared in Iran, but many Persians/Iranians in the \u201cWest\u201d that have emigrated either openly or privately are no longer Muslims)Baha\u2019is are next largest. There are maybe 300,000+ remaining in Iran but once there may have been as many as 600,000+ in Iran before 1979. Many Baha\u2019is left Iran. Baha\u2019is were encouraged and warned to leave or at least move assets out prior to 1979. Over time before the Revolution some emigrated out of Iran, and many additionally have left over time (especially in the 1980s) such that there are many additional \u201cPersian\u201d Baha\u2019is outside of Iran (many now married to persons of other nationalities or second or even third generations since emigrating). Baha\u2019is are most heavily persecuted in Iran. See Persecution of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds - Wikipedia and the listed links to UN and international NGO reports.Christians (such as Armenian Orthodox in the Northwestern region and others) are probably next largest after Baha\u2019is but have been declining in numbers as well due to departures.A very small remnant of the Jewish community remains in Iran (most have now emigrated and some families had converted to the Baha\u2019i Faith beginning in the 1880s and progressively over time).A small remnant of Zoroastrians remain in Iran (large percentage converted to the Baha\u2019i Faith in the late 1800s and over time and others have emigrated, some to join Parsi communities in India and others left to \u201cWestern\u201d countries).There are small numbers of other religions such as Hindus, Buddhists, Yazidis, and Babi\u2019s also exist in Iran. (The Bab declared a religion in 1844 and had a significant following quickly develop but many were killed or persecuted and most of the remainder became Baha\u2019is. Maybe a thousand Babi\u2019s remain that did not become Baha\u2019is today, and many may not be identified publicly as Babi\u2019s.)",

            "answer_text": "MOST BUT NOT ALL. Most Persians are Shiite Muslims, but there are significant religious minorities among Persians. The largest minority of Persians are Sunni Muslims, especially those outside of Iran, such as the Persians in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. After the Muslims, the largest minority would have to be Atheists and Agnostics. While accurate numbers cannot be recorded since conversion out of Islam is illegal in Iran, there are certainly millions of Atheist Persians. Other Persian religious minorities include: Christians, both recent converts and long-time members of the Church. The most common forms of Christianity are Oriental Orthodoxy (Church of the East, Nestorianism, Armenian) and modern Protestantism (Evangelical and Episcopalian/Anglican)Zoroastrians, the historic religion of Persia, the largest number of Persian Zoroastrians is near the Fire Temples at Yazd (and in Teheran). There is another related religion of Mandaeanism.Jews, there are Persian Jews throughout the world, but primarily in the United States and IsraelBaha\u2019i, there are at least a few hundred Persian Baha\u2019i. There are also a few dozen thousand Azalis and Babis (which are related religions to Baha\u2019i)Yazadi and Ahl-e-Haqq, these are indigenous Kurdish faiths that some Persians practiceNote on Persian vs. Iranian Most people have been trying to correct you to use the term \u201cIranian\u201d instead of \u201cPersian\u201d. This may be incorrect. \u201cIranian\u201d is a national term. It refers to the country of Iran and its citizens. \u201cPersian\u201d is an ethnic term. It refers to the people who speak Farsi as a native language and engage in Persian culture. 61\u201365% of Iranians are Persians. Roughly half of Persians are Iranians (since Persian includes Tajiks in both Afghanistan and Tajikistan and ethnic Persians outside of the Middle East.) ",

            "answer_text": "As of right now, the situation with Islam is very complicated in Iran. There is no accurate statistical data which you can get a hold of. On paper/guesstimate, 95% of Iranians are Muslims but in reality, I would say that number has declined down to 70% and is continuing to decline based on the new people I meet and what I see and hear from Iranians on then internet. The Muslim clerics of Iran have even admitted to their failure of keeping the Iranians youth under Islam. They are bashing their heads against the wall because Iranians are converting to Christianity in hundreds of thousands and some are going back to Zoroastrianism. Many iranians I meet are agnostic and do not belong to a religion nor would want to which is what I am. Iran is known to have the highest number of underground Christian converts to prevent capital punishment. Its against the law in Iran for Iranians to openly convert to different religions other than Islam so many Iranians LIE about being Muslims to save themselves from certain death. Many Iranians who still consider themselves Muslims are not practicing muslims. The ones I know party, drink and eat pork. They don't care about the Islamic life style which doesn't make sense to any true Muslim. Its up to you to decide whether or not they're Muslim. Iran is also a massive country with different ethno cultures, there are Georgians, armenians and what not living all over Iran with their own religions. Not everyone in this country is a muslim ",

First, you're not allowed to convert to a religion other than Islam and there are strong insentives to dissuade you from claiming atheism openly as your personal preference. There are two major groups in Iran. One is the religious type who firmly identify with Shi'a Islam and views Iran as the world defender of this creed. The other group is what many call nationalists. Nationalists like to trace their heritage all the way back to the time of Cyrus the Great. Most nationalists I've met claim to be atheists. Many Iranians of all generations seem to be disillusioned by state sponsored religion to a certain extent. I think this is turning a lot of people away from their faith, even if you won't see it in any official study. And of course there are Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians who have a special immunity from a certain number of Islamic restrictions as long as they don't try to convert other people. There\u2019s also Baha'is , but don't tell anyone. ;-) ",

A smaller minority of Iranians adhere to the Baha\u2019i faith, others are Madeans, Yarsanis, Zoroastrians, Jews and Christians. But you also have to consider the fact that there are non-Persian Iranians, as well as the fact that there are non-Muslim Persians who either live in Iran (although the Iranian government doesn\u2019t recognize the existence of non-religious Iranians), as well as non-Muslim Iranians who practice other religions or no religion at all. There are people of Persian descent living all over the world from many different religious backgrounds, so it\u2019d be foolish to assume that they\u2019re all Muslim. ",

            "answer_text": "As an Iranian, I try to give a very simple and yet honest answer. There are no factual statistics to cite since you cannot carry out such studies under the current government. As an Iranian, you will easily lose your job, education, rights and privileges, if not your head, if you publicly say you\u2019re not a muslim. As for me, almost no close friend and familial individual that I know actually practices islam nor any other religion. However, a considerable number still fast during Ramadan and yet the number is decreasing quite rapidly. Many celebrate certain christian events, even though the state is highly against it. Overall, Persians are more passionate about their own culture and traditional values than with religious impulses and seem not to really care about it. ",
