            "answer_text": "For bronze in the early days you needed surface deposits easily worked with the very primitive mining technologies (hitting the rocks with other rocks, using hot and cold water to expand existing rock fractures, digging shallow holes, using campfires and then ceramics kilns/ovens to roast the ores) that were naturally and unusually pure copper and alluvial tin (like placer gold accumulated in streams in noticeable quantities in only a few places on Earth) that are very close to each other (Thailand, Wales, Bolivia, and few others) along with lots of trees for charcoal-based heat or even surface deposits of coal. So it takes a rare confluence of the materials to make early bronze. Copper occurs in several types of rock, generally needing to be crushed, smelted with considerbale expertise, refined often with other chemicals and minerals, and often deep underground so most of the world\u2019s copper deposits were unavailable for most of history (the big breakthroughs are in the 1880\u2019s-1990\u2019s.) Copper around the Great Lakes is the world\u2019s purest and didn\u2019t need to be smelted or refines as well as being easily worked surface deposits. That was being tapped by at least 4,000 years ago and the amount of copper removed over roughly a 1,000 years of very intense mining by hundreds to thousands of miners doesn\u2019t show up in North America but does \u201ccoincide\u201d with the vast appetite for copper during the Bronze Age of the Meditterranean and has turned up in a Minoan shipwreck off Turkey\u2019s coast from that era as well as in an old trading port on the West Indian coast, abandoned long before Columbus. Tin unfortunately wasn\u2019t available closer than the American Southwest, Bolivia, or Wales in easy surface deposits so the lack of livestock to pull wagons and river barges was an insuperable challenge for bronze in North America. There\u2019s lots of iron ore available and even key alloying elements (molybdenum and nickel along the St. Lawrence River, metallurgical coal and hardwood forests in the Northeast and Southeast, etc. but it\u2019s not noticeably tapped until the 19th Century or 300 years after massive European colonization. A know-how gap essentially. ",

Jared Diamond\u2019s \u201cGuns, Germs, and Steel\u201d gives a splendid picture of this question and its answer. Spoiler alert: he ties it ultimately to geography- Eurasia oriented east west versus the Americas being north south, so crops and animals were more easily developed in Eurasia. ",
