            "answer_text": "I wondered whether I should still contribute something to this, but the topic is near and dear to my heart. At first, there was no distinction between veterans and everyone else. Towards the end of the war, the country had a near 100% conscription rate for men between 16 and 60. Nearly everybody was in the war, and who wasn't witnessed the downfall in their own neighborhoods, with bombing raids and allied occupation troops in every part of Germany besides the most rural areas. Every man that was still alive - we lost a tenth of our population, and every sixth man was dead, captured or maimed - was a veteran, or had to be able to explain why he wasn't. Women worked our industry and anti-aircraft batteries during the war, because every man that could hold a gun was sent east or west to fight a lost and wrong cause. After the war, the country suffered from collective PTSD. I am sure some of you have friends or family, or maybe yourself, that have been in Iraq or Afghanistan, and maybe have witnessed the devastating effect of the mental disorders that come with fighting a war. Now, I mean absolutely no offense and do not mean to diminish the suffering of today's veterans - but the conflicts fought today are pretty much children's birthday parties if compared to the world igniting horror of World War II. Imagine a whole population having experienced this, with no such thing as psychological counseling or even just psychiatric medication. We were a broken, defeated, extinguished people in 1945. 60 million human beings suffering from PTSD. And knowing that not only did you lose the war, but also that you were on the wrong side. On the wrong side of morality, of humanity, of history. We were the bad guys. There was no pride. Just the knowledge that we were at rock bottom, and rightfully so. So no, there was no special treatment for veterans. Just the comfort those that experienced the war together were able to give to each other. Telling stories to children, who after the economic miracle of the 1950s and 60s (in no small part made possible by the Marshal plan and the open arms of the international community) already had no possible understanding for what had just a couple of years ago happened. And then the 60s were coming to their end, and the children born after the war were coming of age. And they started to ask questions. You see, after the war, nobody had done anything really bad. Sure, some had, and they hanged in Nuremberg. But me? No, of course not! I wasn't in the SS! I was just doing what we had to do in war! That was the sentiment of everyone who was in the war. And it just did not add up. 20 million people don't just die by themselves. The question: \"What did you do during the war?\" became the central crux for the relationship between two generations. And where the answers were dissatisfying, it broke. The student protests of 1968 and the following left-wing terrorism by the RAF during the 70s came up mostly because a young generation was horrified and angry that a generation of murderers still held power in the young Bundesrepublik. Veterans were not honored outside the circles of the Ewig-Gestrigen, they were silently loathed. By now, the last veterans of the war are dying. If you were conscripted in the last days of the Battle of Berlin, you are today at least 80 years old. My generation - I turned 30 this year - knows of the war only from stories of our grandparents, and from the ever-present historic reminders. In no other country on Earth will you be taught as much about Nazi Germany in schools, or see as many documentaries about it on TV, or have it so ingrained into our culture and arts. My generation knows; but while most people can get very angry with their parents, it is hard to be the same way with your old grandpa. The sentiment has changed once more. My mother's father was an anti-aircraft gunner, he was captured in France and spent the last months of the war in an American POW camp near Boston. He got lucky by having an inguinal hernia just in time to avoid being sent to the eastern front earlier. My father's father was a tank driver, in a very small, hardly armored Sch\u00fctzenpanzer on the eastern front. He told stories of how they would fell trees and pull them on chains behind their tank, so that the enemy would think their tank to be much bigger. He got captured by the Red Army in the winter of '45, and told stories of how their guards would start burning parts of the POW camp's buildings for warmth. He got lucky, and fled in a daring escape, that probably sounded much more adventurous in his stories than in reality. My granduncle was in the SS. He joined the nazi party in the 20s. He was an SA officer, and then an SS officer, and then he fell on the retreat from Treblinka. Good riddance. Good riddance not only of the few people of that time that deserved the downfall and their own demise. But good riddance of the very idea that they fought for. The propaganda. The militarism. The heroism. The love of people and country that turned into hate for everything else. And, yes, the glorification of the soldier and the veteran. We shed ourselves of this, and we paid a unimaginable price for it (and, even more so, made others pay it for us). By being the most mentally disturbed people in the world at one time in history, we might now, after decades of self-administered psychotherapy, be one of the most sane. ",

            "answer_text": "All the men were WWII vets. Everyone in the age group was drafted into the regular military, and the people outside the age group were drafted into the Volkssturm militias. My grandfather was/is physically disabled from birth, and was u.k (an exemption from the draft for skilled workers who\u2019's skills were deemed indispensable for the war effort). He was drafted despite this exemption. Twice. He managed to get medically discharged both times because of his crippled hand before his units were sent to their deaths. The Nazi official trying to send him to his death got so fed up with him getting back out that he drafted his 40 year old older brother instead (also supposed to be u.k.), just in time to get him sent to a French PoW camp. He nearly starved to death there. He was on the brink when he came back. It\u2019s literally a generation. It\u2019s not a group within that generation, and it\u2019s not like most of them volunteered. The ones who did died long before war's end.  They are not celebrated or condemned, because it wasn\u2019t a service, and it wasn't an ideological group, they weren\u2019t patriots, and they weren\u2019t warmongers, or anything else like that. All it took to be a German WWI veteran was to be one was be alive and be male. Anyone in Germany who fits those two criteria is more likely to have participated than not. \u02dc18 million fought for Germany. The population was \u02dc70 million, which makes about 35 million males total in the country, a substantial portion of which were children, because the population pyramid of the time was an actual pyramid. It\u2019's about 1/4 in modern America, and it would have been about 1/3 back then, meaning there were probably around 21 million adult males in all of Germany. 18 million of those fought. 86%. About 10 million became casualties, and 11 million were imprisoned in camps (That cannot be called PoW camps because the Allies refused them this legal designation). They were PoW\u2019s in every logical sense but denied this status to avoid having to meet Geneva Convention standards to feed them. When they started starving to death in large numbers most of them were released to avoid a more extreme humanitarian disaster. It was a collective trauma that every male over the age of 16 in Germany at the time went through. And that's how we see them. Just people. ",
