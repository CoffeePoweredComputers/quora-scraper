            "answer_text": "Historically speaking, Western Philosophy generally traces its origins to Thales of Miletus, a Greek living in Asia Minor in the 7th c. BCE. Thales studied all sorts of subjects, from astronomy to mathematics to agriculture and meteorology, and was well known in his home town for being very bright and curious. But he didn\u2019t seem concerned with anything practical. Supposedly he was once teased by an Aristocrat for being poor, which the Aristocrat suggested meant he didn\u2019t know anything, or at least that everything he knew was useless. So Thales did what any good philosopher does when someone teases him about having studied useless things: he went into business. He realized there would a huge olive harvest one year and promptly bought up all the olive presses. Sure enough, the olive crop was bountiful, and suddenly he was able to charge whatever he wanted for people to use the presses. He made a fortune, but it was all just to prove a point: that he knew things, and that they could be useful, but that his concern wasn\u2019t with riches or power. He just wanted to be wise and know stuff, for its own sake, regardless of practical concerns. A second story picks up on this point: one day he\u2019s just wandering around, looking at the sky, pondering the nature of reality, and falls into a well because he\u2019s not looking where he\u2019s going. A passing slave girl has to help him get out. Once he\u2019s been saved she promptly teases him about knowing everything about the heavens, but nothing about what\u2019s under his feet. What this story makes clear is something the other might obscure: for Thales, and those that would follow him, theoretical knowledge can be useful, practically speaking, but it\u2019s valuable in itself even if pursuing it can be practically detrimental. And it\u2019s this idea that allows the Greeks to give birth to a rich philosophical tradition without being great engineers or having a burgeoning civilization like the Babylonians and Egyptians. Like Thales, the Greek philosophers valued learning and wonder even when it didn\u2019t have an immediate practical purpose. Thales is also well known for his claim that \u201cEverything is really water,\u201d and this makes the point clear, for it\u2019s hard to imagine a practical application to the claim that all things are made of water! And as wild as it may sound, it makes some sense if you think about it: you plant a seed and it grows when you water it; you deprive a man of water and he dies. But whether this idea makes perfect sense or not, it also makes clear that Thales things were not exactly as they appear (really it\u2019s all water) and that if we thought carefully enough about it we could eventually come to understand things as they really are. So Thales gives us the first instance the distinction between appearance and reality, the basis of the phrase \u201cthings are not always what they seem.\u201d Thales was the first person to take that kind of leap, and while the Egyptians, Bablyonians, and other peoples at the time didn\u2019t seem to be pursuing those kinds of questions, those Greeks that followed Thales thought deeply about the hidden causes behind the appearances of things; but importantly, they wanted to know these things just because they were curious, not because they thought it would be useful in any way. So the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom for their own sake, really, is the start of philosophy. Aristotle himself (who is often referred to simply as \u201cThe Philosopher\u201d) says as much, identifying Thales\u2019s concern with understanding the reality behind the appearances as the starting point of all philosophical thinking.

            "answer_text": "Thales of Miletus is widely considered the first \"western\" philosopher. He lived in the 7th century in Asia Minor, in one of the Greek city-states that bordered Persia known collectively as Ionia, and was the first person that we know of in any civilization, eastern or western, to say that natural phenomena were caused by, well, natural forces, rather than by the gods. Before Thales, somebody might say that an earthquake was caused by Poseidon's anger. Thales suggested that Poseidon in his anger shook the water that the earth floated in, thereby disturbing the earth's equilibrium, which then caused an earthquake. So in some ways he was much more the first scientist than the first philosopher. But he was essentially the first person to say, well, what if we've been wrong all along about X? He established what's called the Ionian School of philosophy, which was continued by his student Anaximander and by his student Anaximenes, and so on and so on. Eventually this way of doing things came to Athens, where Socrates picked it up a couple of centuries later. (Note that Confucius and the Buddha lived around the same time as Socrates, and so are also post-Ionian School. There are of course other eastern philosophers from before that time, but I'd be out of my depth trying to discuss them.) ",

            "answer_text": "One way to see it is that it began with myths, which expressed the principles of philosophy in ways that were understood at a subconscious level. Gradually these \u2018interior truths\u2019 were articulated explicitly and integrated with the rational mind. The myths sprung forth from the human collective conscious: Nature itself wishes human beings to become philosophers. ",

            "answer_text": "Philosophy began in the 6th Century BEC in ancient Greese. The first philosophers known as Prescocrotics gave way to this movement. Thales, often referred to as the first Western philosopher, to Stolics and Skeptics opened tbe doors to a particular train of thought that provides us with the roots of Western intellectual traditions. The Milesian thinkers provided theories of indivisible and invisible units as the basis of all matter. Socrates inquired into ethical matters while Plato addressed issues of political thought, metaphysics and epistemology. Aristole, tbe most prolific of authors, wrote of the investigation into our natural worlsd including the composition of animals. ",
