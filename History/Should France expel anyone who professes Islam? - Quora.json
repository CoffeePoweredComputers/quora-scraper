            "answer_text": "TL;DR: your 'proposition' is absurd, impossible, against every law (French, European and International) and against humanity in its simplest form.  All the premises of your question are skewed: Islam and secularism go along fine, thanks; ask the (silent) majority of French Muslims, who preach adherence to the laws of the French Republic, and who say 'we're French, we're under attack';France didn't ban headscarves; but covering your face entirely is forbidden (burqa), and rightfully so: if I walked in the street with a balaklava I would get arrested! (hm, these days I might get a bullet actually);A permanent underclass?? They're working, paying taxes, sending their kids to school... like for all immigrants (maybe more so) it takes time to climb the social ladder, and the economic crisis doesn't help, but they do integrate --contrarily to what sensationalist media constantly pummel us with... And immigrants' kids succeed better at school than their 'Gaul' equivalents: the integration machine does work (could work better; what doesn't?).No one wants to force kids to eat pork; and you still have a majority of schools with pork-free menus, and other schools who provide vegetarian menus for all;Muslims in France are... 7 million? And you keep talking about 2,000 extremists (0.02%)... Is Timothy McVeigh your view of a standard US citizen???Do you think France is the origin of ISIS? (do you believe in the Illuminati too?).French citizens have a right to live in France; most of the \"Muslims\" you're talking about are French citizens, most by birth, actually, they don't come from anywhere else, you couldn't \"send them back\" anywhere, they belong here.",
