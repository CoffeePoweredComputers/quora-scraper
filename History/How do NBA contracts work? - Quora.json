            "answer_text": " Okay, time to break down the paperwork that precedes the high flying displays of athleticism and jaw dropping talent witnessed by fans around the globe on a nightly basis during the NBA season. The NBA\u2019s total yearly revenue has been around $6 billion for the last 2 years. Players, per the collective bargaining agreement are entitled to 51% of basketball related income, so about $3 billion are going to the players. Additionally, there are 491 players in the league.So, 3,000,000,000/491, everyone gets about $6.1 million in salary, right? Well, kind of. The current average salary in the NBA is $6.4 million, but this is a tad misleading. Obviously, some players get paid more than others, and rightfully so. A Lebron James clearly deserves more money than a Lance Stephenson. Both provide value in their own respect, but undoubtedly on different levels. Regardless, after all is said and done, everyone gets a piece of the pie. Their pieces, however, vary in size.Next, we need to understand how we decide the exact amount of money that one player makes in comparison to his teammate.*Enter the NBA Salary cap* The salary cap is the limit to the total amount of money that teams are allowed to pay their players. It is a regulatory tool to ensure that teams are on a financially level playing field and one cannot spend their way to an elite, championship roster. In the most general sense, it is calculated as a percentage of the leagues revenue and the percentage is determined by players, owners, and others during the leagues collective bargaining agreement (CBA).For instance, the salary cap for NBA teams in 2017\u20132018 was $99 million dollars. So a team can break up that $99 million across a 12-15 man roster. It is important, however, to remember that this is a yearly limit and that contracts often exceed one year, making it increasingly important for General Managers to be able to plan and budget for the future.However, players can still take pay cuts and play wherever they want for below market value to try and win a championship by playing with other great players. Currently, there is no great policy in the NBA to protect against these occurrences.There are various other implications and details regarding contracts, there structures, and clauses/loopholes involved. However, this is the basic outline of how NBA contracts operate and why salaries are set at the levels they are. Hopefully this was helpful. Want my best NBA content?
