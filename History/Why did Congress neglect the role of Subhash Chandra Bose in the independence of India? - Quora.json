            "answer_text": "Only the leaders who feared that Netaji would become a great leader and they will be down and given less importance neglected him by saying that he is following Non- violence... Its to correct the question because congress had not neglected Netaji... Only some selfish leaders... Because Netaji had a full support of congress bottom followers... Only the leaders at the top who feared on Netajis growth neglected him not all..... Netaji had a full support from congress supporters (Netaji won the congress election by defeating the person who was supported by Gandhiji and became the president of congress) only the haters tried to remove him and too succeed(only netaji cake out of the party not the congress throwed him out because they knew bee well if they do so they will be in trouble) ... But they failed to remove Netaji from Indians Mind Some leaders tried to neglect Netaji because they don't want Netaji to be in high position and they don't want to down their position and they don't like Netajis growth which affected their prestige A real hero cannot be neglected hence he came out on his own and formed INA.. Netaji gained more supporters than the congress party.. That proves his strength and power among the people... True never dies A living god in Indians mind (Netaji the Real Hero) ",

            "answer_text": "They saw him as a hostile entity. From the time that he defied Gandhi, stood for election as Congress President and won, it was clear that he was hostile to Gandhi and all who followed him, some following him blindly, some following him in spite of severe reservations about his decisions. Second, his basic policies were rooted in authoritarian attitudes. He wanted anything but democracy, and apparently wanted some form of unquestioned obedience to an autocrat (guess who!) for a few years after gaining independence. Third, that itself, the gaining of independence, was a matter on which his strategy and that of the Congress diverged widely. He was looking for a military solution; the Congress, the opposite. ",
