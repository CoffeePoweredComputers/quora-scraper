            "answer_text": "Not bland at all. Indeed, even common people ate food that was tasty and delicious most of the times. This had much to do with the fact that they had use of fresh and tasty vegetables picked in season and straight from the greengarden. And don't start me on the bread made from well proofed dough and baked in woodburning ovens. A typical medieval meal would be a stew made by frying bacon in a pan, in the bacon fat you would soften onions and diced carrots. Then you would brown some poultry meat in the same pan. Now, transfer everything to a clay pot, hang it over a wood fire (which adds a hint of smokyness), and add water or stock, diced vegetables, root vegetables (no potatoes), herbs such as thyme and rosemary, and a pich of salt. Simmer over the fire for an hour or two until the stew is thick and flavorful. Serve with still slightly warm, crunchy bread, a glass of wine, ale, cider, or mead, and finish off your meal with a fresh fruit straight from the tree, a fruit compote, or some nuts. That is eating!

            "answer_text": "Interesting question. With a very sad premise. And kind of wrong. You see, Europeans didn't have some ingredients that we do today. But they typically used a much Fuller degree of the plants we ignore today. There are whole YouTube series showing the various recipes from the middle ages, and how they used spices etc. In contrast, I tried to find a calorie count for an easily grown resource the other day and none of my diet and fitness apps had any clue. I had to jump into the depths of the interwebs to find a source. Even Google tried to correct me. I grow a small garden. Last year I grew radishes, carrots, lettuce, pumpkin etc. And when it came time to pull the radishes I found they had no roots and instead had grown pea pods. It's called bolting, it happened because they got too hot too soon. But I dived into the internet to find out if they were edible. Turns out you can eat the roots, the pods, AND the leaves. So , next I looked into carrot greens. They grow so much greens that it seemed a waste. And that's where the Google God's nearly failed me. I tried to find out the nutrition profile of carrot greens. Google kept correcting me \u201cdo you mean carrots?\u201d Finally found it. Recipes were so much easier. And our ancestors ate a LOT more of all kinds of greens. Because they were cheap and easy. ",
