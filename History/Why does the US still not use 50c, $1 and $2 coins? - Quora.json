            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no such thing as a US $2 coin in the first place, so that solves that. There used to be a gold coin for $2.50, but those (along with all gold coins) were withdrawn in the 1930s. The latest attempt with $1 coin didn\u2019t catch on because the US still produces a $1 banknote, and people prefer those out of habit. The only way for $1 coins to see widespread use is by discontinuing the dollar bill (the way Canada did in the 1980s). The 50 cent piece all but disappeared from circulation in the late 1960s, where after dimes and quarters were switched from silver to nickel and copper, halves were still partly silver for a few more years. By the time they too were adjusted to the same copper/nickel blend as smaller coins, they had been gone from daily circulation long enough to never catch back on. Use dropped even more after the failed Eisenhower dollar, where Americans were less inclined to carry and use large coins. Since 2002 or \u201803, they\u2019ve only been minted to meet collector demand. ",

            "answer_text": "We still use half dollars and dollar coins in our cash registers and I use them for tips and small purchases. Perhaps you've not noticed but the U. S. has not made a $2 coin which would explain why it is not used. Personally I think the U.S. should scrap the one cent piece (usually wrongly called a penny, which is British) and the paper dollar but inertia is extremely difficult to overcome. ",
