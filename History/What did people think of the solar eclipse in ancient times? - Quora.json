            "answer_text": "It depended on the particular ancient peoples. By the time of Alexander the Great (4th century), Hellenistic people understood exactly what was going on. Here\u2019s an example with a lunar, rather than solar eclipse: While Alexander was waging war on the Persian Empire, a lunar eclipse occurred. This very much demoralized the Persians, who took the Moon as their emblem, and Alexander credited his victory to the eclipse. So he made thank offerings to the Moon \u2026 and the Sun and the Earth. He would not have included the Sun and Earth if he had not understood that the Moon was lit by the Sun and, during an eclipse, fell into the Earth\u2019s shadow. It is also religiously interesting to note that, despite understanding the perfectly natural causes of the eclipse, he still made thank offerings to Earth, Sun, and Moon. ",

            "answer_text": "Ancient people didn't really understand that the Earth revolved around the Sun and the Moon revolved around the Earth. Prior to Copernicus, most people thought the Earth was the center of everything, so they made up myths to explain both lunar and solar eclipses. The Vedic civilization of ancient India had a particularly interesting explanation for solar eclipses. All the Vedic gods were at a banguet, and they were eating Amrit, the food of the gods that made them immortal. Unbeknownst to them, a serpent had snuck in and eaten some of the Amrit. Immediately, he was cut in two, but too late, he was now immortal, and he became Rahu and Ketu, the moon's north and south nodes. According to the Vedas, a solar eclipse happened when one of the nodes started eating the Sun. Ironically, this isn't too far from the truth, because we now know that a solar eclipse can only happen when the moon is at its nodes, which are mathematical points in the sky. ",
