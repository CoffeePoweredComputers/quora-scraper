            "answer_text": "QUESTION \u201cWhat is the legacy of former U.S. Vice President Elbridge Gerry?\u201d ANSWER Gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is a practice used by legislatures who are charged with redistricting a state to balance the population served by its members.  This is a painting of Elbridge Gerry (1744\u20131814), who was a Congressman and finally, our fifth Vice President. It was necessary because of population shifts to redraw the legislative district boundaries. The party controlling the legislature also controlled the redistricting, so it produced an odd-looking map that party members thought would be more favorable to them. A famous cartoon appeared in a newspaper in 1812 and made fun of the district\u2019s odd shape, which some thought resembled a salamander. \u201cNot a salamander, \u201c goes the joke, \u201cit\u2019s a Gerry-mander.\u201d  Gerrymandering persists to this day.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez represents NY-14, which looks like some guy is kicking the crap out of Marmaduke.  Michigan-13 The Hydra is represented by Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). ",
