            "answer_text": "As an American, and therefore, on the outside looking in- I can only relate what an old Ostpreu\u00dfischer told me once, when I asked him about it. He said, \u201cImagine how you would feel if the U.S. lost a war, and lost the whole eastern seaboard, all of its original colonies, most of its historical landmarks, yet somehow kept its sovereignty. When the citizens are allowed to go back and see the old lands (as tourists), all of the landmarks are simply not there anymore- gone, like they never existed. Gravesites, war memorials, all gone. Gettysburg- the graves, and all the monuments, gone. Just another cow pasture. Smaller towns razed to the ground. In the Capitol, Washington DC, all of the old Gov\u2019t buildings are gone or unrecognizable. That is how it feels.\u201d The Soviets undertook a campaign of total erasure immediately after World War 2, with the express intent of removing any trace of German culture from that region- this included East Prussia, Upper and Lower Silesia, Bohemia-Moravia, and so on. These were traditionally German lands, for centuries. In fact, although not a lot of people realize it, Prussia was instrumental in creating the modern German nation. The Soviets knew that, and so they pursued this campaign with gusto. Consequently, very, very little evidence remains of Germans ever having been there. Fast forward to today, and it really isn\u2019t surprising that Germany acts collectively the way that it does. Many people point to Germany\u2019s lack of collective national pride, and call into question the attitudes of the citizenry, and the policies of their government, saying that many of the unpleasant things happening in Germany today are the result of Germans refusing to \u201cstand up for themselves\u201d. Now, to what degree it may be true is up for debate. But the reasons are clear- Loss of national pride through defeat in two world warsCollective guilt (to this day) for perpetrating some of the worst crimes against humanity in historyVery little in the way of physical institutions and tangible landmarks to remind them of the time of Germany\u2019s formation, and its times of greatness- in martial prowess, in art, and in culture- because of the loss of their national cradle, essentiallyAnd, most importantly, political correctness. Only now are Germans truly attempting to ask the important question- \u201cwhy?\u201d- and getting answers from that generation, which is dying off as fast as our WW2 vets- because up until recently, they hardly ever spoke of it, by and large- and no one was really asking them. This includes the media, which is only now beginning to deal with it, in the objective sense. For decades, this was a very taboo subject, and when it was examined, it was a very one-sided affair.(A note on #4 as well, from the American side- people outside of Germany are also starting to realize that everyone- and I mean everyone- got their hands dirty during the war. The truth does not reflect the commonly recycled themes and images of spotless, heroic G.I.s killing \u201cdirty kraut\u201d bad guys like Hollywood portrayed it for generations- the Allies did some horrible things to Germany, and not just the Soviets- both during and after the war.) Therefore, almost four generations of Germans don\u2019t feel or notice an absence of the eastern lands, because many of them were forced to forget, and very little evidence remains to remind them. Some may lament it, others may rejoice in it. But, those are the facts. ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes I meet Germans aged 50 who have never been born in the territories that the Germans lost after 1945. These older people in the age of 50 emphasize that they have regret for the losted their Heimat and can not feel in these areas that are in Poland since 73 years as in their own Heimat. I have a question how Poles should feel in such situation ? In this situation, do Poles also have the right to feel as at own home in own homeland ? Do Poles have the right to rule in their own country according to the interest of Polish society? Do Poles have no right to their homeland ? See what was Polish - German relations since Middle Ages . German colonization started in Poland before 1300 . They were immigrants and largely German-dialect speaker settlers.Before the 13th century almost all Polish towns had Magdeburg-style municipal institutions. The governing classes in these towns were increasingly German and German-speaking.The Ostsiedlung in Silesia was initiated by Boles\u0142aw I from Piast dynasty and by his son Henry I and his wife Hedwig (Saint Hedwig of Silesia) and they became the first Slavic sovereigns outside the Holy Roman Empire to promote German colonisation on a wide base. But situation changed when Poland deafeated The Teutonic state in Prussia, populated by German settlers beginning in the 13th century . During the reign of the Piasts (c. 940-1370), the first Polish dynasty created a unique in Europe national defense system caused by the devastation of the Mongol invasion. While in western Europe the defense system was based on and alliance between the monarch and the fortified towns, in Poland the towns were full of German and other immigrants who often rebelled against the King of Poland, who had to depend on a then unique alliance of the throne with landowners. This fact led to creation in Poland of a \u201cnoble nation of free citizens,\u201d of about 10% of the population while in the West nobility represented less than 1% of royal subjects.Polish Noble Nation was in over 90% Slavic origin and was composed approximately in 40% of ethnic Poles, 25% Ruthenians, 15% Bialorussians, 10% of Lithuanians and 5% Baltic Germans , Tatars , Karaims , Scots . The Noble Nation of Poland pioneered civil right in Europe while the Madna Carta Libertatum was forgotten for several centuries. All German settlers still didn\u2019t have German identity and gradually over three generations, they stopped using the German language. They prefered to use Polish language in united Poland . Germany were united later in 1871 . The victory against Drang nach Osten was made possible because Poland initiated voluntary union of the states threatened by the German Teutonic Knights.The first voluntary union of states Poland and Lithuania was concluded at Krewo in 1385. It eventually led to the formation of the largest territory in Western Christianity by the union of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuanian-Ruthenia. It is significant that the Gand Duchy used the Belorussian as its official language. Reunification of Germany at the expense of Poland's destruction German colonisation in Poland was coninued after \"Partitions of Poland \"(1772-1795) initiated by King of Prussia, Federic II (1712-1786) made Prussia by far the largest territory among over 350 independent states and principalities in Germany, which had been fragmented for centuries. Chancellor Otto Bismark, in the second half of the XIX century, revived the memories of the German genocide of the Balto-Slavic Prussians in the XIII century . Bismarck repeatedly likened the Poles to wolves, which should be \u201cshot to death, whenever possible.\u201d In 1861 he declared. \u201cHit Poles till they despair for their lives\u2026 if we are to survive, our only course is to exterminate them.\u201d (Werner-Richter, \u2018Bismarck,\u2019 New York: Putnam Press, 1964. p. 101.) After German defeat in WWII Bismarck\u2019s grandson publicly apologized in Poland for the genocidal plans of the first chancellor of the short-lived German Empire in which Chancellor Bismarck planned the extermination of the Poles in written documents signed by him. The partitions of Poland made the Kingdom of Prussia dominant in Germany then fragmented into over 350 independent small kingdoms and principalities of which Prussia was by far the largest. After the partitions of Poland in 1795 nearly 70% of the population of the Kingdom of Prussia, consisted of ethnic Poles unfamiliar with the German language. For this reason the ambitious Berlin government devised all kinds of dehumanizing routines in its boot camps in which ethnic Poles were to learn to obey German commands in order to be useful in German military service and help in realization of Berlin\u2019s ambition to dominate in Europe . Kulturkampf's policy was against the Polish ethnic group in the Prussian state.Mass displacement of the ethnically Polish population on the pretext of illegals . Poles faced increasing discrimination on formerly Polish lands. The first mass deportation of 30,000 Poles from territories controlled by the German Empire took place in 1885 Prussian deportations - Wikipedia The international crime of the Partitioning of Poland, led to the extraordinary growth of megalomania within the Berlin government and eventually to its plans to create German ( Prussian ) empire from Rhine River to Vladivostok to dominate the world. The crime of partitioning of Poland initiated by Prussia, reshaped Europe and eventually led to both World Wars, each time to the disastrous defeat first of the German Empire and then to the defeart of Hitler\u2019s Germany at the beginning of the nuclear age.  Partitions of Poland - Wikipedia Interwar period after regaining Polish independence in 1918 . During interwear period there wasn\u2019t coercion towards Germans who opted for German citizenship. They have to emigrate to Germany according to article 3 of treaty Versailles.  Amount of the 101 500 Germans voluntary opted for German citizenship until 1925 . This can be perceived as continuation of \u201cOstflucht \u201c. Through 1907 2.300.000 people emigrated from Prussians eastern region including 600 000 ethnic Poles. Ostflucht - Wikipedia Occupation of Poland The genocide \u201cIntelligenzaktion\u201d started in 1939 and genocide Polish citizens was continued later as \u201c the generalplan ost \u201c Intelligenzaktion - Wikipedia See Special Special Prosecution Book-Poland - Wikipedia lists of 60,000 targets in Intelligenzaktion. Expulsion Germans after WW2 It has been proved that from 1945, 473,000 Germans and pre-war German citizens, including Poles, lost their lives due to various reasons, such as illness, hunger, death from cold, death marches at the orders of German authorities, robberies by deserters and stay in Soviet camps resettlement. These data were confirmed by historians who participated in the 1990s in the Polish-German history program of \"expellees\", critically verifying the number of 2 million deaths reported in Germany as untrue, and accepting the estimates of the German Federal Archives of 1974, 400,000, as the closest truth. deaths on land incorporated into Poland and the USSR without German evacuation victims led by the German authorities and escapes from the front, taking place before the takeover of these territories by both countries, of which about 200,000 were victims of deportation to the USSR. a. There were only about 3 milions* of Germans on Polish territory (including lands before Odra-Nysa line) after German capitulation in 1945 and many of them had to back to Germany because in other way there would be no \u201cexpeled\u201d (Vertriebene) movment in Germany after war so it\u2019s imposible that \u201c3 millions were slaughtered/perished during this ethnic cleanse.\u201d***According to population census from 1946.**According to Polish and German specialists 60,000 Germans died in Polish Work Camps , 40,000 in Soviet ones and 120,000 were victimes of usually Red Army\u2019s crimes. b. It\u2019s senseless to kill free work force or de facto state slaves which were citizens of III Reich before 1945. Polish Folk Republic weren\u2019t Nazi Germany, there were no racial policy. Yes, there was presure on removing Germans from new Polish lands but after 1946 it became weaker with every year. Polish Work Party started treat Germans who stayed in Poland as some kind of alive war reparation and future Polish people after forced polonization.Germans especialy specialists were usefull for Polish Volk Republic\u2019s economy and because of that communists couldn\u2019t let them to Germany.Polish state never killed intentional any German who wasn\u2019t Nazi or enemy of folk. c. In 8 January 1951 all Germans on Polish territory gained Polish citizenship. There were about 1 milion of Germans in Polish Volk Republic in that time according to population census in 1950.Look at map which based on population census from 1950 and see how big procent of pre-war population stayed on new Polish lands.  d. Even today there is German minority in Poland. They have one seat in Sejm (Parlament). Number of Germans decrease because of emigration to Germany. In 2002 ther were 152.897 Polish Germans and in 2011 there were 147.814 of them however there is about 20.000 German imigrants in Poland today. Poland and some part of Africa were colonized by Germany in past ins similiar way as was done towards to China during XIX and on begining XX century.During Soviet ocupation of Poland Polish economy betweeen the years 1970 - 1979 was the 8th economic power, which means that Poland was more sovereign than after 2004 when Poland entered to the European Commonwealth .During the period between 1993 and 2015 , Poland lost 6 million jobs as accession requirements in 2004 to European Commonwealth ( and EU in 2009 ) .

            "answer_text": "Hum\u2026I never thought much about it. Germany lost considerable about of land to the east at the end of WWII to Poland, plus what they lost to Lithuania and Czechoslovakia and Denmark at the end of WWI (not to mention all Germany\u2019s colonies). These lands had been traditionally German going back close to a thousand years or more (especially if you think in terms of the Goths and Vandals as Germanic peoples). To make it worse, the Russians\u2014-Germany\u2019s arch nemesis\u2014-occupied all of eastern Germany and half of the capital, Berlin. The only way I know to answer your question is in how Germans of the period that I know (and knew, including family members) felt about the end of the war. All of the them were deeply grateful to see the war the end. They knew Germany had a long hard road ahead of them, but they were at least still alive. All of them had suffered, not from the Third Reich, but from Allied bombings and attacks on their towns and cities. In fact, most said that life was fairly tolerable up until the last few months of the war. Food was available, as was fresh water. Electricity was usually restored within a few hours or days following an attack. Plumping and basic necessaries were still available, including medical treatment. However, beginning by February or March, things became progressively worse. More and more time was spent in air raid shelters and then, hours of putting out fires followed by cleaning up debris. Nevertheless, all said there spirit wasn\u2019t broken. But by April, especially late April, they were exhausted. Food, fresh water, and other necessaries were hard to come by. Medicine was non-existent. Electricity, working plumbing didn\u2019t exist. Many had no homes left and no secure places to stay at night. If it had been winter instead of the summer, tens of thousands may have died from exposure to the elements. Most of bridges were either destroyed or damaged and dangerous to cross. Many of the roads in and around cities and towns were cratered with bomb holes, while further out in the country they were littered with burnt out trucks and vehicles, destroyed military equipment, and the dead, be it human or animal. Almost everyone mentioned the sight of decaying bodies and the stench. Some of them talked about feeling ashamed to be German. When asked , it didn\u2019t seem to much about the war itself. Most thought the war was either justified or forced onto Germany. Of these, a few privately admitted to being Nazi members, but most weren\u2019t (as a disclaimer, none of my family were ever members that we know of). Most felt ashamed at having been defeated. Perhaps shocked or stunned may be a better word to use; maybe even disbelief. They were so sure they would somehow prevail. As to the loss of territory in the east, pretty much to a person resented the occupation by the Allies, but especially by the Russian. It seemed that everyone knew the British, Americans, and even French would be there for awhile, but ultimately, it would be temporary. However, they all knew the Russian would never leave. At the same time, they knew that the Poles, Czechs, Hungarians, Romanians and Bulgarians were in a worse position. In these place there were no Americans or British to defend them. They had to contend with the Russians all by themselves. They were trapped. I supposed they understood that these lands which were once German (even the heart and soul of Prussia, which had long dominated Germany), was gone forever. Russia would make sure of it. Perhaps it was the costs of war, or at least for losing the war. I don\u2019t think anyone of the people I\u2019ve spoken to ever thought these lands would be returned to Germany. A few thought that perhaps they deserved to lose these lands. Later, after learning about the Holocaust, some felt that perhaps a unified Germany was simply to dangerous. Maybe Germany should never be allowed to reunite with the East; perhaps Germany itself should be dissolved back into the independent nations or merged into other countries. The greatest sense of change was that Germany lost pretty much all of its former since of nationalism; of the pride to be German. They now saw themselves as Europeans first and foremost; German was a distant second, if even that. Despite the so-called \u201cGerman Miracle \u201d as Germany\u2019s recovery was known, along with its rise as Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse, it\u2019s only been fairly recently that Germans have begun to express any real pride in being German, and even that is still measured. So, while Germany has come to terms with the permanent loss of its former territories in the east, I think Germans in general (especially the children and grandchildren of the survivors) have yet to fully come to terms with the war itself; less so even than the Japanese and Italians. They still haven\u2019t managed to fully exorcise Hitler\u2019s ghost and embraced the notion that being German means so much more. ",

            "answer_text": "A very good question, and very relevant to what happens today. Can also explain a few things that happened in the US in the past. When the wall came down, the Poles were rather nervous because Germany did have valid claims to certain territories, definitely so East Prussia. This was the official stand by the German Government, as I remember, not exact words: \"Let keep the borders as they are as this will eliminate future disputes. Besides, in today's world, it makes no difference where the borders are.\" As a European born, this question is far broader than just Germany's eastern territories. Not in the question, but relevant: Alsace. It was an area of dispute, and effectively it should be part of Germany but is part of France. For most today, it makes no difference. Decades before the borders opened up in Europe, I crossed the Rhine several times without showing my passport; to give an example how things work out when governments [from afar] do not interfere with local matters. The 1800 were a time of nation building, a change from nobility/royalty and/or confederations and/or regions with much self-autonomy States with central governments; wasn't new but climaxed. German as a state was a fear for the existing powers (Bismarck's work). Late 1900 the opposite begun. When the Iron curtain came down, the USSR broke apart. Artificial countries split up, some peaceful (Czechoslovakia) some not (Yugoslavia). Territories under control of other countries became sovereign ones, starting with the colonies. The controlling central governments either tried to prevent it (Vietnam), or still do (Spain), or interfered/manipulated (Balkan war, Yugoslavia). The internet and geopolitical/economic interdependence have been ending the self-serving control of central governments (ought to add, its puppet masters), also the reason for the cooperation that rarely existed. For the first time, there is an understanding that we are all in the same boat, and even the strongest and biggest \"passengers\" know that rocking the boat ends up losing; some of course don't get it [yet]. As a naturalized citizen, this is very relevant to the US too: 1) It explains the strong federalist movement in the US and motives for the civil war (Washington): A break up in a time when central governments were formed? Central governments, just like the nobility/royalty, depend income, and allowing break ups that results in a fiscal loss and/or political/military power? On top of the expansionist ideas/movements that existed which depend on more centralized powers? 2) The civil unrests that are now broiling like milk heating up; all okay for now but who knows. The last election showed the mood of the people against the deep state, and the \"want to keep the power\" that split the \"[blinded] fanatics\" into polarizing the government and many citizens, and all the increased measurements of the government to keep control (moving towards a police state as many call it). 3) The Federal government [better puppet masters] tries maintain its world dominance with increased military \"intimidation\" to replaces the economic power that have been lost. Borders and owning/controlling territories today no longer have the importance they once had, be it within a country, over territories, or over other countries. Germany understood that laying claim on a territory will only create new problems whereas letting it gives benefits. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m an Army brat. My dad was stationed in West Germany in the 1970\u2019s, my high school years. For our first posting we lived in a tiny village next to the town that housed the base. We\u2019d go for walks in the evenings - it was what everyone did there - and attempt to use our very bad German. The Germans would attempt to understand us or use what English they had picked up. Many conversations were half guesses, confirmed with hand signals. One evening a young boy called out to another to ask the \u201cAmme\u201d to throw back a ball that had bounced towards us. An older man sharply corrected the boy, telling him to be polite. That was when I learned \u201cAmme\u201d (sounds like Amie) was both a word for \u201cwet nurse,\u201d and derogatory slang for \u201cAmerican.\u201d The man told us that the young would not understand that without NATO, all of Germany would have been Russian after the war or soon after. He said he was there when the world changed for Europeans during and after WWII, and again, when the USSR crushed freedoms in Czechoslovakia after Prague Spring. He described the period right after WWII as horrible - everyone abused everyone and many starved - but later on, when American families began to accompany soldiers to postings on American NATO military bases, American families, especially the children, had helped everyday people see how friendly and open life could be after fascism. He had nothing but gratitude for how humanity had turned out in the long run. America\u2019s entire history as a nation is less than 250 years old. The oldest continuously occupied English settlements go back another 150 years at best, and Americans are used to thinking of this as an entire history. Europeans can trace the history of where they live back to the Romans, acknowledging that there have been many, many changes over time. There are close neighbors on all sides who speak entirely different languages and can do the same thing. It\u2019s a different reality. ",

            "answer_text": "Do modern Germans regret having lost their eastern territories at the end of World War II? Well, do we? I think different people will give you different answers. I can tell you what I think and feel. Do I regret the loss? No. I was not around back then. I had K\u00f6nigsberger Klopse for lunch a few times, a Prussian dish, and loved them, but would I ever have wondered what that K\u00f6nigsberg even is? For sure not. At least during my time in school, I was not specifically taught that K\u00f6nigsberg, Breslau, Stettin and others were once German cities. Did learning about that fact change anything for me? Well, maybe a little. It made me more interested in seeing them. My family mostly stems from East Prussia, which of course would make the region of genealogical interest to me, but that is all. Breslau still stands, albeit maybe not as beautifully as it was before the war, Stettin also still stands - K\u00f6nigsberg has been ravaged. K\u00f6nigsberg is a different story to Wroc\u0142aw and Szczecin, though. Why? Because that is the only city I feel has been very unfairly treated. A once beautiful city, destroyed by German greed and later the Soviet\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s erase the past\u201d attitude. Wroc\u0142aw and Szczecin did not suffer that fate. But what would Germany gain from having it back? We did receive that offer, and Germany declined, because it would be a financial burden and the place is Russian now anyway. Very little of the German heritage remains. Germany would not rebuild Kaliningrad to K\u00f6nigsberg\u2019s glory. It\u2019s not going to happen. To sum this up: Let the past be past. Our grandparents who lived there or learned that Breslau was the third-biggest, K\u00f6nigsberg the 16th-biggest city in German, and those who were driven out will have certainly felt the loss of it. We don\u2019t. We don\u2019t know Germany any other way, and those of us that are of sound mind would never risk another war to make ridiculous gains or losses like these. ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t play a big role in our temporary thinking anymore. It will have been different 30 or 60 years ago and in other generations, but seeing how difficult it was and is to integrate our \u201cnew\u201d East makes wishing for more not very sensible. In fact, James Hawes highlighted the fact that the area he calls \u201cEast Elbia\u201d, i.e. much of what originally constituted \u201cPrussia\u201d and what is now divided by the Oder River has always been an underdeveloped area that was in need of constant funding by taxes raised mostly in West Germany:  I photographed this graphic from his book \u201cThe shortest history of Germany\u201d. I have never looked at the Eastern territories in this way, it wasn\u2019t a very popular viewpoint probably with all the public mourning by the organizations of deportees in former West Germany, but it contains an interesting point: These areas were never self-sufficient. I know that there was a sort of obligatory rotation for doctors and civil servants to the Eastern cities such as Breslau and K\u00f6nigsberg as they were struggling to hire enough staff by their own. But I didn\u2019t know that there was a constant cash flow from Western Germany towards the East even in Kaiserreich times (and ironically, even today, and not only towards what is now East Germany but also towards the areas that are now Polish as Poland is the biggest net recipient and Germany the biggest net contributor to EU funding). So, all in all, despite the losses, Germany is probably better off without these areas that would put an ever bigger strain on (West) German finances. I don\u2019t mean that I find it great that the country lost almost a third of its area or that I belittle the suffering of the people being forcefully deported. I recognize the pain that Germany brought over much of Europe which explains the rather harsh treatment of Germans in the former Eastern areas. I just wanted to provide another viewpoint towards these areas which has a lot of truth to it. To regain these areas would not just be impossible, wrong on so many levels, and a crime - but even if somehow feasible not seeming very wise. Germany doesn\u2019t need more underdeveloped and demographically challenged rural areas, we happen to have enough of our own, and not only in East Germany, also huge rural areas of West Germany are rapidly depopulating.

            "answer_text": "As a British person travelling in Germany, I\u2019ve seen the occasional graffiti and poster looking to reestablish German sovereignty over East Prussia or Silesia. But this does seem very much a fringe campaign, the subject has never come up in conversation with any German. The core historic German lands were essentially those within the boundaries of pre-unification West Germany. The eastern lands were first annexed by the Crusader Order of the Teutonic Knights, who had initially been invited into Poland in 1230 to help the newly Christian Polish Duke Konrad I of Masovia deal with the troublesome pagan Baltic Old Prussians on his Eastern border. The Teutonic Knights dealt with problem of the Old Prussians by eliminating them, then overstayed their welcome, carving out a territory around their fortress of Marienburg in East Prussia. Poland eventually managed to re-establish its sovereignty over these territories following the Polish-Lithuanian victory at Grunwald in 1410. The Mark of Brandenburg with its capital Berlin was once an Eastern border area with Poland, which was strong during the 15th-16th centuries; the term \u201cMark\u201d is similar to the Norman English term \u201cMarches\u201d for the border lands between England and Wales which Marcher Lords defended against Welsh incursion. Brandenburg grew in power, and was renamed Prussia, resurrecting the name of that vanished and non-Germanic people, when it became a kingdom in 1701. Between 1772 and 1795, Poland-Lithuania was progressively divided up between Prussia, Austria and Russia. Prussia then became the driving force behind the unification of Germany in 1870. German and Austrian defeat in World War I led to the re-birth of Poland, but Germany held on to Silesia and the enclave of East Prussia. After World War II, the victorious Russians raped and pillaged their way through Eastern Germany, pushed the boundary of Germany westwards, and then retained effective control over the Eastern European countries east of the \u201cIron Curtain\u201d, including East Germany until 1989. Russia removed all the German inhabitants from those lost eastern territories. It directly held part of East Prussia with its key Baltic port of K\u00f6nigsberg, renamed Kalinigrad, moving in ethnic Russians, rebuilding in typical drab Soviet style, but in recent times, creating a beautiful new Russian Orthodox cathedral there.  Kaliningrad Russian Orthodox Cathedral (Photo courtesy of Kaliningrad Oblast travel guide) Russia exacted brutal revenge against Germany for the Nazi invasion in World War II. But Kaliningrad today is a Russian city, Poland and Lithuania are a free democratic countries, and only a fantasist could envisage the return of its lost eastern territories to Germany. ",

Such questions show for me (and many Germans) a noticeable and often weird obsession of wars. People which families have lost properties in the WW II of course regret often, both of emotional and financial reasons- both seems quite human to me. In general, seeing territories from a national point of view is like hoping that zombies wake up- very 19th (and 20th) century thinking- or even middle age thinking. Wealth and quality of life is based on collaboration of people(s), national borders do not really matter much for large parts of modern life in 2018, at least from my point of view, living in peace with neighbour countries in the middle of Europe, good living conditions, few crime. Why anyone should want to change that? If someone wants to be more successful, more wealthy or whatever, whether it would be me or anyone else- he or she needs good international relationships- and not looking at conflict of last decades. See it the other way round- if you are successful, you want to be able to buy houses in other countries- for holiday, for travelling, for investing or whatever. It\u00b4s the internet- stupid, it\u00b4s international economy. Nothing should be of less interest for people than borders. ",

But to call them even a tiny minority would be an overstatement. The \u2018Bund der Vertriebenen\u2019 (\u2018Federation of Expellees\u2019) is the organization that traditionally represents people who have been expelled from the former eastern territories. It is anything but a left-wing organization and it\u2019s mostly comprised of expellees from the former eastern territories or their descendents. Not even they claim, that those territories should be handed back to Germany! In fact in their charter (written in 1950) it says: 1. We, the expellees, renounce all thought of revenge and retaliation. Our re-solution is solemn and sacred in memory of the infinite suffering brought upon mankind, particularly during the past decade. (you can read the whole thing here: Charta in Englisch ) So long answer short: There is no measurable amount of people living in Germany, who actually regret that East Prussia now is in Poland. ",

            "answer_text": "Well this is a loaded question (but I will keep it brief). The furthest eastern territories of imperial Germany were Polish & Lithuanian lands prior to Poland\u2019s dissolution in the 18th century. Poland never gave up its claim to self determination & briefly returned to independence in 1920 - only to again become vassal state of Russia until 1989. Of the last 223 years since Poland was dissolved in 1795, Poland has been independent at different times for 48 of the intervening years. The Prussian / Polish border had always depended upon the outcome of the previous war / skirmish between the two. It just so happened the Prussians had been ascendent over the Poles for a couple of centuries - hence they lay claim to the disputed territory until 1945. This set up eastern Europe for the horrific ethnic cleansing of BOTH world wars. The \u201cModern German\u201d is culturally / ethnically dissimilar to the pre war German. Stalin wanted the total destruction of Germany so that it would never pose a threat ever again. Russia lost 8million men in WW1 & many more WW2. Stalin wanted to execute 50,000 Germans from the Intelligentsia, local government, upper/middle classes, teachers etc. The purpose this was to cut off the head of German society & replace it anew with his own people. Stalin rounded up ALL ethnic Germans (about ?? 11million??) from eastern Europe & dumped them back in East Germany. During this time it would be fair to say there was a second Holocaust as their was a (deliberate) famine that claimed (some say not my numbers) around 1.5\u20132 million German civilians. Modern Germany is squeezed into 2/3 the size the land mass it once was with a significant ethnic minority \u2018German\u2019 population which has its roots as German speaking citizens of foreign lands. Germany is so utterly & permanently changed that I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll ever really address this question to themselves - let alone act upon it. The old Germanic Prussian attitudes & nature are long gone dead & buried - never to rise again. Germany had its heart, lungs & testicles ripped out if it in 1945. ",

It took 10 years including some lawyers to get my third of the inheritance (a few 1000 Euros). Because my grandfather was still missing and not yet 100 years old. So he would be a the heir of my grandmother. All important papers were no in poland. We needed papers from polish lawyers and authorities to declare him dead and get our money. But personally I am glad that Germany loses these territories and logically Hitler started the war. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019 exist.

Central : Poland\u2019s decline led to territorial loss and eradication. The Holy Roman Empire was destroyed by Napoleon and ceased to exist. Austria-Hungary broke up after WW1. Of course, The Third Reich falls into this category. Non-central: Sweden declined as a great power but kept their ethnic homeland intact. Spain lost their world power status but their nation state continued to exist. England also held together after her empire slipped away. Russian lands remain part of Russia after the USSR / Russia lost the republics. Germans must regret losing their eastern territories. But they lost a major war and they\u2019re located in central Europe. This means rule # 1 applies. ",

It wasn\u2019t until 1994 that the last Russians left East Germany (49 years) and it was a typical second world communist country that West Germany had to spend, I heard but don\u2019t know, over a Trillion dollars to upgrade thier roads, electricity, telephone system and just about every public utility you can think of and god knows how many buildings had to be demolished. The East Germans who owned eastern made cars had two years to not sell, but to throw away, thier cars. Thier land mass increased by 40% after unification. I spoke to only one German about the lost land and he said it does not effect them because it was land that was lost before most of them were born. I doubt they will ever get it back. ",

It's European Union, I could take a flight to Wroclaw and be at her home in just a few hours - but there is no good reason for me to do that. I've read that there is a nice Gothic festival at the Bolkeburg in Javor, but I feel too old for that stuff. I like to hear stories from that area when I meet Poles from there, that is all. Visiting the village by Street view feels... very strange, but it is definitely not regret. I was given a life and a home elsewhere. ",

A Germany that had not been Nazi would not only have had a much less troubled 20th century history, but it would have been able to keep Silesia in the bargain. ",

In a similar way, the Dutch and the British regret the disappearance of their global empires -- but generally recognize and accept that nothing lasts for ever (and reputation, good or bad, seems to have nothing much to do with how long it lasts.) German-speaking Prussians captured East Prussia in a religious \"crusade\" in mediaeval times and lived there for centuries: but their ancestors' home was elsewhere, in the Rhineland forests in Roman times and (perhaps) somewhere like Hungary or Romania centuries before that, but German history begins only with Tacitus's book Germania (100 AD.)

There was no Germany at all before 1815 or so. The borders of \"Germany\" shifted tremendously between 1815 and 1937, with Austria being a part of Germany, then not being a part of German and Prussia a steadily gobbling up and colonizing what is now Polish territory from 1700 on as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth collapsed. The entire idea of German ethnicity, identity & nationalism seems to be a relatively recent (1800s) invention. In any event, Germany has gained more influence through peace, prosperity, humanism and liberal democracy than it ever gained through war or empire. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is really simple. Stalin needed buffer states between Germany and the Soviet Union. As he said, every army that has invaded Russia for 500 years has passed through Poland and modern Germany (e.g., Napoleon). Just as Russians were resettled in Ukraine, Poles were resettled in eastern Germany (Prussia). It should be mentioned that Germany and Russia shared a land border in 1914. That land border disappeared in the treaty of Brest-Litovsk and the Treaty of Versailles. Poland was the corridor where the opposing armies met in August 1914. It was also the northern end of Hitler\u2019s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. The German officer class, until 1945, was primarily Prussian aristocracy. Accordingly for the safety of the Soviet union, two things were necessary. 1. Advance its European border westward and protect it with buffer states. 2. Erase any trace of Prussian militarism, and if that meant erasing Prussia, so be it. Putin is a pain in the behind nowadays because he misses the buffer states. ",
