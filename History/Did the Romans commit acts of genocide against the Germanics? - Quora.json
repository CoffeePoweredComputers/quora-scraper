            "answer_text": "Well, there were some acts that can be considered genocides: the Teutones were basically exterminated by Marius, and the Cimbri that weren\u2019t, were enslaved. But the same happened with several Celtic tribes as well under C. Julius Caesar: (from Wikipedia, Gaul - Wikipedia): \u201cAs many as a million people (probably 1 in 5 of the Gauls) died, another million were enslaved, 300 clans were subjugated and 800 cities were destroyed during the Gallic Wars. The entire population of the city of Avaricum (Bourges) (40,000 in all) were slaughtered. Before Julius Caesar's campaign against the Helvetii (present-day Switzerland), the Helvetians had numbered 263,000, but afterwards only 100,000 remained, most of whom Caesar took as slaves.\u201c Mileage did vary\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Others have listed possible instances. But I\u2019m going to say \u201cNot really\u201d, because what the Romans did was just the way wars were fought back then, at least against \u201cbarbarians\u201d: you kept killing the enemy until they no longer posed a threat. For tribes that were stubborn enough, that could lead very close to extinction, and if the survivors were taken away as slaves, it meant the end of your tribe. ",

These were the rules. There was not the intention to commit a genocide. Getting money or slaves was more important. ",
