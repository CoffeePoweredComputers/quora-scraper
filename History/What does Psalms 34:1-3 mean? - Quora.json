            "answer_text": "David had been driven into an awkward and somewhat compromising situation. He found himself groveling before an enemy of Israel. He pretended to have lost his mind and Abimelech threw him out of the camp. Here in Psalm 34, David is praising and giving glory and gratitude to God for saving him from out of what could have been his demise. God has placed these dramatic stories in His Word in order to encourage us in our lives today to remember that He is willing to help us also, even when we get our selves into ridiculous situations that we had no right being in in the first place. And when we do, and we will, let us not forget to do what David did in giving thanks and praise to our loving heavenly Father. ",

[3] Oh, magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together! David\u2019s joy in Psalm 34 to God is uncontainable. He had just been miraculously rescued from the grips of Abimilech and couldn\u2019t help but express his gratitude toward God! Spurgeon describes David\u2019s affections: \u201dHe is resolved and fixed\u2026 he is personally and for himself determined, let others so as they may; he is intelligent in head and inflamed in heart\u2014he knows to whom the praise is due, and what is due, and for what and when. To Jehovah, and not to second causes our gratitude is to be rendered.\u201d ",
