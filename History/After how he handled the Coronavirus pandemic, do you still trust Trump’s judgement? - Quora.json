He shut travel from Europe, he was mocked for overreacting\u2026 Now the same Democrats who mocked and criticized his every action to minimize the effects of this alleged pandemic are claiming he didn't do enough soon enough. When Trump announced certain existing medications have been having a positive outcome in treating the Wuhan virus he was mocked as providing false hope, when Democrats like Cuomo touted the same exact medications he was praised. Trump can do no good in the Democrats or media's eyes. I wouldn't want anyone else running the country in these trying times. Democrats have criticized Trump as dictator like, yet he hasn't done anything dictator like. Democrats are now upset that he isn't acting more like a dictator. There is no pleasing you people. You have all wished something like this on us to crash the economy to make Trump look bad. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, in fact Trump has impressed me greatly in the last few months. Trump\u2019s handling of the corona virus crisis has encouraged me to believe that he has the ability to take on anything the Presidency of the United States could hand him, including an actual shooting war. He has made the hard calls, such as shutting down flights from China, quickly and with no apparent dithering. He has listened to experts and changed his mind, as when he wanted the country to reopen for Easter and then decided that the end of April was safer. And he has appointed good people to do difficult jobs, and then supported them \u2014 Drs. Fauci and Dirx and Rear Admiral John Polowczyk are examples. There are hundreds of other examples of excellent leadership that the country has witnessed over the last few months. Trump has built up a lot of credibility among even Democratic governors for his willingness to work to keep the American people safe, no matter what their political leanings. Despite the cavils of the liberal media, President Trump has done an excellent job of handling the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and I, among others, have noticed. ",

Failure to balance all those interests would cost far more lives in the long term and threaten the fundamental well being of our nation and way of life going forward. As a mere human being, he has done an exceptional job of putting together a team of experts and maintaining that careful balance while keeping the American people well informed and reassured going forward.
