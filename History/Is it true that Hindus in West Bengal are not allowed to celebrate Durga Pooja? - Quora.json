            "answer_text": "This is not only false but it would sound as a joke to any people of Bengal. There is a proverb in Bengali \u201c 12 mash e 13 parbon\u201d which means basically we have 12 months in a calendar but we would celebrate more festivals than the total number of months in a year. Now coming to your question Durga puja is the most awaited and most celebrated festival for all Bengalis residing all over the world . While Kolkata and its adjoining areas and suburbs celebrate it to the fullest. Its the largest festival of bengalas well as Bengalis. I guess this question was raised last year. Its a very rare incident but rumors were there that in some places of Bengal due to some communal problems people were not allowed to celebrate durga puja. It was an incident at Naihati (some where in North 24 parganas District) people were not allowed to set up pandel, Apart from that one incident was reported from a village of Birbhum as well. Now the authenticity of these news is a bit questionable as this like other cases doesn\u2019t have any circumstantial evidence i.e Media coverage. So we should not blindly trust this.Its not the religion which creates these confusions but always some political colors would play from behind. Apart from this the questioned fact is completely false. In fact in many areas of bengal all Religions would celebrate durga puja unitedly. We are proud to celebrate Durga puja and would eagerly wait for the 4 days throughout the year. :) Hope this answer would help you. ",

All Citizens of West Bengal, India or some foreign state, present in West Bengal,Irrespective of their religions, caste or originsIn case you areMuslimHinduChristianFollow a Tribal ReligionJewAtheistOr of any other religious group/belief groupare free to Celebrate Durga Puja. In fact it would not be shocking to find that Durga Puja has become much like Diwali.People of all religions tend to celebrate as while it has religious origins maybe, the modern meaning is that of :- Coming together and CelebratingCommunicating with peopleWishing people lifelong happinessBut more important than the rest,Enjoying in Peace and Harmony in each other\u2019s company What OP should READ?Maybe the OP would like to read Tripura Muslims celebrate Durga Puja  It\u2019s for Tripura but applies in West Bengal as well. But isn\u2019t as shocking in case For West Bengal, the OP should read Promoting communal harmony, Muslims in this West Bengal village organize Durga Puja for their Hindu brothers - Times of India  Why it Happened?As Shreya Samadder mentions, in all probability it is a one-off incident.It was probably IMHO set off by some weirdos or some blokes looking for fame or to make a political point ",
