            "answer_text": "The Post War History (since 1945) history of Japan is interesting as well inspiring. After WW II had ended with nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan was devastated. All the large towns, the industries and the transportation networks were in ruins. A severe shortage of food continued for several years. Japan lost the Kurile islands that were occupied by the Soviet Union, and the entire Japanese civilian population of roughly 17,000 was expelled from there by 1946. The territorial dispute with Russia concerning the Kurile Islands has not been resolved yet. The Ryukyu Islands, including Okinawa, were controlled by the US. Okinawa was returned to Japan in 1972. The remains of Japan's war machine were destroyed, and war crime trials were held. Over 500 military officers committed suicide right after Japan surrendered, and many hundreds more were executed for committing war crimes. A new constitution went into effect in 1947. Japan was also forbidden to ever lead a war again or to maintain an army. However, in 1952, the occupation ended. Japan's military was established in 1954. After the Korean War in 1950 and accelerated by it, Japan's economy recovered and flourished. The economic growth resulted in a quick rise of the living standards, changes in society and the stabilization of the political system. The US was also keen to develop the economy of Japan because there was a risk after World War II that an unhappy and poor Japanese population would turn to communism. Japanese economic miracle refers to the significant increase in the Japanese economy during the time between the end of World War II and the end of the Cold War (1945\u20131991). Now Japan is the world's third largest automobile manufacturing country. has the largest electronics industry and is often ranked among the world's most innovative countries. It is the 3rd largest country in the world by nominal GDP, after the US and China. Industry accounts for 24% of the nation's GDP. Looking at the size of Japan and its population it is a remarkable achievement. ",

            "answer_text": "For me, there are only a few, but meaningful. Here are they. Meiji Period (1967\u20131912), this period is the second most influential era of modern Japan due to several changes like Meiji Restoration which made Japan like now.Showa Period (1926\u20131989), this period is the most influential era of Modern Japan due to emergence of multinational companies, from Toyota to Panasonic. Because of this, Japanese brands are known by people around the world.For me, Showa Period is the most influential one because many things are emerging from this time. This because of establishment of multinational companies and growing Japanese economy. Brands from Japan are known around the world from decades until brand from other countries invaded in early 21st century. Japanese economy was one of the largest in the world until being beaten by China in 2011. ",
