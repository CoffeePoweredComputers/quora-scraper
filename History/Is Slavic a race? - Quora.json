            "answer_text": "No. Racial theories cannot be applied to the Slavs. It is more like a ever-changing polycentric constellation of ethnicities that have some common linguistical and cultural core features (one can find several similarities between every two Slavic peoples, no matter how geographically distant, but there is no a set common to all). The word \u201crace\u201d in Serbs\u2019 language (it\u2019s \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0430 / rasa) is almost always used in a positive connotation, like: \u201c\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d \u043a\u043e\u045a / rasan konj\u201d - a horse with a good family line,\u201c\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d \u043f\u0430\u0441 / rasan pas\u201d - a dog of certain breed,\u201c\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0447 / rasan traga\u010d\u201d - natural born tracker,\u201c\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d \u043f\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0447 / rasan peva\u010d\u201d - a talented singer from a line of talented singers,\u201c\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d \u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a, rasan \u010dovek\u201d - a man looking athletic, superior, as some of his ancestors known to the speaker, etc.Only one example of a negative use I found so far, that is, \u201c\u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0436\u0459\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0430\u201d \u2018(in a less-known poem written by one of our well-known poets). I guess the term is similarly used in some other Slavic languages. It would be a surprise if we all have the same attitude to it. Obviously - it\u2019s not our thing. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "No, It's just a language group in Central, Eastern and South-eastern Europe. People who use slavic langunages are extremely various in all possible ways - genetic background, culture in broad meaning of the term, level of development, etc. Movement called panslavism try to claim false idea that these people are more/less homogenous. It's naturally nonsense. This idea was used by Soviet propaganda and It's still used by Russian propaganda\u2026 ",
