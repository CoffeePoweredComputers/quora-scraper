            "answer_text": "Victoria\u2019s reign lasted from 1837 - 1901, so the earlier part of the 19th century was Georgian, and manners then were often abrupt. Both high and low Georgians tended to see the world in a binary way, either acceptable or not; they were used to looking after themselves in the general absence of authority figures such as police, who were not numerous even after the major changes of the 1830s. One could say that at the start of the century many people were used to the old, pre-industrial life based not on cities but on agriculture and instinctive deference to the upper and middle classes, which tended to persist for quite a while. I think the main point about the 19th century is the sheer pace and amount of change which people lived through. At the start life was in flux as thousands moved from country to town, from agriculture to factories, and from small villages to rookeries. This happened whilst there was no real social safety-net except parish relief, little medical care for the poorest and not much that was effective even for the wealthy, and many aspects of daily life being worked out on the hoof. Wages were as low as the employer could get away with, bread and milk adulterated, much housing ancient and dilapidated, water and gas supplies being installed ad hoc by numerous independent companies, and everyone trying to make a penny by any possible means. It must have been sheer bedlam for the poor, and even the better-off must have gone in constant fear until society began to stabilise. Against that background, politeness would have been an essential social lubricant - literally a case of \u201ca soft answer turns away wrath\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "To add to Jim Wayne\u2019s great answer, I would like to point the difference between politeness and etiquette. Politeness in my view stems from respect for other people, mostly treating people like you would like them to treat you. Etiquette is made of rules that showed the position in society of different people. There is a story that illustrates this well. A king of France, Louis XIV I think, visited an bed-ridden minister, As he got near the bedroom of the man his entourage became aware of a huge problem: it just wouldn\u2019t do for the king to be standing up in the presence of someone who was below him. They thought of carrying on a chair but even that was not enough so they carried him in the room on another bed! Those rules had nothing to do with mutual respect but all to do with showing that the king was above others. Never mind the fact that we have picture from both World War where the British kings were visiting injured soldiers, standing in public among bed-ridden commoners without jeopardizing their majesty. The dining scene in the film Pretty Woman is another exemple of that. Is there really a need for all these kind of flatware, probably not. But they are useful to show who comes from the right part of society versus the rabble. So some of manners of Victorian time were a matter of mutual respect and some was a marker of social class. ",
