            "answer_text": "Not everyone looks at Genghis Khan negatively. He is, for example, a revered figure in Mongolia, with the status of \u201cFather of the Nation\u201d, not dissimilar to George Washington\u2019s reputation in the US. Even among western based historians, there are positive viewpoints on Genghis Khan\u2019s legacy. For example: Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World - Wikipedia It is said that history is written by the winners. But this is not precisely true. It is more accurate to say that history is written by the ones who endure. And in this case, though Khan\u2019s empire was certainly victorious in its day, it did not last long, and the ones who did endure, the Chinese, the Islamic civilizations of the Middle East, and the civilizations of Europe, etc, were all Genghis Khan\u2019s enemies who suffered at his hand or the hands of his successors. They wrote most of the histories and naturally most of those histories don\u2019t paint Khan and his Mongols very positively! And Genghis himself was partially responsible for his reputation. He and his successors had historians and scribes in their employ, but instead of commanding them to minimize accounts of Mongol brutality, they actually instructed them to exaggerate those tales. The Mongols wanted to use a reputation for savagery and brutality as a psychological weapon to aid in their conquests. They made it very clear that any city that surrendered to them without resistance and remained loyal afterwards would be treated well, sometimes with even the old rulers kept in place, now as administrators answerable to Mongol central authority. Looting would be prohibited. Rape by Mongol forces would not be allowed. Rule of law would be maintained. And for the most part the Mongols kept those promises. However, if your city did resist or rebel, they wanted it to be known that the consequence would be that you would be annihilated down to the last chicken. And they kept their word on this as well. And the strategy did work. Much of their conquests were achieved diplomatically without bloodshed because many of their opponents DID choose to surrender and join the Mongol Empire without a fight. Objectively speaking, though, the scale of their atrocities is not really that much different from what earlier (and later) conquering Empires like the Assyrians, Romans, the various European colonial powers, and of course the Axis in WWII, etc did, relative to the size of their Empire and the length of time that it endured. They just got more negative press for it for the reasons listed above. ",

            "answer_text": "???Are you kidding me??? What makes you think the world\u2019s attitude towards Genghis Khan today negative at all? Not in the least! You should be asking: Why is Genghis Khan looked at so positively? Today, we have restaurants around the world named after Genghis Khan, and they are doing well.  In contrast, look at the restaurants today that tried to name themselves after Adolf Hitler. They do not last - their owners receive death threats, and they are forced to shut down in less than a few years. Yet, there is no one I know of who is more vile, cruel, wicked, ruthless, merciless, inhuman, savage, barbaric, sadistic and murderous than Genghis Khan, who killed his enemies and civilians in unprecedented numbers and in the most horrific ways. His delightful character can be seen from his childhood. At age 13 he killed his brother over an argument about sharing food (a fish). In the 13th century, Genghis Khan\u2019s army razed entire cities to the ground, and was known for its brutality e.g. pouring molten silver into his enemies\u2019 eyes to kill them and cutting up civilians\u2019 gut, stomach and intestines with swords to uncover hidden gems. Not to mention catapulting dead bodies infested with the plague into cities to spread disease, using enemy soldiers as shields in battle, making pyramids of enemy heads, and building monuments with enemy skulls.  Yes, Genghis Khan\u2019s empire covered more of the Earth\u2019s surface than any other empire in history, stretching from Korea to East Europe. This sounds like a compliment, but imagine the amount of killing he did to achieve this. He literally traveled across the globe to kill. Genghis\u2019 conquests killed 40 million people around the world. That is 10% of the world population at the time (compare this with 2\u20133% of the world\u2019s population which died in World War 2). Just imagine, to \u201cachieve\u201d this with ONLY primitive sharp metal blades and fire, without the power of bombs and rapid fire machine guns. That takes an insane amount of drive and commitment, even more than today\u2019s investment bankers who boast about putting in 100\u2013150 hour work weeks. Genghis Khan committed genocides and massacres, one after another. In China alone he killed over 10 million people and destroyed 92 cities, and is estimated to have killed 50% to 80% of the population of China at the time. (10 million people might sound like peanuts to you now, because the world population is 7 billion now. But remember, Genghis Khan lived about 700 years ago. The world population was only about 400 million back then! Adjusting for \u201cinflation\u201d, that means Genghis would have killed 700 MILLION PEOPLE TODAY! Take a short moment to imagine the impact of killing 700 million people today. ) A few further examples: Genghis brutally massacred the Persian empire (present day Iran), killing as much as 75% of their population. His army (under his descendant) destroyed Baghdad, killing almost everyone there, between 200,000 to 1 million within a week. The Mongolian army didn\u2019t just kill people, but also destroyed the Grand Library which was the center of learning in the Islam empire for many centuries, and said to be the world\u2019s largest collection of books in the 9th century. The river Tigris supposedly ran black from the ink of the books and ran red with the blood of the scholars. His army destroyed the entire agriculture system of canals which were thousands of years old (since Mesopotamia days). The caliph was executed by rolling his body in carpet and kicking by horses. With Genghis\u2019 fearsome reputation, some cities would surrender to him without a fight, but he would sometimes send advance emissaries to \u201ctest\u201d the sincerity of their surrender by randomly killing a few civilians in the city and seeing if they would retaliate. If a city he was besieging gave up without a fight, its people would usually be spared but would have to go under Mongol control. If the city fought against the Mongols, everyone, including civilians and children, would be massacred. Even dogs and cats are not spared. His cruelties are not limited to Asians and Muslims. He also conquered much territory in Russia, including numerous Russian cities, like Kiev and Moscow, and killed over 500,000 Russians. He killed Russian nobles by laying them under a wooden platform and holding a victory banquet over them, laying tables and chairs and feasting and dancing above them. Genghis is also the protagonist in the most massive scheme in history of raping or keeping women as sex slaves. Today, geneticists estimate 8% of people living in regions that used to be ruled under Mongolians are descended from Genghis Khan\u2019s family, or about 16 million people. (Yes, Donald Trump, he\u2019s got more hot women than you!) Genghis Khan\u2019s reflection on the pleasures of life: \u201cThe greatest joy a man can know is to conquer his enemies and drive them before him. To ride their horses and take away their possessions. To see the faces of those who were dear to them bedewed with tears, and to clasp their wives and daughters in his arms.\u201d From this quote, it is clear that he did not wage wars for the benefit of his country, but as a psychotic personal fetish for enjoying the inflicting and watching of the pain and suffering of others. Hitler and Stalin look like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck next to Genghis Khan, and ISIS look like a bunch of Teletubbies. (apologies in advance, fans of Disney and Teletubbies) ",
