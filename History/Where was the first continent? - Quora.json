Rodinia is Russian meaning \u2018to beget\u2019 or \u2018Give birth\u2019 to symbolize that this was the first actual continent we know about. The Ocean surrounding it was named \u2018Mirovia' which translates to \u2018Global (Ocean)\u2019 in Russian.  It should be noted that all reconstructions of Rodinia are estimations. We have difficulty back-tracking everything plate tectonics has done, especially so long ago. ",
