            "answer_text": "The right to vote isn\u2019t something that has always been with us, and nowadays it is some kind of privilege we still despise. As someone who hasn\u2019t been ever able to vote, but has seen people in her country do so for money, favors, social and family pressure or not even voting, it hurts that we still need to be reminded how important a single vote can be. Last year in Colombia the president, Juan Manuel Santos, called for a plebiciste where the Peace Agreement between the goverment and FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia) was going to be either approved or denied by the citizens; not to mention FARC were the oldest guerrilla group involved in more than five decades of war in the country. Like I said before, people voted against it due to money, favors and pressure. In addition, a large group of the population didn\u2019t vote, but it doesn\u2019t stop there. The main political party against the plebiscite used misinformation and malvertisement to get to convince people to vote \u2018no\u2019. After the \u2018no\u2019 won, young colombians who felt their future was on the line had to do something. Several marches took place all over the country to show disagreement with the results. A huge quantity of the marchers were people under 18 years old who couldn\u2019t do anything, but to stand for what they believed was the right thing to do and the right moment to do so. The president had to use all the resources in the Congress and the Agreement was signed even after the popular vote rejected it. The message of this story is that even we (under 18 y/o) as Colombian citizens which belong into a social state under the rule of law, who also happens to be a democracy, were so frustrated not only by the results of the election, but because we weren\u2019t allowed to use that privilege yet, that promoted a movement because we were not going to watch our country let an opportunity to end a war of 52 years old literally go to the sink. If you ever wonder why you should take the time to leave your house and do a check mark, an \u2018x\u2019, answer yes or no on paper, remember people fought for you to have the right to vote. And, if you are the ones who think their candidate is going to lose, well, democracy is race and candidates are racing against each other, meaning losing is part of it too. ",
