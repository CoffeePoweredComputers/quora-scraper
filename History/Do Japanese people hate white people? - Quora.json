            "answer_text": "Years ago, my Japanese friend was travelling to the Middle East. He went through a bunch of countries I would be scared to even pass over in a plane. He told me that in the Middle East, it is often great to be Asian because very few people view you as a threat or an enemy. Most of the people there were delighted to meet him and talk with him. He talked about the beauty of Iran, the compassion of Saudi Arabia, the openness of Egypt. \u2026I am still not going there though. Here is a typical day for me in Japan: 6:10: Wake up, eat breakfast 6:30: Walk to train station 6:50: Get on super crowded train where people fight for standing space 7:45: Walk to work. My coworkers greet me. The guy at the convenience store where I buy coffee makes small talk with me. 7:50: I get to work where my coworkers, my supervisors and my coworkers greet me. 8:30: I go to our building wide morning meeting where I am the only non-Asia person. Some people make jokes standing on tiptoes to be as tall as me. I am 6\u20323 so I tend to hit my head a lot on doorways in Japan. 8:45: I return to my desk and start working on my projects. No one asks me what I do. When I ask for advice, they provide it. When I delegate some projects to my other coworkers, no one asks me why. (I have a title similar to a Kakaricho, which is a lower managerial position) 12:00: I buy lunch at the convenience store. Come back, call my wife. 1:00: I go back to work. I decide my schedule, I visit other departments as necessary. I continue to decide what I want to spend my time on. 5:30: I leave work. Whether I leave earlier or later than other people, no one makes comments. There are days when I leave at 9 PM too but 5:30 is more common. If we stay for an hour of overtime, we get paid for it. 5:45: I take the train home which is always crowded but no one even glances at me. 7:00: I eat dinner with my wife and 3 year old. We watch television. I sometimes bathe my little boy afterwards if he hasn\u2019t yet had a bath. During my average day, no one comments on my Japanese even when they can\u2019t understand it. (Which does happen even though I have an N1* because I work in the media and marketing department which has a lot of specialized terms) My coworkers invite me for drinks, they talk to me about what is happening behind the scenes. The girl in HR asks how my 3-year old is when I meet her in the elevator. There are Japanese ways of speaking which emphasize Japaneseness but most of it is just from a business perspective. I work in a mid-size Japanese company with branches on 3 continents. I travel through rush-hour in Tokyo and get off at Akihabara, which is one of the many downtowns in Tokyo. During my day, I have no interactions that make me feel like I am anything less. When I go for medical checkups, people are polite and actually more caring than the doctors I interacted with in Canada. When I go to get my VISA renewed every few years, the staff tell me to ignore little mistakes and they will fix it. When I return to Japan after going abroad, the Narita airport customs staff smile and sometimes even say welcome back. I have never felt singled out, belittled or insulted for being White. People ask me silly questions sometimes like whether I can use chopsticks (I speak pretty fluent Japanese and have lived here for almost 4 years, if I couldn\u2019t, they should call a doctor). They show interest in the differences and give me room to make mistakes when I don\u2019t respond in typical Japanese fashion. I doubt my experience is very unique. During any of these interactions, do you detect any racism or stereotyping? I don\u2019t think so. In Asia, there is racism. I just don\u2019t see it or experience it as a white person. ** the highest level in the JLPT Japanese language test, ",

I\u2019m a white Jew who grew up surrounded by Latinos and Asians in Australia. I\u2019ve gotten along just fine and made lots of precious friends. I\u2019ve gone to high school in Japan and speak Japanese daily. Almost every encounter I\u2019ve ever had with a Japanese person has been positive and some of my most important friends are Japanese people. A lot of people still see culture and race as being one and the same, but they aren\u2019t. I\u2019m living proof. Very few people hate other people because of their race alone, typically there are cultural and historical factors that fuel racism and discrimination. Like I said, the world is a lot kinder than you think, I don\u2019t know where you live but if it\u2019s any major city in America go out and find some interesting people who are also interested in you, share a beer with them. Ethnicity means nothing when you compare it to the social and cultural complexity that is identity. ",
