            "answer_text": "You have it backwards. You should really be asking, \u201cAround what year did the first theists appear?\u201d. In which the answer to that would be roughly between 100,000 to 50,000 years ago (give or take out of the entire on-going 4 billion year evolutionary history of life on Earth) when certain superstitious members of a species of African great ape that\u2019s been around for only 200,000 to 300,000 years called Homo sapiens invented theism/religion, and countless other superstitions out of their own ignorance to help them explain the unknown, albeit very poorly and incorrectly. Atheism on the other hand has always been here, and always will be here. Every past, present, and future human was, is, and will be born an atheist due to being born without an automatic and instinctive belief in gods and/or gods and all other associated supernatural beings, places, forces, phenomena, and concepts. And/or beliefs in anything and everything else for that matter. By definition and extension, this also means that every past, present, and future nonhuman organisms/species (or to be even more specific, non-Homo sapiens species, since there have been many species of humans that existed over most of the past 7 million years of human evolution on the hominin family tree) was, is, and will be atheists due to not having the \u201cgod\u201d concept as part of their mentality and behavior throughout their entire lives. Therefore, atheism is the default mental state. Theism/religion on the other hand, has to be brainwashed into people by other people before they are old enough to analytically, critically, honestly, rationally, and skeptically think for themselves. My 2 cents. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Around what year did the first atheist appear? A: Around 88,000 years ago. Her name was Ngyla. You have never heard of her. She lived in a tribe in the middle-east some 88,000 years ago. Her fellow tribesman Geng had discovered that if you walked clockwise (not that there were any clocks) around the big rock outside their cave, it once rained. Geng has since made more elaborated ways of walking around the rock, and now he has made the conclusion that the Rock God makes it rain if you appease it with dances and offerings of food through him. One day Geng said to Ngyla, \u201cGeng high priest of rock god. Ngyla must give berries and nookie to Geng, or rock god angry.\u201d Then Ngyla said \u201cGeng stuff rock god up own arse. Rock is rock. Geng is stupid. Ngyla not believe in rock god.\u201d And thus Ngyla was the first ever atheist.  Well, not exactly, but sometime after one of our cave-dwelling ancestors said \u201cthere are gods and we must appease them\u201d, another cave-dwelling ancestor said \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d We may never know whom or when, but as long as there has been religion, there have been people who said \u201cstuff it, you silly sod\u201d. And the only way to stop them seems to be to get in power so you can burn the \u201cstuff it, you silly sod\u201d-people at the stake for insulting whatever god the people in power profess to believe in. So it is also rather likely that Ngyla was the first victim of the first inquisition. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello Ars\u00e8ne, in the first instance I trust that you are enjoying your retirement, or at least your break from the beautiful game. Now you are asking me who was the first Arsenal fan who had stopped believing in you. As I am not personally acquainted with all the 27 million world wide fan-base, it is really difficult to say. But to begin with, let me attempt to ascertain when exactly you first became a deity. When you were appointed as Arsenal manager in the September 1996, you stated that the principal reason for accepting the position was that you loved English football. As for the club captain, Tony Adams\u2019 opinion of you, he was unimpressed. He mentioned something about your wearing glasses and looking like a school teacher. However, you went on to achieve great things. I would imagine that it was around the turn of the twenty first century that you became a god. You won the Premier League in 1998, 2002 and 2004. You won the FA Cup in 1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2014, 2015, and 2017. The honors that have been heaped on you over the years is quite frankly breathtaking. Officer of the Order of the British Empire (2003), Legion d\u2019Honneur (2004), and if I were to list all the football honors, I would be here all night. It is scarcely surprising that at least somewhere, someone had you dietized. I would point out that it was only in the past few years that people stopped believing in you. Although you appeared to finish in the top four forever, those results were not quite what were expected of a god. In other words they became atheists. As for the exact year, this is open to question. No doubt it was these fans straying into paganism that influenced your decision to hang up your boots. To conclude Ars\u00e8ne, you were a fantastic manager, and one who did great things for my favorite football club of all time. Unfortunately I have to end on a sad note. We are not doing so well at the moment. Would you like to come back?  This is a great picture of you. ",

            "answer_text": "To answer this question one should have a good knowledge of the History of Religion. By studying ancient texts one comes to know that to the ancients \u201cgod\u201d meant \u201clord\u201d. So, as long as the lords were earthly lords and not heavenly gods, no one had any reason to doubt the existence of the tyrannical lords, who were killing and raping their subjects. By 15k years ago, at the latest, the tyrannical lords lost the power to their slaves and had to leave the area (the ancient Near East). It was then that it was said, to those chasing the fleeing lords, that the lords had climbed ladders and went to live on the clouds. The dating of the deification of the lords is based on the fact that the American Indians, who had been living isolated for approximately 12k years, knew of the existence of the \u201cheavenly people\u201d. Therefore, the first atheists were the same ones who had created the gods, i.e. those who had said that the lords went to live in the sky. Since then, and up to this date, the royals and the archbishops and popes are all of them secretly atheists because they are the descendants of the original frauds. Dimitrios Trimijopulos's answer to Is the God idea a positive fraud? ",

Because god is a human invention to describe what we didn\u2019t understand. Babies and animals and plants have no concept of a god. They are all atheists. People become theists by influence of others. Always. Since the homo-sapiens is estimated to have first appeared around 300,000 years ago, the first human atheist appeared around this time. The tricky thing about evolution though, is that we cannot date precisely when a species first appears. It\u2019s not a black and white kind of thing, it\u2019s more like a gradient. So if the homo-sapiens first appeared 300K years ago, it means that he was virtually indistinguishable from the homo-heidelbergensis, which is its predecessor. I\u2019ll guarantee that the homo-heidelbergensis were also atheists. ",

So the human mind was free of god belief for hundreds of thousands of years\u2026 effectively all humans were atheists. Even now, all humans are obviously born atheist, and it is not until they have been convinced by their elders and teachers that they should believe in the god myth.
