            "answer_text": "It depends on who\u2019s doing the \u201cconsidering.\u201d Most Filipinos (and most outsiders aware of Philippine history) consider him a hero. As a young man he led a Revolution against Spain that succeeded (or almost succeeded, depending on your interpretation of events), was elected first President of the Philippine Republic, fought against the Americans for another couple of years until he was captured, and then lived another sixty-odd years. He did run for President of the Commonwealth once (and lost badly), and he cooperated with the Japanese during WWII more than many people thought he should have, but basically it was a dignified retirement, worthy of an elder statesmen. A minority of vehement nationalists, however, consider him a traitor for his involvement in the deaths of Andres Bonifacio, who started the Revolution, and Antonio Luna, a leading general in the Philippine-American War. They tend to push binary arguments in which you are either FOR Bonifacio or FOR Aguinaldo, and therefore must regard the other with contempt (or FOR Luna or Aguinaldo), rather than accepting the fact that in history, as in life, there are few absolute heroes or villains. This whole mindset gets stirred up again every time a film comes out depicting - usually in a cinematically unbalanced way - the events of that time, most recently Heneral Luna, as I recall. On balance, however, we must conclude Aguinaldo is still considered a hero, though perhaps a flawed one. ",

            "answer_text": "Many Filipinos view Emilio as a traitor because he ordered the court-martial and execution of Andres. But Andres has served his time; Andres was not able to maintain his position as Supremo of the Katipunan. If Pinas go by the line of Andres, his was but one of a series of revolts. Emilio established a working government for about four years, and an army that was able to fight. The lack of Emilio\u2019s government was absence of recognition by one or more states, or Powers. And adequate arms. Only Japan sold some rifles to Pinas. When the Army was overpowered and Emilio captured, some soldier-officers exiled themselves to Japan. Filipinos are emotional and go for the underdogs and for the movies, very anti-reality. Andres is mince-meat to the schooled ilustrados, will be able to manage only a small warehouse by the Pasig River and fit only to open the hostilities but cannot follow it up to a conclusion. The Filipino mind is immature till now. Or uninformed of facts or both. Andres is a hero of the Tagalogs but Emilio unfurled the Philippine flag that is flying now in the Rizal Part (Luneta). You think a lawyer like Apolinario will bow to a guy like Andres? You think Major Bugallon will ever take orders from Andres? Let Andres prepare his Ordinanzas? Be real, Andres is not equipped for a Revolution. Our fellow Pinoys are in their dreamlands. Kaya walang asenso, emotional and will never confront the hard facts. In present day comparison, Andres is a capataz, Emilio the engineer. Take your pick. When I presented this Argument in class in 1979, my sophomore classmates fell silent then most booed me. Reality is harsh. If your fellow soldiers execute you by a firing squad, something is wrong with you for arriving at that unwelcome stage of the revolution and power struggle. You lost, and to the losers, grief and tears. Some professors upvote Andres as a champion of the Masses(!). Masses ha! Pinas is unreal and many of its otherwise intelligent, schooled and educated and supposedly educated people create their own Realities. It was only in 1917 when Lenin delivered his \u201cAno Ang Nararapat na Gawin\u201d (What Is To Be Done). Masses and Proletariat are of recent vintage in Pinas\u2019 \u2019a cluster of islands where the still-born Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis line is less a hundred years (meaning only a few weeks ago in the History of states.) and fast fading. Emilio a traitor? Granted, but it does not Andres a hero. ",
