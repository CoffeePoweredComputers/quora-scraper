            "answer_text": "He was a genius in strategy, able to make quick decisions in the thick of the battle. He was able to snatch victory from the claws of certain defeat, time and again, always against overwhelming enemy superiority in numbers, always in a terrain that his enemies had carefully chosen to maximize heir advantages. Any city he ever attacked he conquered. His own father the great Philip II failed to take Byzantium, and was defeated by Thracian tribesmen, but not Alexander. He made land out of a sea and conquered the island city of Tyre, and he used rock climbers to take the Sogdian Rock, an impregnable citadel that was like an eagle\u2019s nest. He almost killed himself jumping into the Indian city of the Malians alone, a wound which weakened his body and eventually probably contributed to his death. He was simply FEARLESS! Like the Carthagenian Hannibal, and all ancient Greek military leaders, Miltiades, Epameinondas, Philip, etc, but unlike Napoleon, Genghis Han and others after him, Alexander was always leading from the front line. His soldiers adored him to death for another reason too: He was always winning decisively, decimating his opponents in battle, with only a handful of losses on his own side. They would follow him blindly knowing not only that victory was theirs, but that very of them would die in battle. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many good generals in world history. But the difference between great and good in my opinion is the ability to make those around you better. Alexander inherited a effective army. The Greek hoplite was the most powerful heavy infantry at the time. The Macedonian cavalry was a well trained and well disciplined forced. The Greek light infantry had also been forged in combat. No question Alexander had been given powerful tools. His father, Philip also called the Great, trained him for leadership in battle. From Philip he learned how to align his troops in battle. Aristotle was his teacher in the class room and taught him how to think and question things. When he cut the Gordian Knot he was able to think outside the box. He was also fearless in battle. But maybe the most important factor was his complete belief in his ability and the charisma to have all his army from the ranks to the generals also believe that he was invincible. ",

Unlike his father and unlike Cyrus the Great, Alexander was most afraid of how he would have been portrayed by Jewish and Egyptian scribes. And guess what! Images of him sporting two horns on his head didn\u2019t take too long to make. Other than that, Demosthenes summed him up better as, just another Macedonian upstart like his father. ",
