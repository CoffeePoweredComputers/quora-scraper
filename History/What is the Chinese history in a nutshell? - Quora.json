            "answer_text": "Modern humans appear and hunt for food.Then they realize that they have a common interest in not starving to death and so they hunt for food together.Someone discovers how to survive by raising more food from plants. He stops hunting all day and does that instead; when other people discover that he has more food, they join him and agree to work for him in exchange for more food.The person in charge dies, and his authority is passed over to his son.Who then hands it over to his son.Who then hands it to his son. Etc.Until the new person is an idiot who doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, and someone else violently overthrows him and puts his family in charge.And then his family stays in power until it doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing either and gets violently overthrown by another person and his family.And this cycle continues for another 2,000 years or so before someone gets that having families in charge isn\u2019t cool and overthrows the last family, who are replaced by a bunch of warlords who are then replaced by a bunch of intellectuals with guns.It\u2019s hard to sum up Chinese history \u201cin a nutshell,\u201d but if you want to go TL;DR, then you can think of it as the history of one family killing off another. Which isn\u2019t all that different from histories in a nutshell elsewhere tbh. ",

This is the first line of Romance of the Three Kingdoms. A grossly over-generalized and oversimplified description of Chinese history. It\u2019s so over-generalized and oversimplified to the point it\u2019s completely meaningless. But hey, sure makes witty one-liners for showing off at a dinner party to impress your other pseudo-intellectual friends, doesn\u2019t it?  There\u2019s no such thing as \u201c<insert country> history\u201d in a nutshell. History isn\u2019t something you can put in a nutshell and still somehow make sense. If you want to learn the history of something, anything, put in the time and effort and actually learn it. ",
