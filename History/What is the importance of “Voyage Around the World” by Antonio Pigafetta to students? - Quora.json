            "answer_text": "Taken from other writings on Quora. The voyage started out with 1200 men and six ships. They returned two years later with only one ship and a small number of men and only a small pile of spices in the hold, half of which was spoiled by sea water. The voyage was actually a commercial venture with investors. And the captain and crew needed to be paid. Would you have wanted to be one of the investors to such a limited success voyage? Every investor was paid 6 times his investment. That is how valuable spices were.  It is useful to know the events that led to today\u2019s world and the attitudes which preceded our current attitudes. It is also an account of an astonishing feat.Pigafetta is the best source of information on the first voyage around the world in 1519\u201322, an unprecedted feat of exploration and seamanship. Out of five ships, one came back. Out of 240 men, only a small number survived. Magellan's voyage paved the way for greater interactions between different parts of the globe. It was finally proven that the New World was its own continent rather than an extension of Asia; that there was an ocean between the two; and that resources of the Indies could be acquired through new means. Eventually this would lead to the first globalized trade between China, the New World, and Spain. Magellan's travels also give us the first accounts of new fauna such as penguins and seals found on the tip of South America. Antonio Pigafetta, a Venetian scholar who accompanied Magellan, records encounters with the indigenous peoples of South America and the Visayas. He discovered what is now called the Strait of Magellan. While the Strait presents problems for shipping it was at the time much safer than traveling around Cape Horn. The Cape route is fraught with horrible storms which gave sailing ships fits and claimed many ships. They then discovered (for Europeans as of course there were people already living there) the Pacific Ocean which they discovered was rather large. Some of what they discovered was that in fact that scientists and sailors were right and the Earth was round. It also discovered that the Earth was bigger than thought. The Greeks actually knew this mathematically. It opened trading to a large portion of the world they had never believed possible. It confirmed that the old route to the Spice Islands was in fact the shortest. ",
