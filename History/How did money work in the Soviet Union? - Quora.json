            "answer_text": "This is a great question, if you like history and economics, and a quite complicated one. If you do not have the time or patience to read the explanation below, the supershort answer is money in the Soviet Union worked in completely different ways than what you would consider \u2018normal\u2019. Some very good points are made by various authors in the discussion on a similar question here on Quora: Why didn't the USSR abolish money? I will try to provide an explanation, but it will be weird as a trip down the proverbial \u2018rabbit hole\u2019 or as standing on your head. That is because no matter where you live on this planet, you experience some form of market economy (unless we have some readers from North Korea or may be Cuba). The Soviet Union was a world that tried to deny the very nature of markets. For those Quorans who did not do any college level economics I encourage you to read the investopedia article on money and its functions. Money is much more that just bills or numbers in a bank ledger. Money Definition In general the role of money in an economy can be summarized in the following schematic  While this terminology is modern, the role and functions of money were well understood by the creators of the Soviet Union, as they have been profoundly researched by Karl Marx himself in his principal work Das Kapital. Soviet Union tried to achieve Communism - a scientifically designed society, where money should not, in theory, exist. Productivity should expand so much, that every wish of every person should be satisfied, apparently, through direct distribution. The fact that money did exist in the Soviet Union tells a story of failure to completely abolish market forces. However, as you will see, many of the functions of money from the table were abolished successfully. It had a longterm detrimental effect, but that was not known at the time, or at least not believed to be true. The communist problem with money resides mostly with its secondary and contingent functions, namely, money as store of value and money as a general form of capital. Both of those allow for a. accumulation of wealth, b. extraction of profit without work. These lead to inequality and exploitation, which obviously should be prohibited, if one is trying to build a just society of equal individuals. A cavalier attempt to abolish money right after the 1917 revolution and resort to direct redistribution of goods led to famine, violence, and Medeval style collection of grain and other goods from those, who produced it. It was quickly abolished and the Soviet ruble was introduced in the form of coin and bills, some other answers have pictures of those bills. So, market forces showed even the fanatical communists that one can not easily do without money\u2019s primary functions - as a medium of exchange and a measure of value. However, Communists were not deterred by their initial failure, they spent the next 60 years cutting away the various ways money is supposed to work. In short, one could say that Soviet money was tokenized. It was kept as a medium of exchange and a transfer of value. However, everything was done to destroy all its other functions. This was done using the following approaches: The state had a monopoly on foreign trade and exchange, thus disconnecting the internal money from any equivalents, which could somehow define its value in relative terms (as in market set dollar -euro exchange rates for example). Inside the country the state controlled all means of production, literally made everything. This allowed the state to stop using money as a measure of value. All prices were mathematical abstractions, mostly used to control consumption (theoretically until that wonderful time when productivity goes through the roof and we\u2019d need not worry about consumption any more). Prices for consumer goods were set by the State Central Planning Committee (Gosplan) once in 5 years. After that they could be conveniently stamped into products. This cooking pan is supposed to cost 80 kopecks (0.80 of a Soviet ruble)  Isn\u2019t wonderful? No matter where you are in a country spanning eight time zones, stuff costs the same, year round, and no profiteering by dishonest retailers! Thus, by using planned distribution of resources for production between factories that all belonged to the state, money was limited to an exchange medium among common people. It was also used as a transfer of value, for example when workers got paid their salaries and could later \u2018buy\u2019 groceries and goods for that. I am using it in quotation marks, since many items were never available for money in the USSR, they were directly distributed to people, frequently based on their rank and importance in society. Since state planning was eternally imperfect and downright useless in trying to forecast consumer demand (it shifted too much, as you all know, frequently due reasons which have no relation to economics), consumers experienced deficits on a regular basis. There were very primitive savings accounts by the State owned Savings bank. But having a lot or little money there did not allow you to solve all your problems. What is the use of money, if one could not buy anything with it? Obviously, all these distortions pushed the markets underground. Outside of the government eye one could buy everything there was to get in an impoverished country, but that was obviously illegal and at different times in Soviet history could mean fines, problems at work or actually bring a jail sentence. From a common person\u2019s perspective in the USSR money \u2018worked\u2019 like this: one got paid in cash bills for whatever work (s)he was doing. One could exchange those bills for some goods and services at state or local authority fixed prices, IF those were available at one\u2019s location. one could also return those bills to the savings bank and get 1% interest. It was purely symbolic, since prices were changed arbitrarily, the existence of inflation was denied. The government could also perform monetary reforms, exchanging \u2018old\u2019 rubles to \u2018new\u2019 at some fixed rate, 1 to 10 for example, with simultaneous rounding of all prices. People could NOT use money as capital to invest or start a business - creation of profit was a criminal offense. Life was organized in such a way, that an average person never accumulated much money or property, (s)he was provided with just enough to live and carry out ones function in society. Accumulating wealth was actively frowned upon, punished in extreme cases. ",

However the kulaks refused to grow food. They demanded payment with some kind of money. After a few million died of starvation. Lenin relented and passed the New Economic Plan in 1921. He minted silver coins but it was a temporary state of affairs. He subsequently printed paper rubles which were used to pay the kulaks.  Stalin took power and set up Fordson tractor factories in Leningrad in 1924 and Stalingrad in 1930. Stalin no longer needed & would exterminate the kulaks in the 1930s during the Holodomor.

Money is money,it doesnt change its use because of which country its in,it still does the same job. The only one difference was that there was one Central Bank not the many there is today & everybody was paid in cash. ",
