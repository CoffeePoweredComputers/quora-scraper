You might be able to rent something medium quality for a photo op, or something not very high in quality for one of those \u201cwalk the streets of (City Neighborhood) dressed as a Geisha (or more likely, Maiko).\u201d You\u2019re certainly not going to offend the people renting it to you, dressing you and taking your picture. I don\u2019t think anybody else will care. This is the country that invented CosPlay. ",

            "answer_text": "Paying to dress up as a geisha as a tourist experience is a fun thing that both foreigners and Japanese do and nobody thinks this is offensive. Pretending to actually be a geisha or using the title geisha without having trained as a geisha would be very offensive to any real geisha and damaging to the geisha profession. There have been foreigners who have claimed to be geisha although foreigners cannot legally work as geisha in Japan unless they have permanent residency. ",
