            "answer_text": "Plato opened up a world that was not very pervasive before him which is the 'World of Ideas'. He sees that every object has its essence and that these essences are part of a meta-physical world of Ideas. Also in Ancient Greek Philosophical tradition there is a pervasive view of an order; a single order where you have the 'Being' which is perfect and that there is the 'being' which is the becoming. The job was to reconcile these two views (now plato didn't necessarily wanted to reconcile but through his views there is a possiblity). The world of ideas although not tangible have a very 'ideal' notion in them which means the 'world of ideas' can be equated to the 'Being' (bear with me, this is just a possibility) and that things from which such essences are derived i.e. objects are the 'being'. When you have many soldiers who are quite different from all of them you can derive the essence of a soldier or how a soldier ought to be. So from the becoming you can derive the Being through recollection as it 'reveals' you about this 'Ideal'. Now when it came about the point of reality for Plato 'World of Ideas' were more real as they were ever-existent and higher than many objects from which the ideal is derived and also not to forget a 'revelation'. Hence, he wrote 'The Republic'. I would disagree on the way he places his realistic conditions for reasons I'd mention some other time but he is quite important for creating Ethics. For living a 'Good Life' you need Ideals and you need to find out many such ideals from this world which has just enlarged its scope. We need Human Ideals to help out those who are suffering and bring them to what they truly deserve to be. Societies need such Ideals which can keep them going on for a long-time to come and not be in deviation to the ideals. Our present Ethical world needs Plato's views so strongly, I suppose. That's his importance. ",

            "answer_text": "I know this question isn\u2019t meant to sound personal but it makes me feel personal. I adore Plato. I guess for me, I\u2019m coming from a completely different perspective in the sense that I studied Greek philosophy for a solid year of my life. Philosophy professors don\u2019t make a lot of money despite the fact that they may be the experts in their specialty. My professors loved the classes they taught and I could see the subject matter from their eyes. When lovers talk about their loves, it\u2019s passionate. When professors talk about their interests, it\u2019s passionate. I understood Plato enough that it\u2019s easy for me to like him. The progression is from Socrates to Plato to Aristotle. Socrates never wrote. He didn\u2019t believe in it. He could write. But he believes the basis for all knowledge was dialogue and all of his thoughts are written in the form of dialogues which are real conversations that were transcribed by his students. Socrates\u2019 contribution to the world was the Socratic method. The purpose of the Socratic Method was both to deduce a thesis of someone\u2019s perspective and to present or box a speaker into a logical contradiction of their own doing. Plato was Socrates student and later Aristotle was Plato\u2019s student. If you study all three of them, it\u2019s very clear the influence each had on their direct student. Plato was alive during a time where politics and public affairs was considered the greatest achievement of man. He talks a lot of morals and ethics. While Socrates\u2019 greatest contribution to society was his method for critical thinking, Plato\u2019s greatest contribution to society was illustrating how and why it\u2019s relevant. Plato advocated that critical thought and everyone applying it was relevant and necessary for a society to be well and morally governed. Aristotle never wrote books. Our writings of Aristotle take the form of his lecture notes from his classes. Aristotle was very practical in a very specific way. Socrates focused on the structure of thought and reason. Plato focused on the most appropriate application of thought and reason. Aristotle focused on the most appropriate route to becoming a perfect person capable of perfect thought and reason. ",
