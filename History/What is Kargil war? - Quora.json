            "answer_text": "As a layman, the Jammu and Kashmir State has Ladakh too as its important and Northern most part with Line of Control with Pakistan and Line of Actual Control with China.  The Ladakh Region is connected by National Highway 1 D to Leh from Kashmir Valley (Srinagar) which passes through a narrow stretch passing through valley of Kargil dominated from the Line of Control heights in the North.  The heights are in the range of 3\u20135000 m with heavy snowfall in winters making it difficult to maintain the summer posts. Hence opposing sides (Indian and Pakistani Army) withdraw as the snowfall starts to safer and lower heights and reoccupy these in summers. In 1999 Indian and Pakistan Army withdrew as scheduled but the Pakistanis not only reoccupied their posts but intruded deep inside Indian territory to occupy Indian posts too.  It was not a sudden move. They planned it for over a year and executed the secret operation gradually over the entire winters by creating infrastructure and logistics support to survive the winters and repulse Indian attempt to reoccupy their posts in summers as scheduled. The Build Up was as shown below.  This was done by the Pakistan Army Regular Soldiers in the garb of terrorists as infiltrators. Details of intrusion and their detection in summer months are as shown below. Pakistan named it as Operation Al Badar. This led to Indian Army Operation Vijay to reclaim the losses.   The Fight for the Heights commenced with Indian Counter Attack named Operation Vijay. The Fighting covered three Sectors-Drass, Kargil and Batalik. The Heights were retaken inch by inch.  Operation Vijay.  Overview of Kargil War  The climb was slow steady and steep for the Indian Soldiers.  But success was achieved at high cost. About 500+ Indian Soldiers laid their lives.   The Heroes who made it happen.  The Heroes laid to rest.  A War Memorial in the honour of martyrs.  Jai Hind !! ",
