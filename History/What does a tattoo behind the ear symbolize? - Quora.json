            "answer_text": "It's been said before but it would depend on the tattoo, the black widow is meaningful to me in the sense that it was the death of a phase of my life and I felt dead inside when my relationship was over and the way the male throws himself at the females jaws after copulation was apt, we had a very close and intense sexual relationship, I gave her my love, my virginity and all of my heart and soul and did my best by her and our kids and she chewed me up and left me feeling dead inside. As for being behind the ear? Thought it'd look cool there, it's a bold position for it, a bit more than a hand or neck tattoo but not as out there as having it right on my face!  ",

            "answer_text": "It means you\u2019ve lost someone close to you to death. Each of my tats have significance, on my left arm written the names of 2 of best friends who were murdered by their respective partners on my right my cousin who was killed by a drunk driver. Tats are extremely personal, no name should appear on your body unless it\u2019s in memory of or a tribute to your parents, or children. There are those who get names of those they are romantically involved with, 9 times out 10 stuck with that after the relationship ends, it\u2019s not too bright but to each their own. ",
