            "answer_text": "Pre-Saul Prophecy It depends on what you consider the first prophecies about the Lord: Genesis 3:15 And I will put enmityBetween you and the woman,And between your seed and her seed;He shall bruise you on the head,And you shall bruise him on the heel.\u201d Genesis 22:18 In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.\u201d Genesis 49:10 \u201cThe scepter shall not depart from Judah,Nor the ruler\u2019s staff from between his feet,Until Shiloh comes,And to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.11 \u201cHe ties his foal to the vine,And his donkey\u2019s colt to the choice vine;He washes his garments in wine,And his robes in the blood of grapes.12 \u201cHis eyes are dull from wine,And his teeth white from milk. Just after Saul\u2019s Death 2 Samuel 7:12 When your days are complete and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, who will come forth from you, and I will establish his kingdom. 13 He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. Most Messianic prophecy begins with the Psalms of David and then Isaiah in the 8th century B.C. two to three centuries after Saul. ",
