            "answer_text": "Eventually, yes, at least the bulk of the story. A number of researchers are methodically piecing it together. They think the military (CIA/ACSI) did it, and blamed it on Oswald. He was a pawn from the beginning, since his earliest days as a marine and the intelligence training he received. Oswald\u2019s background, his close affiliation with anti-Castro Cubans (DRE) in the year leading up to the assassination, and his statements after the fact suggest this. Someone who had an overwhelming drive to kill a commander in chief wouldn\u2019t say, \u201ci didn\u2019t shoot anyone\u201d or \u201cI am just a patsy\u201d after completing the impossible. So who did kill JFK, and why? All of the files, related to the assassination (or at least the House Select Committee\u2019s investigation) were to be released in Oct. of 2017. Thousands of documents were withheld. Files on David Sanchez Morales and David Atlee Phillips were the largest files held on to. They were high ranking CIA officers tasked with eliminating Castro, and are the prime suspects in turning that apparatus around\u2026 eliminating Kennedy, along with framing Oswald. These are also the individuals that were known about during the House Select Committee on Assassinations\u2026 other individuals like CIA officers Carl Elmer Jenkins and George Joannides were not known to investigators at all until the 90\u2019s, so their files are tightly held by the CIA and are under no mandate to ever be released. This is especially outrageous because Joannides was pulled out of retirement to act as the House Select\u2019s liaison to the CIA, telling them what to focus on and what to avoid, even though he is suspected of running the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE-AMSPELL) in setting up Oswald in New Orleans in the summer of \u201863. Other files are claimed to be missing, or are held in private. 22) Plausible JFK suspect: William K. Harvey Morley v. CIA Before the Supreme Court Some of the biggest revelations of what was released in 2017 (and years prior) revolve around the secret war against Cuba and the nature of how the anti-Castro operators were selected, funded, trained, organized and deployed. This was centered in the CIA Miami station JM/WAVE under William King Harvey, a CIA legend who hated both Kennedy brothers with a passion. Harvey built what has been described as a \u201cdark alliance\u201d of intelligence officers, elements of the mafia, ex-military contract soldiers, wealthy right wing industrialist backers, and Cuban exiles. All of them bound by a hatred for Castro and a vested interest in returning Cuba to the immensely profitable economic engine it had been for the previous 50 years. The new government was to be led by Manuel Artime (AMBIDDY-1). The specific project was run through JM/WAVE on a team called Task Force W overseen by Harvey. All code names for the Cuba project have an AM prefix. Specific teams have the same name, with numbers given to individual operators. (AMHINT, AMLASH, AMTHUG, AMHAZE, AMSPELL, AMOT\u2026)https://jfkfacts.org/a-true-soun... The CIA did a deep study on the German VALKYRIE plot to kill Hitler. They used this as a template for the plan against Castro. Under the VALKYRIE template, a CIA trained team of Cubans planned for a sniper attack (PATHFINDER) on Castro while he traveled in a jeep. The pathfinders would escape, and the assassination would be blamed on a deranged lone gunman. The Pathfinders were trained by Carl Elmer Jenkins and John \u2018I.W.\u2019 Harper THE SOF WILD BUNCH - Soldier of Fortune Magazine, and the teams were led in part by William \u2018Rip\u2019 Robertson, under the guidance of David Sanchez Morales. They trained to be inserted into Cuba prior to the invasion and eliminate Castro. The pathfinder teams were eventually folded into the AMWORLD program, a tightly controlled CIA ran anti-Castro project in Central America overseen by Rafael \u2018Chi Chi\u2019 Quintero (AMHAZE-2527/AMJAVA-4). Lamar WaldronValkyrie At Dealey Plaza - Updated  Pathfinder team members, completely off the grid in the months leading up to the assassination, and the prime suspects for Dealey Plaza were: Felix \u2018El Gato\u2019 Rodriguez Mendigutia (AMHAZE-2718/AMJOKE-1), Nestor \u2018Tony\u2019 Izquierdo (AMHAZE-2586), Carlos \u2018Batea\u2019 Hernandez Sanchez (AMHAZE-2523), Antonio Soto, Jorge Navarro (AMHAZE-2536), Victor Espinoza Hernandez (AMHAZE-2766/AMHINT-24), Frank Barnardino (AMHAZE-2512), John Koch Gene (AMHINT-26), and Gonzolo Herrara. These men, among others, were the CIA\u2019s alpha team of anti-Castro commandos. They were the first recruits in what was to become Operation 40 and Brigade 2506. They all lost friends and family members in the failed invasion. They had the crucial distinction of working directly under William \u2018Rip\u2019 Robertson, arguably the CIA\u2019s top Special Activities Division commando. Rip\u2019s men had his trust, and they had collectively risked their lives multiple times trying to liberate Cuba since 1961.  They had close connections to Operation 40 coordinator Jack Crichton, founder of the 488th Military Intelligence Reserve Unit which had control of the city of Dallas on the day of the assassination. They were highly trained, fanatic in their dedication, and thoroughly enraged with JFK\u2019s perceived betrayal at the Bay of Pigs and his secret peace negotiations with Cuba and the USSR. They had the means and the motive to eliminate the president, and the unconditional support of many powerful people who wanted Kennedy dead. Oswald did not, and was likely informing on them as part of his work with the FBI. Four of these men (John Koch Gene, Victor Espinoza Hernandez, Carlos Hernandez Sanchez, and Antonio Soto) were arrested at the La Combe, La. training camp on July 31, 1963 shortly after Lee Harvey Oswald visited. The camp was run by David Ferrie, another associate of Oswald\u2019s. showDoc.html  During this time (Nov. 27, 1963), another Carl Elmer Jenkins/Rip Robertson led team departed Baltimore for Costa Rica on a ship called the Joanne to participate in AMWORLD. They were referred to as the \u201cBlack Nine\u201d and were equipped with \u2018silenciadores\u2019 (high powered rifles with suppressors and scopes provided by Mitchell WerBell - AMBOAR) and Collins radios, much as the Dealey Plaza team is suspected of using. showDoc.html showDoc.html This team was led by Segundo Borges (AMHAZE-2667) and also included Felipe Silva Cadenas, Julio Yanez Pelegrin, Aramis Pinon Estrada, and Miguel Penton Alfonso. This is especially significant, because Carl Jenkins\u2019 original Pathfinder mission into Cuba in 1961 to kill Castro was led by Felix Rodriguez, Rafael Quintero and Segundo Borges.  It is conceivable that Felix Rodriguez led the pathfinder team in Dealey Plaza, and Segundo Borges led the pathfinder team that would once again target Fidel Castro in the expected invasion of Cuba following the Kennedy assassination\u2026 a mission that ultimately never materialized. Many, if not all, of the pathfinders were with the DRE (AMSPELL/AMHINT). Oswald was seen with members of the DRE in the summer of 1963, and it was the DRE who notified the press of Oswald\u2019s supposed connections to Castro on the day after the assassination. Felix Rodriguez\u2019 team resurfaced in January 1964. Many of the pathfinders then followed Rip Robertson to the Congo and/or Carl Jenkins to Vietnam and participated in the Phoenix program. Here\u2019s a photo of Rip with some of his Cubans in the Congo 11/22/64. The umbrella is a not so subtle hint at the source of their rage on the one year anniversary. Brigade 2506 was promised an umbrella of American air cover during the invasion. Kennedy\u2019s scaling down of the air cover, mid-invasion, doomed the exile army. They fought valiantly, but were out numbered 10 to 1.

            "answer_text": "The US government is NOT going to let the genie out of the bottle until we know the truth and rub their dirty little noses in their lies.  THEN the powers to be will come up first with more lies until someone with an honest streak says enough! A HISTORY CHANNEL poll in 2013 asked the question you are asking, will we ever know the truth about the JFK assassination.  89% of the people polled said NO, with answers like \"if we haven't figured it out by now, we never will.\"  One person said like Steven Franklin said in a response to YOU, even if we see the truth, will we believe it? In this link, I explain to someone else how to P R O V E what happened during the shooting.  Quit laughing and pay attention. There are TWO INDEPENDENT ways to determine the timing of the shots that were fired in Dealey Plaza.  IF BOTH ARE VALID, THEN THE TIMES BETWEEN SHOTS WOULD BE THE SAME IN BOTH METHODS, WHAT COULD BE SIMPLER?   This link is just an introduction and I address TWO of the intervals between three of the shots.  BECAUSE THESE TWO INTERVALS ARE THE SAME IN BOTH METHODS, IT MEANS YOU CAN COMBINE INFORMATION TO SOLVE THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.  If this were easy, Vince Bugliosi would have figured out the right answer. Have we come any nearer to knowing the truth behind JFK's assassination?  Bill Charleston ",
