            "answer_text": "Culture is a poorly-defined term. It probably survives because it enables discussion differences and variations for which there is no better terminology. If you could compare two examples of gross domestic product or traffic death statistics or tax rates, you would describe those comparisons as gross domestic product or traffic death statistics or tax rates. Culture picks up where better terminology runs out of explanatory power. \u201cCulture\u201d may not do a great job of shining a bright light on its subject matter. You could think of it as the linguistic equivalent of a white cane. Culture usually refers to the differences in the behavioral and cognitive norms that cluster geographically among people who share them. In the era of social media, it\u2019s easy to forget that for most of human history, people behaved mostly in relation to the people within social-contact range. It doesn\u2019t seem like a meaningful statement to say that corporate culture is \u201cdead\u201d. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s alive, well, and thriving everywhere, however. It just means that it hasn\u2019t disappeared and isn't likely to do so. As long as people work in groups, they will have to share resources, responsibilities, accountability, rewards, and sanctions.As long as people work in groups, they will almost certainly push decision-making responsibilities toward a few people instead of sharing decisions in some elaborate pattern that involves all the individuals in every decision.As long as group size grows with economic success, groups will grow and will require hierarchy, which means layers of managers or decision-makers.As long as people\u2019s personalities include a continuum of stimulation seekers and solitude seekers, social activity by individuals will never become identical. Rewards and disadvantages will never become identical either.Here\u2019s an analogy. I was head of HR at a company that had one of the first 401(k) plans in the U.S. We also had a matching contribution from the company as soon as we hit profitability. I discussed retirement and savings with a lot of employees who asked my advice. Sometimes they\u2019d say forthrightly, \u201cI don\u2019t have a retirement plan.\u201d In the most constructive tone I could muster, I\u2019d say something like, \u201cYes, you do.\u201d Sometimes they ask what I meant. whether they asked or not, I\u2019d say, \u201cYou\u2019re acting out a retirement plan right now by doing nothing about it. It may not be a great retirement plan, but it\u2019s your plan unless you decide do something different.\u201d Corporate culture works in a similar way. It follows a maxim I learned from one of my cultural anthropology professors: There is no such thing as a behavioral silence. Corporate cultures may have gotten worse in various ways. They may have gotten decentralized. They may have more efficient but less effective. They may be missing opportunities by the way they concentrate their decision-making authority. But, dead? Absent? MIA? Not a possibility. Every corporation that\u2019s not single-person Subchapter S corporation has a culture. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, corporate culture is not dead in the least. In fact, if you're working for an organization that doesn't have (the right kind of) one, doesn't value that, doesn't prioritize that, or frankly has the wrong kind of culture, then you're in the wrong place. I believe that corporate culture, properly defined, properly created, properly managed, is absolutely crucial. Every organization has a culture, whether it's purposely designed or happens by default, whether it bubbles up organically from the employees, or it's stone tablets from the mountain inflicted upon them by the higher-ups in the corner office, or anything in between, there is a corporate culture. Now, I'm not talking about the kind of high-tech Silicon Valley corporate culture with beanbags and free lunch and massages. I think those are contrived shiny objects. I think they're designed in a competitive landscape to attract new employees--they are signal-senders. They don't necessarily drive the culture. Culture is a combination from leadership, top down by definition, and organically bubbling-up from those who subscribe to that particular leadership model. When things happen organically by virtue of people's natural interactions, you have the beginning of a wonderful culture. When that is complementary to the leadership style and the vision of where the leaders want to take the organization, then you really have a great culture. But, keep in mind, this culture by definition may also be poor, bad, negative, it may be absolutely disastrous. An inefficient federal government has a culture, one that will smile and laugh about the lack of productivity and their inability to get things done.A high-tech, fast growth company has a cultureSome people can stand and live in, certain cultures some cannot.Do not underestimate the power of culture, and do not underestimate the need for it, nor your contribution to it positively or negatively. And if I may, don't stay long in a place that does not have the culture that you want, or where you cannot see a way to bend or change the arc of that culture with your positive contribution. But culture is not dead. Long may it live. ",
