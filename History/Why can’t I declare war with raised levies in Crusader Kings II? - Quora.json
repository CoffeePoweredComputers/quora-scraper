            "answer_text": "Whist this limitation really doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense realistically, just think how much of an advantage it would confer to the attacking party if this restriction was not in place. The attacker would be able to have all of their levies stacked up and ready to strike, while the defender would have to pull their troops from all over their realm. You can actually do something similar with retinues but that\u2019s beside the point, which is that the rule has to exist to make the game even slightly balanced. ",

            "answer_text": "Too darn easy. My favorite tactic was to assemble my retinue, start marching them into an (soon to be) enemy province, and when there's just 1 day of marching left - declare war and raise levies. It's an artificial limitation, but it does make the game fairer, in my opinion. ",
