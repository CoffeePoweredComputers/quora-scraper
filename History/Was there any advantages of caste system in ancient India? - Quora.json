            "answer_text": "Caste system did not exist in ancient India in the form we know it today. But caste structures exist today, as they did in the past. Let\u2019s look at the kShatropetA dvijAtayaH \u2014 because this is where the rot of today\u2019s caste system comes from (including the rot of the Dharmashastras such as Manusmriti). That should explain the advantages in being part of an organized system. Note 1: It is certainly a falsity to claim that \u2018hinduism is not an organized religion\u2019. The Smarthas are an organized people, following an organized religion with a mutt head.So, who exactly were kShatropetAs claiming to be Dvijas? There have been deliberate misconstructions, to portray them as \u2018those who composed mantras\u2019 (if that were the definition of a brahmana, there certainly are no brahmana descendants amongst southern Indians today, despite the tiny population which claims to be brahmana). When one reads from books it is better to also read between the lines, or use some sense before interpreting. Just because Mr.Z likes to portray himself as someone of \u2018high\u2019 birth, who descended from certain ancestors, and gets things composed to suit his position, does not mean those compositions tell the whole truth. The very term kShatropeta surfaces in the Mahabharat and in the Puranas; and it referred to the military class which put up the pretense of hailing from rishi ancestors. This military class could have any origin, including a Shudra origin. To understand this historically, lets take the example of Pushyamitra Sunga in whose reign Manusmriti was composed. Pushyamitra Sunga claimed to be of Bharadvaja gotra, a branch of the Angirasas. However, H.C.Raychaudhuri, Jayaswal, R.P.Chanda, P.Banerjee, and few other historians who examined the origins of Sungas comment on Audbhija Kashyapadvija Senani who was Pushyamitra himself. Audbhija means upstart, or someone who upstaged / backstabbed others to become the king. Before he upstaged the Mauryas and became a king, Pushyamitra as Kashyapadvija Senani belonged to Kashyapa gotra with the family name Baimbika. However later when Pushyamitra seized power and became king, he portrayed himself to be of Bharadvaja gotra and took on the family name Sunga (bcoz the Samyus were Kshatropetas and the new family name suited his new gotra). This is not uncommon, because throughout history people have taken on names, gotras. family names and varnas to suit their social position. Some dynasties, even in the late medieval period, openly declared to have originated from the Shudra class but underwent Hiranyagarbha to claim Kshatriya status for themselves, but it lasted only until the time they were in power. Once they lost power they were back to being Shudras; or they could become priests and claim to be Brahmanas, else they could claim to be traders and hence Vaishyas. It all depended on who was in power, at that point. Note 2: If Smartha law officers did not exist in British courts pronouncing varnas on others, majority would have classed themselves as brahmans (and rightly so).Pushyamitra chose Bharadvaja as his gotra because the family occupation of a branch of Angirasas was military tradition. Mythically, this came about because Bharadvaja, an Angirasa descendant, was adopted by Bharata (the son of Shakuthala and Dushyant) and thus the Paurava line of Bharatas continued from him. This itself puts a question mark on the descent and the claims since Bharadvaja was not the biological son of Bharata. Moreover, there was no necessity for Bharata to adopt Bharadvaja. Nevertheless, every other Purana will portray, justify and have people believe that Bharadvaja can be either a Brahmana or a Kshatriya. Just that all of them chose to be called Brahmana in those very puranas itself, and rarely did anyone call himself a Kshatriya!! Matsya Purana and Vayu Purana state it so obviously. Matsya Purana claims tasmaadapi bharadvaajat brahmanaah khshatriya bhuvi to imply that Bharadvaja descended from both Brahmanas and Kshatriyas. Not only that, anyone who could brahmanize himself claimed to be of Bharadvaja gotra with Angirasa as his origin (pravara). This included a large pool of people including the grandsons of Brihaspati such as Gargas, Suhotras, Naras, Sunahotras, Rijishvans, etc. These who originally belonged to Brihaspatya gotra could also claim to be Bharadvajas; and apparently this switch as per P.Banerjee could even be attributed to Rigveda which obviously is a far stretch of claim because puranic gotras did not exist in the vedic period. Yet, it is worthwhile to note that a very huge pool of people were categorized in the Puranas as Kshatropeta Dvijas, and these included the Kanvas, Vishnuvriddhas, Shaunakas, Maudalyas, Haritas, Kapis, Urukshayas, Priyamedhas, Pauravas, Ikshvakus, etc, and historically it included the Pallavas, Vakatakas, Kanvas, Shatavahanas, Kadambas, Vishnukundinas, Gangas, Brihatphalayanas, Andhra Ikshvakus, Salankayanas, etc. Also compare this with how the Pallavas brahmanized themselves, after coming to power. In the Nedungarayu Plates of Prince Visnugopa it is stated in the opening line that the Pallavas attained Brahminhood while they were Kshatriyas (Cadambi 1977, p.36 and Pillay 1979, p.272). After they lost power, they became Shudras. Perhaps this is why Pushyamitra is called base-born after he lost power. Karma, truly, knows to bite back. Takeaways Basically, what one gets out of the caste system is Outsiders like Indo-Scythians / Sakas, anti-vedic classes, could acculturate themselves into becoming brahmins. First start off as Shudra non-entities, then upon seizing land claim to be Kshatriyas, then after establishing power for long enough claim to be brahmans. After losing power, it depended on the new kid on the block. If the new winner (example: Chola) enslaved his enemy, the Pallava went back to becoming a Shudra. If the winner banished his enemy it totally depended on the vagaries of time and circumstance what the \u2018state enemy\u2019 made out of himself elsewhere. Switching gotras, or conjoining them, adopting new gotras was always in vogue all through the feudal period, as long as a group stayed in power.If the puranas are to be believed, nearly everyone categorized under middle-castes, OBC, MBC, in southern India today would come under the Kshatropeta category. In Karnataka this would include the Gowdas / Vokkaligas, Kurubas, and various former cattle-herding classes. In Maharashtra this would include the Marathas including farming communities like Kurmi, Kunbi, etc. In Andhra, this includes the Kapus and their branches Velama, Reddy, Balija, Telaga, Kamma, and so on. In Tamil nadu this includes the Vellalars, Vanniyars, Nadars, etc. In Kerala this includes the Nairs a branch of which till date trains in Abhichara (ritualism) of Atharva as Angirasas. It just happens that the former Atharvans were suppressed when the Yajur rose in power. There is also a contention that the former Atharvans were suppressed into Shudra classes at the end of the Brahmana period. That means those who were Kshatropetas in the early Puranic period did not necessarily remain so by the late medieval period. When out of power, they could very well have become Shudras (as it happened to be so in Southern India). If the Puranas are right, it would explain why these middle-castes are Agamic. That would also necessitate the question, who the new Smartha claimants actually are.Fact that so many rulers claimed to be Kshatropeta simply means the winner had a choice to position himself thus, just as Bharadvaja could position himself as the adopted son of Bharata. Constructing a genealogy to lend credibility to a ruler persisted since the itihasic period into the late-medieval period.\u2018Advantages\u2019 A Kshatropeta had his \u2018advantages\u2019. So does the caste system today. Back in the Itihasic and Puranic period Kshatropetas are comparable to a band of robbers swooping down on hapless populations to conquer their land and impose their laws on them. This explains why the middle-castes in their head still practice casteism. Instead of giving it up under a democracy in 21st century, they are easily swayed by nationalist politics and become worse as casteists instead. The advantages in the ancient period was like i take care of your back, you take care of mine. In today\u2019s world it is like, i promote you because you are from my caste. But nobody, just nobody, is willing to examine his own family\u2019s history or origin. All they want is some glorious, make-believe, ancestry. Never mind that gotras and surnames could be switched. And each one of them likes to think he is holy, divine, descended from pious blameless ancestors, is a respectable, honorable person. This despite the fact that they still practice casteism. That too of a form that entitles them to assume a make-believe glory for themselves by birth, with no effort required (perhaps it is a type of mental illness, like megalomania).
