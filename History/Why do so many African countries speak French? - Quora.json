            "answer_text": "France has been a colonial power since their expansion into the Caribbean and North America in the 16th and 17th century. The first French colonies were in the St. Lawrence river valley in continental North America. Through various treaties, the French had a territorial claim by 1700 that stretched from Louisiana all the way north along the Mississippi basin and the Great Lakes to Canada (Quebec, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, etc). The French influence remains today in the Cajun culture in the South, and in a lot of place names in central USA (St. Louis, the Ozarks, Baton Rouge, Lafayette, and many more). Also in the 17th century the French expanded into the Caribbean, including the Caribbean islands of Haiti, Guadeloupe, Dominique, Martinique, St. Kitts, and Saint Lucia, and French Guyana in South America. This expansion required a lot of manpower, and the cultivation of cocoa, sugar cane, and tobacco fuelled the slave trade in the 17th through to the 19th century, with most of the slaves coming from West Africa, from areas including modern day Senegal, Cameroon, and the Congo, and as a result established large trading posts, both for trade of goods, and for slave transport. As France\u2019s empire lost some power, it also lost several of its colonies during the 1700s, but after the French revolution and the Napoleonic wars, regained a lot of its territory from the British. France\u2019s colonisation of North Africa started in earnest around 1830, when the French invaded Algeria. They also added Ivory Coast (1843) and Gabon (1839) in West Africa. Napoleon III (president from 1848 to 1852 in the 2nd Republic, declared himself Emperor in the 2nd Empire from 1852 to 1871) led a massive expansion of the French empire, including the annexation of Senegal (1854). Most of the French expansion of this period was in Asia (Indochina, India). After Napoleon III\u2019s defeat in the Franco-Prussian war in 1871, and the establishment of the 3rd Republic, French expansion continued with the establishment of the French Congo (1880), the invasion of Tunisia (1881), Mauritania (1902), French Sudan (1883), French Guinea (1891), Chad (1900), Madagascar (1896), and Morocco (as a protectorate, in 1912). The First World War caused a lot of territorial upheaval, but at its end, France had added further territories including Togo (1918), and Cameroon (1918). After the 2nd World War, that empire crumbled, as France lost a lot of its former power - often in bloody wars, as in Algeria in the 1950s. But it left behind a significant portion of Africa where French is spoken as a first or second language, and a steady flow of immigrants from North and West Africa to France. In addition to France\u2019s conquest in Africa, Belgium\u2019s bloody reign over the Belgian Congo (today the DRC) from 1885 is worthy of mention. King Leopold II agreed a treaty with the British and the French to take possession of the Belgiam Congo \u201cto bring civilisation and christianity to the savages\u201d, and proceeded to run the country as a forced labour camp for its rubber trees (used in the massive expansion of the fabrication of tyres with motorization), which resulted in about 10 million deaths (out of a population of about 20 million) in the 30 years from 1880 to 1910. There are many documented atrocities which happened during this reign, which are still denied or minimised today. As with all colonising government, cultural assimilation was important to the French. All education was in French, all administrative services were provided only in French, and the local populations had little choice but to learn the language. In places like Vietnam or Pondicherry, it can be very difficult to find anyone who can actually speak the language, such was the rejection of the French culture after the end of colonisation. In North Africa, French is still a popular second language (after Arabic), because of proximity and a large Arabic population in France. In West Africa, it has continued to be useful to have a single shared language which all people can speak, in countries which were essentially European creations, with no respect for native languages or tribal boundaries. This may help to explain why French has survived so well in large parts of Africa, where its usage has declined in other former colonies. ",

            "answer_text": "French is used in many African countries today because of the history of colonialism. France and Belgium colonized West and Central Africa (and also several islands in the Indian Ocean close to southeastern Africa) and brought the French language with them. It was the language of administration for those areas as long as France and Belgium were in control. Both countries eventually relinquished those territories but left behind the French language as the language of choice in government and education. While under a Belgian and French rule, African tribal and regional languages continued to exist as they were integral to the cultural identity of the various people groups. Today, most of the countries with colonial ties to France and Belgium continue to maintain French as one of the official languages especially for diplomatic reasons and sometimes have a local tongue from the dominant tribe as its national language or a second official language equal to French, especially if it is a written language. There are hundreds of localized languages which continue to exist today. The people who use them find it important in order to maintain a part of their cultural heritage. I need to mention that Algeria is a special case. France intentionally tried to make Algeria an exact copy of France in every respect \u2026 educationally, governmentally, culturally. The Algerians eventually rebelled in the 1950's and forced the French to leave. (The Caucasian French whose history is directly tied to living in Algeria during those years are called \"Black Foot\" or \" Pieds Noires\") Many of the problems France face today with Muslims in France began with their historical policy toward Algeria.
