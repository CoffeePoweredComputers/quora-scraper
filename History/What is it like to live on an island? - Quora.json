            "answer_text": "My family is from an island, has a vacation home on an island, and most of my family members, including myself, continue to live on various islands primarily on the East Coast. Island life boils down to a love of boating, fishing, and other water sports and activities. There is always something to do on the water, if the weather cooperates, and a water view provides a front row seat to an ever changing nature show. Sometimes the weather/nature show can be harsh. Coastal flooding, storms, and hurricanes are a constant, albeit mostly seasonal, risk. I\u2019ve cleaned up after two floods and four hurricanes and find it is still a good trade for the benefits of island living. The key is good insurance and get off the island for large weather events, which can typically be forecasted days ahead. Note, bridges are often shut down during storms so always have an exit plan. The other side of island life is community. Islanders tend to behave much like your average small town. Sometimes, what happens on the island stays on the island, but generally everyone knows your business and it\u2019s tough to hide or keep secrets. The larger the island the less this is true, but I personally have told my kids when they are shocked that I know something they did, \u201cremember we live on an island!.\u201d So, it can be a great environment for raising kids. In fact, my kids often kayaked versus biked to friend\u2019s homes. As the world warms, island living may lose its appeal and real estate, so enjoy it while it lasts! ",

            "answer_text": " I grew up drinking bottled pop, bottled by the defunct Seaman's Beverages, not canned pop, for reasons described by the CBC. The ban was put in place in 1984 to protect jobs at the local Pepsi bottling plant and to protect the environment. The province also banned pop from being sold in plastic bottles. It's the way a whole generation of Prince Edward Islanders quenched their thirst, unless they brought back canned pop from the mainland, which Islanders did by the trunkful. For a kid, a can of pop in a lunch box was a status symbol. It was pressure from Islanders themselves that convinced the new government to end the can ban, which became a campaign issue in the provincial election last May. The lifting of the ban has been twice delayed while details of the deposit and return system for cans were worked out. A Charlottetown radio station will mark the occasion Saturday with a huge celebration in the city. The ban was lifted in 2008. The provincial government opted to end the long anti-can tradition on the grounds that, in a \"province [that] has seen rapid growth in the number of non-carbonated drinks such as water, juices and sports drinks available in cans and plastic bottles in the province[,] the province could no longer prohibit certain beverages from being sold in cans and bottles, while millions of cans and plastic bottles of these other drinks are already being sold.\" And since bottles are an archaic technology, why produce them at all? The ban was enforced to the end--a can dealer was busted in March of that year for trying to break the ban early. Whenever I tell people that I grew up in a province where you couldn\u2019t buy canned pop, where you had to literally go to another province to buy canned pop and this was a big exciting adventure, they usually look at me for a moment. Is he joking? No, he is not. Wow. That such a minor factor in their lives could be something that other people not too far removed by see fit to legislate against it is something that they find difficult to believe. And yet, it was: I share this photo, and the blog posts I wrote around this subject, and my source article. This is real, something that the Island government legislated and something that Islanders supported doing. Why does this matter? Prince Edward Island is, as its name indicates, an island. More, as a Canadian province, it\u2019s capable of being more self-governing than many islands. My experience of growing up on an island, on a small and territorially-bounded territory with home to people intimately familiar with each other and with their dependence on the wider world, is that people will go to extraordinary efforts to make sure that nothing will appear to go wrong. If you can prop up local industries and avoid the potential for unsightly littering with a single measure, then this measure will be enacted into law no matter how silly the mainlanders think it. (Indeed, it might be sustained because of mainlander opinion.) What matters, if you live on an island, is what other islanders think. Sometimes, especially if you live on a small island, it\u2019s all that matters. You just have to carry yourself accordingly. ",
