            "answer_text": "Very good question. Imperialism is often listed as one of the main reasons for World War I, and for good reason. Basically, it is inseparable from all the other contributing factors. To break it down, by 1914, Europe had become divided into a series of competing power blocs. These included the French Empire, the British Empire, the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Russian Empire, and the Turkish Empire. To ensure their survival, these empires entered into alliances with each other based on what they saw as their common enemies and interests. After losing the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, France feared a united Germany being on its doorstep. And so, they entered into a secret alliance with Russia, who also feared how a united Germany might threaten them. Germany, feeling similarly threatened, entered into an alliance with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This seemed like a natural alliance to Germany\u2019s rulers, who had long-standing cultural and historical ties to Austria\u2019s Hapsburg monarchy. Unfortunately, it also meant Germany inherited all of Austria-Hungary\u2019s problems in the Balkans. Chief among these problems was the newly-independent and expanding state of Serbia. Serbia had won its independence in 1910 from the Turkish empire and was looking to expand its borders at the expense of Austria-Hungary. The reason for this was because millions of ethnic Serbs lived under Austro-Hungarian rule in the province of Bosnia. Naturally, Austria-Hungary didn\u2019t want to lose territory and was sick of revolutions and reform. Under no circumstances would they allow Bosnia (or pats thereof) to break away and join Serbia. Russia had also aligned with Serbia during the 19th century after it had gained its independence from the Turks. This was based on cultural and historical ties, and Russia even saw itself as the \u201cdefender of the Slavic peoples\u201d. In this respect, Russia inherited Serbia\u2019s problems in the Balkans, foremost of which was its rivalry with Austria-Hungary and its chief ally, Germany. Turkey was concerned about losing territory in the Balkans. By the early 20th century, a series of uprisings and wars caused them to lose control of Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, Bulgaria and Romania. Fearing further decline, and facing Russian competition for control of the Bosphorus Strait (the gateway between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea), they began to align themselves with Austria-Hungary and Germany. Britain was still the largest empire on the planet at this time, but they were also feeling threatened. After Germany became united in 1871, its rulers began to dream of overseas expansion and securing colonies in Africa, Asia and the South Pacific. This put them at odds with the French and British, and Germany began building a powerful navy to protect their interests abroad. Britain saw this as a challenge to their naval supremacy. As you can see, this created a massive problem of entanglements. When Archduke Franz Ferdinand (crown prince of Austria-Hungary) was murdered in Sarajevo by Serbian terrorists, Austria-Hungary saw it as an opportunity to wage war on Serbia. Russia naturally became involved and demanded Austria-Hungary be restrained. But Germany, wanting a chance to break out of encirclement and committed to their ally, refused and threatened Russia instead. Russia was forced to mobilize, which led to Germany declaring war on them. Germany feared France would become involved, as per its alliance, and mobilized to the French border. After a series of border clashes, Germany declared war and invaded through Belgium. This brought England into the war under the pretext of protecting Belgian neutrality, but also because they feared that a German victory would drastically alter the balance of power in Europe. I hope this illustrates the point clearly enough. Europe\u2019s imperial competition had always led to conflict at home, but prior to the 20th century, the conflicts tended to be limited in scope. But by 1914, advances in technology and the development of mass armies meant that total warfare would be inevitable. Nationalistic and pseudo-scientific racial theories also had the effect of poisoning international diplomacy. The stage was therefore set for a long, terrible war where no one (not even the technical victors) felt like they had won. ",

            "answer_text": "Major countries were all imperialistic,they used them for strategic and economic advantages. Germany on the other hand just became a country in the late 19 century and wanted colonies. They wanted to defeat countries like France and Britian and take their colonial possessions around the world. They just looked at Great Britain and wondered how that small island nation was the superpower of its time. It came to the conclusion that their influence on the world was via its colonial possession. Woodrow Wilson would advocate for self-determination and decolonization. The colonization paradigm was dying. Wilson had an opportunity to meet with Ho Chi Minh the great powers would not see him. Wilson would not have pushed for surrender of French Indochina because Clemenceau would not have accepted it and Wilson sclerotic brain was focused on the League of Nations. And academic he always thought you could talk rationally with others and resolve unresolvable conflicts. It was quite na\u00efve ",
