            "answer_text": "Children must be taught to read, understand, and critically examine all information before arriving at any conclusion \u2014 NOW \u2014 more then ever \u2014 as a global pandemic ravages lives and economies and governments are in disarray across the globe most if not all unable to respond appropriately to this crisis. Children need these literacy skills for many reasons, but primary among them is self preservation. Children need to make sense of their new reality. They need to distinguish what is unproven, what is true, and what is false. They need to examine sources of information as well as the information itself\u2026 Marshall McLuhan - Wikipedia famously observed: \u201cthe medium is the message\u201d and today\u2019s children have an unprecedented need to know this: the medium must be examined for ownership and bias of its information. This ability to digest information and make informed conclusions cannot occur without exceptional focus on childhood literacy. So, once the ABC\u2019s are recognized and learned, and all phonograms are read with fluency, and once fluency is increasing well, and students can comprehend what it is they are reading, it is time to examine the information being expressed in whichever medium provides it. This is what is called \u201ccritical thinking skills.\u201d First, identify the message: what assertions are being made, and what information is cited to support conclusions which are proposed in any published \u2018message\u2019? Next, examine the source: which medium provided the information? What other information is this medium responsible for publishing? What biases could possibly be recognized? Are the owners of the medium \u201cfriends\u201d with the subject of the report? If so, how could that \u2018friendship\u2019 impact the report? If not, are other biases possible? If so, what could these biases be? Then, conclude whether the message is one which is reliable. Why or why not? Which information most impacted your conclusion/opinion? Why? Finally, adopt or reject the message and the medium.  Parents of toddlers can begin when reading fictional stories: \u201cIs this true, that Strega Nona\u2019s spaghetti pot can keep filling up all by itself?\u201d And when children are ready, parents can pursue this line of reasoning every day. \u201cHow do we know that?\u201d is a good question to ask, as young children state lots of assertions \u2014 and this question asks them to examine their inputs.  IF we do not have children who are literate AND capable of higher-level thinking skills, as described above, we cannot have an informed citizenry capable of effective self-governance. That means they will inhabit a world in which they are controlled by others. Nobody wants that for their children. Or for our world. ",

            "answer_text": "My answer is a little different from the others, although I certainly agree with the respondents.  Many of the jobs that will exist in 20 years do not exist now. As we as a human race progress intellectually, we create new and different jobs to match those creations. For example, the proliferation of drones means someone has to be able to build them, program them, collect data from them, repair them, store them\u2026and 20 years from now, who knows what will be developed? My suggestions include teaching students to brainstorm together and be able to create concepts that might be innovative. We need to teach students the benefits of how to persuade others about ideas. We need to make sure they not only know governance, but how it can develop for the good of the world. We need to make sure people know where they are in the world, and what and where other countries and cultures are. The more we have instantaneous communication, the more we need to know about our global community. I have often said as an example that you don\u2019t necessarily need to know the longitude and latitude of Chad, but you should know it\u2019s in Africa. But we also need to develop a generation of people who know how to fix things, cook things, shop for things. We need to assure that students know how to write poems, read and think critically, make and appreciate music and theater, dance and arts. We need to help coming generations interact peacefully with each other\u2014not have the same opinions or beliefs, but to respect differences. Traditionally we were trained to be productive citizens of an industrial world that no longer exists. It isn\u2019t coming back, and the needs of tomorrow\u2019s world are different and, in many ways, unknown. But the ways we work together have changed, and this can be included in curricula all over.
