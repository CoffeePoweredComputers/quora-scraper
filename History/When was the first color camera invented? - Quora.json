            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. You asked: When was the first color camera invented? The first \u201ccolor camera\u201d was invented in 1950. It was a television camera. The first \u201ccolor camera\u201d for still photography was invented by Eastman Kodak in 1976. \u201cBut,\u201d I hear you saying, \u201ccolor pictures were taken well before 1976!\u201d That is absolutely correct, but they were taken by film cameras, which use film as the sensor. In these cameras, it\u2019s the film that makes the difference, not the camera. I can load Kodak Portra into a film camera and take color pictures. I can load Kodak Tri-X into the very same film camera, and end up with black and white pictures. The first color photograph was taken on three sensitized plates through a red, a green, and a blue filter in 1861 using a technique we now call color separation. It was of a tartan ribbon. The Autochrome process used colored starch grains for color filtering; the film was exposed through the starch grains, then processed; a light was shone through the film and projected on a screen to give the final image. It was invented in 1907. The first commercially successful 3-color, single strip color film using a subtractive color model was Kodak\u2019s Kodachrome, invented in 1935 and produced in various forms until 2009. ",

            "answer_text": "The first color camera was the first camera which was later called a camera obscura (darkened room). There are mentions in Chinese literature in the 4th century BC. They almost certainly existed before that. A small hole in a tent would cast a color image on the opposite wall of the tent. The leaves in trees create multiple pinholes that cast images on the ground. This image was created during a solar eclipse:  Early cave paintings may have been inspired by pinhole images. The first color camera that could record an image was also a camera obscura. The recording was supplied by people who traced the image with whatever drawing implements they had at the time. The first color camera that could record a color image without requiring people to trace it was also a camera obscura. Some of them still exist. If you put a color sensor (film or digital) in it, it will record a color image. The first color image recorded by something other than tracing was the James Clerk Maxwell experiment that produced an image of a Tartan ribbon in 1861. Photo scientists still argue about this one. spectral sensitizing dyes did not exist at the time. Silver halide would record blue light. If it had enough iodide in it it would record some green light. There is no known way it could record red light. The best guess is that the red part of the ribbon also reflected UV and the red filter used in this additive system transmitted UV. We don\u2019t have much information about the camera used for this experiment. It would have been a typical view camera of the day. ",

            "answer_text": "The first color image that survived till our days was made in 1872, produced by the process author Louis Ducos du Hauron in France, but apparently there were earlier images and records that the first one was produced in 1869.  The first commercially viable color process (plates, too) was introduced by Lumiere brothers in 1907, it was called Autochrome and enjoyed moderate popularity till 1930s and the advent of Agfachrome and Kodachrome (1935). In the early 20th century there were other means, like Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky\u2019s triad process that used three black-and-white negatives (separate images side by side one one plate with parallax correction of lenses) exposed through red, green and blue filters. Then the plates were either projected the same way or were converted to lithography and printed. Then, since the early 1920s and until 1994 the process was forgotten, but once a chap in the Library of Congress decided to scan these negatives and combine channels in Photoshop. Since the original images were black-and-white, colors did not degrade in any way, contrary to processes that use this or that kind of color dyes. So thanks to that method (that was originally German but Prokudin-Gorsky perfected it) we can now see Russia and Central Asia from 100+ years ago in full and true color. ",

            "answer_text": "When was the first color camera invented Before digital cameras any camera could take black and white or color photographies depending on the tipe of film used and /or the procedures used.The first color media, around 1907, was the Lumiere Autochome, it produced a rather dark aditive transparency. It was basically a black and white image superposed with a tricolor matrix through which it was exposed. A printed blue, red and green matrix in the last versions. The first color film with three superposed color layers, yellow, cyan and magenta was the 1937 Kodakchrome. Before this it was possible to take three black and white negatives through red, green and blue filters. The negatives were developed and though diferent procedures a color positive was obtained. A process called color transfer was used by Techicolor to produce in 1935 the first full color movie. The Technicolor camera was able to expose the three negatives simultaneouly, it can be said it was the first camera, a movie camera, made specially to produce color images. For an example of the three negative process usedin static photogrsphy search in the web for \u201c1910 color photos in Russia\u201d. In this case the three negatives are not simultaneous so,if anything moves between exposures color halos will appear. ",

            "answer_text": "Cameras don\u2019t make color, it\u2019s the film. Ever since the first daguerreotype was made in Paris in 1839 people wanted to see color photographs. Throughout the \u201cpictorialist\u201d era photographic artists began playing with toned and manipulated prints to give them a color feeling. Hand painted photographs date back to the first albumen prints of the 1800\u2019s as well. However that first Kodachrome that became synonymous with color photography was not invented until 1935. Technicolor was a process that used 3 separate black and white camera negatives exposed through red green and blue filters then combined in the post process to create a color film. That process began around the end of WWI and was perfected with films like \u201cGone With The Wind\u201d, a classic early color film that still shines as a magnificent example of the early tech. Kodak eventually developed a negative film that would record color on one plate by using die-coupling, a technique that also exposes 3 black and white layers, however each layer is also embedded with a dye so when the silver is stripped only color is left remaining. That C-41 process is still alive today and constitutes the vast majority of current color mechanical photography. ",

The process came out of the lab in the 1870s, and some different methods were invented and being used in scientific attempts to shoot color. However the first cameras built to take color pictures was in the 1900\u20131910s.

Early trials on color photos were done on the 19th century taking several images with different filters and then combining the images. This worked only on completely static subjects. French Autochrome Lumiere introduced in 1907 was one of the first color films. The method had a problem that the color particles were not on top of each other but side by side somewhat like on modern displays but more random. This reduced the resolution.  \u201cModern\u201d color films were developed in the 1930s by Kodak and Agfa. Still it took up to 60s for color to become common in casual photographers. ",
