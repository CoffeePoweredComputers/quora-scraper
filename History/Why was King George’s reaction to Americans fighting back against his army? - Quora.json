            "answer_text": "Shortly after the Revolutionary War, a British father of 15 sat down to think about the world \u201cturned upside down.\u201d He had never seen the American continent, and rarely set foot outside London. But his private papers reveal that he closely tracked the war\u2019s path in maps and regiment lists. A man of routine, he dated his daily letters to the minute as the conflict raged on. He tried hard to picture the England that his children would inherit. \u201cAmerica is lost! Must we fall beneath the blow?\u201d he wrote in a neat, sloping hand. \u201cOr have we resources that may repair the mischiefs?\u201d These were the words of George III\u2014father, farmer, king\u2014as he weighed Britain\u2019s future. Many Americans, as colonists-turned-citizens, might have been surprised to hear George\u2019s inner thoughts on the war that brought about their new nation. He was, after all, the same ruler that revolutionaries had blisteringly indicted in the Declaration of Independence. There, they called George a \u201cPrince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant,\u201d one whom they deemed \u201cunfit to be the ruler of a free people.\u201d Over the centuries, popular culture has depicted \"America's last king\" in critical fashion. His illness steered the plot of Alan Bennett's 1991 play, The Madness of George III. More recently, the hit musical Hamilton pictured George III penning a breakup letter to the colonies, titled \"You'll Be Back.\" Now, for the first time in over two centuries, you\u2019ll be able to read the king\u2019s side of the American Revolution and its aftermath from the comfort of your own castle. George III\u2019s essay on the loss of the colonies is part of a private cache totaling more than 350,000 pages, all currently preserved in Windsor Castle\u2019s Royal Archives after a century or so of storage in the cellar of the Duke of Wellington\u2019s London townhouse. In April 2015, Queen Elizabeth II formally opened the trove to scholars, along with plans for the Georgian Papers Programme to digitize and interpret documents for a new website, launching in January 2017. Only a portion of the material, roughly 15 percent, has ever been seen in print. A sea of letters, royal household ledgers and maps abound for researchers to explore. And George III is not alone: Though the bulk of the archive documents his reign, it also contains documents that outline the political and personal views of several British monarchs and their families between 1740 and 1837. Why open up the once-private royal archive? The Georgian papers are \u201cabsolutely key to our shared past,\u201d says Oliver Urquhart Irvine, Royal Librarian and assistant keeper of the Queen\u2019s Archives. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about us. It\u2019s important to see George III\u2019s relationship to science, to agriculture, to family and domestic life, to women, to education, and to all kinds of subjects.\u201d Past scholars have framed the age as one of Enlightenment and revolutionary tumult. But though founding-era figures like John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and others anchor the American side of the saga with their candid correspondence, George III's views have not always been so tantalizingly within reach. By 2020, the Georgian Papers team will make all material relating to Britain's Hanoverian monarchs freely available in digital format. \u201cWe fully expect this project to lead to discoveries that will transform our understanding of the 18th century,\u201d says Joanna Newman, vice president and vice-principal (International) at King\u2019s College London. In collaborative spirit, Windsor archivists have teamed up with the Royal Collection Trust and King\u2019s College London, and reached across the Atlantic for help in bringing royal words to life. The Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture at the College of William & Mary serves as the primary U.S. partner for the project, and has sponsored several research fellows to study the archive. (You can apply here.) In addition, Mount Vernon, the Sons of the American Revolution, and the Library of Congress have all announced their participation. In 2015, the first wave of the program\u2019s researchers began to explore the manuscripts in earnest. Scholar Rick Atkinson, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner writing a new military history of the Revolution, recalls that \u201ca bit of magic\u201d clung to his daily commute up to Windsor Castle. He passed through the Henry VIII Gate and the Norman Gate, climbed 102 stone steps, and then ascended another 21 wooden steps in order to reach his desk in the iconic Round Tower. \u201cAnd there are the papers,\u201d says Atkinson. \u201cGeorge didn\u2019t have a secretary until his eyesight began to fail later in life. He wrote most everything himself. So it\u2019s not only a visual and a visceral experience, but a tactile one, because the papers have been beautifully preserved. Your fingers really do have a sense of walking back through history 240-some years.\u201d History, however, has not always been kind to George III. His loss of the American colonies, an extended conflict with Napoleon and painful episodes of mania (possibly caused by porphyria) all plagued his reign. But though biographers have painted him as authoritarian or erratic, scholars say that his private papers tell a different tale that humanizes the misunderstood monarch. While many colonists deplored the king as a despot bent on tyranny, his daily regimen\u2014diligently recorded in his papers\u2014was fairly routine. Family life and public duty marked out his days. He did much of his work in the morning, then headed over to St. James\u2019s Palace for diplomatic meetups. He enjoyed visiting Spithead to see the ships. He drew long regimental lists, sizing up the Revolutionary War\u2019s movements in painstaking detail. Within the same royal walls, George\u2019s wife, the German-born Queen Charlotte, labored through six hours of English lessons a day. She taught her daughters world geography, and operated a printing press at Frogmore. The story of how the royals lived during the Revolution\u2014and how Britain would fare beyond it\u2014lies in their private papers at Windsor Castle. Jim Ambuske, a post-doctoral fellow in digital humanities at the University of Virginia School of Law Library, was among the first scholars to tackle the archive shortly after the program\u2019s launch. Tuning into George III\u2019s political thought, Ambuske was struck by the king\u2019s clear, forceful prose and a viewpoint far from a traditional tyrant. \u201cComing out of the perspective of studying the Revolution, you have a sense of the George whose statues are pulled down in New York and whose proclamations are read. I guess I thought of him as a political figure, never as someone you might relate to on more than a regal level,\u201d Ambuske says. Reading the king\u2019s lengthy letters to his sons marked a turning point in his research. \u201cHe was also a guy who was capable of a great deal of empathy. He was very concerned, as any parent would be, about the well-being of his children and their education,\u201d says Ambuske. \u201cHe was well aware that he was raising potential future sovereigns, but he also wanted them to be good people.\u201d As Atkinson traced how the American Revolution\u2019s battles played out, he began to see George III as a man who was both \u201cvery much a domestic fellow,\u201d and a ruler who was \u201cthe driving force behind the hard line that the British had taken\u201d in the war. \u201cWhat comes across to me, looking at him via the papers,\u201d Atkinson says, \u201cis someone who is puzzling through an extraordinarily complex problem for which he does not really have a vocabulary.\u201d Long a shadowy figure in American history, George III and his world reemerge via his private papers. So, too, does a people\u2019s history of how the British experienced a transformative period in science, art, and culture. The archive's opening could mean a new era for scholars. Historians eager for evidence of George III\u2019s personal politics may find that court life also needs a new history. The busy lives of Queen Charlotte and her children call out for modern biographies. Royal art collectors merit a second look, too, as do the many servants who tended to George and Charlotte (and their 15 children) in royal style. This trove provides a dizzying array of ways to see the newly unveiled papers, from recreating royal dinners and tracing Scottish emigration to examining African authors in the Georgian court or comparing Washington\u2019s farming habits with those of his former king. \u201cThis is very likely the last great privately held archive that will illuminate the 18th-century Atlantic world,\u201d says historian Karin Wulf, director of the Omohundro Institute. \u201cSure, there is glorious material here to explore on King George III and the lost colonies, but there is also extraordinary material on transatlantic literary culture, on ideas about labor and agriculture, on politics of the highest and the most quotidian sort, of gender, family\u2026all manner of topics. It\u2019s not only the monarchs whose materials are preserved here. It\u2019s the people who worked for and with them, and it\u2019s the materials created by all kinds of people around the British Empire and beyond.\u201d In the United States, the Fourth of July is time to launch some fireworks and eat some hot dogs in celebration of American independence. But in 1776, when news reached Britain of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, the atmosphere was anything but celebratory. A look through letters from the period, now held in the archives of the U.K.\u2019s Nottingham University, shows that British people were divided about the outbreak of war with what was then their colony\u2014over how bad it was, whose fault it was and what to do about it. Before the Americans officially declared independence, the British were worried about what King George\u2019s response to the unrest there would be. After all, the Declaration of Independence was not the beginning of the American Revolution; the riot-provoking Stamp Act was passed in 1765, the Boston Tea Party took place in 1773 and the famous \u201cshot heard \u2019round the world\u201d that is seen as the start of the war was fired in 1775. One 1775 letter from a group of merchants and traders in the southwestern port city of Bristol sheds light on the economic concerns provoked by the burgeoning revolution. They wrote to the king to express their concern about the \u201cunhappily distracted empires\u201d and urged him to give the American colonists the freedoms they wanted rather than risk a precious trading relationship. \u201cIt is with an affliction not to be expressed and with the most anxious apprehensions for ourselves and our Posterity that we behold the growing distractions in America threaten, unless prevented by the timely interposition of your Majesty\u2019s Wisdom and Goodness, nothing less than a lasting and ruinous Civil War,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe are apprehensive that if the present measures are adhered to, a total alienation of the affections of our fellow subjects in the colonies will ensue, to which affection much more than to a dread of any power, we have been hitherto indebted for the inestimable benefits which we have derived from those establishments. We can foresee no good effects to the commerce or revenues of this kingdom at a future period from any victories which may be obtained by your majesty\u2019s army over desolated provinces and [\u2026] people.\u201d The traders warned the King that \u201cthe subsistence of a great part of your kingdom has depended very much on the Honourable and in this instance amicable behaviour of your American subjects. We have in this single city received no less than one million bushels of wheat [\u2026].\u201d While they were confident that \u201cnone can profit by the continuance of this war,\u201d the traders remained optimistic that the Americans would stay friendly if the British adopt a more conciliatory approach, despite things having been \u201ccarried to unfortunate lengths of hostility on both sides.\u201d \u201c[Our] fellow subjects in that part of the world are very far from having lost their affection and regard to their mother country or departed from the principles of commercial honour,\u201d they wrote. Though their optimism might seem misplaced today, at the time it wasn\u2019t completely ridiculous. After all, this was the same year that Americans\u2019 Second Continental Congress sent the crown the Olive Branch Petition, a last-ditch attempt to convince the King to back off so that the British subjects in the colonies could continue to live happily under his rule alongside their counterparts in England. Other letters, however, give indications that some people had given up hope that the King would give in to the colonists\u2019 requests. For example, in March of 1775, Chevalier Renaud Boccolari\u2014whose own homeland of France would see a massive anti-monarchical uprising just over a decade later\u2014wrote to peers from Modena, Italy, warning of the \u201cawful despotism [of the English king]\u201d and the \u201ccrowd of blind and ugly [people] with whom he has shared his unjust power for some time. \u201cWe still find among us souls who are sensitive to freedom, souls that have not been swallowed by the insulting dominion of priests, the barbarous constriction of the inquisition and the blind, despotic monarchy,\u201d he wrote. But, he felt \u201cevery free country should be alarmed\u201d that \u201cin this century everything is tending towards the most illegitimate despotism.\u201d When news finally broke that the Americans had, in fact, declared their independence\u2014that they planned on being their own country, no longer part of the British empire\u2014many in the English aristocracy were horrified. A series of letters received by the third Duke of Portland reveal how opinions differed on the subject. On July 22, 1776, his wife Dorothy wrote to him from Nottinghamshire that she had \u201creceived letters filled with unpleasant news, that from America I trust in God is not true, it really is too shocking.\u201d On Aug. 16 of that year, Baron Rudolph Bentick also wrote from the Netherlands, bemoaning the news and sharing what people in Europe thought. \u201cAs to people\u2019s opinion here of Great Britain\u2019s disputes with America,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe well meaning all agree no doubt that it is a most unhappy business for both countries and probably will prove a mortal blow to the liberties of the people of England.\u201d He warned that the influence of certain ambassadors might lead the Dutch to take advantage of Britain\u2019s loss, and \u201cprevent this country from acting a part most consistent and honourable to themselves, as well as beneficial to the liberties of Europe. Prudence prevents me from saying any more as this letter is to go by the post.\u201d Some, though, blamed the British government for what was happening, and willed their leaders to give up and abandon the war with the Americans. On Sept. 7, 1776, Stephen Sayre of Harley Street, London, wrote to the Duke of Portland urging him and others to come to a meeting to figure out how to cut Britain\u2019s losses. \u201cAnd tho we think America is lost: yet we wish to preserve this country,\u201d he wrote. And on Oct. 18 1776, the Rt. Honourable Thomas Townshend wrote to the Duke of Portland complaining that \u201cthe Government and Majority have drawn us into a war, that in our opinions is unjust in its Principle and ruinous in its consequences.\u201d As he prepared for a meeting of Parliament, of which he was a longstanding member, Townshend told the Duke the British authorities \u201cby their violence [\u2026] have driven the Americans to extremitys.\u201d \u201cI cannot for one, on any condition, give my assent to any of their measures in the prosecution of it,\u201d he wrote, worrying that many such measures would be proposed at Parliament\u2019s next session. He worried that, despite his point of view \u201cwe shall have a difficult task to support the Americans declaring for separation\u201d among the British political establishment. Townshend dismissed concerns about his letter being read by censors, writing \u201cI have no objection to any one knowing my opinion on this subject.\u201d Unsurprisingly, others were less sympathetic to the American rebels. On Dec. 30 1776, one G.B. Brudenell wrote from London, to H.F.C. Pelham-Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle under Lyne, giving news of the capture of Fort Washington by Gen. Howe, who drove the rebel forces from Manhattan, though at great cost. \u201cIt is very melancholy to think,\u201d Brudenell wrote, \u201cthat we must sacrifice so many brave lives, in order to put an end, to such an unnatural Rebellion.\u201d Britain was fighting five wars, including the American war, at the same time, the American independence was nothing but a distraction.
