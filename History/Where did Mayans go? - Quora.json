The Maya live and farm in highland Guatemala, lowland and highland Mexico, Honduras and Belize. There are approximately 2 to 5 million people who speak a Mayan language. They continue to practice an amalgamation of Catholicism and their own native religions that center on worshipping mountains and Crosses that are placed in the north, south, east, and west of each village and assigned colors based on saints/gods that delineate middle earth from that of the sky and the underworld. The Maya are actually a linguistic designation for about 35 separate languages related to each other but sometimes totally unintelligible. They have memories of their palaces and scribes and kings and queens as well as continue the divination as shown on stellae that dot their geography. Bottom line. They didn\u2019t go anywhere.

As for the clasic Maya civilization researchers still have not reached to a concensus about what happened. Some believe that there was a disease, while others believe that a drought caused famine and havoc in the classic age civilization. Hope I answered your question! ",
