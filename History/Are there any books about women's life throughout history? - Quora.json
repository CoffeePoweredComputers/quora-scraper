            "answer_text": "The First Sex by Elizabeth Gould Davis is considered part of the second wave of Feminism. In the book, Gould Davis aimed to show that early human society consisted of matriarchal \"queendoms\" based around worship of the \"Great Goddess\", and characterised by pacifism and democracy. Gould Davis argued that the early matriarchal societies attained a high level of civilization, which was largely wiped out as a result of the \"patriarchal revolution\". She asserted that patriarchy introduced a new system of society, based on property rights rather than human rights, and worshipping a stern and vengeful male deity instead of the caring and nurturing Mother Goddess. The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan is a an excellent description of the life of middle class women of 1950s in USA. Publisheed in1963 ,it is is widely credited with sparking the beginning of the second wave of Feminiism in the United States.In 1957, Friedan was asked to conduct a survey of her former Smith College classmates for their 15th anniversary reunion; the results, in which she found that many of them were unhappy with their lives as housewives, prompted her to begin research for The Feminine Mystique, conducting interviews with other suburban housewives, as well as researching psychology, media, and advertising. She originally intended to publish an article on the topic, not a book, but no magazine would publish her article. ",

            "answer_text": "Four Good Books About Women For You To Read! Women are soft, but they are also powerful. Women play many roles in their lives, as mother, as wife, as educators, as workers and as a wonderful creature. In this special day, we can sit in a caffee and enjoy these four books about women to know them and to share it to others. A Handmaid\u2019s Tale Author:Margaret Atwood  The Handmaid's Tale explores themes of women in subjugation in a patriarchal society and the various means by which these women attempt to gain individualism and independence. The novel's title echoes the component parts of Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales,which is a series of connected stories . The Handmaid's Tale is structured into two parts, night and other various events. This novel can be interpreted as a double narrative, Offred's tale and the handmaids' tales. The night sections are solely about Offred, and the other sections (shopping, waiting room, household, etc.) are the stories that describe the possible life of every handmaid, though from the perspective of Offred. In many of these sections, Offred jumps between past and present as she retells the events leading up to the fall of women's rights and the current details of the life which she now lives. Half The Sky Author:Nicolas D. Christopher; Sherry Dunn  \"This book takes the clue of figures' tories, with great amount of data; it not only restrains in the reports of women's encounters, but also demonstrates thought over society, economics, culture, psychology and etc. At the meantime, it provides practical reference to those who want to do their parts for the world. Shocking narrations, full and accurate records, all constitute the life forms mixing sadness and hope. Maybe you are living comfortably, but cannot be indifferent to hardness from another world which is not that far from us The Second Sex Author:Simone de Beauvoir  Newly translated and unabridged in English for the first time, Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s masterwork is a powerful analysis of the Western notion of \u201cwoman,\u201d and a groundbreaking exploration of inequality and otherness. This long-awaited new edition reinstates significant portions of the original French text that were cut in the first English translation. Vital and groundbreaking, Beauvoir\u2019s pioneering and impressive text remains as pertinent today as it was back then, and will continue to provoke and inspire generations of men and women to come. The Women\u2019s Room Author:Marilyn French  The bestselling feminist novel that awakened both women and men, The Women's Room follows the transformation of Mira Ward and her circle as the women's movement begins to have an impact on their lives. A biting social commentary on an emotional world gone silently haywire, The Women's Room is a modern classic that offers piercing insight into the social norms accepted so blindly and revered so completely. Marilyn French questions those accepted norms and poignantly portrays the hopeful believers looking for new truths. Still, there are thousands of great books in the world. But through these book I recommended we can probably understand the situation of the women in their lives and start to love them at our best. Again, happy Women\u2019s Day for all the goddness!\u2764\u2764\u2764 You can also see these books with the help of this tool. ",

After your best bet is to look at famous figures to know more about the condition of women : Blanche of Castille, Alienor of Aquitaine have had many biographers, or religious history - Hildegard of Bingen is a particularly interesting one.
