            "answer_text": "President Aguinaldo declared Pinas independence; a move that was, according to Mabini, an error because while we Pinoys made our aim known, the norte americanos hide theirs. A gentleman, el presidente believed the norte americanos were friends, while the losing Castillians surrendered to the norte americanos in Manila. For reasons of safety, Emilio moved his headquarters to Malolos, Kawit being within the range of the guns of warships in Sangley Point. Dewey et. al were friendly at first, while waiting for the arrival of the Volunteers from the States. When the US Marines came in, firing started and when it ended, Aguinaldo was a prisoner from Palanan, Mabini captured too in h Cuyapo and the first Pinipitpit republik lost it body and it\u2019s brains and is history. Achievements? Many but all organic in nature as favorable conditions were not created because of defeat. By decrees Aguinaldo created the academia militar, the Pinilipit Army (don\u2019t get mad at me, it was my grampa\u2019s, no chance fighting the norte americanos frontally, you will be blown, have superior arms, those Kanos). A Congress was held in Malolos, the Balete tree was still there in the 1980s, maybe still there now in the Baras ng mga Suwail church. By leading the republik and having his congress and army, even defeated, Aguinaldo sent the message to the Pinoys from Luzon to the Visayas and in Mindanao that there is such an entity called Filipinas, got a flag, and an army, a few lawyers and have bloodied some Companies of the norte americanos and even beheaded Gen. Lawton in combat. Not a bad achievement for the sons of indios, right? Aguinaldo and most Insurgents (US term) who surrendered were paroled and most went back to civilian life. Paciano, Dr. Jose Rizal\u2019s bro, went back to farming. However, Mabini did not signed the Oath and was exiled to the Marianas, racked by tuberculosis, he was returned to Pinas to die in Nagtahan. No gun salutes for the vanquished, only muted tears. ",

            "answer_text": "Emilio Aguinaldo is a real statesman. Though his name, has full of controversy and issues. Some of his accomplishment are the establishment of Malolos Congress, 1897 Declaration of Independence, and just being the first President of the Philippines is a unifying factor during that time. Not much of policy achievements but his presence was symbolic during that time. ",
