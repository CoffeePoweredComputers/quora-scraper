            "answer_text": "Kaaba building location at Mecca is an issue of faith based not on Islamic, scriptures but assumed as preached by Muhammad pbuh. It is a difficult issue that can hardly be authenticated by any other thing than believe in Muhammad pbuh narratives. Nomenclature- Mecca is never mentioned in Qur'an in relationship to Abraham or Ishmael. The nearest legendary story related to Mecca is the story of Infant Ishmael and his mother been sent away from home by Abraham whereby an angel met them and Zamzam water was given to alleviate their problems, that is the location of zamzam spring. I say legendary because neither Qur'an nor Bible talked about infant Ishmael been sent away from home. In Qur'an V 37 : 100\u2013105, Ishmael lived with Abraham till he was aged to discuss with Abraham about his dream to sacrifice him, the remembrance of which is being done till today. In the Bible he lived with Abraham till Isaac was born by Sarah, by that time he Ishmael was above 14 years of age. Therefore the story of zamzam in Mecca given to Ishmael and his mother can not be authenticated by any scripture Torah, gospel or Qur'an. The other place Mecca can be associated is building of the Kaaba by Abraham and Ishmael, the issue here is Mecca as it is presently known or Bakkah as the area previously known was not mentioned in Qur'an in relation to either Abraham or Ishmael. If we agree that Abraham and Ishmael built a place of worship V 2:126\u2013129 somewhere, is it possible to be in a place where Ishmael and his mother were rescued from the fang of death by an angel after been sent out by Abraham and they had exhausted their provisions? How do we relate the events of Ishmael who grew up with his father in both Bible and Qur'an with a legendary story of infant Ishmael been sent away from home an a spring of zamzam in Mecca. How did Abraham found a place where his infant boy and the mother who never left home was helped by Angel. If Ishmael left home as an infant it invalidates revealed V 37:100\u2013105+ Was this legendary location where the infant was assisted the place he lived till Abraham found him and they built the Kaaba? As you said Islamic believe, but the location is hardly backed up by any scripture of Abraham faith. Kaaba or a place of worship was built by Abraham and Ishmael by believe of believers but location is not backed up by scriptures. ",
