            "answer_text": "What is Corporate Culture? Corporate culture is basically the way things work in a company, how the processes are built there. Among others, it is something we take into account when deciding whether the work in a particular company would be comfortable for us personally. But in a more formal definition, corporate culture is seen as a system of generally accepted goals, values, beliefs, rules, and norms of behavior that the employees of an organization share. It\u2019s what encourages people to follow patterns of behavior that support the achievement of organizational goals. And if you try to analyze why world-famous companies have become successful, you will notice they had an inspiring, future-oriented goal. Microsoft would be a great example here. Its initial goal was \u201cA computer on every desk and in every home\u201d. Now that they have achieved that, their goal evolved, and now it is \u201cto empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more\u201d. This goal has built Microsoft corporate culture that refers to the values, traditions and behavioral expectations among employees. But to make people work toward these goals, the company has to have a set of values. And that is the main element that is in the center of any corporate culture. Corporate Culture Key Elements Values These are the basic principles and ideas adopted by the organization. They form the core of corporate culture and determine the direction of workers\u2019 activities, ensuring success. Organizations with a strong culture have rich and complex value systems accepted by all employees. Here are a couple of examples of great sets of values: Airbnb defines its values as: Champion The Mission \u2013 Prioritise work that advances the mission and positively impacts the community. Build with the long-term in mind. Actively participate in the community and cultureBe A Host \u2013 Care for others and make them feel like they belong. Encourage others to participate to their fullest. Listen, communicate openly and set clear expectationsEmbrace The Adventure \u2013 Be curious, ask for help, and demonstrate an ability to grow. Own and learn from mistakes. Bring joy and optimism to workBe A Cereal Entrepreneur \u2013 an actual term, not a typo \u2013 Be bold and apply original thinking. Imagine the ideal outcomeCoca Cola defines its values somewhat broader, as: Leadership: The courage to shape a better futureCollaboration: Leverage collective geniusIntegrity: Be realAccountability: If it is to be, it\u2019s up to mePassion: Committed in heart and mindDiversity: As inclusive as our brandsQuality: What we do, we do wellPeople It is impossible to build a solid corporate culture without people. Employees embody the values of the company and directly influence the corporate culture. That is why most companies find it crucial to hire people who already share and understand the same values the company maintains. For instance, Ante Technologies claims: \u201cYou know you have become part of Ante Technologies when you see your contribution to our results and projects together with your own personal career development starts to soar\u201d However, some companies focus on their customers first, when the employees are second in priority. It depends on other values and mission of the organization. However, Virgin CEO Richard Branson believes that making employees a top priority, the company benefits both customers and investors. Experiences These include all the events and practices that occur in the daily life of an organization. Organizations with a strong culture pay great attention to it since it reflects the uniqueness of the culture of each organization and the characteristics of internal management. Management System & Communication This is a so-called chain of command in the organization: titles, positions, and roles performed by employees. It can be vertical or horizontal. Vertical structure is where each employee receives orders from a manager of a higher rank. The chain of command goes from top to bottom only. Contrary to vertical, horizontal structure connects all the employees. The work is performed in teams where each member has a specific role. Narrative Every organization has a history \u2014 a unique story of its foundation and development. And an exciting narrative built out of it can be a great addition to any company culture. It can be something like the story about Steve Jobs\u2019 interest in calligraphy that came in handy when designing Macintosh. But it does not have to be just that. For example, Coca-Cola has a World of Coke museum that represents its products and how they have changed throughout the years.  And The New York Times has a digital archive of its newspapers starting from 1851. The subscribers can even find the first article about the Moon landing in a fully searchable archive of past newspapers.  Environment Place shapes culture. And certain office activities require different spaces. For instance, open space is great for collaboration, but others might find it crowdy and uncomfortable. That is why more and more companies are beyond concerned about their offices, trying to make them the best environment possible. But place is not only the office. It\u2019s the location too. Geography has a significant influence on corporate culture. That is why we will define the main features of corporate culture in different parts of the world to see how they differ based on geography. ",

            "answer_text": "Customer-focused culture. A customer-focused culture seeks to excel at providing customer benefits at a low price. Such cultures seek to attract and motivate employees with a passion for developing innovative products, delivering service that makes customers keep buying from the company; and a willingness to work with other departments in the company to get and keep customers. Performance-driven culture. A performance-oriented culture sets specific goals for everyone and expects people to exceed their performance targets consistently. Such a culture tends to focus on measuring what the CEO believes matters most to startup investors--which is revenue growth. People who meet the CEO's ambitious quarterly performance targets are rewarded and those who do not are quickly fired. Employee-focused culture. An employee-focused culture places primary emphasis on the development of employees' abilities. It hires people with entrepreneurial potential, encourages them to develop their skills and take on greater responsibilities. The risk of an employee-focused culture is that the company develops the skills of its employees and rivals hire them away. No articulated culture. In such companies, the CEO has outstanding technical skills but less impressive leadership abilities. If such a CEO can lead a technical team that builds a product that sells itself, the company may not need to articulate a culture. But such companies generally do not scale. ",
