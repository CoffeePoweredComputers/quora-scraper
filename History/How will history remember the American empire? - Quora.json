            "answer_text": "::How will history remember the American empire?:: The American Empire, or rather, the American World Hegemony, probably will be remembered just as its predecessor, the British Empire, is remembered today: as a vehicle for the political agenda of whoever is expressing an opinion about it. An Empire that trumpeted the values of individualism and unfettered private enterprise over the oppressive power of the State, but in reality was a corporatocratic Empire \u2018built from the bones of the dead, with mud and straw, blood and sweat,\u2019 with its own tropical Gulag in Guant\u00e1namo, in the name of those very same hypocritical values. A liberal Colossus that fought for Freedom & Democracy in WWII, and fought for decades against another Empire, an evil one, for Liberty and Democracy, and after vanquishing the Evil Empire, fought to maintain global order and promote worldwide prosperity. That\u2019s the problem with empires: they are so complex and provoke such emotive responses, that to reach a consensus is impossible. ",
