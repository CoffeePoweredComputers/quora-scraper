            "answer_text": "Differently from Sheri Tanner's answer to Are there 100% full-blooded Mayans still alive today?, on my opinion there\u2019s no 100% full-blooded Mayans, or Italians, or English people, etc. In the temporal lapse of 500+ years there\u2019s many generations and with exponential growth of international interaction, immigration and wars it\u2019ll be extremaly rare to find a people that hasn\u2019t interact with other kinds, although they do exist, Mayans just are not one of them. They could\u2019ve preserved most (not total, evidently) cultural values, but aren\u2019t, as you said, full-blooded. You see, even before Spanish arrived there, they already had contact with Aztecs, Olmecs, Zapotecas, etc. E.g. around the city of Xicalango, and these people have some genetic differences, like height for example.

            "answer_text": "Yes. I had the pleasure of meeting many full-blooded Mayans while I was in Mexico a few years ago. They are very proud of their heritage (as they should be) and were eager to educate me on the significance of their culture. Mayan people have a very beautiful, distinct look that is quite recognizable in comparison to their Mexican countrymen. One Mayan tour guide, that I spoke with, did mention that there are no more Inca in the modern world. But that might have been anecdotal information. ",
