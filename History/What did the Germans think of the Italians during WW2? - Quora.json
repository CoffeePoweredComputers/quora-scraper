            "answer_text": "We were an ally who was worse than an enemy and the Germans rightly remarked it. Like many other Italians I think that Mussolini was a British agent who dragged Italy into that war with the purpose of causing trouble to the Germans. Mussolini was the only one who wanted Italy to take part in WWII against the opinion of all government. Mussolini waged war against Greece dragging the Germans in a war against Yugoslavia that absorbed important Wehrmacht resources badly needed otherwhere. Mussolini blocked the development of Italian heavy tanks (FIAT 2000): only 12 tons tanks were allowed in a war of 30 tons tanks or heavier (see Mussolini\u2019s biography by Luigi BARZINI junior). Heavy tanks were a weapon of vital importance for a country like Italy poor of raw materials and fuels and confronted by hordes of enemy tanks. Mussolini decided (against the opinion of all photographic experts) that British battleships \u201cValiant\u201d and \u201cQueen Elizabeth\u201d were not sunk by Italian frogmen in the port of Alexandria as they were: he forbade our fleet from supplying Rommel who became a lamed duck at EL Alamein. According to documents published by \u201cThe Guardian\u201d and well before \u201cThe Guardian\u201d by the Italian newspaper \u201cIl Borghese\u201d in the sixties, Mussolini was paid by the \u201cEntente secret services\u201d to found his newspaper \u201cIl Popolo d\u2019Italia\u201d and use it to drag Italy into WWI on the side of France and Britain. He was on the payroll of MI5. According to recent \u201cdiscoveries\u201d made in Italy Mussolini was killed by British officer Robert MACCARONE to prevent him from speaking. Still a mystery is why the Allied didn\u2019t jail Mussolini after Italy\u2019s surrender and never prosecuted the war criminals they put at his place: a mystery that could be explained by the fact that also BADOGLIO, CAVIGLIA and company worked in reality for the British as some documents seem to proof. As a conclusion the Germans were right to see Italy as a bunch of traitors and only the Madman who led them could see us as an ally. ",

            "answer_text": "There general opinion of them wasn't good, they thought they were lazy and definitely unreliable, that's being nice. They definitely were not a side that gave there all. But over the years I have learner that some Italian division fought like mofos, it's mainly that they didn't want to be in a war in the first place, especially against the Allies where they were getting their ass kicked, in their defence they had crap weapons compared to Germans and alot of times they just crumble and give up . Hitler had to spend time worrying about them and that pissed the Germans off, look the general opinion was not good the reason why is something that people have different idea's about, some Germans probably liked them . If I was given shit equipment and stuck in the desert or freezing snow I wouldn't want to fight either, also alot of Italian people did not have the same ideological views as Germans or Mussolini, I hope that helps mate.
