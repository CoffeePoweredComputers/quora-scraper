            "answer_text": "Time is an historical phenomenon, a mentality, and a way of apprehending a changing world. It is the understanding of historical time, where time becomes concrete in the form of narratives and artifacts, which gives coherence to the individual events from the past. Understanding chronology is basic to visualizing the past and to making comparisons between historical eras and the present with regard to change and continuity. The widening gap between past and present often results in a new sensibility of time. Thinking about history and thinking historically are quite different things. Although most people think of history\u2014and learn it\u2014as a conglomeration of facts, dates, and key figures, for professional historians historical thinking is a way of knowing, a method for developing and understanding the relationships of peoples and events in the past. German historian of the late 19th century, Wilhelm Dilthey wrote, \u201cWe are historical beings first, before we are observers of history, and only because we are the former do we become the latter.\u201d Dilthey's research interests revolved around questions of scientific methodology, historical evidence, and history's status as a science. He understood that the process of interpretive inquiry is not described in terms of an object or event of the past, but as a series of worldviews. [i] Academic scholarship seems particularly unable to depart from \u201cpresent-mindedness\u201d in writing histories filled with negative stereotypes relevant to contemporary paradigms and passing fancies of correctness. It is a bit unfair to hold persons from the past to modern standards of behavior and appropriate patterns of thought. The spans of time in human history are so vast when compared to the span of a lifetime and of recent history that it\u2019s almost impossible to get a handle on it.

In fact the biggest losers seem to have the biggest audience, a disease of the present, history will look back and laugh at all of that. Not many other disciplines can teach a geopolitical grounding like history and apply it to the going ons today. Everything is linked or a cycle in a passage of time, girls will wear doc martins now, but in 10/15 years when they\u2019re seen as the attire of skinheads and racists, the girls will turn to moon boots and reebok classics. Shitty modern culture repeats itself more than we like to admit, ",

            "answer_text": "Studying history is important because it allows us to understand our past, which in turn allows us to understand our present. If we want to know how and why our world is the way it is today, we have to look to history for answers. People often say that \u201chistory repeats itself,\u201d but if we study the successes and failures of the past, we may, ideally, be able to learn from our mistakes and avoid repeating them in the future. Studying history can provide us with insight into our cultures of origin as well as cultures with which we might be less familiar, thereby increasing cross-cultural awareness and understanding. ",

            "answer_text": "History is the reason of why we are here. It teaches a lot of things such as lessons, and stories. Teaching someone else history is like teaching lessons as well. For instance, if I were to tell you about the Industrial Revolution, then it would also be like telling you that demand is met with service and innovation. If this was the case with Hammurabi and the \u00a8eye for an eye\u00a8 law, the lesson would be that the law is enforced by someone powerful. Also, in history is where our ancestors are, and it was them that we are still here. They were here before, and now we are. ",
