            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a non-Zionist religious Jew. It doesn\u2019t matter to me why you\u2019re anti-Israel, you may even have legitimate concerns with the way Israel behaves, but by publicly expressing anti-Israel feelings you put Jewish people in harm's way. By seeking to weaken the state of Israel you wish to put the millions of Jews who live there in danger. Jews worldwide are associated with Israel & by even verbally supporting those who hate Israel you are emboldening them to target any Jew with violence. Jews in Paris & all over Europe have nothing to do with Palestinian hardship but they are being targeted by Muslim hatred in the name of Palestine. Hamas & the PLO thrive on the goodwill shown to them by liberal leftists who honestly believe in the Palestinian cause. If a political non-violent solution would be possible I would be fine with it, human life takes precedence of Jewish sovereignty of the Holyland. The problem is that their marches & BDS fuels the justification of terrorists to indiscriminately attack all Jews anywhere, anytime. The hands of these anti-Israel / Pro Palestinians are soaked with the blood of innocent Jews who have nothing to do with the political conflict in the Middle East. Many leftist \u201cpro-peace\u201d Jews are also indirectly responsible for the deaths of their fellow Jews because they offer moral support to people who justify the murder of innocent Jews. They may not have antisemitic intentions but the net result is that they put all Jews in harm's way. ",
