            "answer_text": "First, the internal organs were removed and preserved in canopic jars. Next, the body was packed in a mineral salt called Sodium Decahydrate (Natron) for up to three months. This dessicated the corpse, which prevents decomposition. Next, the body was washed with various perfumes and oils to remove the salt residue. After that, the body was carefully wrapped in linen bandages. In between layers of linen, the embalmer would hide various charms and amulets designed to ward off misfortune. Once the body was wrapped, funerary priests would recite the \u201cBook of the Dead\u201d over the corpse. The corpse was then placed in a series of coffins like a Russian nesting doll. Each coffin was more elaborate than the one before it. This entire process was very successful. Even today, there are mummies in such good condition that they can undergo medical scans. ",

Here it would be \u2018purified\u2019 using water and palm oil, representing the deceased\u2019s rebirth and helping to keep them smelling sweet for longer. Then the body was taken to the \u2018pernefer\u2019, another tent where the embalmment would take place. Only priests were qualified to carry out this procedure, with the chief embalmer known as the \u2018hery seshta\u2019. This man represented Anubis, the god of embalming and the dead, and often wore a jackal mask to show his importance. The hery seshta was responsible for wrapping the body and performing religious rites over the deceased \u2013 an element of the embalmment process just as vital as the physical preservation of the body.
