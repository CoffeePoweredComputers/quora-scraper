            "answer_text": "The original \"ricer\" (potato ricer) is/was a kitchen appliance to mash potatoes by forcing the stuff through small holes. The new meaning of \"ricer\" (basically from around 10 or 15 years ago) is an automobile fanatic who makes unnecessary modifications to their import-brand Asian car (nicknamed \"rice\") to make it seem faster for flashier. The usual but pointless modifications are (a) a huge exhaust system that serves nothing but to make the damned car louder, or (b) a large spoiler that looks like a Boeing 747 tailfin. Since then, I've read some online articles that \"ricer\" now has an even newer meaning of to suck at everything you attempt. The first two meanings are pretty established already, so the third one is discountable. For now. ",
