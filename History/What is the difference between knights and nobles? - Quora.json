            "answer_text": "Nobles were the upper ranks of society, usually having at least traces of royal blood. A noble who became a soldier would become a knight. Peasants who became soldiers were called men at arms. They could even serve the same purpose, have the same equipment and even the same wealth but a knight would socially outrank a man at arms. Rarely a soldier who served with distinction would be knighted, allowing him and his family to join the nobility. ",
