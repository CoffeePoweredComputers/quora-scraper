            "answer_text": "Originally, instead money, goods were traded, shells, crafts, things people needed (food and basic living ingredients such as flour, water, meat, fruit). If you think of it money is a much more consistent form to trade with as it can be stored, transferred and transformed easily into other goods and commodities. One of the clear advantages of paper money is that carrying a similar amount of money in coins would be extremely cumbersome, so this allows that larger number to be rationalised into a single transportable unit, until a note is broken into change.

            "answer_text": "Earlier the coins are made up of metals say gold or silver . Using coins for an exchange becomes difficult .Comparatively, paper currency is easier to store than coins as it requires less space. There are a greater number of coins available in the world due to their long existence throughout history. Paper currency tends to be more expensive to purchase due to higher face values. This enhace our currency value nd also helps to preserve those precious metals. ",
