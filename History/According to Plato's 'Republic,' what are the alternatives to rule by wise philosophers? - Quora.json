            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not so much about alternative regimes, but a line of progressive degeneration. According to Plato\u2019s The Republic, there are five regimes: the ideal one, which we can call \u201caristocracy of the mind,\u201d and four flawed ones. Each regime degenerates into the next as a result of some socio-political turmoil and/or mistake in the way public affairs are run. Aristocracy of the mind Social balance and justice are served, because the people are divided in three classes according to their natural proclivities and the education they\u2019ve received. The philosopher kings, who correspond to reason, are the selfless rulers; the guardians, who represent emotions, make up the military and law enforcement bodies; and the producers, who are inclined to follow their appetites and instincts, are the workforce of the republic. Timocracy A slightly flawed regime, timocracy appears when people are allowed to participate in social classes they don\u2019t belong to by nature. In such a polity, the rulers are allowed to look after their own interests and pursue a militaristic and wealth- and honor-amassing way of life. In short, the common affairs are governed not by pure reason, but by emotions. The closest historical example of timocracy, according to Plato, was classical Sparta. Oligarchy Oligarchy \u201crule by the few\u201d is even worse and emerges when a critical mass of people living under a timocracy surrender themselves to a materialistic and corrupt way of thinking. Thus, public offices are gradually saved only for the rich, which trumps meritocracy, education and honors. The poor are marginalized, with some even turning to criminal activities. The polity is destabilized and performs poorly in many respects. Democracy When the property-less mob reach a point of no return, they revolt against the oligarchs, topple them and introduce an even worse regime, democracy \u201crule by the people / mob.\u201d Sortition becomes the main electoral system, so that everyone may have equal chances of holding a public office regardless of their wealth and virtue. Hierarchy is abolished, people act recklessly, laws are not respected, and the young disobey their teachers and elders. Tyranny Democracy leads to anarchy and exacerbates social tension. The poor mob gather around a strongman, who promises to protect them. After he seizes power and installs himself as tyrant, he breaks his commitments, cracks down on the best citizens, wages wars to distract attention and pursues every kind of depraved pleasure for himself; it\u2019s the worst regime. When the people try to topple him, they fail, because he already controls the state. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s take this simple and get the basics cleared up. In the Republic, Plato argues that the structure of a \u201ccity\u201d is a reflection of the structure of the soul (and vice versa). He argues there are three \u201cparts\u201d to the soul: the reason (or understanding), the \u201cspirit\u201d (or will), and the appetites (or, desires). These parts can be arranged differently and define different types of individuals (and by extension, different types of city). Reason is the highest part of the soul. The spirit or will is the middle part. And the appetites or desires are the lowest (or most basic) part. We share the lowest part with animals \u2014 animals and humans all have appetites or desires (or, to use Freud\u2019s language, drives or instincts). In the individual, each of these parts can either \u201crule\u201d or be ruled. For example, in a person governed by their desires, both their reason and their will is governed (or enslaved, in Plato\u2019s view) by their appetites and desires. Or, one can be governed by one\u2019s will: such a person is \u201cwillful,\u201d proud-minded, and so forth. Plato argues in a well-ordered soul, reason governs the will, and then the spirit or will, guided by reason, controls the appetites. And so it also goes in the larger version of this structure in the form of the city (or society). A society can be governed by desires, will, or reason. Ideally, the city would be governed by the wise (the rational), with the willful element (the guardians or warriors) obeying the laws established by the rational class, and the appetitive element (the class interested in pleasure, wealth, etc.) obeying the law-abiding and rationally-ruled guardians and warriors. So there is your answer in basic. A society can be governed by reason (the wise), by the willful, or by mere animal desires. A society governed by desires will be a society dominated by the pursuit of wealth and pleasure; a society governed by the willful will be dominated by the pursuit of order, authority, military honor and conquest, and so forth; but only a society governed by reason will keep both the will and the appetites under control and in the proper harmony. Plato calls this last form of society the only one which is truly \u201cjust.\u201d In a society governed by willful people, they may *wish* they knew what was just but do not know what it is; in a society governed by appetites, well, people just want pleasure and riches. I leave it to you to ask yourself what type of society you live in today. Here in the US, we currently seem to be stuck at the lowest level, with a person governed by animal desires as our leader, and who thinks anything else is foolish. But Plato would beg to differ, as I think you can see. He would say, the US is a very wretched and embarrassing society, currently. ",
