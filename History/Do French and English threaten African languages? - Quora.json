            "answer_text": "In my view, the threat is not so much from migrants; there aren\u2019t that many to African countries; but our own children are losing their ancestral languages, because even within the countries, these languages are not used for work. There are many ethnic groups within each country, thanks to colonization and the way Africa was chopped up: these groups use English, French, Portuguese or Spanish to communicate with each other (in some cases Pidgin English). And then there is the diaspora: if children of Africans are raised abroad, especially if the parents don\u2019t share an African language, the ancestral language is lost. ",

However, basically regional lingua francas - big languages used for intertribal and interethnic communications - are the most important threat, and of these at least Sango and Swahili are purely African languages. Also, in Angola and Mozambique, Portuguese is the big threat, because in those countries it is the colonial language still used officially, and at least in Angola it is common enough that people of purely African ancestry speak Portuguese natively.
