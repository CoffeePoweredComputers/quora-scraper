            "answer_text": " What kind of underwear did medieval people have? Medieval folks wore what was comfortable when they could, and posh when they could afford it. Wool, linen, leather, velvet, and silk were the materials used with silk being the most comfortable and most expensive. I have had silk blouses but not silk underwear. I remember Jackie Kennedy when criticized for spending too much money on clothes made a comment to the effect that she would have to be wearing fur underwear. Wool is cheaper and but woolen undies can be scratchy. Braies began as outerwear and in the late medieval period transitioned to underwear. The man on the above right displays the drawstring at the waist, his braies or breeches reach below the knee and are loose enough for freedom while working. The \u201cslit\u201d or open area behind the knee makes squatting easier.  Before braies, men tucked themselves in a Loincloth.  These would be fine in the summer, but a mite chilly in winter. YouTube has several videos demonstrating how to make one. I did find information on how to tie one on. It is about 2 minutes. \u2b07\ufe0f Royalty and the nobility wore Hose. These were popular among younger men   while their elders began to adopt them also, Soon, the hose, or hosen, became a bit fancier. Particoloured and other variations came into fashion. Some had leather soles negating the need for shoes. Sometimes the hose were two separate pieces; others were more like spandex pants. Men probably didn\u2019t worry about keeping them seams straight as women did in later centuries.  As the decades passed, the tunics went up and down the body, much as dresses have done for women. When they ended at the waistline, men decided to emphasis their natural assets. They did so by adopting the Codpiece. When I think of codpieces \u2014which I seldom do \u2014 I think first of a man who had to be uncertain of his manliness. But that is the Tudor period. This gentleman wants to be certain his assets are noticed, so he had his portrait painted with an obviously pointing finger.  Sometimes pointing wasn\u2019t necessary.  Of course, when men were dressed like this \u2b07\ufe0f, he could have gone commando.  The medieval fashions covered a thousand years and many countries. I am sure I have omitted some detail you feel should be included. Please add it in a comment and I will upvote it so it is \u201crecommended\u201d and can be seen by other readers. Women deserve their own answers. I have included a video below as eye-candy for anyone who is interested.  Pinterest images  Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis  ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing that unusual. It\u2019s not my area of study, so you\u2019re going to get a half-hearted answer. Long underwear used to be popular for the winter, and was generally kept on through the whole winter. Material was typically wool or linen, silk if you were rich. Underwear used to be laced to your other clothes so as to keep it up, as they didn\u2019t have elastic to hold it on. Bras seem to exist as far back as Roman times at least, and have probably been around basically forever. They are of course simple constructions compared to modern ones, but the design is still pretty similar. Of course, many people through history did not wear underwear. ",
