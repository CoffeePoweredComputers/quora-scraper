            "answer_text": "This question is part of a large historical debate among historians of Russia called the \u201cNormanist Controversy\u201d, AKA the \u201cNorman Problem\u201d or \u201cVarangian problem\u201d. Wikipedia has a good summary of the Normanist Controversy. But this article has much more detail. A google search for any of the above terms will yield a variety of results. Many Russians with nationalistic sentiments jump to the erroneous conclusion that, if the ruling class of the Rus were composed of Scandinavians, it must entail that the average Russian is of Scandinavian stock. So they simply reject the Normanist theory as German revisionist history. The Kievan Primary Chronicle (c. 1070-1118) has always been a major cornerstone of the history of East Slavs. Doubt about the reliability of this source seems to be well founded. The text was compiled by anonymous monks, with questionable/absent historical methods, centuries removed from the events.P.M. Barford (author of The Early Slavs, published by Cornell University Press 2001) believes that it\u2019s rife with legendary fiction and interpolations, \u201ccommon of such writings in the early Middle Ages\u201d.Corroborating texts such as Byzantine histories of Rus\u2019 attacks on Constantinople supposedly offer dates that conflict with the PVL.Both Barford and Dimitri Obolensky (author of Byzantium and the Slavs, published by St Vladimir\u2019s Seminary Press 1994) conclude that the legend of Rurik may very well be mostly or entirely mythical. \u201cThe annalist was attempting to create the history of a unified state with a single dynasty of rulers ruling in an unbroken father-to-son line of descent with no other claimants, in other words the ideal paradigm of a state\u201d (The Early Slavs, p. 233).The seemingly legendary account that Rurik was invited in by the peoples of the north has a strong resemblance to the people of Israel requesting someone to rule over and judge them as reported in the Book of Samuel.Another piece of evidence in favor of the Normanist position is the account of the Bertinian Annals, which tell of emissaries from the \u201cRhos\u201d who arrived at the court of Emperor Louis the Pious in Ingelheim in 839 from Byzantium, who were thought by Louis to be Swedes. Other evidence in favor of the Normanist position are treaties of 912 and 944 drawn up between the \u2018Rus\u2019 and Byzantium which are preserved in the PVL (presumably copied in the 1090s from the Byzantine archives), listing Rus\u2019 warriors whose names are of Scandinavian origin. Barford states that \u201cboth the archeological and the written sources can support various interpretations\u201d. But on the following page he mentions that there is archaeological evidence for the presence of Scandinavians in several parts of East Slav territory. I suppose this may not weigh in favor of Normanism, but it is good background knowledge for assigning a prior probability. The caveat Barford mentions is that \u201cthe mere presence of an object made in Scandinavia or of a style used in Scandinavia does not mean that the last person who used it before it was deposited in the ground was a Scandinavian.\u201d But a number of Scandinavian graves excavated in and around Russia attest to fairly widespread Scandinavian immigration among the East Slavs, with \u201cextensive Scandinavian penetration of parts of the forest zone in the northern part of the Kievan state\u201d. So the Scandinavian presence is well founded. But according to Barford \u201cwhether they actually played the role in the 9th century as the PVL suggests is far more debatable.\u201d There is a \u201cRurikhid Dynasty DNA Project\u201d on Family Tree DNA that evinces results that would seem to support the Normanist theory. This is based on several triangulating results of reported descendants of Rurik belonging to the Y-DNA haplogroup N1c1. But I\u2019m not sure if this project is being handled competently or if the people being tested can be proven empirically to be descendants of anyone from the Rurikhid Dynasty. ",

            "answer_text": "Not really. The story of Russians is one of hype, myths, and downright falsifications. A lot of people contributed to the story. The main players who spun the tale were (1) the House of Romanovs who ruled Russia for 300 years; (2) enemies of the House of Romanovs; and (3) a lot of enthusiasts who wanted to contribute to the Russian nation-building. Below is my personal DNA composition. I have close to zero blue blood: there is no known gentry in my ancestry. My family name stems from some nondescript village in western Russia. I was told no family story of someone fishing one of my forefathers as a baby from the basket drifting down the river from the old royal castle. I\u2019m your eternal commoner.  My DNA tells you the true story of Russians. It goes like this. Colonization hubs It all started with the Varangians (i.e. Scandinavians) building logistical fortifications along the fluvial routes from the Baltics down to the Caspian and Black Sea. These were the people known as Rus. They left their footprint alright, but they weren\u2019t many. Almost all of them were men. These men had babies with local girls, and their sons had babies with local girls, too. (Dima Vorobiev's answer to If the Vikings were so strong, why were they annihilated so quickly?) After a few iterations, when the Mongols arrived in the 13th century, the Scandinavian ancestry in our lands had already been diluted to insignificance. Empire of Jochi Everyone heard about the shock and awe of the Mongol invasion. Everyone was told they wrecked everything in their path, including the old Rus. What fewer people know is that there is no forensics proving their physical presence in the Russian heartland. Despite what the old chronicles tell us, it\u2019s much more likely that the Mongols simply outsourced the conquest of Rus to our own collaborators. St. Alexander Nevsky and the likes of him were only too happy to oblige. Therefore, you see no Mongol or Turkic traces in my DNA. This is true for many other Russians. Ugro-Finns Modern Russia has grown big and mighty out of Muscovy, a poor wooded frontier of the Empire of Jochi. This was a breakout civilization founded by the descendants of the Varangians from Kiev and Novgorod. They harvested these areas for slaves, honey, pelts, wax, and other colonial wares starting from the 9th century. Originally, this was an endless wilderness populated by scattered families of Ugro-Finns. Hence, the wealth of their toponyms around Russia: V\u00f3lga, L\u00e1doga, On\u00e9ga, V\u00fdchegda etc. The wave of Slav settlers that came in the wake of Varangian colonization swamped them. They were too few, and probably just retreated farther and farther north and east, until they ran out of place. Hence, just distant traces of them in my DNA. Poles My paternal DNA shows that my male ancestors came to the great Russian plains from the northern side of the Carpathians mountains. This is totally consistent with the genetic maps that say that Poles, Lithuanians and Russians are basically close blood brothers, only divided by the language and cultural history. Despite the Mongols, starting from the 13th century, Poland, Lithuania and Muscovy, in terms of trade and human interactions formed one interconnected ethnic body. People from east and west met, traded, raped, loved each other\u2014and now it\u2019s close to impossible to disentangle Poles and Russians from each other in genetic terms. If the Poles hadn\u2019t botched it all in the early 17th century, we could have been one splendid Polish-Russian empire by now. Me I\u2019m a cautious, brainy guy with a lot of emotional antennas and an acute sense of danger. My dad was also like me. Which makes me think that heavenly forces programmed the entire chain of my ancestors with a strong preference for playing it safe and not seeking unnecessary adventures. This snippet of code in our brains protected all of us through many centuries. It helped us survive from the time of nomadic plundering along the borders of the Russian taiga through the carnage of Polish, Swedish and Napoleonic wars\u2014all of them walking through my ancestral lands in western Russia\u2014up to the very uncertain era of world wars and Stalinism. Conclusion Varangians may have laid the foundation of the Russian culture, but their genetic and cultural footprint in today\u2019s Russia is insignificant. Slavs, with some addition of Finno-Ugric blood in the north, Turkic blood in the east and south, and Balkan one in the west, are the dominant ethnicity in the Russian heartland. Much of the alien additions happened throughout history in the Cumanic prairies. Especially Cossacks were a wild mixture of genes due to the specificity of their frontier lifestyle. However, wars were taking their toll, generation after generation. And then the Soviet rule came to town, wary of any self-aware ethnicity that could offer resistance. Decossackisation and other ethnic cleansings followed\u2014and this erased much of the ethnic diversity you may have expected to find in Russia. In other words, unless you happen to hit some pockets of genetic aberrations or the proliferating communities of expats and ethnic guest workers, you\u2019re bound to find in Russia people like me: plain, unadulterated Slavs. ",

            "answer_text": "No, most modern Ukrainians, Belarusians and Russians would have little if any Scandinavian ancestry. North Russians probabaly would have some, but I dont believe its overwhelmimg. I think the misunderstanding here comes from two points. 1\u2013 If Scandinavians were ruling in Kiev, this must mean eastern Slavs were Vikings. This is a big misunderstanding, because just because several Scandinavians were brought to Slavic lands to rule and keep the peace, does not mean they had a large genetic impact. 2\u2013 Misunderstanding of what a Viking is. Viking is not an ethnic designation, but rather a trade. While it is believed the Rus were from Sweden, there is also a possibility that they were not Scandinavian at all. For example, there were many \u201cVikings\u201d of Slavic, Baltic and Finnic origin that dominated the Baltic sea and enjoyed close contacts with Scandinavians. Could the original Rus Vikings have been Slavic, or a Scandinavian-Slavic mixture? I am not saying this was the case, but I think this is an interesting point and calls for more research. While the Scandinavian Rus could have led to the name of Russia, it is also possible that Rus itself has a Slavic origin. Many peoples living in North East Europe in ancient times bore similar names, including certain Scythian tribes. In addition, rulers of Rus are later recorded worshiping Slavic gods and observing Slavic customs, instead of Scandinavian. This indicates that they either adopted Slavic culture quickly, or were originally part of or at least influenced by Slavic culture. Yes, there is plenty of Scandinavian artifacts left behind in burials throughout Ruthenia, all the way to the Volga. I am sure that there were ethnic Norse on today's eastern Slavic territories. But just because they bear similar culture with Norse does not mean they were purely Norse. It could also mean they are influenced by Norse culture from exposure in the Baltic. I personally believe that the Scandinavian connection is often overstated. Yes, Swedes could have come to Kiev. But they also could have been Scando-Slavic Vikings, or of partial Baltic or Finnic ancestry. We might never know for sure, but it might be a possibility. I am pretty sure that most of the Viking raiders attacking Byzantium were not Norse, but Slavs (with a possible Norse elite). Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians are mixed with other people groups though, even though they are Slavic. Most of Belarus has a very strong Baltic substratum, as Slavs absorbed Baltic peoples in the region during their expansion. Ukrainians are very Slavic, but have absorbed certain Turkic and Cirassian peoples in the South East, as well as Scythians. Northern Russian Slavs show more genetic similarities with ethnic non Slavic Finns and Estonians than other North Slavs, such as Poles, Belarusians, Ukrainians, etc.. ",

            "answer_text": "Russians were Nordic people, they were called varangians and they shared the same blood with vikings Sweds, Finns and whoever inhabited Northern area, It was before they conquered the city of Kiev in 9th century and before they adopted name \u201drussians\u201d The conquest of Kiev by Rurik was in the 9th century. Notice that Russians were not called Russians before they conquered Kiev. They called varangians.  WHO WAS RURIK? The ethnicity of Rurik himself is disputable but because the word rurik sounds germanic, historians assumed that he was from German or English speaking part of Western Europe or Sweden. According to Rus' Chronicles, before seizing the power in Kiev, Oleg was living in Ladoga area (Old Norse: Aldeigjuborg) and in Novgorod The Great. MIGRATION INSIDE OF RUSSIA: During 1000 years of Russian history Rus expanded and become Russia, Russia expanded and become Russian empire. From little Kievan Rus, Russia become the empire and in the peak of her size Russian empire covered 3 continents : Europe, Asia and America (Alaska). Russian Empire was absorbing to the Russian entity more and more ethnics and different phenotypes. Contrary to British and Spanish colonists, Russia never genocided the local population of conquered territories. Except of the battlefields Russian government was friendly to new citizens. Finns got full exaption of paying taxes for example. Now imagine how many new ethnics were absorbed in Russian entity during the expansions. And then take in consideration that after the defeat of Napoleon army, most of French POWs settled down in Russian city of Saratov, became Russians, they married local women. Then imagime how many babies were born from occupants during the ww1 in the Russian empire and during the ww2 in the USSR. After the ww2 Stalin mixed population of USSR purposivly to eliminate nationalism and future clash between ethnics. My paternal ancestors are originally Nordic people from the North of Russia from City of Arkhangelsk, some of them moved to south of Ukraine in 1950-s. Now they are classified as ukranians and they are pushed to love anti-russian government in Ukraine. In 1930s my maternal ancestors moved from the Western Ukraine to the Far East of Russia to Vladivostok so now they are classified as Russians. GENETIC RESEARCH: Genetic research shows that Russians share the same DNA with all Western, Nordic, Southern and Central population of Europe. In Russia you can find all european phenotypes because Russia is multi-ethnic country since the beginning of 9th century of Rus. MIGRATION FROM WESTERN EUROPE TO RUSSIA: Thousand years ago all europeans were mobile and they all the time moved from the place to another . Varangians are a good example of the mobility and travels of peoples from one end of the continent to another, meaning that Celts, Germanics, Latinates, Huns and God knows who else wandered all over the Europe and freely moved over the territory of modern Russia , rendering the idea of any specific area of Russia belonging to any specific culture or \u201crace\u201d meaninless. HOW RUSSIA GOT HER NAME AND HOW THE CONQUEST OF KIEV CHANGED THE ENTITY OF RURIK PEOPLE RELIGIOUSLY AND ETHNICALLY: Kievan Rus practiced Judaism before adopted Christianity. The word [Rus/Ros] is Greek form of Hebrew word [\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9] means the head, the leader, the ruler. The name \u201cRus\u201d as the name of the country appeared in letters only after Kiev was conquered by Ruriks in 9th century. It how varangians under of Rurik become Russians. At the time of Rurikis conquered Kiev in 9th century, Novgorod and other Northern cities were still practicing polytheism:  Slavic God Veles:  Russian spring Godness Kupala:  However Kiev was Jewish already for centuries before Ruriks defeated Khazarian Kaganat and conquered Kiev, the city of Kiev practiced Judaism. Kiev was Jewish city because Khazars, owners of Kiev, were Jewish tribes despite that ethnically most of them were not Jewish but Turks . After being defeated by Rurikis, Khazars continued to live in Kiev and they continued to practice Judaism and write letters in Hebrew language. Oleg of Novgorod - Wikipedia  THE SCHECHTER LETTER. ARCHIVES: The Schechter Letter, a document written by a Jewish Khazar a contemporary of Romanus I Lecapenus, describes the activities of a Rus' warlord named HLGW (Hebrew: \u05d4\u05dc\u05d2\u05d5), usually transcribed as \"Helgu\". For years many scholars disregarded or discounted the SchechterLetter account, which referred to Helgu (often interpreted as Oleg) as late as the 940s. Recently, however, scholars such as David Christian and Constantine Zuckerman have suggested that the Schechter Letter's account is corroborated by various other Russian chronicles, and suggests a struggle within the early Rus' polity between factions loyal to Oleg and to the Rurikid Igor, a struggle that Oleg ultimately lost. Zuckerman posited that the early chronology of the Rus' had to be re-determined in light of these sources. Among Zuckerman's beliefs and those of others who have analyzed these sources are that the Khazars did not lose Kiev until the early 10th century (rather than 882, the traditional date), that Igor was not Rurik's son but rather a more distant descendant, and that Oleg did not immediately follow Rurik but rather that there is a lost generation between the legendary Varangian lord and his documented successors. Of particular interest is the fact that the Schechter Letter account of Oleg's death (namely, that he fled to and raided FRS, tentatively identified with Persia, and was slain there) bears remarkable parallels to the account of Arab historians such as Ibn Miskawayh, who described a similar Rus\u2019 attack on the Muslim state of Arran in the year 944/5.} THE BRIEF HISTORICAL OVERVIEW : 100AD. After the expell from Jewish Kingdom, part of Jewish tribes settled down in Caucasus region, around the Black sea and around the southern part of Volga river. Surrounding by local pagan tribes of Goths , Romans and others, Jews were extremely messianic in that period of time. It was the time that Islam didn't exist yet. Christianity didn't exist yet. Jewish tribes was only monotheistic in that area at the time. 600AD . When Turk nomadictribes came around to the Black sea they befriended very educated jews, converted to Judaism and become <Khazarin Kaganat>. They enjoyed each other company and conquests for the next 400 years and they continued together to conquer new territories . They established the city of Kiev. Many Khazarian symbols were in fact Jewish symbols and the name [kaganat] is a Jewish word. Kagans [\u05db\u05d4\u05df ] were highest priests in Holy Jewish Temples in Jerusalem. \u2018Kaganat\u2019 is a 100% Jewish word. In Kiev Khazars were writing letters in Hebrew language, those letters are still kept in archives. \u2018The earliest European reference related to the Rus' people ruled by a khagan comes from the Frankish Annals of St. Bertin, which refer to a group of Norsemen who called themselves Rhos (qui se, id est gentem suam, Rhos vocari dicebant) and visited Constantinople around 838.\u2019 Rus' Khaganate - Wikipedia The name \u201cRus\u201d as the name of the Rurik\u2019 country appeared in letters only after Kiev was conquered by Ruriks in 865.. The word [Rus/Ros] in hebrew [\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9] means the head, the leader, the ruler. \u201cIsraelis call their Prime Minister of Israel Bibi Netanyahu (Hebrew: \u05e8\u05b9\u05d0\u05e9 \u05d4\u05b7\u05de\u05b6\u05bc\u05de\u05b0\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4 \u202c, Rosh HaMemshala, lit. Head of the Government) is the head of government and chief executive of Israel .\u201d-from Wikipedia Cyrillic letters \u201c\u0448\u201d \u201c\u0446\u201d are hebrew letters \u05e6 \u05e9 , in hebrew they called [shin] and [tzadik] respectively. The name of the russian ancient literature character Sadko (rus. \u0421\u0430\u0434\u043a\u043e) came from the Herbrew [\u05e6\u05d3\u05e7] that means righteous. The most popular ukranian male name Bogdan - in Hebrew \u05d1\u05d2\u05d3\u05df translated from Hebrew as the traitor and betrayer. The impact of Judaism and Hebrew language to the future russian culture (russian language, topographic names, alphabet, religion) is enormous. The famous monarch Ivan I was nicknamed as Ivan Kalita because he was the \u2018gatherer and absorber of the Russian lands back to Russia \u2019. In Hebrew the word klita [\u05e7\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8\u05d4] means the absorbtion, the gathering. In Israel we call the ministry of immigration: \u201cMinistry of Immigration and Absorption) (Hebrew: \u05de\u05e9\u05e8\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d4\u05e7\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8\u05d4\u200e, Misrad Ha Alyah VeHa Klita) is a ministry of the Israeli government.\u201d- from Wikipedia. What it means from anthropological and historical perspective? It means that after destruction the city of Kiev by Mongols, Jewish inhabitants moved to Moscow City. Ivan I Daniilovich Kalita (Russian: \u0418\u0432\u0430\u0301\u043d I \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0430; 1288 \u2013 31 March 1340 or 1341) was Grand Duke of Moscow from 1325 and Vladimir from 1332. Ivan I of Moscow - Wikipedia It's very surprising how modern Ukrainians claim that Kiev was ukrainian before it becomes Russian. In fact Kiev was Jewish before it become Russian and only in 1991 Kiev became Ukrainian. Ukranian state didn't existe before 1991. Modern Ukrainian politicians and their Western sponsors are desperately struggling to creat \u201cthe ukranian identity\u201d in order to differenciate from the Russian identity but rejecting their russianness Ukrainians have to deal with Judaism and jewishness. Kiev was Jewish before it becomes Russian. SUCCESSION OF STATES: Russia was born in 9th century in Kiev. It was called Rus. We call it Kievan Rus to distinguish between different historical periods of the Russian history. Kievan Rus included Galicia and the city of Lvov. Rus - >Tsardom of Russia-> Russian empire-> USSR - >Russian Federation is the same country. Changing the name is typical for Russian topography. For example Saint Peterburg was one Petrograd then Leningrad, but is the same city. Succession of states is a well established mechanism in International law whereby a state \u201cinherits\u201d the legal personality of a preceding state in the same \u2014 though not necessarily the exact same \u2014 territory. The Russian Federation is the successor state to the USSR, which was the sucessor state to the Russian Empire, which was the successor state to Tsardom of Russia, which was the successor state to Rus. This is virtually undisputed. Russians still call the country Rus and in literature and poetry although the official name is the Russian Federation. Kievan Rus included not only Kiev. The hotbed of Russians and Russia (before they got the name\u201drus\u201d in 9th century) was city of Novgorod, since the 8th century. City of Lviv: City of Lviv was founded by Russian monarch Daniel in 13 century. From wikipedia : Lviv was named in honour of Leo, the eldest son of Daniel, King of Rus , it was the capital of the Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia (also called the Kingdom of Rus) [The city of Lviv was founded by King Daniel of Galicia (1201\u20141264) in the Principality of Halych of Kingdom of Rus` and named in honour of his son Lev The Capital City: For Russians the full destruction of the capital city (Kiev during the Mongol invasion) means nothing. They just moved thier capital to another city (to Moscow) . It is not the problem because Russia was and still a federation. The Federation : Kievan Rus was federation of different Duches if we operate by modern terminology. Kievan Russia never was centralized state. It was a federation. The centralization in Russia began after 16th century Russia during Mongols period remain the federation. Mongols occupied only southern part of Russia, they didn't go north of Novgorod city. In Russia it was called **Udelnaya Rus **(federative Rus) . Western may call it by the name of duches because the ties between russian duches become very fragile. Mongols in 13th century used the name Rus to call all duches as a Rus. They diffirinciate Rus by colors: Red Rus White Rus Black Rus This color naming convention was influenced by the Mongol invasion, who used them for the cardinal directions, its the ancient Chinese tradition.The name Belarus is a result of that Mongolian topography therefore nobody can claim that during the Mongolian invasion Rus didn't exit. Rus was continued to exist.The SLAVIC QUESTION : Slavic is the linguistic term only related to the group of languages in the Eastern Europe, not to ethnic group and not to the racial classification . The term \u201cslavic\u201d is a linguistic term related exclusively to the group of languages, not to the ethnic groups of people. It was a Hitler\u2019s idea to create a \u201cSlavic race\u201d as well as a \u201cJewish race\u201d. In fact Judaism is a religion, not a race and Slavic is a group of the Eastern European languages,not a race. Both terms are absolutely invalid and unscientific. No one should operate Hitler\u2019 terminology. Hitler race theory was unscientific, politically motivated, he wrote it with the solely political purpose divide and conquer. However Hitler rightfully expected that his false anthropology will be accepted in Germany because Western Europeans always despised Eastern Europeans. No one in Europe questioned the validity of the race theory written by Hitler because the false anthropology was very popular and even fashionable in Europe and USA at the time. For example, Poles and Bulgarians are both linguistically slavic but they belong to completely different ethnic ic groups. Poles are baltic people mostly with blue eyes and light skin. Bulgarians are southerns, probably turk origin mostly with brown eyes and much darker skin then Poles. Russian language is obviously slavic language.

Mongolian (Asiatic) traits, which SOME Slavs may as well share, due to the 13th century Mongol/Tatar invasion, prolonged occupation, rape and enslavement of Slavs in southern regions of Eastern Europe.

Due to heavy intermixing with Mongols and Vikings, with numerous military assaults on Slavs by Asiatic and Nordic tribes dating centuries back, there is no clear historical evidence to show what the \u201coriginal Russian Slavs\u201d might have looked like.  There might be theories and speculations, but nothing concrete.  ",

            "answer_text": "The traditional story goes like this. Around 862 AD some of the East Slavic tribes had an idea that they needed a foreign ruler to unify them and put an end to their tribal conflicts. So they said to the Vikings, also called Varangians: Our land is great and plentiful but there is no order in it. (These words remain very true to this day.)Come to rule and reign over us. Then, according to the chronicle, the Viking chieftain called Rurik came over with his family and his troops and became ruler of these tribes. His seat was in Novgorod. Rurik\u2019s successor Oleg took Kiev, uniting most of the East Slavic lands into a state we now call the Kievan Rus\u2019, which later evolved into Russia.The Rurikids, who were the ruling dynasty in Rus\u2019 and Russia, and countless other noble families claimed descent from Rurik; the last Rurikid monarch was Czar Fyodor (died 1598), son of Ivan the Terrible.  The Varangian theory has been contested since as early as the 18th century. Nowadays there is no single view on the origins of the Russian state. However, even if we accept this theory, it means that anyway the Vikings who settled in what is now Russia weren\u2019t numerous and were quickly assimilated into the Slavic population. They surely did not found Moscow! Moscow is first referenced in chronicles almost three hundred years after Rurik, in 1147 AD. It\u2019s interesting to note that, while Rurik\u2019s descendants were considered the noblest of the noble, the next best thing was to trace your lineage back to some foreign potentate (such as the Lithuanian grand duke Gediminas) or just a sufficiently highly-regarded foreigner who came to live in Russia and swore allegiance to the Russian monarch. Of these there were plenty. Mongol Tartars were the most prominent. Russian lands were under the Mongol yoke for several centuries; Mongol Tartars raped and pillaged and generally had their fun in Russia; later, Russian princes often married high-born Tartar girls to curry political favour. When Russia was finally free, the Golden Horde was falling apart, and not before long its territories were integrated into Russia, and Tartar nobility in their turn seeked to become Russian nobility. The result is that, as someone once said, If you scratch a Russian you\u2019ll find that he\u2019s a Tartar underneath. Of course, it\u2019s true only to an extent (some recent studies have shown that it may not be true at all). ",

            "answer_text": "The Russians do not descend from the Vikings. The Vikings invaded and ruled over the Slavs but they did not alter the Russian DNA. They gave their name to the territory \u2014 \u201cRussia\u201d from Rus-Varangians, \u2014 but they were absorbed by the Slavo-Skythian population. The Russians are primarily a mix of ancient Slavs, Skythians/Sarmatians, Siberians, and Turkic peoples. The original homeland of the Slavs was in Western Ukraine. The Finns (Siberians) lived to the North, while the Scythians/Sarmatians (and later Turkic peoples) lived in the South (Ukraine-Russia-Kuban regions). In the beginning, the Slavs and Scythians/Sarmatians were probably the same people (Nordics) and united as one people during the 5th century AD. However, the migrations of Asiatic peoples from the North and East changed the Russian people. During the Iron Age. The Skythians occupied a huge area from the Vistula River to the Volga River. The Sarmatians then conquered the Skythians. It is almost certain that the majority of Skythian/Sarmatian people carried the R1a Z280 marker and either introduced it to the Slavs or remixed it. Where the ancient Slavs a R1a or I2a1b people? Eastern Slavs (Russians, Belorussians, Poles, and Ukrainians) have on average around 50% R1a and 20% I2a1b. Was the union of Slavs with the Skythian/Sarmatians the result of the R1a? Or were the Slavs and the Skythian/Sarmatians a combination of R1a and I2a1b? During the 5th century the Huns caused other Turkic tribes to invade Central and Eastern Europe. After the Huns, the Avars, Kipchaks, Cumans, Pechenegs, Khazars, Bulgars, etc. all settled and mixed with the Slavo-Skythian population. However, not all Turkic tribes were Asiatic. Some, such as, the Cumans and Khazars were European. Others, such as, the Avars, Huns, and Bulgars, were clearly a mix of European and Asiatic. In genetics, the original R1a M417 mutated into Z280 (Slav/Skythian) and Z93/94 (Asiatic Skythian, Turkic, Iranians, Indians, Afghanis, Pakistanis). The Asiatic Skythians, who migrated East from Russia 3000 years ago, later returned as the Turkic speaking nations and reintroduced more R1a into the Slavs. When the Slavic tribes migrated north they mixed with Finnic-speaking Siberians. Today Russians are 40\u201350% R1a Z280/Z93\u201394, 20% I2a1b and 25% N1c. The R1a comes from Slavs or Skythians and Turks and N1c is Finno-Ugric (Siberian). The Russians who are Nordic come from the Baltic and western Finnish areas because Germans and Swedes (Rus) settled there in large numbers. Viking and German DNA is around 40% I1, 20% R1a Z283\u2013284 and 30% R1b U106. Russians have on average 5% I1 and 6% R1b and almost 0% R1a Z283\u2013284. In conclusion, the Varangian/Rus (Vikings) made little genetic impact. All conquerors make little contribution to the genetic pool unless they bring their families and stay. Slavs are not a race. They are \u201cSlavic\u201d because of their language. Language does not designate a race or ethnicity. Thus Russians are neither \u201cSlav\u201d nor Viking but a mix of several peoples who speak Slavic. However, the most accurate designation of Russians would be Slavo-Skythians. ",

            "answer_text": " Not Moscow, but Kiev. The Rus' were an early medieval group or people who gave their name to the lands of Russia, Ruthenia , and Belarus. Their nature, origin and identity are much in dispute. Most Western scholars believe them to be a group of Varangians , specifically Norsemen. According to the Primary Chronicle , compiled in about 1113 AD, the Rus' had relocated \"from over sea\", first to northeastern Europe, creating an early polity that finally came under the leadership of Rurik .  One of the earliest written sources mentioning the people called Rus' (as Rhos) dates back to year 839 in a Carolingian chronicle from Francia, the Annales Bertiniani; the Carolingians identified them as a Germanic tribe called the Swedes. According to the Kievan Rus' Primary Chronicle, compiled in about 1113, the Rus' were a group of Varangians, Norsemen who had relocated somewhere from the Baltic region (literally \"from beyond the sea\"), first to Northeastern Europe, then to the south where they created the medieval Kievan state. According to the most prevalent theory, the name Rus', like the Finnish name for Sweden (Ruotsi), is derived from an Old Norse term for \"the men who row\" (rods-) as rowing was the main method of navigating the rivers of Eastern Europe, and that it could be linked to the Swedish coastal area of Roslagen (Rus-law) or Roden, Sweden , as it was known in earlier times. The name Rus' would then have the same origin as the Finnish and Estonian names for Sweden: Ruotsi and Rootsi. According to the earliest East Slavic record, the Primary Chronicle, the Rus' were a group of Varangians who lived, along with other groups like Swedes and Gotlander , on the other side of the Baltic Sea, in Scandinavia and as far as the land of the English and the French. The Varangians were first expelled, then invited to rule the warring Slavic and Finnic tribes of Novgorod. Later, the Primary Chronicle tells us, they conquered Kiev and created the state of Kievan Rus' (which, as most historians agree,[citation needed] was preceded by the Rus' Khaganate ). The territory they conquered was named after them as were, eventually, the local people. Having settled Aldeigja (Ladoga) in the 750s, Scandinavian colonists played an important role in the early ethnogenesis of the Rus' people and in the formation of the Rus' Khaganate. The Varangians (Varyags, in Old East Slavic) are first mentioned by the Primary Chronicle as having exacted tribute from the Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859. It was the time of rapid expansion of the Vikings in Northern Europe; England began to pay Danegeld in 859, and the Curonians of Grobin faced an invasion by the Swedes at about the same date. The Varangians left a number of rune stones in their native Sweden that tell of their journeys to what is today Russia, Ukraine, Greece, and Belarus. Most of these rune stones can be seen today, and are a telling piece of historical evidence. The Varangian runestones tell of many notable Varangian expeditions, and even account for the fates of individual warriors and travelers. Source: Rus' people ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, some are. Most Russians are mostly Slavic descent, some European Jewish DNA in those with Jewish family members. Some Russians have \u201cother\u201d Eastern DNA; like from Austria etc. But a fair amount do indeed have Scandinavian DNA. Here\u2019s a forum entry where a Russian posted his DNA results and was surprised at the presence of Scandinavian DNA. However, in contrast, you are more likely to have Scandinavian DNA if you have ancestors from Normandy, or the traditional Scandinavian ancestors. Scotland is another hotspot. Another misconception is the Delta-32 gene (which protects you against HIV, Smallpox and possibly other viral pathogens). This gene is VERY high in Russia [1] and other slavic states like Poland [2], many believe it was disseminated by Vikings, but the origin points to North Germany and Spain - making it more likely that either ONLY specific Viking families created the circumstances for it (Swedes vs Danes) or that it was the Vandals and Visgoths of Northern German stock who conquered Spain and Rome at one point [3]. So perhaps, one could argue that Russia is of \u201cDIVERSE\u201d Scandinavian ancestry, but not CONCENTRATED in the traditional sense [4]. Either way, this explains the utter and superior STRENGTH of Russian athletes [5] etc \u2026having both Slavic and Northern DNA makes for some POWERFUL blood! ~Dan Gregory of Area-1255 Blog: www.area1255.blogspot.com ",

(Incidentally the name Russia is derived from the word for rowers, \u201cRus\u201d, which the Vikings did.) Vikings were the most successful invaders of the period. They established kingdoms in what is now England, Normandy, (from the French word for Vikings - Normans, Norsemen), and I believe as far as Italy. The invasion of 1066 involved one Viking descendant, William the Conqueror, invading of another kingdom descended in part from Viking overlords. As often happens, succeeding generations intermarried and blended into the existing populations. In part that is how English became English. A Germanic language received an overlay of French which blended and transformed into our wonderful language with so many words to allow us to be precise in description. So the huge majority of the population were Slavs, with an overlay of Vikings and I would assume that present day Russians descended from them have equivalent amounts of DNA in them. Mostly they\u2019re Slavs. IMHO. ",

They stayed, and what with people doing stuff like getting married and having children, chances are that most modern Russians have a Scandinavian somewhere in their ancestry. They also all have lots and lots of Slavs. I probably have a Russian or two somewhere in my ancestry, too. The Vikings brought slaves from all over, including what is today Russia. Their great-great-great-grandchildren didn\u2019t feel a pressing need to go to a country they hadn\u2019t even heard of when slavery was abolished in 1135, and by then they were mostly Scandinavian anyway.

There were few tribes, who paid tribute to Varyags. One day the managed to chase the varyags off, and after that they started fighting each other. So. They decided to call a lord (\u043a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c) to govern them. So they apparently went to Varyags again and asked one of them to govern them. And that\u2019s how Rus started. \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0433\u043e\u0432 \u2014 \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f Now, this is the place where you need a real historian, because apparently there are uncertainties (whether Varyags were Vikins or Germans), but it seems they were of Skandinavian origin. Now, Moscow.I have not heard of Moscow starting as Viking settlement. \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 \u2014 \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f Actual age of moscow is unknown (first settlement in the area are 8 thousands years old), but it is first mention in 1147 in some records. Moscow was not always Russian capital, initial capital of Russia was Ladoga. \u0421\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044b \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u2014 \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f If you want more details, you\u2019re gonna need a real historian, though.

            "answer_text": "European Russians are genetically a mix of 45% East European and 45% West European/Norse/Finno-Ural. And 25% of male Russian dna is Germanic-Norse. The East European cluster today is a meeting place of many origins, positioned between two important trade routes, from Scandinavia-Balticum to the Black Sea, and from the Eurasian steppes to Asia Minor and Persia. The Scandinavians traded metals there already from 1600BC with the farmers from Asia Minor, and later came the Persians and Greeks, with big Scandinavian-Germanic migration. The Balts and the Slavs came later and moved from the Urals by Moscow towards the Baltic Sea in Byzantian times, when Slavs equalled slaves for the East Roman empire. And then the Bulgars ruled, and the Norse Varangian Vikings ruled the East Slavs as Rus, followed by Turkish migrations and Mongolian invaders. Linguistic is one thing and genetics is another. So if you have East European roots, they include all of these. When you look at dominant Y haplo groups, Russians have 46,5% East Indo European R1a (while Sweden has 25%), 4\u201314% West European metal workers R1b (Sweden 13%), 23,5% Danish-West Germanic I (Sweden 35\u201340%) and 10% Finnish-Uralic N (Sweden 15%). So there is more Eastern European and less West Germanic and Finnish DNA in Russians than in Swedes, but the mix is clear. ",

            "answer_text": "Technically (and genetically), Russians as whole are not descendants of Scandinavian Vikings, though you could find all Scandinavian types in north of European Russia (I visit all these areas personally, so I know what I say). Scandinavian types are haplogroups I1, R1b, N and R1a. I can say definitely about I1 group due to its peculiar gothic appearance with humped noses and dark hair (you may look up for pic of Joachim L\u00f6w, coach of German national football team). I would give this group 10\u201320 % in this region but I don't think they are vikings descendants, they are rather autochthonous population of this area. Most of those russians who have I group, have I2 variation, that is obviously from South Europe Slavs and doesn't occur in Scandinavia. About Normanic theory, why not? If you compare time of first appearance of Vikings in West Europe with time when Rorik was summoned to rule Novgorod region it will turned out that both these stories were happening at the same time!

Saying that Russians descended from Vikings is same as saying they descended from accountants. Vikings - Wikipedia Slavic, Germanic, and Norse ethnic groups all engaged in looting. Norse were mostly Viking because they moved around with boats, while others moved across land. Slavic people looted a lot in the east, and made a go for Constantinople. Occupation of all ethnic groups was kind of the same, just that Vikings used boats. Just as their pagan religions were more or less the same before they all adopted Christianity Slavic Perun is Norse Thor, for example. ",

            "answer_text": "Too a small degree probably, Norse settlers (most notably Swedes) did settle around places in what would become the Kiev-Rus Realm, most notably areas around Kiev, Novgorod (Holmg\u00e5rd) and Smolensk, and around the rivers in the region. However the lands were far from uninhabited, there were plenty of Slavic and Finnic tribes in the area and even though Norsemen definitely settled quite heavily in some areas they were a small minority in most places. The vikings did however largerly replace or intermarry with the established elite of the areas and had a much larger influence amongst the nobility and townsfolk than on the countryside. So the higher up on the societal ladder the more Norsemen it were. Nowadays this Norse blood is probably so diluted that most ethnic Russians have a share in it and for most Russians, it\u2019s probably just a small part of their genetic heritage. If it would be any Russians that have a quite high percentage it would be people living in the original Norse-settled areas and the descendants of Russias medieval nobility. ",

The rulers soon began to use Slavic names, in the second half of the 900s also the Slavic language. Seems there was a big influence from Scandinavia, intermarriage and good relations.
