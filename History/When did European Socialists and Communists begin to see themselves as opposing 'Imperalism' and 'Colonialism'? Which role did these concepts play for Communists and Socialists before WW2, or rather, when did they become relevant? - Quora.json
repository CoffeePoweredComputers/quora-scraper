            "answer_text": "I decided to write an answer, as just a one comment does not give full picture. My Main thesis would be that European social democracies by there nature imperialistic. They exist on base of imperialism, they would not exist with out imperialisms. We would start with contemporary definition of imperialism as created by Lenin. Basically, imperialism is a way for capital to expand outside it origins. Capital can not exist with out expansion and always create excess of capital. Reason for that lie in capitalism contradictions. Alexei Gladkikh's answer to What are the flaws in capitalism? As you can see, Capital need to recycle it\u2019s profits somehow, otherwise there would not be demand for what it produce. The most natural mechanism of recycling is expansion. Build more factories, expand into new markets. So, after capital completely expand into country of origin ( at current level of technology), It look for other markets. At that what is roots of imperialism. 18\u201319 century empires state monopolies markets for capital by military means. French capital can not sell it commodity to English colonies and otherwise.After WW2 it begin to use other ways to enforce imperialism, mostly international financial organizations and mighty dollar. So, before WW1 there was no division between Socialist or Communists. This terms were used interchangeably. Split Started at start of WW1, with dissolution of second international. European socialist with exception of Bolsheviks supported there Nation empires. Bolsheviks did not. So, when Bolsheviks come to power in Russia, split become open. Parties that supported Russian revolution and anti-imperialism begin to called themselves Communists. Other start to called themselves Socialist.From that time to now, why have some time anti- imperialist rhetoric, de facto all European socialist parties support there national imperialism. This is a base of there social contract with national capital.Lenin explained it in \u201cState and revolution\u201d. High wages and good working condition in imperial core only possible because of supper exploitations of periphery. Because of surplus transfer from outside. There are a lots of evidence of that. Even when France Socialists come to power they did not stop and pay back debt which Haiti got as result of there successful slave revolt.Haitian Revolution - WikipediaFrance as condition of peace and independence of Haiti impious debt for lost property (Slaves).I believe Haiti continue to pay of this debt until now. One would think Socialist would abolish this debt and pay back what ever Haiti pay to France? Nope.Sweden prosperity base on weapon export, other imperialist activity. You can read about France or British treatment of there colonies even when Socialists were in power. Does not make different for international policy, are Socialist in power or Conservatives. That is basis of European social democracies, creation and maintained of national workers aristocracy.European claim that they \u201cHelp\u201d Africa, but even now Capital constantly extracted from Africa. In reality, at the moment European Socialist in position to do something to stop economic imperialisms, they do not. They support there National Capital. Edit: Additional point. Not a single EU country exit NATO, which is main tool of imperialism right now. NATO has no other purpose. ",

            "answer_text": "In Germany Socialists and Social Democrats opposed colonialism since the beginning in the 19th century. German colonialism was mostly pushed by traders and merchants from the port cities of Hamburg and Bremen, who wanted to cut out the British or French middlemen when importing goods from tropical countries. Their pleas found open ears with our imbecile emperor, who was in a willy-waving contest mainly with his British cousin and the likes of Admiral Tirpitz, who wanted a big navy. Colonialism was mostly a bourgeois project from which the German workers of the time, who were represented mostly by the SPD, did not profit from. Quite the contrary: Aquiring and holding the colonies against the resistance of the locals and building the navy cost a lot of tax money paid by everybody, but profits went to a small group of the population only.

            "answer_text": "Socialists, including communists, have pretty much always opposed imperialism and colonialism. There hasn't really been a period where socialists weren't opposed to thse things. Socialism is about people owning their own labor and the products thereof. This is naturally in opposition towards stealing the wealth of others, which is what imperialism and colonialism is. ",
