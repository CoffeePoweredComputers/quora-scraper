Homicide has been effective in preventing harm to self or family, protecting reputation and social status, protecting resources, and eliminating competition for resources (to the extent of elimination of \u201cdefective\u201d individuals, even if genetically related) (Duntley & Buss, 2008). Social order has evolved more quickly than the physiological apparatus (i.e., our brains) that operationalizes thought leading to behavior; meaning that the trait of aggression is still ingrained biologically. Walsh and Beaver (2008, p. 23) stated that \u201cthe suite of traits useful for focusing on mating effort includes deceitfulness,impulsiveness, sensation-seeking, and aggression; traits useful for focusing on parenting effort include empathy, conscientiousness, and altruism.\u201d  Apparently, as life has been facilitated by technological advancement, and scarce resources have therefore become less scarce, the pro-social parenting traits have become more in evidence. \u201cOur ancestors were far more violent than we are, that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time, and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence. \u2026 Until 10,000 years ago, all humans lived as hunter-gatherers, without permanent settlements or government. \u2026 Looking at casualty rates among contemporary hunter-gatherers,which is our best source of evidence about this way of life,has shown \u2026 (an) almost a 60 percent chance that a man will die at the hands of another man, \u2026 (when compared to) the 20th century, there would have been two billion deaths rather than 100 million\u201d (Pinker,2007).

            "answer_text": "There is no human race. Unless there is a cat, dog, zebra, elephant or gold fish race. Humans are a unique animal. Humans are not a natural animal. Humans are an artificial animal. As with all animals, there are breeds of humans. Humans have an inflated idea of themselves as somehow being not animal. Yes, the modern human species is inherently violent. Some breeds of humans are more violent than others. For the human to breed, violence was necessary as a part of survival of the fittest. Violence comes out of climate and environmental changes on the Earth. The most violent came from the harshest changing climates. Stable, human favorable climates and environments produced the less violent breeds of humans. As the migration patterns of the humans expanded so did their need for violence. With the advent of the tribe and civilization violence became necessary for survival of the fittest. The modern day human is responsible for the extinction of the Homo sapiens. The Homo sapiens are the cause of the extinction of earlier Homo species.  The human is the only species of animal that kills freely, for entertainment and out of principal. The human breeds other animals solely the purposes of killing and slaughter. The truly amazing thing about the human is that speak of peace, love and nonviolence but that they are the most violent animal on Earth. The Human is the only animal that will kill itself in the fight for survival. ",
