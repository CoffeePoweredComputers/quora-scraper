            "answer_text": "Cuneiform, from the Latin cuneus, meaning \"wedge,\" is the term applied to a mode of writing which used a wedge-shaped stylus to make impressions on a clay surface, and also on stone, metal, and wax.  Most of the clay tablets were sun-baked, making surviving tablets very fragile. This technique originated in ancient southern Mesopotamia and the earliest texts in cuneiform script are about 5000 years old. Cuneiform writing was probably invented by the Sumerians but was subsequently adapted for writing in the Akkadian language, of which Babylonian and Assyrian are dialects.  This writing was invented in the ancient Near East in order to record business activities, but tablets containing medical texts and other subjects have also been found. ",
