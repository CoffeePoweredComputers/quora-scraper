            "answer_text": "You\u2019d be surprised to know how few, maybe 25% of all Southerners owned slaves. When we think of the Antebellum South and slavery we think of the sprawling plantations owned by Big Daddy and Calvin Candy in Django Unchained but those actually represented a wealthy minority. However, those large plantation owners did have a disproportionate influence Southern society, politics and economics. The planter class dominated the South. They held most public offices, owned banks, stores, newspapers and steamboats along with what railroads and factories there were. The planter class were the architects of secession and it makes sense since they had everything to lose if slavery were to be abolished by a Republican-led federal government in Washington. Most field-grade officers (major & above) in the Confederate armies owned slaves but a small minority of rank & file Confederate soldiers owned slaves. Even though the rank & file were not slaveholders, per se, they did have a vested interest in defending slavery as the South\u2019s entire economic system was based on plantation agriculture and slave labor. Even if a yeoman farmer didn\u2019t own slaves, he almost certainly did business with someone who did. Need to transport your crops to market? Slave owners control the steam boats and railroads. Need to get a loan to expand your farm? Guess who owns the bank? Northern industrialists were implicated in slavery, too but that is a topic for another question. A significant motivation for rank & file Confederate soldiers to fight was the defense of white supremacy in the South. Primary sources of the time make it crystal clear where they stood on the issue here\u2019s an example: Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth. This truth has been slow in the process of its development, like all other truths in the various departments of science Excerpt from the Cornerstone Speech; March 21, 1861 Alexander Stephens; Vice-President, Confederate States of America As the war progressed the South began conscripting men to fight for secession but granted exemption to any man who owned 20 or more slaves. This policy caused outrage among the troops who, according to Private Sam Watkins, 1st Tennessee Regiment, took up the cry of \u201cRich man\u2019s war; poor man\u2019s fight.\u201d Of course not all Confederate troops fought solely for the defense of slavery and a social caste system based in white supremacy. Many fought because of intense social pressure from family and friends (no one wanted to be thought a coward). Others fought out of intense loyalty to their own home state and some fought, as so eloquently put by Civil War historian Shelby Foote, \u201cBecause you\u2019re down here.\u201d History, real history, is complex. No doubt each individual Confederate soldier fought, as all soldiers do, for their own reasons which had to have been as numerous, complex and contradictory as the war itself that may have had little to do with the Confederacy\u2019s stated goal of preserving slavery.

            "answer_text": "The figures quoted by Mr. Parmar in his answer are pretty correct, as I understand them. Few Confederate soldiers owned slaves, just as few American soldiers own houses. But that doesn't mean they didn't want to or didn't hope to one day. About 32% of Southern families owned slaves. This is a somewhat misleading statistic though because it includes the entire population of the states that seceded, and therefore includes areas like East Tennessee and West Virginia where few people owned slaves and where Union sentiment ran high. About 46% of families in South Carolina and 49% of families in Mississippi owned slaves. Again, that does not tell the whole story. Many people who did not own slaves hoped to one day - cotton grown by slave labor was the road to wealth and power in the antebellum South. Furthermore, many people who did not own slaves profited from the slave based economy in one way or another. As a general rule, if you want to know the regions of the CSA that were not part of the slave economy, look for the places that remained loyal. If you're interested in the actual role that slavery played in the minds of Southerners who rebelled, I recommend you read \u201cWhat this cruel war was over: Soldiers, Slavery and the Civil War\u201d by Chandra Manning. Spoiler alert: it wasn't \u201cstates rights\u201d. FWIW, and on the other hand, some historians have estimated that half the population of the South opposed the Confederacy. If this is a subject you are interested in I recommend \u201cThe South vs The South: How anti-Confederate Southerners shaped the course of the Civil War\u201d by William W. Freehling. ",
