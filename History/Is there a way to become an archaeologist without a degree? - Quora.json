To be a true archaeologist you have to have studied about the culture you\u2019re interested in as well as the principles of how to dig, etc., Without that knowledge, every artifact you find is suspect to the actual age because you have to be able to identify the layer from which it came (provenance) from which it came. The earliest \u201carchaeologists\u201d, for example Schulman who discovered Troy was not an archaeologist but is looked upon by the archaeological community as more of a grave-robber as were the others of his time & before. As mentioned below, you can work as a \u2018digger\u2019 at a site but you would be under the supervision of an archaeologist who would tell you where and how to uncover your square. ",

You can be a digger without one, its a tough, insecure, poorly paid, interesting life Not all archaeologists dig every day of their working life , as a finds specialist in 40 years about 150 days I think I calculated once have I been on site ",
