            "answer_text": "Tyrannosaurus rex may have been the apex predator of North America but even the \u201ctyrant king\u201d would have had plenty to fear. One small injury and the theropod could be put out of hunting for a long while, and you know what that means\u2026.. starvation. First and foremost of the T. rex\u2019s fears would be\u2026  \u201cCome at me bro!!!\u201d \u2026other tyrannosaurs of course! The only other predators that could match a tyrant king in battle is another Tyrannosaurus and while full on death battles wouldn\u2019t have been common place, bouts over territory, food and mating rites were bound to happen. But other predators aren\u2019t the only things to be wary of. What if the prey strikes back?  Triceratops-\u201cThey call me the three-horned lord!\u201d T. rex-\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound right\u2026\u201d Triceratops-\u201cNot that type of three-horned lord you sick minded carnivore!\u201d Triceratops was a large, wide bodied, elephant sized herbivore armed with three razor sharp horns. I think at first glance anyone could see why this dinosaur would be a danger as just one strike from those horns could easily kill a Tyrannosaurus rex. If these herbivores lived in herds or were as ill tempered as modern day large herbivores, then things would be even worse for the tyrant king. I think its safe to say that the Tyrannosaurus rex would have its fair share of fear or at very least respect for this mighty plant eater.  \u201cStand back!!! You don\u2019t have the same plot armor as Indominus!\u201d Tyrannosaurus may have been specialized at taking down armored prey like Triceratops and Ankylosaurus but people often fail to remember that these herbivores were also specialized to defend themselves from this apex predator! Ankylosaurus was no exception and was equipped with a powerful tail club which could be swung with enough force to shatter bone. One good hit to the leg and the Tyrannosaurus would likely die whether it be instantly or via starvation.  \u201cLooks like I win at this arms race Mr T. rex!\u201d While it may come as a surprise that Edmontosaurus is on this list I think its safe to say that T. rex would have a bit of respect for a healthy specimen. Why? For one Edmontosaurus was the same size as T. rex so one good shove or kick could send the tyrant reeling to the ground and as many of you probably know\u2026once a T. rex falls it may never get up. Even worse, these guys lived in massive herds. I think a Tyrannosaurus would definitely stear clear of a large group or risk getting trampled.  \u201cOh look at that! I\u2019ve been impaled!\u201d Like its relative Ankylosaurus, Denversaurus was a armored herbivore built to defend itself from the likes of Tyrannosaurus rex but instead of a powerful tail club, this dinosaur was armed with massive shoulder spikes. It isn\u2019t really known if Denversaurus used its sharp protrusions as a defensive weapon, but whatever the case it\u2019s likely that T. rex had some fear for them.  Tries to break up a fight\u2026.get\u2019s beaten-up by both! While its undecided if Torosaurus was indeed one and the same as Triceratops, I side with those who believe it was at least its own distinct species. Whatever the case, Torosaurus was armed with three deadly horns and just like Triceratops, T. rex would have some fear for this herbivore.  Some Honorable mentions: Dakotaraptor was a mid sized carnivore that would have been a threat to juvenile Tyrannosaurs. If they lived in packs then I can even imagine them posing threat to adult T. rex.Acheroraptor, Anzu and Ornithomimids may have caused baby Tyrannosaurus fear as these young-lings would be too small to defend themselves.Alamosaurus would also have been a threat to any Tyrannosaurus that took it on. With its size, one kick or tail swipe could kill a tyrant king. The only reason this dino isn\u2019t higher on the list is because an adult animal and the T. rex would have rarely come into aggressive contact. \u201cSize chart of the Hell creek dinosaurs and Alamosaurus\u201d As you can see Tyrannosaurus would have had its fair share of fears. Even the life of an apex predator would have been difficult! Hope this helps and please excuse any inaccuracies in the images! Sources: Hell Creek Formation - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "There are only a few dinosaurs that an adult t rex would have been afraid of: another adult t rex, seismosaurus, and utahraptor(s). An adult t rex can do the same as another adult t rex, and one bite from the other t rex would be fatal. A seismosaurus would be simply to big to not be afraid of. Utahraptors are something everything would be afraid of. likely pack hunters, these beasts had killing claws on all its limbs, and its claws up to a foot long. With superior jumping capabilities, it could jump onto the sides of whatever it intended to kill, short of an ankylosaur, and take a second to stab its victim. Then, it would simply jump off and wait for it to bleed to death. for an ankylosaur, they would dart around it and every now and then make a run for it, biting or slashing at its legs. once the ankylosaur had taken several wounds, all the dromeosaurs had to do was wait for it to tire and fall over out of exhaustion. No sauropod, theropod or ankylosaur was safe around the dreaded utahraptor. ",
