            "answer_text": "Do you mean today\u2019s eastern Germany, which used to be the former East? It\u2019s still yet to keep up with the west side, and may take another decade or so to completely fill in the gaps. They reunited with the west, and as a result introduced democracy when the bubble was just about to burst. People expected the reunification to bring on rapid economic growth. But right after the bubble economy, the recession would take its toll in western Europe ( including western Germany ), Japan, and the US. That\u2019s what further slowed down the healing process of the scar from the Cold War. Eastern Germany still suffers from slightly lower living conditions, with unemployment higher than the west. People in the west are more likely to drive BMWs, whereas the easterners would probably opt for a Skoda, which is more economical. As the east adopted values from the communist era, it can still be a struggle to change, as they were used to living frugally. ",

People, especially at that time like when I was a young child, you learnt to adapt and to find the simple joys in day to day life. Non-Ex-DDR citizens have very wide views and opinions, for people who never stepped foot into the DDR. And those of us from the DDR, the ones with the opinions of substance and validity - you got 3 types of general view: 1) It was a nightmare and I never want to think of it again, 2) It wasnt ideal but we got by anyway, 3) It was my home and Ill always be a DDR citizen.
