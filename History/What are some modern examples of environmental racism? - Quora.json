            "answer_text": "Good question... There are a few examples of environmental racism that I can think of the top of my head and that I find particularly egregious. One is hurricane Katrina (in 2008) and the other is the Flint water crisis (in 2014). In both cases our government (state and federal) blatantly and unequivocally failed to protect it's black citizens many of whom were poor and/or low income. And instead of doing what we all know would've been done in a heatbeat had thousands of white people (even poor white people) been affected government bureaucrats callously allowed to thousands of black people to get sick and die. Both of these examples powerfully demonstrate, for all the world to see, the very real and deep rooted societal inequality (an inequality that is fundamental and built into our institutions) that exists between white, black, rich and poor in much the same way that the freedom riders displayed such hypocrisy during the civil rights movement did. These are but two examples of modern day environmental racism there are many many more that don't receive national attention and that most of the public is completely unaware of. I hope that answers your question:) ",
