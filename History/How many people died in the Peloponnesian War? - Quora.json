            "answer_text": "27 years of war, encompassing the whole of Greece, the Aegean and Ionian seas, the coast of Asia minor (called Ionia) and up into the Bosporus to protect the black Sea trade routes. How could we even begin to calculate the deaths from battle. There were literally thousands, if not tens of thousands of engagements during the war (read thucydides, it will give you an idea of the scale), let alone the atrocities that occurred from cities being stormed, plague and factional fighting within poleis (plural for Greek city state) as democrats and oligarchs sought to destroy each other internally. Put it this way. It was the biggest cluster fuck that had ever occurred in Western history, and we simply don't have the sources to guess at the numbers. ",

The Syracuse Expedition alone cost Athens some 50,000 men or however many went to Syracuse. Athens lost some one-third of its population in the plague. 250,000 would be my wild guess for all sides.
