            "answer_text": "Assuming you mean written histories, the biggest of \u2018disadvantages\u2019 can be summed up by Churchill\u2019s words: \u201cHistory is written by the victors.\u201d There is always a received view of history that it is the study of facts about the past, but few realize that it is more about the lenses through which we put that past into perspective, how we interpret it and how we regard it as something of significance to us (or disregard it). If you\u2019re up for some really outrageous reading, I\u2019d suggest Robert Orme\u2019s \u2018The Effeminacy of the Inhabitants of Indostan.\u2019 That should provide ample (and unspeakable) examples of this. It\u2019s why we have different philosophies of historical enquiry - nationalist histories, economic histories, social histories etc. The difference is not only in the themes but also in the interpretation, e.g. the great debate over Emperor Aurangzeb (put blandly: scoundrel or saint?). Events of our pasts are interpreted in different ways to suit different needs. And then there\u2019s the most obvious issue of debatable accuracy. What often happens is that history merges with folklore and popular myth and legend, and the reality is lost in-between - take, for example, King Arthur, or Jacques de Molay, or the much debated Queen Padmavati.
