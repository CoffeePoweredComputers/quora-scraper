            "answer_text": "The Abbassid Caliphate might have trickled along for a few more generations, but by then it was, and had been for centuries, simply a symbolic institution shorn of all real power. Baghdad itself was on the downward slope of centuries of decline, but it housed libraries containing many rare tomes of both Islamic and Greco-Roman classics lost to the West by then.  All of that knowledge went up in flames, and many books were forever lost to mankind.  One of my personal favorites, Livy's History of Rome, survives today only in truncated form, with roughly half the books missing. Baghdad's role as the intellectual and cultural center of Islam was also gone.  The city had housed various universities, with a thriving scholarly and and cultural scene, full of intellectual ferment and relative openness.  It served as a counterweight to an emerging reactionary strain of conservatism in Islam, epitomized by the anti rationalism of Al-Ghazali .  With Baghdad in ruins, the conservative strain won out in Islam, with dire consequences for the future of the Islamic world. ",
