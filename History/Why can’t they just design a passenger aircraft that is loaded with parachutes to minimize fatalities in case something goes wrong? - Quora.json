            "answer_text": "Assuming you refer to typical passenger aircraft carrying from perhaps 200 to over 400 passengers, the brief answer is- it just wouldn\u2019t work. To save space & time, here\u2019s a list of reasons: Most crashes occur close to takeoff or landing; the altitude of aircraft near the airport is simply too low for a parachute to open. 2. Aircraft are designed to discharge all passengers within 90 seconds, while the aircraft is on the ground, not in the air. Achieving this in flight would be most unlikely. 3. The survivable use of parachutes requires training, it is also unlikely to have the majority of passewngers on a typical flight to have any training in the use of parachutes; this lack of training would cause delays in having passengers not only put the chutes on, but follow directions re exiting the aircraft, and so on; most likely at that point the aircraft would have crashed long before an appreciable number of passengers had been able to jump out successfully, if at all, PLUS\u2026 4. remember that modern jet aircrfaft fly at very high speeds, nearly 600 mph, but even if flying very slowly, something like 150 MPH or more, this means that any attempt to exit the aircraft in tornado-intensity winds would almost certainly not be successful\u2026 5. most commercial long distance flights cruise at 30,000~40,000 feet or so, where there\u2019s not enough oxygen to survive without supplemental oxygen, like a mountain climber; also to exit the aircraft the doors would have to be open (somehow!) which means everyone in the aircraft not on oxygen would pass out very, very quickly as well, within a few seconds, and so would be unable to get anywhere near an exit, and so on. For these and many other reasons, aircraft are designed to be as safely built with as many redundant control systems as possible, to give the crew the best possible chance of saving the aircraft, passengers and crew in an emergency. All in all unless you plan on becoming a military pilot flying fighter aircraft, I\u2019d forget about using a parachute to jump from a commercial flight to get back to ground safely. Leave your chances to the pilots, who have extensive training in making everything turn out well!",

            "answer_text": "Parachutes are much more dangerous than airplanes. Back in the 1920s or 1930s, someone did a study on this. The conclusion was that it was so much safer to stay with the aircraft, even if it was going to crash or was burning, that the parachutes were going to cause more problems than they solved. Modern airliners are pressurised, which makes jumping impossible anyway: you can\u2019t open the doors in flight. Further, jumping from an aircraft at over 30,000 ft is very difficult because you can\u2019t stay conscious at that air pressure. So how do you get all the jumpers to an exit and out? Military jumpers solve this one with oxygen for the jumpers\u2026 but that takes training to use. Now, some small airplanes use a parachute that will gently land the whole airplane. That makes a certain amount of sense for a single-engine airplane that might be flying at night or in low visibility, where making a successful emergency landing is basically impossible. But those systems are somewhat controversial, because the safety argument is not totally compelling. But for a large multi-engine aircraft, it is much safer to stay with the airplane. ",
