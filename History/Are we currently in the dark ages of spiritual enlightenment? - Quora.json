            "answer_text": "In 2012 the fear of the world ending, surrounding the Mayan calender was a misrepresentation of its real meaning, which was that we are in a new planetary spiritual dimension, known as 4th density. This is, in part, why the planet is heating up. Why there is seemingly a heightened polarization between those of a self serving mentality and those who are in service to others. And also why there is a population boon. There will be in the years to come, much societal, governmental and global turmoil, as these changes take place. Extreme weather, the devaluing of the importance of money, status and power. And a shift in the consciousness of individuals across the planet. But I can see why it seems there is a vacancy of inherent good, but just like when an overweight person decides to be healthy. They must go through the painful transition of changing their food intake to healthier choices, while abstaining from favored meals. Sweating through the endless painful exercises to realize their better way being. Some must go through a long and arduous brutally painful divorce so they can then attain better more fulfilling relationships. So find the peace within and be a part of the shift toward higher consciousness. L&L ",

We are at the dawn of a new and wonderful age in which we humans use more of our potential. There are more \u201cenlightened\u201d people on earth right now than ever. To be enlightened is to see through life\u2019s apparent dualities\u2014good, bad/rich, poor/happy, sad/living, dead\u2014and realize they exist for a reason and that nothing\u2019s actually wrong. Life is a kind of school full of opportunities for growth. We are all perfectly safe and meant to be happy. We\u2019re in a transitional period in which we\u2019re learning to exercise our free will better through its true source\u2014our powerful minds. Even at this moment our minds are shaping our collective and personal realities. In short, if you think you\u2019re in a dark spiritual age then you are. If you don\u2019t think that then you\u2019re not. It\u2019s up to you. ",

The only thing holding us back now is our faulty right brain that generates anxiety and wastes energy, this fights its own recognition and corrective treatment as it has blocked natural selection but the truth will be told and science will take us into the age of true human enlightenment.
