            "answer_text": "Although some slaves did rise up in violent revolts against their enslavement, those incidences did not go very far and legal slavery was not outlawed until 1865, following the end of the war between the states. We must look back and see that everything possible was done to subjugate slaves, from the moment of capture to death. Even the Bible that was read to slaves to aid in cowing them, was altered to appear as if God put his stamp of approval on African-Americans having life on earth only to serve as slaves. They were forbidden to touch weapons. They were forbidden to learn to read. All that they heard from birth onward, was that their lot in life was to serve Whites as slaves and that they could never be equal to Whites. The idea that their position in life was to live as cattle, in the best way that they could, to serve in a docile manner, without any thought toward being free. If they even heard of the Emancipation in 1865, they were treated no differently afterward. Many who had been slaves, stayed in the same \u201cslave quarters\u201d where their people had lived for decades. They had been denied any skills outside of what they needed to know to work. That usually only encompassed farm work and they learned no skills that would have helped them get work in northern cities. Therefore, in many cases, they stayed put, following emancipation. My own maternal grandmother, who\u2019s family had worked a Frederick, Md. family farm all her life was proud to tell me when I was very small; \u201cAt the end of the War, none of Grand Pa\u2019s darkies left him. They stayed and worked the farm!\u201d I did not realize until much later, that those freed Blacks did not have much choice. I believe that they were treated relatively well, as far as that goes, when one is in bondage. But when freed, what could they do to take care of themselves and their families? Grand Pa told them that as long as they stayed on the farm and worked for him, they\u2019d have a roof over their heads, clothes and food to eat and a bit of cash to spend. For many that appeared to be as good as it got! For Grand Pa, his \u201cdarkies\u201d were better off staying on his farm and he likely viewed himself as a very Godly man. I know that my grandmother viewed him in that light. She seemed to only have a kindly attitude toward those she tried hard to respect, in her own way. Even referring to African-Americans as \u201cNigras\u201d in a soft voice, instead of the harsher forms of how whites referred to African-Americans in that day. Grandmother\u2019s racism was a somewhat benevolent position of recognizing those \u201cNigras\u201d who worked hard for white people, as being decent and \u201call most human\u201d. She would be very hurt to have been accused of being a racist. My grandparents had a store and so, employed a full time African-American lady to tend the house and raise their two girls. \u201cMolly\u201d was the only way I ever heard that the entire family referred to the lady. Grandmother made quite a big deal out of how she and my grandfather drove to the area where Molly lived to view her in death, at the segregated funeral parlor. Grandmother was proud to have been the only white family who went to \u201csee\u201d Molly and how the \u201cdarkies\u201d all thanked her and the family for showing up. Again that generation of my family did not lynch any black folks, but they took part in carrying on keeping black folks down, even though they consciously never thought about that. The household in which Molly worked was not like that shown in the film, \u201cThe Help\u201d. Molly ate the same food at the same table, when the family ate. There was only one bathroom in the house and, of course, Molly used it. Even my grandfather had to come up to the bathroom in the house when needed, as there was no bathroom in the basement store. I do feel good about the way in which Molly was treated, even though she could have never gained total equality with the family, she did have respect from them, as a good employee and not as an inferior being. Both my mother and her sister, whom Molly raised, always spoke kindly of Molly. I write this as I was disturbed in watching \u201cThe Help\u201d and I want others to know that during that same period of time, all African-Americans who worked in White homes were not treated as shabbily as was shown in that film. Of course, there was intimidation by many Whites, especially further south. But also there were kinder masters, who while they did profit from slavery, treated their slaves well enough, that given what the slaves could have known, was \u201cnot too bad\u201d! I am only stating what I have learned and in no way am I being an apologist for slavery. For the most part, while slavery was legal and widespread, the African-Americans seldom had anything to motivate them to escape what had been drilled into their heads as the normal course of things. They were slaves and as far as they could see, there was no other life to run to. In the post war days, for many African-Americans who were \u201cliberated\u201d by law, nothing changed. ",

            "answer_text": "Jim Crow laws came from the North. Primary sources reflecting Southern attitudes on race, slavery, and the war: The prejudice of the race appears to be stronger in the States which have abolished slavery than in those where it still exists. In the South, where slavery still exists, the negroes are less carefully kept apart; they sometimes share the labor and the recreations of the whites; the whites consent to intermix with them. The habits of the Southern people are more tolerant and compassionate.\u201d Alexis de Tocqueville, French Aristocrat who toured the US in 1831. \u201cI am struck with the close cohabitation and association of black and white. Negro women are carrying black and white babies together in their arms; black and white children are playing together. They all talked and laughed together; and the girls munched confectionary out of the same paper, with a familiarity and closeness of intimacy that would have been noticed with astonishment, if not manifest displeasure, in almost any chance company of the North.\u201d Frederick Olmsted, Northern architect and travel writer. \u201cSoutherners have African attendants, African playmates, African recreations, African voices, African minds.\u201d Thomas Goodwin, Northern literary author. \u201cI have no prejudice against the Southern people. They are just what we would be in their situation. If slavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it. If it did now exist among us, we should not instantly give it up. This I believe of the masses of the North and the South. When Southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we, acknowledge the fact. When it is said the institution exists, and it is very difficult to get rid of it in any satisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying. I surely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do myself.\u201d Abraham Lincoln, 1858, in a rare moment of honesty pointing out that Southerners did not want slavery either and acknowledging the difficulty of ending it. Later he would reverse himself when he played the slavery card. \u201cThere are few I believe in this enlightened age, who will not acknowledge that slavery is a moral and political evil. While we see the course of the final abolition of human slavery is still onward, and give it the aid of our prayers, let us leave the progress as well as the results in the hands of Him who, chooses to work by slow influences, and with whom a thousand years be but as a single day.\u201d Robert E. Lee, 1856. \u201cThe best men in the South have long desired to do away with the institution of slavery, and were quite willing to see it abolished. But, unless some humane course, based on wisdom and Christian principles, was adopted, you do them great injustice in setting them free.\u201d Robert E. Lee, explaining that abolition must be done humanly and not unplanned (as occurred causing mass deaths among the displaced freedmen.) \u201cIt is said slavery is all we are fighting for, and if we give it up, we give up all. Even If this were true, which we deny, slavery is not all our enemies are fighting for. It is merely the pretense to establish sectional superiority and a more centralized form of government, and to deprive us of our rights and liberties.\u201d Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne, 1864. \u201cWar was not necessary to the abolition of slavery. Years before the agitation began at the North and the menacing acts to the institution, there was a growing feeling all over the South for its abolition. Slavery could have been blotted out without the sacrifice of brave men.\u201d Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy. \u201cAs for the South, it is enough to say that perhaps eighty percent of her armies were neither slave-holders, nor had the remotest interest in the institution. No other proof, however, is needed than the undeniable fact that at any period of the war from its beginning to near its close, the South could have saved slavery by simply laying down its arms and returning to the Union.\u201d Lt. Gen. John B. Gordon. \u201cAnd to you, our colored friends we say welcome. We can never forget your faithfulness in the darkest hours of our lives. We tender to you our hearty respect and love, for you never faltered in you duty nor betrayed your trust.\u201d Col. William Sanford at a Confederate veterans reunion 9/22/1876. \u201cSlavery is for its end the preparation of that race for civil liberty and social enjoyment\u2026 When the time shall arrive at which emancipation is proper, those most interested will be most anxious to effect it.\u201d Jefferson Davis, prior to secession upon the floor of the US Senate. Dr. C. Vann Woodward, former Professor of History at Yale, points out the following comparison between the Radical Republicans during Reconstruction and the old former slave owners: Regarding the Left leaning Radical Republicans whom he calls \u201cfalse friends of the freedmen:\u201d \u201cThey were false friends not only because of an error of judgement but also out of baseness of motive; for they had used their pretended friendship to advance selfish ends of party advantage and private gain.\u201d Regarding the old slave owners after the war Woodward quotes the following 1879 editorial: \u201cThe old slave owner feels no social fear of negro equality... He feels no desire to maltreat and brow-beat and spit upon the colored man. He feels no opposition to the education and elevation of the black man in the scale of civilized life.\u201d (The Strange Career of Jim Crow, p. 48, 49) Of relevance is the fact that Confederate V.P. Alexander Stephens paid the college tuition of one of his former slaves.  Woodward represents yet another refutation of the mythical pejorative \u201cLost Cause School.\u201d The claims of benevolent masters and good race relations in the antebellum South was NOT a Lost Cause myth. It was witnessed reality, and carried over into the post-Reconstruction years in spite of efforts by the Radical Republicans to destroy race relations in the South. As long as the old antebellum Southerners were alive, the detrimental introduction of the Northern Black Codes into the South were to a large degree restrained. Part 2: I am currently taking another look at a book I had read years ago. C. Vann Woodward, Professor of History at Yale, wrote THE STRANGE CAREER OF JIM CROW, a series of lectures he delivered in 1954. The first thing that strikes me is how honest and frank he was able to be at a time before the PC thought police overran our institutions of higher learning! He could not write the same book today without jeopardizing his career as a professional historian. The holier-than-thou would not permit such credible history to expose their false narrative. In a prior post on my current re-read, I pointed out some interesting comments he made about Reconstruction. Perhaps the most important takeaway from that topic is his frank admission that, \u201cOne of the strangest things about the career of Jim Crow was that the system was born in the North and reached an advanced age before moving South in force.\u201d He points out that its first introduction in the South came at the hands of the provisional Reconstruction governments. Tonight I re-read chapter two. He deals with the period in the South after Northern troops pulled out in 1877. Here are some fascinating takes: He first mentions a couple of writers, one from the North and the other British, who toured the South to see how blacks were now being treated. In 1878 Northerner (former militant abolitionist) Col. Thomas Higginson, a writer for the Atlantic Monthly, toured three Southern States expecting to find the blacks horribly treated with the absence of Federal troops. Higginson was quite surprised by what he found. \u201cHe compared the tolerance and acceptance of the Negro in the South... with attitudes in his native New England and decided that the South came off rather better in comparison.\u201d It was better \u201cin granting rights and privileges to the colored race.\u201d In 1789 Parliamentarian Sir George Campbell traveled a large part of the South to study race relations. \u201cHe was impressed with the freedom of association between whites and blacks, with the frequency and intimacy of personal contact, and with the extent of Negro participation in political affairs...\u2019on terms of perfect equality, and without the smallest symptom of malice or dislike on either side.\u2019\u201d Woodward presents testimony after testimony of others experiencing the same racial harmony. One black Boston newspaper writer states, \u201cI think the whites of the South are really less afraid to have contact with colored people than whites of the North... I can be more politely waited on than in some parts of New England.\u201d Woodward also reveals two former Confederate soldiers who wrote books during 1885 and 1889 calling for the equal treatment of all their black neighbors, one stating, \u201cIn all things and in all places he (blacks) must, unless we wish to clip his hope and crush his self-respect, be treated precisely like the whites, no better, but no worse.\u201d Woodward adds, \u201cA frequent topic of comment by Northern visitors was the intimacy of contact between the races in the South, an intimacy sometimes admitted to be distasteful to the visitor... white babies suckled at black breasts, white and colored children playing together, the casual proximity of white and Negro homes... The same sights and stories had once been topics of comment for carpetbaggers and before them abolitionists, both of whom expressed puzzlement and sometimes revulsion.\u201d Then Woodward concludes with the following frank admission: (emphasis mine) \u201cWHAT THE NORTHERN TRAVELER OF THE \u2018EIGHTIES TOOK FOR SIGNS OF A NEW ERA OF RACE RELATIONS WAS REALLY A HERITAGE OF SLAVERY TIMES, OR, MORE ELEMENTALLY, THE RESULT OF TWO PEOPLES HAVING LIVED TOGETHER INTIMATELY FOR A LONG TIME...\u201d Indeed once the yankees had given up on Reconstruction and left, race relations returned to the more harmonious norm that characterized the South before Lincoln\u2019s war and subsequent Reconstruction. As long as the old antebellum Southerners were still alive, those egregious Northern Black codes introduced during the war and Reconstruction would be held at bay by a heritage of caring for all men regardless of color. A heritage rooted in a Christian ethic that permeated Southern culture. One can only imagine how much better race relations would have been in the long run without Northern interference in the South. There is no way Woodward would be allowed to expose these historical truths today, because they do not fit the Righteous Cause narrative, or the Marxist style analysis that needs victimization as leverage for Leftist political power. The PC thought police would destroy him. The Slaves who survived the transition to freedom learned Southerners were more concerned with their welfare that Yankees. The Pious Cause Narrative claims the North\u2019s anti-slavery was motivated by a moral humanitarian concern for the black race. Hear the words of the movers and shakers in the antebellum North: \u201cBy God, sir, men born and nursed of white women are not going to be ruled by men who were brought up on the milk of some damn Negro wench!\u201d Congressman David Wilmont of Pennsylvania. Famous for the Wilmont Proviso. \u201cThe dark man, the black man declines, it will happen by and by that the black man will only be destined for museums like the DoDo.\u201d Ralph Waldo Emerson, Northern writer, abolitionist, and humanitarian. Expressing his desire that blacks \u201cdie out.\u201d \u201cSoutherners have retarded progress because of the direct influence of so large a population of half barbarous Africans interspersed among them, GT and who had instructed them in the structures and principles of African despotism.\u201d Thomas Goodwin, Northern author and abolitionist. \u201cI\u2019ve heard you have abolitionists here, we have a few in Illinois and we shot one the other day.\u201d Abraham Lincoln, 9/1848. Spoken in a jocular tone revealing his disdain for abolitionists. \u201cCanada is just to our North, and offers a fine market for wool.\u201d Gov of Conn. William Alfred Buckingham. His response to the need to take in black war contrabands. \u201cThere is in the great masses of the people a natural and proper loathing of the negro, which forbids contact with him as with a leper.\u201d Chicago Times. \u201cConfine the negro to the smallest possible area, hem him in, coup him up, sloth him off, preserve just so much of North America as it possible for the white man and to free institutions.\u201c The Atlantic Monthly. \u201cI went through the State of Illinois for the purpose of getting signers to a petition, asking the Legislature to repeal the Testimony Law, so as to permit colored men to testify against white men. I went to prominent Republicans, and among others to Abraham Lincoln and Lyman Trumbull, and neither of them dared to sign that petition to give me the right to testify in a court of justice! If we sent our children to school, Abraham Lincoln would kick them out, in the name of Republicanism and anti-slavery!\u2026 I care nothing about that anti-slavery which wants to make the Territories free, while it is unwilling to extend to me, as a man, in the free States, all the rights of a man.\u201d H. Ford Douglas, free negro abolitionist in Chicago, Illinois. \u201cThe white man needs this continent to labor upon. His head is clear, his arm is strong, and his necessities are fixed. He must and will have it. To secure it, he will oblige the Government of the United States to abandon intervention in favor of slave labor and slave States, and go backward forty years, and resume the original policy of intervention in favor of free labor and free States... Mr. President, this expansion of the empire of free white men is to be conducted through the process of admitting new States, and not other- wise. The white man, whether you consent or not, will make the States to be admitted, and he will make them all free States. Sec of State William Seward, Speech before the US Senate 3/3/1858. \u201cThe negro is a foreign and feeble element like the Indians, incapable of assimilation, a pitiful exotic unnecessarily and unwisely transplanted into our field, and which it is unprofitable to cultivate at the cost of the desolation of the native vineyard.\u201d William Seward, in a speech at an 1860 political rally. \u201cIn the State where I live we do not like Negroes. We do not disguise our dislike. As my friend from Indiana (Mr. Wright) said yesterday, \u2018The whole people of the Northwestern States are, for reasons, whether correct or not, opposed to having many Negroes among them, and that principle or prejudice has been engraved in the legislation of nearly all the Northwestern States.\u2019 \u201c Ohio Senator John Sherman, on April 2, 1862. \u201cKeeping slaves out of the West will confine the negro to the South.\u201d Abolitionist Charles Elliot of Massachusetts. This is just a sampling of Northern quotes, revealing that \u201canti-slavery\u201d in the North meant \u201canti-black.\u201d A neutral anti-slavery Englishman you may have heard of had this to say about Northern \u201canti-slavery\u201d - \u201cI take the facts of the American quarrel to stand thus. Slavery has in reality nothing on earth to do with it\u2026that the North hates the negro, and until it was convenient to make a pretense that sympathy with him was the cause of the war, it hated the Abolitionists and derided them up hill and down dale.\u201d Charles Dickens, 1862.

            "answer_text": "There were, as another answer has noted, at least 250 slave revolts in what is now the US. There were also some revolts in French Louisiana. Keep in mind that an actual revolt was dangerous and apt to result in death. Executions were often cruel, aimed at intimidating resistance. Individual people could, and did, revolt by sabotaging tools, pretending to be stupid, escaping into the woods or heading for Canada, Florida (when it was Spanish) or Mexico. Over the years, tens of thousands escaped. A considerable number of slaves escaped and passed for white and vanished into the general population. There were a few maroon groups of escaped slaves in remote places like the Dismal Swamp. Others joined remote mixed-race communities, and many escaped to the risky situation of joining some Indian group. A problem with revolts in the US was that slaves were closely supervised, and that the largest slaveholders had hundreds of slaves, not the thousands often held elsewhere. In vast estates, slaves had a kind of anonymity of numbers. In the South, that was rare. Slaves were also substantially outnumbered, unlike Haiti where slaves outnumbered whites and free Blacks by none or ten to one. Slaves in the US were usually bought in mixed lots so that ten new slaves might have ten different languages or dialects. That forced them to learn English to communicate with each other, which made the secrecy provided by language slaveholders could not understand. Slaves were generally forbidden to learn to read and write. That way they could not forge passes, or communicate by letter. The Southern countryside was routinely and frequently criss-crossed by armed patrols deeply suspicious of any Black person away from their homes. After slavery formally ended, in much of the South white supremacy was propped up by extreme violence. Would-be leaders and others were sometimes driven away, warned or murdered. If you add up the totals of massacres and riots and lynchings, the number of Black people killed is probably somewhere around 10,000. Institutionalized terror is effective against revolts. ",

There is documented evidence of more than 250 uprisings or attempted uprisings involving 10 or more slaves. Three of the best known in the United States during the 19th century are the revolts by Gabriel Prosser in the Richmond, Virginia area in 1800, Denmark Vesey in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1822, and Nat Turner in Southampton County, Virginia, in 1831. (Emphasis mine.) Slave resistance in the antebellum South did not gain the attention of academic historians until the 1940s, when historian Herbert Aptheker started publishing the first serious scholarly work on the subject. Aptheker stressed how rebellions were rooted in the exploitative conditions of the southern slave system. He traversed libraries and archives throughout the South, managing to uncover roughly 250 similar instances. From Wikipedia: Slave rebellion - Wikipedia ",
