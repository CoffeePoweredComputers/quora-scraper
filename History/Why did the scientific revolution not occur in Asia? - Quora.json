            "answer_text": "The simple fact is that it did, several times. The main difference is that it was sustained for several centuries in the West but for much shorter times in the East. it is also important to see that Science is only one aspect of a general enlightenment. if enlightenment dies, Science quickly follows. One prime example was the Josean dynasty in Korea, that led to an explosion of art, science and technology in Korea from 1400. It did not fail due to oppression by the Korean rulers, but because its success generated fear and jealousy in neighbouring states. Korea was subjected to a series of invasions whose primary purpose was to weaken Korea, and they succeeded. As Islam advanced across the world it triggered a series of scientific explosions in Arabia, Persia and Mughal India. Europe was taught the scientific method by muslim scholars and jewish refugees from muslim oppression. The windmill, algebra, al-chemie, civil engineering and modern medicine are all based in Arabian science. Maimonides\u2019 ideas presage modern psychiatry. China had several explosions of science and art, all suppressed from the centre as the bureaucracy feared the open mindedness and critical thinking that are part and parcel of enlightenment. Why enlightenment persisted and grew in Europe is a matter for extensive debate, but perhaps we can learn something from the fact that it is slowly dying. Critical thought is under attack in America and in many countries across Europe. Scientific publications are now a source of profit for publishers rather than a source of reliable information for seekers. Religion is in decline. For all their faults, religions teach fundamental values of equality, truth and generosity that are part of the foundations of any enlightenment. The flow of information has been disrupted. We don\u2019t just need to understand why, we need to act. We need to treasure the conditions underpinning enlightenment, and hold the line against those forces that seek to destroy it. ",

            "answer_text": "Algebra as an instrument. We are all learn math. We do it in school. Then we learn basics of algebra, which (and this is our childhood) use constants, variables, parenthesis and math symbols. It did not happened before Viete. Having symbolic algebra we can rethink physics. And having physics - rethink nearly everything. But before Viete, operations were explained. In Asia, operations were explained for much longer time. Measurements as science: not just explain phenomena. Measure it, and provide relations between measured values. Competition: we need a competition, so those countries, which introduce engineering approach, could defeat and (cut throat) substitute elites of backward. Then introduce their own who are educated properly, (or educate local elites). In 1866 a Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz - Wikipedia took place. As a resume, Oscar Peshel told \u201cIt was a victory of a Prussian School Teacher over Austrian School Teacher\u201d. But before that took place, we see how advanced Englishmen (several thousand) defeated China. (But no one left any adores to British Public Schools, or even understood their role). In a middle XIX achievements of science and engineering, since engineering is based on physics, physics in based on symbolic algebra, and it is an advanced math like statistics or analytical math which are impossible without symbolic representation and manipulations with symbols. Asia. What Asia? If they a proud of their \u201cRight Hemisphere Mind\u201d , how they could think in a way, that just a 11 years old boy or girl in Europe could? If they use symbols in a totally different way, being mature, but mathematically illiterate? Asian culture was a burden. Its defeat was programmed in their culture, and mindset. That is why Comrade Mao introduced Cultural Revolution (in some scale and in other regions, it already happen in some Asian countries, but not in China): he understood, that classical scholar tradition is not compatible with principles, how engineers think. So, they changed something in brains. When they already tested bomb (1964) they understood, that it is simply a different pattern of thinking. It must be introduced everywhere (hurry up!) and, actually, destroyed a lot of things (after 1966). They (Asians) boys and girls are very strong in math now. It was nearly impossible just a century ago. They changed. But then we see how this principles of thinking changed modern China (after Taiwan, Japan, South Korea) and Vietnam after China. (BTW: if you understand me properly - modern industry is based on computers, and programming which are sequences of instructions, developed from Algebra. ) ",
