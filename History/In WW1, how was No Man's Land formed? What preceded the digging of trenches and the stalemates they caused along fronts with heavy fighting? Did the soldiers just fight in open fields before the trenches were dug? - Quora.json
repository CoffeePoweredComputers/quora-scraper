            "answer_text": "The trenches were the result of the stalemate, not the cause of it. No Man\u2019s Land was simply the area between the trench lines. Thinking dynamically helps understand how it happened. Both sides were enamored with the offensive, but neither had invested in the kind of forces needed to sustain offenses. As a result, neither side was able to generate and sustain (logistically) the dominant mobile forces necessary at the operational level to continue indefinitely a large scale, decisive offensive operation and each success was limited to the speed and depth of its logistics and supporting fires. All advantage was local and temporary, doomed to stall sooner than later. With each passing week on the defensive, more supplies and ammunition came forward and was dropped on the ground, the guns dug in, the ground got more untrafficable, and it became harder and harder to start moving forward again. The machine gun and artillery barrages produced a cruel calculus that decimated the strongest attacks before they could move far enough and long enough to break through the defensive belts they faced. Survival required digging deep enough to stay out of direct fire and survive indirect fire. Local stalemate spread across the ever extending front as attempts to outflank the opponent and find open ground failed on both sides. The advent of the \u201ctank\u201d that combined survivability and mobility promised to change the calculus, but it could not change without the advanced operational thinking and improved mobility of fires and logistics across the force that would enable \u201cBlitz\u201d and mission-focused \u201dAuftragstaktik\u201d warfare to prosper just 20\u201325 years later using armored forces and motorized logistics. These forces combined to deliver designed-in mobility, protection and firepower when they emerged from the Ardennes Forest, opened gaps in the defensive fortification lines and flooded through supplies, fuel and troops, supported by tactical air attacks. Improved communications gave them agility of both maneuver and logistics elements. Their mobility forced the defenders to fight in depth against smaller attacking elements and prevented the defenders from repairing the forward edge of the defensive area and achieving sufficient economy of force to attrite the isolated attackers in their depth.

            "answer_text": "All sides in Wolrd War One considered speed to be the key to victory. Both sides had only enough ammunition for three months. A direct result was that after three months, neither side could engage in large offensive operations. So both sides began to dig in while waiting for more ammunition. Of course, there was a considerable distance between the two front lines as both sides could still fire off the occasional hail of bullets or artillery shells. With no ammunition arriving soon and Winter setting in early, the trenches on both sides were turned into winter quarters. Before trench warfare set in, both sides were indeed fighting mainly in the open. Cavalry was used as reconnaissance and troops on the march would engage the enemy wherever an opportunity presented itself. For the Germans these were mainly offensive operations, for the Belgians, British, and French defensive operations. Once ammunition became plentiful, all firepower was concentrated along the front lines which were pretty straight. This massive amount of firepower made it nearly impossible to capture ground without enormous losses. ",
