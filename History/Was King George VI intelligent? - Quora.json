            "answer_text": "Speaking from an academic perspective, he wouldn\u2019t have been considered a scholar or intellectual. During his schooling years at the Royal Navy College, Osborne he graduated 68th out of 68th in his final examinations. However, I do recall reading in a book about him that his speech deficit had detrimentally contributed to his negative results. In class he would allegedly hesitate significantly when answering a question a class, which lead the teachers to believe he didn\u2019t know the answer. He did go on to attend Trinity Hall, Cambridge to study history, economics and civics for a year. I don\u2019t know what his grades were like there, but I don\u2019t doubt it would have been important considering he merely studied those subjects as they fit in with his royal duties more so than any academic ambitions.

            "answer_text": "King George VI would probably not have been considered an intellectual but he was by no means stupid. He had been considered slow as a child because of his stutter but he was of ordinary or better intelligence. What he really possessed was strength of character and empathy that stood his nation well during WW2. He also possessed a wife who supported and understood him and a country that respected him. ",
