            "answer_text": "Countries go into debt DURING a war in order to pay the cost of fighting the war - pay for the soldiers, purchase of weapoms and ammunition, food for soldiers, fuel for military vehicles, and so forth. Wars are expensive. After the war is over, countries often have had so much of their property (factories, etc.) destroyed that they don\u2019t have the income to pay back the debt. This is one of the reasons why wars are such a stupid way for people to resolve differences. Both sides in a war may end up impoverished. In ancient days, kings would borrow money and men to fight wars from the wealthy people in their countries and after the war, in order to repay them. would grant them things like land or titles because they had little else left. This is how things like knighthoods and earldoms originated and how the wealthy in any country would increase their political power. Just about any \u201caristocrat\u201d anywhere can trace their title to someone helping someone in a war. This is one of the reasons why the US constitution does not permit the president of the US to declare war - that must be done by the US congress. Some wars are started by poor people or countries who are already impoverished and have little to lose. Many revolutions start this way. Other countries that oppose the current regime or wealthy individuals whose interests are not well served by the current regime may provide money to help the revolutionaries, hoping both that the current regime will be defeated and that they themselves will end up with influence over the replacement government. Thus, for example, Russia has a lot of influence over Cuba, whose revolution was started by poor people and largely funded by the USSR (Russia\u2019s predecessor government). And in some South American countries, certain wealthy individuals have a lot of influence over regimes that came into being as the result of revolutions. The American revolution was greatly aided by France, which was fighting a war against England at the time and wanted the American colonies to distract England. It worked somewhat, but then the French revolution happened a few years later, so the old French regime did not have the influence on the US that it had hoped to have. Incidentally, the debt incurred in the American revolutiinary war is the start of the current US national debt. In the US, the \u201cLouisiana Purchase\u201d , by which the US purchased much of the French land to the west of the appalachian mountains, was how the US gave monty to Napoleon to help him fight his wars. But in this case it was not to have influence over him later on (and he ended up losing anyway). The US probably had to borrow to pay for it but by then the US was doing well and had the credibility to do so. Other wars are started ny very rich countries that have the ability to pay for them or the economic strength to borrow a lot of money and, for example, want to take land from others. Russia\u2019s recent takeover of Crimea from Ukraine is an example, as was much of the land taken from native Americans by the US. This is how many European countries once took over land in the Americas and in Africa. European colonies still exist today in many places around the world. England, for example, has colonies it took over from natives in such places as the Falkland Islands and Bermuda. ",

            "answer_text": "Wars are expensive. Apparently it is very rare for a government to be able to pay for a war from current income or savings. For one thing a significant fraction of the population is busy fighting the war. They are not producing value. Default and renegotiation of public debt is nearly as old and constant as public debt itself. During the Peloponnesian War the Athenians borrowed about 7,000 talents, or $2.6 billion dollars from the Treasury of Athena. Naturally they defaulted on the debt. ",
