            "answer_text": "That the \u201cself\u2019 or a \u201cbeing\u201d is fractal in nature. As S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard wrote in \u201cThe Sickness Unto Death:\u201d \u201cThe self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to its own self.\u201d I\u2019ve taken this into a more visual domain to communicate my current working definition of a self, and it looks something like this:  In this schematic, what I\u2019m labeling as SELF might be what Sigmund Freud referred to as the Ego, the \u201cI\u201d in the statement \u201cI am.\u201d The OTHER is another self which a being can be in a relationship with. The above visualization depicts multiple selves within one being. This may be difficult for some to grasp: the concept of there being another self besides \u201cI\u201d within our being. Perhaps it may be easier to conceive of this configuration in the expanded form: a marriage. This looks something like this:  As depicted in the schematic above, this form of being is self-similar (i.e. fractal) in configuration to the individual beings of which it\u2019s comprised. We have two individual beings, within a relationship, which compose a new being: a marriage. Expanded further, the Family can be visualized in the following way:  The above depicts how this configuration (in a simplistic form) demonstrates the same self-similarity. This pattern can continue to be expanded outward in networks of relationship, as well as inward when defining the other self (above labeled as SPIRIT, but could also be labeled as GOD). When considering the ramifications of an uncreated creator both indwelling our being, as well as connecting us within relationships to other beings and families, our \u201coneness\u201d beings to take on a very literal and awe-inspiring quality (to say the least). If you follow that rabbit hole, you may never come out of wonderland. ",
