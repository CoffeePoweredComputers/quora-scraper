            "answer_text": "I think most ancient philosophy, as well as religion, had as their primary purpose, answering the question: \"How do we know\". Later, as man became more knowledgeable about distinctions between \"supernatural\" and \"natural\" phenomena, science began to answer this question, and took over some of the problems that previously only religion and philosophy could answer.Unfortunately, in some cultures of today, most notably Indonesia and sub-Saharan African cultures, ancient animistic and supernatural practices still exist. Voodoo, for instance. And even more unfortunately, by labeling these primitive attempts to control environment, as the Left and all Leftist-leaning ideologies have done, as \"traditional\" religions, opportunity for advancement has been severely curtailed. One could almost say, that these cultures are being \"kept down\" by liberalism. ",
