            "answer_text": "Oh, no. Hitler's aim was to rid the world of all kinds of people that he decided should not live - and the Jews were the top priority. Had he not been defeated, he would have continued to murder all Jews in all lands the Nazis invaded. The Nazis actually drew up flow charts to determine who was a Jew and who wasn't, breaking \"partial Jews\" down into two sub-categories: first-degree mischlings and second-degree mischlings, depending on how many grandparents of the mischling were Jewish, and which ones. \"Mischling\" was a derogatory term meaning \"mixed\". While Jews were hunted down first, mischlings lost their rights and were absolutely in danger of losing their lives as well. Simply having one Jewish grandfather was enough to get you killed. Other target groups included: People with darker skin, although there were very few such people in Europe at the time. In fact, one Holocaust survivor told me that when he was liberated by the US troops, he awoke to find an African-American soldier standing over him, and he couldn't work out for a moment just what was going on. It was the first time in his life that he had ever seen someone whose skin wasn't white.People with disabilities - primarily intellectual, though no one was safe - except the Propaganda Minister, Josef Goebbles, who had a clubfoot, but was somehow exempt from extermination.Prisoners of war, but Soviet soldiers in particular.Roma and Sinti, or \"Gypsies\".Homosexuals, although the main aim here was \"social correction\" - they wanted to make gays straight. Until they became straight, they were imprisoned in the camps. I'm not sure just how they policed this, but this was not unusual in terms of warped and contradictory Nazi thinking.Poles, Slovaks, etc. who were considered \"sub-human\" - although again, Nazi ideology contradicted itself with the birth of the Lebensborn project - part of which included stealing Polish children from their biological families (if they were still young, and they had blonde hair and blue or green eyes), and fostering/adopting them out to Nazi families to \"Aryanise\" them. If Poles were truly sub-human due to their genetics, how could raising them in a different environment change that?Jehovah's Witnesses and others whose religion conflicted with Nazi ideology.The intelligentsia, not just because their intelligence was a threat, but so was their potential influence among the people, so they had to go.Political opponents.Anyone who was believed to be an \"enemy of the Reich\" such as priests who spoke out against the Nazis and their activities.I'm sure there are others I've forgotten (it's late here), but as you can see, there were a lot of people affected by Hitler's views regarding who deserved to live, and who didn't. Had the Nazis not been defeated, Hitler made it quite clear that it was his intention to continue on with what he had already been doing until such point as he had conquered the world. Those who were not murdered immediately were intended to be kept as slave labour for the \"ubermenchen\" - the \"superior\" \"Aryan\" people. Yes, he most definitely would have kept up the mass murder. ",

            "answer_text": "In a totalitarian ideology, the inability for anyone to create their own identities, to make informed judgements about reality, to freely act within the bounds of a stabilising legal framework or to enter into discourse in order to make political judgements from a representative standpoint means that, ultimately, totalitarianism is a saturnine chimera which would most likely devour itself, but at a cost to humanity which would be unthinkable.  Its appearance in the twentieth century was unpredictable, and its actions incredible. Its contradictory nature, in that it itself is a product of human unpredictability which sought to destroy that very same unpredictable \"human\" part of mankind, is perplexing. In this contradiction, totalitarianism, like tyranny, perhaps holds within itself the seeds of its own destruction.  The Nazi ideology needed an 'other', as others have noted, the Jews were not the only group targeted, and had it continued, new groups would have been found to persecute. Eventually, they would have run out of \"legitimate\" groups to target and turned on their own.  'If it is true that tyranny bears the germs of its own destruction because it is based upon powerlessness which is the negation of man's political condition, then, one is tempted to predict the downfall of totalitarian domination without outside interference, because it rests on the one human experience which is the negation of man's social condition. Yet [...] it would operate only after the full realization of totalitarian government which is possible only after the conquest of the earth'. Hannah Arendt, Ideology & Terror. ",
