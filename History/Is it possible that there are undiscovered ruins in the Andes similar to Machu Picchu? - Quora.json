            "answer_text": "I suppose it is possible, but unlikely. Keep in mind the term \"undiscovered\" is relative.  Locals were fully aware of the ruins (in fact a family lived in Machu Picchu when it was \"discovered\" by Hiram Bingham, who may have in fact not been the first European to identify the ruins). With the advent of satellite photography (and several decades worth of work looking for such ruins), I'm not going to say they've all been found (and I would doubt anyone who does) but, in my very amateur opinion, I believe the likelihood is small. Having said that, Peru has been a hotbed of archeological work over the past 30 to 40 years. The City of Caral, for example, was 'discovered' in the 90s and is stated to be in existence at the time of Ur in Mesopotamia. In other words, civilization has been in existence in South America far longer than most people realize and some exciting things are being found in the jungles of Brazil as well as in the coastal river valleys of Peru.

In fact it has already happened.Here's a link to some info on the ruins of Choquequirao, which are on a relatively close area and can be accessed on foot or mule-back. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choquequirao Now this all depends on what the scale of the \"similar to Machu Picchu\" ruins you're looking for is. Perhaps we won't find any that are on the same scale in terms of placement and craftsmanship . ",
