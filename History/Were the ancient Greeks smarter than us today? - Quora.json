            "answer_text": "I think a better question would be \"Are humans today smarter than our ancestors (including the Greeks, Romans, ancient Chinese, ancient Indians, et. al.)  My answer would be no, we aren't.We have a lot of technology today, because we keep adding to what we know.  Technological development is incremental- it grows by small improvements.  The first steam and internal combustion engines were little more than toys- but they proved the theory.  Both started out physically large, with very low efficiency and power/weight ratios.  But over time, both improved slowly but steadily.  So, people building steam locomotives in 1900 weren't smarter than the ones building them in 185o, and the people building them in 1950 weren't smarter than the people building them in 1900. Another point in favor of our ancestor's brains is the things we can prove scientifically that they did.  We can't even complain that we (folks born after 1900) invented the computer, or the computer program.  We know the Ancient Greeks made at least one mechanical computer, the Antikythera Mechanism:  Scientists Unravel Mystery of Ancient Greek Machine And Charles Babbage invented the programmable calculator and computer in the mid 18th Century, building on the work of Blaise Pascal (yeah, THAT Pascal) in the mid 17th Century.  Who Was Charles Babbage? Agusta Ada King (nee' Byron), Countess of Lovelace, was a brilliant mathematician.  She, in translating an Italian article on Babbage's work, wrote notes longer than the article, in which is to be found the first computer program.  (Yes, she was the daughter of George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron, better known as Lord Byron, the romantic poet.\"Modern\" ideas and technologies like money, laws, irrigation, pottery, etc. go back thousands of years.  The Greeks and Romans used wind and water power in some pretty heavy duty industrial applications (as did the ancient Chinese.)  Also, regardless of what methods they may have used, we know for a fact that our ancestors were able to cut HUGE rocks free from the bedrock, lift them, shape and carve them, move them long distances uphill, lift them onto the walls of structures, and fit them together with incredible precision.  A pre-Incan civilization was doing this with 200 ton stones- at an altitude of 3,900 meters/12,800 feet.  The Broken Meinhr of Er Grah (Brittany, France) is a 330 ton stone, 68 feet/21 m long, moved 7.5 miles/12.1 km and lifted to vertical almost 7,000 years ago.  The Ancient Egyptians were moving 1,000 ton stones by ship, and moving 800 ton stones hundreds of miles over land.  If you accept that the 1,500 ton stone foundation blocks at Baalbek, Lebanon are not only pre-Roman, but pre-Caananite, that's even more impressive.  And the \"fringe sites\" are trumpeting a find in Southern Siberia with 3,000 ton granite blocks.  If not a hoax, that would be incredible.  List of largest monoliths in the world ",
