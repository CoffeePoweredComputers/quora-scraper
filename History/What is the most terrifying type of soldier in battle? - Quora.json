            "answer_text": "Assault Troops that are well trained, experienced and well led. As I thought about it, I recognized that SpecOps are also a form of Assault Troops, very different than what most people would consider assault. But, different they are. Your avg SpecOps type goes through a lot of individual training\u2026 One \u2018\u2018operator\u201d probably spends more time training with weapons, alone, than an entire rifle squad put together \u2014 two squads. Schools galore, best equipment, years in the making and they\u2019re entire orientation is individual, small unit. BTW , I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll regret saying, I don\u2019t consider Rangers as SpecOps. Well trained, light infantry. They were used WWII as assault, and since they\u2019re resurrection during Vietnam, I\u2019m not sure how to classify\u2026 they do get some high speed training. It takes a lot of time, energy and money to train SpecOps. Operationally, they\u2019re used in quite a few, different tactical scenarios \u2014 raids, hostage, deep area and point reconnaissance, etc\u2026\u2026. but they\u2019re not used for conventional assault such as assaulting a company size, and up, prepared position. Losing a squad of \u201coperators\u201d in any situation, that\u2019s like a stock market crash. And no way to recoup your loses. Unfortunately, spent way too much time on a sub-unit type that I wanted to make sure gets mentioned. USMC, during the 40\u201350\u201360\u201370\u2019s, is an example of Assault Troops. Could look at some WWI footage and watch German Stormtroopers for another example. They were awesome. Early 1967 and we went through 5\u20136 months of extremely hard, difficult training \u2014 constantly challenged physically, mentally \u2026. I still remember being told over, and over\u2026 90% of you will be casualties. Our training was focused on offensive combat and the mentality for it. We were trained not to stop for our casualties, best thing we could do is take position so our casualties would be cared for. Our cadence, as we marched, K-I-L-L versus 1,2,3,4. We hardly trained for defensive combat\u2026. \u201cWe don\u2019t fight from holes, Army fights from holes\u201d. \u201cWe take ground, other people hold it\u201d. I couldn\u2019t help but chuckle some, after re-enlisting, and then being schooled on how to \u2018\u2018construct\u201d a fighting hole\u2026. the right way. I don\u2019t believe they truly understood our mission. My mentors would have rolled in their graves. Assault troops are well trained, fluid, exhibit an elan, confidence and an assurance, as they assault, that conveys to the defenders that they\u2019ll be taking that position \u2014 one way or another. And remember that they\u2019re somewhat indoctrinated that they\u2019ll be a casualty, sooner or later. You can\u2019t imagine our \u2018\u2018surprise\u201d when handed our .22 Matels that didn\u2019t work, jamming frequently and beyond anyone\u2019s expectations. I\u2019d hoped someone, someday would put a list together of all of the marine assaults in Northern I Corps. It\u2019d be a very long list. And to accomplish that wo reliable weapons, equipment\u2026\u2026 As a defender, I\u2019d be a little concerned. Marine Corps has moved on, over time, which is a shame since they were considered one of the best light infantry assault troops in the world. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm going to have to say child soldiers are the most frightening in combat, 8-12 year olds being the worst. These kids are usually drugged up, forced into whatever war their adults place them in, many have been sexually abused. No grown-up soldiers wants to kill children, even if they are trying to kill you. Netflix had an incredible movie called Beasts of No Nations, it was about how a young orphaned boy ends up as a child soldier. Most of the enemies of the free world haved used child soldiers in one capacity or another. A prime example is the unarmed child waves the Iranian military used against the Iraqis during that war. The Iranians used 10-13 year old boys to run forward of the main body to clear mines and other obstacles as well as being \u2018human shields' for rhe Iranian military during attacks. The Palestinians have used toddlers straped with explosives and set them against Israeli Soldiers. This happened 100s of times during the Vietnam War. The VC would strap grenades to small children and send them towards the American lines. I would say child soldiers are the most frightening in combat, because even the most combat hardened soldier will end up hesitant to shoot a child soldier. ",
