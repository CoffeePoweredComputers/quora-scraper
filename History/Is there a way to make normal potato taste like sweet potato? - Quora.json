My mom was having trouble with her potatoes sprouting or going bad before she cooked and ate them. So she decided to keep them in her refrigerator. Now, if you do this for a short time you might not notice a big difference. But after some russets were in the refrigerator for a week (maybe more), my mom came to visit and brought along the potatoes. I baked them, and at first I thought something was wrong with my oven thermostat or that I baked them too long. The potatoes were brown under the skin. It was strange, because I had never seen that amount or depth of brown potato flesh before when I made baked potatoes. They had an aroma somewhat like toasted white bread. Then, I tasted them. They were noticeably sweet. They were not the familiar starchy flavor I was used to. They weren\u2019t bad, but they weren\u2019t what I really wanted in a baked potato. I searched the Internet and found out that potatoes will start to convert starch to sugar when kept in a cold environment like a refrigerator. I see that this also increases the amount of acrylamide in them, so do this at your own risk. Storing food safely - potatoes ",
