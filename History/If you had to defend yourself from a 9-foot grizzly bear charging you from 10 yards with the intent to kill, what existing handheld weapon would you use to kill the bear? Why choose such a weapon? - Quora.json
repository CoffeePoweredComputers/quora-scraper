            "answer_text": "Do I have to use a weapon? Because bear spray seems to be proven to be more effective and easier to aim. Because if a bear is charging at me from 10 yards, I\u2019m pretty much screwed unless I already have a gun at the ready, and even then accurate shooting will be impeded by a surge of adrenalin and fecal matter. So if don\u2019t have bear spray, a short barreled high caliber revolver I might be able to use when the bear is already on top of me, but I really don\u2019t like the odds of such a situation. I\u2019m thinking that even something monstrous like .500 S&W wouldn\u2019t have that much immediate effect unless you had good shot placement, and it\u2019s more likely I\u2019d be struggling just to hit. Also, if a bear is currently mauling me, any shot I get off would be one handed, probably not with the most optimal of grips, so something huge with a big recoil might just lead to me dropping the damned thing when fired. My experience with handguns is close to zero, you see. I wonder if a taser would be of any use against a bear? Once again, I\u2019d be better off with bear spray. So would the bear. Win-win. ",

            "answer_text": "I have done a lot of bear hunting in the Pacific Northwest, they Canada, and in Alaska in my almost 70 years on this planet. I started at 16 years old and started bear hunting with my great uncle, who insisted that get a .44 mag as a backup gun to my 8mm Mauser. So I found a Ruger Blackhawk with a 7 1/2 in barrel he was happy with. Never had to use it against a bear, but the best advice he gave me was try and shoot it in the law and then run like hell! Bears are very protective of their paws and will take some time out to assess the damage, buying you some time. If you have ever seen even a medium sized bear in full charge downhill, it is something to behold, and they can cover an amazing amount of ground even thru heavy brush all too quickly! So if you miss with your rifle or something happens to it, you had better be able to deploy your handgun quickly and accurately. That is why I now carry a Ruger Super Redhawk Alaskan .454 Casual, because it is double action and a faster draw for me then the single action long barrel .44 mag. ",
