            "answer_text": "There is a myth that life in rural Britain was always good. This is not the case. It was presented in a highly sanitised way by artists of the day with people well dressed and with gardens fill of flowers. Often those pictured were wearing their Sunday best or provided clothes, the gardens would have been full of vegetables, herbs and probably some chickens and a pig if you were lucky. it was a difficult life where you were expected to work from dawn to dusk, your house was owned by the farmer and if you lost your job you also lost your house. This type of tenure existed in the UK until around the last third of the 20th century. If you lost your job you headed to town where the industrialists were looking for workers. There was housing, although some was overcrowded and poor, generally there were people willing to build more so the situation would improve. Many of the houses were well built and to the standards of the day. Many still stand and have adapted well to modern standards. As with all things challenges come through change. When you have a quickly developed urban area people cannot carry on as they did in the countryside and things like the removal of \u2018night soil\u2019 had to be arranged as well as the removal of other rubbish, the delivery of fuel, food etc to the workers who suddenly had (limited) spending power. While it may not be as you would expect it to be today, things were not that bad. You should not take films to be a realistic representation of reality. People then are the same as today, they had the same aims and desires, they did not want to live in squalor and did not. ",

            "answer_text": "Shortly b efore the industrial revolution there had been an agrigultural revolution started by a man named Jethro Tull who, for the record had no connection with a 1970s prog rock band. Tull invented a horse drawn seed drill, a similarly powered mowing machine, and machines that vastly reduced the manpower needed for tasks like lifting turnips and beet, baling hay and threshing corn. At the same time society was changing, from a peasant economy (small holders farming to mainly to feed their own families with a little over to sell for hard cash, to industrialised farming to meet the demand for food from rapidly growing urban communities. A wave of \u201cenclosures\u201d under an act passed in the reign of Elizabeth 1 which permitted landowners to take possession of what had for generrations been common land where peasants could graze cattle, sheep, goats and allow pigs to forage, simply by putting a fence round it and saying \u201cGet off my land,\u201d deprive the rural poor of a valuable source of food and income and rendered many unable to pay the rents demanded by lords of the manor. Thus many were forced off their land while others simply left for the towns to escape poverty, only to find themselves living in appalling conditions and working effectively as wage slaves, (under master and servant law an employee could not leave a job for something better without the factory owners permission. If people simply \u2018walked\u2019 they would not be given a reference without which they would have little chance of securing regular work. Merrie England was always a myth. ",
