            "answer_text": "Mankind has always tried to identify the best method of organizing themselves into productive, cohesive societies. The difficulty has been, and remains so, accounting for the disparity in talents and circumstances of each individual without resorting to violence. In other words, we employ \u201cpolitics\u201d as an alternative to killing each other. Countless ideologies have informed the establishment and operation of governments and societies throughout human history, but each of them can be appraised reliably using one simple filter - how does it account for the darker elements of human nature? There are only two sorts of people in this world: those who want to be let alone, to live as they choose, and those who simply cannot keep their hands to themselves. This distinction lies behind every ideological conflict in history. Those of the former sort believe in individual worth and sovereignty as preeminent values, subsequently choosing government structures that restrain the power of the state, while the latter variety try to shortcut human behavioral management by empowering the state (as representative of the collective) to order society in a \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cjust\u201d fashion. Those who prefer to restrain government recognize that mankind is not \u201cperfectible,\u201d and becomes more (not less) dangerous in groups while the more activist minded believe behavior to be a mere construct, subject to their \u201cperfecting\u201d influence. Who\u2019s definition of \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cjust\u201d shall be used? It is in dealing with those who believe differently from the state-approved notions that has resulted in collectivist ideologies killing more of their own people than even the most brutal dictatorships in the aggregate. There is no substitute for the concept of enlightened self-interest as a means of ordering society to its greatest potential. Only by hundreds of millions of individual choices being made daily can we offset the far fewer choices of those who are led by their darker impulses. An achievement no top-down centrally-planned government could possibly match. ",
