            "answer_text": "Things are a bit strange this year, though not unkown. Although Pitr Paksha will wrap on 17th September, 2020, thus the day will be celebrated as Mahalaya, which is the wrapping of Pitr Paksha and the beginning of auspicious Devi Paksha, however, Durga Puja will be celebrated almost a month after Mahalaya. Normally, Navratri starts just a day after Mahalaya, and Durga Puja starts just after five or six days. Note that this Sharadotsava is celebrated in Ashvin month. However, this time, there are two Ashvin months, one is auspicious and other isn't. The inauspicious one is called Malmaas, or Purushottam Maas. This will wrap up on 16th October, and hence, the auspicious Navratri will begin on from 17th October. Why two months? A lunar month which has two new moons (amavasya) is called mala maas, when no auspicious rites and rituals can be performed. This year, Ashvin is such a month. Consequently, Durga Puja will be deferred till the inauspicious part of this lunar month is over and take place in the next auspicious duration. Hence, this explains a month long gap between Mahalaya and Navratri.  However, I don\u2019t think Durga Puja willl be observed in my locality this year due to present conditions, which is terribly upsetting. What about yours? ",

            "answer_text": "Durga Puja 2020 will be celebrated in the month of October with Mahalaya on 17 September and Maha Panchami on 21 October. What Is the Durga Pooja Mahalaya Celebration? Mahalaya denotes the opening of Durga Puja festivities. Evidenced at the end of Shradh or Pitru Paksha, 16 days when Hindus pay homage to their ancestors, Mahalaya commemorates the starting of the Durga Puja festival. The devotees believe that deity Durga arrived on the Earth on the day of Mahalaya. Mahalaya 2020 Date and Time Shradh or Pitru Paksha end witnesses Mahalaya\u2019s celebration. Mainly a festival of Bengalis, Mahalaya is commemorated across the country. Mahalaya is a public holiday in several states in India. Celebrated on Sarvapitri Amavasya (new moon) in the month of Bhadrapada, Mahalaya is in the current year on September 17.  What Is the Significance of Mahalaya? \u2018Maha\u2019 denotes to great, and \u2018Alaya\u2019 means abode combine to make a Sanskrit word Mahalaya. There is a belief that on the day of Mahalaya, deity Durga and her children commence the journey from Mount Kailash to her parental residence on Earth. The devotees invite deity Durga in her home through recitals, chanting, prayers, and ritual songs. The devotees believe that deity Durga came to Earth to assassinate the evil demon Mahishasura. Navratri and the wrong religious practices In India, people celebrate the festival of Navratri (Nine nights) by worshipping goddess Durga. It is generally celebrated in post monsoon period in the month of Ashwin, which falls in the months of September and October. People put up pandals, decorate them, offer puja and organize many events such as garba and dandiya during Navratri. It is celebrated to commemorate the victory of goddess Durga to restore Dharma. Each of the nine nights have a different story for the celebration. Is the way of worship followed during Navratri in accordance to Bhagwad Geeta and Vedas? During Durga puja, devotees bathe the idol of goddess Durga, drape her idol in beautiful clothes, apply makeup and decorate her idol with beautiful jewellery. The idol is then offered garland of flowers and a plate full of delicious food, fruits and sweets as \u201cBhog\u201d. This entire process is a part of idol worship. Idol worship is nowhere stated in Bhagwad Geeta and Vedas. According to Bhagwad Geeta chapter 16 verse 23-24, it is stated that those who follow the way of worship opposite to the injunctions of Holy Scriptures neither get happiness nor any spiritual power nor salvation. This means it is absolutely useless. With this evidence it is clear that Durga puja is not in accordance to our scriptures. Is Durga married and does she have children? Durga is generally dressed like an Indian married woman with sindur (vermilion). Not many people are aware about the name of her husband. When asked, the prompt reply is Shiva. Well, Shiva is not her husband. Her husband\u2019s name is Kshar-Brahm or Jyoti Niranjan or Kaal. No one is aware about how and who created Kaal and Durga. Let me give you a brief insight into it. Initially this creation was non-existent. Only Supreme God was existing in a place called \u201cSatlok\u201d. He then created sixteen islands through His word power. He next created sixteen sons with the word power and allotted each island to each one of them and ordered one of the son; Achint to start with the work of creation. Achint created a being and named him Akshar Purush and ordered him to begin with the process of creation. However, Akshar Purush went in the Maan Sarovar and fell asleep. In Satlok, body is not made up of five elements, it comprises of only one element i.e. light. He kept sleeping for a very long time. Then, Supreme God took one of His soul (Kshar-Brahm) and inserted it into an egg made from the water of Maan Sarovar. When this egg was going down in the water, Akshar Purush woke up with its guzzling sound and gave an angry stare to the egg, because of which it broke and Kshar Brahm came out of it. Supreme God then ordered them to come out and live with Achint on his island. Kshar Brahm realized that all other brothers have their individual islands and he is living on one island with two of his brothers. Unhappy with this he started meditating on one foot for 70 yugas and obtained 21 universes. Since these universes were empty, he again meditated for 70 yugas again and obtained five elements and three gunas (Satgun, Rajgun and Tamgun). Now he wanted some souls from Supreme God so he meditated again for 64 yugas. However, upon listening to his demand, Supreme God rejected his plea and said that only if someone is willing to go with him in his universes, then he will get the souls. When Supreme God asked us for the first time if we wanted to go with him, we did not answer. At the second time, one of the soul raised its hand accepting the offer to go with Kshar Brahm. Looking at this, we too raised our hands. Supreme God said that he will send all of us in a specific way to his universe. The first soul who raised its hand was transformed into a beautiful girl and was not given the female genitals but she was granted word power. Supreme God put all of us in her body and blessed her to produce living beings with her word power for Kshar Brahm in his universe. She was called Prakriti or Ashtangi and later as Tridev Janani. Since she was very beautiful, Kshar Brahm lost his control and tried to rape her. He created female genitals on her body with his nails.To protect herself she took a miniature form and went in Kshar Brahm\u2019s stomach through his mouth and called Supreme God for help. Supreme God appeared in the form of his eldest son Jogjit and took Prakriti devi out from his stomach. He said since you tried to do an act which is prohibited in Satlok, both of you are expelled from Satlok and cursed Kshar Brahm to eat 1 lakh human beings daily and to produce 1.25 lakh humans daily. Once expelled, these 21 universes started moving away from Satlok and stopped at a distance of 16^10 Quadrillion Kms. Now, Kshar Brahm again forced himself on Durga and forcefully had a sexual intercourse with her. He forcefully married her and they both had three children Brahma, Vishnu and Shiv. There are evidences of this incident in Atharva Ved kaand no-4 Anuvaak no-1 Mantra-1 to 7, Rigved Mandal 10 sukt 90 Mantra- 1 to 5, 15 16, Shrimad Devi Mahapuran third skand Adhyay1-3 Adhyay 5, Bhagwad Geeta Adhyay 7 shlok 12, Adhyay 14 shlok 3-5 Adhyay 15 Shlok 1-4 and 16-17, Shiv maha Puran Rudra sahita Adhyay 6 and 7 and also in Kabir Sagar chapter bodh sagar. These references clarify that Durga\u2019s husband is Kshar Brahm and that Brahma, Vishnu and Shiv are their children. These references also prove that Supreme God is someone other than Durga and His name is Kabir. Is dancing and fasting during Navratri is mentioned in Bhagwad Geeta or Vedas? Garba is generally a folk dance which symbolizes the never ending cycle of birth and death with only one thing which is eternal \u201cGOD\u201d in this case \u2018Durga\u2019 whose idol is placed in the centre and people dance in circular movements. The question to be asked is, by performing garba dance can a soul actually attain salvation or moksha (freedom from the never ending cycle of birth and death)? There is no mention of performing Garba in Bhagwad Geeta or Vedas. This way of worship is opposite to the injunctions of Holy Scriptures as mentioned earlier and can never lead to salvation. This is not worship, this is pure recreation. Similarly Bhagwad Geeta also prohibits any kind of fasting in Adhyay 16 Shlok 6, where it is clearly stated that those who do not eat at all or those who eat more, or those who do not sleep or those who sleep a lot will never succeed on the path of spirituality and will never attain salvation. Has Durga given a hint to worship someone else? Who? In Sankshipt Devi Bhagwat published by Geeta press Gorakhpur edited by Hanuman Prasad Poddar in Skand 7 Adhyay 37 56-563, goddess Durga has advised king of Himalaya-Himavat to worship Brahm over and above all deities. She has very clearly described that Brahm lives in \u201cBrahmlok\u201d and that his mantra is \u201cOm\u201d. Can Durga give us salvation? No god or goddess is capable of granting salvation to us because only Supreme God \u2013 Kabir Saheb Ji is capable of giving us salvation. Only Supreme God is capable of forgiving even the most heinous sins of human beings -Yajurved Adhyay 8 mantra 13. One can attain salvation only if all your sins are forgiven and you are free from karmic deeds. Kabir Saheb says our true Father can forgive all our sins and make us happy. Who is giving this true spiritual knowledge? Today, only a true saint \u201cSant Rampal Ji Maharaj Ji\u201d is giving this right way of worship and true knowledge of scriptures. To know more about Supreme God \u2013 Kabir Saheb Ji, listen to the discourses of Jagatguru Saint Rampal Ji Maharaj on Sadhana channel 7:30 pm IST. Pitra Worship and Diety Worship Not Worth Observing In Shrimad Bhagavad Gita Chapter 9 Verse 25, the narrator Kaal Brahm explains to Arjun, anyone who desires something through Devotion attains the desired destination. A devotee who wishes to achieve heavens will achieve them. Similarly, a devotee can reach to the pitras worlds by performing a pitra worship (Shradh) or ghost planes. A devotee who worships deities reach to deities, i.e., they become their servants there. Likewise, a pure devotee, who worships only the Supreme God strictly in compliance with the holy scriptures will attain the Eternal Abode Satlok. Yanti, devvrtaH, devaan, pitrn, yaanti, pitrvrtaH,Bhootaani, yaanti, bhootejyaH, yaanti, madhyaajinH, api, mam ||BG9:25|| Those who worship the gods take birth among the gods; those who worship pitras go to pitras; those who worship ghosts go to ghosts; likewise, my devotees, who worship following the scriptures, attain me. God Kabir also says: Jahan aasa tahan basa hoyi Man karam vachan sumariyo soyi True Devotion As Per Holy Scriptures Shrimad Bhagavat Gita verse 17:23 defines the methods of right worship. Om (\u0950), Tat, Sat, iti, nirdeshH, brahmnH, trividhH, smrtH,BraahmnaH, ten, vedaH, ch, yagyaaH, ch, vihitaH, pura ||BG17:23|| Om (\u0950) is a mantra of Brahm, Tat is coded mantra of Par-Brahm, and Sat is coded mantra of Purna-Brahm. In this way, there is the direction of remembrance of three types of mantras of Purna Parmatma, and at the beginning of nature, based on that very Tatvgyan, the scholars created Vedas and Yagya, etc. They used to worship according to that. Initiated from a Purna Guru Does Not Convict in the Sins Committed Ignorantly The essence of Bhagavad Gita Chapter 18, Verse 5 to 28, is that all the actions cannot be relinquished in 6 are worthy of being relinquished. The actions performed for farming, walking, cooking kill living beings that cannot be given up. Its solution lies in following a complete Guru. The Absolute God Kabir Saheb says \u2014 Ichchha kar marae nahin, bin ichchha mar jay. Kahae Kabir taas ka, paap nahin lagaay. Go in the Refuge of the Supreme God. The Gita narrator Brahm says in Chapter 18 Verse 62, You, in every respect, go in the refuge of only that Supreme God. By the grace of that Supreme God, you will attain the supreme peace and the everlasting place, i.e., Satlok.
