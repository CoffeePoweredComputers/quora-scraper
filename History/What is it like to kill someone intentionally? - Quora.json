            "answer_text": "What is it like to kill someone intentionally? For me? Irritating. I spend my life doing as little as possible, and the act of killing someone is so monumentally work producing that the very idea that I have to go through so much effort to cover up the crime, and dispose of the body and ensure that no one finds out, all just to avoid prison is just so much work. So, intentionally killing someone? It\u2019s an irritating hassle, I don\u2019t feel like going through all of the effort of making sure I don\u2019t get caught, and if I do get caught then it\u2019s an even bigger more irritating and perhaps worst of all: boring experience of going to prison. I don\u2019t like my time being wasted and I don\u2019t like being bored. Killing someone produces a monumental amount of my time being wasted and risks the ultimate form of boredom (sitting in a concrete box with nothing to do). Beyond that I don\u2019t really feel anything about it one way or another. You might as well be asking \u201cwhat is it like to intentionally break a pencil?\u201d Well, you snap the pencil and then you clean up the dust. Hopefully you didn\u2019t get any splinters, that would be irritating. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it can\u2019t be generalized easily, everyone has a specific reason to commit whatever action on their choice. Killing someone intentionally is not a simple decision of course, it takes more than accumulative reasons of certain period that would trigger the intention. And if you said intentionally, that means it takes planning to manifest the action, and the consideration, and it\u2019s gonna involve the thoughts about the risks of the action, and courage, it\u2019s not a simple one as everyone would take this decision against the knowledge of he / she has also the survival sense that supposed to be in everyone else, then decide to break this. I believe it\u2019s not easy decision for whoever and whatever they are, and I hope you wouldn\u2019t have this intention. ",
