            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re talking about guns, then it\u2019s a bit of a grey line. The probably oldest actual guns still used in wars today would either be the Lee-Enfield, C96 Mauser, or Gewehr 98. The early models of those guns are still in service, although by terrorists. The oldest gun/machine gun still being produced is the .50 cal M2 Browning MG. And the oldest actual \u201cgun\u201d kept in any military arsenal would be all the cannons still sticking out of the USS Constitution. But if we\u2019re talking about weapons in general, then it would be the good \u2018ol fashioned fists. Even before we\u2019re sapiens we\u2019ve been using them. ",
