            "answer_text": "There are no signs or indictions from a house itself that there is a secret treasure is hidden within it. Houses are built to provide shelter, cover, comfort, security, etc. Even when a house appears fascinating from the outside because of its age or design, that is not a sign that there is a secret treasure hidden within it. It is not even an indication or hint of a greater likelihood of a possible treasure. Plenty of house-owners (and relatives of house-owners) literally \u201cstrip\u201d the house of valuables just prior to a house being sold. For example, I bought an old house that an older woman had lived in for 50 years. When it was time for her to go to a nursing home, her relatives came in and took (replaced) home artifacts from the house. They took old doorknobs, cupboard doorknobs and replaced them with cheap doorknobs. They took old cabinet doors and replaced what they took with cheap cabinet doors. Over time homeowners and relatives of homeowners are famous for cannibalizing older homes for their original antique parts and replacing those parts with modern cheap items. People who search for treasures connected to houses research former occupants (home-owners), not the houses themselves. And the reason why is simple. Anyone who may hide something in one\u2019s house is expected to retrieve or dispose (e.g., sell off) those hidden things before they relocate and leave. The proper focus for treasure hunting is people and historical events that happened (mostly) in certain locations of the country and what time period a person lived in a house home. So you have to know how to research people (and mostly long dead people). How would you go about researching long-gone people in your community to get an idea about their habits? Today, most people start with Library research reading newspaper archives about historical events and people in one\u2019s community. They may also pick a decade long time period that they think signals potential \u201chiding\u201d of valuables, such as during The (USA) Great Depression, or in a different country devastating Wars. When it is said that during World War II that Germany hid great amounts of wealth in different places, where did they find that wealth to steal? What they did is they \u201cbought\u201d neighbor spies \u2014who told them who the wealthy people were in a community, then raided those homes, and tortured people to reveal their hiding spots. So if you want to hunt \u201clost treasures\u201d you have to examine people and know everything there is available to know about individuals: Their occupation, their homes, their businesses, their \u201cplay places\u201d (example: cabins, gambling places, etc.), their community reputation, their living relatives (if any), why they might be considered \u201crich\u201d during their day. Were they known as cheaters of others, or honest? Were they ever arrested and for what? Were they generous or not? Did they die suddenly, like in an accident? Or slowly such as from a disease? THESE ARE THE SIGNS; and not at all houses. Plenty of older people in their day were far wiser than people today, because they lives their whole lives in one community; and many endured a lot of economic hardship during their day. Before there was Social Security Pensions it was up to people to save some of their financial wellbeing for their retirement years. If they died suddenly and had no relatives that would be a person of interest\u2014because as it is said, \u201cyou cannot take what you have accumulated with you (at death)\u201d. Many treasure hunters specialize to attempt to increase their odds (chances) of finding something. They do all the same research mentioned above, but focus on the reputations of often \u201clong gone\u201d people. Here is what I am refering to? Do you know who the bootleggers were in your community during Prohibition? Those people had an illegal income source, when others were jobless. So some treasure hunters focus on Prohibition crime. Others focus on any crimes (reported in newspapers), where the culprits were caught but the \u201cgoods\u201d were not found at the time the criminal was caught. Where did the criminal hide it before getting caught? Some focus upon famous outlaws and gangs. Some focus on people who knew secret details about criminal activity (now, who might those people be ???). Some focus on traveling salesmen of very long gone days, and what route did they travel, and where might they have camped as they traveled from town to town? Others focus on gambling locations. But here is the thing. Long gone people knew to avoid \u201cputting all their eggs into one basket\u201d. So you must-must know where they liked to spend their free time, their \u201cplay time\u201d. Were they regularly at the golf course(?), such as early in the morning and even on \u201cwet days\u201d, or their favorite fishing location(?), or hunting location(?). The sign of \u201cpotential\u201d is discovered in people and their habits, not in houses that become for the most part \u201cone basket\u201d, where everything can be lost with one home-fire, as happened frequently in long-ago days (and when fabrics flamed up easily from just a dropped cigar ash, and when house (uninsulated) wood was dry, and when home heating included a lot of warmth time at a fireplace. When one spreads \u201ctheir eggs\u201d around into more than one basket, all sorts of locations become possible, which can be important when today one may not have access anymore to specific older properties. The best read for clues is (long-gone) Karl Von Mueller, Treasure Manual #6 (Eldorado). He writes about clues from the 1920s-1950s; and goes to great lengths to describe the research process (and gives hints about why it is important). Since that book was a limited edition, I would anticipate that remaining copies could cost hundreds of dollars. ",
