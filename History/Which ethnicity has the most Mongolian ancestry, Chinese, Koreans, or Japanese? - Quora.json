            "answer_text": "Well if we take Haplogroup O as Chinese  and Haplogroup C3-M130/M217 as Mongolian which reaches the highest frequencies among the populations of Mongolia and Siberia then you can see which countries are closer to Mongolians and which are closer to Chinese.  From this pic Koreans have higher C compared to China and Japan.Specially Korea Gyeongsan region is at highest with 16,7%. Han Chinese on the other hand only 6% overall. Since China is big we also can divide it. Inner Mongolians are 46% but still much less than Mongolians ,probably because of mix. Manchus are also very close with more than 20% . Tibet and Japan have almost no relation to Mongolians. But just look at Tibet,they are so different from China and closer to Japan which is shocking.Korea is also interesting case. They look like mix of everything. ",

            "answer_text": "The Chinese population is so diverse in ethnicity that it is impossible to tell how close they are to the ancient Mongolians. Of the other two, the Koreans and the Japanese, the former has the more Mongolian ethnicity, because Japan is geographically separated from the continent. ",
