            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Vijay. What man, what is happening? Subscribed recently to the \u201cPokkisham\u201d or joined Paari Anna gang??? Or simple Corona quarantine anguish :) :) Anyway let me bite. Mesoamerican civilization and its origin is dated to 1200 BC with the advent of Olmec culture.There is no contemporary evidence from both sides that might indicate transpacific origins of Mayans, especially from ancient Tamil region.Some of the cultural markers of Olmecs such as feline creatures as religious forms or use of jade and stuff is not documented in Tamil history.Olmecs and subsequent mesoamerican civilizations had rigid class structure with pronounced aristrocratic elite, which is absent in ancient Tamil region.All civilizations will have some common cultural marker or other, probably because they all originated from one place and spread to other places. That does not mean anything. Take for example - ancient Celtic druids had this tradition of burning a wicker man. I mean not that different from Ravan effigy burning. Does not mean Celts migrated from India or vice versa. Probably an ancient tribal practice retained by the tribes that spread across the world.Problem with all these tall claims is people tend to take only that part of history which may be used as some kind of spurious. The Pokkisham dilettante mentioned sun royal lineage by Cholas and Mayans as proof. But the problem is no ancient Cholas ever claimed any sun lineage. In fact, except as part of nature worship, sun is not even that big a deal among Tamils. We worship water (Aadi perukku, manjal neeratal etc.), not the sun. Recent scientific works have given tangible proof of Mesopotomia/Iranian origin of Tamils. So why not similar origin for Mayans or as some studies suggest that Olmec/Mesoamerican civilization were extension of ancient Shang civilization of China. I mean if you look by strict scientific eivdence Shang origin of mesoamerica is far more likely than any imagined Tamil origin. And even if Tamil civilization was the source of everything in our galaxy and other distant galaxies, which it is not, it means absolutely nothing now. I think Pokkisham kind of dilettantes are replacing Pornhub watching with cultural orgasms. ",
