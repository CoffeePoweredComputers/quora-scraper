            "answer_text": "I do not completely understand your question, as Czechoslovakia was intended to be a nation after WW2. In the Potsdam Conference, the allies did decide to give freedom to all remaining \u201coccupied\u201d nations of Nazi Germany. Another thought the allies had in mind was the Sudetenland, which was a large are in Czechoslovakia populated by ethnic Germans. For the issues the Soviets decided to make the Czechs forcefully expel all Germans living in the Sudetenland to Mainland Germany or Austria. Hungary was also forced to leave the territories it occupied in Slovakia for its territorial integrity. Another reason why it was \u201cput together\u201d was for the Soviet Union to expand its influence into Europe, and allow Communism to spread, not actually intended by other allies. The allies wouldn\u2019t have just simply let Germany have Czechoslovakia after the war, or let the nation get slurped up into the USSR. However, this was no gift of freedom to the Czechs, as the Soviets established a Communist regime there, and also annexed a small region in Eastern Czechoslovakia called the Carpathian Ruthenia, which had a Ukrainian majority - leading it to be annexed by the Ukrainian SSR. After WW2, Czechoslovakia had recognition with a lot of European Nations, also including superpowers like the US and USSR. It also led up to becoming one of the founding members of the UN. I hope this helped! : ) ",
