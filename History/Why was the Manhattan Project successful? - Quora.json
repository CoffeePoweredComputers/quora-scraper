            "answer_text": "A combination of factors which Carey Sublette has covered, but I would make some other comment. I have to think about this because many of the principals are no longer with us and their follow-ons have limits to what they can say. First credit must be given to Roosevelt for giving a nod to the letter signed by Einstein and drafted by Szilard and Teller. And 15% of that credit also goes to Churchill and the MAUD. Similarly, a degree of luck was involved for the failure of the Nazis and Japanese to adequately fund and populate their projects. They had a shorter term war fighting horizon. I would also argue that the Nazis had some fine theoreticians but lacked a sufficient collection of experimentalists by the lack of all kinds of instrumentation like cyclotrons. The USA had Ernest Lawrence, and quite a few more experimentalists like Glenn Seaborg (along with his students) who was responsible for developing Pu and other trans-uranic elements (this kind of stuff was inspiring to a new generation of physicists {to this day creating new elements past 120}). In turn the US gained Fermi. These details tend to be neglected by those claiming the Axis projects had serious standing. Bohr himself said that a country to develop a bomb would literally have to turn the entire country into a factory (Oak Ridge\u2019s size confirmed that to himself). Next, the project really took off with Gen. Leslie Groves. He was fresh from building the Pentagon. And he had to defend his decisions for war time expedience in selecting J. Robert Oppenheimer. Oppie seemed to have the unique ability to herd cats among his scientists. Groves recognized this. They absolutely needed each other. You could not have had the one without the other (some would argue Beria in post-WWII could do that, but that\u2019s a weak argument because those others would rest their arguments of the work already done by Groves and Oppie). Carey is right that they explored a variant of options simultaneously (that\u2019s the war time expedience). The USA had the excess industrial capacity. The decision to get tons of Au and Ag when Cu had to be used in other military areas (competition) was indicative of some of the lengths the Project had to stretch (it\u2019s reflected at some of the National Labs to this day). But it was way more than materiel but also huge numbers of people (as high as 100,000) most of whom were not privy to the ultimate objective, much less understand how the objective worked (which is why questions about early prototyping abound (that was all nuclear theory; this theory was a few decades old, and the neutron was known for about a decade at that time)). The Project had its priority without being revealed until use. I would also add that there were degrees of American over-engineering involved to make certain that a weapon/device would work (e.g., holes in the N-reactor and the Mark III Fat Man). Ideas were suspended until after the War and those improved subsequent efficiency (went into the Mark IV and subsequent versions). The attitude was get it done quickly to end the War. The work force at all levels wanted the War to be over. Short version. ",

            "answer_text": "Why was the Manhattan Project successful?  You could spend a great deal of time researching that question, as my bookshelves and disk drives can show. I\u2019ll try to give a short answer, but it\u2019ll lack many details. The Manhattan Project included multiple efforts into single problems. The most notable example was that of uranium enrichment (more accurately termed \u201cisotope separation\u201d). Extensive work went into gaseous diffusion and electromagnetic separation. There was also work on ultra-centrifuges, though that effectively put on hold. They also adopted the thermal diffusion system the US Navy was working on, and used a scaled-up system to enhance the feedstock for the electromagnetic separation facility. At the same time, they also worked on developing plants for producing, extracting, and refining plutonium. That provided yet another potential source of fissile material. This isn\u2019t an efficient way to work, since it guarantees that some of your work won\u2019t be very productive. It\u2019s effective, though, because you\u2019re not gambling on one process. Even while the researching methods to produce U-235 and Pu-239, other groups were working on discovering the characteristics of those exotic materials, working on the theoretical background of fission reactions, or techniques for building bombs. There were also less obvious projects, such as researching explosives, designing new detonators, and developing specialized testing techniques. All these activities went on in parallel. It was an extremely expensive enterprise, and an absurdly uneconomical way to do things. The only thing that made the Manhattan Project possible at all was that the United States had the ability to devote enormous resources to it. One big factor that\u2019s often overlooked is the willingness of people to do whatever it took to do the job. Researchers put their careers on hold. Workers put up with remote locations, hastily built towns, and heavy security. Most people really didn\u2019t know precisely what they were working on, but it was part of the war effort. Obviously, not everyone was whistling, \u201cHi ho! Hi ho!\u201d, but enough people were willing to put up with the hassles. ",
