            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not just a matter of translation. In the second century, Lucian describes crucifixion as stretching the victim\u2019s arms out across a T-shaped implement. Irenaeus, another second century author, describes Roman crucifixion as involving two separate pieces of wood: an upright post and a cross-beam. The oldest depiction of a Roman crucifixion shows the victim nailed to a T-shaped cross. Both the Epistle of Barnabas (late first century) and Clement of Alexandria (second century) attach significance to the number 300/the Greek letter T because of its semblance to the cross of Jesus. Plutarch and Plautus both describe the victim of crucifixion as first having their arms nailed or tied to a cross-beam and then being forced to walk to the place of crucifixion, where they were hoisted into the air and the cross-beam affixed to either an upright post or scaffolding. Tertullian mentions that victims were sometimes crucified by being nailed to a tree (which precludes impalement). When an upright stake was used, the victim was typically impaled through the groin, not stretched out and nailed to it (as depicted by the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses). Plutarch differentiates between crucifixion on a cross and impalement on a stake, but Seneca uses the word \u201ccrucifixion\u201d for both methods of execution. The gospel authors in the first century apparently imagined something other than crucifixion on an upright stake, because (1) they describe multiple nails used for the hands; (2) the sign listing charges against Jesus is mounted above his head and not his hands; and (3) the soldiers were prepared to break his legs to force a death by suffocation, which is only applicable to the traditional cross-shaped crucifixion. It\u2019s also important to recall that crucifixion was practiced by the Romans up until the time that Constantine abolished the practice. The traditional imagery of Jesus crucified on a cross, which is extolled by many ancient Christian authors, developed while the practice was still common. When they read (in their native Greek dialect) that Jesus was crucified on a stauros, they imagined our traditional version of the crucifixion on a cross, and it doesn\u2019t seem to have occurred to any of them that Jesus might have been nailed to an upright post or stake. If the Alexamenos graffito is any indication, the same thing was true for the pagan Romans. When the creator of the graffito decided to mock Christianity by depicting its founder with the head of an ass, he clearly imagined the crucifixion as occurring on a traditional cross; and again, this image was created during the heyday of Roman crucifixion. Herodotus (mentioned in a comment) isn\u2019t really relevant to the discussion, since his works predate Roman crucifixion by a good two centuries, and he wrote in the Ionic dialect. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember coming across something that stated, while crucifixion was definitely used at that time in parts of the empire, in the fashion of an uppercase-T, the lack of large lumber in that part of the world meant that crucifixions were usually carried out with smaller lumber shaped in an \u2018X' that the executed was splayed out upon and left to die. It's a matter of people in Europe telling and selling the life and death of J.C. The truth is, the people of Jerusalem didn't have ready access to acceptable lumber to construct full buildings, nevermind wasting a bunch of good, strong, sturdy lumber on killing a few people. Not to mention the cost of transporting just the lumber. ",
