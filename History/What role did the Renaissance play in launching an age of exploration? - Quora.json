            "answer_text": "Most likely none. The age of exploration was well on its way by the time the Renaissance was in reasonable swing. Prince Henry the Navigator sent his ships to Madeira in 1415, and Gutenberg did not get his printing press, one of the core technologies to enable the Renaissance, operational until 1450. This holds even if Henry is no longer taken to be a patron of navigational sciences, but more likely just interested in tracing out the trade routes that were affecting his kingdom. ",
