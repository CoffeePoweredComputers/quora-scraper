            "answer_text": "Yes, I have received the punishment, and I think mine might have been a bit worse than the others. Whenever I was 9 years old and in grade 4, my parents went on vacation for a month and a half. My sister was 17 years old and had just finished high school early. My sister was put in charge to watch me. As soon as my parents left, she jumped right into it. \u201cI\u2019m the boss now so you do what I say.\u201d I responded with \u201cOkay\u201d. Then she said that I was now her servant and I was to call her \u201cmaster\u201d or she would call mom and dad for not listening. I knew what being a servant meant and that this was going to be a difficult month and a half, but it got worse. (My parents were sending money if you were wondering) I was new at my school. We had just moved and it was the Saturday after the first week. So I didn't have friends and nobody really knew me. Then my sister told me: You are not allowed to go to the toilet and you are going to wear diapers. I was terrified but I knew I had to do what she said. \u201cOkay master\u201d. She left the room and came back with 3 large packs of youth diapers she told me to put 2 on so it was extra bulky and embarrassing. At home, I wasn\u2019t allowed to wear pants. Just a shirt and I had to do work for her. I had to rub her feet. She had a bell to ring when she needed me to do something for her. The next day (Sunday was the day after and I hadn\u2019t been to school with my diapers on yet and the only person who saw me in them was my sister. It got bad really quickly. My sister had a boyfriend who played baseball. He had a baseball game that day so after the game, they all came to the house to watch a movie and celebrate. That was 20 intimidating, judgy, teenaged boys coming and I had to attend to them. When they arrived they laughed at me and my sister explained that I was the servant and they could ask me anything she doesn't care. I had to rub their feet, get them snacks, etc. Then Monday was school. My sister made me wear 2 extra bulky diapers and I was only allowed to wear tight pants like leggings. She said if I needed I diaper change I would have to ask in front of the whole class if I can go to the nurse's office and get my diaper changed. Also, if someone asked my why I wore a diaper I had to say it was because I was a big baby. When I got to the buss you could hear the crinkling of the diaper and people started yelling out \u201cShe\u2019s wearing a diaper!\u201d and laughing. It was so embarrassing. I sat alone on the bus and when I got to school it was even worse. All the kids knew that I had diapers on and all watched me at races. When I gave in and peed my diaper. Then in class, I had to ask to get my diaper changed and everyone laughed at me. It continued like that for a month and a half and my parents never found out. My reputation at school was ruined forever. and the next year, the same thing happened. ",

            "answer_text": "I always had a weak bladder and often would get up 6-8 times a night to use the bathroom. I was dating a nurse at the time and one night accidentally wet our bed. She suggested that I start wearing a diaper, and honestly I was too embarrassed to. A couple of nights later, it happened again ! \u201c You'll acting like a baby by wetting our bed, again !!\u201d I'd never her seen her so mad. I have a great job, very responsible and had never been called a baby before. Long story short, it happened again a few days later. She came home from work carrying a plastic bag the following day. I didn't think much of it at the time. We got ready for bed and she gave me a choice. \u201cHoney, I love you more than you will ever know. But your bed wetting has to stop, so I'm gonna give you a choice. I\u201dve always wanted a baby, but as you know I can't have any children, so I have an idea. You either let me put a diaper on you or this relationship is over.\u201d I didn't say a word, I was in shock. She grabbed a diaper out of the plastic bag she had brought home from work. \u201c I begged her not to leave me. She blindfolded me and told me to relax and to do exactly as she said. She took my underwear off and told me to roll over on my side. As I did, she placed the diaper underneath of me. She grabbed me and rolled me over to my other side. I thought about fighting her, but I didn't want to lose her. I felt baby powder being sprinkled on me, but I didn't say a word. The next thing I know was the worse part. I felt the diaper being pulled up in between my legs and being fastened very tightly. I was beyond embarrassed and actually started to cry out of shame ! \u201cIts ok sweetie, I got this idea from a co-worker who actually had the same problem with her husband. You actually look really cute wearing a diaper.\u201d I was still really embarrassed and very upset. \u201cIs my baby hungry ?\u201d I had no clue what was gonna happen next. I was basically forced to wear a diaper against my will or I would lose the women I loved. She grabbed my head and brought it towards her. Still blindfolded, I had no idea what was gonna happen next. I then felt her nipple brushing up against my lips ! She had beautiful 38D cups btw. \u201c I want you to latch on baby and try to nurse from mommy.\u201d It took a few trys, but I was finally able to latch on to her nipple and started suckling. I must confess, as soon as I started to nurse, I completely forgot the fact I was wearing a diaper. I must had dosed off pretty fast, probably after about 20 minutes or so. Sometime during that night, I woke up. My blindfold was off and I looked up to see that I was being changed ! \u201cGo back to sleep sweetie, your diaper was soaked.\u201d I don't remember the rest of the night but when I woke up, she had already gone to work and left a note. \u201c You have no idea how much I loved last night. We finally solved your bedwetting issue and I got what I wanted from you. I love you baby so much and btw I would never leave you.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I believe I was either 4 or 5? I had been wetting myself and the bed almost from the time I was supposedly toilet trained. Apparently I was the subject of a discussion or two while I wasn\u2019t present? One day my mother and grandmother had left my cousin Annette to babysit the four of us children, all under the age of 5. Or, two sets of twins born in under a year separation. Of the four of us, \u201cI\u201d was apparently the only one still wetting themselves? Rather than sending me to a doctor to have it looked into? It was decided that it was more likely I was still doing this to get some sort of extra attention. Apparently my aunt had said that if it happened again, She was going to take matters into her own hands and if that happened, in all likely hood \u201cI\u201d would be so shamed I would never wet myself or the bed again. (Wrong) Naturally, in short order it happened again. As I remember it 50+ years later? I think Annette was doing some laundry to help my mother out, while she was also babysitting us 4. She was in the laundry room, and all of a sudden we heard a rather loud bellow from that direction,\u2026 WHO\u2019S WET PANTS ARE THEEESE! As I recall all movement between us four stopped dead in our tracks. A pregnant pause of silence as we all looked at each other wondering what to do or say next? Then we heard a rather accusatory,\u2026 PAUL STEVEN RYAN! Are these wet pink pants YOURS!? Another pregnant pause,\u2026. Ahhhhh, YYYYeeeessssss? I could scarcely move my mouth to say that with any certainty or force behind it. Annette\u2019s response,\u2026 OH, REALLY! We\u2019ll just have to see about that! COME HERE MISTER! I was quaking in my boots and I am sure the others knew it. The laundry shed door closed for a minute or two and we could hear some movement of what sounded like cabinet doors. A full 3 minutes later Annette emerged waving a thick white cloth out in front of her body and staring at me with a scowl on her face that in my estimation would stop a clock. I got up and ran into my mother\u2019s bedroom and tried in vane to close the door. Annette was a little too quick for me! She forced the door open and grabbed my pants with her free hand. I almost submitted to her grasp in defeat still not knowing her intentions. I stood still long enough for her to pull down both my pants and realized her intent when my underware came down too!? The best I could do at this point was to jump up onto my moms bed and high tail it to the headboard. I was surprised I was able to escape her grasp and made it up to the pillows. I was too far away for her to grasp me easily as I jump ran from one side to the other of the bed. She made a lucky grab at me and I fell foward safely onto the msttress. Quick as a wink she grabbed my shirt and flipped me into my back while she pulled me down and closer to the foot of the bed as my brothers and sisters cheered her on. I was too busy trying to escape to be embarassed. I finally gave up and relaxed in defeat and although it didn\u2019t show, I actually enjoyed myself as she powdered, diapered and put me into plastic pants \u201cFor good measure\u201d she said. Then, she sternly warned me not to wet my diaper or she would give me a spanking I would not soon forget. I thought even at that young age that she might have been a little mad at me because the diaper was on rather snug. Which was ok by me cause I rather liked it that way. Matter of fact, that was probably the first incident where I realized I preferred my diapers to be rather snug rather than loose fitting and prone to leaks. I remained that way in a makeshift diaper and tee shirt for the better part of the afternoon. As I see it? The punishment backfired. I was rather quiet, and enjoyed my time in diapers despite being kidded and teased by my brothers and sisters as their way of joining into my punishment. Several hours later, and when I really did have to go to the bathroom,\u2026 Annette announced that If I thought I had learned my lesson come on over to her and she would hepl me to take off the diaper and put my pants back an again. And so ends a rather enjoyable afternoon back in diapers again. ",

            "answer_text": "My diaper punishment story is a bit different from most others in that it involves multiple pairs of underwear being used on me as diapers, but it has many other elements of diapers and diaper punishment. The most significant element was associating the whiteness of my underwear, combined with the thickness and the fit/shape of it on my body, to how regular diapers look and fit on a boy\u2019s body, being white and thick, especially on the butt. Comparisons between my behavior as a boy and how my sisters behaved as girls, also played a significant role, along with comparisons between boys\u2019 white briefs looking like diapers, much unlike girls\u2019 panties. I was frequently \u201cdiapered\u201d in several pairs of boys\u2019 double-seated tighty whities, which happened fairly frequently from when I was four to when I was about seven or eight. It probably started out as a one-time measure by my mom to get me to use the toilet, but over time, in seeing its effectiveness as a punishment (not so much as a motivator to get me to use the toilet properly, because it wasn\u2019t), it evolved, developed and became more structured as I continued to have accidents and was thus \u201cdiapered\u201d for them. By age five or so my mom thought it was just me not wanting to cooperate, which was true because I always got in trouble anyway and I could never do it \u201cright\u201d (flushing, wiping, etc.) She always made sure I had lots of underwear in my supply and bought it in the next two or three sizes (which I would eventually grow into and could wear as \u201cnormal\u201d underwear). I have many memories of wearing all that diaper-like plain pure white underwear and seeing all those striped waistbands in red, blue and black, some with dashes and others with solid lines, which made what I was wearing very distinctively underwear, and also distinctively boys\u2019 underwear exclusively, much to the amusement of my sisters. My briefs were pulled up so high and tight on my body, the multiple stacks of fly fronts covering my whole stomach in front and going past halfway up my back in the rear, with larger pairs worn over the innermost pairs, and with even larger pairs worn over those. As the outermost pairs were always the newest, whitest pairs, this made my \u201cdiapers\u201d stand out extra white in gleaming contrast against the diminished whiteness of my shirt and socks, which became dingy with wear. My underwear on the outside always looked like the way a new 12-pack of white briefs looked when first taken out of the package while still folded together with all of the whiteness amplified by the layers of whiteness underneath. The innermost pairs were dingy and soiled from repeated exposure to large volumes of little-boy pee and poop and thus were never seen by my sisters. I couldn\u2019t walk normally because my thick underwear layers forced me to waddle. Whenever I sat down I could feel just how thick my underwear really was underneath me. It was even harder to walk when a lot of poop had piled up in my underwear. I\u2019m surprised that I could still walk normally when not encumbered by dozens of briefs. I could definitely feel the difference in the freedom of my leg movements when I didn\u2019t have all the underwear on me. With twice the material in the seat of each pair, this extra padding all really made my butt stand out and my sisters thought my underwear made me look like I was in really thick diapers. My butt was often their favorite focus of attention because it was my butt, which is inherently funny to children, especially to girls when it was a boy\u2019s butt in bunches of boys\u2019 underwear (as it looked nothing like their panties, which in turn did not at all resemble diapers), and it was where they knew all the stinky poop had to go and was and was the main reason I had to wear so much underwear at a time. I couldn\u2019t wear any pants as they wouldn\u2019t have even fit, so I had to go around the house all day and also to bed with 20+, sometimes over 30 pairs of briefs on and a shirt, sometimes socks. In the summer months I\u2019m sure I went for several days on end without ever wearing pants as I didn\u2019t leave the house often in my state of dress. My shirt was always deeply tucked in so that all of my underwear and all the waistbands had to show in their entirety and so that my sisters could see how high up my underwear went on me and to see as many waistbands at a time as possible. I can only imagine how incredibly amusing and satisfying this sight would be through the eyes and in the mind of a preteen girl with a female superiority complex. My sisters teased me constantly and said that boys are stupid and stinky and immature and belong in diapers no matter how old they are, which they reasoned was why boys\u2019 underwear was all white like diapers (which it was, back then). They said that boys shouldn\u2019t be allowed to wear pants and instead go around in diapers all the time, including to school. They compared their thin, skimpy, narrow-crotched low-rise, single-seated panties with thin and discreet waistbands, plus colors and patterns on them, to my big and thick plain white \u201cdiapers\u201d all the time (though they never wore their panties openly because, again, only boys wore their underwear in front of everyone). They patted my butt and snapped my waistbands, since they couldn\u2019t give me wedgies or \u201cpants\u201d me like other girls could do to their underwear-clad brothers, grabbing several waistbands at a time. They bragged about wearing pants and using the toilet and getting to leave the house since they had pants on and I didn\u2019t. They thought I looked cute and pointed out my bare, skinny legs that made my \u201cdiapers\u201d look even bigger on my butt, but complained when I smelled of poop, which was often. The high number of pairs I had on made it so that I couldn\u2019t wear pants, obviously, but also so that I couldn\u2019t try taking all my underwear off in case I were to try using the toilet (it was a punishment, so any expectations to use the toilet were gone at this time), to make my \u201cdiapers\u201d all the more conspicuous, and so that they would also hold pee, which required more absorbency, but at the same time provided extra padding to keep the poop in and keep it from leaking onto the floor or the furniture. Even though my underwear was always wet from pee by the time I stripped it off, my sisters didn\u2019t give me nearly as much attention for this as they did for the poop, which is why my memories concerning my butt and the poop that came out of it, are more numerous and clearly recalled. My mom also realized that, as a side benefit to my \u201cdiaper\u201d punishment, I couldn\u2019t be a bratty and obnoxious little brother to my sisters when I was \u201cdiapered up\u201d, because they automatically had the upper hand and were in an obvious position of superiority and command. I was always very well behaved when I was in \u201cdiapers\u201d. I felt really submissive, and my multiple briefs made me constantly aware of my situation, not to mention the feeling of sticky poop and being smelly. So my \u201cdiapers\u201d were used as a sort of behavioral control. I was also highly fixated on my penis always being erect any time I thought about my situation or saw myself in the mirror or looked down at the layers and layers of briefs stacked up so densely between my legs and coming up over my stomach. I wasn\u2019t old enough to really understand these oddly pleasant feelings just yet. The worst (or so it seemed back then) was when my sisters would invite their friends over, especially as sleepover guests. Over the years, a few dozen other girls got to see me all \u201cdiapered up\u201d in my underwear. At least my sisters didn\u2019t have to change me; that was my mom\u2019s job at first, and then mine when I was told that I could (usually after my sisters had taken their baths), but then I had to be \u201cdiapered up\u201d again. I think about this often because it turned me into a diaper fetishist, so I can remember a lot of details about it, because of the impact it had on my sexual development. Once I was eight or nine I didn\u2019t have quite so many pooping accidents, but I enjoyed the attention i got from my sisters for being in \u201cdiapers\u201d, so I continued to wear my underwear in multiples at bedtime, sometimes pooping in them on purpose, just for old times\u2019 sake and because it gave me such an incredible adrenaline rush. Ever since this all started, I always had intense erections from seeing myself in \u201cdiapers\u201d, and any time I looked at magazine diaper ads or catalog pages showing boys in diapers or in white briefs I got super excited. I made a lot of drawings of boys in diapers made up of lots of underwear with their sisters all wearing blue jeans while pointing and laughing at their bare-legged and pantsless brothers bending over and pooping in their plain white \u201cdiapers\u201d. I wrote several stories about boys whose sisters diapered them in lots of briefs and spent their whole lives dressed like this and had no pants to wear at all. It should come as no surprise that I was wearing a huge amount of briefs when I first ejaculated after discovering masturbation at around age eleven, which I did while thinking back on my \u201cdiaper\u201d punishment, and to this day, I still have yet to masturbate the \u201cnormal\u201d way. It really surprises me, however, that more boys didn\u2019t have experiences like this, because of how readily obvious it seemed for making the connection between plain white briefs and diapers, as I knew other boys who had frequent pooping accidents. Maybe it\u2019s something that boys just don\u2019t talk about, which I can understand, as I never shared any of this with anyone before the Internet came along for the average person to use. I did know of one other boy whom I saw in the boys\u2019 PE locker room in junior high school who had a similar situation involving wearing all white briefs in multiples for diapers, complete with sisters who loved to tease him and probably turned him into a diaper fetishist, too. Either he was braver than I was, or he was more messed up in the head by the way he was treated by his family, because he came to school wearing multiple pairs of underwear (with pants over them, always the same pair). I suspect he only wore the pants in school because he had to wear them there. This is another story that will have to find its place somewhere else on this site, though. I am impressed that so many other stories posted here are like mine in that extensive diaper punishment resulted in developing a fetish for diapers and a desire to wear them as an adult. ",

            "answer_text": "Quite a few times! It seemed to be my parents go to punishment. I was properly potty trained by 2 years old, but my parents being cheap, never threw out my old diapers when I was done with them, thinking they were having more kids. By the time I was five it was obvious they weren\u2019t having any more babies, but there sat on the shelf two boxes of diapers. One night I was playing legos and didnt get up to go pee, instead had an accident. I told my mom, she was mad, mostly because I ruined the carpet. She spanked me and had me stand in the corner with my bare red butt showing. When she told me to come up to my room there were the diapers. She had me lay down and she put one on. I was in them for three days to prove I could stay dry. When I was eight, my cousin spilled water on my pants and told my mom I wet my pants, she believed him over me, I she asked my aunt for one of my cousins diapers, I was in it just that for the rest of the day, and the way home she stopped at the store and bought a full package of the same brand, I had to wear them and stay dry until the package was gone. When I was ten, I was at daycare, I ended up having a small wet accident. My daycare lady told my mom when she picked me up. Instead of home, we went to Ames and she bought the largest box of the biggest baby diapers she could. I was in them until the box was gone, even at daycare. When I was 12, I forget exactly what I did, but ended up spending 2 months in Luvs at night. The last was when I was 15, my older cousin got me drunk off of some juice he made, I ended up wetting my bed that night. Instead of admitting I had drank, I told her I just slept to heavy. When I was in the shower, she left, when she came back she had 4 packages of extra large Goodnites in my room, she replaced my underwear with them. I ended up spending most if that summer just chilling in my Goodnite playing video games. ",

My aunts favorite thing to do was use diapers as punishment, for anything and everything. My first memory was waking up in a wet bed my first night there. My aunt picked me up and set me on my cousins changing table, took my wet clothes off, grabbed a blue pampers off the shelf and diapered me like she did my cousin. I spent the next two weeks in diapers \u201cgetting used to my new home\u201d. A week after I got out of them I peed on the seat, I spent the next week in diapers too. About once a month my little cousin would tattle on me for something and I would be diapered for it. When I was 8 and my older cousin was 12 we scared my little cousin so bad he peed himself, I was put in Luvs size 6 for 2 weeks and my older cousin was put in Goodnites. A week after I got out of them I had an accident in my pants at school, my aunt came into the nurses office with another Luvs diaper and fresh pants, diapers me, hands a handful to the nurse and asked her to change me once a day until they were gone. I spent the rest of school diapered, and most of that summer. By the time I was 10 I was having regular accidents at night to stay diapered. By 12 the Luvs stopped fitting, so my aunt switched to Attends Youth diapers. My older cousin snuck out of the house when she was 14, she got caught and diapered that night, she spent a month in diapers and was required to use them. I am 30 now and am still diapered every night for bed, by my aunt. Luckily most days are diaper free, not all, but some! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I received diaper punishment several times while growing up. When I was put into diapers I was told I was acting like a baby. So I was put into cloth diapers and plastic panties. I was not allowed to cover them up with any kind of clothing. I was on view for all to see. The only time I was allowed to cover them is when we went out in public. I had to use my diaper for their intended purpose. All my toilet privileges were revoked. I had no choise but to wet and mess my diapers like a baby. My older sister would go and tell my parents that I wet and filled my diapers with poop. It was embarrassing. My diaper changes were infrequent so I would get diaper rash. It was all part of my punishment. Punishments would be no less tan a week but could be much longer. After awhile I got very used to wearing and using my diapers. Sometimes I would have to be retrained potty trained. But I never did regain night time control. I was now a bed wetter. I would have daytime accidents from time to time. When those accidents happened I would be put in diapers again. I am now married and I wear my diapers 24/7. My wife takes good care of me. I wouldn't want it any other way. I am incontinent and love being in diapers. ",

I would have to do chores and wear just a diaper around the house. It didn\u2019t matter who stopped by. I had to go outside and to the park and any daily activities my family did in diapers and a T-shirt. I kind of learned to like it and would some times get in trouble just to wear a diaper. My whole eighth grade year at school I had to wear diapers. I was changed in the morning after breakfast. After lunch if I was at home or after school, before dinner and after a bath before bed. And maybe if I needed it but don\u2019t ask for it or it I was made to wait. At home all bathrooms was off limits. At school I wasn\u2019t allowed to use them but I tried. I became uncontrollably needed them and it didn\u2019t matter if I was Good I sometimes got diapers with characters on them as a reward. I met my now wife wearing a diaper with scooby doo on them an it\u2019s now a joke: did it ever work, not really I mean I didn\u2019t need a bathroom and I just went where ever. At times now as an adult I wish I could be treated this way again and it would be better. I mean no stopping on road trips to go no running in front he yard work or getting up front he tv does have benefits ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I have. I\u2019ve been having accidents since this late Summer, and my mom was getting tired of it, because I am a 12-year-old, and I should know better than to wet & soil myself. When I had another accident last week she said \u201cYou want to act like a baby?\u201d looking mad at me, like I was just doing this on purpose or something. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I mean, with a mother like mine, you KNOW you\u2019re in big trouble when she speaks in a mad tone and looks at you like that. I didn\u2019t know what to say except for a quiet \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry,\u201d and back away a little \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re sorry or not!\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m going to punish you no matter what.\u201d she added, glaring at me. I was shaken by how she looked at me. I was so scared of what she was going to do with me. Then I saw her coming back with an adult diaper, a Purple onesie (The one that doesn\u2019t cover your legs), a pacifier, and some baby powder. I didn\u2019t run away, I just surrendered to my fate. She told me to lay down, and I obeyed because I didn\u2019t want to be in any more trouble. She took off my wet pants and underwear, she took off my shirt also. She pushed my knees up to my chest, so she could put the diaper on. I looked so embarrassed, and when I tried to tell her to stop, she put the pacifier in my mouth. My dad looked surprised but didn\u2019t help me or anything (DADDY WHYYY). I felt the sprinkle of baby powder down there as my mom finally taped the diaper in place. She told me to sit up, and I didn\u2019t, refusing her punishment. She grabbed my hands and lifted me up, so I would be in a sitting position. She put the onesie on me and laid me back down, so my mom could fasten the buttons on the bottom of the onesie. When she told me I could get back up, I got back up, sat on the couch, and scowled at my dad. He was making that \u2018I didn\u2019t know what to do\u2019 face, and shrugged. My mom said we have to go somewhere soon to get me some nighttime diapers, and some plastic pants. She also said I had to go with her in the same outfit I was wearing right now. After that, I watched some tv, and we had a firestick, so I went on youtube and watched some Steven Universe Fanart stuff (RIP Steven Universe), and I was just about to get off of the couch when I had a blowout in my diaper. Then I felt a warm rush, filling the diaper even more, and I just found out I really needed to be changed. Mom looked at me, with a glance, she exactly knew what was going on. \u201cNeed to change already?\u201d she asked. I nodded, and I swiftly walked to the bathroom with her. It was SO EMBARRASSING being changed by my mom. She didn\u2019t complain about how much I messed, but it really is embarrassing to be changed by your parent. I did get powdered and diapered again after that. \u201cGood girl,\u201d she said, as I got up. That made me even more embarrassed. When we went to the store, I was only in my onesie and my diaper. I also had little cute socks on.  At the store, I\u2019m usually in the cart (like a toddler). At the store, my mom got me baby bottles, more diapers, and rash cream. I wet myself again, and was changed at the store. When we got home, she was going to feed me with a bottle, and I refused (If she says you\u2019re going to be a baby, she REALLY means it), but she forced it in my mouth anyway. I actually liked it, I felt like I was comforted by it for some reason. I Finally had my pacifier out, so I could talk, but the second my mouth opens, she says \u201cIf you want to talk, you have to talk like a toddler,\u201d as she looked at me. I really didn\u2019t want to do it, but I did it anyway, and babbled like a young child. Then she picked me up and burped me. I blushed right after I was I done, and got settled down for a nap. When I woke up, I asked my dad where my mom was, and he said she was at work.t was afternoon when she did, like, I guess, 3:30? My dad cut me some slack, and put some pants on me. I could just talk like a normal-aged kid in front of him, and didn\u2019t feed me with bottles or anything, just real food. He didn\u2019t care if I had the pacifier in, because he knew about my stress condition (pacifiers can relieve stress). I wet myself again, and I changed myself (with a little help from dad). Mom pulled up in the driveway, and dad put my pants off, because I would get punished for some reason. She came in the house, and didn\u2019t suspect anything wrong. I felt something hurting, but when I tried to tell my mom, I just babbled and looked angry at myself. Then I started crying, flailing my legs to show her that I was in pain. \u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201d she asked, looking surprised at me. I put my hand on my stomach, and babbled, hiccuping. Her surprised look faded into a relaxed look. \u201cOh, you just have a stomach ache,\u201d she was relieved that I just might be gassy. She gave me a stomach massage, but before she did the massage, she took my onesie off, and got some lavender baby oil (she did a baby massage for gas and stomach pain). When my mom brought up my knees to my chest until I had resistance, I had my lower trapped wind released, and I did have a bowel movement while I had the massage, sighing in relief. I mean, what was I supposed to do? Keep it in? After that, I got my last diaper change before going to bed. Going to bed was easy. All my mom had to do was put some plastic pants on me, and get me a bed pad, so I wouldn\u2019t leak on the bed. We went to the doctor to solve this problem, and he said that I had fecal and urinary incontinence. I was previously having kidney infections, so that caused my kidneys to release more urine than normal, even after I had recovered. The nerve that was connected to signaling that I needed to defecate was damaged, no, scratch that, completely gone. My mom was so sorry, so she let me wear normal clothes and talk like a normal person, but I still wore diapers so that I wouldn\u2019t have accidents. She was sad I wasn\u2019t her little girl anymore, though. I guess she missed me when I was a little toddler, or even a baby. I didn\u2019t want her to feel this way, so I put on my onesie and socks, put my pacifier in my mouth, and carried my blanket over my shoulder for a few minutes until she noticed. She was happy, but said that I didn\u2019t need to do this. I shrugged, and put my arms up so she could carry me. It\u2019s been a week now, and I\u2019m already a TBDL, and I get fed, changed, and bathed by my mom now. Call us a weird family, but, I really do love being taken care of by my mom like an infant.

We were driving, the first day to our vacation spot. I had to go and my father told me to just hold it. I tried, but was not successful. Good thing it was just a little one. I wet myself. After I had wet myself, I told my parents what happened. The next time we stopped, my father told my mother to put me into diapers. She actually put me into a diaper that was one of my baby sisters diaper and one of her plastic pants. The whole vacation I had to only wear the diapers, no pants, only the diaper, and a tee shirt. Yes my mother bought some larger diapers for me. Yes they were regular baby diapers, Pampers. Every car trip after that until the diapers didn\u2019t fit, I was forced to wear a diaper. ",

I still wear one now. But I suppose I was 'punished' on lots of other occasions, but for mainly wetting myself during the day. Like others that could or would involve more obvious diaper changes and on occasions I'd be spanked and be put back into diapers and plastic diaper cover knickers, which wear really humiliating as they would rustle and I'd be so ashamed of the fact I was obviously in a diaper and plastic knickers in public. I hid and so did my family, my diaper wearing but on occasions, if I was being punished or I'd wet myself it was obvious and said to those around I was 'not to be trusted' or 'I was stilll a baby' so yes I'd be changed or put into a nappy in public. I even remember being on holiday and I had to tell mom I'd wet myself and she exploded and dragged me back to the hotel, put me into a cloth nappy and plastic diaper cover panties and I had to sit with her on the beach in my nappy! I was 13! ",

Even had to play in the back yard dressed that way. If my mother had friends over they got to see me this way. My younger sister would always have her girlfriends over and they would laugh at me. My mother always seem to change me when they were there. Even let them powder me. I was so embarrassed, that until we moved to Florida, I could never look them in the eyes. ",

He made me change into my bedtime nappies and shorts and stay in them for the rest of the day. The worst part was he made such a big deal of it in front of my younger brother and sisters. He would make nasty comments to be funny. At dinner my Mum offered me a drink and he said you have one then you can wet your nappy like a baby - my brother and sisters thought it was funny, but I felt really embarrassed. ",
