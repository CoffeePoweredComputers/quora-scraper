            "answer_text": "Elvis\u2019 estate and finances are exceptionally complicated. When you ask for royalties, I assume you are referring to his music. In 1973, Colonel Parker negotiated a new deal with RCA. For the sum of 5.4 million dollars (which Parker and Elvis split 50/50) they sold the ownership rights to Elvis\u2019 RCA catalog to RCA. So from that point on, they received no royalties on that music. That\u2019s pretty much everything Elvis recorded pre 1973. RCA had already assumed the rights to Elvis Sun Record Recordings when they bought out the Sun contract. That value of that catalog after Elvis\u2019 passing obviously far surpassed the comparably small 2.7 million dollars that Elvis received. The Elvis Presley Estate receives all record royalties for anything produced after 1973. It\u2019s not a small amount, but far less than it could have been. Priscilla Presley and Lisa Marie Presley formed Elvis Presley Enterprises to handle the business of the estate including royalties, merchandise and Graceland. Lisa Marie is the sole owner of the Graceland property but it generates income for EPE. After some dire financial straits in the immediate years following the death of Elvis (Priscilla was said to have considered selling Graceland to pay off debt) , his estate is now by all accounts a very financially healthy operation.
