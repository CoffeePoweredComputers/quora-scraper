            "answer_text": "There are many good answers posted, and I can\u2019t really top them. I will add a few of my own observations. I\u2019m surprised how many people today are willing to accept the Warren Report\u2019s conclusion that Oswald acted as a lone wolf. That is still perhaps the majority opinion. However, if Oswald was the lone assassin, who would possibly have wanted his story suppressed? No one actually, not Jack Ruby, not LBJ, J Edgar Hoover, the CIA, the Mafia, or anybody. The fact that Oswald was \"rubbed out\" by a mob goon (Ruby) suggests there were one or more people who didn't want Oswald to \"sing.\" The two bullets to JFK's neck and head suggest a highly skilled shooter or shooters who made their target, not a rookie who missed. Imagine for a moment the envy and revulsion you would feel if you spent several decades in politics, starting at the bottom and working your way to become perhaps the best around when it came to pure politicking and consensus building, and you had ambitions to become president. Then right about the time of your ideal moment to run for the office, along comes a young glamor boy, son of a wealthy magnate, who hadn\u2019t paid nearly the price you did to get where he was, and this young playboy steals your limelight, and to add insult to injury, names you as his running mate mostly because you represent a voting block very different from his, without which he could not possibly win the race, \u2014 understand all this and you begin to see the very toxic dynamic between LBJ and JFK. No doubt, Johnson felt excluded from JFK\u2019s inner circle and very resentful. I\u2019m pretty sure LBJ was not receiving the daily presidential briefings, which all VPs receive nowadays. The book that opened my eyes to this dark picture of LBJ is Blood, Money and Power by Barr McClellan, a former government lawyer with inside knowledge. LBJ very much had the means, motive, and opportunity to engineer a plot that to this day remains hidden, except we do know about the conspiracy to suppress evidence conducted mostly by our government, which could be attributed to many causes. (Fear of an uprising, instability, threats to powerful people, JFK\u2019s desire to reduce tax loopholes for the oil industry, etc.) Don't forget, LBJ and Hoover were neighbors, both strongmen with their own agendas who must have enjoyed private conversations. LBJ had the motive: to kill JFK to \u201csave the country,\u201d and he might have easily arm-twisted Hoover into concealing evidence and lines of inquiry, possibly by threat of blackmail. Let\u2019s face it: dastardly deeds have been committed all throughout history. Why would American history be any different? Today, the Deep State is alive and well, virtually beyond the reach of elected officials. What happened to JFK could happen again. The Hillary Clinton / Russian email skullduggery going on today is quite possibly evidence of the Deep State(s) at work. Let\u2019s hope our government and all its nooks and crannies acts responsibly and for the greater good of the people, rather than personal and private agendas. And let\u2019s hope continued scholarship in the JFK assassination one day reveals the plot in full. Postscript: I recently finished Mary\u2019s Mosaic by Peter Janey and it changed my thinking. As the son of a high-ranking CIA officer, and family friend of Mary Pinchot Meyer, the subject of the book, Janey is intimately connected to his subject, which is the murder of Mary Meyer (JFK\u2019s primary mistress), and how it relates to the murder of JFK. While Janey believes Johnson was an active player in JFK\u2019s assassination, he claims it was the CIA\u2019s James Jesus Angleton who architected if not the coup itself, at least the coverup of the CIA\u2019s involvement. (Rogue elements of the CIA were involved, including perhaps Bill Harvey who hated JFK, according to Jefferson Morley\u2019s \u201cThe Ghost.\u201d) I highly recommend Mary\u2019s Mosaic, which is oddly more or less blacklisted from almost all media, yet it\u2019s not doing badly, already in its 3rd printing. Janey draws on many researchers, all of whom fill in bits of the puzzle to form a relatively clear outline of the Kennedy assassination, in which the CIA is central to the plot. The book also reveals new and shocking information on the close working relationship between CIA and the mainstream American press, which cooperated with CIA on spinning a great many stories, including JFK\u2019s assassination and the overthrow of many Communist dictatorships around the world in which the CIA was actively involved. According to Janey, JFK was killed mostly because of his vigorous pursuit of peaceful detente with the Soviets (particularly Khrushchev), his failure to deal aggressively with Cuba, his plans to scale down in Viet Nam, and his general optimism in mankind\u2019s ability to live in peaceful harmony, which conflicted with the agendas of the 3-letter agencies, which required perpetual conflict to justify their existence. This is of course consistent with Eisenhower\u2019s warning to beware of the military industrial complex and its expanding influence in American society. ",

            "answer_text": "For multiple reasons , first the CIA was helping Castro to take over Cuba , but oops the CIA goofed because Castro didn\u2019t tell them he was communist . After they found out they were then helping the anti-Castro rebels . They suggested to President Kennedy that the US should help the rebels by landing on the bay of Trinidad, Kennedy changed it to the bay of pigs ?(which wasn\u2019t a very good I idea because the bay of pigs was swamp land , the bay of Trinidad had sympathizers to the cause.) Kennedy also did not want to give much air support or support in general . So the bay of pigs failed only because of Kennedy\u2019s choices however, Kennedy fired Allen Dulles for The bay of pigs , Unfortunately , Kennedy fires Allen Dulles for Kennedy\u2019s own blunder. Kennedy also said that he was going to dismantle the CIA! Now that was the beginning of the end for a Kennedy . Although the CIA was in league with the mafia at the time because the mafia had land holdings and properties and casinos in Cuba and wanted it all back . Since Castro nationalized everything he wasn\u2019t going to give anything back . Enter the fbi ! J Edgar Hoover was owned by the Mafia because they knew Hoover was black and gay. That\u2019s right , at that time , if he was found out Hoover wouldn\u2019t have a job! Hoover always said , as ridiculous as it sounds \u201c that there is no organized crime in the US. \u201c Plus Hoover didn\u2019t like Kennedy , he kept a top secret file on Kennedy And his actions. Enter LBJ, LBJ was a criminal uncouth individual who had his hands dirty way before becoming vice-president , he hired a hit man by the name of Malcolm Wallace to take care of any business that a LBJ didn\u2019t want to do ( like kill people!). Malcolm (Mac) WallaceNow also consider that the Kennedy\u2019s owed the mafia a favor since Joseph Kennedy , JFK\u2019s father made a deal with Sam Giancana in Chicago to help with votes from unions . Giancana also helped funnel cash to buy votes and endorsements for the West Virginia Democratic primary election in May 1960.Also Frank Sinatra a supporter of Kennedy had a mob connection as well . Yes , I think this is pretty convoluted too! anyways Kennedy failed the CIA , he failed the Mafia and on top of that Robert Kennedy was constantly attacking the mob. Take all of this stew and stir it up and it spells assassination \u2026.this is just the tip of the ice berg , no kidding! By the way ,Oswald was telling the truth by telling the press that he was a \u201c Patsy\u201d! Oswald tried to get in touch with his FBI handler, Oswald was a low level FBI agent that was conveniently set up at the book depository. Oswald shared an office in Louisiana with Guy Bannister, William Guy Banister was an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, an Assistant Superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department, and a private investigator. The FBI office that they both worked in had two different addresses . But both doors went into the same office , one office door , the one that Oswald used , was used as a front for \u201c fair play for Cuba\u201d. The other was fbi - Guy Banister\u2019s door. Oswald and the Fair Play for Cuba Committee ",
