            "answer_text": "Nazi Germany\u2019s military was arguably one of the most technologically advanced fighting forces in the world during WW2, however its meal system was surprisingly old fashion. As the Germans advanced (or retreated) there was a long line of support vehicles/personal that made up the rear echelon, this included field kitchens. Nicknamed Gulaschkanone (Goulash Cannon) by the Germans because of its chimney, they were essentially huge wood/coal feed stoves & vats (usually horse-drawn). These mobile kitchens made almost everything a soldier would have in his daily diet: ( stew, soup, bread, coffee, etc ). The kitchens would be situated behind or near the frontline, units would then rotate through for their meals, if that wasn't possible runners would carry the meals in insulated containers to their units.  (German field kitchen)  (German troops dishing out their meals) The OKW (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht)(German High Command) prescribed each meal according to the soldier\u2019s branch, assignment, & theater of operations, so each meal varied. Also German troops were encouraged to \u201c live off the land\u201d, thus they took what they needed from the civilian population, again contributing to the varied meals. However here\u2019s a generalized menu a soldier on the front could expect: Breakfast: Bread with some type of spread ( animal fat, jam, honey, etc)Preserved meat ( hard sausage, canned meat, meat paste, etc )Ersatz (substitute) coffee, usually consisted of acorns, almonds, chicory, grain etc or anything similar that could be grounded up. Officers had greater access to real caffeinated coffee, but it was still a rare luxury.Lunch: Was the largest meal of the day & the only hot meal soldiers received from the field kitchen.Stew or soup consisting of some type of fresh vegetable ( potatoes, peas, beans, etc ) & fresh protein ( beef, pork, fish, etc). If no fresh vegetables were available pickled, canned, or scraps were utilized. If no protein was available animal fat, bone broth or canned meat was added as a substitute. Bread & coffee/coffee substitute would also accompany the meal when available.Here are some very detailed recipes: WWII German Ration RecipesDinner: Mainly consisted of leftovers from the day\u2019s past meals.Bread with cheese, spread, & maybe some type of preserved meat if available( sausage, meat paste etc ).Some type of sweets: ( condensed milk, powdered pudding, etc ). And of course coffee or ersatz coffee.  (German troops in various campaigns enjoying their meals) German troops also received a daily cigarette ration (6\u20137 cigarettes) and a small amount of alcohol when available ( beer, wine, schnapps, etc). Additionally fresh fruits & vegetables were given out when available. Overall the diet of a German soldier is pretty straightforward: bread, stew, coffee. However remember a soldier could take what he needed from the civilian population ( eggs, milk, fruit, etc ); soldiers could also purchase products & goods from vendors thus greatly varying their diet.  (Enjoying ice-cream in occupied Paris)  (Liberating melons from Russian farmers) I was going to finish off here since this is gettting pretty long, but what the heck read on if you\u2019re still interested. In addition to the meals field kitchens prepared the Wehrmacht also had something called \u201ciron rations\u201d, which came in 2 varieties. The first is called eiserne Portionen ( \u201cFull\u201d Iron Ration ), it was carried with the field kitchen wagons/vehicles & was meant to be used for emergencies only. If a field kitchen couldn\u2019t receive or forage for supplies to prepare the day\u2019s meals they would bust out their iron rations. Consisted of: Canned meat ( beef, pork, chicken, turkey, etc )Hard bread or crackersErbswurst ( pea soup )Coffee or coffee substituteSugar & salt (\u201cFull\u201d Iron Ration)   (Erbswurst) The second is the halb-eiserne Portion (Half Iron Ration). It was carried with soldiers in their packs & was meant to be consumed if they couldn\u2019t receive meals from a field kitchen. Consisted of only the canned meat & crackers/hard bread.  (Half Iron Ration) Lastly I ll talk about the Nahkampfp\u00e4ckchen and the Gro\u00dfkampfp\u00e4ckchen ( no idea what the translation is, sorry ). The Germans were very impressed by the American pre-packaged \u201cK\u201d rations, one lightweight box provided one varied meal ( unlike their own iron ration which was only meat & crackers ), thus the Nahkampfp\u00e4ckchen and Gro\u00dfkampfp\u00e4ckchen were born. The contents varied because of war time shortages & its late introduction, but it usually consisted of: BiscuitsFruit barsCandy ( hard candy, chocolate, etc )CigarettesThese packages were very popular with the troops because of the stimulants ( sugar & nicotine ), but also because it had much more variety compared to canned meat & crackers.   (Nahkampfp\u00e4ckchen and Gro\u00dfkampfp\u00e4ckchen) I know I probably missed some things, but the comments will point them out. ",

            "answer_text": "WWII rations are fairly well documented. Soldiers far from the front lines (in training camps, resting between missions, etc.) were fed from canteens that offered regular cooked foods of the type offered usually by military canteens (that is quite unpalatable but still not lacking nourishment). On the field there could be three different situations. In quieter sections of if the front line was well-established and not in fast movement, a field kitchen was built either from scrap materials (with some new, reusable materials brought in by the armies) like the British soldiers are doing in the first part of this film, some on wheels to be moved rapidly across the fields, like this soviet kitchen car (the interesting part starts at about minute 7). Usually what came out of these kitchens was stews of various types. Italian soldiers received pretty often minestrone soup with hardtack, sometimes spezzatino (a simple meat stew with tomato and vegetables) or similar hardy fare that could be cooked fairly fast and with a wide array of ingredients. Russian soldiers often got kulesh, a savory porridge with vegetables and meats, Germans would get gulash, etc.  In actions by them most armies offered packed rations like the infamous K rations, which included canned meats, hardtack, bouillon cubes, tea or coffee, candies (for fast energy) but also sigarettes and often alchool. In particular, the Soviet rations always incuded vodka: during the battle at Stalingrad rations were parachuted on the front lines in the city: while food rations were tied under the airplane and dropped with very little care, the alchool was launched from the cabin and with great care! Most commonly the rations were supplied with food that could be sourced and scrounged locally. This included buying, stealing, and estorting. While in friendly areas soldiers would be sometimes offered food from the local populatio, if they had any, or they could buy or barter food. While in enemy territory the most common way of sourcing food was simply estorting it with the brute strength fro the local population. In both cases, some stealing had to be kept into consideration. No army was above this kind of behavior: even the best fed armies (like the US\u2019) suffered from boring, uninspired food that kept you alive but didn\u2019t do much for the morale. So whenever they could find a way to add some tasty treat to their meals the soldiers took advantage of it. If a unit stumbled on an enemy farm, its livestock would quickly be turned into roast or stew for the soldiers. Also the pack animals (horses and mules) could, in case of necessity, be turned into food.  A final note on the various resistance forces. Partisans could not count on any kind of rations brought to them by any country. They usually relied on the population who gave them food. In Italy, and in other countries where there were strong partisan brigades too, those who offered food for the fighters were compensated with an IOU, usually crudely printed, bearing serial numbers and the signatures of the commander and of the political commissioner of the brigade. These IOU were later repaid by the republican government after the war. Most brigades like the Cichero in which my grandfather fought, all food and other goods were to be repaid this way. Even so, my grandfather remembers times when all they had to eat were a handful of dried chestnuts. In one instance the brigade held a fascist prisoner who complained that they were starving him, so my grandfather offeret to swap his meal with the fascist\u2019s: it was the same exact amount of dried chestnuts. Also, on August 27th 1944 (the day of his 19th birthday) my grandfather along with the rest of his unit was hiding from a large manhunt by the Nazis in a corn fiend and for two days all he had for food was still unripe corn.
