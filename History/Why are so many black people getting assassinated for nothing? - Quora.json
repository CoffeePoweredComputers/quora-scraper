            "answer_text": "why are you presuming that what you see on TV is fact? Also there arent many black people bring assassinated, there are a fair amount of black people being murdered but there are more than twice the number of white people being murdered but racially ifentifying them serves no purpose except to the media so they can say say he wasnt a man\u2026he was a black man.
