            "answer_text": "This was actually done twice; the first time by Diocletian in 285 when following multiple civil wars he decided to \u201ctry something else\u201d. His primary argument under the Tetriarchy was that Rome was a logistical nightmare. In that he wasn\u2019t wrong, but his solution was at best short sighted. Two wars of reunification would follow with Constantine and Julian the Apostate reuniting the Empire at various times for various stated reasons. Mostly because they could. The final division of the Empire happened following the death Theodosius I, who left the eastern half to one of his sons and the western half to another. Shortly thereafter the western half was besieged by a series of Barbarian invasions that finally ended in the sacking and destruction of Rome itself. There were also cultural differences: in the west they spoke Latin, in the east Greek. Differences in religion as to Christian sects permeated the situation.. It\u2019s been argued by many historians that dividing the empire actually saved the Eastern portion of the Empire rather than annihilating the West, but in terms of results I would suggest both are actually true. Rome itself had been and had become a rather massive welfare state. Also not \u201cproductive welfare\u201d which raised the economic standard of living but going back to Julius Cesar and before a grain dole to feed impoverished citizens became the norm and Rome had massive requirements on grain from Egypt (now belonging to the Eastern empire) in order to support it. There is an old adage about give a man a fish and he eats for a day teach him to fish and he eats for a lifetime. It created a permanent need to provide subsistence to nearly a million people in the Capital. For moral historians the juiciness of the story here is that slavery was a major factor in both the fall of the republic as well as the fall of the western empire. In the beginning only Romans who could afford their own weapons and armor were eligible for military service. That changed under the Marian reforms to include all Roman Citizens (which was not automatically conferred simply by living in the city). The Marian reforms were both incredibly successful and disastrous for Roman history. The reforms themselves were not a problem, essentially the guarantee was serve 20 years in the Roman Legion become a citizen and get a grant of land. The Roman Senate though would never actually vote land to veterans however it came as a personal gift from their general who was quite wealthy. The big problem here is now the armed troops who know how to fight are loyal to a man and not so much the state. Meanwhile for those who may have had no wish to fight slaves primarily from the east and northern Germanic tribes were the primary engine of labor for large land owners. That left a population without work and dependent upon government hand outs to eat. Subsistence is also not proper nutrition, you can\u2019t game hunt inside a city so over the centuries the able bodied military men in Rome atrophied and by the time of the Imperial division most of Roman military was actually composed of barbarian tribesman. Almost all the Barbarians who sacked Rome has actually at one point been in the Roman Legion or at least raised in Rome to wealthy families where they studied Roman military tactics. The Logistical argument is the stated reason but it\u2019s really somewhat of a canard. No doubt the Roman Emporer\u2019s who underook this believed it, but it was a symptom of the decay already well set into the bone rather than a true limitation. Rome had massive amounts of territory before it fell into decline. Messages took months but there was a system of effective chains of command there were able to administer provinces and govern the local peoples even into the Emperium. Some provinces were governed well some were not, but it was an important political career stepping stone. An important \u201caudition\u201d either for the role of Consul or for becoming Emperor. Had there not been this massive reliance on slave labor the gaps between the super-wealthy and the poor would not have become so violently exacerbated to the point that you needed a grain dole to avoid poor people rioting. Had you not had a grain dole and instead placed a system of education and career into the hands of the poor you would have had a more prosperous working class capable of providing necessary men and skilled labor. Had the Senate actually created a system for veterans that included land grants after 20 years Rome could have better populated its frontiers with men who knew how to fight and pacify a region but who were also loyal to the state rather than a man. No doubt some despots would have arisen but some would have never gotten off the ground (particularly the most foolish of them). Had the population not atrophied there would have been no or a very small need for Barbarian auxiliaries who ended up being the sackers of Rome. ",

            "answer_text": "This answer can be interpreted in 2 ways The splitting of the Roman Empire between 2 emperors, one for the west and one for the East in the 3rd centuryThe Western Roman Empire falling to barbarian invaders and the Eastern Roman Empire continuing onSplitting of Empire between Eastern and Western Emperors The Roman Empire encompassed almost 2 million square miles at the height of its power, controlling lands on 3 continents. Now imagine having the fastest mode of transportation being a horse which can race at 40 mph until it gets tired. Now imagine having to rule over such a vast land. Yeah probably not the greatest feeling in the world. But even at the high point of the Empire during Hadrian\u2019s rule, he realized the empire was to large to manage and ceded recently conquered lands of Dacia. After the Crisis of the 3rd Century, Emperor Diocletian decided to spilt the empire into the 4 halves to make it more manageable to rule. Following Diocletians death, the 4 halves of the empire remained until Constantine and Licinus took control of the other 2 halves, each ruling one half. Then, Constantine turned on Licinus, supposedly for his intolerance of Christianity, which Constantine converted to and both agreed to make the official religion, and eventually Constantine won and was the sole emperor of Rome. Fall of Western Roman Empire and Rise of the Eastern Roman Empire Constantine made much needed reforms but he couldn\u2019t keep the empire together after death. In the following century, Barbarian invaders like the Goths and Huns continued to ravage the empire. But the new capital of Constantinople in the East was a center of trade, commerce and politics, while Rome continually declined. The Eastern Roman Empire managed to either solve or minimize many of the problems that plagued the West like hyperinflation and Barbarian attacks. As a result, by 480 AD, the last Roman Emperor, the 15 year old Romulus Augustulus was overthrown by Odoacer, who declared himself, not Emperor, but King, signaling the end of the Western Roman Empire. But the East continued on as the Byzantine Empire (they still considered themselves the Eastern Roman Empire) until 1453 AD with the Fall of Constantinople. ",
