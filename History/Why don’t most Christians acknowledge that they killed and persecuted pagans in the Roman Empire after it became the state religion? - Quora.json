            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s talk about the persecution of pagans in ancient Rome. But first, a little background: Diocletian reigned from 284\u2013305. In 299, pagan augurs at the court of Diocletian make a string of failed predictions. They blame the Christians in the court for making the Sign of the Cross during the augury. Diocletian immediately orders the expulsion of all Christians from government service. Early in 303, Diocletian issues an order prohibiting Christians from assembling, depriving Christians of the right to bring accusations in court, and ordering that all Christian buildings or private homes containing Christian images be burnt to the ground. In one incident, as a church was being burnt, its unhappy patrons lined up to offer sacrifices as ordered. When the Christian deacon criticized them for being weak, the soldiers held him down and cut out his tongue. By the summer of 303, Diocletian ordered the imprisonment of Christian clergy and authorized the use of torture as a way to compel Christians to sacrifice to the gods. A few months later, instructions were given to kill any Christians who refused to offer sacrifices. In 304, Diocletian kicks it up a notch by ordering all inhabitants of the Roman Empire to offer sacrifices or face imprisonment, torture, or death. Diocletian retired in 305, leaving the Empire to his two successors, Galerius (East) and Constantius Chlorus (West). The persecutions enacted by Diocletian continue in the Eastern half of the Empire until 311, when Galerius ends them with a deathbed edit. The peace is short-lived, however, as Galerius\u2019 successor Maximinus renewed the persecution of Christians that same year, resuming the burning of churches and ordering that professing Christians be mutilated and/or disfigured. In 313, Maximinus killed himself, leaving his half of the Empire to Licinius. That same year, Constantine and Licinius meet in Milan, where Licinius tacitly recognizes Constantine as Augustus, and the two sign the Edict of Milan, which grants religious freedom throughout the Empire. Or so you would think. Licinius abided by the terms of the Edict of Milan for three years. However, in 316, he issued an edict expelling all Christians from government service. From 317\u2013320, he issued a series of edicts prohibiting Christians from meeting with the walls of any city, prohibiting Christian men and women from assembling together, etc. By 323, the persecution picks up. Christians who offer sacrifices are issued a certificate excusing them from persecution, while those who refuse to offer sacrifices are subject to imprisonment, confiscation of property, and in rare cases, physical torture. Licinius died in 324, leaving Constantine the sole Emperor. The next 13 years were relatively calm for both Christians and pagans. However, the Christians, you recall, endured a steady stream of vicious persecution for over 20 years straight, from 303 to 324. Following the death of Constantine in 337, his son Constantius II took over and offered the Christians the opportunity for retaliation. This they did, by allowing Constantius to shutter a handful of pagan temples, prohibiting the sacrifices that had been used as a litmus test for the renunciation of Christ, and removing a handful of pagan shrines. In 347, Theodosius became the Augustus of the West, and it was he who famously changed the Imperial cult from Roman paganism to Christianity. He also shuttered his own share of pagan temples, but as John Julius Norwich points out (Longer History of Byzantium), lack of attendance was the criteria for temple closure. Theodosius was also careful to pack up pagan statues and store them for posterity, rather than throwing them away or smashing them wantonly. That\u2019s pretty it. That last sentence expresses the full extent of malicious, Christian vengeance against the pagans for 20 years of torturing, killing, mutilating, burning, and pillaging Christian men, women, and children. Constantius II died in 361, and his successor was a former Christian named Julian, nicknamed by history as \u201cthe Apostate.\u201d Julian was a zealous pagan who reinstituted the sacrifices, reopened the temples that had been closed, and restored the pagan shrines. He is not known as a fierce persecutor of Christians, but he wasn\u2019t shy about showing his utter disgust for the Christian religion. Ultimately, however, his pagan reforms fell on deaf ears. He tried for two years to drum up enthusiasm for the old religion, but by that time, paganism was largely viewed as an antiquated, rural superstition. Julian reopened the temples, but nobody bothered to show up. In 363, Julian was speared by a Parthian on the battle field, and according to contemporary accounts, his last words were, \u201cGalilean, thou hast triumphed.\u201d That was, more of less, the last gasp of Roman paganism. Individual pagans persisted for several more centuries, generally without persecution. A few pagan temples remained in Constantinople by the 10th century. As late the 15th century, a worshiper of the Olympian gods was regarded as the foremost expert on Plato, and Christian bishops not only consulted him for information on philosophy, they also brought him to theological debates as a subject matter expert.

            "answer_text": "Christians who are real Christians, who believe and accept the gospel of Yahshua (Jesus), repent from their sins, and have His Spirit within them don\u2019t normally kill and slaughter anyone. There are many Christians, past and present, who have that label because it is politically advantageous for them, to make money, to have a position and status, and power over others. So, not doing any of the things listed above that make an actual Christian, they stick a cross on themselves, usually with some gaudy, clown-like costume, and then go out and kill or rape or whatever, thinking that these decorations have any real meaning at all. Now we have people running around even today, claiming that \u201cChristians\u201d did this or that, they HAD to be \u201cChristians\u201d, see, they stuck a CROSS on themselves, they MUST be a \u201cChristian\u201d. This started basically with the Emperor Constantine, who pretended to convert to \u201cChristianity\u201d for political reasons and advantages, pretended to see a cross in the sky and pretended to hear a voice telling him to kill in His name, supposedly Jesus. So he stuck a cross on himself (and his soldiers) and went and killed in Jesus\u2019 name. since then, many thousands of people stuck crosses on themselves and went out and did crazy and stupid things, and people are like, they MUST be Christians! see the cross! This is foolish, but people do it all the time. Also keep in mind that no Christian can, or should, have to answer for people like this. The average atheist today, for example, should not be made to \u201cadmit\u201d and \u201cexplain\u201d what atheist killers have done. Lastly, pagans had no problem whatsoever killing Christians, too. Perhaps they should admit that. It is a sad aspect of human nature that violence begets more violence and it escalates, then those that write history make it sound like one side was innocent and the other guilty. Yahshua (Jesus) said you will know true followers of Him by their \u201cfruits\u201d or behavior, not a cross. ",
