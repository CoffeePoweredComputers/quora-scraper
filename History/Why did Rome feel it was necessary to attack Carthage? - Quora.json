            "answer_text": "The answer varies depending on whether you're referring to the first punic war or the third. In the first case, the decision to attack Syracuse in defense of Messina was made by the Roman people after the debate in the Senate proved unfruitful in bringing to a resolution in favor or against the war. In this case there were many factions interested in extending Roman influence to Sicily (thus breaking a previous treaty they stipulated with Carthage forbidding the Romans from setting foot on the island): Sicily was exceptionally rich and fertile. This appealed to the lower classes.Roman merchants were ever in search for new markets where to operate and they jumped on a fine occasion to cut better deals in Sicily while simultaneously \u201csticking it\u201d to their carthaginian rivals.The Senate didn't look particularly favourably to the prospect of a stronger Carthaginian hold over Sicily, nor did they fancy Syracusan expansion toward the strait. The reasons the assembly didn't declare war immediately were a certain disdain towards the mercenaries controlling Messana at the time and concern over the exhaustion of roman forces after the costly war against Pyrrhus. Also, Rome didn't have a fleet at the time.The Third Punic War was nothing more than the gratuitous destruction of a defeated enemy using a flimsy casus belli and displaying the most egregious example of imperialism. Or so it seems. The truth is, the Romans were understandably afraid of a possibile resurgence of Carthaginian power. The first time they defeated Carthage they left the city bankrupt and facing a mercenary revolt that cost them Sardinia and Corsica as well as Sicily. Even so in a few years they were able not only to recover but to wage war against Rome and inflict the Romans the worst defeats in their history. Hannibal's rampage in the italian peninsula caused the death of more than 100\u2032000 soldiers, Romans and socii, and the destruction of many cities and harvests in southern Italy. The only reason Rome didn't fall then was the lack of siege equipment and the successful operation undertaken by both the navy and the army (under consuls Tiberius Claudius Nero and Marcus Claudius Marcellus) to isolate Hannibal, wear him down in small engagements and prevent him from receiving any reinforcements. You can see why many Romans didn't feel safe knowing that Carthage was again given the chance to recover, albeit under harsher condition than those imposed after the first punic war. Cato the Censor, the senator famous for his habit of ending every speech with the sentence \u201cceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam\u201d regardless of what he was talking about up to that point (tr. \u201cas for the rest, I believe Carthage must be destroyed\u201d), famously brought a crate of ripe figs imported from Carthage into the Senate, to make the point that if a crate containing notoriously fragile fruit could make the trip from Carthage to Rome, then the enemy was way too close for comfort. Furthermore, the land Carthage still held in North Africa was incredibly fertile at that time. So the Romans declared war when Carthage reacted to Massinissa's aggression and the city was destroyed after 3 years of siege, and this time for good. ",

            "answer_text": "Rome was hesitant to go to war with Carthage at first. They were very well aware of their naval power. Rome was at that time regional Italian power. The dispute came over the mamertines. Mamertines were Campanian mercenaries that lived in Sicily. They took the city of Messena and lived there for some years. Messena was besieged by Syracuse and the mamertines appealed for help from Carthage that had at that time fleet anchored in their harbor. They felt uncomfortable under the Carthaginian protection so they appealed for support from fellow Italians - Rome. Romans saw Carthage as a direct threat on their borders and eventually the First Punic War erupted. ",
