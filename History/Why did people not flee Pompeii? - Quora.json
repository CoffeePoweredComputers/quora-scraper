            "answer_text": "People did flee Pompeii. We focus on the dead, especially the poignant plaster casts. However, little is made of the fact that compared to the overall number of people estimated to have been living in Pompeii at the time of the eruption, the percentage of the dead is low. The eruption didn\u2019t start out especially dangerous in a manner that made people want to flee right away. They sheltered first. Only as the hours passed, and the eruption increased intensity did people consider evacuating. The roofs of buildings were collapsing under the weight of ash, pumice and lapilli. The first people to die in Pompeii were killed in the buildings that collapsed on them. They turned up as bones thousands of years later. People eventually left Pompeii in different directions. This group was dubbed \u201cThe Garden of the Fugitives\u201d as they were found near the top of the ash layers burying Pompeii. They were likely caught by the pyroclastic flow able to move through Pompeii after the previous flows had stopped at the city walls. It has since been shown to be the medium that was necessary to create the natural mold that was used to create the eerie and tragic plaster casts of the dead.  This link goes to a report about how people reacted to the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79: The eruption of Vesuvius of 79 AD and its impact on human environment in Pompeii This opens a new avenue of discussion relating to the people fleeing Pompeii: what happened to them? At first blush we would assume they all got away and survived, but that likely isn\u2019t correct. Pompeii stood on a high promontory at the mouth of the Sarno River where it emptied into the Bay of Naples. Some archaeological work has established that there was a working port there, but we have little information about it. This first link touches lightly on the first ideas that Pompeii likely stood near a lagoon where the Sarno River entered the Bay of Naples. https://www.pompeiiinpictures.com/pompeiiinpictures/Temples/SancALocCBottaro.htm This next link to a study to reconstruct the likely geography of the Sarno River Plain makes for fascinating reading. It shows that Pompeii stood on a sloping promontory overlooking a lagoon. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241321875_Revised_modeling_of_the_post-AD_79_volcanic_deposits_of_Somma-Vesuvius_to_reconstruct_the_pre-AD_79_topography_of_the_Sarno_River_plain_Italy It might be fair to assume some people fleeing Pompeii would have made their way to the port, hoping to escape. This was the same situation at Herculaneum. Herculaneum was long thought to have been largely deserted early on during the eruption until the beachfront galleries were excavated in the 1980s. The sheer mass of humanity discovered rewrote what we thought we knew about Herculaneum almost overnight. Beyond the port, Pompeii was in a coastal plain with many farms, villas and hamlets. There was an extensive network of roads in the area. Descriptions predating the eruption noted that the whole arc of the Bay of Naples resembled a city as there were so many buildings from end to end along the shoreline. People escaping Pompeii likely took refuge in other places, thinking they were safer. These wall paintings found at Pompeii, Oplontis and Stabiae are more like fantasy architecture themes, but they would not be far from what people would have seen from the water. The last is a fantasy harbor that might hint at what Pompeii had.    Many people likely assumed they\u2019d be returning to their homes and businesses once the eruption was over since they sometimes left valuables. A baker would have needed his donkeys to help grind the grain. A wealthy elite would not have wanted to risk his home being burglarized in the eruption so he\u2019d have left his unfortunate dog chained at the entrance to his villa. As others have said, pyroclastic flows were unknown. Fleeing people had to stop somewhere to rest and shelter, hoping they\u2019d be safe until the worst was past. But they would have been within range of the awesome angel of death that came roaring downslope from Vesuvius early the next day. The consensus of archaeologists and volcanologists is that most Pompeii\u2019s dead are outside the city, under the homes, businesses, and infrastructure on the Sarno River plain of today. As the linked paper below noted: 9.2. Survival rate Attempting to estimate the survival rate of the eruption is not a secondary matter, if we want to quantify its impact. Unfortunately, as previously reported, the exact number of inhabitants at the time of the eruption is still uncertain: considering the estimates reported above, it is possible to calculate that probably 75^92% of the residents escaped the town at the first signs of the crisis. But, based on the available data, it is not possible to know how successful those fugitives were, mainly because of the quickly thickening fallout pumice deposit on the streets and the countryside; probably, as shown by the hundred victims recovered from the relatively small excavations outside the city walls, many of them were killed. A link to an informative paper about the recovered dead at Pompeii and some conclusions drawn from them: http://pages.mtu.edu/~raman/papers2/Luongo1JVGR.pdf But on the flip side, there were also survivors. A careful second look at old excavation reports has revealed that looters visited the ruins of Pompeii and other locations after the eruption. Parts of Pompeii might have still been visible. People who\u2019d previously lived there might have been able to work out roughly where their homes and valuables were and tunneled down to them. Many more ordinary items have survived at Pompeii, but oddly not very much of the luxurious or especially artistically valuable material when compared to Herculaneum. There are also records of tax collections being suspended, courts being set up to deal with the estates of the deceased and relief efforts in the area. Frustratingly, they are brief and give no detail. Perhaps the survivors stayed in the general area? The names of places like Pompeii persisted for centuries after they\u2019d been buried and lost. They could still be found on Roman maps. The name of Pompeii corrupted to La Civitas. That name was given to a hill above the Sarno River that was rumored to be the location of a buried town, but nobody knew for sure. That hill would eventually be revealed to be the highest point in ancient Pompeii, roughly where the forum and the nucleus of the old city was first built. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, lots of people did - and because they got away we don\u2019t find them in the ruins. The populations of Pompei and Herculaneum were in the tens of thousands and relatively few \u201cbodies\u201d have been discovered. Other people fled to what they expected to be safe shelter - hundreds were killed huddled together in groups in the port area of Herculaneum where they had sheltered in a series of semi underground rooms. Women and Children predominate in those groups and one theory is that the men were on the beach trying to secure boats to evacuate their families. They were overcome by pyroclastic flows - which are A) extremely hot and b) move very very fast - none of the occupants had probably observed a pyroclastic flow so would have had no conception as to the danger they were in. Hidden in unlit cellars they quite possibly wouldnt have realised how bad it was getting outside. Even today a pyroclastic flow into a populated are would be devastating - we can\u2019t predict them with any degree of certainty. Some would have had significant wealth tied up in the town - so would be reluctant to leave and would have trusted in the strength of their well built homes until it was too late. They had lived with the volcano for ever and for the most part it was a genial if grumpy neighbour. They had recovered from a significant earthquake a few years before and many no doubt assumed that \u201cit wouldnt be that bad\u201d. People do exactly the same now even if provided with very fulsome and accurate warnings - look how many people refuse to evacuate in the face of a Hurricane warning. ",
