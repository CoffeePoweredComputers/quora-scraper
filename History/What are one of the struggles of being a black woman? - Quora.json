            "answer_text": "People judge you when they first see you based on stereotypes-you are either a low income single mother, you work a pink collar job, or you are \"sassy\", or you are loud. People are always surprised when then find out I'm an engineer with a Master's degree, don't have kids, speak standard English without a \"black\" accent, am not particularly loud, and like classical music-I'm not supposed to like those things, I guess. Your social life can be challenging-there aren't many eligible black men around, and it is worse if you are educated. And men from other races in general will not date you-either because they don't find black women as a rule attractive, or it doesn't occur to them to give black women a chance. Dating sites pretty much confirm this-black women garner the least amount of responses out of all races of women. So, you are kind of between a rock and a hard place, and your self esteem can take a beating. You do not feel part of the mainstream. Movies and TV and other media don't really give black women the attention that white women get, we seem to be invisible to the media. You don't see a lot of shows that reflect your life or experiences or have people that look like you. I'm probably a little more sensitive to this because I am an amateur performer and audition for musical theater productions-when looking at an audition notice, I have to bear in mind that I may not get cast because I'm not white, and don't have the \"look\" the director may want. Friends of mine get cast far easier-and I think part of that is because they are white. Which sucks-I can always sing better by practicing than I did six months ago, but I can't be any less black than I was six months ago. Of course, on the job-I work in a white male dominated field, and I think that my career would have been a lot better if I had been a man. I think women, especially black women, have to be careful about being outspoken in the office-it is very easy to be labeled \"not a team player\" or \"difficult\" or some such for activity that a man would never get labeled for. And because you don't \"look\" like someone's idea of a manager or leader, it's harder to get promoted-which is not only frustrating, you feel cheated-that's money out of my pocket. ",

            "answer_text": "I have carved out a pretty good life for my two children and I. Honestly, most of my struggles were due to the choices that I made early on in life and has less to do with me being a black female, despite the fact that I grew up in a dysfunctional environment. I made poor decisions and then I begin to realize that no matter how horrendous, challenging or painful my childhood was, I am still responsible for the outcome of my life. Hence, accountability. As such, I had to change my narrative and rewrite my story. My upbringing led me down a path of delinquency which resulted in me being a high school drop out and a teenage mother. However, when I had my son he was the turning point in my life, the catalyst to change. The first time I looked into his eyes I knew that he deserved the best that life had to offer. As such, I knew that I had to change my legacy. I enrolled into school and I pursued my BA degree in sociology and psychology, a master's degree in social work and a PsyD. I have been extremely successful in my field as evidenced by the various careers that having an education has afforded me to have. Additionally, I wrote a few books and purchased a home as a single mother. Needless to say, my journey has been incredible. I have exceeded my expectations. Granted, my life as previously stated, has had many struggles and challenges, such as an abusive childhood, followed by an abusive marriage which led to a painful divorce, just to name a few. I had to overcome numerous obstacles. However, the issues that I have encountered in my opinion are more universal and has less to do with my race and gender. Of course there are times in which I have encountered stereotypes. However, in some of those instances it was my own black male and female counterparts who stereotyped me. I have also encountered microaggression, but nothing life altering as a result of the aforementioned encounters. Mostly, I am proud to be a black woman. I believe that everyone's life is different and that everyone has a purpose. My primary purpose for being on this earth is to be of service to others, to help people who are hurting,and those who are in need. I take a great deal of pride in being who I am and I choose to be a survivor and not a victim. In essence my black female struggles are universal. As many people have had similar life experiences. However, I am a firm believer that it is not about what happens to you in life, but how you respond. Each time that life has knocked me down I get back up again. I am a survivor, I won't give up I am going to work harder. ",
