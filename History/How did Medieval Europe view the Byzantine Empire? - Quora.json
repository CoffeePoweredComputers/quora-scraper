            "answer_text": "Really weirdly. So first Medieval Europe refers to over 1000 years so things change quite a bit over that time. At first (like early middle ages) Europe saw the Byzantines as the Romans- with all the power and glory that goes along with that Eventually, though the Catholic Church wanted to be the Roman Empire. So the church created the \u201cHoly Roman Empire\u201d and itself became the \u201cRoman Catholic Church\u201d thus cementing their \u201cRoman-ness\u201d in the eyes of Europeans. There was an enormous prestige that went along with being the Roman Empire and the church knew this. They would be damned if the rivalling greeks were going to steal all the glory! The Crusades complicate everything. By this point, the Byzantine Empire was referred to as the \u201cGreek Kingdom\u201d by the church and there was hostility. This was all set aside during the 1st crusade though and for a while, relations warmed up a bit. But as the Crusades went on Byzantine opinions of the Europeans changed quite a bit. They were tired of these barbarians storming onto their lands and disrupting their relations with the Islamic empires. The crusaders themselves were always hostile and destructive towards the Byzantines and pretty soon we saw Byzantine troops attacking crusaders. After multiple failed crusades the church (and all Europe) began blaming the Byzantine empire for their failures. This all came to ahead in the 4th crusade when the crusaders sacked the city of Constaninople- and this pretty much spelled the end for the Byzantine Empire. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends largely upon the time and place. The Medieval Era spans roughly 1000 years, and opinions of the Eastern Roman Empire, or Basileia Rhomaion to its inhabitants, changed drastically over the period. In the \u201cDark Ages,\u201d roughly 500 - 800 CE, everyone in Europe saw the Byzantine Empire for what it truly was: the continuation of the Roman Empire of Antiquity. Byzantine citizens were considered Romans by themselves and everyone else until the 9th century. As has been eloquently proven in many previous answers to this question, the Byzantine capital of Constantinople was the primary (and after 476 CE, sole) capital of the Roman Empire before and after the fall of the Western provinces. The inhabitants of Western Europe did not forget this; until Charlemagne, no western ruler had the gall to call himself a Roman Emperor so long as the real deal resided in Constantinople. Even then, Charlemagne was only able to claim the title in 800 CE because the current ruler of the Empire was, for the first and only time, a woman \u2014 Eirene of Athens. Salic law did not recognize women as legitimate claimants to sovereignty, so the title of Roman Emperor was, from Charlemagne\u2019s point of view, up for grabs. The Pope of Rome, who at this point was still recognized as the primary (if not all-powerful) authority in both Eastern and Western Chalcedonian Christianity, concurred and agreed to preside over Charlemagne\u2019s coronation as (Holy) Roman Emperor. From this point on, with the blessing of the Catholic Church, most of the Christian peoples of Western Europe considered the heirs of Charlemagne, not the actual Emperors in Constantinople, to be the legitimate occupiers of the Imperial throne. They slowly but surely began calling the empire based in Constantinople the Empire of the Greeks. The Eastern Empire, which was predominantly Greek in both language and ethnicity, wholeheartedly rejected this appellation and continued to call themselves Romaioi until the end of the Empire and beyond. The situation was much different in Eastern Europe \u2014 and everywhere else, for that matter. The European lands that were under the influence of the Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople, along with all the Muslim powers of the Near East, continued to refer to the residents of the \u201cByzantine\u201d Eastern Empire as Romans and the Empire itself as Rhomania. If you had told anyone living east of Poland or south of Hungary that Constantinople was not Roman, they would have laughed and/or punched you in the face. This division continued until the disastrous Sack of Constantinople in 1204 CE during the Fourth Crusade. After this point, few outside the Greek-speaking heartlands of Greece and western Anatolia considered the reconstituted Byzantine rump state to be the heir of Rome in any politically meaningful sense. It must be said, however, that the areas that were ethnically Greek continued to be culturally Roman in the eyes of the East for several centuries more, until the late 19th century. Some Greeks still refer to themselves as Romans in 2019, though few others consider them to be so. ",
