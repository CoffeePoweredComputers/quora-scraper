            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll get to a speculative timeline soon, but first, it\u2019s important that we clarify terms. What do we mean by \u201cextinct\u201d? Nowadays, when we say that Neanderthals went extinct, we no longer mean that Neanderthals left no living descendants. That is now an unsupportable claim. Most humans carry segments of DNA inherited from Neanderthal ancestors[1]who mixed with populations entering Eurasia from Africa between 47,000 and 65,000 years ago.[2]This mixing was so thorough that one cannot find a modern person with significant non-African ancestry who does not have Neanderthal genes. Since 47,000 years ago was long before the identical ancestors point,[3]the mixed couples\u2019 genealogical descent includes all Africans as well. While not everyone has Neanderthal genes\u2014presence of them is merely an indicator of concentration of ancestry\u2014Neanderthal ancestry is universal for humans. The same is true for our descent from other \u2018archaic\u2019 human populations who have left genetic evidence that is concentrated regionally. So our timeline has to be one where there are people who are at least \u201cmostly Neanderthal\u201d in ancestry. What we do mean by \u201cNeanderthals went extinct\u201d is that Neanderthals ceased being a distinct population of humans. So our scenario has to be one where either: 1) The main ancestral population of Homo sapiens in Africa went extinct first, thus was never able to mix with Neanderthals, 2) Neanderthals never mixed with H. sapiens leaving Africa because they couldn\u2019t interbreed, 3) Neanderthals never mixed with H. sapiens leaving Africa because they wouldn\u2019t interbreed, or 4) The mixing did occur, as in our timeline, but a surviving population with mostly Neanderthal genes survived in some isolated location that H. sapiens didn\u2019t reach. Timeline 1 is extremely different from our own history. We don\u2019t know enough about Neanderthals to know how they would have developed if the main H. sapiens branch just didn\u2019t exist. I\u2019ll leave this one for a more imaginative person. Timeline 2 is impossible. Neanderthals who were sufficiently distant from H. sapiens to not be able to breed would not be our timeline\u2019s Neanderthals. Timeline 3 is impossible and funny. The only way this would be possible is if Neanderthals had united into a nation-state with a navy effective enough to defend the entire species frontier from Gibraltar to Yemen, then successfully prosecute a 65,000-year war. Uh, no\u2026 Timeline 4 is what we have to go with. Some \u201cpure\u201d-ish Neanderthals find a refuge in a relatively distant island, and H. sapiens don\u2019t bother them there. This can\u2019t be too close to mainland Eurasia. Places like Britain and Ireland are far too close to be isolated, let alone defended. I propose New Zealand, as it was one of the last places H. sapiens reached. Yes, I know that New Zealand is very far from the area where Neanderthals lived, but this isn\u2019t a very likely timeline in the first place. Let\u2019s say that it\u2019s 100,000 years ago. The easternmost known population of Neanderthals\u2014those who were mixing with Denisovans in the Altai Mountains, had descendants who migrated much farther east\u2014into Siberia, across to Sakhalin. There, still living in cold weather, they learn how to do boats. They hunt and fish their way down to Japan, the Ryukyus and Taiwan, and then take the same historical path out of Taiwan that the ancestors of the Polynesians later would in our timeline. The Neanderthals make it to New Zealand by 80,000 years ago, extinct the poor flightless birds much earlier than in our timeline, and wait. They still prefer to live in much smaller bands, more spread out than the Sapiens, so they don\u2019t become a big enough population to remain much of a factor in mainland Eurasia. The Sapiens still spread, as in OTL (our timeline), mix with the Neanderthals of West Asia and Europe, and also settle East Asia and its neighbouring island archipelagos as in OTL\u2014except there are Neanderthals on a few of the islands. New mixing events occur up to about 25,000 years ago throughout Australasia and Oceania. But they miss New Zealand, not only until well into historical times, but until the rise of gunpowder empires. Due to the butterfly effect, these will be vastly different human cultures, so I won\u2019t speculate as to their cultural characteristics. However, for the purposes of the story, make them similar to 18th century Europeans. The Neanderthals in New Zealand are still, probably, close enough genetically that Sapiens and Neanderthals can produce fertile children. Remember that these Sapiens, like us, mixed with some of the Neanderthals, and more recently. However, the settlers of New Zealand don\u2019t want to, because of racism probably. With vast technological differences, the fate of these Neanderthals is, sadly, likely to be genocide. Unless, by chance, \u201cdiscovery\u201d is delayed until the discovering people have fully accepted a view on human rights that is more advanced than what people broadly accept today\u2014definitely, our analogues to 18th century Europeans won\u2019t avoid it. The surface-level changes will surely be vast, but impossible to predict. What it will change is the development of the \u201cspecies\u201d concept in evolutionary biology, and the development of the scientific literature surrounding human difference. That looks vastly different.

            "answer_text": "Ignore the other answers, Neanderthal men (Homo neanderthalensis) is an extinct specie. Only a part of modern human (Homo sapiens) DNA matches that of the Neanderthals. Although it's is theorizied by many anthropologists that the DNA came from the result of hybridization between some sub-populations of Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons (our direct ancestors), there's no conclusive evidence to back that theory yet. The DNA could simply be the result of shared ancestory between humans and Neanderthals, since both species originated from common ancestors. Now, as for your question, if Neanderthal people didn't go extinct, assuming they didn't get hunted down to extinction in the middle ages by humans, they would've become a feared, ignored, isolated and uncivilized race found in some parts of Europe. Our culture would've developed differently since the medieval and middle age Europeans had to keep them isolated and learned how not to get in trouble with them. Neanderthals lacked the intelligence to form a civilization like modern humans and many of them were cannibals as well, so it's fair to assume that their life would've been similar to those of some of the uncivilized populations of lost native Americans living in the amazon, the sentinelese from the Andaman Islands, and many tribes of New Guinea etc. They would've been modern day cavemen.
