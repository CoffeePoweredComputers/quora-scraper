            "answer_text": "Being a good wife and a good mother. Those are the highest achievements I have and hope to continue. I have been told by numerous individuals including my husband that I am a good wife and a good mother. I send my daughter to the best private school possible and I would love to send my stepchildren there but that is not up to me it is up to my husband\u2019s ex-wife and she does not agree. I spend time with my child every day and we are extremely open. I have taught her from age 6 that if she makes a mistake and she comes to me first she will not get in trouble the first time. If it happens again, and she tells me first, she will be in less trouble. She is extremely comfortable talking with me about her body changes as well as boys. She is only 11 but I hope this will continue throughout her life. She has openly said that she likes to talk to me about these things because she knows I will not talk to anyone else and she cannot count on the children at her school to keep the secrets. As far as being a wife, I am constantly asking my husband what I can do to improve. I make sure to satisfy every need he has. There is nothing too small that he could request for me to do. He provides for our family the most. He is a wonderful man so I strive to be a wonderful wife. We have great communication and I choose not to be a nagging wife and I don\u2019t constantly bring up the past. If I ask him to do something and he doesn\u2019t I do not get angry. Marriage isn\u2019t about who goes to the grocery store. We fight rarely and when we do we are able to fix it within a matter of minutes because we stop what we are doing and communicate. I refuse to be a wife that nags or complains when he is not abusive or a liar. I encourage all who are married to ask their partners what they could do to improve their marriage. You\u2019d be surprised on the answers and how simple it could be. ",

            "answer_text": "Erik was born gorgeous. At sixteen, Erik had long blonde hair, a smile that could melt the coldest of hearts and a body the Gods were jealous of. Erik represents perfection in my eyes.  My brother Erik and I were raised by a single mom, our Mom. My Mom has four sisters and countless female cousins. That gave Erik and I a very deep appreciation for the challenges all single parents face. Erik is my only sibling and younger brother by two years and nine months. At forty years old the small age gap no longer matters. At eleven years old it made all the difference in the world.  Born into dysfunction and raised by a parent who struggled with addiction, we found ourselves exposed to adult problems, often. Mom's boyfriends were what we swore we'd never become. The first time we fought back, Erik was nine. Garrett took a shot at Mom in our kitchen. I was next on the hit list and fell easily. Before he could raise his hand the third time, Erik charged from the back door straight towards him. My kid brother lifted a six foot man, that I thought was going to kill me, up into the air and launched him through two pantry doors. That would be a turning point in the lives of two brothers. One by one, in short order, we would take Mom's boyfriends out and keep her single for years. If my instigation and manipulation wasn't enough to chase them away, Erik used brute force. We were a formidable team. Our blood ties and history made our relationship strong, unbreakable. Throughout our teens and twenties we did everything together. Every job we worked was together. We lived together and dated sisters together. We thought our way through troubles and when that didn't work, well, brute force did.  Yes, Erik is a holding a monkey!  Erik was and is the man I most admire. He is part of me and we are part of each other. We started shooting dope together somewhere in our twenties. Two or three years ago, we were both trying to kick. I invited him over to my apartment one afternoon to plan a birthday party for our Mom. We talked, had a nice dinner and just caught up. Trying to kick dope and kicking dope are different. Trying means we were still shooting, but knew it wouldn't last forever. We cop'd a few bags and made arrangements for him to stay the night. We each shot a bag and I watched as the life drained from his face. His bright beautiful smile slowly fell as he slumped forward. I knew what was happening. At that point I had plenty of experience with death. I didn't panic in the sense that I was frozen, but I was certainly scared. I checked for a pulse that I knew wasn't going to be there. I called 911 immediately and began CPR. It was almost ten minutes until rescue personal would arrive. When I was relieved by med-techs, I broke down in tears. Erik was taken to Pottstown Memorial Hospital and I was right there with him. After about six hours, Erik came to. He knew he had overdosed in my apartment. Erik never shot up again. I was and am so proud of him. The police interviewed him while he was in the hospital and told him what had happened, that I had saved his life. Last year I quit shooting dope and we finally talked about what happened that night. I told him that saving his life was the best thing I ever did. He slowly cracked that beautiful smile, the one he has me to thank for, and said, \u201cI kicked Garrett\u2019s ass when he tried to kill you, guess we\u2019re finally even.\u201d I couldn't believe it! My little brother still putting my ass in check. Leon ",
