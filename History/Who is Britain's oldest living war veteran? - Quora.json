            "answer_text": "Note: the original question was something like \u201cWho was Britain\u2019s oldest living revolutionary war veteran?\u201d If your question refers to the United States\u2019s Revolutionary War then, by slightly changing the Rules of Engagement\u2026err, the question\u2026.I can come up with a good one for you. Royal Naval junior officer Provo Wallis was 21 years old when, during the War of 1812 and serving on the HMS Shannon, it captured the USS Chesapeake off Boston. During that action the Shannon\u2019s captain was injured and its first lieutenant killed. This advanced Wallis to become temporary captain as it sailed back to its Halifax, Nova Scotia base. At this time (and since 1688 and until some time after World War One), a British naval officer, upon reaching by merit the rank of Post Captain (equal either to Commander or Captain in the US Navy, depending on certain criteria), would continue to climb the ranks of officers no longer by merit, but simply and solely by staying alive as the upper ranks diminished by superior officers\u2019 deaths. Last One Standing, as it were, at any one time, is the Admiral of the Fleet. And Sir Provo William Parry Wallis spent the next many decades avoiding both being killed in action or in bed and was still on the Active List, as the grand old Admiral of the Fleet (which he achieved in 1875), until finally perishing in 1892, one month before completing his 101st year. So: while not the US\u2019s Revolutionary War per se, that conflict we call the War of 1812 was in fact the true finale of the parting of the colonies from England (thanks, Paul H) - and Sir Provo was the oldest officer, likely the oldest warrior, and with uttermost certainty the oldest active duty! sailor or soldier from that time. By the way, fide Wikipedia, Sir Provo was enlisted at the ripe age of Four (not uncommon practice at the time) in 1795. So: Ninety Seven years a sailor!!!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWas,\u201d not \u201cis.\u201d Because they are all dead, you know. So past tense. I rather doubt anyone can identify the longest-lived British veteran of the American War of Independence, records being rather sparse back then. Besides, he might have been a Hessian. But perhaps some Quoran has a contact at the Horse Guards who could blow the dust off the regimental records and identify a few candidates. Any takers? ",
