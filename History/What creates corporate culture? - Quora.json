            "answer_text": "Short answer: Vision, Values, People, Rituals, Story, Background. Long answer: I\u2019ve run through all the previous answers and wasn\u2019t able to find someone with a clear vision of what company culture is. That\u2019s quite a common problem. Even board members of enterprise-level companies may not know exactly how to define corporate culture. The reason for that is the unique path every company goes through before creating a comprehensive company culture. I believe there is no benchmark you can use to create your culture. Even if there is one and you use it - it won\u2019t be YOUR culture. That is why \u201cbest practices\u201d won\u2019t work here. However, it is possible to outline some main elements that form company culture. I\u2019ve listed them in the short version of this answer, now it\u2019s time to give you more context. Vision This is the backbone of your team. Vision determines why does your company exist and where it is going. That is the \u201cU\u201d part of your USP, it is what makes you different from your competitors. This is what makes you get out of bed every morning. This is the impact you want to deliver. Such existential features cannot be figured out during one brainstorm session. However, answering the \u201cWhat is our ultimate goal?\u201d question might help. Values While Vision is general and focused on the exterior goal, Values in something focused on internal climate. Values describe the employee behaviors and mindset required to achieve the company vision. Together, the vision and values serve as guidelines for how employees are expected to lead, behave, and communicate. People This one is simple. People are carriers of your company culture. They are the ultimate measure of whether your culture works. They are the engine that drives your company whether towards your Vision or in the opposite direction. When hiring a team - you should always consider employees\u2019 skills and personal traits. If they are not aligned with your Vision or Values - your collaboration won\u2019t last. Rituals Rituals are the perfect measure of whether people\u2019s behavior is aligned with company culture or not. Rituals determine: how your employees communicate (both with each other and with clients),how the work gets done,how they spend their leisure (if there are any common activities besides work),how the teamwork is evaluated and whether it is recognized at all.Story You are probably aware of this one. It has become a buzzword for the last two years. There even are hundreds of consultants eager to \u201chelp you tell your story\u201d, \u201cshare your story\u201d and even create one. To my mind - you don\u2019t need anyone to help you with that. Your company is building its story on a daily basis. If it\u2019s not articulated yet - just take your time. Good stories are not born in a second. Background Basically, this one is the environment in which people do their work, collaborate, and make decisions. For example, geographic regions tend to attract different kinds of companies and employees, as in the case of the Bay Area for tech firms. Now, when you\u2019re aware of the most crucial components, it must be easier for you to articulate your own company culture. Feel free to comment! ",

            "answer_text": "It starts with the founder and who they initially hire. As the company grows and hires more people, there becomes these pockets of influence in the company that shapes who the company becomes. It\u2019s not necessarily the CEO who shapes the culture. It can be anyone inside the company. I was in one company where there was a senior admin who was so admired, that she alone was the most influential person in the company and had a huge impact on the company culture. It had nothing to do with title, or position. She was extraordinary and without her, the company\u2019s culture would have looked much different. I think it\u2019s one of the most over-used words in a company, and too often it\u2019s not necessarily rooted in the reality of the organization. I\u2019ve seen survey results where some employees will praise the strong family feel while others in the same company will claim just the opposite, so then, what is the real culture? In these cases, you have to look at behavior to know the real culture. If they claim to work hard, yet everyone shows up late and leaves early, that\u2019s the real culture. The CEO does typically set the example. If they don\u2019t walk the walk, don\u2019t expect anyone else to do it either. There are far too many CEOs who demand that others do things they don\u2019t do themselves. They then claim to know the culture, when it\u2019s a mere projection based on what they want to believe about their company. We\u2019ve won seven best place to work awards and yet when we go to the awards ceremonies, we hear speaker after speaker talk in the same generalities without nailing what sets them apart. Building a great company culture takes a huge effort from a lot of people who think generally along the same set of values. They then articulate those values and people either become a part of the same values or they don\u2019t, and usually leave. Yet, and this is important, you can\u2019t hoist values on a company then claim it\u2019s who you are. Those values have to come from who\u2019s already in the company and collectively you can work to shift to what matters to the group but you just can\u2019t declare it and then say it exists. It doesn\u2019t work that way. ",
