            "answer_text": "I honestly can\u2019t remember many details about 1995, but I think I built my first site with Page Mill, an Adobe product. But I might have hand coded it with Mac\u2019s textedit. My first page was a centered list of cool sites I found on the web and a heavily jpegged photo or two. It was published on space that AOL gave to its users. I\u2019m not sure but I think AOL had its own FTP to upload it. I learned HTML the way we all did back then - by looking at someone else\u2019s page, and copying it, filling in my own content, and making small changes, like the background color. There was no CSS to learn, so it was pretty easy. BGCOLOR=\u201d#000000\u201d is how you did it back in the day. And yea, we used uppercase for tags and attributes. My first professional site was for the small corporate communication firm I worked for. It was the definition of \u2018brochureware\u2019 in that I took our brochure and marked the copy up with some table tags and a swirly yellow sidebar. I uploaded it to a Network Solutions hosted server with Fetch, an FTP application I still use now and then. Netscape and the AOL browser were the browsers everyone used, although Internet Explorer changed things quickly. I still have an IE v. 2 Beta install disk (High density 1.44MB!).  I found it between a Using Netscape Navigator 2, with your Mac book and a Syquest disk. I really need to throw things out once in awhile. My first client site was the Institute for Clinical Social Work. It also was not much more than a brochure at the time. I probably used Page Mill for this too, although I switched to bbEdit fairly early. Page Mill didn\u2019t really give you the features of multi-page search and replace or table tag creation that bbEdit had. I used bbEdit for about 15 years before switching to Sublime, then Atom. Mastering web design back then meant mastering nested HTML tables and PhotoShop (or Fireworks) to create optimized gif\u2019s or jpg\u2019s for typography. Our next client was for the Home Builder\u2019s Association of Greater Chicago, and I started designing and building dozens and dozens of sites for home builders. All of them were brochures, and the only complicated feature was a contact form. JavaScript was only used for slideshows and a mortgage calculator, that I surely didn\u2019t code all by myself. I tried Go Live and Dreamweaver, and might have finished a site or two with them. But I hated the messy code they produced. I had several years of desktop publishing experience by the time I started building sites professionally, so knowledge of layout, color, fonts, etc. certainly helped me learn web design. And yea, we called it web design, not development. It was design driven, not yet dominated by what tooling, library or framework you used. There were a smattering of web design reference sites to learn from, notably Web Monkey, from Wired. And the Bare Bones Guide to HTML which is still up. As far as books, Creating Killer Web Sites, by David Siegel, 1996 was a huge influence. Full of code and design tips, it introduced the concept of third generation web sites - sites driven by design, not code. It would be another 9 years before The Zen of CSS Design book came out and really changed how I built sites. CSS Zen Garden the site, came out in 2003, about the time I went freelance, but the book really helped explain how to implement design. My copy is falling apart. In 1999 I started blogging in a subdirectory of the company I worked for, and eventually moved it to kiplog.com. It went dormant in 2010. You can get a feel for what things were like by surfing the archive list at the bottom of this hand-coded, link-rotted page \u2013 KIPLOG - archive. Eventually I switched to a content management system called Movable Type, and a few years later to WordPress, moving me from static site development into full featured site development.

W3Schools Online Web TutorialsMozilla Developer NetworkThose are just a few options you can find online. Besides that, I also purchased enough books on everything from html, css, javascript, php, mysql, linux and everything in between. I studied like crazy and within a few months, I was able to code my very first and visually UNAPPEALING website. I was far from an overnight success when it comes to webdesign, I learn by making a bunch of mistakes and figuring out how to fix them. Today, I\u2019m considered a Full Stack since I code using all the main aspects of a modern day web stack. I also use WordPress since it makes it very easy for my clients to take over once the work is done. The tools I used and use today. When I first started coding, I had my MacBook Pro and used Safari as the web browser, dreamweaver as the IDE and that\u2019s about it. I got a shared hosting account and uploaded a completely html based website with some very basic css. Now I use more tools than I can mention in just one answer, mostly because I keep on switching various tools depending on my mood. I code on a Custom Built Windows PC, I also code on my MacBook Pro and on Various Distros of Linux.I use Firefox and Chrome as my browsers of choice.I use Atom Text Editor and Visual Studio Code for everyday use and on my larger projects, I use PHPStorm.I\u2019ve come to favor using Task Runners like Gulp and Grunt to automate some of the lower level, time consuming tasks.Git is what I use for version control.That\u2019s my short list of tools that I use to code a website. Now I have my own freelance webdesign company and I\u2019m still learning new aspects of webdesign and development on a daily basis. Here\u2019s a video I created a while back that goes over my journey to becoming a freelance web designer and developer.  ",

            "answer_text": "BACKGROUND AOL was my first ISP in 1996. I dialed up with a 14.4 kbit/s modem. In 1996 I won 1st prize in an AOL Easter hunt contest. Among the amazing things I got, the most useful was a 28.8 kbit/s dial up modem, which made life so much better! 1997 I purchased a web building book with a CD in a bookstore. I used the AOL free web space to build three pages. One was for my astronomy club, our first site. The book included easy web building application that was like Word, which I was familiar with at the time. It made it easy to start to learn HTML. Then I would read the code in Notepad. It worked for me to use the code generator to make my pages and then work backwards to learn HTML as I went or as I needed to solve a page building problem. LOOKING BACK This was my learning method with previous technologies. I purchased or borrowed instructional books and code books and learned backwards. My favorite book which I still have is \u201cThe Fortran Coloring Book\u201d. (It\u2019s very funny!) The way those of us in the 1970\u2019s learned programming was to check out code books and type code into our computers to make our own games. I typed in a Star Wars game, for example, on a mini \u201cInteract\u201d computer with a cassette based memory and only 8K to work with. HTML SELF TRAINING IN 1997 I learned how to place images (which I already knew now to make or edit with Windows Paint). I liked the table code. I dreamed of making an online store based upon this structure. At the very least my pages became ways to list my favorite pages for easy access by click, a type of home directory. I then became interested in directory based web design. That shaped my future web projects. My first web host based site was Speedyhunter[dot]com. (You can see early pages at The Wayback Machine.) I envisioned it as based upon the early Yahoo directory style. Today the concept works very well with current HTML. My other web based projects that I recall include a Babylon 5 fan page, a money finding site page (pay to read, coupons, etc.) and a type of my favorite sites page. SUMMARY You learn by doing it. Today you have what did not exist when I started making web pages. Before you started, people thought of making sites that help web designers select ASCII codes, colors, clip art, scripts, code directories and tutorials. Now we have sites that help you make web page backgrounds, interesting fonts. menus and much, much more. Plus you have template sites to help you learn HTML by getting those and looking at the code.

            "answer_text": "Original Question: How did you build your first website? I built my first website in 1996 with the free copy of Adobe PageMill which the CSUN student bookstore bundled with Adobe Illustrator 6.0. (A real bargain at $99, if I recall correctly.) Since this was the mid-90s, my first website had a splash page. It featured an animated GIF which I built with a free application called GifBuilder. The website was hosted on Earthlink, which offered free space to anyone with an Earthlink user account. (10 MB of space, if I recall correctly, and I didn\u2019t come close to filling it.) I\u2019m pretty sure I used Anarchie as my FTP client. I think I still have a copy of that site around here somethwere, but it\u2019s probably on an iOmega Zip disk, which I haven\u2019t had any way of reading for at least ten years. Ah well. ",

I think I waited awhile before upgrading to a PPP account that allowed me to use Mosaic and then Netscape (web browser).
