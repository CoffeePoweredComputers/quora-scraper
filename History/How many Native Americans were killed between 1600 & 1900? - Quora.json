            "answer_text": "You will find a lot of outlandish answers to this question, including a lot of flat-out conspiracy theories that assume that the entire history of the world as contained in the scholarly works found in every world library are fictional. Here is a good starting estimate . . . The population of temperate North America, most of which became American territory between 1776 and 1853, was, in 1492, possibly as high as one to two million. After the Spanish conquest of the Caribbean and Mexico, contact with European fishermen and Spanish traders and conquistadores brought Eurasian diseases to North America and some large percentage of that population died off. It may have been as low as 50%, but there are claims, based on very dubious estimates, that it was as high as 90%. This was all before the English made any successful settlements in North America. At the time of the English settlement at Jamestown, Virginia, there were, at the most, 14,000 people living in what is now Virginia east of the Appalachians. When the Pilgrims and Puritans settled in New England, there may have been 60,000 natives in the region. We cannot be sure, as Eurasian diseases were still cutting down on their numbers. We do know that, during the colonial period, there were only a few short conflicts between the English colonists and natives, with no more than a thousand or so dead on either side over the course of a century. As an aside, virtually the entire mythos and folklore \u201cIndian raids\u201d in New England, aside from the few months of the Pequot War, involves tribal warriors and French militia from French Canada. The overall native population of temperate North America in the 17th Century may have been as high as three hundred to five hundred thousand. When people quote figures about fifty or a hundred million, they are borrowing stats from the population of the entire Western Hemisphere in the 16th Century. Only about 2% of that population lived north of Mexico. Over the course of the colonial era, between 1607 and 1776, the number of natives who died as a direct result of warfare with English/Dutch/British settlers between the Mississippi River and Atlantic coast totaled a few thousand. There were not that many wars and they involved not that many casualties. There were not enough natives along the frontier of settlement to generate more violence than that from either side. Between 1776 and 1890, the number of Native Americans who died fighting the American army and militia officially totals about 15,000. We can add to that some thirty to fifty thousand natives randomly murdered by miners, racist thugs, mobs, and vigilantes. If you combine that with the thousands who died of simple neglect and abuse in government custody\u2014such as the Trail of Tears and badly run reservations\u2014then the total can reach a hundred to a hundred fifty thousand. The Native American population in the United States dropped to under a quarter million around 1900 and has since climbed to some three million. ",

            "answer_text": "Any figure is going to be a rough estimate. The bulk of deaths were the result of imported diseases rather than deliberate killings, perhaps 70% to 90% of deaths were disease related. If the OP is looking for deaths caused by genocidal actions that figure is not available. Genocide and American Indian History - Oxford Research Encyclopedia of American History The most significant reason for Natives decline was disease \u2013 an invisible killer that wiped out an estimated 90% of the population. Unlike the Europeans and Asians, whose lifestyle had a long history of sharing close quarters with domesticated animals, Native Americans were not immune to pathogens spread by domesticated cows, pigs, sheep, goats, and horses. As a result, millions were killed by measles, influenza, whooping cough, diphtheria, typhus, bubonic plague, cholera, scarlet fever and syphilis. American Indian Genocide or American Indian Holocaust are terms used by specialists in American Indian history, as well as American Indian activists, to bring attention to what they contend is the deliberate mass destruction of American Indian populations following the European arrival in the Americas, a subject which they allege has hitherto received very limited mention in history, partially because some of the deaths happened before European chroniclers arrived to record them. Many acts which American Indian activists view as genocide are sometimes brushed aside as wartime deaths by non-Indians. Atrocities Against Native Americans - United to End Genocide Estimates of the pre-Columbian population vary widely, though uncontroversial studies place the figure for North, Central and South America at a combined 50 million to 100 million, with scholarly estimates of 2 million to 18 million for North America alone. An estimated 80% to 90% of this population perished after the arrival of Europeans, overwhelmingly from factors which deniers of genocide argue were beyond most human control \u2014 e.g., smallpox epidemics \u2014 Europeans, especially the Spanish conquistadors, also killed thousands deliberately.
