            "answer_text": "What\u2019s the rush? I appreciate that you may want to get a boyfriend at some point this year, but surely that can wait a couple of months? It\u2019s not like you would be able to introduce a new boyfriend to your family or show him off to your friends anyway, since virtually everyone is in isolation. If you are bored and lonely, by all means reach out and connect with other humans online. We are immensely fortunate that. thanks to modern technology, our isolation is only physical. You have an opportunity now to engage with people from all around the world - and Quora is a great place to start, since there are so many interesting people on here with fascinating stories and insights to share. (I\u2019m not suggesting you use Quora as a dating app, but let me know if that works for you!) This weird, unprecedented situation we find ourselves in - and I mean unprecedented on a global scale - is making a lot of people bored and lonely at one point or another. Even for ultra-introverts like me, it doesn\u2019t feel natural or healthy to be quite so completely shut off from my community. However, I would suggest that you don\u2019t try to fill this void with a romantic encounter. Firstly, now is not the time to be engaging in close contact with a whole bunch of people you don\u2019t know very well, for health reasons which I hope are too obvious to mention. Secondly, you should be wary of your impulses and desires during this stressful and uncertain time. Anxiety causes your body to release adrenaline, and adrenaline production has been shown to lead to heightened arousal and sexual attraction. This is because many of the physical sensations of arousal - increased heart rate, \u201cbutterflies\u201d, heightened senses, and shortness of breath - are pretty much identical to the physical symptoms of fear or anxiety. The problem with this is that your brain can basically be tricked into thinking you are attracted to a person purely because of the hormonal turbo boost surging through your bloodstream - a phenomenon called \u201cmisattribution of arousal\u201d. Added to this is the heightened awareness of our own mortality which tends to occur during times of social upheaval - such as wartime, or a pandemic - which makes us more inclined to seek out affection, physical intimacy, emotional support, and a feeling of connection to our fellow humans. The overall effect is that we are generally likely to assess potential partners less critically than we would under normal circumstances. In summary, this is probably not the best time to be looking for a romantic partner. If anything, it appears that many millions of people worldwide are using isolation or quarantine as an opportunity for self-reflection, evaluation of priorities, as well as \u201cbigger picture\u201d thinking and the rekindling of a sense of community. If you are self-isolating, take this opportunity to engage in self-care: slow down, eat mindfully, exercise, sleep well. You may also consider using this gift of time to undertake some self-improvement: read a great work of literature, complete an online course, learn to bake, write a story. If you focus on yourself, you can overcome any feeling of needing to have a boyfriend, and you will also have more to bring to a relationship when the opportunity to mingle and socialise returns. It won\u2019t be like this forever, I promise. Good luck! ",

They say it\u2019s awkward\u2026 but aren\u2019t first dates always awkward? Then, by the time you go on your first in-person date, you\u2019ll know each other pretty well\u2026 which will be an interesting experiment. If online dating isn\u2019t your thing (someone else recommended Tinder, but my buddy who\u2019s been Zoom dating recommends Hinge and says it\u2019s better than Tinder), you could join Facebook groups for people with similar interests to you in your area.

What you can do is download tinder, set up a profile, find a match there, and see what happens. If you find a boyfriend, you can maintain the start of your relationship online until you guys can meet for a first date. Give it a shot. No more efficient way to find a significant other during quarantine. Hope this is useful ",
