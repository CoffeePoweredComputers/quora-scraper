            "answer_text": "This is a good question in that you\u2019re not asking to \u201cbeat\u201d the ticket, you want it out and outright dropped (aka - dismissed w/o prejudice = it\u2019s over and done with, once and for all, and can't be brought back to court ). So we\u2019re not talking plea bargain or reduction in fines, or lesser charges. We\u2019re talk gone baby, gone. First off, I am only going to stick to legal, ethical means. Having your buddy who\u2019s a cop, ask the cop who wrote you to drop it can get you and everyone else in trouble. Accredited departments have policies and procedures to prevent that kind of thing happening anyway. Pleading or begging a cop to drop it, offering sexual favors, money or something else illegal or unethical is very likely to backfire, badly.  Pictured above: not the correct way to get a cop to drop a ticket. Second, there has to be something egregious about the ticket or the officer themselves, or the Department in general do not want known in court. If not, then it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll succeed. But read on and here\u2019s some thoughts: If there\u2019s misconduct on the officers part, then you can file a complaint on the officer. Depending on the situation of course, many times in order to resolve the complaint, the Department will not seek prosecution. If the officer was just stern and not friendly, don\u2019t bother.  Probably should not have arrested that 15 y/o girl for having a pool party. Another option is to go to court. If you\u2019re lucky the officer is sick that day or is otherwise out. The normal procedure for that is the court will continue all the cases to a later date. However, you can request to speak to the judge and say that continuing the case poses a credible hardship. I\u2019ve seen this happen and the person had a mother with cancer. They were taking care the mother couldn\u2019t take off anymore time. The judge asked if the person to provide evidence of that now or to the clerk of of court later and she\u2019d review it. The individual had a receipt for a nursing service that she\u2019d contracted so she could go to court that day. The judge dismissed the charge right then and there. A different take on the above is to come up with endless reasons to keep requesting continuances and delay the case till the officer quits. Most departments have a limited number of times they\u2019ll continue a case but people can get creative. We had a two continuance rule but get one of our softie judges and I\u2019ve seen three or more given regularly. My Department just dismissed the traffic tickets from people who plead not guilty after an officers leaves. So continue till the officer quits and plead not guilty! Finally, get a lawyer who specializes in traffic violations. They are a pain in the ass and will go through an officers training and recert records, the radar/laser calibration and logs, subpoena the officers notes and request a jury trial if he/she can. If the officer is slack and let any of that slide, the lawyer will identify it and bring it up as cause for dismissal. I\u2019ve seen them do it and succeed.  YMMV on a lawyer - you get what you pay for; get a cheap lawyer, you\u2019ll get a cheap defense. ",
