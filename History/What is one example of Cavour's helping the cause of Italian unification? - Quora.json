            "answer_text": "Cavour became prime minister of the Kingdom of Piedmont Sardinia in 1852, three years after the defeat in the First Italian War of Independence (1848-1849) against the Austrian Empire, which controlled much of Northern Italy. He believed piedmontese army alone was not able to free Northern Italy from Austria, so it decided to establish friendship and training relations with the two main European powers of the time France and Great Britain. To acquire international prestige Cavour sent an expeditionary force to support french and british forces in the Crimean War, and at the peace conference held in Paris in 1856 he brought the question of Italian Unification to the center of the international diplomatic debate. Cavour in 1859 formed a military alliance with the French emperor Napoleon III to convince him to support the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia. In that same year, during the Second Italian War of Independence, the French reinforcements were decisive in the liberation of Milan and Lombardy from Austria. ",
