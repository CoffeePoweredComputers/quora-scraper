            "answer_text": "Plato's theory of Forms says that abstract Forms or Ideas are what's actually real, and that the physical world and everything we take in through sensation isn't. He believed material concepts were somewhat of a copy of their corresponding idea in the non-material world. The basis of his work actually gives a possible solution for the problem of universals which asks what is the connection between general and particular concepts of the same sort. Do general concepts really exist or do they form in our brains as a simplification based on observing and taking into account many particular concepts? Plato believed general concepts exist and, are in fact, more real then the particular ones. The basic criticism of Plato is that he didn't take into account that there were certain concepts that were general, but it didn't make sense for them to be Forms, this especially applied to negatively defined concepts. Also, there are concepts that don't have a particular generalization, for example color.There are also several levels of generalization, we can say that a particular cat is a cat, but it's also an animal. Which one of these would be the Form? If the answer is the highest one, in this example, animal, then how do we know what a cat is? If the answer is both, the Form of a cat is particular of the Form of an animal, which defies the point. Also, as Plato put it, our experience and knowledge is enabled by the fact our souls have passive memories of the Forms, and because of that, we're able to recognize their manifestations in the material world which can't be classified as learning but more as a remembrance. This leaves a question, what's the point of the material world, is it even needed if the Forms exist independently and are the highest form of truth. Plato claims as well the concept of good is of the absolute nature, which is a problem because it raises the question how are we supposed to recognize good and where does that leave evil? Basically, even though his propositions were made intuitively and had a lot of issues, Plato's philosophy represented a very important milestone and it paved the way for others, especially Aristotle, who disagreed and formed his own philosophy which gave a better explanation for general and particular concepts as well as their properties (hylomorphism).

            "answer_text": "Plato and his Philosophy came under criticism from the days of his pupils to still our days and many have found the Republic an opening for objection and doubt. It is very easy to plan a Plato\u2019s Utopian state where all men in statesmanship will consider themselves as brothers , living a life of frugal means ,giving direction & running the Start/Country . In practical we cannot assume all men working above virtue that will work for the society and country in contrast to there personal life. It seldom happens in society, we can find such people, even if it is there the common property , problems will make dilution of there responsibilities. Again to rule , we need money & strength, and not wisdom alone. But in Plato\u2019s philosophy money and And military power is diluted and not with the ruling class. Such a Utopian State and Philosopher King\u2019s rule can only be in books. Plato In Republic denounces the every city into two cities ( elite class & subdued/ slavery class), but in further explanation Plato divides a city into Statesman, Soldiers and merchandisers. In a process of selection from schools on purely democratic ways , first least intelligent class is filtered out to become the merchandisers. They can do business and lead a private life. Further selection of the balance intelligent, screens out the soldiers and the cream of wise people left is trained to rule and run the country. Plato brings back the class division in new way. To Sum up, the overall Study and Criticism of Plato and his Philosophy will never cease , because its one of the basis of further evaluation and study , It happened through ages and will happen in future also ",
