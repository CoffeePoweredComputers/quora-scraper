            "answer_text": "Hello there.  According to some sources a solar Eclipse did happen on the 14th day of war when it was nearly the sunset.  As we all know the story, it was the same day Jayadrath was killed by Arjun.  Now the Kurukshetra war lasted only 18 days while in order to get a second eclipse you would need another new moon so it is not possible to have a second solar eclipse during the war as the next new moon would have happened nearly after a month (also it's extremely unlikely for 2 consecutive new moons to have solar eclipses)  Cheers !

Anybody with a good astronomy software can verify that this event if did indeed occur. Now, the eastern as well as the western astronomers have all accepted this date for the start of the Kaliyuga. A map on the last page will verify this. It does not show the North Node (Rahu), but both Rahu and Ketu (the south node) were in the same line 180 degrees apart. ",
