In 2019, we watched catastrophic fires in the Amazon. We saw extreme flooding in the Midwest. We heard the United Nations warn about unprecedented declines in biodiversity. We saw Greta Thunberg sail across the Atlantic to protest climate change alongside millions of teens and eventually become Time\u2019s person of the year. The design world responded, too, through a number of exhibitions and installations that provoked introspection about designers\u2019 role in the crisis and how they might fix their mistakes. What do you do when your industry is responsible for creating so much stuff? As the Design in Turbulent Times graduate show at Central Saint Martin\u2019s\u2014a top design school in London\u2014showed, this might mean working with biomaterials, finding alternatives to plastic, designing for longevity, or creating products from waste. With any luck, the next decade will mainstream these ideas. How The 2010s Changed Interior Design ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not quite sure what you mean by later stages. Would later mean future or past? One thing I can tell you is that interior designing has changed over the years to a very different beast than it was. We have a society that is all about consumerism & the desire for instant gratification over getting it done right. Designers are being pushed more & more to instantly gratify the needs of a diverse number of clients\u2026.which means that they are often pushed to find that certain look in products already manufactured & available. The problem here is that to have things ready made & already manufactured your choices rarely are those of quality. That means you're picking from a line of products that will eventually end up in a landfill when they go out of style\u2026so they are going to be made cheap & fast. In the past people would have their space designed & patiently wait for their products to be made & very few people had the exact item of another. The quality of the products were better\u2026heck you could take the bones of an old sofa & reupholster it five years later for a new look & it would be solid as the day you bought it. Now two year's in that sofa you thought you spent so much on that you found at RcWilley creaks when you sit on it & the padding is crushed. People want more, but want to invest less. They want it fast & are willing to sacrifice quality to have it & we designers are put through the wringer trying to satisfy these grandiose desires on limited unrealistic budgets. Thanks a lot HGTV. Now the one benefit we have of the new industry is this means that you don't have to be rich to have a beautiful home. Interior Design is no longer only for the wealthy. I actually find my mid range clients will spend more on custom products that will last, over the very wealthy & those on a tight budget. They do see it as an investment & these investments are less disposable. The other thing that has changed is that what was considered a job like being a doctor or an attorney has become so media driven. People don't look at it as a job anymore. They want to be a celebrity. That I fear has nothing to do with being a talented designer as much as it means you make nice for a camera. ",

            "answer_text": "TV. design shows have greatly changed Interior design in the last decade. Magazines have also had a huge impact. it seems that rather then trends coming up from grassroots design movements they are dictated by the pages of magazines and shows like HGTV. But there is a positive side to this. The consumer is becoming savvy and desires a beautiful home. They are also more educated about styles and have formed some of their own opinions. Personnally i love to work with a client that has a folder full of clippings from pages of magazine or something they liked on a show. It makes them part of the design process. ",

I would be generally talking in context with the Singapore market and scenario.This you can count from the fact from the number of interior design companies have emerged, number of students who are pursuing this course( has increased) and ofcourse the people who are believing more on interior designers.
