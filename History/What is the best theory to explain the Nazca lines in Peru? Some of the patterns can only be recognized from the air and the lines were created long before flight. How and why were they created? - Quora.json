            "answer_text": "The following is my speculation from what I read and what I saw on TV. Flight had little to do with it. Whatever else was going on, the Nasca lines marked off water. Water was the major concern of these people. They were very reliant on their wells and water ways. So the priests would gather information on water, and would make sure the infromation was properly distributed among the people using it. The Nazca follow underwater rivers. The lines mark off aquifers. That is probably the reason that they exhibit electrical conductivity and affect the gravitational field. The ground underneath the lines has brackish water which conducts electricity. So the electromagnetic properties weren\u2019t high technology. They were side products caused by the aquifers underneath the lines. The people that made those lines lived in a semi arrid environment. They had to use their water resources carefully. So they probably drew those lines to better manage their water. The lines could guide farmers in digging wells or agricultural ditches, for instance. There are several oases where the aquifer comes close to the surface. It is those places usually have large animal drawings, mostly animals associated with water. The patterns even if unrecognizable would help farmers recognize where the water was most easily extracted. The curvy patterns was a way of marking the oases. There could have been wells there. So even if they hadn\u2019t made them in the shape of animals, just the markings would have been useful. So the animal drawings may have been ritual objects for sympathetic magic. The drawing, even if not actually seen by people, would create a resonance that would bring down water. Water to these people equaled life. Without water, their crops and their livestock would fail. The Nasca lines may not even have been carved intentionally. It may have been people marching back and forth, looking for water. Digging for water. Probing for water. These people with their magical symbols weren\u2019t really much different from people today. Cathedrals by definition have to have a cross shaped structure. The cross shape is often modified with a fractal symmetry so as to let more sunlight into the cathedral. However, it is supposed to be a cross. The purpose this cross is magical. There is not scientific reason to make a building in the shape of the cross. Cathedrals are not intended as flight markers. The cross was chosen as a shape for cathedrals merely because it represents Christ. The purpose of the cross shape is not to guide flying machines. The cross can be easily recognized from above. However, people and next to the cathedrals would not notice it. Certainly, there were no airplanes in medieval times. One could see a cathedral from above only if it was at the base of a hill, which it seldom was. So think of the animal shapes as cathedrals for people that worshipped wet animals. The oases were where the farmer could pray for rain. ",

            "answer_text": "Nobody knows for sure. But it is most likely that Nazca lines had some religious significance. In many cultures around the world, God or Gods are supposed to live somewhere up in the heavens. So, it is logical to assume that if you wanted to attracts God\u2019s attention, you would make sure that your god can see you from above. Maybe the lines were a sort of prayer, a supplication to the gods. Maybe they were some sort of offering to the gods. Or maybe just a way of saying to the gods: \u201cHere we are. Don\u2019t forget us. Help us! Bring us rain. Give us plentiful crops.\u201d ",
