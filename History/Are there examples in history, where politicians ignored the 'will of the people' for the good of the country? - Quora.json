            "answer_text": "I can think of numerous examples - but will instead give a contrary answer- where the \u201cwill of the people\u201d led to disaster that could have been averted through leadership. Giving people what they want isn\u2019t leadership, it is populism. Convincing people that what they think they want isn\u2019t really in their (or their nation\u2019s) best interest, and instead convincing them of a different and more productive course of action, is the essence of leadership. There was an incident at sea between Rome and Tarentum. Rome sent envoys to work things out. A statesman could have informed the people of Tarentum that they would be fools to provoke Rome. But Tarentum was a democracy, not a Republic. The people were allowed to abuse the Roman envoys - including a man who voided his bowels on the toga of the lead envoy. The envoy wore the soiled toga to the Roman Senate. The Tarentines were defeated - they had to pull their walls down- and pay tribute, and swear to be a \u201cFriend to Rome\u201d. ",

In 1700 this was the key to export and import wealth. Lincoln said that slavery was so immoral that the people\u2019 will did not matter on this. Then we all know Trump takes pride in serving his extreme right wing conservatives while pissing off everyone else. I suppose this counts if you think he has a grand plan. ",
