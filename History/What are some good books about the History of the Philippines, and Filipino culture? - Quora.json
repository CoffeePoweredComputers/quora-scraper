In Our Image by Stanley Karnow Anything written by Ambeth Ocampo The Star-Entangled Banner: One Hundred Years of America in the Philippines by Sharon Elmendo Amazon.com: The Star-Entangled Banner: One Hundred Years of America in the Philippines (9780813534114) When I read a history book, I look for cold-hard facts, if the writer shows any bias, I immediately dump the book. For example: \u201cGregorio Del Pilar heroically defended Tirad Pass until his last breath.\u201d The anecdotes here are completely unnecessary and just trickle it with story-telling. Here is a better way of wording it. \u201cGeneral Del Pilar was tasked to defend Tirad Pass to halt American advance.\u201d No bias there, and informative at that. I would also recommend reading some books about the PH-American war if you want to broaden your horizons on PH-US Relations, just refer to the aforementioned authors. ",

This can be read online or dowloaded for free. Then you can go to Stanley Karnow, Sharon Elmendo, Ambeth Ocampo, Teodoro Agoncillo, and the other writers of post-Spanish Philippine history. Nick Joaquin is more anectodal than actual history. ",
