            "answer_text": "When silver was removed from coins in 1965, multiple billions of copper nickel clad nickels, dime and quarters have been made. Everyone was chasing the silver coins for the melt premium and very few people put back any of the uncirculated clad coinage. Now, 55 years later, many collectors are seeking really nice (MS 65) coins to complete date and mint sets. Most of the pre statehood quarters (1965\u20131998) in MS 65 condition sell at retail for $7 to $15 and some as high as $25 to $50, The early clad halves (1971 to 1990) bring about the same. The best years are 1982 and 1983 when the US mint didn\u2019t make any mint sets for collectors These can be found in change as people spend some of the coins that were received as a gift or disposed of when a collector passes away. Just in the last couple of months I\u2019ve gotten several really nice quarters and halves from the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s for face value. You won\u2019t have much luck with the cents, nickels and dimes but quarter and half dollar rolls yield some nice surprises. ",
