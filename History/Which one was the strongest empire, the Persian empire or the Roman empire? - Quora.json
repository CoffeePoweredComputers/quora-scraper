            "answer_text": "I am going to discuss the military aspect only as I presume that what the question is asking and where my specialities lie. First of all, there was no one Persian empire. The were in fact several. The most well-known is the Achaemenid Persian empire, ruled by Cyrus the great and his successors. After Alexander\u2019s invasion came the Parthians, these were the Romans greatest enemies, and one of the few enemies that Rome didn't conquer. Unlike the Achaemenids, the Parthians did not have an infantry based army and were thus better suited to the task of holding back the Legions. The Parthians relied on the cavalry-based force, including cataphracts (kataphrcatoi) and horse archers, which relied on manuverability and speed in order to surround and overcome the legions. Also, on open ground the Parthian cavalry were at a heavily adopted whereas the legions and the heavy armour were weighed down and were literally cooking in their plate armour (lagorica segmenta). In hilly Anatolia the Roman heavy infantry held the advantage. Thus neither force could overcome the other.     ",

            "answer_text": "There were two \u2018Roman\u2019 Empires, classical and Byzantine. Most people think of the classical, aka \u2018western\u2019 Empire. I know of at least three Persian Empires- Achaemenid (Cyrus, Xerxes et al). Parthian Empire/Sassanian Empire- the Parthians were the ones that chewed up Marcus Crassus, the Safavid Empire- direct ancestors of the last Persian Monarchy. Classical Rome lasted as a Republic and Empire some 600 years. Rome dominated Western Europe, the Mediterranean littoral, Anatolia and, for a while, Mesopotamia. The Western Empire left its language, thousands of miles of roads, dozens of aqueducts (some still usable) spanning miles, vast quantities of stone work, a concept of the rule of law, a tradition of invincibility, wide spread peace and order. The other empires were neither as extensive, nor as influential as the Western Roman Empire. Only the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium) existed longer but it never had the external impact of the Western Empire. The Achaemenid Empire was very extensive and offered some serious achievements, but survived only a shade over two centuries. Parenthetically, the most important achievement, IMHO, was the tri-lingual message (Behistun Inscription) left about the achievements of Darius- but which led western scholars to the translations of cuneiform and the languages of Summer, Babylon, Hittite, et al) All parameters considered, the Western Roman Empire was the most significant and strongest of the five candidates.
