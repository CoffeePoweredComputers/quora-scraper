            "answer_text": "\u201cAre Ancient Macedonians linked to both Greeks and Albanians?\u201d No, the ancient Macedonians are linked only to the Greeks, not to the Albanians (or to the modern Slavic people known as \u201cNorth Macedonians\u201d). Ancient Macedonians identified themselves as Greeks, whereas the Albanians were not present in antiquity, since they are first attested in history in the 11th century AD. \u201cNow that these descendants of Perdiccas [i.e: the Macedonians] are Greeks, as they themselves say, I myself chance to know and will prove it in the later part of my history.\u201d (Herodotus, \u201cHistories\u201d, 5.22.1) Furthermore, the Macedonians spoke Greek and shared the same religion, cults and customs, with the rest of the Greeks: \u201cAs members of the Greek race and speakers of the Greek language, the ancient Macedonians shared the ability to create political forms.\u201d (N.G.L. Hammond, British scholar and expert on Macedon, \u201cThe Miracle that was Macedonia\u201d, p.206) \u201cWhen we take into account the political conditions, religion and morals of the Macedonians, our conviction is strengthened that they were a Greek race and akin to the Dorians. Having stayed behind in the extreme north, they were unable to participate in the progressive civilization of the tribes which went further south.\u201d (Ulrich Wilcken, \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d, p. 22) \u201cNowadays historians generally agree that the ancient Macedonians form part of the Greek ethnos, hence they also shared in the common religions and cultural features of the Hellenic World.\u201d (\u201cThe Oxford Classical Dictionary\u201d, 3rd ed.- Macedonia, Cults, p. 905) \u201cModern scholars now almost unanimously recognise them [ancient Macedonians] as Greeks, a branch of the north-western and Dorian Greeks who after long residence in the Pindus region migrated eastward.\u201d (John V A Fine, \u201cThe Ancient Greeks; a Critical History\u201d, Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, p.605) Summing up, \u201cWe know the ancient Macedonians were fundamentally Greeks. That is to say they were Greek\ufeff speakers and ethnically they were Greeks.\u201d (Yale University, \u201cIntroduction to Ancient Greek History, Philip, Demosthenes and the Fall of the Polis\u201d, 2007) ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, as Sir Alan Pierson explained Ancient Macedonians are Greeks so much earlier than times of Classical Greece and later it is right to consider Macedonians Greeks. Albanians are not related to Macedonians but to greek people from much older times. Probably, they have the same mythical origins as Greeks as the DNA analysis says. But this is so ancient history, much older than Hellen or Illyrian distinction arose. The recent DNA analyses revealed that Albanians and Greeks generally share some common ancestry, much more common than other Balkanians and European people. So as the DNA reveals there is common ancestry between Albanians and Greeks but this is much older than ethnogenesis or even the distinction between Illyrians and Hellenes. Early farmers from across Europe directly descended from Neolithic Aegeans   ",

However, there's no essential native cultural connection, like a linguistical one, between the Ancient Macedonians and either the modern Albanians or any of the other aforementioned peoples, except for the (modern) Greeks, who\u2019re the only culturally connected to the Ancient Macedonians. It should be mentioned, though, that, from a historical perspective, the Albanians and the Romanians, unlike the Bulgarians, belong to some older cultural backgrounds to the Balkans, though far less old than that of the Greeks.

            "answer_text": "Yes, they were all linked because they all were Indo-European migrants into Europe. From there onwards there are different degrees of relation with ancient Macedonians being closer to ancient southern Greeks than modern Albanians because the linguistic evidence is showing that ancient Macedonian was either a Greek dialect or a Greek language. Therefore we are talking that the Macedonians had split from the rest of the Greek-speaking group more recently than the entire Greek-speaking group had split from the Indo-European core group. It is believed that at some point in time Illyrians, proto-Italians and Celtic language speakers formed a single linguistic and cultural group. It is not clear what relation Doric Greeks (to which group Macedonians are believed to have belonged) had to Ionian Greeks (to which Athenians are thought to have belonged). One theory is that Doric Greeks spent some time living alongside Celtic language speakers on the shores of the river Danube before migrating south into Greece. But this only is one theory. When we find where Dorian geometric pottery comes from then we will have the answer where the Dorians came from. ",
