            "answer_text": "I am just the same. Can't see clearly things that are only a few feet away so I need glasses to drive, watch tv and basically do nearly everything else. Even looking at a computer screen a few inches from my eyes is blurry without my glasses. I have two pairs and a separate pair of prescription sunglasses which I wear when I am outside during the daytime most of the time as long as it is not overcast or stormy. I squint without them as my eyes have always been sensitive to light. I don't however, need glasses to browse on my phone, look at my watch or read a book (I use a kindle paperwhite as I find this the most comfortable for my eyes). I just put my glasses on my head so they are there if I stop reading and need to move off and do something else. If I put them down somewhere, I will struggle to find them again, unless I know exactly where I put them. I have even been known to have to get my second pair to find the first. How sad is that? I would talk to your optician but generally speaking, if it is more comfortable to do something with glasses than without (and vice versa) it is better for your eyes and lifting them onto the top of your head is better than taking them off altogether. Don't try to focus through glasses if you don\u2019t need to wear them for that activity as that is just as bad for your eyes as squinting at the TV because you need you glasses to see it and haven't got them on. You will strain your eyes and eventually worsen your sight. ",

            "answer_text": "Whether to wear contact lenses in sports is a personal decision that you and your family might need to make and be in discussion with. Contact lenses have many advantages over glasses and contact sports. However, contact lenses do not protect damage to the eye from direct blow to the eye. Therefore, even with contact lenses one must be aware that I protection another sort might be needed. That is why safety glasses or helmet with visor - may be necessary. With that said, I have prescribed contact lenses on many who  participate in soccer, football, basketball, and tennis. They have all done well. Please note that what I say or write on this message is not medical, legal, financial advice.  This portion of my answer is based on your new comment. The simplistic answer of not wearing glasses at a distance of 20 cm when you're a -5.00 myopia or for any distance where myopia is worse than -2.00, is a bit unfortunate. When your eyes are looking at near without the appropriate lenses, you do not have the convergence of your muscles to help you keep things in focus. Therefore just because you can take off your eyeglasses doesn't mean that you will be comfortable seeing something that close without the use of your convergence muscles. For short periods of time, reading or looking at something without your glasses is appropriate. The remember, the secondary focal point of your eyes will judge where the best viewing distances. If you are -5.00 myopia, then the best clear distance is 20 cm which is rather close for most people's work. Please seek the services of your treating physician or eye care professional for specific advice. ",
