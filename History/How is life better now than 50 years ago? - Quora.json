            "answer_text": "I was 12. Fifty years ago. We didn't lock the door, we slept with all the windows open. The basement door was always left open. Sometimes our friends would get locked out of the house ,if they didn't make curfew . So we left the door open so they could sleep in the red room. Political parties weren't trying to start another Civil war. We had antenna TV. We only had 5 channels to watch. We had a house phone,and phone booths on almost every corner. No computers. We spent most of time outside, riding bikes. Playing in the woods. Climbing trees. Or just going for walks. Vietnam War was going on. 5 college kids were killed by the National Guard protesting the war at Michigan State University. No car phones, or cell phones. Cigarettes were 25 cents a pack, our weekly grocery shopping was 25 dollars . A phone call from a phone booth was a dime. Bottles of soda were a dime each. Movie theater tickets were 50 cents. Civil rights movement was just starting to grow stronger, feminist movement was just starting. Bobby Kennedy was asassinated, so was reverend Martin Luther King. Then all hell broke loose. After they both died. I started marching for peace, Civil rights. President Johnson was in office. He started gradually pulling our boys out of Vietnam. We had respect for adults. We ate meals together as a family. We had record players not stereos, in our rooms. FM radio stations were just becoming popular. The politics were alot more civilized. Smear campaigns hardly ever happened. There was censorship on the TV and radio stations. Nobody was allowed to use foul language on any shows or the radio. Richard Nixon became president. And a few years later was impeached. For Watergate. I could go on forever, but I'll stop here. Hope you enjoyed reminiscing with me. One more thing, the original Star Trek was on TV. Thanks for reading this. May god bless you all. ",

            "answer_text": "I was born in the United States, so my perspective is focused there. Fifty years ago: Children could play outside without minute-by-minute parental supervision. That isn't to say that kids were safe, but before both parents had to go to work just to maintain a decent standard of living, there were enough mothers at home to keep tabs on children playing. Maybe that is why horrible crimes against children happened considerably less often, or perhaps society simply hung together better then. My personal belief is that creeping income inequality has had much to do with the social unrest now threatening to upset what is left of order in my nation. The battles for racial equality, social and wage parity for women, an end to U.S. military involvement all over what was then called the Third World, and other fractures to peace and justice were raging. But fifty years ago, it looked as if a majority of the nation was beginning to choose the side of compassion and non-violence. A wave of assassinations had swept over the nation in response to the changes. Then yet another self-aggrandizing criminal set himself the task (or so the official record states) of killing Martin Luther King, Jr., the country's best-known proponent of non-violence and social justice. Somehow it all began to unravel on a hundred different domestic fronts from there. Violence is the birthright and chief perversion of many of the societies founded in the European rush to colonize the world, not just this society. You know the story. Indigenous peoples were dispossessed and decimated by contagious diseases in many parts of the globe. Slavery was the chief method of manufacturing wealth in the New World for too long a time. Up until very recent years, the government of the United States has been relatively stable, while the society was prone to internecine mayhem and murder: racially-based oppression that went beyond localized Jim Crow laws to include Jews and immigrants of Asian origin, lynchings, the rather late arrival of voting rights for women (1920, less than a hundred years ago) and some minorities, and on and, sadly, on. The penchant for using violence to \u201csolve\u201d disputes puzzles me as much as anyone. We now have a Federal government presided over by another self-aggrandizing individual who admires fascists and seems entirely ignorant of our Constitution and our history. I fear that everything that has gone wrong here will continue to grow worse. Certainly children are not safe in public places, parents often must work multiple jobs to keep the rent paid, incidents of hate crimes of various derivations have increased, and those of us who have struggled for decades on unfairly low wages go into old age fearing stunning levels of poverty and deprivation. There is no need for a border wall on our southern border. Once they learn the new realities of my country, who's going to want to come here? We still have the Constitutionally-guaranteed right to speak our minds--non-violently--and to protest. As long as we use those rights to keep the ship of state from sinking to the bottom of \u201cthe swamp\u201d, I have hope. But some of my fellow citizens are fighting tooth and claw to stay in a past that never was what they believe they remember. If a fascist government is the price of unlocked doors, personal \u201csafety\u201d, and order by law, the price is too high. ",

            "answer_text": "Better now: Personal hygiene,Personal pocket computers (smartphones) with ability to instantly recall any information (little good it has done to us though), entertain to no end, help with many areas of your life, keeping your organised, \u2026\u2026 and of course our phones can connect us anywhere, to anyone, on a whim for mere pennies.Much better cars (never ever getting lost with the SatNav; shiny outsides and plush insides; much, much cleaner \u2014 no stench at all; and safer; the dashboards feature virtually ultramodern technology with lots of information for the driver, never boring to drive), \u2014 instead of being stinky, clunky, dirty, unreliable, requiring constant maintenance and knowledge of mechanical labour, and only having a boring speedo, petrol gauge and water temperature gauge.In general we now have much more respect to environment and do much more recycling instead of multiplying the landfills. (Me, likes).Much better medicine (we really know much more about our health now, I still shudder when I recall a root canal extraction done to me with arsenicum anesthesia in 80\u2019s\u2026), and most people here in Britain do not smoke anymore, cigs are nearly banned,Computer-based weather forecasts, which are just a tad bit more accurate :)Life is generally much easier for lazy people (internet entertainment, instant books, movies, food deliveries, Amazon, lots of people at your service to do anything \u2014 but people pay for this by becoming bloated and even obese\u2026).Disabled people are no longer confined to their homes \u2014 they are now just \u201cdifferently abled\u201d.LGBT people are no longer persecuted in First World countries.You can live almost without carrying any cash around, so aren\u2019t afraid of robberies usually. You pay with small plastic cards or even the touch of your phone.The Earth is now really small due to cheap air travel. We can go anywhere on Earth for our holiday without being ultra rich. Europe is like our own backyard. We can experience things we previously usually only could read about (And get disappointed about them, too\u2026 Remember \u201cTo See Paris and Die\u201d? \u2014 well, there\u2019s nothing to die for anymore.)More ways to become rich without toiling for decades.Better then: Life with much less stressing factors and much higher overall personal security. My Mom and Dad could have one career and have jobs for life and retire comfortably at 55 and 60 correspondingly (I\u2019ll probably have to wait until I\u2019m 68 or even 70\u2026).The pace of life was very steady and not too fast at all. So lots of time for: being outdoors, gatherings and parties, chatting and drinking, pursuing hobbies.There was more luxury in certain areas for those endowed with money. Private clubs. Chauffeurs, cooks and butlers. Opulent balls and receptions. Several dressing levels.Airlines were decent places to be while flying: more leg space, more luxury, better food, more included. Cost more, too, though :)A small bit of concentrated effort could put you in front of so big a percentage of people (you knew a host of Karate moves and weren\u2019t afraid of any bullies\u2026 today you better study something advanced).Discipline in schools and at work \u2014 people knew where to be serious and where to let their hair down, as a result, services worked better.People worked locally, bought locally, lived locally a lot. Less pollution, more walking and using public transport.World was a bit safer back then. Globalisation today makes the world cantankerous and prone to explosions. More information available publicly today often just makes things worse than 50 years ago; people keep worrying about a lot of things far outside of their Sphere of Influence, things they can\u2019t change at all, \u2014 so more information is just keeping them unduly stressed and brings them no benefit.Sun was brighter, songs better, girls prettier, life easier, sex more enjoyable :) \u2014 but then this last one may or may not exactly be true \u2014 you be the judge :))",

Sure,it's abused and mistreated, but for the average person just to debate another forigener about events is astounding.Technology. I was actually hesitant to add this because there are certain aspects that I totally disdain, but overall, I think it's still been a major accomplishment.Communism, for all intent and purposes, is gone.I truly think some ways of the past are going by the wayside, especially rascists. It's hard to contemplate because just about any incident today is \u201cso in your face\u201d in part because of technology, but at the end of the day, we're trying to correct a centuries old problem in such a short period of time and have made gigantic strides. Maybe not as big as some, but compared to the 60's? Are you kidding me?The same can finally be said of the LGBT community. Just like minorities, many lost their freedom and lives to get to this point and again, while far from perfect, look at how different it was 25yrs ago.People are becoming just as excited in outer world exploration, similar to how it was 50yrs ago. We're not quite on even keel with the 1960s yet, but we're getting there, despite the lack off real possibility of going to another world anytime soon. People are starting to embrace exploring again.We're certainly aware of our surroundings. We know how we damage our world and again, we're trying to solve a century's old problem in a short time frame, but we're making strides. How many recilcle buckets were around in the 1960s?We're advancing. We can't always see it because we have both a lack of patience as well as being short-sighted at times, but we're advancing. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, when my mother was 6 years old in Houston, she was allowed to ride the trolley downtown by herself because there would be lots of adults to help her. The idea anyone would do her harm never entered anyone\u2019s mind. When I was a child, we didn\u2019t lock our doors or our cars. Every parking lot had a truck with unlocked guns on the rack, and windows down, and no one bothered them. A girl I wen to high school with posted a high school beach party picture on Facebook and commented, \u201cThere was no fear, just no fear\u201d, in the early 70\u2019s. In the 80\u2019s crime went up with immigration, but gays and minorities became generally accepted, and the top Democrats noticed they were started to lose their racism franchise. Then in the 90\u2019s they started really playing up racism in their media outlets, which became progressively difficult to maintain with all the successful blacks running around. After Barrack got elected, and reelected, the divisive media effort became intense, the average person never sees racism in their daily lives, so intense media pressure is essential for \u201cracism\u201d survive as \u201cthing\u201d. We had hate a spate of fake hate crimes because real ones are so hard to find. Invisible racism was invented with \u201cunconscious bias\u201d and \u201cmicro aggressions\u201d. There are 167 female college graduates for every 100 males, yet females claim to be oppressed. Is giving even one male an educational or employment opportunity evidence of systematic, institutional oppression? White males already have a 250% greater suicide rate than black males, and far greater than females. Do we all have to kill ourselves to satisfy their greed and need to blame their short comings on someone else? Maybe Political Correctness is just a cover for petty ego and sadistic cruelty? If we are to follow Dr. King and \u201cJudge by the content of character\u201d how should they individuals be rated? There has been celebrating in streets for months over George Floyd, but there isn\u2019t any evidence that racially motivated, not personal or just cruel. No racist comments were recorded, and the cop worked at minority club for 10 years. Hard to believe he would have kept that job if was going around being racist. Democrat\u2019s Prayer We thank thee, O Lord, for Donald John Trump, who has come to deliver Democrats in the Winter of Our Discontent. Robbed of racism, with no one to hate or demean, we suffered a terrible emptiness. We praise You for the Supporters of Trump. Legions we can demonize for the sweet rush of sanctimonious self-righteousness, in the name of love, and inclusion, and fellowship for all. Now and forever, we are delivered from personal responsibility, the need to do our part, as we cast our sins upon Donald John Trump, who suffers for our souls. Amen For me, the 60\u2019s were far safer, friendlier, more innovative, and more inclusive. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 got passed for a reason, people were ready for it. ",

            "answer_text": "Fifty years ago I was eleven. So this basically means, for me, \u201chow has the world changed in your lifetime?\u201d Most of what I observe is relatively local, not necessarily global, but it may have value none the less. People who are not of the same race or ethnic group can now be friends and family. Likewise people not heterogeneous sexually. Religion and science became enemies, but are now becoming friends again. What happens around the world is recognized as relevant to the whole world. Sometimes. Global war does not seem so imminent. Smaller scale war is everywhere and is, regretably, of lesser emotional impact to those not part of it. We have become accustomed to the same news stories with different names. I have had to live through several incarnations of the fashions of the 1970\u2032s. This seems unfair, and unlikely to change. More information (and misinformation) is available everywhere and sorting it out is difficult. Some folks have stopped trying. People left the cities for suburbs and even rural areas, and now are moving back to cities. Technology has brought us all together and also keeps us apart. (I am posting words that may be read by someone on the other side of the world, but I don't know the names of the children down the road. They probably stay indoors and play video games.) Animals still expect and need to be fed, only now I am going out to feed the peacocks as well as the dog and cats. This change is good. ",

            "answer_text": "50 years ago I was watching \"Leave it to Beaver\" on our black and white TV, playing kickball, teasing little girls, riding my bike wherever I wanted without fear, going to the skating rink, building paper airplanes and boats, and all the little things we made up to do. I watched the Ed Sullivan Show and saw some guys called The Beatles who I didn't quite understand, but they were cool. I am thinking how nice things were back in 1964 and having trouble coming up with reasons why life is better now. Kids don't have to crawl under their desks for a nuclear war drill I guess. I don't know much about grownup things in 1964, I was a kid. I am not a kid now, and mine are grown, so I don't know much about how it is for kids now as compared to then. For me, I guess it is a matter of innocence. I had it in 1964, but I had to search for it again in later years. I don't really know if that makes life today better, but I am glad I remember some of what is was like 50 years ago. I'm glad for everything I remember because that makes life today better than it would be without it. ",

            "answer_text": "I was only 8 yrs old then, so what I know is what was told to me. It was truly the best of times and the worst of times. For one thing there was no internet. That in itself would be enough to make some people want to go back into time and stay. Now maybe the info I was told was based solely on the people that they knew at the time. It may or may not be the same for those that did not live in my home state or hometown. Most people actually worked for a living, the work may not have always been glamorous in fact some work was probably very shitty work. But they knew they had to support their family, and they did the work. People were too busy trying to make a living than to concern themselves with that person that said fuck or shit while they were going to wherever they were going. People pretty much minded their own business, and let people be themselves, talk the way they were going to talk. Hey I was doing research on that era in time for something I was going to write. This much I do remember: Kids could go outside and play way after dark. But in our case dad did not like us going to the local park without an adult. He was a cop and had those he had arrested looking for a chance to get even. But in our neighborhood neighbors watched out for the kids. If someone didn\u2019t look like they belonged in the neighborhood the people would call the cops. Yeah all this leads up to: The people were different back then. That made it a lot better than here and now. Some people were very kind and good natured. Some were real assholes. Hehe. I remember one asshole that was bitching because we were walking down the street with a football, We were going to the school that was just a few short blocks away. Me being me I wised off. I had said the immortal words that have become my trademark all these years later. I was 8 years old and I said: \u201cGO FUCK YOURSELF.\u201d He yelled: \u201cWhat did you just say to me?\u201d I repeated myself. A neighbor heard it all called the police knowing my dad would probably answer the call. In the meantime the creep demanded to know my parents names. \u201cMom and Dad.\u201d He was getting madder. \u201cNO! What is their names? \u201c I stood my ground: \u201cI told you, Mom and Dad.\u201d About that time dad pulls up. I don\u2019t know what he said to the guy. The guy went back in his house, and dad told all of us kids it would be better if we just went back home. He never revealed that he was the father of two of the boys. Of course some of the neighbors knew. Never got in trouble for that one. The neighbor was not trying to get us into trouble when she called the police, she was looking out for us. ",

            "answer_text": "In the 1960s, research into automotive safety was still relatively new. Late 1960s era cars only had lap belts, meaning that front seat occupants could still bang their heads on the dashboard in a collision. Watch some videos of crash tests and compare the early ones (1960s/early 1970s) to tests on contemporary cars. Those cars were death traps compared to ones manufactured today. Cars manufactured into the 1970s typically had non-power drum brakes that would become unresponsive when they were wet. Late 1960s era cars had carbureted engines without modern emission control systems, and they ran on leaded gasoline. Cars of this vintage and the garages that they were kept in had a distinctive odor; pollution was worse, particularly in places like Los Angeles. Many cities were operating under transportation and city planning models created in the early 1950s; to some degree, this was true into my childhood in the early 1980s. Many cities had scrapped their streetcar, metro, and subway systems (did you know that Rochester, NY once had a subway?). The situation for pedestrians and cyclists was less safe than it is today. Most of the civil rights movement had taken place during the 1960s, but race relations were still very poor in Southern states at the close of the decade. I was once looking through old yearbooks at my high school in Alabama, and I was shocked to see that integration did not take place until the 1970\u20131971 school year. Also, keep in mind that both Malcolm X and Martin Luther King were assassinated for challenging the Southern status quo. Finally, some really important medical technologies, such as MRI had not yet been invented. ",
