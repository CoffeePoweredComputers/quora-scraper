            "answer_text": "Why is God so different in the Old Testament than He is in the New Testament  Bible Questions Answered Question: \"Why is God so different in the Old Testament than He is in the New Testament?\" Answer: At the very heart of this question lies a fundamental misunderstanding of what both the Old and New Testaments reveal about the nature of God. Another way of expressing this same basic thought is when people say, \u201cThe God of the Old Testament is a God of wrath while the God of the New Testament is a God of love.\u201d The fact that the Bible is God\u2019s progressive revelation of Himself to us through historical events and through His relationship with people throughout history might contribute to misconceptions about what God is like in the Old Testament as compared to the New Testament. However, when one reads both the Old and the New Testaments, it becomes evident that God is not different from one testament to another and that God\u2019s wrath and His love are revealed in both testaments. For example, throughout the Old Testament, God is declared to be a \u201ccompassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,\u201d (Exodus 34:6; Numbers 14:18; Deuteronomy 4:31; Nehemiah 9:17; Psalm 86:5, 15; 108:4; 145:8; Joel 2:13). Yet in the New Testament, God\u2019s loving-kindness and mercy are manifested even more fully through the fact that \u201cGod so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life\u201d (John 3:16). Throughout the Old Testament, we also see God dealing with Israel the same way a loving father deals with a child. When they willfully sinned against Him and began to worship idols, God would chastise them. Yet, each time He would deliver them once they had repented of their idolatry. This is much the same way God deals with Christians in the New Testament. For example, Hebrews 12:6 tells us that \u201cthe Lord disciplines the one he loves, and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son.\u201d In a similar way, throughout the Old Testament we see God\u2019s judgment and wrath poured out on sin. Likewise, in the New Testament we see that the wrath of God is still \u201cbeing revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness\u201d (Romans 1:18). So, clearly, God is no different in the Old Testament than He is in the New Testament. God by His very nature is immutable (unchanging). While we might see one aspect of His nature revealed in certain passages of Scripture more than other aspects, God Himself does not change. As we read and study the Bible, it becomes clear that God is the same in the Old and New Testaments. Even though the Bible is 66 individual books written on two (or possibly three) continents, in three different languages, over a period of approximately 1500 years by more than 40 authors, it remains one unified book from beginning to end without contradiction. In it we see how a loving, merciful, and just God deals with sinful men in all kinds of situations. Truly, the Bible is God\u2019s love letter to mankind. God\u2019s love for His creation, especially for mankind, is evident all through Scripture. Throughout the Bible we see God lovingly and mercifully calling people into a special relationship with Himself, not because they deserve it, but because He is a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth. Yet we also see a holy and righteous God who is the Judge of all those who disobey His Word and refuse to worship Him, turning instead to worship gods of their own creation (Romans chapter 1). Because of God\u2019s righteous and holy character, all sin\u2014past, present, and future\u2014must be judged. Yet God in His infinite love has provided a payment for sin and a way of reconciliation so that sinful man can escape His wrath. We see this wonderful truth in verses like 1 John 4:10: \u201cThis is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.\u201d In the Old Testament, God provided a sacrificial system whereby atonement could be made for sin. However, this sacrificial system was only temporary and merely looked forward to the coming of Jesus Christ who would die on the cross to make a complete substitutionary atonement for sin. The Savior who was promised in the Old Testament is fully revealed in the New Testament. Only envisioned in the Old Testament, the ultimate expression of God\u2019s love, the sending of His Son Jesus Christ, is revealed in all its glory in the New Testament. Both the Old and the New Testaments were given \u201cto make us wise unto salvation\u201d (2 Timothy 3:15). When we study the Testaments closely, it is evident that God \u201cdoes not change like shifting shadows\u201d (James 1:17). Recommended Resource: Knowing God by J.I.

            "answer_text": "As many have mentioned in their answers, the God of Old Testament hasn\u2019t really changed in the New Testament. I\u2019ll add my own observations here. From the beginning, one can see some consistencies throughout the Old Testament: 1. God created man in His own image and loves him the most, even above His other creations (the flora and fauna of this Earth and the other supernatural beings). 2. God wants a Father - and \u2013 Child like relationship between Himself and mankind. It\u2019s something deeper, stronger and more intimate than a simple creator-creation or master-slave sort of relationship. 3. God keeps forgiving man\u2019s transgressions. It\u2019s not clear why He allowed all the chaos to begin in the first place by putting a prohibited tree in Eden or allowing Satan or the snake there. But I guess, this is the earliest indication of freewill given to man. How would man behave when presented an option to obey or disobey God? Had it been a master-slave relationship, God would probably have put man in a completely controlled environment, secure from all possibilities of temptations. 4. God isn\u2019t binary. It looks like His rules are simple, obey Him and you\u2019ll be rewarded, disobey Him and you\u2019ll be punished. And yet, He forgave Adam and Eve. Of course, He banished them from Eden, but He continued looking after them and their children. He could have killed Cain, destroyed his soul even, for killing Abel, but He merely let him go away into the wilderness and even assured Cain that no one would kill him. He even punished people like Moses and David for their sins but blessed them too. Throughout the OT, God keeps saying that he\u2019d protect and take care of Israel (I\u2019m using this collectively refer to His chosen people) as a father. 5. God Himself said He\u2019s a jealous God. He just doesn\u2019t like His people (which is basically every person on Earth) worshipping some other god. He\u2019s wiped entire nations and cities for worshipping other gods. 6. Remember the free-will mentioned in #3. Basically God likes it when man resists all attractions to choose God. He constantly wants man to sacrifice his best. This best keeps changing, it was the best crop and animal in case of Abel and Cain, it was his only son in case of Abraham, and later, it was the best animal for the Israelites. But besides these materialistic things, God kept seeking the ultimate sacrifice of denying oneself. When there\u2019re 2 options: one terribly scary or bad and the other is obeying God, which does man choose? Adam and Eve chose disobeying God over staying stupid or less enlightened, the Israelites chose disobeying God over risking slaughter by the Pharaoh\u2019s army and later hunger and death in the vast desert, Lot\u2019s wife chose disobeying God over her love for her home and possessions. But of course, there were people who managed to deny themselves and take the bitter pill and obey God. Abraham was ready to plunge the knife into Isaac, Elijah preferred to become King Ahab\u2019s enemy but continue spreading the word of God, Joseph preferred to stay in bondage instead of falling for the Queen. 7. While God keeps saying how much He loves Israel, and it looks like this means that He hates the rest of the world, the truth is that He loved anyone who\u2019d come to Him for help and trust in Him. And so we see how He blesses Boaz, Rahab and Namaan. 8. Also, God doesn\u2019t really behave like a Santa Claus, rewarding the good people and punishing the evil ones. There\u2019re several examples where His chosen people suffered or lived very dangerous or difficult lives (like Job, the Israelites, Joseph, Elijah, Elisha, Jeremiah was put into a well!) Some like Job and Joseph were rewarded later in their lives while others died suffering. 9. Finally, throughout the OT, God keeps saying how He\u2019ll crush and defeat Satan for causing the fall of mankind, and will destroy everything sinful, including people who prefer to stay away from God. Now if we come to the New Testament, things don\u2019t really change. Probably because of all the battles in the OT, God there looks like an angry war god wreaking havoc on bad people, and Jesus looks like a relatively kind, calm vagabond in front of Him. But the bars have actually been raised in the NT. There\u2019re no more animal sacrifices required, and no, not merely because Jesus is the sacrifice. God and Jesus still want the spiritual sacrifice, they still want man to deny everything that attracts him and choose God instead. And that\u2019s why Jesus says how it\u2019s possible for a camel to pass through a needle\u2019s eye but not for a rich man to enter heaven. Or the example of the poor woman who offers the only coin she had versus a rich man who offers a very small portion of his wealth. Jesus asks for the ultimate sacrifice of denying everything, denying oneself. Love is the best thing that any person could offer to others, and Jesus wants that: the purest form of love. And if a person loves God, how can he hate another person whom God created? And hence \u201cLove your neighbour as you love yourself\u201d. And other expectations like loving those who harm you, loving your enemies, not just forgiving others but never holding a single grudge against them, never hitting others back, instead offering the other cheek too. How many people could actually do that! The forgiveness of man continues in the NT. Jesus too keeps forgiving people: the adulteress, the thief who hung on the cross with Jesus and requested Him to take him along to heaven, the Romans who later converted to Christianity, the most prominent of whom was Paul. #8 also continues well into the NT. The disciples and early Christians including Paul suffered many persecutions and even died brutal deaths. God\u2019s word being revealed to the gentiles becomes more prominent in the NT. In fact, Jesus spends more time spreading word to the gentiles than to the Jews. Probably because they had already got a chance in the OT (well their ancestors did, and the word had already been established for them), but they chose to get corrupted by power instead. And so Jesus turns to the gentiles. This again is consistent with the OT: that God loves all and forgives all but will punish whoever choses to have known Him but shun Him. And because the gentiles never knew Him in the first place, it\u2019d be unfair to punish them. So, spread the word first all across the world. Because God knows that despite this, there\u2019d be very few people who\u2019d eventually stick to Him. The NT sounds like God means serious business now. That He\u2019s wrapping up whatever He started. And that\u2019s what Jesus says, that when He\u2019d come back again, He'll come to fight. That would be the ultimate judgement day when people who\u2019ve rejected God would be punished and those who denied themselves in the truest sense or constantly sought Him would be taken to Him. That\u2019s the ultimate reward, the union between God and people who love Him. Heaven was never a place of riches or beauty or wealth and splendour. It\u2019s beautiful of course, but its embellishments aren\u2019t what make it beautiful. It\u2019s the presence of God, the place where man would eventually walk along with God like Adam and Eve did in Eden, that\u2019s its ultimate beauty. And so, God isn\u2019t different in the OT and the NT. He\u2019s been the same: loving and forgiving but jealous and vengeful at the same time. ",
