He shot and killed Alexander Hamilton in Weehawken, New Jersey, while Burr was the sitting Vice President. This event was called a \u201cduel\u201d at the time. Today we would call it a murder. Burr was never punished for it, of course. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably Spiro Agnew, VP from 1969-1973. Resigned in disgrace as a result of corruption scandals from his time as governor of Maryland. Succeeded by Gerald Ford, who became president when Richard Nixon also resigned in disgrace (for reasons entirely unrelated to Agnew's disgrace). Fun fact: if you rearrange the letters in Spiro Agnew's name you can get the phrase \u201cgrow a penis.\u201d ",

He was a party flunky and a clown and Obama\u2019s VP was the best place to put him. Now somehow they think he would be good as President, with yet again another party flunky as VP. ",
