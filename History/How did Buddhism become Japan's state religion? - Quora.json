            "answer_text": "Japan\u2019s indigenous religion is Shinto, but aware of its civilizing effect and its association with more developed cultures on the continent, Japan\u2019s aristocracy formally introduced Buddhism to Japan from the Korean kingdom of Paekche in 552. Buddhism\u2019s central role in Japanese society was subsequently entrenched by Prince Shotoku via his Seventeen Article Constitution of 604, which called for reverence for the Buddha, his teachings, and the community of monks. At that time, Shinto was unorganized and essentially animistic, but rather than confront or overcome, it was characteristic of Buddhism\u2019s philosophy of assimilation to incorporate. Consequently, by the Nara Era, the concept of honji suijaku (\u672c\u5730\u5782\u8ff9), whereby native Shint\u014d deities were viewed as reified distillations (suijaku, \u5782\u8ff9: traces) of primordial Buddhist principles (honji, \u672c\u5730: prima materia), could be considered official government policy, as evident in the slogan shinbutsu sh\u016bg\u014d (\u795e\u4ecf\u7fd2\u5408): the identity of gods and Buddhas. Some, like Yoshida Kanetomo (1435-1511), came to argue that the relationship was the reverse, that Buddhist figures were \u201ctraces\u201d of Shint\u014d kami-gods, but had little success until the Meiji Restoration of 1868 and the advent of State Shintoism. At that time, to lessen the conservative anti-foreign influence of Buddhism and guard against foreign incursion by force, as had happened in China, the new slogans became shinbutsu bunri (\u795e\u4ecf\u5206\u96e2, the separateness of gods and buddhas), haibutsu kishaku (\u5ec3\u4ecf\u6bc0\u91c8, abandon the Buddha, destroy Buddhism), and fukkoku ky\u014dgun (\u798f\u56fd\u5f37\u8ecd, enrich the nation, strengthen the army). Buddhist temples lost their land (i.e. wealth), and the political influence of Buddhism was to decrease in proportion to the rise of militaristic jingoism. ",

            "answer_text": "Japan\u2019s state religion is Buddhism as mentioned in the constitution made by Shotoku Taishi which persists even today. Most of Japan\u2019s national treasures and towering monuments are Buddhist as is most of Japanese art and museum works. NEVER trust a Western source like Wikipedia when it comes to ASIAN matters. The West has been using propaganda to dilute and distort Asian cultures for decades. The only time Buddhism was suppressed in Japan was during the dark chapter of the 2nd world war \u2014 it has made a major comeback since and most Japanese people belong to a Buddhist temple and keep Batsudan or Buddhist altars in their homes.
