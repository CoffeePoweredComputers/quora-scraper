            "answer_text": "The Difference between \u201cNation\u201d and \u201cCountry\u201d Do \u201cCountry\u201d and \u201cNation\u201d Mean the Same Thing? There is a difference between the terms nation, state, and country, even though the words are often used interchangeably. Country and State are synonymous terms that both apply to self-governing political entities. A nation, however, is a group of people who share the same culture but do not have sovereignty. When the \u201cs\u201d of state is lowercase, it constitutes a part of a whole country, such as the different states of the United States of America. When the \u201cS\u201d of State is uppercase it signifies an independent country. There are few major differences between the terms \u201ccountry\u201d and \u201cnation\u201d. In the US, these terms tend to be used synonymously due to rather strong American nationalism, which is said to have been heavily influenced by president Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 and the Promise of American Life. This kind of nationalism is more synonymous with allegiance, as whoever has ever lived and is loyal to the US could take on its nationalism. The use of the word \u201cnation\u201d that is mixed up often with \u201ccountry\u201d uses the unifying qualities of an official countrywide language and culture rather than ethnicity. Today, due to rapid Globalisation and multiple generations of immigration, many countries are starting to blend the concepts of nation and country as well. For instance, while a man\u2019s great grandparents may be Guatemalan, he may consider himself British after multiple generations of nationalisation. So What is a Nation? A nation is officially observed as a group of people who share the same cultural identity. They share the same language, culture and lineages. Kurdish people consider themselves a nation of Kurdistan, though Kurdistan is not officially recognised by either its neighbours, or Western countries. Establishing a national identity often helps people living in the same country feel united. A multitude of border and religious disputes in the Middle East, some believe, have to do with the creation of official country lines, such as the Sykes-Picot agreement, that cross originally \u2018unofficial but understood\u2019 border lines. Nationality can also be found to be used as a legal definition to describe the relationship between a person and state, such as where you are legally allowed to reside. In this case, nationality is \u201ca term of municipal law, defined by municipal law\u201d iv. Your legal nationality could be anywhere you are allowed to reside. In certain countries, if you live within a country for a specific amount of time you could become a citizen (therefore having political rights) through nationalisation. Then What is a Country? Country conversely, is synonymous with \u2018State\u2019 as it applies to self-governing political identities. The United states is a country, all abiding by the same laws of the same government. These states (not to be confused with State) are smaller communities that all adhere to one federal government in the country. Countries tend to be diverse and a conglomerate of multiple nationalities, such as American\u2019s considering themselves \u201cLatin American\u201d in order to celebrate their diversity while also creating a separate, but equally as powerful, national allegiance to the United States. A State and a country are generally used to mean the same thing. Accordingly, Republic of India or Bharat qualifies as a country and not as a nation. India has peoples of multiple races, ethnicities, cultures and languages. E.g. Gujarati people are ethnically, culturally, linguistic different than say Benglis, Tamils or other groups. Gujarati people have common things among themselves and are a nation. Therefore, India is a country of nations. How to Spot a Country from a Territory A country is also not to be confused with a territory [vi], which relies on its mother country for protection, economic support and any other features of an independent country. The US, for example, has Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam. While these territories are part of the country of the United States, Puerto Ricans would consider their nationality to be Puerto Rican. In order to be considered a country, a territory would have to regulate its own government and economy, have its own army and stand without support. Multiple Country Mergers In Europe, for example, the dissolution of certain merger states like Austria-Hungary, Yugoslavia, the USSR, or Czechoslovakia highlight the differences in nationalities combined into single countries. While the nations separately may be Austrian or Hungarian, and a man may consider himself either Austrian or Hungarian, the country at one time was combined into one. Israel and Palestine are an ideal example of strong nationalism, to the point where their nationalism is almost synonymous with their religious ideology. While much of what was originally Palestine has been dissolved into Israel, most of those who were originally Palestinian now legally living in Israel would still consider themselves Palestinian. What about a \u201cNation\u201d and a \u201cState\u201d? Separately, there also exists a \u201cnation-state\u201d, which exists when a state or country also share the same nationality. For example, while Columbia is an independent country, it is also made up of those who consider their nationality Colombian due to shared culture, religion and language. The same goes for many countries who haven\u2019t experienced much immigration in the past few generations. Japan is notoriously considered a nation-state, though it includes ethnically diverse minorities, the vast majority is homogeneous. Why Does It Matter? The importance of distinguishing between vocabulary all comes down to understanding different political landscapes. Understanding that a Palestinian living in Israel does not often consider himself an Israeli helps to understand conflict. It is understandable why major nationalist campaigns have been initiated in countries with heavy immigration, as it unifies its citizens and minimises tension and cultural differences. ",

            "answer_text": "Without getting into the nitty-gritty political science, here's a really tl;dr explanation: Nation \u2014 a group of people united by a common sociocultural or ethnographic bond, such as ethnicity, religion, language, customs, history, or \u201cnational identity\u201d, however you define that. (e.g. French in France, Quebec in Canada, Tibet in China, Hawaii in the US, Oromo in Ethiopia, Czechs in Czech Republic, Palestinians in Israel, Yoruba in Nigeria) State \u2014 a sovereign entity that exercises control over a population, such as in terms of governance, military, or economics. American \u201cstates\u201d are independent governing entities over their own territory, while the federal government can be called \u201cthe state\u201d because it exercises oversight over all 50 states. (e.g. UK govt over Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar; Chinese govt over Tibet; Indian govt over Kashmir; Russian govt over Chechnya; Iraq/Turkey govt over Kurdistan). Non-state actors can also operate like a state (e.g. ISIL or Boko Haram over their territories controlled). Country \u2014 a physical geographic region that often encompasses a nation. It might not always be a state, since it can be governed by a higher power. (e.g. Aruba controlled by the state of the Netherlands; Scotland controlled by the state of the UK; Puerto Rico governed by the US) Nation-State \u2014 a state that generally controls a sole nation (e.g Greeks controlled by Greece, Icelandics controlled by Iceland; Mongolians controlled by Mongolia). The definition of nation is subjective-- e.g. the nation of India (comprising its many ethnic groups) or the nation of the US (comprising diverse \u201cAmericans\u201d) Not every nation is a state (Tibet doesn't exercise control) or a country (Kurdistan is split between Iraq/Iran/Turkey). Not every state is a nation (North and South Korea split the Korean nation) or a country (Denmark also controls Greenland). Not every country is a nation (Israel also controls Palestine) or a state (Hong Kong is part of China). What??? How do we refer to anything then? The United Nations recognizes a list of sovereign states, that are viewed as sufficiently independent governments, and what we typically call \u201ccountries\u201d. Sovereign states may include part of, entirely, or multiple nations (North Korea, Norway, New Zealand, respectively). They may also include multiple countries or territories. The United Nations recognizes 193 independent and sovereign member states (and two observer non-member states, the Holy See/Vatican City and Palestine). There are a number of partially recognized states (or 'states with limited recognition'), recognized by only some countries. These include Kosovo (111 recognizing), Western Sahara (84 recognizing), Taiwan (14 recognizing), Abkhazia (6), South Ossetia (5), and Northern Cyprus (1). ",
