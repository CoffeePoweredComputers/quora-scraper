            "answer_text": "I am from Nigeria , and what i think of eastern African countries is that, I feel that side of Africa is more stable than the western African countries . I also think the eastern Africans are more psychologically advanced in terms of statesmanship, diplomacy and patriotism; the eastern African countries citizens are more patriotic than their west African brothers ; even the cultural values of eastern African countries gives room for patriotism to the state than western Africans , where the people believed in diaspora wealth, and running to advanced countries when the country need them. Am not saying eastern African citizens don't travel; my point is that they stay more patriotic than western Africans ,thus making corruption a little mild than in west Africa where corruption is the order of the day. Even economically ,let's forget about the bogus economy of west African countries, I.e Nigeria; the eastern African countries are more economically sound than west Africans , by the way they manage their national wealth. Kenya can be seen as a good example ; a country that has not more than Nigeria in wealth , but manages its little one more than the corrupt Nigerian economical systems. Nigeria has no national airlines; but the fleets of Kenya and Rwanda airlines are always ramming over our heads. In terms of education , eastern African countries are always thought to be \u201cthose Swahili speaking people\u201d, but I think they are more educated than west Africans , in terms of person to person education, and not institutionally based. With Seychelles activating the education for all , and actually achieving , to be the first country in Africa to achieve education for all, and Kenya and Rwanda tailing Nigeria in ICT; I think we westerners are too fond of our big tropical rain forest and big economy; but the easterners are emerging and we should watch out for countries like cape Verde, Seychelles , Kenya, Rwanda among others as the emerging force in the African hinterland .
