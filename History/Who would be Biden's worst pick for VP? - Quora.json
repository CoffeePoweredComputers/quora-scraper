            "answer_text": "I think she\u2019s out of the running now, but picking Elizabeth Warren would be a sure-fire way to ensure Trump of a second term. Personality-wise, she\u2019s Hillary Clinton 2.0, while having policy ideas that are even worse than Hillary. Come to think of it, Hillary IS eligible. That would be even worse. Poor Biden would probably mysteriously commit suicide the day after the election, if he won. There are other terrible picks he could make, even sticking to his commitment to choosing a female, but none of them are in the running or thought to be out of it now. It would be fun to see what sort of jokes Trump would make if he did choose Warren, though\u2026 ",

She\u2019s also from a family with a history of owning slaves. That and her parents were not citizens at the time of her birth which makes her an anchor baby and carries the seeds of another controversy about her eligibility. She also has a political track record of locking up black people by the 1,000s to take advantage of the super cheap labor that convicts supply (sure sounds like more slavery to me). She also has a history of engaging in assorted sexual acts purely for the sake of advancing herself which smacks of prostitution. This just gives some insight as to how bad a Joe Biden presidency would be. If he thinks this is a good choice, imagine the vast amount of harm his presidency will do the country with so much bad judgment and so many lousy people surrounding him. ",
