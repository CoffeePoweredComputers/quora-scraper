            "answer_text": "You\u2019re referring to what are known as land patents, and they go back to Colonial days. The longest and clearest history in the American Republic goes back to the Royal Colony of New York and Albany, where Lord Thomas Dongan, the Royal Governor, certified existing land grant as patents and laid down the basics of New York (colony, state, and city) boundaries and property law. This was in the 1680s, shortly after England took New York back from the Dutch. The ultimate granter of such patents is the King, but that was superceded by state authority when America became a Republic. As an example, Queen Anne gave a land grant to Trinity Church in the early 1700s, and this is still valid, and I guess Trinity to be the largest private property holder in Manhattan. ",

            "answer_text": "Originally, it was the English king through imperial land grants, then it was politicians who decided by agreements. Later, we bought a huge hunk from the French. The rest of the west was taken by force from Mexico after a war with them. All that land was then divided into states again by political agreement. ",
