            "answer_text": "Of course winning the Revolutionary War for Independence from Great Britain was a necessity to lead to the creation of the United States. But your question regards the most important battle that the United States won. That pre-supposed the USA was in existence. So I will skip the Revolutionary War. Instead, I will assert that the Bsttle of Gettysburg was super important to preserve the USA. The Confederate States had already seceded and declared their new country. If the Federal Northern Army list at Gettysburg, many scholars have written that the Northern States might have declared an armistice and negotiate a concluding peace treaty. A Gettysburg win by the South meant that Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh were next in jeopardy by the Southern Army. Perhaps General Lee would have later on pushed attacks into those major cities, if Lincoln and the Northern states weren\u2019t yet willing to quit. In any event Gettysburg resulted in a massive defeat and set the stage for the eventual Southern loss. Just think about it. If the USA split into two nations. Then how would have WW1 and WW2 been different? In other words, wouldn\u2019t this world be a totally different story if the Confederate States achieved their independence? It boggles the mind about the change in world history that could be applicable with the Confederate victory. Scholars that have studied Gettysburg have boiled the battle outcome to a few pivotal and key events in attacks and defense and tactics that played out over a few hours. The Southern Army came almost within whiskers of winning some key battles and then being in a position to win the entire battle that played out. It is really helpful and beneficial to visit the Gettysburg Battlefield and Museum. That experience really teaches the visitor just what happened and the closeness of the fighting that created the end result outcome. In summary, the Battle of Gettysburg kept America intact, created a new society of everyone being free and equal citizens, so that America could proceed forward with its territorial growth, increased industrialization, immigration policies, and evolution as a world power and player in international affairs at the dawn of the 20th century.

            "answer_text": "Since Saratoga has been included in an answer I will say Yorktown. Victory here convinced the British that the war couldn\u2019t be won. The land part of the battle was a joint effort between the Americans and the French. On the sea it was a different story with the French fleet prevailing over the British in the Battle of the Virginia Capes. Surrounded on the land and sea, Cornwallis had no choice but to surrender.
