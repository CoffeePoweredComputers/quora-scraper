            "answer_text": "The Luftwaffe [German airforce] bombed both the Buckingham Palace [where King George VI lived] and 10 Downing street. In both cases, the targets survived. Buckingham Palace alone withstood 9 bombing hits.  How the Luftwaffe bombed the palace, in the Queen Mother's own words10 Downing StreetThe King and Queen primarily lived in the Buckingham palace, and not Windsor Castle. In fact, Churchill asked the King to be safe in that castle [much more away from Germany and the castle was good enough to withstand bombs of that era], but the King refused. He wanted to be with his people and visited his subjects during the raids in their shelters. Only Princess Elizabeth and her sister Margaret were sent to the Windsor for safety. http://www.annefrankguide.net/en-US/bronnenbank.asp?aid=35657  Again, the bombing focused a lot on London as they wanted to cripple both the industrial power as well as the civilian morale. Going far west to Windsor Castle just to try hitting the monarch was not useful [even if he was there], especially when it is not going to do much damage to a castle & its residents.

            "answer_text": "The rumors of the precision of elite German bombers has been greatly exaggerated. It's not that they didn't want to, it's that precision bombing wasn't a thing.  Hell, even the US --king of precision and volume bombing-- was 90% inaccurate at best (only 35% of all aerial bombs were dropped within 1000' [305 meters] from their intended targets). Germany never invested in the kinds of bombers needed for precision bombing.  The US had the most advanced bombsight available at the time (and a closely guarded secret; equipped with a thermite self-destruct device) and despite that, most were misses by a wide margin. The Third Reich certainly achieved great results when mechanized land forces were combined with aerial attacks. But Germany had to project its air forces --alone-- over Britain who was defending her home turf. It wasn't the materiel losses that hurt Germany. It was the personnel loses. A downed RAF pilot landed in his own backyard and was back on base the next day. The Luftwaffe pilot either died or ended up in a British prison.    ",
