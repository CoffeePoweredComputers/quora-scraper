            "answer_text": "Two excellent answers by Cane and Sands. I\u2019ll only add a few points. Failing to renew the charter for the bank was the precipitating event led to \u201cThe Panic of 1837,\u201d which caused widespread economic devastation and put an end to the economic and building expansion that was occurring at the time. The proximate cause of the panic was when Jackson decreed that all new sales of US lands to individuals, etc. would have to be transacted in specie, meaning gold and/or silver. The restriction severely hampered the expansion of the United States. The second thing is that states opposed the national bank because they wanted the right to print their own currency and didn\u2019t want that to be the exclusive domain of the federal government. Numerous state banks printed currency that substituted for the national currency and was considered legal tender, although those state bills had no gold backing. At the time, even department stores printed their own \u201cscrip\u201d or \u201cchits\u201d which they gave out in change, and the \u201cwooden nickel\u201d was both a real thing, and had value. What the states wanted to do was to promote growth within their states without the obligation to actually back their currency. Regional banks and even city banks printed their own notes. Part of the reason for this was due to the hoarding of gold coins (specie) and the restriction on growth that not having that money in the system was causing. Even then, while the idea of a gold standard was supported, many knew that it came with insurmountable problems. ",

            "answer_text": "Andrew Jackson and the brand New Democratic Party opposed the Second Bank of the United States. When it was created as part of Hamilton\u2019s financial plan, it was to control the economy and money supply. Jefferson and his followers opposed the first bank because farmers, their biggest supporters, tended to suffer from greedy banks and nothing in the constitution allowed the creation of a bank by the federal government. When the first bank\u2019s charter ran out, Madison allowed the first bank to die. He soon realized his error when the economy went into a tailspin so he authorized the Second Bank. the second bank kept the economy under control but faced opposition from state governments. They wanted the right to charter their own banks and the funds the government put in them. This led to Jackson and the Democratic Party opposition. even though the Supreme Court affirmed the bsnk\u2019s legitimacy, Jackson opposed them on the constitutionality of their charter. The bank fought back but in the end Jackson won. ",
