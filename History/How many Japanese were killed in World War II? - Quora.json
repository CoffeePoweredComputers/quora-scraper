            "answer_text": "According to the Japanese Relief Bureau of the Ministry of Health and Welfare in March 1964, a total of 2,121,000 Japanese servicemen perished in WWII. The breakdown of Japanese military deaths, based on the Relief Bureau's figures, is available on the website of the Australia-Japan Research Project. Regarding civilian deaths see this answer. Complementing the above, here is some further information from John Dower\u2019s War Without Mercy (pp. 298-299): Civilian deaths in the air raids against Japan\u2019s cities which commenced in late 1944 were estimated conservatively after the war, especially in the case of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Using the official figures for conventional bombing fatalities and current revised estimates of atomic-bomb victims, the number of civilians killed in Japan proper was approximately as follows: Tokyo \t97,031 Hiroshima 140,000 Nagasaki 70,000 63 other cities 86,336 Almost all of these deaths occurred after early March 1945, when the U.S. Air Forces adopted the strategy of saturation bombing with incendiaries. The total of over 2,100,000 military and civilian Japanese deaths amounts to 3 percent of the total Japanese population at the time, but this does not convey the full picture on the Japanese side. It is estimated that only one third of the military deaths occurred in actual combat, the majority being caused by illness and starvation. Over 300,000 men were wounded severely enough to qualify for government pensions during and after the war. In 1945 alone, some 4,470,000 of the Japanese troops repatriated to Japan immediately after the surrender \u2013 the vast majority of the total fighting force \u2013 were found to be suffering from illness or injury. The condition of the imperial forces was so wretched by war\u2019s end that over 81,000 Japanese died overseas after the cease-fire before they could be repatriated by their Allied captors (other than the Soviets) \u2013 a startling figure in itself, although it went virtually unnoticed at the time and survives only as a forgotten historical footnote. The standard listings of Japanese war victims also generally neglect other deaths, both military and civilian, that occurred after as well as during the period of actual fighting. As many as 10,000 Japanese civilians may have perished on Saipan, while a recent study of the last great battle of the war, on Okinawa in the spring of 1945, places civilian deaths (including citizens recruited for war work) at 150,000 \u2013 one third of the island\u2019s population. For hundreds of thousands of Japanese, moreover, the war did not end in 1945. Scores of thousands of soldiers became absorbed by Chinese armies engaged in the civil war that wracked the mainland after Japan\u2019s defeat; thousands of others were held as Allied prisoners in Southeast Asia until as late as October 1947; and an immense number fell into the hands of the Soviet Union. The Japanese government estimated that over 1.3 million Japanese soldiers and civilians surrendered to the U.S.S.R. in Manchuria and northern Asia in August 1945, but over the course of the next four years only 1 million were repatriated to Japan \u2013 leaving more than 300,000 unaccounted for and presumed to have died after August 1945. Countless Japanese civilians, many women and children among them, failed to survive the chaos that followed the end of the war in continental Asia. In Manchuria in the winter of 1945-46 alone, it is estimated that well over 100,000 Japanese soldiers and civilians perished from hunger, cold and epidemics. When such neglected figures are added to the conventional tallies, the human cost of the war for the Japanese themselves appears to be close to 2.7 million individuals \u2013 much smaller than China\u2019s losses and less than half the combined military and civilian deaths suffered by the Germans, but twenty-five times greater than American combat deaths in the Pacific theater, and eight or nine times greater than the total number of Americans killed in World War Two. The figures for military deaths used by Dower (p. 297), based on Japanese government calculations, are the following: China War, 1937-1941: 185,647 Imperial Army, 1941-1945: 1,140,429. Thereof: Against U.S. Forces, 485,717; against British and Dutch Forces, 208,026; China, 202,958; Australian Combat Zones, 199,511; French Indochina, 2,803; Manchuria and U.S.S.R., 2,803; Other Overseas, 23,488; Japan Proper, 10,543. Imperial Navy, 1941-45: 414,879 These figures are significantly lower than those of Relief Bureau of the Ministry of Health and Welfare in March 1964 (in brackets) China 1937-1945: 388,605 (455,700) Other theaters Imperial Army, 1941-45: 937,471 (1,191,500) Imperial Navy, 1941-45: 414,879 (473,800). The most striking difference is regarding Manchuria and U.S.S.R, where the Japanese government\u2019s figure is 7,483 whereas that of the Relief Bureau is 46,700. This suggests that the latter figure also includes postwar deaths in Soviet captivity. Further figures regarding Japan\u2019s war death can be found under World War II casualties. ",

            "answer_text": " There is no easy answer. The effects of radiation are generational. At least 2 1/2 million died, which includes just under 25% of the nine million that served in the military. The rest were civilians. Other estimates exceed three million, which would be more than 4.3% of the Japanese population. It should also be noted that many of the deaths were suicides, as surrender is not a viable option for Samurai. ",
