            "answer_text": "The Story of Civilization, by a couple Will and Ariel Durant, is an eleven-volume set of books covering Western history for the general peruser. The volumes sold well for a long time, and sets of them were much of the time offered by book clubs. A complete book recording generation of every one of the eleven-volumes was delivered by Books On Tape Inc. what's more, was perused by Alexander Adams (otherwise known as Grover Gardner). The arrangement was composed over a range of over four decades. It sums four million words crosswise over almost 10,000 pages, however is inadequate. In the principal volume (Our Oriental Heritage, which covers the historical backdrop of the East through 1933), Will Durant expressed that he needed to incorporate the historical backdrop of the West through the mid twentieth century. In any case, the arrangement closes with The Age of Napoleon in light of the fact that the Durants both kicked the bucket \u2013 she in her 80s and he in his 90s \u2013 before they could finish extra volumes.

            "answer_text": "I have no idea who Will Durant is or his story of civilisation but if the history does not mention that of Native Americans before the European colonisation and after up to today then again like every where else that I see about America its as if their role in American culture and society and the price they paid for European colonisation has been airbrushed from history. This is wrong thats all I will say. ",
