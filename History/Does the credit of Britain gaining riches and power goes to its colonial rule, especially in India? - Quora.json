            "answer_text": "England did leverage India's resources, but they have also done many other things well that enabled their success. For instance, they had their American colony nearly 2 centuries before the East India Company took control of India.  India provided 3 key things: Raw materials - ranging from cotton to tea to spices.Market - India was a big consumer of London's factoriesLabor - Indians were utilized to work in the colonies from Carribean, South Africa to Fiji and Mauritius. Indian Army was almost among the biggest contingents in both the World Wars.Besides India they had the following assets: Industrial Revolution. Although the acquisition of India in the late 18th century helped grow the Industrial Revolution, Britain had plenty of good things going for it. A range of inventions (from the steam engine to railways to telegraph), Adam Smith's innovation of Capitalism,  improvements in iron manufacture and cotton gin was the real key strength of the British Empire. A range of colonies in Africa that provided everything from gold, diamonds to slaves for their colonies elsewhere. Slave trade was especially important for them there.A very lucrative spice trade in South East Asia. Eventually, its colony Malaysia provided a range of natural resources like rubber and vegetable oil.Discovery of Australia and New Zealand that was key for wool trade and gold.A flourishing fur trade in Canada and a Cotton trade with the US.A very profitable Opium trade with China.In short,  India was an important for Britain's rise, but there was also plenty more. A lot of very good practices helped England to grow - capitalism & free trade, innovations that helped manufacturing grow, emphasis on education & exploration. These helped them get a lot of colonies and set a virtuous cycle. ",

            "answer_text": "Partially, have a read of: British Empire: What did Britain gain from colonisation other than the economic benefits? for an rough idea of what else Britain gained from empire, it comes in later. As to gaining an empire, riches, and power; any entity seeking these requires an initial: technological, organizational, capital and stratagem advantage over a target territory. The credit for Britain's should probably go to it's combination of: geography, native mineral resources and culture: 1) Geography, Britain is an island, not immediately vulnerable to conquest by nomadic tribes or the standing armies of a neighbour. So since the mid 17th Cent. it had not had the expense of maintaining a large defensive standing army, freeing capital and personnel for other ventures. If you look at the GDP per capita estimates from the mid 17th Cent. you'll note Britain's GDP per capita is at least double that of any territory it later incorporates into its empire, enabling individual personnel, ships, units to be better equipped than the target population (Bigger ships, guns, more accurate navigation equipment, \u2026). See: Historical Statistics of the World Economy: 1-2008 AD - knoema.com eg. GDP per capita:  2) Native resources, for a small set of islands Britain has a multiplicity of natural resources: Gold, Silver, Tin, Iron, Copper, Lead, Zinc, Tungsten, Coal, Oil, Gas, Chalk, Flint, Salt, Timbre.... along with adjacent sources of power: wind, water, coal and vegetation (I'll ignore the sun), most of which were vital for its initial technological developments, as well as providing a secure source of capital.See: Onshore mineral resource maps, Where to find Gold in the UK, Mining in Roman Britain 3) Culture, since The Renaissance, through the Protestant Reformation, and the Age of Enlightenment limited monarchs had been founding and endowing Grammar Schools and Colleges in memorial to themselves. The most prolific was probably Edward VI (see: King Edward's School), though Henry VI colleges at Cambridge and Eton are the biggest tourist draws. These in combination with the introduction of cheap printed books, newspapers, and pamphlets, created an educated mercantile / middle class, able to access, exchange and exploit / invest in ideas (including Francis Bacon's and later Adam Smith's philosophies / stratagem), through both stock and insurance exchanges. This allowed capital to be pooled and flow to fund the development of new force multiplying ideas, wherever they came from. The Rule of law generally ensured the original investors were rewarded, through respect for private property and through the protection of a state patent or other monopoly, but this was not always the case eg. John Kay's flying shuttle. This meritocratic open system spawned what became the Industrial Revolution, which amongst many other things offered Britain a world lead in metallurgy, and therefore weaponry (power), as well eventually enabling Capitalism.  Pic: King's College, Cambridge Add to this Britain's historically meritocratic navy, with all Captains having to have served an apprenticeship of several years (and obviously survived), before gaining command of a ship, though the Royal Naval Academy later offered a root for those with little interest in years of scrubbing decks, and hauling rope. This Navy had for centuries utilised a prize / Privateer system, where crews were encouraged, and would be entitled to a share of any competing powers vessels and/or cargoes they seized, minus a cut for the Crown and the ship's owners. Which was a rather profitable system when the Spanish and Portuguese were shipping fleets of looted gold, silver and gems, from their South American conquests, in technological disadvantage ships. As well as shipping a proportion of the surviving treasure, along with holds of weapons (Firangi) on to Africa, India and China for the purchase of slaves, silk, spices and Chintz, from local merchants. So in Britain capital flowed into the construction of more and better ships and weaponry, which resulted in greater returns, to such an extent the Portuguese gave up and granted the English a monopoly on the collection and shipment of African slaves to their South American colonies, and the return trip, with slave produced materials and goods to Europe. The Empire: In the period English ships were shipping slaves for Portugal they started to establish their own colonies in North America, and on a few unwanted islands in the Caribbean, to initiate their own triangular trade of weapons and other metal item for slaves, and through plantations grow: Sugar, Tobacco, Cotton, Indigo, Coffee and Hemp. In addition fur and timbre were shipped from the Americas, and silk grown and woven at home eg. Derby Silk Mill. This broke a number of the existing trading monopolies, lowering commodity prices for Britain and reducing the capital outflow to potentially competing powers: {Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch, Danish, Othman, Persian, Mughal, Mar\u0101th\u0101, Chinese, Russian....}, weakening them and freeing capital for further colonial ventures. It's been estimated that in 1770 that 95% on the Capital Investment in the UK was funded from the Atlantic trade (See: Enslavement and Industrialisation). Similarly to quote, say The Abolition Project: British Involvement in the Transatlantic Slave Trade :- The profits gained from chattel slavery helped to finance the Industrial Revolution and the Caribbean islands became the hub of the British Empire. The sugar colonies were Britain's most valuable colonies. By the end of the eighteenth century, four million pounds came into Britain from its West Indian plantations, compared with one million from the rest of the world. The profitability of this Atlantic trade spurred the creation of a formal Mercantilism system, where nominated listed Public companies were granted monopolies on trade to a specific geographical sphere eg. Royal African Company, Virginia Company, Hudson's Bay Company, South Sea Company, East India Company... This spurred investment in, and competition between the competing entities, with each trying to supply from their bit of the globe as much of the British demand for: Chintz, Coffee, Tea, Sugar, Cotton, Silk, Tobacco, Pepper, Chili Peppers, Ginger, Rice, Lemons, Currants, Dates, Potatoes, Tomatoes, Hemp, Rubber, Cinnamon, nutmeg, maize, mace, turmeric, cardamom, cloves, saffron, indigo, opium, timber, fur.... Their importation of seed and establishment of alien crops in each region, to do this, totally destroyed the previously natural / geographic restrictions to sourcing materials, further lowering costs, and spurring efforts to process / utilise these resources even more efficiently eg. Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution This lead to Britain being able to satisfy / supply the demand for these goods globally, and at a fraction of their historic cost. A growing trade in finished products also started a slow replacement of Mercantilism with simple Capitalism, as specific geographic trading monopolies became redundant. This increase in trading also spurred capital to flow into new developments in ship construction, resulting in larger, faster, safer ships, and later steam and oil powered ships, which reduced the risk, time and cost of trade, increasing Britain's competitive advantage. As did the building of road and railways in both its own colonies, and for others, to speed the delivery of raw materials to ports, and British made produce to the merchants and customers of the interior eg. Rail transport in Argentina. Britain gained market share and wealth, while destroying local artisan based production worldwide. The destruction of artisan production weakened the likes of the Ottoman empire, to such an extent Britain and France could carve its territory up after the first World War, allowing unrestricted access to additional markets in North Africa and Arabia, for British goods. This left Britain with the largest Merchant and Navy fleets, and unrestricted access to the resources and people of a quarter of the Globe, and very few other territories willing to deny Britain access to any resource they might want to exploit, or to deny British merchants access to sell into their markets. Post empire, I'll take 1966 as the end of empire, I'm aware a few overseas territories are still connected to Britain, or gained their independence after 1966, but from a commercial perspective the vast majority had gained their independence prior to this date. If you look at Britain's GDP or GDP per capita in current prices for this year, and compare them with recent figures you'll note a 300% increase post empire. So Britain has got 3 times better off since losing its empire, but how much of this gain should be attributed to continuing relationships, or capital gained and invested under the empire is open for speculation. As to India, or the British administered part, the Princely states maintained a trading surplus, with the Raj / Britain, and only paid a token tribute (less than a penny, per head, per year), so were economically insignificant in the big picture. As Balaji Viswanathan (\u0baa\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0b9c\u0bbf \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0ba8\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0ba9\u0bcd) has already stated, the Raj provided a plentiful source of: raw materials, and the rapidly expanding population offered labour at almost slave economy rates, as well as offering a profitable and growing market for British goods, as well as raw materials from other colonies; primarily to clothe and feed the expanding population. The DIRECT trade figures nominally suggest this trade contributed between 1% and 3% of Britain's GDP, for each of the 90 years of the Raj. While letting the Raj run a balance of payments deficit with the Princely states, and the rest of the world, if not Britain (see: India as a creditor: sterling balances, 1940-1953), for this whole period drained much of the Raj of it's native capital, hindering native development / industrialisation, education and the building of capital reserves, leaving local producers unable to compete on price,a failure of indigenous production, the lack of surpluses to fund an economic restructuring, or even feed the populus in times of drought. It's also worth noting the growing of both tea and opium in commercial quantities had helped Britain weaken China economically, and eventually allowed for the establishment of Hong Kong, as a means to exploit the resources of China and the rest of the east, profiting Britain. Again as already stated the Raj's populus were used to halt the growth of the Japanese empire, as well as offering cheap manpower for European and African wars, and the building infrastructure in: Africa, Singapore, Australia, and South America, reducing costs and increasing the returns for the commissioning entities. So India contributed more than the nominal 1-3% of GDP the direct trade figures suggest, the actual amount is open to speculation. ",
