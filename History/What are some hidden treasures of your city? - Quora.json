            "answer_text": "So I have lived most of my life in Oxfordshire - England. I can guarantee that most of you have heard of it, Oxford is famed for being home to one of the most famous universities in the world and have some really beautiful architecture and museums. I thought long and hard as to what I would consider being a hidden treasure of Oxford; would it be the Pitt Rivers Museum, one of the many colleges or even the pub that J.R.R Tolkien and C.S. Lewis were known to frequent? Nope, none of these. One of my hidden treasures is this:  On first glance, you see an ordinary tree. Nothing remotely special at all. You may also notice the old building in the background. This tree sits in one of the cloisters in New College Oxford. It is a place I have spent many afternoons at, as my brother was one of the chorister (choir boys) for the College Choir. I have so many memories of afternoon parties around that tree and watching little boys play hide and seek through the arches. You\u2019re probably wondering what makes this tree so special though, aside from personal memories that I would pick it out of all the gorgeous treasures in Oxford. Well maybe to some Harry Potter fans this tree might start to be a little more familiar?    Yes, it is the very same tree that Malfoy got turned into a ferret in the 4th Harry Potter Film - Goblet of Fire. Unlike most of the other filming spots in Oxford for Harry Potter, this location is not as well known as therefore attracts a lot fewer tourists. Why I would class it as the ultimate hidden gem of my city is because it has so much cultural significance and personal significance all the while being an iconic film location. If you are even in Oxford check it out - it is normally accessible to visitors for free! - Day 6 out of 365 ",
