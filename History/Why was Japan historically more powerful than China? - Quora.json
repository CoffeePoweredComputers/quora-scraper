            "answer_text": "It wasn\u2019t. Japanese foreign policy throughout the history of Japan went through the following stages: 1: Wow, get a load of China, they\u2019re wonderful. We should be more like them. 2: China is mad. Oh crap. We\u2019re doomed. Doomed!\u2026phew. Lucky typhoon. 3: Let\u2019s just leave China alone and smile politely. 4: I think China stopped noticing us\u2026. and we\u2019ve all these excess samurai\u2026 let\u2019s invade Korea, then, you know, maybe we can take over China or something?\u2026..oh crap. China noticed us. Run away! 5: The world is scary. Netherlands, since you\u2019re not so into religion as the Catholics you can still trade a bit\u2026oh, and China of course, if you wouldn\u2019t mind so kindly please following these little rules a bit please oh China sir? 6: \u2026.We. Are. Doomed. Did you hear the news? China was beaten. Absolutely whupped. Those westerners with their super technology absolutely humiliated China. If they can do that to China then seriously we don\u2019t have a chance. Yeah it will screw over our society but we need to open a bit and hire some foreigners to modernise. 7: Modernisation is going well isn\u2019t it. But we\u2019re still not safe. Korea just refuses to modernise. They\u2019re sitting there with their fingers in their ears singing a happy little medieval song. Any minute the Chinese or Russians could march in and take over and then they\u2019d have a knife to our throat. We need to convince the Koreans to give the whole \u201cwe are more Chinese than the Chinese\u201d thing a rest and modernise!Damn China is scary. Their modernisation has gone so much better and they\u2019re so big and rich\u2026. they just sail their ships into our ports and do whatever they want and we can\u2019t do a thing\u2026. 8: Oh crap. Oh crap oh crap oh crap. We pushed too far in Korea. Now the Chinese are mad. We are utterly screwed. Doom! Doom!\u2026.wait what? We\u2019re winning?\u2026.errr\u2026\u2026\u2026.. how is that possible? How are we winning? Are you sure we are winning? Against China? Japan is beating China?\u2026..err\u2026. Yay! Go Japan! Banzai! 9: We beat China and the mighty Russian navy. We\u2019re a proper grown up modern nation now. Britain is our bestie. Lalala Japan is king of asia. This is cool. 10: OK. So the west still don\u2019t respect us and the economy has gone to hell. And just look at China. What a mess. You know, we could probably make quite a lot of money if we set up new Japan friendly governments there\u2026. 11: Why won\u2019t China surrender? We\u2019ve kicked their arses but they just won\u2019t surrender. This isn\u2019t fair. Why isn\u2019t the war over already\u2026.. Well. Nothing for it. I guess we have to attack the west. Oh. By the way. Chinese are sub human monkey-creatures. And Americans eat babies. 12: Well, that was awful. But oh well. At least we aren\u2019t communist. We really dodged a bullet with that one. Sure the Americans used us for human experimentation a bit\u2026.but the communists were a hell of a lot scarier. I\u2019m sure we will be fine. The Americans didn\u2019t rape us all afterall, which was jolly nice of them. 13: Yay business. We are super rich. Japan is going to be number 1! 14: OK. So we sort of made a mess of that one\u2026but at least we are surviving\u2026.. I guess we can make a bit of money from investing in China? 15: We are making good money from business with China but they are starting to throw their weight around a bit now\u2026 hope they don\u2019t invade our islands\u2026. better just keep smiling politely and doing business\u2026Have to hope China doesn\u2019t invade. Business as usual. Lalala. 9\u201314 are the only time Japan is more powerful than China\u2026. and that covers a span of only 100 years or so at the absolute max.For most of Japanese history foreign policy has been 95% about China; largely wanting to be like China and wanting to avoid being conquered by China with only a few tiny spells of insanity presenting deviations from this. In the first Sino-Japanese war in the 1890s everyone expected China to utterly dominate the war. Luckily for Japan China\u2019s internal problems with corruption and poor organisation meant Japan never actually had to fight the bulk of the Chinese military and they were able to win. For most of the next 50 years China was in a state of anarchy. Even the most ardent of Japanese nationalists would be lying if he claimed that he thought Japan had been more powerful than China for most of history. ",

            "answer_text": "\"It's not just about good infrastructure. It's about the personnel taking pride in their work and having the right training to meet these high expectations.\" In a global survey of more than 21,000 people, Japan ranked as the No. 5 Best Country in 2017, two spots better than its rank in 2016 and 10 spots better than Singapore, the closest ranking regional neighbor. \"Japan has become the Queen Elizabeth of countries, inoffensive yet respected,\" says Russell Green, co-author of \"What Happened to 'Japan as Number One'?\" and Will Clayton Fellow in International Economics at Rice University. \"A slow-growth economy and aging population mean Japan does not threaten anyone, yet it remains a rich, technologically advanced country with a vibrant culture.\" During times of political and economic upheaval across the world, Japan \u2013 with its efficient public transportation, carefully choreographed tea ceremonies and hierarchical organization \u2013 seems to present order and consistency as attractive alternatives. But some experts argue that a country that has built up such substantial international influence over its long history could do more to lead the world forward. \"Stability is a good thing, but it depends on your perspective,\" says Sheila Smith, a senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"It is good if the rest of the world is volatile, but not good if you want change or reform.\" Japan is a champion of cosmopolitanism, a mindset that experts agree has brought a high quality of life and great amount of equity to its citizens and one that can serve as a model for other nations struggling with growing stratification. \"There are several trends that Japan has been able to maintain: commitment to social equality, commitment to democracy and commitment to a positive role in international affairs,\" says Christina Davis, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University. \"It's remarkable that a decline in economic prosperity and a change in its region with the rise of China's power have not set back those basic set of commitments.\" Two decades of stagnated growth after its bubble burst in 1990 set Japan well behind economic predictions. In 2010, China overtook Japan as the world's second-largest economy, and while Japan maintained the third-largest economy, it was effectively pushed out of superpower status. Despite the economic challenges, Japan continued to funnel resources into key pillars of its model: investment in research and development rose from 2.8 percent of gross domestic product in 1996 to 3.5 percent in 2008, and government expenditure in education remained steady at 3.5 percent of gross domestic product, just slightly below the global average, according to the World Bank. But with a rapidly shrinking workforce due to an aging population and one of the lowest rates of incoming foreign direct investment among developed economies, experts say it is critical for Japan to pivot away from its traditionally nationalistic policies. China was able to grow only in the last century, but japan was the all time head. ",
