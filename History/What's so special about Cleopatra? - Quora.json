            "answer_text": "Another great answer from User-10661484422791150723... The bit I'd add would be to suggest that she sits at the  intersection of of three very different but very influential ways of talking about history in a way that few historical personalities manage. Ethan's answer has the political side: She was a key player in the dizzying power struggles which spanned the end of the Republic and which, for a variety of reasons, we know a great deal about (it's hard to over-estimate how much we have lost in terms of original source material about even this well documented time, and many other equally interesting and important periods exists for us only through a single source or fragments of lost authors) .  So one reason Cleopatra is special is because she was an important figure in an important period which is well documented.   Historiographically, she's one of the most well documented women of antiquity as well.  This was not a period in which women played big roles on the public stage, so she gets a lot of attention from scholars who want to investigate this poorly documented aspect of antiquity,  and from writers looking for feminist role models. Finally -- but I think most importantly -- the first two answers combine with the non-academic, non-political tradition of writing history as drama.  This tradition goes all the way back to ancient authors like Plutarch or Herodotus who saw history primarily through the lens of human interactions and personalities.  Unlike modern history, which looks at big impersonal forces like economics, politics, and social change the \"dramatic school\" of history focuses on memorable personalities and dramatic situations.   Cleopatra's story is pure gold for the dramatic historian: it includes notable personalities like Caesar, the calculating but overly trusting genius; headstrong, passionate Antony; Octavian, the ruthless but farsighted dictator.   Most important of all is  Cleopatra herself,  who managed to form close liaisons with with two of the most powerful men of a turbulent age.   Her story is full of memorable incidents  -- the apocryphal story of having herself rolled into a carpet to sneak into a private audience with Caesar:   The fact that she bore Caesar's only son, and made a spectacular entry into Rome:    The famously luxurious effort to woo Athony in Tarsus:  The barge she sat in, like a burnish\u2019d throne, Burned on the water: the poop was beaten gold; Purple the sails, and so perfumed that The winds were lovesick with them; the oars were silver, Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made The water which they beat to follow faster, As amorous of their strokes. For her own person, It beggar\u2019d all description: she did lie In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold of tissue, O\u2019erpicturing that Venus where we see The fancy outwork nature: on each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids, With divers-colour\u2019d fans, whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool, And what they undid did.  - Shakespeare, Antony and Cleopatra And of course her (reputed) dramatic suicide by snake: And it's all wrapped up in exotic costumes and settings (never mind that she lived a a millennium and a half after the age of the pyramids, the exotic decor and lavish trimmings  a priceless to a would-be artists, poet, or filmmaker). These are the makings first-class potboiler.  Not surprisingly this story is a perennial favorite of authors down the ages from ancient times to George Bernard Shaw, Bocaccio, Corneille, and Shakespeare.  With that kind of copyright-free background, movies like the 1963 film with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton or the 1934 version with Claudette Colbert are inevitable. ",

            "answer_text": "Cleopatra spoke several languages, including Greek (the language of all educated Romans) and even Egyptian. Although she belonged to the Ptolemaic dynasty (the 31st and last dynasty to rule Egypt), her family lineage was Hellenistic. She was the descendant of one of Alexander the Great's inner circle of generals, a man known as Ptolemy. We may think of the name as Egyptian, but it was actually Greek. None of the pharaohs of her family had ever cared to learn Egyptian. In that regard they resembled the early Norman rulers of England, who only spoke French, or the Hanoverian kings of England, who only spoke German.She was married to her own brother, Ptolemy XIV - as was the Egyptian custom for the Pharaonic line. She proved to be cleverer than he, and also lucky. He died in 44 BC, sometime after Caesar's assassination, upon which she assumed sole and total control of Egypt. It was then one of the richest countries in the Mediterranean World. Egypt's fertility and harvests brought in this wealth, which in a world that could not conserve food, as we do today, made Egypt a power unto itself - even without regard to its military might.Cleopatra came up against the most impressive leaders of a rapidly expanding Rome. She charmed Julius Caesar first. Marriage to a non-Roman was not possible in his lifetime. Having a son by him was an act of dynastic maneuvering Caesar had three wives over time, and other liaisons as well. The emperor Augustus had himself discarded two wives before arriving at Livia. Succession was not necessarily through physical sonship. Julius Caesar adopted Octavian; Octavian adopted Tiberius, and on and on for generations. Vespasian was the first to be able to pass his title on to his sons Titus and then to his brother Domitian. This way of ascending to the Roman imperium was rare on the whole.Cleopatra was in Rome when Caesar was assassinated, and had to make her way safely back to Egypt. When Mark Anthony came to power in the Triumvirate, she had to win him over as well. She may not have looked like Elizabeth Taylor, but she knew how to charm and captivate a powerful man, and run a kingdom at the same time. Had the Battle of Actium gone the other way, she and Mark Anthony might have ended up ruling the Mediterranean, rather than Octavian - Augustus.It is the unseen side of her talents that must not be discounted. The stories about her often trade on a storyteller's interests. She was a highly educated and intelligent woman who was able to maintain her place in the world for two decades, an incredible feat by any standards. At her death Augustus took the whole of Egypt for himself, and never permitted any senator to even set foot in the country on pain of death. The whole of the Egyptian economy was funneled directly into the imperial treasury - and fueled emperors and their ambitions for centuries.Cleopatra achieved and maintained the great empire of Egypt for over 20 years, with almost 16 of these years as its sole ruler. While public performance was (and still is) part of the ruler's roles, it made up only the outermost part of running an empire that was under threat the whole time of her reign. To reduce her to a mere charmer of powerful men is to miss the majesty of one of history's most impressive rulers. ",

The greatest accomplishment of Cleopatra the revival of early dynastic beliefs and traditions , social structure and practices we see as being synonymous with Ancient Egypt by reestablishing it as an independent nation ( kind of super power) in its own right.The expansion of Egypt and its economy which made it so attractive to conquerors.Expansion of knowledge and gathering of knowledge particularly from earlier civilizations across the known world at the time and expanding the Bibliotheca Alexandrina (library in Alexandria).Development of sound social structures including health care and educationShe sacrificed her personal life to make sure that the nation\u2019s interests are well suited. She is considered to be a really good seductress. She used her charm to seduce two of the most powerful Roman emperors, Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, gained control over Egypt. One of her greatest accomplishments was a marked improvement in the role of women in the society in those times. Also, her personal life inspired many to treat marriage as nothing more than a partnership, with each of the two partners having his/her individual responsibilities to fulfill. Her accomplishment as a successful woman leader led her to become a role model for all women living in her time. Her inner beauty, intelligence, education, and passionate devotion to the well being of Egypt offer significant hints of some of the most important developments in her life and death. When Egypt was conquered. Famously, she killed herself rather than be humiliatingly paraded through Rome. This pinpoints how strong she was. ",
