            "answer_text": "If you have a title of Duke and no higher, you\u2019re free to hold as many duchies as you want. If you give any away their new holders will be independent so it\u2019s usually desirable to just hold the titles yourself. If you\u2019re a King or an Emperor you should never have more than two ducal titles. The reason is simple, you incur a -10 opinion penalty for each duchy over tw, so you should either destroy or give away any titles in excess of two.  Said opinion penalty, 21 held duchies. The question now becomes do you consent with counts only or do you really want dukes. If you have vassal limit turned that\u2019s a no-brainer, you\u2019ll need dukes so you can have a decently sized realm. Without the vassal limit having a realm with no lord being higher than a count is a viable strategy. However I argue against it. It\u2019s easier to keep the tabs on 10 dukes than on 30 counts. If the dukes turn against you, you befriend one, intermarry with another, bribe two and band together to beat up the other six and replace them with someone more trustworthy. If you have imperial administration (or are Islamic) you\u2019re (sometimes) allowed to revoke ducal titles and give them to someone more loyal. Furthermore you can and should create vassal republics and archbishopics, the former for trade income and ship levy, the other for morey, culture research points and loyalty. It\u2019s easier to keep the church loyal than feudal rulers, especially if you\u2019re Christian with their monastic orders and celibate clergy. The main value of dutchies is therefore greater stability of your realm overall. Yes, dukes will fight one another, what of it? The important thing is they don\u2019t fight against you. ",
