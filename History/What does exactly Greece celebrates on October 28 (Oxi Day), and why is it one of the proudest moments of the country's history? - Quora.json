Now most European nations tend to celebrate VE day (May 8) marking the end of the war, or perhaps a day of liberation (Paris still honors August 25 1944 when the Nazis were finally and forever thrown out of the city) but Greece remembers the day they entered into the war--despite the occupation and the horrors it would bring. Why is that? For Greece liberation officially of (most) of the nation was October 1944, the 12th I believe so both dates are rather close. But for Greece the horrors didn't end there as the nation fell into civil war, the first \u201chot\" battleground of the not always \u201cCold War.\u201d But October 28 1940 was the day Greece refused to surrender to her aggressive neighbor, refused to bow down, and standing alone but united (for a time) launched the first major defeat of an Axis Power in the war, and evan began to liberate another nation. It was also a signal to the world that the Axis Nations could and would someday been defeated. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a proud moment, one of the proudest in modern history because it is iconic of Greek defiance. The Greek dictator Ioannis Metaxas took over power in August 1936. He molded his regime after Mussolini\u2019s Italy. With fascist salutes, parades, populist decisions, the works  Photo Source (Metaxas in the center with the glasses) The regime was never hardcore racist (for example it allowed Jews to be part of it) but that didn\u2019t prevent it from burning books not just of Marx and Engels but even of Darwin, Froyd and B. Shaw[1] . Politically Metaxas tried to balance his ideology with the overwhelming British power in the Mediterranean and of course the pro-British stance of the King. Mussolini on the other hand, was Il Duce. He wouldn\u2019t care less if Metaxas was pro-fascist in exactly the same way he didn\u2019t care about the ideology of Haile Selassie - Wikipedia . So he started provoking neutral Greece even by torpedoing and sinking a Greek cruiser participating in festivities on Virgin Mary\u2019s celebrations of Aug.15 (1940) in the island of Tinos.  Photo Source (and story of the incident) Metaxas still thinking he could avoid the war did not reveal the identity of the perpetrators. Mussolini would have nothing to do with that so at 3 a.m. in the morning of October 28 the Italian ambassador Emanuele Grazzi delivered an ultimatum. Greece was supposed to let Axis forces enter the country and also occupy (unnamed) strategic sites or it will be war. To which Metaxas replied \u201cAlors, c\u2019est la guerre.\u201d (Then, it is war) which popular myth later turned into a laconic \u201cOXI\u201d (NO)[2] The decision regardless of the person who said it and his ideology or previous actions is a testament of the fierce defiance and patriotism of Greece. And it wouldn\u2019t have made such a good story if the rowdy Greeks fueled only by patriotism and taking advantage of the rugged mountainous terrain didn\u2019t just successfully repel the Italian attack but actually had them on the run conquering territories belonging to the Italian protectorate of Albania[3].
