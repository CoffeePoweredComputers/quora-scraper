He\u2019s also proven that the United States system of checks and balances doesn\u2019t work when political parties put party over country. He\u2019s allowed racists, bullies, sexists, misogynists, white nationalists and the KKK to come out of the closet. And, he\u2019s made it abundantly clear that ANYONE can become President of the United States. There are absolutely zero qualifications for the job. ",
