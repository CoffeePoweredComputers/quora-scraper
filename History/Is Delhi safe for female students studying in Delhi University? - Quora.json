            "answer_text": "I can totally understand the parents concern for sending their daughters to Delhi for studying especially the out station students.. Trust me I am one among them. But it's totally safe at DU. Every college of Delhi University has an women empowerment cell and it is very active. There is a havoc created in the media about Delhi incidents as it is the centre of attraction. As Delhi being a metropolitan city and the capital of our country. But every city of India faces the same scenario.. No such city exists that can be stated as the safest place for women.. Atlast its the girls who have to act smart as such people exist everywhere and this shouldn't stop you from achieving your dreams.. Trust me you will have a great experience here in DU. ",

            "answer_text": "I can totally understand if you're a parent or an outstation student who trust news channels to give them true information. I can assure you that there is nothing to worry about . Almost every college in Delhi University has a special cell known as Women Empowerment Cell. These Cells ensure the safety of every female student. Furthermore, I feel that taking the opportunity from your child to explore and to learn new things, just because you're doubtful that there would be a certain kind of danger looming on her isn't a right thing. Bad people are everywhere but that shouldn't stop one to achieve their dreams. Delhi isn't the safest city but so are the other Metropolitan cities. The Hype has worsened the situation. Trust me DU is Safe. ",
