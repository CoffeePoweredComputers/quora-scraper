            "answer_text": "Scientific revolution is the era of shifting focus from God to power of reasoning. Its most radical impact was separating science from religion. It roughly happened in 1500\u20131700 in Europe. Scientific Revolution was a phase during which the flawed concepts established by the Church regarding physical events were replaced by theories that could be verified through experiments.The Europe of middle ages was under the influence of feudal lords and Catholic Church where reason and logic were completely discouraged. Teachings were made in Latin Language unknown to common people. To make people aware of the truth and bring scientific and logical thinking into their lives, many personalities contributed hugely towards Scientific Revolution including:- Nicolas Copernicus theory of heliocentric (1543) is considered beginning of scientific reasons in which he suggested that sun was at center of universe & earth and other planets revolved around sun in circular orbit. He disbanded Aristotle view of motionless earth as center of universe. Bruno who supported Copernicus view was burnt alive Galileo invented Telescope in 1554 and expanded knowledge about space, He proved that Copernicus was right. Isaac Newton Propounded the three laws of motion, found gravity and helped prove the points of Copernicus and Galileo. Kepler supported Copernicus theory and emphasized planets move around sun in an elliptical orbit.Ideas formed during the Scientific Revolution continue to influence the world today. It changed the way of the world and people's perspective of it. It played a great role in discovery of new lands, scientific advancements, Industrial revolution and Enlightenment. Edit 1: A small correction, Galileo did not invent the telescope, It was invented in Holland, but he was the first to point a telescope to the sky and use it as a scientific instrument. He is should be praised for his accomplishes here and in other areas of science. His use of mathematics to quantify his observations and develop mathematical explanations have lead many scholars to say Galileo was the first modern scientist. Thankyou @Alan for pointing it out in comments. ",

            "answer_text": "Mr. Salve answer to this question is good. I would like to add that if you consider significant changes in our ideas and theories of Nature as revolutionary events (like the change from Newtonian mechanics to special relativity or to quantum mechanics) then the scientific revolution continues to this day. The recognition of the constant \u2018evolution\u2019 of scientific thought in its early years has been embraced today as a major strength of science. Scientific ideas and formal theories are not viewed as authoritative, like religious articles of faith, but as \u2018Very Good Approximations\u2019 of how Nature works. As very good approximations these theories can be very useful for practical applications. However, as approximations they are subject to extension, refinement, and replacement if new data from Nature warrants it. However, I do agree with Mr. Salve that the biggest break from ancient/medieval ways of thinking to scientific thinking occurred between roughly between 1500 and 1800. AD (or CE) (1700 is a bit too early in my opinion.) ",
