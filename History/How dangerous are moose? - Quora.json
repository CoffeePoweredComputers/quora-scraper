            "answer_text": " As others have said: yes, moose are very dangerous animals despite their apparent harmlessness and herbivorous diet. In fact, zoologists claim that people in the USA are more likely to get attacked by a moose rather than by a bear! Here\u2019s why:  On one hand, being the world\u2019s largest deer, adult males can weigh up to 700 kg (far more than a 270 kg grizzly bear), and can become aggressive if threatened, since they\u2019re equipped with a bad temper, deadly hooves and antlers, which can disembowel any threat that gets in their way, including humans and domestic dogs.  On the other hand, the females are no less feisty, despite lacking antlers and having a smaller size, because they can viciously attack any threat to their young, and do vigorously use their lethal hooves and strong legs that regularly inflict the most severe damage possible.  In light of the ever-increasing human encroachment on natural grounds, as well as the absence of large predators that can control moose numbers in most US states, moose numbers are on the rise (around 300,000 individuals), and so they are conquering our own backyards, where they forage for food, establish territories within urban cities, and occasionally attack humans and family pets.  Most attacks occur not only when moose retaliate because of provocation, but also when they solicit food from people \u2013 indeed, most people hand-feed any moose they find, disregarding that this behavior (however well-intentioned) is actually wrong, because it encourages the animals to lose their habitual fear of Man, to constantly return to the places (such as a human habitation) where they were once given food, and to become aggressive should they not receive it; as a result, the state of Alaska has considered feeding a moose as a crime punishable by fine of 110 dollars.  Based on all of this, it\u2019s crystal clear that moose are dangerous and do attack people for the previously mentioned reasons. Consequently, moose attacks on humans have reached the numbers of around 5\u201310 annually, which is considered higher than the attacks inflicted by bears. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes moose can be very dangerous! They are spread out across the upper part of north America, mainly staying in areas with plenty of wetlands and cooler temperatures. Depending on location between September and October is the mating season or \u201crut\" bull moose can be extremely agressive when defending the cow they are pursuing. In Washington state there is a game reserve that has an open safari style area where the herbivores are free to roam, there is a tram that you can ride through this area. Some of the other animals in this area are elk, deer, bighorn sheep, and of course moose. I'm guessing this was about 20 years ago as my son was really young, we were on the tram and I was videotaping the various animals while the driver was narrating the tour, she began to talk about the moose and that they were in rut and she warned us that if the moose spotted us and decided to charge she would need to accelerate to avoid any issues with the moose. She explained that there were several incidents in the weeks prior where the bull moose had attacked trams driving through his territory, sure enough as soon as she said that the bull came charging at us from the brush to our left. I still have the VHS tape somewhere. The parks best guess was that the mirrors on the tram which were pretty big(think public bus mirrors) and it was perceived by to bull to be another bull trying to steal his cow. Cows can also be very aggressive in spring when they are protecting their offspring. Funny side note a few years after this event there was one of those funniest home movies clip shows on and I heard this familiar voice and looked up and was almost positive that the clip was sent in by someone on the exact same tram I was on, upon digging out the tape from that day my memory was correct someone who was on the same tram as me, also videoing the tour sent them a copy of the tape they had. It was the same woman driving and the audio recording matched mine exactly. ",
