            "answer_text": "As far as I\u2019m concerned the events in Jamestown were educational in regards to economic and political systems for many reasons. For one, the example of how people put in an extreme environment can not survive unless all of them work together to do it was put center stage. As the colony grew from the small number of pioneers to a larger community, the need for more food and other basic items of survival grew with it as did the lack of ability and desire to work of some of the colonists. Thus the basic premise of communism or socialism was put to the test and failed due to the fundamental problem of human nature. Some folks are workers and doers that contribute to the welfare of all and others are not and draw down the store. From these and other global events, we grew to understand what Adam Smith explained in his writings The Wealth of Nations - Wikipedia These theories from Smith are the foundation of capitalism and if the capitalist system is developed and operated by honest, community-minded folks it far surpasses the results of any other system. In today's world, (primarily in America) the capitalist system has been bastardized by the greed and dishonesty of business people and politicians alike by creating a socialistic system of freebies & handouts that keep politicians in office and allow corporations to buy them using lobbyists. This furthers the destruction of the free market that Smith envisioned and eventually will bring down the capitalist system. However, the idea of pulling it down in favor of a more socialistic or communistic system is not the answer. The events of Jamestown and the eventual demise of the group is proof that these alternatives will eventually fail. It\u2019s always about human nature and a basic work ethic matched with honesty and integrity. Americans today MUST involve themselves in their local & national politics and their communities by embracing the ideas of Adam Smith and demanding honesty & integrity from their corporations and their governments. By ignoring the corruption and greed that plays itself out daily across the country we are setting the stage for the failure of the first true capitalist republic that created wealth and security across the globe for more than two centuries.
