            "answer_text": "About as good as any other fast-firing rifle-calibre machine gun on a Louch Pole or similar mount - it was fairly ineffective at destroying enemy aircraft, but provided at least some All Arms Air Defence, got tracer in the sky to at least spoil the attacking pilot\u2019s aim, and let the gunner feel they were achieving something more than being a helpless target. For ground use relatively few aircraft came close enough to be threatened by it (initially Luftwaffe tactics, later Allied air superiority); as a defensive gun it was a typical hand-held rifle-calibre gun, fast-firing and reliable but otherwise unexceptional. Replaced in the AA role by 20mm Oerlikons and 40mm Bofors, and in the aircraft role by belt-fed Colt-Brownings in power-operated turrets, the Vickers \u2018K\u2019 served on by arming merchant ships and Coastal Forces craft, and was most noticeably used by the Long Range Desert Group to arm their raiding jeeps.
