            "answer_text": "De Souza surname originates from the Sousa River (Portuguese: rio Sousa) which is a river in Portugal, as well as three parishes along it namely Foz do Sousa, Aguiar de Sousa, and Pa\u00e7o de Sousa. The word Sousa, Sausa, or Susa originates from the latin word Saxa which means 'rocks'. See Sousa river:  Source: Sousa River - Wikipedia During the initial period of colonization, the Portuguese soldiers and settlers were encouraged to marry local women, wherein their children were given their fathers' last names which includes common surnames such as de Souza, de Silva, Costa, Heredia, Fernandes & Santos. See Stamp depicting Malacca-born Manuel Godinho de Er\u00e9dia, or Emanuel Godinho de Her\u00e9dia, a mixed Malay-Portuguese writer and cartographer.  In mid 16th century the Portuguese King decreed that young orphaned Portuguese women be sent to the colonies to marry their soldiers & settlers in order to curtail inter-racial marriages. These Orf\u00e3s do Rei (\"Orphans of the King\") ( \u00d3rf\u00e3s d'El-Rei - Wikipedia ) also married native rulers who were either in exile or allied to the Portuguese.
