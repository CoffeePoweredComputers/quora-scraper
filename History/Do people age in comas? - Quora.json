            "answer_text": "They do indeed.  Some people have argued that such people age at a slower rate, but this is really only half the story.  It would be true that if you were (purely as an example, of course) in a coma, then because it would follow that you were bed-bound and therefore not exposed to external pollutants, sunlight and so forth, then your skin should (theoretically) age at a slower rate.  However, part of an all-rounded well-being plan, we take exercise and a balanced diet.  A person in a coma cannot take a balanced diet due to their condition (I know there is quite the movement towards taking a whole bunch of pills and supplements to maintain good health, but the practicality is that it does not work).  A person in a coma can (obviously) not take any exercise.  A person in a coma must be maintained on a lot of IV fluids and supplements, all of which will, over the years, add some insult to the liver and other major organs.  I am sure you would agree that muscular atrophy is a major concern, but just as you would expect this for the obvious muscle groups, it is also true of the cardiac muscle, which would receive no stress nor positive exercise and eventually grow weaker.  The combination of everything mentioned above (and probably a lot more I have forgotten since), said person will age like everybody else, but for different reasons to why we would age in the waking world. What does happen to comatose patients who awaken after a very long time is that their mind tends not to age.  So, if you were (for example) 10 years old and fell into a coma and then 15 years later came out of it, while your body would be that of a 25 year old (only with much more decrepitude due to lack of exercise and solid food), your mind would still be in exactly the same place as when you first fell into the coma.  Remember, you would have not received any education since then, would not have read a single book nor seen a documentary, nor had a conversation, nor experienced any kind of life other than your own dreams (which would be what you would expect from a 10 year old mind).  Such a person can be turned around quite quickly in a physical sense within a six week period, but mentally you would be a very long way behind and the adjustment would take a long, long time to achieve (if you were ever able to catch up at all). If you were asking because a loved one or member of your family is in this state, then please know my thoughts are with you and try not to pay too much attention to anything online.  Instead go with the words of your consultant and avoid other opinions of any kind.  Alternatively, if this was just out of interest, then I hope I have helped to elucidate the issue somewhat.  Take care. ",

            "answer_text": "Comas are caused by several medical or environmental issues, from meningitis to a drug overdose to a hard blow to the head. But the idea of a uniform \"coma state\" is a myth. The unconsciousness of a coma comes in varied forms. A state of prolonged unconsciousness regarded as a coma is classed as a vegetative state (in which the body makes movements and may grunt or yawn, but has no reaction to stimuli).Catatonia (where there's no movement or response of any kind), or brain death, in which the brain function is destroyed, but some of the body's autonomic functions can possibly continue. There are different clinical ways to assess coma severity on a scale, by testing things like the eye's iris reflex and motor movement.If you can be awakened \u2014 for instance, if you're in a stupor, which means you're pretty heavily unconscious but can be aroused with some effort \u2014 you're not technically in a coma. (A medically induced coma, by contrast, ends when the drugs that are inducing the coma are stopped, thus arousing the person.) Comas are by definition states from which you can't be aroused. Coma All of the following criteria must be evident on bedside examination: No eye opening and absence of sleep-wake cycles on EEG.No evidence of purposeful motor activity.No response to command.No evidence of language comprehension or expression.Inability to discretely localize noxious stimuli.Vegetative State All of the following criteria must be evident on bedside examination: No evidence of awareness of self or environment.No evidence of sustained, reproducible, purposeful, or voluntary behavioral responses to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.No evidence of language comprehension or expression.Intermittent wakefulness manifested by the presence of sleep-wake cycles.Sufficiently preserved hypothalamic and brain-stem autonomic functions to permit survival with medical and nursing care.Bowel and bladder incontinence.Variably preserved carian-nerve reflexes and spinal reflexes.Minimally Conscious State At least one of the following criteria must be clearly evident on bedside examination: 1 Simple command following.Gestural or verbal yes/no responses.Intelligible verbalization.Movements or affective behaviors that occur in contingent relation to relevant environmental stimuli and are not attributable to the reflexive activity. Any of the following examples provide sufficient evidence for this criterion:Pursuit eye movement or sustained fixation that occurs in direct response to moving or salient stimuli.Episodes of crying, smiling, or laughter in response to the linguistic or visual content of emotional but not neutral topics or stimuli.Vocalizations or gestures that occur in direct response to the linguistic content of comments or questions.Reaching for objects that demonstrates a clear relationship between object location and direction of reach.Touching or holding objects in a manner that accommodates the size and shape of the object.People in a coma will not age like people who are conscious and living life. Without regular use, the muscles atrophy. The part of the brain that was damaged initially (to trigger the coma) might deteriorate as a result of inflammation or \"maintenance\" responses to the area. However, stress is low. The heart still beats, the lungs still breathe, etc. For example, A 50-year old who awoke from a 30-year coma would look like a 50-year-old, but with much-reduced muscle tone and severe cognitive deficits.

            "answer_text": "Of course they do! Fantasy and science fiction aside, coma is not some sort of limbo where the body is suspended in space/time for as long as the spell lasts. Nope. Coma literally means your consciousness ie the part of your brain that interacts with your surroundings and yourself is altered. This means that while a CERTAIN portion of your brain (to be more specific, the prefrontal cortex) is \"asleep\", most of the rest of it is still active, and ALL the other parts of your body are still working. It is important to note that the brain was built rather wonderfully, most of your body functions are controlled unconsciously by a structure known as the brainstem. That is why even asleep you can breathe and your heart beats and so on. Coma is really just a deep sleep, scientifically. The brain patterns are very similar. The difference is sleep is stopped by a strong stimulus while coma continues despite even painful stimuli. I'm taking time to explain this to make you see that you'll age almost as fast as someone who is not in a coma, because you're more or less just sleeping. If you're well fed and well taken care of, your body cells will keep growing and multiplying and aging at more or less the same rate, all controlled by your brainstem. I don't agree with the answers talking about muscle atrophy and cardiac load. Aging is not a load-dependent process. Masons, for example, do not age faster than bankers. Aging is a cellular proces. Masons may display signs of age more because their lives are tougher, but it doesn't mean they age faster. Someone in a coma ages more or less just as fast as someone not in one. All the other things about coma are true: atrophy, malnutrition and so on are real concerns. But the aging process is the same. Except for the mind of course. Your brain will have aged, but not your mind. Hope this helps!!! ",

            "answer_text": "1. Growth in Coma s very slow.2. The recovery rate in Coma differs from person to person.3. There aren't many defined patterns of recovery and death in Coma.4. The longer the person is in a coma, the more profound and devastating are the changes suffered by his/her body.5. It's very difficult to start living a normal and routine life even post recovery. en.wikipedia.orgElaine Esposito - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Elaine Esposito (December 3, 1934 \u2013 November 25, 1978) holds the record for longest coma according to the Guinness World Records, having lost consciousness in 1941 and eventually dying in that condition more than 37 years later.[1][2] In her lengthy coma she showed states of both deep sleep and open-eyed unconsciousness and she grew slightly to 85 pounds (39 kg).[1] americanhospice.orgComa and Persistent Vegetative State: An Exploration of Terms | American Hospice Foundation What happens to the body of the person in a prolonged coma or a PVS? How many of us have seen a movie or television show where a person has been in an unresponsive coma for years, then suddenly wakes up one day, is fully alert, fully functional, and walks away with full strength, looking the same as the day he/she fell into the coma (except, perhaps, for the growth of a beard)? The belief that an irreversible coma or a PVS is a stable non-progressive condition is inaccurate. Although the brain lesion may not be changing or expanding, the changes occurring in the body are relentlessly progressive: Muscles waste away, and limbs may become contracted and immoveable. The person has a pre-disposition to develop recurrent pneumonia, due to immobility and an inability to keep secretions out of the lungs. Lungs may scar and collapse over time. The person has a predisposition to develop recurrent urinary tract infections, especially if a tube or Foley catheter has been inserted into the bladder to drain urine. These infections not uncommonly become generalized, spreading to the bloodstream and causing sepsis, a life threatening infection of the blood. Skin breakdown and ulcers occur commonly, since the person is unable to move and is incontinent, with no ability to control passage of urine or stool. Once formed, these wounds are very difficult to heal on a permanent basis. www.bbc.comMichael Schumacher: Coma challenges - BBC News Put simply, the effects of brain injury can be devastating and last a lifetime. It can change every aspect of you: walking, talking, thinking and feeling. It can change personalities as well as capabilities.However, we know that, with the right help at the right time, there can be life after brain injury. ",

            "answer_text": "A great quote by Albert Einstein states: 'The field is the sole governing agency of the particle'. The invisible force (the field) is responsible for shaping the material world (the particle).  To understand the character of a person's body or health, we must consider the role of the invisible energetic field as a primary influence.   The energy field can be thought of as a grid of fine lines which run criss-cross throughout the whole Universe and through every living being, thereby connecting every part of creation to each other.                                                                               The energy field, or Aura, is the electro magnetic field surrounding an object.This energy field surrounds and runs through the body, holding within it information which reflects the current physical, mental, emotional and spiritual condition of the individual. Disease begins as an imbalance in the body's energy field, and, if sustained, progresses on to the physical plane.  Whateverphysical conditions we place our body in directly affects the state of our cells and so on.  Our cells are regularly dying off and are being replaced. Which means the body renews itself and so retains health.  This however, can not be the case if the environment in which the cells have to live is toxic.  It is through lack of nutrients that cells become diseased.  This shut down of of vital nutrient supplies to the cells and organs is the cause of its demise.  This continues, in coma or otherwise. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not know the science of it, but I can relate two personal experiences with coma. After a car wreck in 1979 I was in a coma for 92 days. When I awoke I had complete situational awareness, knowing that I was in South Highlands Hospital ICU because my Dad practiced medicine there and I had grown up wandering those halls. My awakening was as I imagine yours was this morning, I simply woke up, though surprised at my situation. I  was stunned when told that I had been there for three months. I had no memory of the accident or any sense of time past. My cousin was in an accident a year later and was comatose with no physical capability except that sometimes his eyes were open, others not, with no sign of recognition of time or place for nine years until succumbing to pneumonia. His body did indeed age as one would expect for those nine years. Hope that helps! ",

He put this down to many years spent in an institution, away from the sun and the rigours of active life. I wonder if something similar might be true of coma patients. Nonetheless, the normal ageing process for organs will continue. At a cellular level, ageing happens due to the number of cell divisions which occurs in a human lifetime. Nothing will really make much of a difference to that. ",
