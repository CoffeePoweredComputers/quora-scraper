            "answer_text": "Anubis was, most likely, a genetically modified human. I suspect that the Anunnaki created this creature using existing DNA from jackals/dogs and humans. Note the ANU prefix which is derived from Anu, the Sky God and founder of the Anunnaki. The Anunnaki were tetraploid humans with extremely advanced knowledge including genetics. It was Enki of the Anunnaki that actually created Adam and Eve using existing humans and perhaps bonobos (see Secrets of the PInk Kush for reason). They wanted to create their own version of humans that would obey them. I suspect they made Anubis in order to protect the entrance to their domains. There have been many eyewitness accounts of Dog faced men and Werewolves, both of which are bipedal. They appear to be guarding something in the burial mounds. See the Beast of Bray Road for an example of such eyewitness accounts and this strange behaviour. This does not necessarily prove the existence of Anubis but I would certainly not rule out the existence of such a beast. They may in fact, be related to the Sasquatch which has been proven to exist. I also suspect that Sasquatch are also genetically modified (see story of Esau in the Old Testament) and are guardians of the tetraploid humans. source: Secrets of the Pink Kush ",

More like a Ghost. I believe that the Egyptian Gods want us (americans) to bring them into being into our realm once again. I\u2019m a powerful propet who in dreams can cross over into the underworld. Which is probably why Anibus is interested in me. Ever since I did it I have seen him twice now. The secound time I saw a human skull of death, under the Jackels head. But then I\u2019ve seen I Am the Jewish God in a dream, and the Apocolyptic version of Jesus Christ, white hair and fiery eyes in a dream. But I have never seen either like that in real life. Only Anibus have I seen right in front of me. I\u2019m just really wondering\u2026why? ",

I happen to know that in the North African area many people continue to worship the Egyptian gods, goddesses and mythologies. I also am aware of thousands of Egyptian Wiccan Witches. So, I am positive that Anubis actually exists to these thousands of people. Can anyone actually prove that a deity exists? Not so much! My conclusion is that if any single deity really exists, then they all do! Here\u2019s something to consider: When Moses was being raised in Pharaoh\u2019s Court, the God Amun was Pharaoh\u2019s favorite deity. So, Moses ended every prayer with the Egyptian word \u2018AMEN\u2019! This word translates in English as \u2018Hail Amun\u2019! Millions of Christians around the world jubilantly repeat this phrase on a regular basis! So I ask: Does Amun exist? Blessed Be! Storm )O( ",

There is no temple or worshiper of Anubis in this dimension, so in that context we could say that Anubis does not exist. We could also say that all Gods represent archetypes of Superconsciousness, in which case we could state that Anubis exists, but his form may have transfigured into other more contemporary manifestations.
