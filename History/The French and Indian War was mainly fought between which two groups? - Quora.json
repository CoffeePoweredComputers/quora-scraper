            "answer_text": "The French and Indian War was the North American theater of the Seven Years' War, which was arguably a world war involving most of the powers of Europe but was mostly between England and France in North America.  In North America, the French and the Indians were allies, and mutual enemies of the English and the colonists in North America.   An aside: George Washington started his military career as an English officer in this war.  The cost of the war crushed English finances, so they raised taxes on the colonies, which ultimately led to the American Revolution. ",
