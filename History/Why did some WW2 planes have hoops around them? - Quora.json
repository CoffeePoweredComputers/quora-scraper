            "answer_text": "They were mine-sweeping aircraft. The hoop was a degaussing loop used to safely detonate magnetic sea mines, by simulate the presence of a surface vessel and its effect on the local magnetic field. Although they could cover large areas quickly and safely, the minesweeper planes had several drawbacks: They were only useful in shallow waters such as river estuaries, harbours and their approches;To be effective the planes had to fly at low level, below 500\u2032. Before the development of moderns sensors and auto-pilots this was dangerous, especially if done for long periods.There was no practical method to clearly mark areas which had been swept by the planes;They were only effective against magnetic mines. As with terrestrial mine fields it was common practice to mix several types of sea mine in the same area.As a result, although the experimental conversions usually remained in use until the War\u2019s end, they were not mass produced. For instance the RAF only had fifeteen minesweeper planes. They were mostly used to make a preliminary sweep of a suspected mine field, before conventional minesweepers moved in to conduct a more thorough sweep. Aircraft used, or tested, as minesweepers included the Vickers Wellington (RAF), Consolidated Catalina (USN), and Blohm & Voss Bv 138 and Junkers Ju52/3M by the Luftwaffe. ",
