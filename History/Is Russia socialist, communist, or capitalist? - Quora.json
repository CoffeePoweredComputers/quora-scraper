            "answer_text": "To understand today\u2019s Russia, we must slightly delve into what the USSR was, and what China is today. Both USSR and China started out as Communist nations, but have today metamorphozed into capitalistic oligarchies. The USSR was an oligarchy, where the topmost officials of the state controlled all wealth for themselves, and trickled some of it down to their subordinates. However, because the nation was officially \u201ccommunist\u201d it did not allow the setting up new businesses lines, and therefore new founts of income to be had. For example China, a purely oligarchic system, allows the setting up of private enterprises as long as the proprietor pays allegiance to the Communist Party officially, and passes on donations, commissions, bribes etc to the local party members unofficially. The bigger the enterprise, the closer the business owner is to the higher echelons of the party. Jack Ma for example, is quite close to the circle of Xi Jinping. The Russia of today is an oligarchy, not too different from China. However, unlike China, the business magnates of Russia are the topmost government officials themselves, or their close friends. When the USSR imploded, ex-KGB officers (like Putin) pounced on the erstwhile state-owned oil & gas companies, mining companies etc to give ownership to themselves (or their friends). Unlike Xi Jinping of China, Putin is a businessman and a multi-billionaire himself. Postscript: Its interesting to note that the US is also headed to an oligarchic system, although its approach is different from Russia, which is different from China. In the US, a clutch of companies i.e. FAAMG control all our data, a few oil companies control all energy supply, a few retailers control most retail and so on. The representatives of these companies fund the election campaigns of Mayors, Governors and the President of the US. In return, they get rules written for themselves in the regulatory rule-book or even the constitution. Over a period of time, the US will look indistinguishable from a Russia or China, because it too shall be an absolute oligarchy. It already is a substantial oligarchy. ",

            "answer_text": "Each country has its own system suited to it. The labels like you mentioned have become irrelevant now, what with great mixing in last three decades. TODAY MOST EUROPEAN CAPITALIST SOCIETIES HAVE FAR GREATER OF WELFARE MEASURES THAN SO CALLED SOCIALIST STATES. BTW, FYI. There has never been a truly socialist or communist states in the world at anytime. Those who boasted of it were only state capitalist system, where, due to paucity of resources, state mopped up or \u201cextracted\u201d surplus from people by suppressing their consumption by drastic measures and invested it for industrial progress. That people were unwilling to undergo hardship, resulted in dictatorships there ",
