            "answer_text": "There are some accounts of the Lakota 'winkte' and how important they were. When the soldiers rounded up some Sioux bands and put them on holdings lands, they made everyone dress White. This just devastated the winkte, and they were abused and derided by soldiers and often committed suicide. This grieved the bands deeply and outraged them. They tried to defend them but the soldiers wouldn't listen. In my band, we didn't even have a word for homosexual, so we borrow someone else's word but it's derogatory. As I understand it, there's a lot of homophobia still in Canada, gay-bashing, etc., but this was from White Canadians. Hopi have the concept \"butterfly person\", and there's a West Coast tribe that explains eight genders (Noel may know), and the Mayan gender system is also multiple. The only story Iiyuu or Innu have that I know of is not one of homosexuality, but of a trickster who dons women's clothing in order to sneak into the moon lodge. This is not cool (but, as the story goes, the ladies loved it! hahah). This guy is referred to as \"i-coo-coo-a\" (same as Wolverine). Clearly, though, he's hetero, whatever his clothes were. The violation was not wearing women's clothes, it was going into their sacred space in disguise. In our language, animate vs inanimate genders: the male genitalia and the hair are \"inanimate\", basically, not important. So, we don't even have a lot of really sexually vulgar stories or references, just one that I know of (think it's Plains Cree?) where a guy was over-sexed and tried to jump on everything he could until he finally jumped on another guy, so a Mitew came in and set him straight: castrated him and stuck a wooden stick in his belly in a public \"ceremony\" to remind him that his sex drive was not an important matter. That \"cured\" him. Again, it didn't matter that he jumped another guy, but that he would not stop obsessing over his inanimate parts and could not fulfill his functions to his family, wife or band - in other words, he refused to go hunting, he was so obsessed with sex and his size. Sexuality is too complex for politics, if you ask me. Politics and religion just screw it all up, and society reflects those institutions of its own creation, so, all this bashing, we do this to ourselves and our loved ones by perpetuating gender bias, in the first place.

            "answer_text": "There are hundreds of tribal nations, and so the attitudes would obviously vary. But, traditionally, most tribal groups did not have a rigid, institutionalized, religiously-reinforced hatred of homosexuality either. In comparison to the Abrahamic traditions, it was not universally condemned.  That kind of hate has to be constructed, taught and perpetuated by religious directive.  In some tribes, homosexuals or those that did not conform to a binary gender role could even be highly regarded.  Just speaking broadly, I'd say most tribes didn't hate them or revere them...they were simply accepted. They were part of a family and a community. However, it seems that there would often be some expectation of fitting into a certain niche, even if that was an alternate gender. Everyone had a role and a job to do within the larger community. So, for example, a biological male that didn't fit with the traditional heterosexual male model, might dress as a female/work in female positions, and they might even speak in female form (if the language used gender specific constructions). But, even that was not completely prescriptive, for all tribes. ",
