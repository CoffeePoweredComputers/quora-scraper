            "answer_text": "In a cricket game, it is quite unpredictable to say who is going to win before even the tournament starts. But by analyzing the team members, venue, schedule, and compatibility, one can predict the few teams which can win the game. In the case of Chennai super kings, let's see and calculate their odds. The team of the 2020 Chennai Super kings consists of M S Dhoni, Shardul Thakur, KM Asif Deepak Chahar, Imran Tahir, Karn Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, N Jagadeesan, Monu Kumar, Mitchel Santner, Ravindra Jadeja, Lungi Ngidi, Kedhar Jadav, Dwayne Bravo, Ruturaj Gaiwaid, Murali Vijay, Faf du Plessis, Ambati Rayudu, Shane Watson, Sam Curran, Piyush Chawla, Josh Hazlewood, and R Sai Kishore. The compact team is strong in batting as well as bowling aspects. With MS Dhoni as the captain, the team's position becomes more strong but will it win or not is a matter of doubt because CSK has been a strong contender to every team but has only won the title twice. This year the IPL is scheduled at Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah at venues where IPL has never been played. So we cannot predict the venue compatibility as a team. The history, record, and the experience of the CSK team is good if we see. But it's unpredictable if it indeed will win the title. For bettors who want to put their money on CSK, I will suggest putting your money on the semi-final match. CSK is going to be in the semi-finals, but the final game is unpredictable. Betting on online sites is fun and pretty easy. I am an online gambler at Parimatch India. I've earned a lot through betting on previous IPL seasons and you can do the same. Parimatch India offers an impressive bonus up to rupees 8000 for the new users. It is an effortless method to create an account in the user-friendly site and start earning. They also have an online game platform called the Video Poker, where you can play poker with different online dealers. ",

            "answer_text": "This is cricket and anything can happen in it, you can\u2019t say who will win till the last ball (eg.- IPL12 FINAL ) We can guess that which team is going to win. According to me there are three teams this time which seems to be strong. They are CSK, MI, RCB. This time RCB squad is most powerful in previous 12 seasons of IPL. The chances of RCB is little higher as compared to CSK. CSK will miss suresh raina this IPL as he is one of the best players in CSK. If you are IPL/Cricket fan than do watch this video - search unity factz on YOUTUBE and watch amazing cricket video. Hope you gets your answer. Thanks for reading. ",
