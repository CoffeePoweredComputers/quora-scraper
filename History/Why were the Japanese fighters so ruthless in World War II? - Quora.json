            "answer_text": "\u201cCOMPARISONS ARE INSIDIOUS\u2026\u201d - Buddha Yes, no one can excuse the atrocities of Imperial Japan leading up to and during the Second World War. The Japanese military was exceptionally xenophobic, nationalistic and cruel; flag-bearers of a prosperous and rapidly growing island nation that felt besieged by ruthless colonial empires; men of a hard-working and extremely disciplined nation evolved from many centuries of feudal and militaristic rule. That they were so cruel to their enemies partly sprang from the cold fact of their own cruelty to themselves. It was a battle-hardened and undefeated modern military which had brutally occupied Korea, Taiwan, Manchuria, and much of China in the 3 decades or so before World War II. Its cruelty only deepened after it was ordered to thoroughly and systematically strip all the wealth and cultural artifacts from those subdued territories while repressively \u2018japanifying\u2019 and secretly policing every aspect of life. Their highly successful occupations gave them a supreme self confidence that validated cruelty. (Photos below are original portraits taken by the Japanese government during the war\u2026 They were bought on ebay, hence watermarking from the seller\u2019s ebay photo of the photo\u2026)     Japan was also a rapidly industrializing nation abruptly adopting Western ways, and thus most ordinary Japanese people resented and distrusted foreigners. Ruled by fanatical militarists and the Zaibatsu - - feudalistic family-owned industrial and financial conglomerates with politically protected monopolies - - the common man lived through jarring changes and at the same time was taught racial superiority and to hate colonialism and foreigners. Though Christianity had long been persecuted as a threat to the \u2018Japanese way of life\u2019. Then it only became easier for Japan to act cruelly because their colonialist-hating, imperialistically-ambitious government never officially ratified acceptance of the Geneva Convention\u2019s articles of war. They had walked out on the League of Nations in 1933, and the next year they renounced the Washington/London Naval Treaties to embark on aggressively building a Navy specifically designed to overwhelm and defeat the U.S. Pacific Fleet with state-of-the-art British-designed warships. Supposedly resource-starved and besieged, Japan had evolved so far and so fast by 1938 that it had the world\u2019s 7th highest GDP. They felt beholden to no one, and looked down upon virtually every other nation and race as inferior\u2026 Meanwhile, the Japanese government had been evolving Shinto into becoming an all-pervasive state religion that worshipped the emperor as a living god and asserted a divine destiny for ruling \u2018all corners of the world\u2019 - - hakko ichiu. Hakk\u014d ichiu - Wikipedia Militarily and politically this meant the Japanese believed in victory by any and all means necessary; divine ends justified the means. Shinto, as subverted by the militarists, had no room or concern for compassion towards anyone. In fact, subverted Shintoism coupled with subverted bushido, encouraged cruelty both within the military and towards the rest of the world. When China\u2019s capital, Nanjing, fell to the Imperial Japanese Army in December of 1937, China stubbornly relocated their capital refusing to surrender. The entire world looked on in horror, as the Japanese quickly made an example of the city, savagely raping and slaughtering hundreds of thousands of civilians within a very short period. The Rape of Nanjing became a byword of fear in China and to the wider world, but also an unexpected rallying call against Japanese atrocities. After the massacre, the United States quickly intervened with diplomacy, then with trade restrictions in 1938 and 1940. The Pacific Fleet was moved from the U.S. west coast to Hawaii as a further deterrent in 1940. Then, after Japan invaded northern French Indochina and broke promises to not occupy the entire country, and after refusing to withdraw, Franklin Roosevelt instituted a devastating oil and metals embargo in 1941. Over 90% of Japan\u2019s oil flow was thus cut with the stroke of a pen. It only served to further justify Japan\u2019s decades of military build-up, aggression, and cruelty. Without warning or prior declarations, the Japanese simultaneously attacked Malaya, Thailand, Hawaii, Singapore, Wake Island, Midway, Guam, Hong Kong, and the Philippines, all within 10 hours. These attacks led to a tsunami of attrocities unleashed across the Pacific signaling an intent to rule by fear. Cruelty was by then fully institutionalized within the Japanese military and strongly encouraged. Almost religiously, Japanese forces fervently believed their own propaganda and that they were truly destined to rule both Asia and the world; that they were invincible. And cruelty had hatefully become the \u201cJapanese way\u201d. (Below, wartime photo released by the Japanese government for re-publication by Japanese newspaper as part of a propaganda series of Imperial triumphs\u2026 Here they take over oil fields in the Dutch East Indies).  Within just a few months, Japan\u2019s lightning advance dismantled a colonial empire in Asia that had taken the European powers centuries to acquire. Suddenly Japan controlled over 20 million square miles of the earth\u2019s surface; more surface area than the British Empire which had recently commanded 30% of the earth\u2019s land mass and 25% of its population; five times more territory than Nazi Germany would ever control; well over double the size of the great Mongol Empire at its 14th century peak or the territory of the Soviet Union (blocking U.S. efforts for the entire war to use Soviet territory to base bombers within easy range of Japan\u2019s home islands). Week after devastating week, the prophecy of hakko ichiu and merciless notions of racial superiority was being convincingly proven. Hirohito's War (Frances Pike, \u201cHirohito\u2019s War: The Pacific War 1941\u201345\u201d) The Japanese offensive was simply incredible. By June 1942, their occupations ranged from Manchuria in the north to the Owen Stanley Range of Papua New Guinea in the south, and from India\u2019s Assam in the west to Kiska, \u201cAmerican Soil\u201d in the Aleutian Islands and the Far East. The invincible Japanese suddenly controlled more of the earth\u2019s total surface than any other power in human history. Japanese aircraft carriers cruised the Bay of Bengal unchallenged. Imperial submarines sank merchant ships in Sydney Harbor and off the coast of California. They had joined Hitler\u2019s Axis of evil and also signed a \u201cnon-aggression\u201d pact with the largest country in the world, the Soviet Union. Again and again, their projected power and success seemed to justify and validate their Bushido code, Shinto destiny, ruthlessness and cruelty. Rapid territorial expansion and dominance went to Japanese heads, not only in Hirohito\u2019s war cabinet but in Japan\u2019s streets, homes, and schools alike; they widely and deeply believed the fevered pitch of their own propaganda. Again, vain-glorious ends justified the arrogant and atrocious means. Japanese propaganda became self fulfilling. Atrocities became the new normal. Opium factories were built throughout China and Manchuria to addict and pacify civilians, and to ferret out the last few pieces of gold from every vegetable garden. Human medical experiments on prisoners and unwitting Chinese civilians were practiced from 1933 until 1945. Biological and chemical weapons were used. The Japanese were untouchable, above all laws, and entitled. See Unit 731 - Wikipedia According to Japan\u2019s cruel bushido code, all captured soldiers and sailors deserved death and dishonor and to be forgotten. Japanese families were expected to disown any son who had allowed himself to be captured, even as they themselves were socially estranged for the dishonor. Consequently, when Japanese soldiers were captured, the government would not notify or aid their families. The Japanese believed this was how you won a \u2018total war\u2019. Consequently, the Japanese treated Allied prisoners with cruelty and as inferiors, in part, because they assumed and were taught that the Allies did the same thing. Hence, although very few Japanese prisoners died in Allied camps (less than 1%, in fact), over 40% of all American and 25% of all British POW\u2019s held by the Japanese died in captivity\u2026 The disparity only discouraged Allied efforts towards taking Japanese prisoners, which in turn helped validate Japanese training. Mutual hatred often trumped the practical value of gathering intelligence from prisoners. If one side wouldn\u2019t take prisoners then by God the other wouldn\u2019t either. And relatively few American and Japanese prisoners were taken. Only 40,000 Japanese troops out of the total 8.4 million who served during the war ever allowed themselves to be captured by the Allies (excluding roughly 500,000 taken by the Soviets in Manchuria mostly after Japan\u2019s surrender). Only 27,000 Americans were captured by the Japanese out of nearly 3.6 million Americans who served in the Pacific. Below, General Jonathan Wainwright, the highest ranking American POW during the war, suffered great hardships in Japanese captivity but he never gave in and never gave up; his hard glare and extreme weight loss tells the story of man\u2019s inhumanity to man, but also of Wainwrights incredible iron will and his refusal to be dishonored. This U.S. Army Signal Corps photo was taken shortly after Japan\u2019s surrender when he was freed. Later, Congress and President Truman awarded Wainwright the Medal of Honor for his courageous example and fortitude. (Shamefully, MacArthur protested it. ) Then again, due to orders of Hirohito dating back to 1937, only 56 Chinese POW\u2019s survived to be released after Japan\u2019s surrender. Wainwright and any surviving American had been a exceedingly lucky. (Below: U.S. Signal Corps Photo, 1945)  BUT\u2026 Japan had no monopoly on cruelty. If we\u2019re honest, we should all double-check our own nationalistic, racially-tainted perspectives. We should question our own propaganda. The Second World War brought out incredible hate, savagery and brutality in millions of men from ALL nationalities, holding all kinds of beliefs. Again and again, wars have taught the world about the extremely dark potential which lives in all humanity, yet we persist in vilifying by nationality, ethnicity, religious beliefs, and other labeling. Americans only need to remember the cruel and unconstitutional internments of 130,000 Japanese-Americans to see that any nation or group of human beings can lose its way. Meanwhile, genocide has continued around the world despite the abominations of the Holocaust. The problem of systemized evil is universal. Karl Marlantes, American novelist and former Vietnam veteran U.S. Marine, who was awarded the Navy Cross, the Bronze Star, two Navy Commendation Medals for valor, two Purple Hearts, and ten air medals, had this to say in Ken Burns\u2019 and Lynn Novick\u2019s documentary\u201cThe Vietnam War\u201d (2017), episode 5: \u201cOne of the things that I learned in the war is that we're not the top species on the planet because we're nice. We are a very aggressive species; it is in us. People talk a lot about how well the military turns kids into killing machines, and I'll always argue that it's just finishing school. What we do with civilization is that we learn to inhibit and rope in these aggressive tendencies, and we have to recognize them. I worry about a whole country that doesn't recognize them, because think of how many times we get ourselves into scrapes as a nation because we're always the 'good guys'. Sometimes, I think if we thought we weren't always the good guys, we might actually get into less wars.\u201d Finally, a surprising 1943 classified U.S. War Department training manual weighs in as well: \u201cTHE MOST COMMON SHORT-COMINGS IN THE TRAINING OF BATTALION AND REGIMENTAL S-2 [Intelligence] PERSONNEL AND SOME SUGGESTIONS TO OVERCOME THESE, by Private Frank B. Sargent, 34th Infantry Division\u2026 \u201cTHE SUGGESTED PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAINING FOR INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL. \u201c\u2026 In the training of the American soldier there is one point which, unfortunately so far, has been overlooked. We may call it \u201cpsychological preparation for combat.\u201d \u201cWe had the general impression, at the front, that newly arrived American soldiers did not realize the nature of war; neither did they have a conception of the psychology of the enemy. American soldiers are innocent and trusting; good-hearted and confiding. They are not at all aggressive. Unlike the British and French, Americans have never seen enemy actions in the raw. Maybe they saw ruins of bombed buildings in England, but they used to regard them as if they were remains of ancient Pompeii, or Carthage. The young soldiers could never visualize the human beings who used to live in those buildings and who are now dead. Americans never had to drag the torn bodies of loved ones out of smashed buildings, or to fight for survival. Unlike the French, they were never subjected to terror. In other words, Americans never had any reasons to hate anybody. When American troops first come to the front they do not hate their enemy. But if you don't hate your enemy you will fear him. If his determination to kill you is stronger than your determination to kill him you will also fear him. \u201cThe Psychology of Hate: \u201cThe British and French know what they are fighting for because they have been in this war a long time, and the Germans believe that they do too. The British fight for their very lives; they fight to stop the Germans from bombing their homes, to stop them from killing their families. The British front line soldier slashes forward without mercy. He hates the enemy. \u201cThe American soldier is different. He is fair-minded and thinks that the enemy will be fair too. He does not really want to kill, because he does not hate - - yet. Subconsciously he thinks of war as a game where the umpire\u2019s whistle will stop it before it gets too rough. He cannot imagine anybody wanting to kill him, and so he commits all the mistakes which have cost so many lives already. Enemy prisoners marvel at the thoughtlessness with which American soldiers move. They cannot understand why Americans never even think of taking cover; why they don't follow through; why they can be bluffed and trapped so easily. \u201cI know so well those men who were cut to ribbons at the KASSARINE PASS, and I know why they were thrown into confusion, panicked by attacks, and accepted their fate almost paralyzed. When they jumped into foxholes to let the tanks roll over them and were bayonetted in these foxholes by the Infantry that came behind the tanks, they died with an astonished look on their faces, as if they wanted to ask: \u201cCould that be possible, would they really do that?\u201d \u201cWe are prone to regard the Italians with a mixture of contempt and pity. But the boys I knew, who were blown to bits by Italian hand grenades would not think so. If they could come to life again they would not feel pity for the poor, coerced Italians; they would go after them, until they had killed every last one. So would the medical orderlies I knew, who wanted to treat German casualties and lost their arms by booby traps. \u201cThe psychology of hate is such that until John Doe learns to hate he will be no good. As long as he regards his opponent as a good fellow, a man who, after all, does not really want to fight and kill him, John Doe will go into combat carelessly and not aggressively. He won't go and look for the enemy; he won't want to kill, to destroy; to win. When the enemy proves to be stronger, John Doe will not hold out and counter attack; try to beat the enemy with the last ounce of energy, beat him by his stronger will. John Doe will probably give way, get panicky, and want to leave alone in order to be let alone. He will fall into traps and never lay any traps himself. He will trust anybody and never suspect. His slogan will not be \u201cgo get the bastards\u201d but \u201clet\u2019s not give away our positions.\u201d When lead starts flying thickly, he\u2019ll want to run. \u201cIt is in the nature of hate that it can be instilled or acquired. It was instilled into German, Italian, or Japanese soldiers until it became a habit with them. The American soldiers acquired it after they had been at the front for a while. Then, of course, they went ahead and nothing could stop them. Then they whistled when they threw hand grenades. But then it was late, and we had lost so many unnecessarily. \u201cHate is like gin. It takes awhile, and then, suddenly, it hits you. After you have seen your buddies killed; after you see bodies, or what\u2019s left of them, piled up for burial; when you realize that they are after you, too; when it finally connects in your mind that moral code does not exist in this war, then you will begin to hate, and want to retaliate. A soldier has to develop the primitive instinct to kill anybody who threatens him or his own. Beyond that he must learn to kill before the other can get at him. \u201cUntil he hates the enemy with every instinct and every muscle, he will only be afraid. (Below - another U.S. Signal Corps Photo)  \u201cThis is primitive psychology, a cruel and inhuman one. But war is all that. Hate must become first nature to a soldier and make him want to use every trick. We went out for days to look for the enemy. We fired at anything that moved, we laid booby traps all over the front, because we wanted to kill. We only had to remember\u2026 \u201cIn the training of intelligence personnel, this psychological factor is of greatest importance. Intelligence personnel, being of intellectually higher standards, must realize that their job will be to know and outwit the enemy. As counter-intelligence personnel they will have to detect and neutralize the enemy and his agents. They must learn not to trust. They must be able, through their specialized training, to warn the men in the lines. \u201cAs an example we could mention the numerous casualties suffered due to Arab espionage. Our men trusted the Arabs, made friends with them, tolerated them near positions. Then the bombs and shells came and fell right into those positions where the Arabs had previously been. Dead men don't need to hate any more, but the survivors learned their lesson. \u201cIntelligence personnel must be trained not to trust anybody; to suspect lies in firm assurances of friendship. They cannot afford to make fine distinctions between good and bad in native populations. They must understand that the lives of other fellows depends on them. The boys in the foxholes like to live too, and hate to die just because some intelligence men had big hearts and could not understand that spies and agents are ostensibly friendly people. \u201cIt would be a good thing if newly arrived intelligence personnel could be given a chance to visit hospitals, and hear some of the stories our casualties would have to tell. They should be given talks by experienced intelligence and counter-intelligence men (American, British, French). They should read casualty lists and be told why these men had to die, and how they died. They should be given the shock of their lives, now, in the rear areas, in order that they be prepared psychologically to such a pitch that they want nothing else but to get in and retaliate. \u201cAfter that, they should be taught how.\u201d \u2026 And so it played out: Americans quickly learned to hate the Japanese, exchanging cruelties for cruelties; in hellish island campaigns of torturous attrition ending in total annihilation for the Japanese defenders, again and again, until the Americans were finally within reach of the Japanese home islands. Then relentless American fire-bombings wiped out tinderbox city after city. Still the Japanese stubbornly - - even cruelly - - refused to surrender, ignoring the Potsdam ultimatum and all broadcasts and airdropped warning leaflets. So the atomic bombs were dropped\u2026 It took the intense hatred and terrors and uncountable casualties of napalming first in Europe, where it was terror for terror, to numb and grease the slippery slope towards the actual use of atomic weapons. But by July-August of 1945, it had become surprisingly easy to justify using such weapons. Its been nothing short of an unexplained biblical miracle that they\u2019ve never been used since. So far\u2026 Yes, the Japanese were unspeakably cruel, and yet below we can see the intensely crowded, largely-wooden city of Tokyo, napalmed to unimaginable fire-storms\u2026 (Below, once classified Army Airforce Photo: 1945 Firebombing mission over Tokyo)  So many people persist in comparing cruelties, and yet how can wartime cruelties ever be acceptably defined for fair and meaningful measurement and comparison? More importantly, WHY are we asking this question about \u201ccruelty\u201d? Why measure and compare cruelty at all - - or by nationality? Why single out \u201cJapan\u201d - - all Japanese people, or just the Japanese military as an institution - - as somehow exceptionally evil, rather than simply (and instructively) human? To prevent such cruelties from ever happening again? Then why, why, why, after all the international war crime tribunals\u2026 After countless Holocaust museums\u2026 After establishing the United Nations\u2026 And after CENTURIES of war stories do we STILL continue to suffer not only the extreme cruelties of war and repression, but genocide as well? \u2026Post World War II Genocides in Bosnia and Serbia, Bangladesh, the Soviet Union, China, Cambodia, Rwanda/Burundi, Syria, Burma, Iraq, Central Africa, Sudan, East Timor, Somalia, Guatemala, and still others\u2026 Religious, ethnic, ideological/political\u2026 GENOCIDES seemingly everywhere, within all races, marching on? Comparing cruelties is something in us that can only lead to cruelty; it only seeks to justify retribution\u2019s of cruelty. Comparisons are insidious\u2026 Perhaps a better question would be: why has the Japanese government steadfastly denied and distorted their atrocious history; history that the entire world accepts? Why have they refused to acknowledge, apologize, or to compensate for the massive looting of their brutal occupations? ",

            "answer_text": "I am going to have to give some cultural background to help answer the question. Japanese people in general, and the soldiers in particular, had several philosophies literally beaten into them. A deeply ingrained concept of Yamato-damashii (\u5927\u548c\u9b42, \"Japanese spirit\") or Yamato-gokoro (\u5927\u548c\u5fc3, \"Japanese heart/mind\") was implanted in every Japanese clear back to the Heian_period (794-1185 AD). Ironically, it might be noted that \u201cHeian\u201d means \u201cpeace\u201d in Japanese. This concept was that Japanese spirit and values were far superior to the spirit and values of any other culture. Yamato-damashii embodied the concepts of the Japanese being brave, daring, and having an indomitable spirit. So, each and every Japanese was imbued with the basic concepts necessary for them to know that they were better and superior to all other peoples. Another principle of Japanese doctrine was Hakk\u014d_ichiu(\u516b\u7d18\u4e00\u5b87) which was that the Japanese people, being superior to all others, were destined to rule. Hakk\u014d ichiu, literally \"eight crown cords, one roof\" (i.e. \"all the world under one roof\") meant that the Emperor of Japan was to rule an empire, not of just the islands, but also many conquered lands. Consequently, not just the people, but the military had the concept that whomever they conquered deserved it. They should be happy to have become a part of the enlightened ones even though the Japanese felt that all other peoples were lower than dogs. Gyokusai was a Japanese philosophy has been expressed as, \u201cBetter to be a shattered jewel than a roofing tile.\u201d The Gyokusai ideology reached its peak during WWII and was expressed in action, as honorable death (ichioku gyokusai, ie, shattering jewels into a million pieces) in combat was far preferable to living as a prisoner. This philosophy is outside Bushido or any religion and was part of the Japanese psyche applying to soldiers and civilians alike. What is Gyokusai? \u7389\u7815\u3068\u306f\u4f55\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046? The Japanese Army regularly chanted the mantra, \u201cWhether I float as a corpse in the waters or sink beneath the grasses of the mountainside I willingly die for the emperor,\u201d and concluded \u201cThe life of a warrior is like a cherry blossom which lasts but three days.\u201d There were many slogans but towards the end of the war one of them was, \u201cOne plane for one battleship. One boat for one ship. One man for one tank or ten men.\u201d Another slogan to indoctrinate the warrior spirit was, \u201cDuty is weightier than a mountain, but death is lighter than a feather.\u201d An example of the Japanese military mind was evident as early as the morning of December 7, 1941! Ensign Kazuo Sakamaki, who was captured unconscious when his submarine ran aground after the attack on Pearl Harbor requested to be shot or allowed to commit suicide. He became Prisoner of War #1. On the other side of Oahu, A Japanese D3A1 Carrier Bomber was shot down by a P-40 and the two members of the crew bailed out off shore. One died, but Petty Officer Goto made it to shore and was seen. A team from the 55thCoast Artillery approached him and demanded his surrender to which he replied with his pistols. Goto had recovered a pistol from the body of his other crew member and now, 4000 miles from Japan, all alone, with no food, water, or possible reinforcement, he fought to the death rather than surrender. Over Honolulu, as the attack of the second wave ended, 28-year-old Lieutenant Fusata Iida, commander of the Japanese 1st Shotai from the Soryu, found that his Zero was too badly damaged to make it back to the carrier, so he dove to his death in a Kamikaze dive crashing between the hangers at Kaneohe airfield. Now, part of the philosophy of Bushido was that to surrender was the greatest possible shame. To an oriental, shame was intolerable. It meant you had not just failed yourself, but your family, and especially your ancestors. So when it came to fighting, the average soldier felt that death was preferable to defeat, so they fought literally to death. Reading the statistics of battles in the Pacific during WWII is very sobering! These are the people who simply didn\u2019t surrender. They literally jump off of cliffs to their death before surrender. In 1943, at Buna, New Guinea, out of 14,000 Japanese troops, not one surrendered. In 1943, on Attu, Alaska, out of 2,500 troops, there were 28 prisoners, some wounded. On Tarawa, out of 3,600 troops, 17 Japanese surrendered. On Saipan, there were 32,000 troops, and there were 921 prisoners. On Peleliu, out of 10,900 Japanese soldiers, 19 were captured, along with 183 laborers. On Iwo Jima, there were 21,000 troops, and 216 surrendered and American losses were 7,000 killed and eighteen thousand wounded. In the Philippines, 56,263 Japanese soldiers were killed, but only 389 surrendered. Just in the battle for Manila, 1,000 US soldiers died, but the entire garrison of 17,000 Japanese soldiers fought and died to the very last man-and over 100,000 civilians were massacred. In the battle-of-okinawa , graves registration buried 110,701 dead and 7,401 were captured. Simply put, these are not an enemy you can scare. They didn\u2019t scare. They looked Death in the face up close and personal, face-to-face, eyeball-to-eyeball, and didn\u2019t blink. With very, very few exceptions, they simply didn\u2019t surrender. So now you know and understand the enemy, but why did they maltreat prisoners so badly? Because first of all, a prisoner had lost all honor. By surrendering, as explained above, according to the internalized mores of a Japanese soldier, a prisoner was lower than a dog. A prisoner had no honor and no respect. Anything done to a prisoner was acceptable since they were beings with no honor. In their own training as soldiers, they had been brutalized in ways a Marine would have found terrible. They were beaten by superiors for the slightest infraction or failure to obey orders. An open handed, full arm slap in the face was enough to stun a soldier as he was knocked to the ground. If their boots had the slightest bit of dirt on them at inspection, they had to LICK to boots clean. So if the lowliest private was treated that way, why would he, a Japanese soldier, treat a dog better than he was treated? And a prisoner was LOWER than a dog. Killing a prisoner was actually doing them a favor since his dishonor would be over. This attitude is what made it easy for them to use prisoners for bayonet practice. To use prisoners for target practice. To have a contest to see who could cut off the most heads. They weren\u2019t killing people, they were killing a lower form of animal life. ",
