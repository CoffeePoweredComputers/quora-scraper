            "answer_text": "Portugal was very powerful for about 100 years back in the XV -XVI century. It was not large nor powerful enough to keep all their colonies, but for a country wrecked by poverty, under constant attack from Spain and the Muslim world, what it accomplished was/is very significant. Other nations faced loss of colonies as well, but Portugal was the last colonial power to hang on to theirs. Not that I am particularly proud of that, or issues that came along the colonialism ride. However, in many areas of the globe where Portugal touched, there are still visible signs of Portuguese influence to this day in local society, physical anthropology, language, cuisine, culture, religion or architecture. For a country of barely one million inhabitants at the time, what Portugal accomplished cannot be ignored, nor easily swept aside by the desmissive hands of the ignorant, uninformed masses, including other ex-colonial powers who like to deride and criticize our modis operandi at the time, as if they were any better! Portugal gave us the world we know today with its own personal touch. That personal touch is a pleasant, delightful experience if/or when you go to Macau, Goa, or Cape Verde, and the incredible mesh of cultures that created beautiful people in beautiful lands like Brazil & S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 & Pr\u00edncipe, off the Gulf of Guine. When the Eurasians of Melaka in present day Malaysia still hang on to their Kristang language, a Portuguese dialect that although still endangered, 500 years after Portugal left Melaka, it is still spoken. When the Mata Biru of Aceh, Indonesia make the news because of their beautiful women with light skin, blue eyes, blind hair, they tell you about their most likely Northern Portuguese touch and heritage. This tells you something about the bond that keeps these Eurasians attached to their European Portuguese legacy, which many still cherish. Portugal showed the world that if there was ever a group of courageous, valient, seafaring people that conquered unknown fears, seas, political and physical barriers, attacks, invasions, monsters, misery, hunger, foreign lands, societies, and armies 3 x\u2019s + its size, they were my Portuguese ancestors, of which I am extremely proud for their courage, grit, sacrifice and determination. Amongst its many contributions, the Portuguese found, fought, lived, loved and died in areas of the world that even stronger and larger powers like Egypt, Greece, Rome, Vikings, Chinese and Muslims groups could not, or would not because\u2026they amongst the many possible reasons were afraid, we were NOT. Please do not let size, stature, history or GDP taint your view of the Portuguese. We have balls BIG balls, we also like to put them to use, no matter where we are. We were \u2018only\u2019 the pioneers of globalization centuries before Bill Gates and Steve Jobs even thought about it. So please do let respect and justice fall on Portugal, and the Portuguese, if only for that; we thank you! ",
