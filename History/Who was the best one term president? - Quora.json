            "answer_text": "James K Polk. He served just one term. When he was inaugurated, America came to an end, at the Mighty Mississippi River, when his term ended, America ended, at the Pacific Ocean. Texas jumped in and became part of America, on December 29th 1845, before Polk\u2019s first year in office. The sand that the Pacific Ocean was splashing on were not yet states, when Polk\u2019s term ended. They were territory\u2019s. Great Britain attempted to Grab Washington and half of Oregon. James Polk, told England \u201c54\u201340 or fight.\u201d Threatening another war with England and he meant it. Forgetting he was already at war in Mexico. His protege was Andrew Jackson, Polk\u2019s nickname was \u201cYoung Hickory.\u201d. . . Jackson taught him well. Gold was discovered in California, shortly before his term ended. Californians broke their neck, getting in the Union. Thousand\u2019s of others didn\u2019t care if California was in the Union or not, they were coming also, most were just walking along side their wagons. They were not allowed to bring their slaves, so the came without them. They did bring Gold Pans, and shovels, however. The Chinese also came, they weren\u2019t allowed to dig for gold, however, so they cooked soup, and washed clothes for those who were digging for gold. The Chinese went home rich, unlike most of the gold diggers. James K. Polk, did more for America in one term, than most of the other Presidents, would have done, if they had served three terms. On June 8th 1845 death came by and set Andrew Jackson free. A couple of months after Polk\u2019s term ended, June 15th 1849 he decided to go join Jackson. Hopefully, he succeeded. ",

            "answer_text": "HW Bush, Gerald Ford, and Jimmie Carter were good and decent men who, because of the times were not reelected. People hated Carter because of the Iran hostage situation but he wouldn\u2019t give in to the hostage-takers who wanted guns and cash in exchange for hostages. Of course, the Reagan people had no problem paying off the Iranians to get the hostages released. The Republican Party has gone steadily downhill since then with a real problem when it comes to ethics and the people they choose to run for office. The people who gave us the war on drugs, Middle East wars, and the near-collapse of the country because Trump decided the Coronavirus is a Democrat hoax and delayed doing anything about it until too late. It might be time to reorganize the party and look at the values they wish to project to the American people. It might be time to work for the American people and not for themselves. Corporations taking stimulus money, while their bank accounts are bulging with cash and never saying a word while the chief makes racist statements and does everything he can to destroy the institutions of the United States. The most corrupt bunch of public trough feeders in history. Trump companies getting stimulus money, getting rich off taxpayers. Cruz, Graham, McConnell, Nunes, Trump all lazy, corrupt, trouble makers who should be waiting tables down at the bar and grill, not representing hard-working, decent people. It\u2019s time to get rid of these old, ignorant relics and replace them with people who want to get the country moving again, stop the graft (the Trump grift), and the monster lobby. This isn\u2019t a Russian oligarchy. Trump and Putin are still working on it. ",
