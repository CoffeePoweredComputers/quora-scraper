            "answer_text": "The word was first used in Venice to denote the district of Cannaregio where the Venetian Jews were restricted to live beginning in 1516. The district was enclosed by guarded gates and no resident was allowed to leave from 6 p.m. every night to 12 p.m. the next day. The boats of the Christian guards scoured the surrounding canals to impede nocturnal violations. Although the Jews of Venice held important and lucrative positions in the city as physicians, bankers and merchants, they were considered alien and subject to harsh restrictions. This was true of every city of Europe. The nature of the various segregated Jewish areas ranged from affluent quarters, as in Venice, to places of horrible poverty, as in Rome. It was not until the conquest of the Venetian Republic in 1797 by general Napoleon that the restrictions were lifted. The gates were removed and all residents were free to live wherever they chose. By Didier Descouens - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, File:Canale di Cannaregio - Viewed from Grand Canal.jpg  There are various suggestions for the origin of the word, whose usage had become extended to segregated and densely packed quarters of other minority groups by 1899. A foundry for cannons was once located on the island that forms part of Venice, where in 1516 the Venetians restricted Jewish residence. Hence, it might be that the term is from the word for foundry in the Venetian dialect, gh\u00e8to, ultimately derived from the Latin JACTARE, meaning \u201cto throw,\u201d the definition being extended to mean \u201cto cast metal.\u201d Other possibilities have been put forth: ~~from Italian \u201cborghetto,\u201d \u201clittle town,\u201d from \u201cborgo,\u201d a Germanic word which has the English form \u201cburg.\u201d ~~from the Latin GIUDAICETUM, Jewish enclave. This is totally implausible from a phonetic point of view. ~~from the Hebrew \u201cget,\u201d \u201cbill of divorce,\u201d \u201cdeed of separation.\u201d This, however, is most likely a folk etymology as the leap from \u201cdivorce\u201d to \u201cplace of forced isolation\u201d is a mighty one to imagine. ~~from the Yiddish \u201cgehetkes,\u201d \u201cenclosed.\u201d ~~from the Italian word for Egypt, \u201cEgitto,\u201d a reference to the Israelites\u2019 stay in Egypt. Why would the Venetians confuse Jews with Egyptians? The mystery has not been fully resolved.

Word story In Italian, ghetto \u201cthe quarter of a city where Jews were obliged to live,\u201d dates from 1516 when the Venetians set aside an area for Jewish settlement, shut off from the rest of the city and provided with Christian watchmen. The etymology of ghetto is obscure, but several authorities derive it from Venetian dialect gh\u00e8to \u201c(iron) foundry\u201d (there was one at the site of the Jewish quarter).  In English, ghetto in its original meaning dates from the early 17th century. By the late 19th century, ghetto had extended its meaning to \u201ca section of a city, especially a thickly populated slum area, inhabited predominantly by members of an ethnic or other minority group.\u201d Israel Zangwill\u2019s novel Children of the Ghetto (published in 1892) is about the life and experiences of East European Jewish children in the East End of London.
