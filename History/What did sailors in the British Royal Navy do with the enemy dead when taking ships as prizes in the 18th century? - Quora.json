He recorded his 'adventures' in a set of fantastic diaries which I have read a number of times. An incredible passage describes a set of orders he passed out to his crew regarding dead mates and dead enemies.  \"Midshipman take a score of crew and the ship Chaplain to gather up the unfortunate dead crew mates. Have the Chaplain read the unfortunate men a blessing, prepare them for their final journey and cast them in too their watery graves. On completion of this sombre task please gather the bodies of the enemy and have the Chaplain pray for God to forgive them. When finished remove their clothing and send them to the stores. The plumpest of these unfortunate enemies should be harvested for their fuel. We need oil for the lanterns and these men should suffice. Please ensure that we DO NOT have another debacle like on our last journey Midshipman. The actions of some of your men was deplorable and anthropophagite actions will not be tolerated. When completed please consign their bodies to the depths.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Burial at sea, for all the dead.  No refrigeration meant burial at sea, even if they wanted to take them home, which most Navies did through WWII, at least, anyway. In the present peacetime Navy, when in casualties from accidents or terrorist actions are in the 25 or less category, the bodies are kept and sent  home for burial by their families. But in the event of hostilities or mass casualties (that the situation called for more possible hostile action without relief and possibly more casualties),  I'm pretty sure that burial at sea would be arranged.
