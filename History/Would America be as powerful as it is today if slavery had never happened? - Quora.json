            "answer_text": "I would argue no, you can't talk slavery without talking capitalism. During the middle of the 1800s, cotton became the world's largest commodity. The cheapest and best cotton came from the southern United States. Cotton was the great engine of antebellum America\u2019s rise to economic success. Cotton, \u201cdrove U.S. expansion, enabling the young country to grow from a narrow coastal belt into a vast, powerful nation with the fastest-growing economy in the world.\u201d The Industrial Revolution was, in large measure, a revolution in the production of textiles in Great Britain; that production depended on the import of inexpensive, high-quality cotton, and no place on the face of the earth fulfilled that demand as readily as the American South. Especially once Eli Whitney\u2019s \u201ccotton gin\u201d simplified the separation of the cotton boll from its seeds, Southern cotton production soared, from 36 million pounds in 1800, to 480 million pounds in 1835, then to 1.92 billion pounds by 1860, so that Southern cotton exports constituted 72% of all world cotton exports. By 1860, Southern cotton constituted 57% of all American exports. Compared to Northern grain agriculture, which exported only 5% of its total crop, Southern cotton plantations shipped 75% of their cotton abroad. But more than merely filling plantation owners\u2019 coffers, the profitability of cotton fueled two other developments. HFirst, it firmly cemented into place the use of slave labor as a production force. Second, it drew into its orbit a supporting cast of government and finance as its collaborators. Brokers and bankers serviced the transport and sale of slave-produced cotton; the U.S. government provided credit in the form of cheap land sales in the Mississippi Valley frontier; and slaves themselves were furnished by internal export from the worn-out agricultural lands of the upper South to the new cotton lands from which the federal government had ruthlessly evicted their Creek, Choctaw, Cherokee, and Seminole inhabitants. \u201cAn increasingly efficient market\u201d thus blindly and willfully created \u201ca nexus of cotton, slaves, and credit.\u201d And it was very much a capitalist nexus, as \u201censlaver-generals took land from Indians, enslaver-politicians convinced Congress to let slavery expand, and enslaver-entrepreneurs created new ways to finance and transport and commodify \u2018hands.\u2019\u201d Slavery\u2019s expansion was the driving force in U.S. history between the framing of the Constitution and the beginning of the Civil War,\u201d and in the process, it permanently (and unjustly) created wealth for whites and poverty for blacks. Peonage and convict leasing from 1865 to December 12, 1941 provided more \u201ccheap\u201d labor for the capitalist system. ",

            "answer_text": "Much more powerful. Slavery was a huge mistake in every sense of the word. Slave owners were as much a prisoner of the system as the slaves. They had so much invested in the slaves that switching to newer and better agricultural means was just not economical until they were destroyed. Without slaves there\u2019s no civil war. No tensions and riots. The US suffered extensive damage from the civil war and echoes from it still resonate today. If there was no slavery, then racism would have never been the problem it was. Hispanics did not suffer the kind of racism that was reserved for Blacks. The Jim Crow era never happens. Slaves worked primarily on big estates and in the transportation industry. They displaced native workers in much the same way illegals do today. As such the cheap labor, which wasn\u2019t actually all that cheap when you figured out the costs, hurt the US economy and produced at least one serious depression. Most of the great achievements of the US did not involve slaves at all, and those that did the slaves were a minor portion of the workforce used for raw labor rather than skilled labor. The railroads for example. Those were built by free men. The Eastern side mostly by Irish and Eastern European immigrants. The West mostly by Chinese and Irish immigrants. The ranches of the west were worked by free men not slaves. Though some of them were former slaves. The NE had almost no slaves, many Americans had never even seen a Black prior to the civil war. Without slaves the Southern agricultural economy would have grown slower and been less reliant on cotton. That\u2019s the only negative that\u2019d resulted if the US had never engaged in slavery. The benefits of having never engaged in it greatly outweigh the small agricultural gain. ",
