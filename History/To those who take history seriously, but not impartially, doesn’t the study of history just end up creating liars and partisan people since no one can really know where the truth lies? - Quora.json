            "answer_text": "Well, that\u2019s what you\u2019d think because you never really had a discussion of history. Take it to the most basic base, history is the study of past successes and mistakes to make sure the future is safe. This leads to investigating the past through records, monuments, relics and stuff to conclude a story in history and how it happened, how it ended. But, even if they were just theories based on what we see, know right now, everything that happened has to happened based on a basic and logical flow. That\u2019s why even if we don\u2019t know everything, we can be certain that some parts actually happened. And the one who lies about what happened in the past has to make up something that comform to all the certain parts we have and know of. You can always make up a story about uncertain parts, but the parts that are certain: you can not disprove them, no one believes you and bam, one liar is called out. So, in actuality, being a liar in history is harder than being a partially right in history. It\u2019s very much an investigation of crime. It might not be right to every details, but from the certain evidences, we can deduce who was the criminal. Thanks to that, lies and liars don\u2019t survive too long. It does give birth to the kind of sleeze bags who talk about selected certain parts of history to bend it over to suit their interest though. But then again, that\u2019s what they do everyday anyway. Edit: Feb 26, 2020I came back to make this edit for I have just seen the hash tag #ApolozieToVietNam and #KoreansApologizetoVietnam on Twitter. This is exactly what I mean by liars won\u2019t survive for long in history. The 20 Koreans (not really all 20 of them, I guess) not complying to the quarantine asked of them by Vietnamese government during the outbreak of coronavirus came back to Korea, lying to the media that Vietnam mistreated them. giving them only bread to eat for several hours. Not to be disrespectful, but Vietnamese \u201cb\u00e1nh m\u00ec\u201d is in the top 10 of most delicious street food, and the ones they were eating, according to what YTN (the channel broad casting the news) released, those are several times better than what you often get off the streets. And they complain about being fed once in some hours. Are they pigs or something to want food for less than that? lol The thing is, they came to Vietnam as tourists when their own country is the next biggest nest of infection of a dangerous disease, refusing to comply to quarantine, keeping up with complaints about being mistreated, lying about it back home. From what I have read, they deserve to be called as liars. This is exactly how history doesn\u2019t have a place for liars. Especially with how fast news travel today. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely not. A serious student of history will undertake research and try to access primary sources\u2026not just newspapers, for example, but the writings of people who were there at the time, who either worked to influence an outcome (pro or con) or were passive observers. Some of those people will have indicated through their commentary and or correspondence what they observed or other items they might have been dealing with. Possibly a greater weighting of contemporaneous commentary will be assigned to the primary actors, yet with the understanding that if you want to know about water, you don\u2019t ask a goldfish. Through this process, biases can often be discerned. And often those biases are simply those of the loudest yakker of the time. Additional research and readings will review any previous histories of the event that may exist or the time and may disclose popular misconceptions of what really occurred. All this information will be gathered together and compared with those existing histories and perhaps a new assessment of the time and event(s) in question may be obtained. Maybe not. A non-serious student of history will do the hard work of pointing their browser at Wikipedia, accept a single account of events located there as gospel truth, copy the text into their term paper, order a pizza, start up their favorite videogame or turn on the TeeVee, and leave the partially eaten pizza in its box on the kitchen table. An absolutely perfect example comes to mind, which is the story of the legendary baseball player Ty Cobb. Here was a guy who broke most of the records that were in existence at the time, some of which still stand. He retired holding more than 90 records. But he acquired through anecdote and especially the reporting of one particular newspaper reporter (who disliked him) a terrible reputation for spiking opposing players, getting into fights all the time, and for being an irascible racist who hated Blacks and who hated children. A Mr. Charles Leerhsen decided he would re-investigate the saga of Ty Cobb, and he discovered that Cobb loved to return the letters of his young fans and did so consistently; did several things that served to welcome Blacks into baseball, and was yes, an aggressive player but utterly unlike the societal ogre he had been made out to be. He published his findings in a book \u201cTy Cobb: A Terrible Beauty\u201d in 2016. He basically found out that Cobb was nothing like he had been portrayed for nearly 100 years, but instead, was the recipient of endless criticism and haranguing from this one sportswriter (whose name escapes me) and in no way deserved his awful reputation.
