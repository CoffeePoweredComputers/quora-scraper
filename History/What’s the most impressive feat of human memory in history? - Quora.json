            "answer_text": "Most might answer this question with a single feat of memory by an individual. However, the most impressive display of memory is oral tradition as a whole within human communities. There\u2019s a single story which has been proven to be passed along an Aborigine group in Australia for about 7,000 years. Now, that\u2019s a long memory. A team of university researchers in 2017 studied a story passed on by the Gugu Badhun Aboriginal people of Australia. It was a story that involved a volcano. That particular continent isn\u2019t known for its devastating eruptions, so it was strange that this story was told. It turns out there was a volcano that erupted in that region \u2014 7000 years ago. The Gugu Badhun story of this explosion has been passed down over 230 generations. This story is older than the pyramids and exists to this very day. Not even the power of a volcano could destroy it. What\u2019s more, Dr. Benjamin Cohen at the University of Glasgow has found evidence some of the aboriginal stories go back to 10,000 years. Now, that\u2019s staggering. \u201cThese stories are plausible descriptions of a volcanic eruption... The volcanic eruption of Kinrara adds to a growing list of geological events that appear to be recounted in Australian Aboriginal traditions, including sea level rise around 10,000 years ago and other volcanic eruptions elsewhere on the continent.\u201d \u2014 Doctor Benjamin Cohen, Phys.org website ",
