Once I heard that only Japanese (gayjin ) Jewish (gentiles) and Gypsies have a clear distinction between their race and the Rest of the World.   The divide is as strong as Black and Whites in the USA. The nieghbourhoods where they live: Las 3000 Viviendas - Seville  La Mina - Barcelona  El Ruedo - Madrid   The accent, the problematic integration\u2026 In the last 20 years Spain received inmigrants from Latin America, North Africa (Morocco mostly), Sub Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe, but they are just newcomers, and you spot them in the university classes and there\u2019s a lot of progress in one generation (around 10,7% is foreign and 14,36% is born abroad) In fact, 3.5% of the total graduated in 2016\u201317, but 5% were undergraduated in the next year (2017\u20132018).   There are almost not gypsies in the last years of high-school and they are quite rare in university, but it\u2019s slowly changing: S\u00f3lo un 2% de los gitanos llega a la universidad y el 80% son mujeres (changing for the better) They are a very sizable community (between half and one million), their history is complicated and goes back centuries. In the 1990s there were still many nomadic communities and other living in illegal slums built by themselves. To sum up: They are not foreign (entered the Iberian peninsula around 1425): Gitanos - WikipediaThey don\u2019t have a different languague (Cal\u00f3 is extinct), different religion (big part of them are Evangelical, but others are deeply Catholic: Hermandad de los Gitanos (Sevilla) - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libreThey are not assimilated, even though they are no longer nomadic, their music and culture is felt paramount to the idea of Hispanity: Flamenco - WikipediaCriminality, poverty, superstition and \u201cmachismo\u201d are part of the assimilation problem (and very well backed by statistics by the way):",

            "answer_text": "\u201cRace\u201d??? Spaniards, from Spain are mostly Europeans, because the country is part of the European continent. The main part of the Spanish ancestry is Celtic with some Greek and Phoenician. With a good amount of Basks that were the original Iberian population before the Celts. There were also an 8% of Jews from the times when the Romans destroyed the Temple in Jerusalem. During Roman times there were a certain amount of cultural mix all around Europe as the Romans didn\u2019t really care about such silly things as long as you were Roman Citizen. And this meant anybody from anywhere in the empire, from Britannia to Northern Africa, Hispania or modern day Afghanistan. When Rome fell, the Goths and Vandals invaded the peninsula. And in VIII Century the Arabs and Berber invaded the peninsula bringing (you got it) Arab, Berber and other African genes. Arabs, Jews and all Muslim converts, even those that were Christian for generations were exiled during the XVI Century from Spain and Portugal (the Portuguese Sephardi Jews settled here in Amsterdam) and we could thus say that this somewhat reduced the genetic pool of African origin. But at the same time came the Gypsies and while they stayed mostly segregated they did add some new blood to the mix. And then came a new invasion of Barbarians from beyond the border, armed with horribly camp shirts, sandals, white socks and suncreme came the Germans, Dutch, French, Belgian and British\u2026 add some Barry White to the mix and you get the picture. And on top of that came South Americans, East Europeans, North Africans and people from all over\u2026 And well, that\u2019s it. Thus, what race are they? I guess \u2026 human? ",
