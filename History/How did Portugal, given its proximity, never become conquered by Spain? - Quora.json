            "answer_text": "Portugal was an empire too, the whole of Portugal was larger than all of Europe. You see the small European piece of it, but Portugal was a global power. Despite that, Spain did conquer Portugal, kind of. I will give the whole story with other information to explain so it'll be long BACKGROUND The Spanish Crown had been marrying the Portuguese for generations and vice-versa, they were basically the same family and Portugal and Spain supported each other always. Queen Isabella, the wife of Charles I, was a Portuguese princess. She acted as the true queen of Spain while her husband was abroad fighting in Germany, Italy and France and she was actually remembered with love by Spaniards. Charles I of Spain (and V of the HREmpire)On horse   Older Charles  Isabella, princess of Portugal and queen of Spain Their son prince Phillip grew up with his mother in Valladolid, in fact, he had a far more distant relationship with his absent father than the close relationship Phillip had with his mother. But Isabella died young, when Phillip was barely a young teen. And Phillip went out of control in his teenage years, his father made him marry the Portuguese princess Maria when he was 16 to stop his behaviour. But she died when he was 20, and then he married Mary of England at age 25, who died soon too because she was much older than him. Phillip had affairs with women all his life from very young to old, inside and outside marriage because his several wives died all. Isabella De Osorio was his most famous affair, which lasted all his life regardless of his wife. Phillip II, of Spain, Portugal and EnglandIn his armour, wearing the red and golden Golden Fleece pendant of the Spanish and Austrian Crowns  As king of England  As prince of Spain  Older Protrait   Anyway with this background you will undertand it. Charles married a Portuguese princess and their son Phillip married another Portuguese princess. Meanwhile in Portugal the prince Sebasti\u00e3o inherited the throne. Sebasti\u00e3o I of Portugal Sebasti\u00e3o was merely a teenager and he was very likely homosexual. That is because he refused to marry or have any intimate interaction with women (which many said was because he had a disease) but the truth is he had very close and known homosexual friends around him with whom he had far more intimate interactions than with women. Whatever the reason, his mother failed to convince him to marry the Spanish princess Isabella (the daughter of Phillip II). This was a problem, without marrying, producing an heir was next to impossible. As a prince he saw the Ottomans rise in the Mediterranean and Spain taking the leading role to keep the Catholic dominion over the Mediterranean sea. He wanted Portugal to play her part in the conflict and he decided to launch an invasion on Morocco (which was Portugal's to take according to the Treaty of Tordesillas signed with Spain), and for which he asked his uncle Phillip II for Spanish support. Phillip had just defeated the Berbers and the Turks, and was trying to reach peace with them so he tried to convince his nephew to change his mind. Sebasti\u00e3o was convinced and refused to call off the invasion of Morocco, so Phillip gave him Spanish support. The Pope was favourable to Spain and Spain had just succeeded against the Muslims, so the Pope showed support and called for Catholics to join Portugal. Sebasti\u00e3o was very young and naive and he decided to fight himself against the Moroccans\u2026 the Moroccans were more than ready for Portugal and they defeated them, Sebasti\u00e3o died in the front, without a son. His uncle Henrique who was a cardinal, was the only choice to replace him. But he was a cardinal, he hadn't had any sons because he couldn\u2019t, and he was an old man already. Phillip didn't feel the same sympathy for Henrique as for his nephew and he was smart enough to see what was going to happen. Henrique asked for permission to renounce his vows and produce a son. But Phillip used Spain's close relationship with Rome and the Pope declined the request forcing him to remain without heir as Phillip wanted. Henrique died. Phillip, son of a Portuguese princess and former husband of another one, reclaimed Portugal for himself as he had been expecting since his nephew\u2019s death. But the Portuguese were always wary of the Spanish, their identity is partly built on that feeling\u2026 so another candidate, Ant\u00f3nio, reclaimed the throne for himself and he counted with the support of a large part of the Portuguese. The conflict erupted and war between Ant\u00f3nio and Phillip II started, only that Phillip had the Spanish Empire and Ant\u00f4nio had a large Portuguese support base. The sounding victory of the Spanish in the battle of Alc\u00e1ntara under the command of the 3rd Duke of Alba, forced them to escape from mainland Portugal. The Spanish Navy led by \u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n chased them out and finished them in Terceira, securing the Portuguese throne for Phillip II. Portugal was conquered or not, depending on whether you consider Ant\u00f3nio the legitimate Portuguese heir, you think Phillip was just defending his better claim. But anyway Spain made her king's claim prevail by force. IBERIAN UNION The Iberian Union started, although knowing the Portuguese feeling, Phillip left Portugal largely independent within the Union, barely merging the navy with Spain and some other minor aspects. But Spain was the superpower of the time, so it had a LOT of haters. Portugal had enjoyed the advantages of a lower profile on the global stage and becoming the target of the Dutch, British and French next to Spain was a big inconvenience for the Portuguese. The Dutch attacked Brazil when Portugal joined Spain, English privateers started looting Portuguese cargos as well\u2026 the Portuguese suffered all the problems of being Spain by inheriting Spain's enemies. Things kept getting uglier between Spain and Portugal as time passed and external conflict turned into internal preasure between both empires, re-enforcing an anti-Spanish sentiment in Portugal. But going back to the Spanish royal family, it gets really tricky. Phillip II had a son, prince Charles. But like with Phillip, his mother died and his father was very busy ruling the Spanish Empire. Charles I was a busy father, but Phillip II had his mother; Phillip himself was just as much a busy father as his own, and in this case prince Charles did not have a mother. This is important because prince Charles had a terrible relationship with his father, Phillip actually tried to approach his son many times but it was impossible. Charles even threatened his father with leaving Spain and joining the Dutch rebels against his father! He tried to kill the Duke of Alba too. Phillip had spies watching his son, and he ultimately had to lock him up more than once as he tried to escape Madrid. He fell from the stairs and almost dies and Phillip went to see him as soons as possible. But his behaviour was out of control and Phillip had to lock him up in the town of Ar\u00e9valo. This was a big family drama. Prince Don Charles of Spain, 1st son of Phillip II (Don is an honorific title in Spanish)As a kid  As a teenager  Adding to this, Phillip had a problem with his secretary of state Antonio P\u00e9rez. Phillip had a bastard brother, Juan, who he treated as his \u201creal\u201d brother. Antonio P\u00e9rez, wanted more power and he tried to turn Phillip against his brother. But Juan sent his own secretary, Escobedo, to explain everything to Phillip. P\u00e9rez feared that was his end, so he convinced Phillip that Escobedo wanted to kill him because his brother wanted the throne. So he asked for permission to kill Escobedo and Phillip after some time agreed. He killed him, but soon Juan died too and Phillip read his brother's letters, he discovered the lies of P\u00e9rez, but he couldn't imprison him because he had agreed to kill Escobedo and he felt guilty and very ashamed that this would come out. P\u00e9rez was replaced as secretary and banned from leaving Madrid. The most powerful noble family in Spain was the house of Alba, but there were other powerful families such as \u00c9boli or Mendoza, with the famous powerful Cardinal Mendoza. The closest man to Phillip II in government affairs was initially Ruy G\u00f3mez of \u00c9boli, and Ana de Mendoza married him. The Duke of Alba remained the most trusted man of Phillip personally and in war. But Ruy G\u00f3mez died, and his widow the princess of \u00c9boli was an ambitious pretty woman that knew how to use it. She most likely became another lover of Phillip II, and when Phillip replaced her husband after dead with Antonio P\u00e9rez, she became the lover of P\u00e9rez. She took part in all of P\u00e9rez' lies and intrigues and she became a famous woman in Spain for her reckless attitude even fighting the Inquisition. Phillip did not imprison P\u00e9rez but he did imprison \u00c9boli. Princess of \u00c9boli, born Mendoza, ambitious lover of the court and nightmare of the Church. Anyway Antonio P\u00e9rez was Aragonese and the nobles of Arag\u00f3n had some privileges such as a separate justice. So he fled to Zaragoza seeking the protection of the Aragonese justice, trying to gain time to escape Spain. Phillip found a way to dodge the Aragonese privileges, the Inquisition was common to all of Spain, so he made a case against him to the Inquisition. The Aragonese nobles who were priding themselves in stopping the almighty king didn't like that move undermining their power\u2026 so they revolted. Phillip replied sending the army and executing all them, ending the Aragonese justice by a decree in the process xD Don Antonio P\u00e9rez, secretary of state of Phillip II  But P\u00e9rez escaped Spain and went to France and Britain. They were enemies of Spain and this man was close to the Spanish messed up royal family, can you guess what happened? He twisted the family drama and fabricated propaganda against Phillip as revenge. The enemies of Spain were very glad to spread the fake news about his Catholic Majesty as a vile man who imprisons his poor son or the evil Inquisition that did SO many bad things to him. This also reached and created the bad image of the royal court in Madrid that the Portuguese had. Queen Elizabeth hired this man to pass information to the English navy about Spain's military plans which they used to attack C\u00e1diz or Portugal. To top it all, prince Charles had gone completely mad and refused to eat in order to kill himself. He died of self-imposed starvation even with Phillip making people force him to eat. Spain lost its prince. So the 2nd in line, the younger brother also named Phillip became the new heir to the throne. Phillip didn't hate his father, he had learnt to live without him, a party life. After all, he was the younger, no plan for him\u2026 until then. Prince Phillip posed another different problem from his older brother, Phillip simply didn't want to be king. But the time came and king Phillip II died, so he became Phillip III of Spain and Portugal. Phillip III of Spain and Portugal, 2nd son of Phillip IIOn horse (painted by Diego de Vel\u00e1zquez)  As commander of the army  Just made king of Spain  He signed peace with England right away and dedicated his reign to enjoying himself, he used the institution of the valido, as a noble who would rule instead of the king. His valido was the Duke of Lerma who tried to move the capital back to Valladolid where he had more power and the king accepted. Madrid's well-established court under Phillip II forced the crown back soon afterward. In short, we had a useless king and a corrupt valido. The Portuguese didn't like it, no one did actually, in Madrid they hated it too. Phillip III had another son named Phillip, future Phillip IV of Spain and Portugal, he was less careless than his father but he still kept using his father's intitution of a valido. His was the famous Count-Duke of Olivares Count Duke of Olivares painted also by Diego de Vel\u00e1zquez (who was the artist of the Spanish Crown during the Golden Age of Spanish art and literature) Phillip IV of Spain and PortugalOn horse  Portrait  Diego de Vel\u00e1zquez, artist of the Spanish Crown, best Baroque artist and best artist of the Spanish Golden Age During all this time the wealthy and densely populated Castile had become poorer and increasingly uninhabited because it held the weight and cost of the empire almost single-handedly. Olivares was a smart man and acknowledged this trend, a trend that is obvious from today's perspective. He, like the so called novatores (educated commoners who proposed reforms to modernise Spain amidst the lack of care of the rulers) suggested creating a permanent army with men from all regions, a state bank to fund the crown without need of borrowing from foreign lenders as it had happened and had caused several bankruptcies, and other measures of the sort which aimed to modernise Spain after 2 kings falling behind. Becoming an absolutist monarchy more similar to France. But this required money and men from nobles in ALL regions. This meant that every single noble everywhere hated Olivares and they used his idea of recruiting more men from outside Castile as a way to turn people in other regions against him. And then he made his biggest mistake which was wanting to alter Portugal's status, as he saw Portugal becoming closer to Spain over time. The Portuguese had had enough between Phillip III, his valido and now this man, and they revolted. END OF THE UNION France attacked Spain taking advantage of the situation. They smartly attacked Catalonia, a region which contributed with less men to the army. Catalans angered with the Count Duke's idea of contributing more men to lift some weight from Castile (like other regions were), refused to give their share of the men to defend Catalonia. And Olivares had to hire mercenaries. Catalans refused to give a place to sleep to the men, and the mercenaries and later the other men too, reacted. They reacted by burning, raping and killing those who refused to give them a place to sleep (bear in mind this was not strange among soldiers back then to go wild before dying, specially if the locals refused to help them). The local authorities of Catalonia received a letter from Olivares demanding that they solved the situation, and they tried to enforce that Catalans gave a place to stay to the men. The armies had to be divided between Catalonia and Portugal, and they were focused on Catalonia as Portugal seemed easier to gain back than if France conquered Catalonia. Later this caused Catalans to revolt against the local authorities and eventually to join France, 12 years later Catalan authorities supported rejoining Spain anyway, very unhappy with the French treatment. But the Portuguese empire remained separate with a strong anti-Spanish sentiment that has somewhat worn off over the centuries, until today. Portugal remained an ally of Britain and hostile to Spain throughout history until the 20th century when relations between the 2 countries improved fast with many Portuguese presidents supporting close relations with Spain. There were exceptions though, during Napoleon's invasion Portugal and Spain were united by a common enemy, and Franco and Salazar were fairly close to each other as well. ",

            "answer_text": "The answers here (up to the moment) where so good that I was obliged to upvote them all. Fair warning: I\u2019m a Portuguese (check my bias). Apart from the excellent reasons (political and economic) already given, I just want to point out a few additional things. Pre-gunpowder Iberia 1) Portugal is mostly a very hilly, relatively barren terrain (not a very attractive country to conquer). 2) Portuguese military were very adept of \u201crazia\u201d (horseback guerrilla - there are really no good one-word translations), something that was learned from the moors and perfected to a \u201cT\u201d. Also we learned the art of the longbow (with early training) from the English and perfected the usage of the crossbow by isolated villagers - no invading column were \u201csafe\u201d in Portuguese lands. 3) Old people, women - even children - were indoctrinated into peaceful resistance (centuries before Mahatma Gandhi). Even today, it is a cultural feature that we don\u2019t work for people we don\u2019t like. Just as fish don\u2019t notice there is such a thing as water, most Portuguese live their full lives unaware of a  cultural trait they carry. 4) Always at numerical disadvantage, Portuguese usage of terrain (and night) to their advantage became an art form. We could inundate vast plains, we could retreat to the mountains and stage ambushes over the entry passes into the country. In a pinch, Portuguese  soldiers could disguise themselves or \u201cvanish\u201d quite well into the landscape - as civilians or even trees - and carry on, practicing irregular and asymmetrical warfare (in small groups), and so on. 5) Having to maintain a permanent war against the Moors for centuries - a society that could dispose of 3/4 of its young males as munitions (the richer 1/4 could - and did - corral 4 females each) - prompted Iberian Christian societies (both Portugal and Spain - and Spaniards aren\u2019t pushovers either) to change their demographics to survive: non first born (non inheriting) males, were mostly sent to the Monastic Orders - fierce fighters whose only chance of advancement was to distinguish themselves in battle. During the Age of Discoveries 1) Most wealth came from abroad. 2) Both Spain and Portugal were far more concerned with surveying the seven seas, closing rich trade deals and defending their overseas possessions than warring each other. Modern Era That didn\u2019t stop Spain to send its proxies (from the Low Countries) to try to invade either Brazil or Angola. Here they were really at a numerical disadvantage and invariably were unsuccessful. Navy groups build on the other side of \u201cthe pond\u201d (this nickname for the Atlantic Ocean was, secondly, Portuguese - \u201co nosso laguinho\u201d, an echo of the Roman \u201cMare Nostrum\u201d) always came to the rescue. When Napoleon decreed the Continental Blockade (and betrayed and invaded Spain) we didn\u2019t obliged - opened our ports in South America and Africa to our allies - and took our lumps\u2026 Napoleon tried to invade Continental Portugal. Several times. England came to help with Wellington. Tens of thousands died defending - not a King that fled to Brazil - but our nation and our land. Indeed, but also to defend Brazil from French Invasion (Portugal and Brazil were the same country, then). For that, Brazilian gold was used to repay England (gold that, later on, ended up financing England's Industrialization, and ultimately defining the American matrix). Apparently, Brazilians are only told of half of this story (which make us cringe - for their lack of memory) that we took their gold away. But Portugal never was an English underling. Example: Portugal was one of the first powers of its day to recognize the independence - from England itself - of the 13 colonies on the eastern seaboard as the newly formed United States. It was the right thing to do at the time - and in our interests, of course (a stronger America would redefine us near the center of the world). Today Presently, the world has changed a lot. Spain and Portugal started as weak nations abandoned by the Roman Empire into disorder and chaos (and the middle ages) on the periphery of the [then] known world.. With the centuries of Oceanic Discoveries both Spain and Portugal \u201crepositioned\u201d themselves in the center of the Modern World. Nowadays we are so near that we see ourselves as brothers (and I speak for myself, every time I travel thru Spain) and we feel at home in each other countries (both the Portuguese and Spanish Languages are so close, we understand each other quite well). Also Spain and Portugal share basically the same [political and economic] interests. A \u201c21st-century Iberian Union\u201d would make sense indeed. Then again all of the (previously competing) Western Europe Countries (England, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and so on) are like-minded friends, sharing similar interests, and belonging together in several \u201cclubs\u201d such as the EU, Schengen Area, NATO, etc. This might be new to others, but Spaniards and Portuguese take the long view and usually think in centuries, not years\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Ever thought of the opposite? Portugal conquering Spain? It happened on the 5th of June 1706, when a mostly Portuguese army led by the Marques das Minas, conquered Spain\u2019s capital city, Madrid, and crowned Charles III King of Spain. This happened in the context of the war of Spanish Succession, in the early 18th century. \u2018Spain\u2019 is an incredibly modern construct - only after the War of Spanish Succession was Spain truly unified under one rule, one Monarch. Until then, there were several Iberian powers, which had emerged from the Reconquista, fighting for political control of the Peninsula - Portugal and Castille being the most prominent, but , for instance, Navarre and Aragon being also important players , sometimes assuring, sometimes disturbing the balance of power in the region. This struggle for Iberian supremacy lasted for many centuries, and involved many battles, many wars, and many royal weddings. It ended with the grand unification of most of the Iberian Peninsula under \u2018Spain\u2019, whilst the rest, which was controlled by the Portuguese Crown, became modern-day Portugal, and a tip (Gibraltar) which is, to this day, British. Most of the times, Iberian skirmishes involved the two most prominent powers, Portugal and Castille. The Portuguese defeated the Castillians in the Battle of Aljubarrota in 1385. Later, in the 15th century, as a consequence of the overall War of Castillian succession, in which the Portuguese king of the time got involved, the Battle of Toro was fought. Although the battle most likely ended in a stalemate, the Castillian-Aragonese allies reclaimed victory, leading to the marriage between Queen Isabella of Castille, and King Ferdinand of Aragon, famously known as the Catholic Kings. This event marked the foundation of modern day Spain. There were several peace treaties that followed, like for instance the Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas, but this treaty was extremely unfavourable to the Castillians, and was several times renegotiated. Later, in 1498, the two crowns divided the World in the Treaty of Tordesilhas, the consequences of which are still visible in a world map to this day. With the early death of King Sebastian I of Portugal in the Battle of Alcazar, in 1578, a Succession crisis ensued, leading to the coronation of King Phillip II of Spain, as King Phillip I of Portugal in 1580. Whether it can be said that Spain invaded Portugal is contested to this day, since Phillip I was the son of Charles V and Isabella of Portugal, and therefore, King Sebastian\u2019s uncle, and thus had, very likely, the most legitimate claim to the throne of Portugal. In fact, Phillip I was formally recognised as King of Portugal in the cortes de Tomar of 1581. Also, it should be noted that the new King's election was carried on condition that the kingdom and its overseas territories should remain separate from Spain and keep their own laws and Cortes. This led to the Iberian Union, in which Spain and Portugal would remain united in a personal union of the crowns (remaining formally independent and with autonomous administrations) for the next 60 years. In 1640 after a swift revolution that happened in Lisbon, John, duke of Braganza was acclamed as John IV, King of Portugal, establishing the powerful House of Braganza as the new ruling dinasty of Portugal. The war between the two countries lasted from 1640 until 1668. The two decisive battles of Castelo Rodrigo and Montes Claros, ended with Portuguese victories. These definitely secured Portuguese independence, and led to the Treaty of Lisbon in 1668, in which Spain formally recognised the House of Braganza as the ruling House of Portugal. After an initial period of peace, Portugal saw itself involved in the War of Spanish Succession, and although King Pedro II initially sided with the Bourbon faction, it later changed sides to better reflect Portuguese interests (mostly, Atlantic trade), and joined the war. It was during this period that the Marques das Minas conquered Madrid in 1706, as mentioned before. In the 19th century, as Portugal refused to join Napoleon\u2019s Continental Blockade against the British, Napoleon had Spain invaded, and placed his cousin on the Throne, whilst attempting to invade Portugal several times. An Anglo-Portuguese army later defeated Napoleon\u2019s army and liberated both Spain and Portugal from French rule. After that there were little to no attempts at either country wanting to go to war with the other. Today both countries enjoy an excellent relationship, and are partners not only within the framework of the European Union, but also through countless bilateral agreements. So to make a long story short, the question is perhaps oversimplified. One should take into account the historical context in which both countries were created, and developed, and how events played out throughout the many centuries of their existence, in order to understand the intricate, sometimes friendly, sometimes even hostile relations between Portugal and the rest of Spain.

            "answer_text": "Please note that I'm basing this in my previous answer to a similar question: Why weren't Spain and Portugal united in a similar way to Aragon and Castille?  First, why should it have been conquered by Spain? - The same could be applied to all neighbouring countries in the world, \"How did xxxx, given its proximity, never become conquered by yyy?\".  OK. Being honest I could also answer that it was tried at some moments... but never successfully. Let's have a quick overview: Spain and Portugal took separate paths in history a loooong time ago: In 1139 Afonso Henriques seceded his then \"County\" from the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, becoming the first King of Portugal (Afonso I). That \"independence\" was recognized in 1143 by the Pope (Papal recognition was considered very relevant in those times!!) and by the King of Le\u00f3n (Treaty of Zamora).During some periods the neighbouring Kingdom of Castile wasn't too happy with Portugal's independence, and on several occasions attempted to \"control it\", often trying to take advantage of, or in relation with, dynastic or succession problems (that were common in those times). But with no success. A significant event during this period is the Portuguese victory over Castille at Aljubarrota (1385)After 1580, and again as a consequence of dynastic problems, Portugal and Spain were ruled by the same Kings... of Spain (Philip II + two others). This period is known as the \"Iberian Union\". But even then they still were different kingdoms (... yes, with a common King).... But this \"Union\" was unsatisfactory to most Portuguese people, and unilaterally put to an end in 1640 when the Duke of Braganza was acclaimed as King Jo\u00e3o IV of Portugal by Portuguese nobility.That started a war with Spain (Known in Portugal as the Guerra da Restaura\u00e7\u00e3o, Portuguese Restoration War), that ended in 1668 when the King of Spain signed the \"Treaty of Lisbon\", fully recognising Portugal's independence. Please note that this conflict must be understood in the wider context of the pan-european Thirty-years war, and had complex international implications: Portugal has always been a British ally, Spain was at that moment an ally of France.After that there were more wars between the two countries in the 18th century, some of them even based mostly in South America (Spanish\u2013Portuguese War (1735\u201337)). One of them, in 1762-1763, is often known as the \"Fantastic War\" - as there were no battles: it was also part of an pan-European conflict, in this case of the Seven Years' WarIn short: Spain has tried - and never succeeded (... hard guys, these neighbours!!). AND many of the more recent wars between the two countries have just been part of different alignments in pan-european conflicts.... where, apparently, none of the two countries was really interested in directly fighting with the other :-). Both Spain and Portugal have a rich, complex and interesting history - and share rich, complex and interesting parts of it. Oh, and many of us wouldn't mind to have some sort of \"21st-century Iberian Union\". As I see it, a closer relation between Spain and Portugal would be good for both. It is an admirable country, and they are great people :). ",

Probably, the last goth king died in Portugal (Viseu) during the muslim invasion.Portugal was one of the kingdom formed during the Reconquest, with Navarra, Leon, Aragon and Castile.All the Christians Kingdoms have several wars, the main victory of Portugal over Castile was, probably, the Battle of Aljubarrota.During the War of Castile Succesion (1475\u20131479), Portugal supported Joanna la Beltraneja (wife of King Alfonso V of Portugal) and Aragon supported Isabella of Castile (wife of Ferdinand, the future King Ferdinand II of Aragon) This war is the key, if Joanna had won Portugal and Castile were joinned and Aragon could remain as an independent country (with Sardinia, Sicily and Naples\u2026 interesting).Philip II of Spain was proclaimed King of Portugal in 1581, after the death of Anthony I of Portugal (He was a Cardinal and had no kids) Philip was the heir to the trone by grandson of Manuel I of Portugal (but Duke of Alba had to enter in Lisbon to substantiate it). Most of people in Spain considered the Visigoth Hispania, before muslim invation, was re-establishedPortugal obtain again the independence in 1640, after the Restoration War.Last war between Spain and Portugal was in 1801, and Spain occupied the city of Olivenza and border territories. Portugal claimmed the restitution in the Congress of Vienna (1815) and after WWI (Spain was neutral country). Olivenza is today a spanish town.Both First (1873\u201374) and Second (1931\u201339) Spanish Republics had plans to invade Portugal, even the First Spanish Republic designed a Federal Constitution to include Portugal; the Second Spanish Republic designed and started the (failed) Plan P to invade Portugal during the Spanish Civil War.During 1931 the catalonian secessionist leader Francesc Macia proclaimed the Republic of Catalonia into the Federation of Iberian Republics. A study made by University of Salamanca and Centre for Research and Studies in Sociology - Lisbon in 2011 shows that 39.8 % of spaniards and 46.1 % of portugueses agree with an Iberian Union, curiosly this idea is stronger in Catalonia, left parties in Portugal and anarcho-communism parties in Spain.Yes, I\u2019m Spanish and I think both countries are fine as they are today, I like Portugal, in fact I often spend my holidays in Portugal.",

            "answer_text": "Hello! Well, first of all,Portugal is as notorious (or even more) as Spain for its conquests across the globe. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal and Spain discovered A great part of Africa, Asia, and America. By the Tordesillas Treaty(1494), the two centuries divided among them the already discovered lands and decided that on the left of an imaginary land, next dicoveries would be Portuguese and on the right of that line they would be for Spain. Secondly, Spain, as we know it is a much more recent country than Portugal. When we say \u201cSpain\u201d we think of several countries that were called Castilla, L\u00e9on, Arag\u00f3n, and so on. On the contrary, Portugal is a unified country with the most ancient European borders. Our continental borders were fixed since 1297. So, the two countries have subsisted as independents since they were formed, with the exception of the period between 1580 and 1640, when the Spanish kings were also recognizesd as Portuguese kings. That became possible because the Portuguese king Sebasti\u00e3o died in battle, without having sons. The next in the family tree was the King Philip the second of Spain, through his wife. Therefore, he became Philip the first of Portugal. But even during that period, there was not a fusion between the two countries. Portugal was always considered as an autonomous country, with its own laws and way of life. There were 3 Spanish kings ruling over Portugal but the third one began to disrespect the autonomy of Portugal and to appoint for high government charges incompetent people. Portugal also suffered with the wars that Spain led against its own ennemies. So, in 1640, people made a revolution and raise to the throne the head of Bragan\u00e7a House, who became king John the fourth and broke free of Spaniish rule. Portuguese and Spanish people love each other, they share a splendid relationship, but they are different in several aspects and both are proud and fierce about their independence. ",

            "answer_text": "I have given this answer to a similar question: In just a few words because of the Portuguese maritime expansion! Portugal started as part of the spanish kingdom of Leon and became self ruled in the XII century (1143 by the treaty of Zamora between Afonso Henriques, the first portuguese King and Afonso VII Emperor Hispaneae, who recognized portuguese independence but held the portuguese monarch as a vassal or 1179 when the Pope Alexander III formally recognized Portugal and took it as a vassal). It could have just been one of those fleeting spanish kingdoms that existed between the X and the XVI century, in fact in 1383, when king Fernando I died, we almost became united to Castilla, as the King married his only daughter to King John I of Castilla and their heir was supposed to have united the two crowns. However the queen mother who stood as regent was quite unpopular and the Bastard son of a previous king, Master of the Order of Avis staged a coup with the backing of the arraia miuda (the people, in particular the merchants of the big towns, Lisbon and Porto) and the Castillians were defeated in several battles, putting an end to the attempted union. The next opportunity was at the death of Henry the IV of Castilla, when the Portuguese king Afonso V claimed the throne, but Isabel married her cousin Fernando of Aragon and together they defeated the portuguese at the battle of Toro, ending a chance of an union headed by Portugal. Afonso V was the last portuguese feudal monarch. In 1480 the Prince Perfect John II became King of Portugal and not only accelerated portuguese maritime expansion, with the goal of reaching India, but he created the modern state by subduing part of the aristocracy (phisically eliminating some of the most high ranking noblemen) and centralizing power with the revenue of the gold from the coast of Guinea (Mina), making Portugal the first modern European nation state. Based on his vision and that of his successor Manuel I, Portugal became a global power and the deeds were celebrated in an epic poem by the poet Cam\u00f5es, who both helped establish the portuguese language and created an idea of Portugal that the portuguese would rally around during the dark times of spanish rule (while others have noted that the kingdom of Portugal remained separated, Portugal was forced into disastrous wars with many of Spain\u2019s enemies, in who were our main customers and traditional allies and since portuguese colonies were not a priority many territories were lost essentially to the Dutch, and while many portuguese gladly supported the union, in particular the nobility, Portugal was under occupation, a spanish garrison was kept in Lisbon a spanish governor resided in Lisbon and political prisoners filled the jails). In the reign of Filipe IV (Filipe III in Portugal) attempts were made to centralize power, a moved that if accomplished would have resulted in the complete loss of a separate identity, and that the Portuguese, who by then had a fully separated identity, raised in the epic deeds of their predecessors and having the self esteem of having build a large empire, defeating great powers all over the world could not stomach, so they killed the main arm of the spanish rule, the secretary of state and imprisoned the spanish governoress and proclaimed independence. Of all the vast portuguese overseas posessions only Ceuta did not welcome independence and the new regime and chose to stay under Spain. The war of independence would last 28 years, at a huge cost, as we simultaneously fought a war with the United Provinces for control of Brasil and to defend other Portuguese domains in Africa and Asia. So as I mentioned at the beginning Portugal could have become part of Spain at any time in our history but because of the self worth brought about by the Portuguese Discoveries and the creation of a large empire, by 1580 it was too late to integrate Portugal into Spain, as we had different interests and our separate history prevented Portuguese submission to Spanish rule.

            "answer_text": "Curiously, the time of the Catholic Monarchs, who faced off with the Portuguese at least twice (the War of Castilian Succession, and the events that led to the Treaty of Tordesillas) was the moment in which the unification of the entire Peninsula under one crown became not only most likely, but perhaps even desired. The War of Castilian Succession saw Castile divided in two, with one side supporting Isabel de Trast\u00e1mara, daughter of King Enrique IV, and the other supporting Enrique's supposed daughter Juana \"La Beltraneja\" (so called because it was suspected her biological dad was actually Beltr\u00e1n de la Cueva, the King's favourite). Arag\u00f3n joined Isabel's side, and Portugal and France joined Juana's side. Isabel won, and the Treaty of Alca\u00e7ovas was signed between Castile and Portugal. One of the terms of said treaty was that Isabel, the eldest daughter of Fernando and Isabel, was to marry Prince John's (future John II of Portugal) son and heir, Afonso. Years later, Isabel and Afonso got married and actually fell in love almost instantly. Meanwhile, the Catholic Monarchs' heir, Juan, was an ill child that was many times at the edge of death, and Isabel and Fernando were worried that, if Juan died, their throne would end up in the hands of Afonso and Isabel, which would probably mean greater influence of Portugal in Castile, something they had fought for so long to avoid. Afonso died in strange circumstances, with some blaming the Monarchs for arranging the then heir's death. The second possibility was when Isabel got married to John II's cousin, Manuel I of Portugal (despite her wishes to become a nun after her first husband's death). She got pregnant and died giving birth to a child that was called Miguel da Paz. Miguel fell under the care of his maternal grandparents, Isabel and Fernando, and plans were made to groom him to become the future King of Aragon, Castile and Portugal, with a greater influence from the Castilian side. Unfortunately, Miguel died at age 2. The next chance was with the Habsburg kings, from Philip II to Philip IV. The former had inherited the crown through his mother, Isabel of Portugal, after the last of the Avis monarchs, Henrique, died without issue (he was a cardinal, and was not allowed to drop his vows to have a heir), and Philip II had the biggest claim to the crown. Of course, the Habsburg squanderd the chance to fully unite the Iberian Peninsula (see, they were quite jerkasses towards the Portuguese) and they separated again in 1640. Finally, the last chance is one that barely had a chance (heh) of happening. When Isabel II of Spain was forced to abdicate in 1868, there were several candidates to the crown. One of them was the former King Consort of Portugal, Fernando II, who renounced to the crown because he did not want to be again part of the political life. And another was Leopold zu Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, who was married to the Infanta Ant\u00f3nia, sister of the then King of Portugal, Luis I. With the proper series of coincidences (pretty much meaning that Lu\u00eds I and his descendants had to die), Leopold could have found himself King of Spain and King Consort of Portugal, leading to a potential unification of the two countries.

            "answer_text": "The answer to this question lies in a series of inter-dynastic marriages between the Houses of Aviz (of Burgundian/Alfonsine Portugese royalty) and Trastamara (royalty of Castille/Aragon/Leon) and a rather singular conflict which changed the course of Iberian colonialism and inter-nation relations for years to come. It was a very important time for the Iberian Peninsula, when the the collection of individual Kingdoms we know as \"Spain\" was coming together, and the last War of the  Reconquista (or the driving out of the moors was about to happen) under the Catholic Monarchs. The Spanish and Portuguese royalty extensively intermarried. as such there were always competing claims from either household for the several crowns of Kingdoms in Portugal or Castille or Aragon or Galicia or Leon and so forth. The same was the case with the War of the Castilian Succession which precedes the War of the Portuguese Succession User-10333582167263462789 mentions. Please refer wiki for the relations among the claimants to the throne of Castille and how the battle played out. However, the War of the Castillian Succession is important to us because it gave rise to the Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas, a gamechanger in the power-politics of Europe. The War was fought both on land and sea, resulting in a Castillian victory on land and a Portuguese victory at sea.  The Treaty for the first time ever, delineated the spheres of influence of colonial powers clearly, and Portugal scored a major victory here in terms of negotiation. It retained a virtual hegemony over all territories discovered and to be discovered between Canary Islands (which alone Castille could retain) and Guinea (which Portugal retained). This was also a landmark treaty for it marks the first time European powers \"shared\" colonies amongst themselves, a model which would be followed for several centuries to come. Arguably although this set the stage for Treaty of Tordesillas, but nevertheless aided by the \"insurance\" of inter-dynastic marriage, Papal Bulls confirming \"colonial sharing\" treaties, strategic alliances etc., each was left more or less alone especially post Iberian Union times (which User-10333582167263462789 mentions) to build Empires. And the Empires became reinforcing deterrent engines of cementing their strategic independence, as there were several theatres of war, greater money involved, higher losses etc. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Portugal was conquered by Spain. It happened in 1580, with the Habsburg king of Spains (yes, plural, there were several Spanish kingdoms) became king of Portugal after the previous king had beeen killed in battle in North Africa. Portugal was a junior partner to the Spanish kingdom of Castille from 1580 to 1640. In 1640, the Habsburgs were waging war alongside their allies against an alliance led by France. The king of Spains demanded more and more money, troops and efforts from his Portuguese subjects, who ended up revolting against him. Normally, Spains would have forced Portugal into submission but they were in the middle of a war so it simply did not have the necessary ressources. By 1659, Spain had lost the war to France and part of the deal was that Portugal would remain independent (as it would weaken Spain). Spain then fought other wars against France until the end of the century and basically lost them all. The Spanish Succession war at the beginning of the 18th century was a bloody, protracted conflict wich ended up with France imposing a French king on the throne of Spain. Overall, France had turned Spain from enemy to ally BUT it had to make concessions - one of those was Spain giving up on some territories. Taking Portugal was out of the equation. During the 18th century, Spain attacking Portugal would have been considered as France starting a was to turn a potential enemy (Portugal) into a vassal state or to make it part of its Spanish ally. This would not have been allowed. And Spain had far more interesting territories to conquer: colonies and Italian territories. Indeed Spain found it hard to retain these territories (the Austrian Habsburgs and Italian princes wanted them too). As of the end of the Napoleonic wars, Spain had become quite weak and Portugal could have been quite hard to control because the Portuguese had a strong national identity. As of the end of the Napoleonic wars, simple annexions in the old way had become harder and harder to keep because the people simply did not accept being robbed of their national rulers. Also, the UK wanted Portugal to remain independent. ",

            "answer_text": "Come on, haven\u2019t you bothered to look into the basics ? Spain (and its predecessors, Leon, Castille) have been at war with Portugal since the 12th century. And these wars meant invasions. Some were more succesful than others but, in most instances, Portugal managed to repel these invasions. And even in the 20th century there were two occasions when Spain did consider invading Portugal. The first one, was during World War II, Hitler and Franco met and the issue was discussed, It did not go forward probably because Franco asked for too much aid and Hitler was busy in other parts. The second one was after the Carnation Revolution, in 1974. Franco was very worried about the left-wing movements in Portugal, specially the Communist party, and started contingency plans to invade, but apparently the Americans did not give the green light. So yes, Spain invaded Portugal multiple times. And Portugal also invaded Spain. But basically the land border has been stable since the 13th century. It is the most stable land border in the world.

Portugal was one of the main trade/mercantile empires, the true first world war happened in the XVI Century between the Portuguese and the Dutch (1595\u20131663 - The Dutch\u2013Portuguese War was an armed conflict involving Dutch forces, in the form of the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company, against the Portuguese Empire). Also to be noted the Treaty of Tordesillas, that divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the Portuguese Empire and the Crown of Castile, along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands, off the west coast of Africa. (this treaty is why spain had little to no possessions in Africa).The lands to the east would belong to Portugal and the lands to the west to Castile. The treaty was signed by Spain, 2 July 1494 and by Portugal, 5 September 1494. The other side of the world was divided a few decades later by the Treaty of Zaragoza, signed on 22 April 1529, which specified the antimeridian to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas. This treaty would be observed fairly well by Spain and Portugal, despite considerable ignorance as to the geography of the New World; however, it omitted all of the other European powers. Those countries generally ignored the treaty, particularly those that became Protestant after the Protestant Reformation. So as you can see it\u2019s not that they haven\u2019t tried it, we just have a rich past of whooping spanish ass - they tried to invade in europe, and treaties prevented the escalation of further disputes overseas.

            "answer_text": "Currently Spain has not any interest on invading Portugal. Portugal as a complete and finished country is much older that Spain. Portugal was established in 1143 (treaty of Zamora) as an independent kingdom separated from the kingdom of Leon. Spain started being shaped after the wedding of Isabel Queen of Castile and Fernando King of Aragon, Isabel got the Castilian crown in 1474 and Fernando inherited the crown of Aragon and Sicily in 1479. Years before in 1385 the pretentions of Castile and Leon to recover the former ducat of Portugal issued from the separation from Leon ended after the defeats of Aljubarrota and Valverde. In the Aljubarrota battle , the Portuguese army was supported by English archers and the Castilian army was supported by French cavalry. By a succession crisis kingdoms of Portugal and Spain were headed during 60 years (1580 -1640) by the Kings of Spain. After 1640 and after some fights, Portugal regained its independence. Since these dates, both countries have followed its separated lives. Being Spain larger more populated country than Portugal. I understand the Portuguese special sensitivity towards Spanish matters and to our attitudes towards them. In addition Portugal in a way is geographically 'strangled' by Spain. To reach by land the heart of Europe one Portuguese must travel either by train or car some 1.000 km, many through boring lands.

            "answer_text": "I'll give some historical background. Portugal was a province from Castilla reign that was given to Henrique. He was the father of our first king, D. Afonso Henriques. So when Afonso Henriques conquered a lot of land for the province, he called it independent and his mother (that was married to the Castilla king) tried attacking Portugal. We won the battle. So we appealed the Pope to recognize our Independence. So Castilla attacked again and once again we won. After that, the Pope recognized we had the strength to be independent and that's how Portugal was born Still Castilla wasn't convinced and they kept attacking us over and over and we kept pushing them back over and over. After few kings, there was a time where wour next in line would be a Spanish king. All the nobles wanted to be Spanish but not the people. They attacked us with our own warriors and the people fought them and won in one of Portugal's biggest victory: the battle of Aljubarrota. Suffice to say all this time, Spain was fighting the moors in southern iberian peninsula (I think up until 1450) while Portugal was done with that by the 1350s. After that, Portugal just expanded and became a huge empire with one of the best navies in the world. We made peace with Spain to divide the world. But it wasn't over. After a few years, again our king died without an heir and this time Spain just took our kingdom but it was devided. Also it didn't take long since 60 years later, we fought back and regained our independence. After that, it still was turmoiled and we kept them out for another 100 years when Napoleon attacked Portugal. 3 times they attacked, last one with Spain's help. 3 times we driven them out of our country, only losing one province to Spain. After a while, while fighting Spanish invasions still, we just matured and stayed friendly with each other. Tldr: you don't mess with Portuguese people. ",

            "answer_text": "Who says Spain didn\u2019t tried? In fact, from 1383 to 1385 Portugal was without king immerse in civil war due to the Portuguese king D. Fernando died without male descendant, only a daughter married precisely with the Spanish king D. Juan I who therefor felt he had right to the throne, despite the fact that Portuguese courts had chosen a new king, named D. Jo\u00e3o I; so the Spanish king invaded Portugal and confronted the Portuguese counterpart in Aljubarrota, being defeated due to a better positioning of the enemy, shorter in numbers but high in the terrain and with the use of innovative tactics. Later, from 1580 to 1640, Portugal was under Spanish crown: it was the Filipe\u2019s dynasty, when the king of Spain was also king of Portugal. Due to the disappearance of the young Portuguese king D. Sebasti\u00e3o - a teenager - in the battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir in North Africa, a huge disaster for the country since almost all the nobility perished, and the defeat of his legitimate successor his great uncle the old Cardinal-King D. Henrique, who died also without descendants. Filipe I (Felipe II in Spain) - 1527\u20131598 - was relatively well accepted by Portuguese elites since his mother was a Portuguese and he has been educated by Portuguese courtiers, and his successor Filipe II (Felipe III in Spain) - 1598\u20131621 -, also didn\u2019t interfere much in Portuguese affairs. However, Filipe III (Felipe IV in Spain) - 1621\u20131640 - delegated government in the Count-Duke of Olivares who used tyranny: by then. the idea of loss of independence was starting to unrest the people since Portuguese ships at the service of Spain were attacked by pirates and corsairs and the same happened with the colonies in Asia and Africa and also in the Brazil causing enormous losses, adding to the drain of Portuguese resources to sustain the wars Spanish empire was involved. Finally, on December 1st 1640, a group of conspirators from the nobility and the clergy, put an end to the Iberian union and acclaimed D. Jo\u00e3o IV as king of Portugal. But don\u2019t think Spanish king accepted well the outcome. Fortunately for the Portuguese rebellion, Catalunya had also rebelled by then forcing Felipe IV (of Spain) to deal with that first by sending troops to suffocate it, thus giving time to the recent again independent kingdom of Portugal to reorganize its military by then in a deplorable situation. When the king of Spain turned its attention to Portuguese rebellion the Portuguese were prepared and at last in 1665, some huge battles later, the peace was settled. ",

By the time of King Felipe II, his Empire was the largest the world had ever seen. All of Iberia, Belgium and Netherlands, parts of Italy and all the lands discovered and conquered by both Spaniard and Lusitan conquistadores. They were one Empire, one in which the Sun never set. And now Phillip II had a decision to make: Where to set up the new capital of Spain, and by extension of the world? Old Toledo was too small, too medieval for the 'superpower' of the time (neither France, nor England, nor Austria or the Ottomans were a match for the Spanish Tercios in those years), so a new seat of power was needed, and that's how Madrid was selected, looking inwards to Europe and the old Spanish center... and the rest is history.  A better selection that would have changed the fates of Spain and Portugal, and the world, forever? Ancient and Regal Lisboa, where the King could look to the Seas and to the New World, where riches and opportunities and power laid. *sigh* ",

            "answer_text": "They did.  When poor Portuguese King Sebastian went on a Crusade against Morocco and was never seen again. Despite the warnings of his uncle, the infamous King Philip II of Spain who actually liked him..  Because Philip was closest to the throne as his mother, Empress Isabella had been a Portuguese Princess he added Portugal to his impressive collection of countries.  However before Philip gained the Portuguese throne he had to to deal with the chosen King-Cardinal Henry , who reigned 1578\u20131580 and later on to chase away a pretender, a certain Don Antonio, another cleric. So things went not that smoothly..  The son of Philip II, King Philip III bent over backwards to guarantee the privileges of Portugal. But his son in turn, Philip IV, did not and even his capable vicereine, Margareth of Savoy, Duchess of Mantua, could not prevent the Portuguese struggle for independence.  So the King\u2019s widow, Maria Anna of Austria let Portugal go..  Napoleon I again gave Portugal to Spain in exchange for Catalonia but neither Portugal nor Spain appreciated this.. Napoleon was always generous with other people\u2019s belongings.. He did conquer Portugal however, but the smart Regent of Portugal took his whole extended family on some ships to Brazil and made history that way.. Wow, Titian and Velasquez on one answer! ",

            "answer_text": "First, what you call Spain is named this way since Modern Age. During the Middle Ages and till the XVII century, Spain meant the former Roman province of Hispania, which included Portugal, Leon, Castile, Navarra and Aragon. So everyone in Portugal was Portuguese and Spanish. The same applied to Castilians. Only after 1640 Portugal considered itself as non-Spanish as a sign of \"we are not ruled by the king in Madrid\". In fact, only with the Bourbons, the kings in Spain, called themselves \"Kings of Spain\". Usually they called themselves \"King of Leon, Castile, Aragon,  Navarra.....\" During the late Middle Ages, Castile had two options:  Go west and conquer Portugal, which was a Christian Kingdom (that was really important in those days), had allies, and could imply having problems with the Pope, or,Go south and conquer Muslim kingdoms with the Pope's blessing.As far as I know, the only times Castile tried to conquer Portugal was in 1385 and 1580. Both times Castilian king alleged having a claim over the Portuguese throne, which is the way a Christian king could fight another one. In 1580, King Philip II succeeded. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm sorry, but I think that you put the question upside-down. The question might actually be: Why did the Portuguese not conquer Spain? I'm Portuguese, and therefore suspect, but here are some facts about battles in Portuguese or Spanish territory:- Batalha de Elvas (Elvas Lines War -  Portugal won)- Batalha do Ameixal (Ameixal War - Portugal Won)- Guerra da Restaura\u00e7\u00e3o (Restauration War - Portugal won)- And one of the most important - Aljubarrota War (Portugal won)With a really small army (1 Portuguese for each 3 Spaniards)Portugal lost some battles with Spain, but lost fewer than the other way around. Most importantly, between the 15th and 20th centuries, the Portuguese territories were larger than all Europe, including: Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, East Timor, India (Goa, Dam\u00e3o, and Diu), Guinea Bissau, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, and Macau for 500 years.And other territories for a shorter time, like Bombay (Bombaim) in India. Portugal is the oldest country in Europe with virtually unchanged borders without changes since the 12th century. ",

            "answer_text": "All answers are very good, I just need to add a little personal context to the revolution of 1640. The Spanish king ordered the Duke of Bragan\u00e7a to train and arm 25 thousand men to go fight somewhere in Europe where the Spanish were meddling in the local affairs (Holland if I am not mistaken\u2026) The Duke met with his accountant and they both figured that the expenses of training and arming the 25 thousand were fixed and unavoidable because an order from the king was serious stuff in those days. But a considerable saving could be achieved in the transportation of said army, if instead of fighting the Dutch in Flanders, they instead fought the Spanish in Portugal. The Duke was attracted to the fact that, besides the transportation savings, he would then be promoted to King. The soldiers were happy with the arrangement, as they could take leave on the week ends and go home for some agricultural work and other chores their wives had listed. And so the fight to expel the Spaniards was an economic question, not necessarily a patriotic one. And the Dutch finally got their independence\u2026 Peace of M\u00fcnster - Wikipedia ",

During that time, Spain lost most of the Empire to the French and the Dutch. Then in 1640 Portugal recovered independence and reconquered almost all of the territory Spain had lost. Most of the great Spanish conquests were done by Portuguese (Magellan, Cabrilho) or Portuguese-trained (Columbus) sailors. The \u201cInvincible Armada\u201d was the Portuguese Armada with spanish flags on their masts. The Spanish Inquisition was a bunch of amateurs next to the Portuguese Inquisition. Spain surrendered to Napoleon, while Portugal fought back, not one, but THREE invasions by the troops of Napoleon - and won! The Spanish crown was more times close to fall in the hands of Portuguese kings than the other way around. Even during the Iberian Union, when the Spanish King was also the portuguese King, Portugal kept its independence - and when Phillip III tried to unify the two kingdoms, the Spanish were thrown out the window by the Portuguese. Conquered by Spain? In their dreams! ",

The Europeans dynasty are famous for inter-dynastic marriages, so they have an invested interest in each other\u2019s countries, which in turns would limit war; sabotage and would mean a boost for further cooperation on military affairs or economic affairs.  That way, they have conquered all of Europe indirectly while nobody at that time knew about it, that's why Portugal was never officially conquered by another European country directly but was controlled indirectly by those inter-dynastic marriages.

It is a little surmising that Castile did not invade, they did absorb various other kingdoms Muslim and Christian on the Iberian Peninsula through one means or another.   I suspect that the orientation of the Portuguese nobility was a factor as well as language in building a distinctive national culture.     And Andy mentioned the British.  This probably needs more emphasis  Another factor was the Pope.  Papal Bulls (formalized in the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) divided the world between Spain and Portugal.  After this invading Portugal would seem a clear violation pf papal authority.   After the onset of the Reformation, the Netherlands, France  (Huguenots), and England became prime targets.  Probably the Spanish had their hand full and as Portugal was safely Catholic did not see the need to launch another costly campaign. ",

Now, they are the subjects of a king of the French house of Bourbon and the other pretender is a French nobleman too. In 5 centuries, they have not had one king or queen from a Spanish dynasty, whereas the kings of Portugal are Portuguese and have been for 900 years now, with only 60 years of interregnum in the XVIth century.Simply put, in the Iberian peninsula there are several nations. One is independent, always has been and it's people won't stand for anything else  that's Portugal. The remainder are either submissive towards Castillian Madrid rule, or else wannabes, like the Basque or the Catalan. ",

            "answer_text": "The main reason is because Portugal, throughout most of its history as an independent nation, had a very powerful ally that went by the names \"England,\" \"Great Britain,\" and the \"United Kingdom\" at various points in its history, and this ally was extremely hostile to Spain during the era in which Spain would have attempted the conquest of Portugal, or when it attempted to regain control of Portugal after the Portuguese ended their personal union with the Spanish Habsburgs in 1640. For the same reason, Portugal never became a Napoleonic satrapy during the First French Empire, because the British helped defend it after Napoleon had foisted his brother on the Spanish throne. Except for the period between 1580 and 1640 when the Crowns of Spain and Portugal were united, the alliance between England/Britain/UK and Portugal has been in continuous force since 1386. (English assistance to Portugal actually dates back to the Second Crusade in 1147, but there was no formal alliance at that time.) After Portugal freed itself from the Habsburgs, it immediately reconfirmed the 1386 treaty. ",

Ferdinand & Isabella then concentrated on conquering Granada, & succeeded in 1492, thus completing the Reconquista. There were no more Moorish states in Iberia. The possibility of conquering Portugal during the Reconquista had thus ceased to exist. The brief window of opportunity had closed. ",

Portugal and Castille and Aragon were very tightly intermarried .. for the most part invasions simply were never necessary . Colonization on the other hand opened the world to a new brand of conflict most of which would not cause open warefare between nation's untill the beginning of the 1600s. Warfare in medieval times was not usually about the conquest of lands in Europe but more about settling claims to titles. For the most part conflict many times occured within a kingdoms own vassals and not with rival kingdoms. As a result warefare within the Iberian peninsula was a odd mash of Noble rivalries old scores and traditional crusading versus Muslim held lands . Though even that was not so black and white ",

So, we have always had powerful allies, beginning in the 12th century with the Venetian and Flemish merchants, the Duchy of Burgundy and the Pope, continuing in the 14th century with the English House of Lancaster, through to the 17th century with Burgundy (again), and with the French Crown (covertly, as France had a treaty with Spain under which it could not give aid to independentists in Catalonia, Andalucia or Portugal).

During the Moorish invasion in the early VIII century only small Christian enclaves resisted the Arab armies, namely the kingdom of Asturias in the northern part of the peninsula. With time, there were finally five kingdoms (around 1400), Aragon to the East, Navarra to the Northeast, Castille in the Center, Portugal to the West and the Moorish king of Granada to the South. The political entity called Spain only started to take shape with the marriage of Isabella of Castille with Ferdinand of Aragon in the XVth century. Portugal was already a sovereign independent country. There were several attempts throughout history to unify the peninsula via royal marriages but during the Reconquista the main task was to expel the invaders and not to fight among ourselves. , ",

Even so, Portugal was invaded by Spain a number of times, mostly when there was a succession crisis, being on such occasion during the 1383\u201385 crisis, where the Portuguese with the help of the English defeated the Spanish. Another one was in 1580, where the Spanish indeed conquered Portugal and ruled it for 60 years. In 1640 was a revolution against Spain, the Spanish Governor was thrown out of the window, the monarchy was reinstated and a holiday is held on tha day since then. You should also noticed that, while the Spanish monarchy allowed itself to be manipulated by the French in the Napoleonic wars, the Portuguese king went to Brazil and the ortuguese ket resisting, with the aide of Wellington and the English, to the French invasions.

Portugal had a significant number of Jewish people and once Spain occupied Portugal, Torquemada, one of the most evil men in history, gave the Jews a choice: convert, leave or die. Pretty much the same way he had done it in Spain itself.

In fact, there was two main attempts (and other minors): 1st In 1385, the Castile King adducing the dinastic rights of her wife made a try, and was defeated in the battle of Aljubarrota (the place in Portugal is very nice to visit). 2nd Due to the death of the King of Portugal (Sebastian I) in 1580 without direct heirs, there was a dinastica war between three candidates. In the end, the Spanish troops seize the country easily (the lasta campaingn of the Duke of Alba), and Phillip II (1st of Portugal) was Crown King of Portugal. The union lasted until 1641, when due to the maneouvres of Cardinal Richelieu (France was then in war with Spain), there was an uprising in Portugal wich ended in 1668 with the Lisboan Treatise, and the independence of Portugal.
