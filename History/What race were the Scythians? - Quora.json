            "answer_text": "According to most studies the Scythians were predominantly Caucasoid. But there were already some Mongoloid ones also. The term Scythian described more or less all nomadic people of ancient Central-Asia. Most of them were Iranian peoples, that means they were Caucasoid. But it is likely that there were already Mongoloid tribes that joined or lived in the same area. Later, Mongoloid groups get more and replaced the former Scythians. Turkic people, Yeniseians, Mongols, Tibetans and maybe some other Mongoloid groups conquerd Central-Asia and some other parts. So to sum up: the early Scythians were Caucasoid. The later and post-Scythians were mixed or Mongoloid (see Turkic Khaganate or Tibetan empire) ",
