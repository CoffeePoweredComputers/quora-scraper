            "answer_text": "Fully recover? By what standard? - There are almost twice as many restaurants open in New Orleans today than there were the week before Katrina hit. So by that standard, it recovered some time ago. - There are about 110% of the pre-Katrina population living in the \"sliver by the river\" (roughly, between I-10 and the Mississippi River), but the overall population is still down by 50,000 to 60,000 (depending on what source you read). - The police force is still about 25% smaller than it was the week before Katrina hit. - The permanent pumping stations are not in place yet. - There are thousands of former residents still living in cities like Atlanta and Houston. - There are now more tourists visiting on an annual basis than ever before. - There are a lot more hotel rooms available to house those tourists while they are here. - The first drug store just opened in the devastated Lower Ninth Ward this week. - There are still tons of blighted buildings (but there are fewer and fewer every month). New Orleans is a wonderful place, but it is not without its flaws (like any city). So the only real answer to your question is, some facets of the city recovered very rapidly, while others still have a long way to go. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no one right answer to this question, because New Orleans was changed forever by Katrina.  So, what does 'recovery' mean? I can't give you an answer supported by numbers, just the perspective of a resident, in which case I would say it took about 2 years for the city to become more-or-less fully functional again, and ever since then the city has been reeling this way and that like an Irish drunk due to the permanent re-booting of the whole school system, the huge emigration of people with money from other states, the renovating of the city's culture for the sake of tourism, etc. etc. but, truth be told, even today, I think there are still deserted neighborhoods that were left by the storm.  And you have to understand that many New Orleans residents never fully recovered.  Aside from the ones that are dead, many had their lives permanently over-turned and are still struggling with that.
