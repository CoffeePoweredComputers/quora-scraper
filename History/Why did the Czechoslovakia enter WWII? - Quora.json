            "answer_text": "Czechoslovakia did not enter WWII as an official subject, because - after the occupation of Czechia by Nazi Germans on March 15, 1939, Czechia became German protectorate Bohemia & Moravia (\u201cdivide and impera\u201d) and Slovakia left the day before Czechoslovakia and became an ally of Nazi Germany. But, many Czechs (and also some Slovaks - they made up around 15% of total amount) left their homeland and fought against Hitler, forming units as a part of foreign armies, above all British (fighting in Africa, the Middle East and during the invasion of Allied forces in France in 1944) and in the Soviet Union, where they formed \u201cCzechoslovak Army Corps\u201d. The most known is the role of Czech pilots in Royal Air Force, already fighting in France during the invasion in 1939 and later forming fighter and bombing squadrons in Great Britain (\u2116 310 Fighter Squadron, Duxford, \u2116 311 Bombing Squadron, Honington, \u2116 312 Fighter Squadron, Duxford, \u2116 313 Fighter Squadron, Catterick). Others were members of another RAF squadrons (British, Polish etc.). I would like to remind, that Czech fighter Josef Franti\u0161ek was the highest scored ace of the Battle of Britain.  ",

            "answer_text": "Czechoslovakia did not \u201center WWII\u201d in the conventional use of the phrase, because Czechoslovakia was occupied by Germany in early 1939 and divided into the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia and the Republic of Slovakia, with Hungary and Poland getting smaller pieces of the country at that time. Therefore, Czechoslovakia did not exist as a nation from before the start of World II until after the end of World War II. However, thousands of ethnic Czechs and Slovaks fought for the Czechoslovakian government in exile that was created after Germany occupied Czechoslovakia in 1939. ",
