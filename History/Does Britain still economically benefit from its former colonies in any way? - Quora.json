            "answer_text": "Nope. Far more money was spend in their maintenance then any profit for the country as a whole. Few individuals, obviously, profited but that is something else.That doesn\u2019t mean colonies were useless. Some colonies, such as India or American were great source of trade, and this was profitable, although in almost all cases the exploitation of these resources were not done by British, they paid for good, although typically had very good trade deals (as in you MUST trade with us). Colonies were about prestige, and about the idea of Mercantilism society whereby balance of trade was viewed as the best thing. This is a false thinking. What brings wealth isn\u2019t trade balance, but trade itself. Most countries never learned that and hence either collapsed (such as Spain) or struggled, such as Portugal. ",
