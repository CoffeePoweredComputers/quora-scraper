            "answer_text": "France has tons of advantages over Italy except one--geography. The area between France and Italy is mountainous and they don't have a very long border (only 515 km) so there isn't much room to maneuver.  Italy could probably therefore make a French invasion of their country practically impossible, due to geography and the fact they have enough forces to protect that border in depth. That's true even though the French military is certainly better, as other commentators have correctly pointed out. Naturally if France could not successfully invade Italy even though it is militarily stronger, Italy certainly could not invade France. So in a conventional war between France and Italy right now, nobody would win. Stalemate. ",
