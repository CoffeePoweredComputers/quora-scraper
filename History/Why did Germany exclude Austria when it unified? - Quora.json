            "answer_text": "Because Austria almost never was a part of Germany, only during the time from 1938 to 1945, when Germany forced Austria to join the Reich. After 1945 the Allied forces rolled back all the occupations of the 3rd Reich. Austria was occupied by the Soviet Union and the USA and stayed that way until 1955, when it was released into independence - under the condition to stay neutral in future. Parts of Germany in the East were occupied by Poland (which had lost territories in their East to the Soviet Union). After 1945 Germany was divided into 4 zones, one zone for each ally. The allies had agreed on a plan to run Germany as a whole country, but soon the Soviets quit that agreement and made an Soviet satellite state out of East Germany, the German Democratic Republic (GDR). So the Western allies put their zones together and formed the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). Over the decades the main goal always was to keep those parts of Germany together which still were German. In the first years even the GDR administration demanded the reunion of both German parts. Uniting the two Germanys had two major goals: 1. freedom to move for all Germans, so they could visit their relatives and so on. 2. rebuilding East Germany which was completely wrecked after 40 years of communism. These two objectives were irrelevant in the relations to Austria: There alsways have been good, tight relations between West Germany and Austria, it was no problem to travel between these countries. Besides this Austria became a rich, developed country. The reunion of Germany was one part of the collaps of the Eastern Block. The iron curtain decayed. So after unifying Germany, the next step was to unify Europe. The GDR had automatically become an EU member by merging with EU member FRG, other East European countries like Poland, Czech republic and Hungary were preparing for a membership. So Austria decided to give up their neutrality and to become an EU member in a referendum in 1994. Today there is no real need to tie Germany and Austria together tighter than in the EU. It would be like unifying Nevada and California, why should you do that? Another, psychological part: Austria is as guiltiy of the Nazi atrocities as Germany is. Once I read a study saying that the share of Austrians amongst the members of the Nazi party was higher than the share of the Germans - if you take into account the different sizes of population. The annexion of Austria was cheerfully awaited by many Austrians. After 1945 the Austrian society very soon developed a widespread attitude of rather having been a Nazi victim than a part of the Nazi movement. So some anti-German ressentiments are widespread amongst the Austrian people until today. So, after 1945 they never had the wish to become a part of Germany. And most Germans do not regad them as Germans. We rather see them as easy prey in soccer championships of all kind;-) And it is the same with Switzerland. Although most Swiss people speak some sort of German language, they are not Germans and do not like to be united with us. ",

            "answer_text": "Several reasons for the \u201cKleindeutsche L\u00f6sung\u201d (small German solution), due to dynastic and imperial issues. There are books about that, but for short: until 1806 in the holy roman empire the house of \u201cHabsburg\u201d had the German Kings Crown and the Caesar title over the whole Empire (Bavaria, Prussia, Saxonia, Hannover and so on)after that \u201cHabsburg\u201d got Caesar of Austria, no more King of Germany. Kingdom of Prussia evolved into all German efforts, when Austria got its KuK (kingdom of Hungary and Caesar of Austria) Empire, but stayed with its German parts in \u201cDeutscher Bund\u201d.In 1866 The \u201cDeutsche Bund\u201d declared war on Kingdom of Prussia but not only lost against Prussia but declared itself obsolete, when Prussia had annexed several soil from former \u201cDeutscher Bund\u201d (Hannover, Hessen-Nassau, and some more).From then on Prussia was the master of unification without Austria helped by the war declared 1870 from France as reaction to \u201cEmser Depesche\u201d. Austria did not participate in this war and the second rich (\u201czweite Reich\u201d) was declared in Versaille by the German nobles who participated.",
