            "answer_text": "First off, a lot of newspapers from this era are actually online (i.e. NY times) so you will get a better sense of what the different countries actually thought of at the time by taking the time to read these papers.  The German speaking newspapers gave it more press, unsurprisingly. (The Wiener Zeitung as I recall took up the whole front page with the typical German-Austrian black-bordered mourning stationary look and just had text surrounded by white space.)  It seems like, especially in English-speaking countries, the assassination was tragic in a rather far-off distant sort of way, but (particularly in America) Austro-Hungarian royalty just wasn't on people's radar the way the British monarch was. As far as I can tell, Franz Ferdinand's trips to the U.S. in the mid-1890s went actually rather unremarked by the U.S. press, which signals how under-the-radar he was then. Not that the assassination did not make big press -- it did make the front page of large and small newspapers. Everyone knew his nephew Karl (who was already in line after Franz Ferdinand) was now definitely the heir; Karl had married popularly (to Zita von Bourbon-Parma) and was generally more popular anyway than Franz Ferdinand ever was. (Although much pathos existed in regards to the three orphaned children of Franz Ferdinand and his wife.) You certainly see enough news bits in British papers (The Graphic for instance) about Franz Ferdinand from 1890 to 1914, but it's small snippets, and the German royals are getting as much, if not more, coverage during these years in English/British newspapers. (The Graphic covered the funeral of Franz Ferdinand quite nicely in an inset as I recall.) Also the assassination happened on what for some what was a banking holiday as well as general summer holidays--that is the beginning of July/August holidays. You'll read dozens of reports of how people went on holiday in July, and then got stranded in a foreign country when war suddenly breaks out in August. The fact is, though his assassination is a catalyst to World War I, it seems that knowing how politicians/diplomats reacted to Serbia's reaction to Austria's ultimatum is the real question here. Remember, there was nearly a month's delay between the assassination and declaration of war. The BBC film 27 Days is about this issue and might interest you. (Post edited to correct grammar).     ",
