            "answer_text": " Adolph Hitler with his homosexual chauffeur and lover, Julius Shreck. Hitler was responsible for the deaths and suffering of 100s of million people. He attempted to exterminate the Jews. He had intended to seriously decimate a good portion of several European populations and set about it. He brought disaster on the Germans themselves. Accusing AH of other matters is almost like saying he was a jay-walker in comparison to his major offences. We know from other sources and studies of Hitler that he was a sexual pervert, a hands -on murderer, a sadist, a masochist, a physical exploiter of females, and so on. Yair Davidiy's answer to Hitler allegedly suffered from chronic flatulence, chewed carpeting when angry, had a micropenis, was a coprophile, a sadist, a homosexual, and a Jew. These claims are unlikely to all be true. Which are most likely? At least 10 of the women Hitler had sexual contact with were later murdered, committed suicide, or attempted to commit suicide and henceforth remained wards of the Gestapo. Yair Davidiy's answer to Did Adolf Hitler really murder his niece or anyone else personally? It could be that such predilections were a facet of homosexuality. His sexual perversions and homosexual practices may have been all part of the same vice practiced by the same person. Nevertheless, in these notes we shall deal with AH and his homo-eroticism as an issue in their own right separate from his other diversions. Homosexuality is against the Bible. It is prohibited both for Gentiles and for Jews. Leviticus (NKJV) 18: 22 You shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It is an abomination. Leviticus (NKJV) 20 13 If a man lies with a male as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them. Despite it being a Biblical Transgression who really cares in this day and age what the sexual proclivities of AH were? It so happens that a lot of people care a lot! Quite a few learned followers of history who otherwise are against Hitler and the Nazis spring to his defense when the subject of Homosexuality comes up. Why is that? Perhaps part of the answer is to be found in the attitude towards the book, \"The Pink Swastika: Homosexuality in the Nazi Party,\" by Scott Lively and Kevin Abrams, USA, 1995. The authors claim that not only was AH homosexual but so were most of the leading Nazis. Not only that but the phenomenon of Naziism, they claim, needs to be explained as an outcome of the Homosexual Kamp Kulture! Lively and Abrams have been soundly excoriated for their study. I wonder why? I doubt that Homosexuality was the main culprit responsible for Naziism but it may have been a contributing factor. Hitler said that his fondest childhood memories were of \u201csleeping alone with his mother in the big bed\u201d while his father was away at work. Contrary to other claims his mother as well as his father were sexually voracious. Not so long ago homosexual inclinations were associated with a mother-complex from infancy. At all events, An adolescent friend of Adolph, August Kubizek, speaks of adoration and love with the young Hitler, a shared kiss and being naked together in an isolated area. Hitler moved to Vienna and lodged in houses known as homosexual recruiting grounds. From there he moved to Munich. Samuel Igra (\"Germanys National Vice,\" London, 1945, ch. vi, pp. 66 ff) reports that Engelbert Dolfuss (Chancellor of Austria, assassinated by the Nazis in 1934) had certified copies of an affidavit made and entrusted to the diplomatic representatives of governments in Vienna including those of Italy and the Vatican. # Among others, Dr. Hermann Rauschning assured me that he had seen a copy of such a document, which was in the hands of a foreign government. It declared that Hitler had been a male prostitute in Vienna at the time of his sojourn there, from 1907 to 1912, and that he practiced the same calling in Munich from 1912 to 1914.# Source: https://ia801603.us.archive.org/17/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.80851/2015.80851.Germanys-National-Vice_text.pdf This report together with other evidence may have been what led Benito Mussolini (himself no prude), to refer to Hitler as \"that horrible sexual degenerate.\" In WW1- AH served as part of the German forces, in the 16th Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment. Other members of this regiment included Rudolf Hess, Hans Mend, Max Amann, and Ernst Schmidt. Before the War Scmidt had been a painter and decorator. He became a dispatch-runner alongside Hitler. Lothar Machtan, the author of \"The Hidden Hitler\" (2001) has pointed out: \"They [Hitler and Scmidt] were invariably to be seen as a couple, not only when jointly delivering regimental orders to brigade or battalion, but off duty behind the lines.\" Schmidt told a journalist eighteen years later \"I was very much drawn to Hitler\". Hans Mend, a fellow dispatch-runner, later claimed that Schmidt and Hitler had a sexual relationship. \"We noticed that he (Hitler) never looked at a woman. We suspected him of homosexuality right away, because he was known to be abnormal in any case. He was extremely eccentric and displayed womanish characteristics which tended in that direction. He never had a firm objective, nor any kind of firm beliefs. In 1915 we were billeted in the Le Febre brewery at Fournes. We slept in the hay. Hitler was bedded down at night with Schmidt, his male whore. We heard a rustling in the hay. Then someone switched on his electric flashlight and growled, Take a look at those two nancy boys. I myself took no further interest in the matter.\" Source: Ernst Schmidt In early 1919 Schmidt met up again with Hitler, joined the Nazi Party, and became politically active in Nazi affairs. In December 1939 Hans Mend, who had served with both Hitler and Schmidt, revealed to the Media the homosexual relationship that had existed between Hitler and Schmidt. Consequently he was incarcerated and died in prison. Hitler as an up and coming politician was introduced to important members of German society including the rich and powerful. Some of them were homosexual. Igra claims that they worked through a network of their own. These connections included members of the family of the Musician, Richard Wagner (1813\u20131883). A male member of the Wagner family later claimed that Hitler molested him. See: The Hidden Fuhrer: Debating the Enigma of Hitler\u2019s Sexuality. Machtan cites notes left by Eugen Dollmann, Hitler's interpreter, that there was police evidence from this period that Hitler had paid young boys to spend the night with him. Max Amann had served in the same Regiment as Hitler and Schmidt. Amman and Hess participated in the 1923 Munich coup attempt headed by General Ludendorff and Adolph Hitler. In Landsberg prison Hitler dictated \"Mein Kampf\" to Hess. The nicknames of Hess (given by fellow Nazis) were \u201cFraulein Anna\u201d and \u201cBlack Emma.\u201d Hilter was called \"Fraulein Adolf.\" Ernst Hanfstaengl, who had once been a friend of Hitler, testified that Hitler and Hess had a sexual relationship. Hess was a known homosexual. Letters from Hess exist that testify to his homosexuality. See: Yair Davidiy's answer to Why was Hitler\u2019s sidekick Rudolf Hess nicknamed \u201cFraulein Anna\u201d? Adolph Hitler and Ernst Rohm  Source of Picture: Ernst R\u00f6hm: The Highest-Ranking Gay Nazi Whose Power Even Hitler Feared Rudolf Hess and Ernst Rohm were both prominent early Nazis and homosexuals. Hitler used the Germanic familiar term \"du\" (reserved for very close associates) almost exclusively with them and not with others. Rohm openly boasted of his homosexuality. Rohm considered homosexuals to be a kind of \"Chosen People\" liberated from the inhibitions of conventionality and destined to lead the nation. Igra claims that Hitler was inclined at first to agree with Rohm in this regard. Hitler changed his mind when representatives of the military (through President Hindenberg) and leading industrialists made it clear to Hitler that it was either them or Rohm. After that Rohm and others in the SA were killed (along with from 700 to 1000 others) in the \"Night of the Long Knives\" of 1934. Hitler surrounded himself with bodyguards and chauffeurs who were homosexuals. One of these was Julius Schreck with whom Hitler had an affair. When Shreck died of meningitis in 1936 Hitler wept for several days. Shreck received a State Funeral that was attended by most of the Nazi notables. At some stage Hitler had contracted syphilis. The after effects remained with him and were treated by his private physician, Dr. Theodor Morell. This doctor along with another physician, Karl Brandt, who also had administered to Hitler described him as of homosexual inclination. See: New Evidence from His Doctors Shows Hitler Was Gay | Breitbart Hitler had only one testicle and may have have also always suffered from some degree of sexual dysfunction. Upon becoming Chancellor he appears to have moderated or ceased his homosexuals activities though continuing his other perversions. Walter C. Langer's 1943 report for the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) describes Hitler as having repressed homosexual tendencies and opined that he was an impotent coprophile, i.e. he liked women to defecate on his head. Psychologist Henry Murray wrote a separate psychoanalytical report for the OSS in 1943 that drew similar conclusions. Otto Strasser, one of the early opponents of Hitler in the Nazi Party, also told his post-war interrogators a similar story. Hitler is described in the report by Langer as having frequent nightmares that involved being penetrated from behind. The evidence indicates that Hitler was bi-sexual. He used women in a perverted way. Nevertheless he may have preferred their company. His relationship with Eva Braun did not include sexual relationship or at least not more than a one-time unsuccessful effort. In his earlier years he had been more potent but then had spent his energies in homosexual activities. If that was all he had done we would forget him. There are many like him. His historical transgressions were on another scale altogether. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a popular speculation and he might have experimented but all the evidence is he wasn\u2019t. He had some affairs when he was younger and was faithful to Eva Braun. He was in love with a girl when he was a teenager but was afraid to approach her. Adolf Hitler's sexuality has long been a matter of historical and scholarly debate, as well as speculation and rumour. There is evidence that he had relationships with a number of women during his lifetime, as well as evidence of his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence that he engaged in homosexual behavior. His name has been linked to a number of possible female lovers, two of whom committed suicide. Another died of complications eight years after a suicide attempt, and one made a failed suicide attempt. Hitler created a public image of a celibate man without a domestic life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation of Nazi Germany. His relationship with Eva Braun, which lasted nearly 14 years, was hidden from the public and all but his inner circle. Braun biographer Heike G\u00f6rtemaker notes that the couple enjoyed a normal sex life. Hitler and Braun married in late April 1945, less than 40 hours before committing suicide together. Two wartime reports by the Allies attempted to analyze Hitler psychologically. Walter C. Langer's 1943 report for the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) describes Hitler as having repressed homosexual tendencies and opined that he was an impotent coprophile. Psychologist Henry Murray wrote a separate psychoanalytical report for the OSS in 1943 that drew similar conclusions. Otto Strasser, one of Hitler's opponents in the Nazi Party, also told his post-war interrogators a similar story. British historian Sir Ian Kershaw describes Strasser's statement as \"anti-Hitler propaganda\". In research following Hitler's death, a variety of claims have been made about Hitler's sexual orientation: that he was gay, bisexual, or asexual. Conclusive evidence is lacking, but most historians believe he was heterosexual. There is at least one claim that Hitler had an illegitimate child (named Jean-Marie Loret) with one of his lovers. Mainstream historians, such as Ian Kershaw, dismiss this as unlikely or impossible. Sexuality of Adolf Hitler - Wikipedia One of his best known affairs was with an aspiring singer, his niece Geli Raubal, that ended badly when she apparently shot herself. Hitler\u2019s women have a nasty habit of suicide attempts. There is speculation Hitler shot her. Her death is unsolved. Circumstances surrounding her death are suspicious and there was a coverup. The following link is an interesting read. The Unsolved Murder of Hitler\u2019s Half-Niece and His Romantic Obsession As he rose to power as leader of the Nazi Party, Hitler was domineering and possessive of Raubal, keeping a tight rein on her. When he discovered she was having a relationship with his chauffeur, Emil Maurice, he forced an end to the affair and dismissed Maurice from his service. After that he did not allow her to freely associate with friends, and attempted to have himself or someone he trusted near her at all times, accompanying her on shopping trips, to the movies, and to the opera. Raubal was in effect a prisoner, but planned to escape to Vienna to continue her singing lessons. Her mother told interrogators after the war that her daughter was hoping to marry a man from Linz, but that Hitler had forbidden the relationship. He and Raubal argued on 18 September 1931\u2014he refused to allow her to go to Vienna. He departed for a meeting in Nuremberg, but was recalled to Munich the next day: Raubal was dead from a gunshot wound to the lung; she had apparently shot herself in Hitler's Munich apartment with Hitler's Walther pistol. She was 23. Geli Raubal - Wikipedia This kind of controlling behavior is well known to therapists and precedes physical abuse. Murder sometimes follows. The abuser will isolate his love object and begin to control her movements. We don\u2019t know that Hitler abused Geli but he was very possessive. Murder cannot be ruled out although the evidence points towards suicide. Hitler appears to me to have been inexperienced with women and emotionally immature. My impression is he was unfulfilled and needy so that he might become attached, clingy, and possessive if a woman showed him affection. People who knew her said Geli was bewitching. One woman reportedly had this to say about her: \u201cI saw her and I just stopped dead. She was just so tall and beautiful that I said nothing. And she saw me standing there and said, \u2018Are you frightened of me?\u2019 And I said, \u2018No, I was just admiring you.\u2019 She was just so tall and beautiful. I\u2019d never seen anyone like that.\u201d   Geli was said to be an \"enchantress\". Her effect on both acquaintances and strangers is well documented. Her tragedy is Hitler, once captivated, wouldn't let her go.  Eva Braun  Stefanie Rabatsch, Hitler\u2019s had a teenage crush on her. He planned a murder suicide but changed his mind after she tossed him a flower during a parade. Adolf Hitler and Stefanie Rabatsch - Wikipedia ",
