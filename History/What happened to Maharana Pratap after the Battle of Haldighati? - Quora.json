            "answer_text": "In 1572, when \u2018Pratap\u2019 was throned as the King of Mewar, Akbar started his attempts to regain control of his kingdom. He even sent his messages of peace but Maharana was aware of Chittorgarh battle and was not someone who would melt with his sweet words. Several fellow chiefs of Maharana including his own brothers \u2013 Shakti Singh, Jagmal and Sagar Singh \u2013 served Akbar as commanders or members of his council. Akbar sent six diplomatic missions including his brother-in-law Bhagwant Das and his son Man Singh to Pratap for a peaceful alliance like he did with other Rajput chiefs, but of no use. Once Maharana even agreed for an alliance but it later failed as Pratap refused to be personally present at the Mughal court. By not falling prey to Akbar\u2019s words, Maharana defied Mughals. And this resulted in the \u2018Battle of Haldighati\u2019 in June 1576. The four-hour battle was between Pratap and Akbar led by Man Singh I. Akbar\u2019s army had 80,000 soldiers while Maharana\u2019s army consisted of 25,000 soldiers that included Rajputs, Afghans led by Hakim Khan Sur and a small contingent of Bhil tribals.Rumours of the Mughal emperor Akbar coming on the battlefield instilled a sense of courage in the Mughal troops and they surrounded Maharana\u2019s army and at the time when Maharana would have certainly been killed, the Naik of Jhala took the crown off Maharana\u2019s head and put it on his own head posing as Maharana and got himself killed.Grabbing an opportunity Rana aimed his spear on Man Singh but unfortunately it pierced his Mahout\u2019s body.The Mughal army once again surrounded Maharana but his favourite horse \u2018Chetak\u2019 help him to rescue successfully but died as it had sustained injuries. Maharana escaped unhurt. With Maharana Pratap able to make a \u201csuccessful escape\u201d, the battle failed to break the deadlock between the two powers. Subsequently, Akbar led a sustained campaign against the Rana, and soon, Goganda, Udaipur, and Kumbhalmir were all under his control. The Mughals were the \u2018victors\u2019 and inflicted significant casualties among the Mewaris but failed to capture Pratap, who escaped. Pressure was exerted by the Mughals upon the Rana's allies and other Rajput chiefs, and he was slowly but surely both geographically and politically isolated. The Mughals' focus shifted to other parts of the empire after 1579, which allowed Rana Pratap to recover much of the lost territory in the western parts of his kingdom. Chittor and the rest of eastern Mewar continued to remain under Mughal control. When almost all his allies submitted themselves to Akbar, Maharana Pratap had no one for his support. Besides, he was left with no money to support his own army. It was during this time he got a huge support from \u2018Bhamashah\u2019 which helped Maharana Pratap in building and maintaing his army. In addition, he also acquired great support of the tribal King Raja Punja Bhil with whom he built a new army. The Bheels supported Maharana Pratap till he breath his last. Haldighati is often claimed to have been a battle for Rajput or even Hindu honour against the Muslim Mughals. However, considering that both sides featured the Hindu Rajputs, and the Mewar army was also served by Hakim Khan Sur's Muslim Afghans, any arguments concerning religious conflict have little credence. According to Satish Chandra, the Battle of Haldighati was, at best, \"an assertion of the principle of local independence\" in a region prone to internecine warfare. Honour was certainly involved. But it was the honour of Maharana Pratap at stake, not Rajput or Hindu honour. ",

            "answer_text": "Haldighati was the start of open confrontation and use of violence/war between the mighty Mughal Empire and the single state of rowdy and strong Sisodias of Mewar.  My village falls in Sirohi district bordering Mewar. Our area is called Godwar. At the time of Maharana Pratap. He had following allies, Deora Chauhans of Sirohi, Rathores of Idar, Hada chauhans of Hadoti i.e Kota & Bundi. All of these allies where at different times attacked by Mughals for supporting/protecting Maharana Pratap. Still they remained allies. Imagine the times of Haldighati, the fear of the mighty mughals and the turks. Turks had overturned major empires all along eurasia and large parts of Asia. But in form of Maharana Pratap Singh they hit a wall. Pratap Singh was Symbol of resistance to oppression of these foreigners. The Afghans descendants of Sher Shah Suri & Tanwars of Gwalior found refuge in the realms of Maharana. Haldighati was a symbol that these daredevil sons of Mother India can be outnumbered, outgunned, empoverished but will never turn their back to the call of duty of their beloved motherland.  By the way one amusing fact is that till this day in my village at the time of festival of Holy, all the tribes sing a song which says that \" Inform Mannsingh of Amber that you have betrayed us and attacked our motherland of Aravali, We the brave sons of this Ancient Aravali shall get together and attack your homeland.\" My forefathers fought with kings of these part of world. My village and adjoining areas were given to my house as Jagir. My grandfather who was a British Matric pass told me about Haldighati, how Maharana attacked different commanders of Mughal Army. Such was the first wave of attack from Mewar's army that the mughal army fell back upto 25 miles. Mewar's army was just 1/4th of mughal army in terms of numbers, further it was mostly newly trained tribes of hill folks. Yet they decimated mughal army, immediately mughal army used their best weapon of choice the artillery, best in the world and the strongest. Mughal cannons threw fire upto several miles. Yet undetered mewar army continued their rout. Such was the spirit of sacrifice amongst mewar army that few soldiers pushed their heads in cannons to make them dysfunctional. Seeing such desperate scenes the Mughal army trembled and started fleeing, at this point in time Mann singh of Amber entered the battle which as such was against general startegy of mughal warfare. The supreme commander of Mughal army in a war used to supervise the army from relatively safe spot on battle filed and only suppose to give the fatal blow to the enemy yet, such was the scene in battlefield that Mann Singh was forced to enter the battle field with huge reinforcements. Maharana personally moved towards Mannsingh, a mughal commander accompanying Mann Singh Bahlol Khan shouted at the top of his voice \" Is Kafir ki Aulaad ko Kaat dalo\", Those were the last words spoken by poor Bahlol Khan on this planet. Immediately, Maharana attacked Bahlol, and without wasting time on him since he wanted to attack Mann Singh, In one swift and powerful strike of his heavy sword, Maharana Pratap cut Bahlol Khan alongwith his horse in TWO PIECES. Terrified Mughal Army watched in dismay, the Mewar army watched in pride the prowess of its Maharana. Mughal Army threw everything it had to save Mann singh from the same fate as Bahlol Khan. A showers of Arrows, Lances, Bullets, Cannons were on Maharana's head but like Arjun's concentration Maharana was measuring the distance from where he could be sure that his mighty lance stood a chance to kill Mann Singh. With full momentum provided by Chetak by jumping on the elephant carrying Mann Singh, Maharana used final strength he had saved all the way fighting to get to Mann Singh, The lance in all its glory pierced the howrah throughly killing the mahout of the elephant. Maharana thought he got his intended target and let out his war cry \" HAR HAR MAHADEV\", such was the loudness of the cry that the battlefield itself fell silent and watched. It was kind lot similar to the cry let out by Bhim when he killed Dushashan, only difference was that here the petrified Mann Singh had ducked the lance and did not have courage to attack back on Maharana until he was few paces away surrounded by the elite mughal guard wanting to avenge their commander. Maharana was forced by his commanders to leave the battle field not commit the same mistakes as Maharana Sanga and other Rajput Warriors had done earlier which was to fight to finish, it was here that it was decided to live and fight another day. Haldighati as a battle was won, but none of the objectives given by Akbar were accomplished by Mann Singh. Maharana was alive not captured or killed as Akbar wanted, the power of Maharana was moved and may be even decreased but was not completely extinguished. After, Haldighati several expditions with similar objectives were sent by Akbar, but all failed. Meanwhile Akbar himself was impressed by Maharana's bravery. It is well known in Rajasthan, how Akbar reacted to Maharana's death. Akbar was sitting in his Darbar, when it was informed \" Jahanpana Mewar ke Maharana Pratap ab nahi rahe\" Akbar bit his tongue in sadness and said Hindustan me ek toh esa mila jo mera muqabla kar sake.
