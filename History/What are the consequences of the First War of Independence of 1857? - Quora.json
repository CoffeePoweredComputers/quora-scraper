The result \u2013 India was no more controlled by British East India Company.India came under the direct control of the British crown.Kingdoms that were loyal to the British Crown, were allowed rule under the Queen's name.Queen Victoria was proclaimed as the Empress of India. All of India became her subjects.The feeling and need to revolt was crushed for the next 50 years.Brought down India\u2019s contribution of world GDP from 25% to less than 2%.Made India an offshore resourcing space to fight British wars around the world.Contributed to tens and hundreds of famines throughout the country. Bengal being the worst hit.Contributed to the racial/class/caste/religious divide.In all the defeat of 1857 contributed to the ruining of India for close to 90 years of slave and servitude attitude. Well, in some sense, it continues even today\u2026 ",
