            "answer_text": "Great question, Darren! There's no question that Col. Tom Parker played a major role in Elvis Presley's career. I believe that Elvis' talent was such that he would have become a superstar even if he had never met Parker.  The Colonel didn't enter Elvis' orbit until 1955. By then Elvis had risen from a nobody to a major regional star. Given time, I think Elvis was on his way to capturing national attention. Here's what Parker did: He moved the timetable forward at an amazing pace. He created hysteria by paying girls to scream or rush the stage. It only takes a few to start it before it catches on with the crowd. Col. Parker also had connections that Sam Phillips didn't. By mid-1955 Phillips knew he had taken Elvis as far as he could. It was Parker who negotiated  Elvis' deal with RCA, who got Elvis national TV spots. These are things that I believe would have happened to Elvis in time. So, Colonel Parker's contribution to Elvis' career was to stir things up and make it happen sooner. All in all, Elvis needed someone like the Colonel in mid- to late-1955 to about 1958, when he was solidly crowned The King. After that, Parker became less a kingmaker and more a leech on Elvis' finances. His refusal to let Elvis do international tours cost the Presley estate millions of dollars. It was Parker who pushed Elvis to make his formula movies, rather than do live appearances. In fact, Parker's insistence on the \"sure-thing\" Elvis beach or race car films may have cost Elvis a chance to be a major movie star. Barbra Streisand wanted Elvis to star with her in \"A Star Is Born,\" but Parker nixed it. There are stories of other producers or directors wanting Elvis in non-singing, quality films, but Parker wouldn't risk his hipshaking cash cow. ",
