            "answer_text": "The five principal advantages of pub ad as optional are: First, Public Ad is one of the finest optionals for UPSC with a thin syllabus and instrumentality of topics for GS paper II of Mains also, apart from some coverage of topics from polity through the study of Pub Ad Paper II (Indian Administration). Second, the probability of netting questions in UPSC mains exam from what you have studied is maximum for Public Administration due to TINA factor ( There is no alternative). The TINA factor is on account of thin syllabus of the Pub Ad, UPSC has no option but to ask questions from the limited expanse of the subject. Third, it is one of the few optionals that can be covered in three months serious study of 6\u20138 hours daily. Never get hoodwinked with those who compare it with Anthro, Sociology, Pol Science. The syllabus of these subjects ( Anthro, Sociology, Pol Science) can drown you, especially if had no academic background in undergraduate or PG study. Fourth, the close examination of GS paper 4 (Ethics) 2018 question paper will amply clear the fact that no more UPSC asks commonplace questions rather technical questions are being asked in jargon-free simple language which is in the ambit of Public Adm viz. foundational values of public service, public interest, RTI as accountability concept etc.. (For more See references to answers of questions in the trustworthy book for Ethics GS IV for UPSC Which is a trustworthy book on ethics integrity and aptitude for civil services preparation? ). Fifth, the last advantage is also interesting in the sense that you are already acquainted with the theory and structure of your job as the public/civil servant when you qualify UPSC mains. You know your professional habitat much better than successful candidates with other optionals.

Administrative Thinkers by Prasad and Prasad Indian Public Administration: Institutions and Issues by R.K. Arora IGNOU BA notes for Indian Administration. Ethics, Integrity, and Aptitude in Governance by Ranvijay Upadhyay The last one is also immensely helpful for students of Public Administration optional as aspirants may answer to questions in Pub Ad Mains paper 2018, worth 175 marks in Paper I and 120 marks in Paper II in a very structured, logical, and marks fetching manner.  PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION Mains 2018 PAPER I : Questions with answers in SAGE Ethics book: Question No. 1(b), 1(d), 2 (b), 3(b), 4 (c), 5(c), 6(a), 6(b), 6(c), 8(a), 8(b), 8(c).

            "answer_text": "Public Administration since its inclusion as an optional subject in Civil Services Examination has been a popular subject. Public Administration is a multidisciplinary subject. We find inputs of Psychology, Economics, Sociology, Political Science, Law, Anthropology & Management. The beauty of Public Administration is the availability of limited core concepts. A student has not to be perplexed with plethora of facts. Interlinkages of topics is another speciality of Public Administration. In other words, once a student has mastered a concept, he/she can apply that concept in other parts of the syllabus. For Public Administration, a student has just to refer 3-4 standard books which cover the whole syllabus. From the Institute student will get qualitative study material.After the change in pattern of examination in 2013, Public Administration is the optional subject that covers maximally the syllabus of General Studies. A student will have direct help from Public Administration in about 15 questions in preliminary examination.In the Main examination, the second paper of General Studies excluding International Relations is part of Public Administration. In the third paper of General Studies, topics like Internal Security are directly related to Public Administration. In the fourth paper of General Studies, nearly fifty percent of the topics are related with Public Administration. In the paper of essay which checks candidate\u2019s ability of flow of ideas, coherence of ideas etc. the nature of Public Administration will be a helping tool the candidate in essay paper. Also topics of essay will also be related to Public Administration. It has been a noticeable trend for Public Administration in UPSC examination, that a candidate is getting either good marks, or poor marks. A candidate gets good marks because of good understanding of the subject & ample awareness about recent developments. Lack of understanding, emphasis on rote learning, unaware about recent developments cause poor marks. ",
