            "answer_text": "A more detailed answer avaialable here: Nathan Reed's answer to Did ancient Egyptians look like modern Egyptians or what are their differences? Firstly I\u2019d like to mention I am an egyptolgist whom base of research is on primary sources. Conclusions are made with the best of arguments and the least amount of bias. Through my research, like every egyptologists before me, I have found the egyptians to be native africans, or \u201cblack\u201d people. Must know fact: Migration happened, was documented and should be taught alongside the ottoman empires expansion from arabia into africa. It\u2019ll save us egyptologists plenty of time. Arabs today are open in their non-native identity however to boost touring egypt began claiming they were \u201cnative\u201d egyptians which the new generation buys (think how european migrants were taught they \u201cown\u201d america and canada and natives dont). In every \u201cnorth-african\u201d nation they\u2019re plenty of natives around. Keep reading and you\u2019ll learn something new. But first, where are these mystical egyptians we\u2019ve fantasized about?\u2026In Egypt    Thanks to great documentation from the Ottoman Empire we are aware of an arab migration to north africa however millions of native north africans exist today, with plenty in Egypt. There is preference however to paint egypt as an arab nation since arabs are the group in power and dominate the major cities. It\u2019s just how the americas is seen today as mainly \u201cwhite\u201d or \u201cblack\u201d instead native \u201cmongoloid\u201d (lack of a better word). You\u2019d hardly find a native american in new york right? BERBER AND THEIR HISTORY Today you can find native egyptians everywhere however they are slowly being painted as \u201cimported african slaves\u201d or african migrants and so are native berber tribes. Ironically, many european slaves were spread across north africa, arabia and parts of asia. Think of the kablye berbers: one tribe with two groups today. One being the native populous who are and have historically been described as \u201clight brown to dark brown/black skin\u201d africans (meaning native. Can vary from elongated african (beja) to tropical (mali)) with \u201cvarying degrees of curly black hair\u201d. The second, and more famous group, are the descendants of vandals. Can you guess which group is having it\u2019s history rewritten? (hint: not the group that pops up in google) Kabylia (meaning mountainous regions) berber:    Kabyle (vandal) berber (note the balkan like clothing):    Furthermore the name of the nomadic natives, berber, is an archaic term of a large familial group/nation that once existed in central- horn of africa called berbera or berberois (greek). One of the world\u2019s ancient port cities, berbera of somalia, still carries the name today. The theory of berber deriving from barbarian is a fallacy. Later the term would be taken by arabs and greeks to denote people whom they saw as \u201cberbera\u201d, later becoming \u201cslang\u201d for native north african. The theoretical \u201coriginal\u201d berbers are found within groups whom were traditionally xenophobic such as the tauregs, zanata, etc. One theory lies \u201cBerber\u201d culture/language spread from these groups to other saharan groups with a migration out of the horn 4000+ yrs ago. Taureg berber specifically are considered the original berbers. Although residing in the in many countries, tauregs on average look identical to horn africans till this day sharing linguistic, cultural and biological relations.   But tauregs don\u2019t all look alike. Many subtribes and clans are present, leading their xenophobic ways to not always work. The paleness ( in females) can be due to bleaching as yellow skin is ideal but the strong \u201carab\u201d look is likely mixing. Not every ethnic group stays \u201cpure\u201d. Even parts of china people are wedding african migrants. However, china is still chinese.  (Compare black scarfed woman with women are far right woman)  There\u2019s no question whom the egyptians were in the field of egyptology however politics plays a heavy role. Due to key features such as skull measurements, hair type, skeletal frame and such, egyptians continuously match to a general group known as \u201celongated africans\u201d who are indigenous *today* to the sahara into the sahel belt (from east to west) and the horn of africa. ELONGATED VS NON-ELONGATED AFRICAN Elongated meaning bone structure is small and long, with faces being more narrow and nose bridges raised. These people tend to live in sahara like areas or tropical saharas (horn). Hair texture also varies in these populations with the highest instance of lesser tight curled hair on average, although still present. Due to racial prejudice they can sometimes be labeled \u201cnon-african\u201d by defining african as tropical african. This is like stating tamil indians as africans. It\u2019s ignorant.      Tropical africans tend to have bones of any ratio however their overall build is different in proportions to elongated africans. Build isn\u2019t as \u201clanky\u201d and skull shapes tend to be more rounded and wide. It\u2019s assumed the climate calls for such traits. Foreheads are lower and medium sized and noses are well shaped. This look emphasizes the eyes creating a cat-like look.     SKULLS AND COLONIAL RACISM With skulls, it isn\u2019t the skull shape that matters but the details which gives identity to the skeleton. Each ethnic group in a region carry multiple variations in skull points\u2014forehead curvature, jaw angle, cheekbone protrusion, etc\u2014 and skeletal frame\u2014femur length, bone density, etc\u2014that point to specific group. Colonial created categorization allowed northern europeans to claim everything they shared with other groups as their own with the most extreme belonging to the latter. Terms like \u201cmongoloid\u201d (a people), \u201ccaucasoid\u201d (a region) and \u201cnegroid\u201d (a colour) were created to suit their psuedo-science of race at the time. although they hardly work. These groups should be mega categories and not \u201cracial\u201d ones. should be They give the general idea of a persons face NOT their race/ethnicity/ancestry. Markers are key points, not general shapes. The caucas mountains are nowhere related to a dravidians skull nor is a mongolian to a khoisan. Khoisan woman who, with these three skulls becomes a \u201cmongoloid\u201d. Maybe in 1000yrs, this european biased approach will lead to a theory claiming a great asian people living in southern africa, hence the \u201cyellow\u201d skin too? The skulls aren\u2019t race related.  That is why stating \u201cegyptians skulls are caucasoid, hence they\u2019re arab/white\u201d is laughable to specialized anthropologist. Human diversity has no boundaries in colour. What is \u201ccaucasian\u201d is large, broad nose bridges, protruding jaws/chins, shorter limb ratios and pale skin. That\u2019s about it. Every other feature is shared by whites and non-whites globally.  Compare his face with that with an elongated african:  Both generally \u201ccaucasoid\u201d yet in detail completely different. One lives in the northernmost part of the world and the other by the equator. Not the same group. Which people here appear \u201cafrican\u201d, \u201ceast asian\u201d, \u201cwhite\u201d, \u201carab\u201d etc? Do you see a japanese face? Maybe a tanzanian man or greek?  Egyptian mummy reconstruction  Its the taking advantage of saharan africans phenotype that paints egypt as a \u201ccaucasoid\u201d race. A little closer and you\u2019ll notice the bulbous african heads of the mummies (examples below). We must move past colonially induced ignorance of race. Otherwise there will be very confusing times ahead of use. Egypt is just the start. If this basic human categorization continues perhaps we\u2019d find the mughal empire was actually irish. Why? Because the skulls look \u201cthe same\u201d. But are they same? No. ANCIENT EGYPTIAN PEOPLE Ramses\u2019 nose, although not uncommon in africa, was stuffed to prevent deflating over time. Nonetheless, his looks can be found anywhere in elongated groups.  From skeletal remains, pottery and hairstyles, it\u2019s been solidified since the 1800\u2019s that everything egyptian stemmed from the native populations of it\u2019s lands, completely foreign from \u201carab\u201d like populations in the sahara today and eurasia as a whole. Today, they\u2019re are nearly no connections to ancient egypt among \u201carab\u201d north africans (including copts) and found with other populations in the regions. Although some amatueur anthropologist or stirclty \u201cwhite\u201d egypt egyptologits would state this due to \u201carabization\u201d, an anthropologists stand here would be to ask said person to awknowledge this isn\u2019t an \u201copinion\u201d or argument of theory but stone-cold facts. Given the support of historical docs, the average north africans oral history, aswell as biological testing its without a doubt the arabs of north-africa are not native to the sahara whereas the \u201cafricans\u201d are. EGYPTIAN CULTURE Religious beliefs, clothing style, cultural practices and even their gods (later adopted by greece) were practiced in north-east africa with strongest prevalence within the horn (somalia and oromia) today. For instance, god Rah is named after the sun Rah in somali, however, to move past their pagan pasts, it became qor-rah= neck of rah. Note that coptic pronunciation for the sun is ray same to english as qor-rah\u2019s rah is identical to ancient egyptian pronunciation of Rah. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of egyptian hairstyles. They are native to north-east africa such as small mini-braids, butter ringlet curls or shaped afros. Here\u2019s a modern photo of the common female braided bob found on statues. Of course, a royals would be neater.  Here is one hairstyle identical to the ancient egyptians. It once exsisted quite commonly among youthful men throughout upper africa but has died in antiquity. Now it\u2019s traditionally done by the afar of the horn of africa. This find has startled egyptologist since the time of champolion that these ancient customs still exist. Of course length would vary.   A very african hairstyle. From a fro to curls:  A well perserved statue and painting crossed with a somali man in the center. (Had the wood oxidized the white skirt would be brown aswell)  A north-east african dress vs a painting. Again, times have changed. Accessories can\u2019t all be gold.  This isn\u2019t bias nor should be seen as afrocentric. It is as valid and supported as stating ancient greeks were from greece and not india and that the ming dynasty as han chinese not russian. There is some discomfort in relearning a civilizations history. That\u2019s where we find our own biases.  A man from Saqqara, one of ancient egypts Capital cities. It is attested they did migrate from a place named pun-ta (bun-da) or punt from teh lower north-east up to the sahara to populate it. This in turn explains the cultural and genetic link between lesser mixed egyptians and the horn africans of today\u2014the greatest \u201cafrican\u201d haplogroup in egypt stem from native north-east africans. Sahel african types (beja, afar, somali, nubian (northern)) lived and continue to live as high up as lower egypt, into the sudan and and once into lower tanzania so this, anthropologically speaking, isn\u2019t surprising. Below are a few more photos of native north africans from around the sahara. Native Libyan berber   Harar (horn africa) women: Part of the mega berbera family, they aren\u2019t berber but cultural similarities remain. (head scarves are for modesty hence europes)  Berberized eurasian/arab (henna was/is used in uppper africa since anc. egypt)  Berber (taureg) women:  Mix of berbers (although woman in the front can be a pale berber and not mixed)  (note the deeper skinned berbers in the back vs the woman in the front) Zaghawa woman   A bit of culture adoption. It doesn\u2019t matter if gypt was black, white, yellow or neon green however when speaking on the matter the most recent, unsullied and *honest information should be utilized. There shouldn\u2019t be racism or emotions tied to the identity of a people. They are who they were.  Ps- the test conducted earlier this year connecting egyptians to levant people was not valid. The mummies tested were hkysos (persians, bottom right) from a hyksos town during the time of the hkysos migration into egypt (likely forefathers of the copts and some saharan bedouins today). There were 4 egyptian mummies in the tomb to test but they were omitted. 3 from 60+ mummies in whole were tested with none being egyptian.  SKIN DEPICTION AND BEAUTY IDEALS Aswell, the colours within egyptian art tend to reflect the saharn/horn africa cultural ideals. Aside from the gold skin gods/woman (often mistaken to be \u201cwhite skinned\u201d supporting a non-north-east african egypt) the typical colour of the portraits for men are browns with red hues whereas women have yellow hues. At times they are the same. This embodies the self proclaimed \u201cred\u201d skinned-ness of north-east africans.  A typical and quite popular portrait. Other artworks with paler skinned egytians tend to be few in number and often are artworks of migration/slave workers or isolate non-egyptian people.  Skin tones reflecting the cultural and reality of native north-east africans  Here\u2019s a good comparison. We should be look outside the colonial mindset of colour. One that had taught all \u201cAfricans\u201d (because africa is a country\u2026) can only be drawn with dark brown skin even if they aren\u2019t. This photo can be of a tan woman however it also matches the woman beneath. Perhaps it was made with her colour in mind?  Or these woman  Important Gods were painted in yellow signifying gold. Not sure why many female gods weren\u2019t \u201cretouched\u2019 back to their original bright yellows and left tan.  Egyptian \u201cred\u201d man and \u201cbrown/yellow\u201d woman:  Red skinned man and boy:   Brown to yellow hue women:   This red man to a brown/yellow hued woman is an ideal that exist today within sahara/north-east africa today. Although subconcious to most, the ideal becomes quite clear with couples.    Aswell, there are a few interesting skull to face comparison online of native north-east africans along side some egyptian mummies. They\u2019re very intriguing. For anyone to state these skulls aren\u2019t \u201cAfrican\u201d purely are drowned in colonial brainwash. With everything written, the most important takeaway is remember the egyptians who are forgotten. North africa isn\u2019t \u201carab\u201d but african with recent migrants and others from circa 3000yrs ago. Due to our bias however, an entire branch of humanity who are remanents of a pre-migration to africa group, may be forgoten forever. If amateur researchers aswell as racially biased \u201cegyptologists\u201d are able to blatantly negate the truth of egypt, what other history can they change. Thank you for reading this far and I hope you\u2019ve learnt something new.       (This one is quite humorous i find.)  Thank you for your time :) ",

During the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, the foreign invaders who proclaimed themselves rulers of ancient Egypt, a sovereign land, were \u201cwhite\u201d. This is long after Egypt was ancient. Egypt\u2019s hey day was between 3,100\u20131,000 B.C.E. The Graeco-Roman period started in 332 B.C.E.

Quote(s): \u201cThe fact is the ancient Egyptians were BLACK SKINNED AFRICANS WHO HAD MIGRATED NORTH FROM CENTRAL AFRICA over many thousands of years and many \"Culture Phases\". Among them: The Qadan culture (13,000 - 9,000 B.C.), The Badari culture (circa 4400 B.C.), The Amratian culture (4500-3100 B.C.), The Amratian (Naqada I), started as a parallel culture to the Badari, but eventually replaced it. In the middle of the fourth millennium B.C, the Gerzean/Naqada II culture superceded the Naqada I. In the next period, known as Naqada III, Egypt has by now, been split-up into many administrative/territorial divisions, known as Nomes - this heralds the beginning of Dynastic Egypt. \u201cAncient Egyptian civilization was, in ways and to an extent usually not recognized, fundamentally African. The EVIDENCE OF BOTH LANGUAGE AND CULTURE REVEALS THESE AFRICAN ROOTS. THE ORIGINS OF EGYPTIAN ETHNICITY LAY IN THE AREA OF THE SOUTH OF EGYPT. The ancient Egyptian language belonged to the Afrasian family (also called Afroasiatic or, formerly, Hamito-Semitic). The speakers of the earliest Afrasian languages, according to recent studies, were a set of peoples whose lands between 15,000 and 13,000 B.C. stretched from Nubia in the west to far northern Somalia in the east. They supported themselves by gathering wild grains. The first elements of Egyptian culture were laid down two thousand years later, between 12,000 and 10,000 B.C., when some of these Afrasian communities expanded northward into Egypt, bringing with them a language directly ancestral to ancient Egyptian. They also introduced to Egypt the idea of using wild grains as food\u201d.

Quote(s): \u201cConservative Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt shows ancient Egypt derived from an African cultural foundation. \u201cThe evidence also points to linkages to other northeast African peoples, not coincidentally approximating the modern range of languages closely related to Egyptian in the Afro-Asiatic group (formerly called Hamito-Semetic). These linguistic similarities place ancient Egyptian in a close relationship with languages spoken today as far west as Chad, and as far south as Somalia. Archaeological evidence also strongly supports an African origin. A widespread northeastern African cultural assemblage, including distinctive multiple barbed harpoons and pottery decorated with dotted wavy line patterns, appears during the early Neolithic (also known as the Aqualithic, a reference to the mild climate of the Sahara at this time). Saharan and Sudanese rock art from this time resembles early Egyptian iconography. Strong connections between Nubian (Sudanese) and Egyptian material culture continue in later Neolithic Badarian culture of Upper Egypt. Similarities include black-topped wares, vessels with characteristic ripple-burnished surfaces, a special tulip-shaped vessel with incised and white-filled decoration, palettes, and harpoons... Other ancient Egyptian practices show strong similarities to modern African cultures including divine kingship, the use of headrests, body art, circumcision, and male coming-of-age rituals, all suggesting an African substratum or foundation for Egyptian civilization..\u201d Source: Oxford Encyclopedia of ancient Egypt, Vol 3. 2001 (p.28). EVIDENCE OF THE OLDEST RECOGNIZABLE MONARCHY IN HUMAN HISTORY, PRECEDING THE RISE OF THE EARLIEST EGYPTIAN KINGS BY SEVERAL GENERATIONS, HAS BEEN DISCOVERED IN ARTIFATS FROM ANCIENT NUBIA IN AFRICA.   Dr. Keith C. Seele In 1962, a research team headed by Keith C. Seele, Director of The University of Chicago Oriental Institute Nubian Expedition, discovered a pharaonic dynasty in Nubia that predated the first pharaonic period in Kemet (Egypt). This is an area that extends from northern Sudan to southern Kemet. In some literature it was referred to as ancient Ethiopia, or as in the Bible, Kush. Today, it is called Ta-Seti (Nubia).   Dr. Boyce Rensberger On March 1, 1979, The New York Times carried an article on its front page, written by Boyce Rensberger, with the headline: \"Nubian Monarchy Called Oldest\". In the article, Rensberger wrote: \u201cEvidence of the oldest recognizable monarchy in human history, preceding the rise of the earliest Egyptian kings by several generations, has been discovered in artifacts from ancient Nubia.\" He estimated that \"The first kings of Ta-Seti (Nubia) may well have ruled about 5900 BC\u201d. Qustul in Nubia Quote(s): \u201cScholars from the University of Chicago Oriental Institute excavated at Qustul (near Abu Simbel \u2013 Modern Sudan), in 1960\u201364, and found artifacts which incorporated images associated with Egyptian pharaohs. From this Williams concluded that \"Egypt and Nubia A-Group culture shared the same official culture\", \"participated in the most complex dynastic developments\", and \"Nubia and Egypt were both part of the great East African substratum\u201d.
