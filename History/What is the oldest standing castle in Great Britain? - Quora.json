            "answer_text": "Standing is a tricky one, so you'll probably want more than just earthworks. So as others have already stated the 3rd century Portchester Castle is an easy candidate, as bits are still habitable, and we know when and why it was built:  Then again Beeston Castle has a largely intact gate house, and a few walls, but is not habitable, but as this one started out as a Neolithic settlement c3500 BC settlement, went through the Bronze age and became an Iron age Hill fort c600BC, to later become a Norman castle, it's got some history:  Similarly Edinburgh Castle may have its origins in the Bronze or Iron ages, and it's habitable, but it's earliest defensible state and date are unknown.  You also have Colchester Castle which started out as a 1st Century Roman temple, and was hastily turned into a castle, between 1069-1076. So it's foundations, and some of its walls are older than Porchester, and the Keep is older than the Tower of London, but it only became a castle in the 11th Century.   Edit: There are also hundreds of Iron age Broch scattered around Scotland, there's some debate as to whether they're fortresses as such, but they are definitely standing, imposing and date back to around 100 BC.

            "answer_text": "Possibly Maiden Castle, Dorset  This dates back to 600BC  It is not the \"towering keep\" of cliche, but it does have some serious impressive earthworks with ditches & banks that still survive, and it is clearly a \"defensive wall\" If you want a \"proper castle\" then there are any number that date back, at least in part, to the Normans.  Between 1066 and 1087, William established 36 castles, although references in the Domesday Book indicate that many more were founded by his subordinates.  The new ruling elite undertook what has been described as \"the most extensive and concentrated programme of castle-building in the whole history of feudal Europe\".  They were multi-purpose buildings, serving as fortifications (used as a base of operations in enemy territory), centres of administration, and residences.  The White Tower in the Tower of London  dates back to 1078 Another iconic castle Corfe Castle  - this too was Norman and started at the same time - although the current building dates from 12th Century  (it was destroyed in the civil War). Interestingly it is only a few miles from Maiden Castle.      ",
