            "answer_text": "Quote often very little. The XIVth century was also plagued by frequent famines, starting with the Great Famine tht hit central and northern Europe in 1315\u201317.  The Black Death originated in Eastern Europe and moved across Western Europe in 1346 and until 1353. Italy, Spain and Ireland had been weakened by famines in 1339\u201340, then famine hit France, Italy, and Spain in 1346\u201347, again France and England in 1349\u201351. These famines helped mine the health of the population who, weakened by the lack of food, were more subject to getting sick.  The relationship between plagues and famines is typical and it\u2019s observed in many instances. For instances, the London plague of 1369 occurred during the famine that hit England in the same year. 1628\u201332 were famine years in Italy, and in the same years a plague outbreak hit northern and central Italy, Switzerland, and other nearby areas. In the same years, northern Italy also saw lots of wars which also contributed to both famine and plague (which was spread by the troops movements). The Black Death was actually the opening act of the second world plague pandemic, which raged from the XIVth and until the early XIXth centuries (with decreasing virulence). Plague remained endemic throughout this period, with a few scattered deaths each year, but on most years it didn\u2019t cause large outbreaks. But when climatic fluctuations and war triggered famines big epidemics (not only of plague, but also of a score od other deadly diseases) were almost granted to occur. ",
