            "answer_text": " \u201cJefferson Davis, president of the fallen Confederate government, is captured with his wife and entourage near Irwinville, Georgia, by a detachment of Union General James H. Wilson\u2019s cavalry.\u201c \u201cOn April 2, 1865, with the Confederate defeat at Petersburg, Virginia imminent, General Robert E. Lee informed President Davis that he could no longer protect Richmond and advised the Confederate government to evacuate its capital. Davis and his cabinet fled to Danville, Virginia, and with Robert E. Lee\u2019s surrender on April 9, deep into the South. Lee\u2019s surrender of his massive Army of Northern Virginia effectively ended the Civil War, and during the next few weeks the remaining Confederate armies surrendered one by one. Davis was devastated by the fall of the Confederacy. Refusing to admit defeat, he hoped to flee to a sympathetic foreign nation such as Britain or France, and was weighing the merits of forming a government in exile when he was arrested by a detachment of the 4th MichiganCavalry.\u201c \u201cA certain amount of controversy surrounds his capture, as Davis was wearing his wife\u2019s black shawl when the Union troops cornered him. \u201c  \u201cWhen Union soldiers captured Confederate President Jefferson Davis -- purportedly wearing his wife's dress and shawl -- on May 10, 1865, Barnum was not the only northerner to make a spectacle of the bizarre event. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton clothed a mannequin in a dress, hoopskirt, and shawl; had photographs taken of it; and distributed the photographs to the press. Newspapers ran sketches of the photo, like the one above (the technology to reproduce photos in newspapers did not yet exist). Later, Stanton claimed to have acquired the actual dress from Davis' wife and held a massive press conference to display \u201c \u201cThe Northern press ridiculed him as a coward, alleging that he had disguised himself as a woman in an ill-fated attempt to escape. However, Davis, and especially his wife, Varina, maintained that he was ill and that Varina had lent him her shawl to keep his health up during their difficult journey. Davis spent two years as a military prisoner at Fort Monroe near Norfolk. Confined to a small room known as a casemate, he was monitored by soldiers who ensured that he ate, made no escape attempt, and did not commit suicide. Later, Davis was moved to spacious quarters in the officers' hall and was allowed visitors and exercise. In May 1866, his wife, Varina Howell Davis, took up permanent residence at Fort Monroe. Although an unauthorized biography suggested that Davis was treated poorly, Davis himself did not believe that to be the case. He was transferred to civilian custody on May 13, 1867, and then released on $100,000 bail.\u201c \u201cAmericans were divided on how or whether to punish Davis. The government could prosecute Davis for alleged participation in the Lincoln assassination, for the mistreatment of Union prisoners of war, or for leading a rebellion against the United States. U.S. president Andrew Johnson favored murder charges. Many abolitionists and lawmakers opposed punishing Davis, and instead preferred a Reconstruction plan that would punish the former Confederacy. Yet many civilians wrote the president asking for Davis to be hanged; some even volunteered to construct the gallows. The Davis issue remained prominent in public discussion in 1865 until it gave way to other Reconstruction issues, such as the rights of black freedmen. When the Lincoln conspirators' trial failed to establish a connection to Davis, Johnson settled on treason charges.\u201c  \u201cThe government charged Davis with treason against the United States for organizing and arming the 1864 military invasions of Maryland and the District of Columbia during the American Civil War (1861\u20131865). The defendant demanded a trial as the best forum for proving the constitutionality of secession, and the government requested numerous delays to prepare its case. Although the indictment was finished in March 1868, the Johnson impeachment further delayed the case. The court finally heard preliminary motions in December 1868, when the defense asked for a dismissal claiming that the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution already punished Davis by preventing him from holding public office in the future and that further prosecution and punishment would violate the double jeopardy restriction of the Fifth Amendment. The court divided in its official opinion and certified the question to the United States Supreme Court. Fearing the court would rule in favor of Davis, Johnson released an amnesty proclamation on December 25, 1868, issuing a pardon to all persons who had participated in the rebellion.\u201c \u201cAfter enduring two years of imprisonment and nearly four years of uncertainty, Davis became a free man. The incomplete prosecution of his case and others' gave clear indication that the government intended Reconstruction to realign southern society rather than punish a select few leaders for causing the rebellion.\u201c \u201cImprisoned for two years at Fort Monroe, Virginia, Davis was indicted for treason, but was never tried\u2013the federal government feared that Davis would be able prove to a jury that the Southern secession of 1860 to 1861 was legal. Varina worked determinedly to secure his freedom, and in May 1867 Jefferson Davis was released on bail, with several wealthy Northerners helping him pay for his freedom.\u201c \u201cAfter a number of unsuccessful business ventures, he retired to Beauvoir, his home near Biloxi, Mississippi, and began writing his two-volume memoir The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government(1881). He died in December 1889.\u201c Confederate President Jefferson Davis captured by Union forces https://lostmuseum.cuny.edu/archive/the-clothes-in-which-davis-disguised-himself Jefferson Davis ",

            "answer_text": "He was captured and imprisoned in Virginia.  For a short time, maybe a year it was a rough imprisonment -chains, no books or visitors, then a bit looser.  His bail was set at 100,000.  Roughly 1.5M today.   There were motions filed to prosecute him, oddly enough, for the invasion of Maryland and Washington D.C. (the issue of the South was too difficult legally to parse).  This cartoon reveals how little sympathy there was initially for Davis, whose complaints about poor food are dismissed by former soldiers who lived off moldy hard tacks during the war:  The indictment certainly displayed fire: \"United States of America, District of Columbia, County of Washington, to wit: The jurors of the United States of America, within and for the County of Washington aforesaid, in the District of Columbia aforesaid, upon their oath present: That JEFFERSON DAVIS, late of the County of Henrico, in the State of Virginia, Yeoman; being an inhabitant of and resident within the said United States of America, and owing allegiance and fidelity to the said United States of America, not having the fear of God before his eyes, nor weighing the duty of his said allegiance, but being moved and seduced by the instigation of the devil, wickedly devising and disturbing the peace and tranquillity of the said United States of America, to disturb the Government of the said United States of America, and to stir, move and excite rebellion, insurrection and war against the said United States of America ...the said JEFFERSON DAVIS, afterward, to wit, on the said 15th day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, at the County of Henrico aforesaid, in the State of Virginia aforesaid, being then and there leagued in conspiracy with a large number of insurgents and false traitors, waging open war against the said United States of America, for the subversion of the Government of the said United States of America, and being then and there the leader and Commander-in-chief of the said insurgents and false traitors, with whom he, the said JEFFERSON DAVIS, ... did unlawfully, maliciously, and traiterously order and command a great multitude of said insurgents and false traitors, who were then and there, to wit, at the County of Henrico aforesaid, in the State of Virginia aforesaid, on the day and year last aforesaid, unlawfully and traitorously assembled and banded together to a great number, to wit: to the number of twenty thousand persons and upward, and who then and there acknowledged, recognized and obeyed him...\" It goes on.   In 1867, his bail was covered by an unlikely group of people - an abolitionist, a wealthy industrialist and the Northern newspaper editor Horace Greeley. They wanted reconciliation, and it was the general trade made at the time - reconciliation over punishment.  It never went to trial.  By 1868, a pardon from President Andrew Johnson removed the threat of a trial.  Davis lived 22 years after his release.  He became President of a Life Insurance company and wrote several books.  He was always a Confederate - he accepted the termination of the war but continued to lecture and speak to crowds about 'The Cause' until his death.  He was not universally popular in the South as many blamed him for the fall of the Confederacy, but in older age he was respected and his funeral was a big event.  20,000 mourners attended in New Orleans for the event.  A funeral train then went through Southern States to Richmond Virginia.   This is the train in Raliegh, NC.    In 1978, President Carter restored citizenship to Davis, posthumously.  ",
