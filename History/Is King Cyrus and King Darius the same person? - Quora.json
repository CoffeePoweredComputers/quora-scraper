            "answer_text": "No, they are different. Cyrus \u0964\u0964 of Persia, also known as Cyrus, the Great, was born in 600 or 576 BC and died in 530 BC. He founded the first Persian Empire, called the Achaemenid Empire. He was the patron and deliverer of the Jews. He issued the decree of liberation to the Jews. His edict for the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem marked a great epoch in the Jewish history. It was later questioned and denied by authorities, but Darius \u0964\u0964, who was the ruler, caused a search for the lost edict, to be later found in the archives at Ecbatana and the work resumed. Darius \u0964 or Darius, the Great, was the fourth king of the Achaemenid Empire. He was born in 550 BC and died in 487 BC. He ruled over a vast empire. ",
