            "answer_text": "The fervent Democratic hope that they will be able to \"win\" Florida in 2012. Ending the embargo would largely lose the Cuban vote in FLA. Not that Floridians of Cuban descent would be likely to vote for Obama.A general (and rather odd) disregard of the Caribbean (other than Haiti), Central America and South America (besides Brazil) by the Obama Administration. UPDATE to this 2011 answer: The Obama Administration has significantly eased the trade embargo between the United States and Cuba in 2015. While the embargo hasn't been completely lifted, it has been relaxed to the point where its ultimate end will become a reality in the near future. ",

            "answer_text": "Listen! Obama was too audacious to do that. Else, it is convenient to the american establishment to have a block wall. That you can see as Trump\u2019s wall, too. Someone said that USA keeping the kids in the cages with Patriot Act, or so! That is the life: you must protect yourself, else Messi will score! But, sometimes you have to risk in order to win a profit or benefit. I am with the new gain named \u201cprobit!. Comes from the proconomy added to the economy.  Also, I am adding the providence to the politics, so all embargoes will be lifted. And, with my disarmament army we will be clean and clear from any partial weapons. Have a successful risk! ",
