            "answer_text": "Well, let's se. Both these families are legendary for their wealth and financial savvy. Both Rothschilds and Medicis were bankers and financiers. Both meddled with politics. Despite living in very different eras, they were very much alike. But it is extremely difficult to estimate the net worth of both families. That is for a myriad of reasons: lack of well preserved documents, secretive nature of certain operations of those families, conspiracy theories, exaggerations et ceter. But I actually don't think that an extensive research is required here. Probably some logic and common sense would be just enough. Let\u2019s take a closer look at both families. The Rothschild Family  Rothschild coat of arms. Looks regal. The dynasty was founded in the end of the XVIII century by Mayer Rothschild, a Jewish banker from the city of Frankfurt. He was a prominent businessman and a true financial genius, who built a foundation of his family fortune. Mayer\u2019s son, Nathan, moved to London to further his family's interests. Sons of Nathan then proceeded to open branches of Rothschild bank in other capitals of Europe. Their vast family empire soon stretched all across the globe. There is a popular story about Nathan Rothschild, who spread rumors of British defeat at Waterloo, thus crushing London stock market. This story is not true and was invented for a Nazi propaganda movie \u201c\"The Rothschilds\u201d. There are also myriads of conspiracy theories about the Rothschild family. I personally like the one, which claims that the family's current net worth is 500 trillion dollars, which is ridiculous, because such sum exceeds the whole world GDP by a huge margin.  That is not true! If somebody looks like Montgomery Burns from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d, it doesn't mean he is evil. It is still difficult to estimate the exact net worth of the Rothschild family at it's peak in the second part of the XIX, but let's just say that they had a lot more opportunities than the Medici. The whole world in the period of the Industrial Revolution was opened for the Rothschilds. Rich and interconnected world gave much more opportunities for profit than the Renaissance Italy, to which the Medici business was virtually limited. So let us just say that the Rothschilds earned much more by the means if commerce and business than the Medicis did. They just had better conditions for doing business. The Medici Family  Medici coat of arms. Modest, but stylish. Medici family originates from the city of Florence in Italy. Unlike Rothschild, they never limited themselves to business and many of them run for political offices in the Florentine Republic. In the end of the XIV they were de facto rulers of the city. Bur ambitions of the Medici family were never limited to Florence alone. In 1513 the Pope Leo X was elected. He was a descendant of the Medici family and as Pope he virtually got control over all the resources of the Catholic Church. He became the most powerful person in the world, rivalef only by the greatest kings and emperors. In effect, he also became the richest person in the world.  Pope Leo X in the center  Also Pope Leo X by Fernando Botero And Leo was not the only pope from the Medici family. Three other Medicis occupied the office after him. And each one controlled all the immeasurable wealth of the Church, along with all the Papal State, which before Napoleon occupied quite a lot of land in central Italy. So let just say, that the Medicis were richer. Medicis win! Although it was not a fair competition. Using government and Church to get rich and powerful is definitely cheating. ",

            "answer_text": "You cannot really compare them because these two financial dynasties operated in completely different centuries. The Medici operated from the 15th to the 18th and the Rothschild from the 18th onwards. The time spanning the first dynasty was one of unfettered capitalism not hampered by any form of democracy, whilst the latter was in the exactly opposite sphere. You must also remember that there were other dynasties that ran concomitant with the first and were probably equals, the Fuggers especially, not forgetting the French wiz, jacques Coeur, who was ranked the richest individual in his lifetime 14/15 century. The Rothschild family is, through its various enterprises, quite possibly the richest family on the planet, which the Medici were not. ",
