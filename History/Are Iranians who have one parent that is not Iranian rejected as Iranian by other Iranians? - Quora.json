            "answer_text": "Its hard to say without looking at a large population sample of half-Iranians. I am one, and can say that I have had a mixed reception from Iranians (just as I have had with Americans), which is entirely normal. Half-breeds anywhere will meet with the same double-edged sword: nationalists will either only value us if we are subservient to Iran, or will suspect us of not being fully loyal. They will correctly identify us as an eventual destructive influence, given that we are the wages of entropy. Others will find us interesting, and a great learning opportunity, and will value our perspective since we are a bridge between cultures and races. In the case of Iranians (and perhaps in general) the answer about whether a half-breed finds acceptance depends on where the other parent is from. I imagine that a half-Arab or a half-Afghan would have a harder time than a half-European or half-white-American child, because of the prestige of the later and the negative views about the former among a subset of Iranians. In the beginning, when half-breeds were rare, they were probably highly prized or highly admired. I recall that I received a lot of favorable treatment from Iranians, many times, and that this made my life much easier. Because my mother is American, Iranians found me to be very useful as a translator and a go-between. However, had my mother been an Arab, Afghan or from Somalia, or from somewhere less useful or prestigious, I\u2019m sure my experience could have been very different. Iranians are generally obsessed with skin color and race. They share this trait with all of the people of Iran\u2019s neighboring countries. This is normal, of course. Who isn\u2019t? I know of a boy whose father is Iranian and his mother is Indian. When his mother saw how dark he was, she rejected him and abandoned both him and her Iranian husband. The attitudes that PC Westerners have about trying to be accepting of everyone regardless of race is not necessarily the norm of human behavior everywhere. So its important to be realistic, and to understand people\u2019s motivations. Few people are immediately interested in you for your own sake. They see you as a symbol of something they want or hate or need, etc. Or they find you entertaining. But few know what its like to be you, when they don\u2019t share your lot or walk in your shoes. And vice versa. As time goes on and the numbers of half-breeds increase (due to the philandering Iranian men), this may likely change. Half-breeds - even the ones of a white parent - may eventually find less acceptance. Any culture has only a certain capacity to sustain something, and nothing lasts forever, including the fascination and romanticizing of the half-breed. ",

I will probably have more mixed relatives in the future, which will be from Northern Europe, Southern Europe and East Asia. Some of them can\u2019t speak Persian but my grandmother does not care and talks Persian to them because that is the only language she speaks properly (though, they understand it, just can\u2019t speak). But, as in every country in the world, they surely differ from the majority, especially if they cannot speak Persian or did not grow up in Iran. Though, that is not a bad thing, not many foreigners come to live in Iran, so Iranians are fascinated and obsessed with anything which seems foreign. ",
