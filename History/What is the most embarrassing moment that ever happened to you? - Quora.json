            "answer_text": "Warning: Some people may find this a little graphic\u2026 My husband and I have two dogs, Sasha and Koda. Sasha is older, and Koda is probably about 3 now. As many dog owners do, we enjoy walking our dogs through town sometimes. We lived in New Hampshire, not far from Manchester. Manchester NH has a large downtown, with a wide street, and very wide sidewalks lined with restaurants with outdoor patios. We leashed up, and headed down the strip enjoying the sights. It should be noted here, that at the last moment, I decided to leave my purse in the car. My purse, which contains everything one could ever need. Anyway, Koda, still very curious, kept pulling at all the smells and whatnot. There were many times she would be ahead of me and then stop to smell. I\u2019d let her sniff, walking past her, but since Sasha and my husband were walking ahead, I would give her a little tug once she\u2019d reached the end of the leash behind me. She would then bound ahead of me, ready for her next adventure. One such tug I noticed she was being particularly difficult so I turned around and my whole face went white. I grabbed my husband\u2019s shirt who then turned, and upon seeing my ghostly complexion, looked down at Koda. The look on his face went from concern to horror. I glanced around us\u2026 We were directly in front of the door to a restaurant. The people in the restaurant\u2019s outdoor patio were all staring at us. My worst nightmare was coming true. Precious, tiny, Koda was taking a monstrous dump, right there on the sidewalk. But it gets better\u2026. I had tugged at her a few times, and apparently, each of those times she'd let one go. There were three little poop nuggets, and one large pile. My husband had, at the time, severe anxiety in social situations, and I suppose this counted. I, however, immediately sprung into action. I handed him the leash and told him, in no uncertain terms, to make sure no one stepped in it while I went in and got a bag. The hostess of the restaurant ran to the back to grab one for me, and as I exited, bag in hand, I was greeted by my second worst nightmare. My husband was facing the opposite direction. He had totally shut down. To his left was a guy, early 20\u2019s, scraping poop from his shoe onto a light post, while screeching \u201cThat was the biggest shit EVER!!\u201d and looking furious. His friends were a mixture of disgusted and amused. The once nice neat steaming pile waiting to be bagged was now ground into the sidewalk. Restaurant patrons were gagging, some laughing. The server that came out looked at me with an odd mixture of anger and compassion. My husband, my darling, darling husband, then looked me dead in the face, AND TOOK OFF. He just left, started walking away! I was baffled. I was attempting to pick up ground in sidewalk shit, and he just left me! He couldn\u2019t handle the embarrassment. I was LIVID. Who does that!? I got as much up as I could, issued a hurried apology to the poor people trying to eat amidst the fiasco, and totally ignored poop shoe guy, because I was pretty sure my apology would just have made it worse for him. Plus there was a possibility he\u2019d murder me, and I honestly just couldn\u2019t take anymore. I threw the poop bag into the nearest trash can, and hurriedly followed my husband, who was now about 200 yards ahead of me, furiously walking the dogs away from the scene of the crime. I assume he was searching in vain for a hole big enough to crawl into and die. I caught up to him at an intersection with a side street. We crossed, stopped a moment, looked at each other in anger, and BURST out laughing. It was a laugh that said \u201cDear God, did that just happen to us?\u201d It was a laugh that said \u201cWe are horrible people.\u201d It was a laugh that said \u201cWe will remember this moment for the rest of our lives.\u201d And we have never forgotten.We also haven\u2019t walked Koda down a busy street ever since\u2026.  Edit: I did have a roll of bags, but the roll was in my purse. I had made the last minute decision to leave my purse in the car because it was so full, and heavy, and I just wanted to take an enjoyable jaunt with my husband and the girls. I didn\u2019t even think about it at the time. Truly my own fault! ",

            "answer_text": "Ahhh i'm laughing typing this just thinking of the story. Only me. Of course it would only happen to me. I'll get right to it\u2026.. Ok so i had met my husband and got pregnant real quick. Like within a month of meeting him. It wasn't a bad thing. We were excited. I wasn't very worldly. I was very naive and beyond modest. Alot of things i really didn't think thru being pregnant so quickly in a relationship. We literally didn't know each other. I had my own appartment but as soon as we knew i was pregnant we had to move in together. I was on cloud nine. Then reality set in. Actually terror set in..Ohh my god what if i have to poop? Pretty girls don't poop. It's a secret. Ok i got this just a small thing i didn't factor in..the mortification that i felt at the thought of having to poop with him in the same house. Nope can't do it. Not gonna do it. And the bathroom was off the living room..it's just a no go. I came up with this genius idiea I'd just say when the urge hit that i had to go to my mothers house for something or she needed to see me. So for about 2 months i kept with it. I visited my mother once a day to use her bathroom. She would die laughing everytime she'd see me pull in the drive way sideways and running up the path to the house. Her house was about 10 min away. She'd yell while i was in the bathroom. \u201c God shannon your pregnant with this man's baby but you can't shit in the same house, what the hell does he think, you don't shit? \u201c i yell from the bathroom \u201c yes mam he think's i'm perfect \u201c he never said anything come to think of it. Then one fateful night the most embarrassing moment of my life happened. Nothing has compared since. I belive my soul died a little bit that night and a huge lesson in humility was had. We had just finnished an amazing dinner that my love had cooked. It was steak with brown gravy and mashed potatoes and green beans. As i sat on the couch i felt a pain in my belly. I think to myself ohh no!! Another pain but worse than the last. The pain was familiar. The pain brought fear of having to poop. Another pain. Ohhh God no there's no time. I felt like a trapped animal. I looked all around in a panic. I weighed could i make it to my moms in time. Is there a McDonald's close. A supermarket bathroom. Under no circumstances would i have considered those options unless i was desperate. I was desperate!! No no what am i gonna do? Cheeks are clenching now. There is no time. The secret will be out. I poop. Yes i poop. This isn't how i pictured the reveal but none the less i excused myself and made my way to the bathroom. Dying inside. Shedding a tear. As if me having to poop wasn't bad enoughf my pregnant body decided to malfunction. As i sat on the pot i felt myself getting so hot and sweaty. The pain was almost to much to take. I was sweating bullets. Next thing i know everything went black. I passed out. The next thing i see is my husband over me trying to move my body so he can get me off the bathroom floor. I wanted to pretend that i was still passed out. I could not process this humiliation. And the smell. I've never smelled anything like it since.. My husband now but my boyfriend of three months who didn't know i pooped i was pretty sure he knew now. I was disgusted with myself. He was standing over me trying to get me upright. I was weak. I felt like i had just been in a fight. As he was trying to help me all the sudden i felt another wave but only this time i had to puke. I tried to swallow it down. My mouth was watering. Ohh please no no noooooo\u2026i erupted like a volcano. That amazing dinner had come back up. He had his shirt off it was summer time. He had me in the threshold door part one foot in the bathroom one foot in the livingroom His prized shag rug was ruined. He had green beans hanging off his chest. Now another round of horrible smells. I wanted to die. I just looked at him pathetically. He took that cue i belive as i had suffered enough. There were no words exchanged. I'm standing there a straight humiliated by this. He lovingly changed me. Cleaned me up. Put me on the couch and i passed out. My senses overloaded and my spirit defeated. When i woke the prized shag rug was gone and the bathroom sparkled with cleanliness. I almost thought it was a dream. Nope it really happend. But guess what i can poop anywhere now!! ",
