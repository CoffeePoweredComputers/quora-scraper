            "answer_text": "As John Bartram and Nicolas Garcia point out, the date of emergence of Christianity is not as clear as most Christians want to believe. Yeshua ben Yusef was a radical rabbit and a pioneer of passive resistance. He taught to the Jews who were his people. Not just theology but resistance techniques such as turning the other cheek and walking another mile. Along with loving your enemies, these ideas seem to have originatde in Hinduism and point to the possibility that Yeshua may have travelled to India, most likely as a journeyman carpenter working his way as a ship\u2019s carpenter. (It is seemingly no accident or whim that led Thomas the Skeptic [or \u201cDoubting Thomas] to set up the church in modern-day Kerala State in India as early as 53AD, as the story has it). Saul (or Paul) of Tarsus created the notion of Jesus (the Greek translation of Yeshua) the Messiah and element of a divine Trinity. That was some time after the death of Yeshua. The Trinity was a core element of the Olympian pantheon, but not of Jewish tradition. Saul/Paul also made a significant break with other followers of Yeshua by teaching to Gentiles and weaving into the religion elements from both Greek and Roman theological traditions. This made it easier to spread through the Empire. In 325 AD Roman Emperor Constantine convened the Council of Nicea, purportedly to bring together the various \u201cChristian\u201d traditions but in reality more to bring them under the control of Rome and to extirpate teachings that were seditious to the Roman Empire. The notion of Jesus as divine was a key element in this establishment of the religion because it needed to key into existing Roman theological frameworks but to replace the deified Emperors with a semi-mythical person deified. It was also important to blame the Jews for the Crucifixion of Jesus, despite its having been done by the Romans, so the story of a Jewish Rabbi was used as an excuse for genocidal attacks on the Jewish people by Christians for more than a millenium. It was towards the end of the Twentieth Century that the leader of the Roman Church finally refuted that idea. As John Bartram points out in this thread, further changes were made over the next century or two that brought \u201cChristianity\u201d to what came to be known as Roman Catholicism after the Reformation. So Christianity would seem to be older than Islam, but possibly not by all that much. However Islam can be seen as a relatively mild reworking of older theological ideas including many that are almost certain to have been part of some of the Pre-Nicean threads of Christianity. We might even see both Islam and Christianity as co-descendants of the teachings of Jesus filtered through different cultures and theological traditions. In that light they might be seen as being of equal age, although that is bound to be a fringe view. ",

            "answer_text": "Islam [ means submission to God ] came first . the first human in this earth was muslim , Prophet Adam peace be upon him . Allah is the God of Prophets Adam , Noah , Abraham , Moses , Jesus and Muhammad peace and blessings be upon them all . same God , same religion ( to worship God alone and not worship any partners with him ) but different laws and languages . Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 13. He prescribed for you the same religion He enjoined upon Noah, and what We inspired to you, and what We enjoined upon Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus: \u201cYou shall uphold the religion, and be not divided therein.\u201d As for the idolaters, what you call them to is outrageous to them. Allah chooses to Himself whom He wills, and He guides to Himself whoever repents. ( 42 : 13 ) Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 135. And they say, \u201cBe Jews or Christians, and you will be guided.\u201d Say, \u201cRather, the religion of Abraham, the Monotheist; he was not an idolater.\u201d 136. Say, \u201cWe believe in Allah; and in what was revealed to us; and in what was revealed to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs; and in what was given to Moses and Jesus; and in what was given to the prophets\u2014from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we surrender.\u201d 137. If they believe in the same as you have believed in, then they have been guided. But if they turn away, then they are in schism. Allah will protect you against them; for He is the Hearer, the Knower. 138. Allah\u2019s coloring. And who gives better coloring than Allah? \u201cAnd we are devoted to Him.\u201d 139. Say, \u201cDo you argue with us about Allah, when He is our Lord and your Lord, and We have our works, and you have your works, and we are sincere to Him?\u201d 140. Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Patriarchs were Jews or Christians? Say, \u201cDo you know better, or Allah?\u201d And who does greater wrong than he who conceals a testimony he has from Allah? Allah is not unaware of what you do. 141. That was a community that has passed. To them is what they have earned, and to you is what you have earned. And you will not be questioned about what they used to do. ( 2 : 135\u2013141 ) .
