            "answer_text": "British Government was ruling on our nation why they need to scared to anyone Specially Gandhi why Gandhi was not fighting against them with weapons his so called weapon was Satya and Ahimsa this bullshit policy is not important when you need to fight against injustice and slavery And many decisions Gandhi took were not beneficial for our country's betterment. Many Gandhi's request and opinions British government declined so Gandhi were not important figure for British government they were cruel ruler why they bother for him and one more thing because of Gandhi only we didn't get independence our freedom fighters and azad hind Sena bring this fruitful results for our country That was congress policy to rule on this country that's why they made Gandhi is father of nation and saint but not at all our great legendary patriots did their hard work for development of our nation. Partition was one of them and giving money to Pakistan was Gandhi's stubborn decision were not beneficial for our country Sorry I am not against Gandhi but I don't believe on his policies and decisions partition and hindu ,and Sikh refugees conditions was not right decision of him and after that situation were very bad and that was the destruction of our nation still we were not living in our akhand bharat And as a hindu our identity sindhu river also not with us so traditionally we were not complete in holy rituals without sindhu river This emptiness was a gift of Gandhi and congress party ",
