            "answer_text": "The main five European markers are: I, E1b1, R1a, R1b and J2. There are also N genetic markers in North East Europe, but they are not of European origin per se. They came with recent (1000\u20131200 years ago) migrations from central Asia and Siberia and are present mostly in Finland and North-West of Russia. Y-Dna I is split in I1 (North) and I2 (South) and they belong to the old proto-European population that lived in Europe long before Caucasian Indo-European migrations of 6400 years ago. Haplogroup I (I1, I2) derives from an even older IJ group of people that migrated to Europe, from South of Caspic Sea (today\u2019s Iran), some 50,000 years ago. They could be the first homo sapiens (Cro-Magnon) that arrived to Europe.  I-M170 is one of the most numerous haplogroups among European males. Subclades can be found in most present-day European populations, with peaks in some Northern European and South East European countries. Consequently, I-M170 represents up to one-fifth of the male population of Europe, being the continent's second major Y-DNA haplogroup (behind Haplogroup R). The haplogroup reaches its maximum frequency in the Balkans (with the highest concentration in present-day Herzegovina). It may be associated with unusually tall males, since those in the Dinaric Alps have been reported to be the tallest in the world, with an average male height of the range 180 cm (5 ft 11 in)-182 cm (6 ft 0 in) in the cantons of Bosnia, 184 cm (6 ft 0 in) in Sarajevo, 182 cm (6 ft 0 in)-186 cm (6 ft 1 in) in the cantons of Herzegovina. (from Wikipedia) E1b1b is also a pre-Caucasian group of genes that came through Anatolia (Turkey today) from Middle East and North Africa. It seems the agriculture was introduced to Europe by E1b1b people:  The newer R1a, R1b and J2 were brought by Caucasians 6400 years ago with their massive migration to Europe. It seems Caucasians (R1a, R1b, J2) stopped for around 1500 years in the so called \u201cOld Europe\u201d area (Balkans, Romania, Hungary, Austria and South-West Ukraine), mixing with the older proto-European populations (I and E1b1b). Conform Kurgan hypothesis, Indo-Europeans migrated in all directions from the Caucasus north region, especially between 4000 BC to 1000 BC. Two main directions were West, towards European continent and East, towards India of today:  The Western branch reached and settled in Central Europe, Carpathian basin and Balkans, by 2500 BC and in West Europe, by 1000 BC. Being at a cross-roads between East European steppes (Ukraine), Pontic area (Turkey and Balkans) , Baltics (Poland, Lithuania) and West Europe (Germany. Austria), Central-South-East Europe territory of today was a migration hub and melting pot of all Caucasians moving back and forth for around 3000 years (between 4000 BC and 1000 BC). If you look at the genetic map of Y-DNA (males, who travelled most) you may find all main European genes of today populations in Europe. Caucasians brought three main genetic groups to Europe: R1a, R1b and J2. J1 is a close marker to J2, even though in less numbers than J2 and will be presented mostly for comparison. West Europeans have as main gene R1b, Celtic. They are the Western branch of Indo-Europeans (Caucasians). Some East-Europeans have similar (15\u201320%) R1b genes proportion to Scandinavians and Central Europeans (Sweden, West Poland, Austria, Czech, Hungary and Balkans):  Hplogroup R1b migrations:  Some East Europeans have more R1a, from the ancient Slavic people. Others have similar proportion (15\u201320%) of R1a genes as Balkan, German and Scandinavian people:  Haplogroup R1a migrations:  A very old Neolithic marker, in a less significant proportion (8\u201315%), present in Central-Soouth-East Europe, such as Hungarian-Romanian-Bulgarian-Serbian population is J2. It can be found in similar numbers in: Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, part of Sweden, Austria, as well. Quite a few ancient Mediterranean and Middle Eastern civilizations flourished in territories where J2 lineages were preponderant. This is the case of the Hattians, the Hurrians, the Etruscans, the Minoans, the Greeks, the Phoenicians (and their Carthaginian offshoot). Interesting is the fact that the highest concentration (30\u201340%) of J2 marker is in Caucasus mountains:  Another very old Y-Dna marker in Europe is Neolithic J1. It comes from the goat herders who were almost certainly not homogenous tribes consisting exclusively of J1 lineages, but in all likelihood a blend of J1 and T1 lineages. So much is evident from the presence of both J1 and T1 in north-east Africa, Middle East, the Caucasus and the mountainous parts of southern Europe. Frequencies of Haplogroup J1 in Europe and West Asia tend to vary considerably from one regional community to the next. The highest local percentages in Europe are found in Greece, plus the Balkans, Italy, France, Spain and Portugal but hardly ever exceeds 5% of the population. However Italy, France and Spain also have areas where J1 appears completely absent. Even in northern Europe, where the nation-wide frequencies are below 0.5%, very localized pockets of J1 have been observed in Scotland, England, Belgium, Germany and Poland. Larger sample sizes are needed to get a clearer picture of the distribution of J1 in Europe. This is a small percentage marker (1\u20135%) in European population and, again, East-European countries have similar numbers, same as West Europe, as well. Distribution of haplogroup J1 in Europe, the Middle East & North Africa  Now, about other older populations of Europe before Kurgan (4500 BC). North and South Europeans have I1-I2: Scandinavian, Sardinian, Dalmatian. I1 and I2 are two close genetic groups representing ancient populations from the North and South of Europe before the Indo-Europeans. They are the ones Indo-Europeans kind of overwhelmed all over Europe, during migrations, 6400 years ago. They are in higher proportion on the extremes North (Scandinavia) and South (Sardinia) of Europe. First let\u2019s take the whole I male DNA marker that represents the male population before the Caucasians migrated to Europe. It seems the highest percentage of over 50% is present in Scandinavia, Sardinia and Dalmatian coast. Interesting though is the Romania, Serbia, Bulgaria, most of Ukraine, parts of Austria and Hungary come a close second, with 30\u201340% of men. These are the men Y-Dna genes that exist in Europe since 10,000 BC or earlier. Distribution map of haplogroup I in Europe  And now, let\u2019s split the I marker of proto-Europeans into the main groups I1 (North) and I2 (South). I1 evolved in isolation in Scandinavia during the late Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods, when hunter-gatherers from southern Europe recolonised the northern half of the continent from their Last Glacial Maximum refugia. I1 (North) earlier people, East-Europeans have low percentage (1\u20132%), similar to French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese etc.:  I2 (M438/P215/S31) is thought to have originated during the Late Paleolithic, around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which lasted approximately from 26,500 to 19,000 years ago. I2 probably appeared in western Europe, although its exact region of origin cannot be determined since Paleolithic Europeans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Haplogroup I2 is the most common paternal lineage in former Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria and Sardinia, with percentage of 15\u201320% also present in Austrians, Hungarians and Ukrainians:  Yeah, these guys:  Other genetic group, South-Mediterranean Europeans have E1b1b, of North African origin. They were early migrations of agricultural and cattle grower people coming through Anatolia, but original from North Africa. Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Etruscans had a strong E1b1b marker. South-East-Europeans have similar proportion (10\u201315%) of E1b1b genes with most West Europeans (same as France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany), most Central Europeans (Czech, Serbia, Croatia, Hungary, Austria) and Ukraine. This is less than South Balkan and South Italian people (they have more, which is normal):  Whilst each area of Europe has only one, or two, main genetic groups, Central-South-East Europe countries have around 15\u201320% of each of the five main branches, in a fairly balanced proportion. Similar genetic proportions exist in the neighbouring countries, such as: Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Moldova, Slovakia and part of Ukraine. On the mother side though, things are even more clear, as women traveled/migrated less in the past; J, U5, HV0, V and K markers (MtDNA) are dominant among Europeans and, again, Central and East Europe have the average percentages of all. Interesting is the 39.2\u201337.2% for H, 10.1\u201310.5% for J and 7.4\u20137.2% for U5, 6.9\u20137.9% for K markers account for around 65% of European MtDNA genome. Distribution of haplogroup J (mtDNA) in Europe:  Distribution of haplogroup U5 (mtDNA) in Europe:  Distribution of haplogroup K (mtDNA) in Europe:  Distribution of haplogroups HV0 and V (mtDNA) in Europe:  It seems female markers are pretty similar all over the continent, with definitely fewer variations than the male ones. That seems logical, as women traveled and moved around very little compared to men, thousands of years ago. Most of those markers are ancient, long before Caucasian migrations; however, that does not mean that Caucasians did not bring similar female (MtDna) markers themselves. Central-South-East Europeans have a more balanced genetic mixture than West European male populations of today (from North, West, South and East). On the female side, East European women are totally similar to any other European women, from any corner of Europe. Look at today\u2019s genetic map of Europe. It reflects the proto-European populations (I1, I2, E1b1b) and the Caucasian invaders of 6400 years ago (R1a, R1b and J2), in over 95% proportion. Some exception is the N genes (Uralo-Finic-Siberian origin), mostly present in some Baltic states and Russia. That shows clearly that whatever migrations happened after 4400 BC were insignificant for population genetics of the Balkan region and Central Europe and account for less than 5% for all combined. :  Today\u2019s predominant one gene:  From all this information (in case you reached this point in your reading) we conclude that European population of today was formed from two main groups of people. The proto European inhabitants prior to the Kurgan hypothesis invasions (6400 ago), with the hploroups I1 (Scandinavia), I2 (Sardinia and Balkans) and E1b1b (Mediterranean). They were there since Paleolithic (I1, I2) and Neolithic (E1b1b). The second group, the Indo-Europeans per se (some call them Caucasians) came later, beginning with 6400 years ago from North of Caucasus and they are bearers of R1a (Slavic), R1b (Celtic) and J2 (South Europeans). The two groups co-existed in the Carpathian basin, lower Danube, and Balkan regions in the so called \u2018Old Europe\u2019, for around 1500 years (see the genetic diversity in those areas). Around 5000 years ago, they split and moved in all directions R1a North-East, R1b West and J2 South and South-West (see more compact genetic markers in those parts of Europe). It is possible that part of the R1a to have been migrated North directly from Caucasus. However the R1b branch did not have any other route towards West Europe than from Carpathian basin. East-Europe could be named geographically. Genetic wise it is too diverse (at the Eruopean level, of course) to be just put into just one category. West-Europe is more compact genetically, with mostly R1b Celtic markers and I1 Scandinavian (Germanic). Of course, the J2 in the south and I2 in Sardinia make some difference. However, undoubtly, the genetic markers afiliations and transitions follow the geographic locations, all throughout Europe. ",
