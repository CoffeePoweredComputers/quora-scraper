            "answer_text": "The \u2018country\u2019 as we now know it as a concept is only a few hundred years old. Now we have so-called \u2018nation\u2019 countries, people belonging to and defending a territory, smaller or bigger. It was not so in 99% of the history of mankind. You defended your home and your village, for your own and for your family\u2019s life and for not being thrown into slavery, but you have not defended a bigger territory. Current countries are constructions of the so-called \u2018sovereignty\u2019, that the Earth is divided into 200 some small pieces and the leaders of them accept that they rule only the territory given to them, plus they accept others to rule their own territory. There is no reason why these are the pieces (some islands are of course natural pieces), and why are they as many as they are. Many of the \u2018nation\u2019 countries based on a single language but this is also not an explicit rule and again from your personal point of view happened by pure accident. You got your language from your parents not from the country where you live. Further, being proud of your country comes many times together with pushing other countries down. Why? Is it sg you are proud of that you elevate the territory where you live above other parts of Earth? So, based on the above, the need to be proud of your country is only the demand of your rulers to protect the territory for them. You can be better proud of the continent, the whole Earth, only your city, only your house if you wish. There is no particular reason to be proud of the country where you live. It is especially wrong to be proud of your country because it is a bigger part of Earth, or exists longer, or have some advanced weaponry. ",

            "answer_text": "Feel proud and love your country like how you love your parents. Your mother and father might not be the richest or strongest people in the world. They may not have the glamorous history other families might have. They may not own a home as big as others do. But you love them because they raised you, nurtured you, gave you familiarity and security. They taught you traditions, they told you stories about those who came before you. That\u2019s why you should love and feel pride for your country. It is a macrocosm of the home you grew up in, and its people are your people. \u2764\ufe0f ",
