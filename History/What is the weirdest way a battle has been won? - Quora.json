            "answer_text": "In 1281, a Mongol army set out to invade Japan. The disparity of numbers in the Mongols\u2019 favour was in the order of 4:1. They tried to storm the beaches but couldn\u2019t breach the defensive walls the Japanese had built after an earlier Mongol assault in 1274. The Mongols reorganized and tried again at several other sites but met the same fate. They retreated to their ships to think over their options. As the fleet lay off the coast, a typhoon blasted out of the East and turned most of the ships to matchsticks. Thousands drowned. The survivors packed up and departed in what was left of their ships. They didn\u2019t try again. The Japanese attributed their salvation to divine intervention. They named the phenomenon the \u201cDivine Wind\u201d or Kamikazi. ",

            "answer_text": "During WWII, a U.S. naval destroyer won a battle against a Japanese submarine by throwing potatoes at them. Yes you read that right. The U.S. navy ship accidentally got in close proximity with the Japanese ship, and while the U.S. were still frantically trying to mount all weapons on deck, someone decided to throw potatoes in a panic. The Japanese, stunned by this and thought the potatoes were grenades, began throwing them back to the destroyer, which then resulted in a massive potato fight. But the destroyer immediately acted up and got some distance away from the Japanese ship while the Japanese were still distracted by the \u201cgrenades\u201d. Within a few minutes the U.S. managed to get out the real weapons and successfully sink the enemy ship.  The power of potatoes. ",
