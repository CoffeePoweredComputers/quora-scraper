            "answer_text": "UO does not manufacture their own furniture. I have my doubts that they design it either... most likely taken out of a factory catalog. There are a couple of ways to determine this in steps. 1. Go to an Urban Outfitters store, or even online, and determine the country of origin. It'll say somewhere on the item or on the shipping box.2. If you see the shipping box you may also find the factory, but more likely you'll find an agent that takes care of the stuff for them.3. Go to the U.S. Customs website and do a search for shipments received by them. The information generally includes the consignor. Generally, Asian factories (if that's where the stuff comes from) don't readily respond to individuals requests, and if they don't speak English may not even respond to a request for information on big orders. In this case you'll need to use an agent too. ",
