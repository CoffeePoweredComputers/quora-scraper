            "answer_text": "You really can\u2019t say that everyone in the world has been reincarnated. There are the \u201cnewbies,\u201d who have to start somewhere. They typically flounder in their first lives. A good life for them in modern times might be as a farmer in a remote location, or a native in one of the jungles, or very remote villages in the world. You typically have 600 to 800 lives on Earth. The lives are divided by three, to young, medium, and old souls, and then subdivided into quadrants. I receive questions from all over the world to ask in my meditative sessions, and I estimate that so far I\u2019ve asked between 20,000 and 25,000 questions since 2005. I just had someone ask me about lives being an illusion, plus more about medium lives, and the percentages of young, medium, and old souls alive on the Earth at the present time. Here is what I received when I asked my Guardian Angel (a Golden Light Being) Theo: Theo, are our lives on Earth an illusion? Not an illusion, but keep in mind that there are twelve parallel lives, each one at a different frequency, with one of those truly non-physical, as has been explained to you in the past. Then you have all the probable lives, which would be considered non-physical, until that probability is chosen, and then it becomes the physical reality. What are the major reasons a medium soul makes steady progress\u2014subconscious experiences, spirituality, accepting reincarnation? And what percentages of young, medium and old souls are there on Earth at the present time? Though you are veiled each time you have a life on Earth, there is a buildup of knowledge that you can access on a subliminal level. We are also allowed to assist you a little more, especially if you are requesting the assistance. Even that knowledge greatly assists in coping with your lives in the medium soul category we\u2019ll call it. You come closer to understanding, even on a subconscious level, what your goals in those lives are, where you might have had no clue in your young soul lives. Regarding the percentages, as we have stated before, because there are so many people alive today, it is all hands on deck. That means almost every one of the souls who volunteered for the Earth Experiment have their soul fragments having lives\u2014even multiple lives, where, as just one example, you have had two lives going on at the same time earlier in your present incarnation. Young souls, including all four quadrants, would be closer to 60 to 65%. Then the medium soul category would be close to 30% and the remaining old soul category is much smaller. These percentages can change a little from year to year. Keep in mind that it takes quite a while for a soul fragment to work through the average number of 600 to 800 lives on Earth in many time periods.

            "answer_text": "Reincarnation is a divine process afforded to all living planetary creatures and governed by stringent rules. It is also a personal choice. Which means, it does not automatically occur, one must apply to the proper divine authorities for permission. Here are some of the rules. We are not limited to reincarnation on Earth, we may elect to reincarnate on any inhabited planet in any willed life forms available. I reiterate willed life form. It is celestially impossible for a willed soul-being such as yourself ever to be born as a non-willed animal. Nor is it possible for a non-willed soul to ever occupy the structure of a willed being. Please let me explain. There are two existing forms within the universe, the immortal soul that never dies and the finite mortal body into which an immortal soul may choose to occupy. As for the mortals on this planet, there are two types, willed creatures such as man, whales, and dolphins, and non-willed creatures such as all animals, insects, and plants. Yes, you heard me correctly; all living things possess an immortal soul. Now, what is the difference between a willed and non-willed creature? When life begins upon any universally developing worlds such as earth, it undergoes an evolutionary process from the atavism of self-preservation to survival of the fittest. From the myriads of developing life-forms, there will eventually come individuals who show a willingness to make moral decisions by sacrificing itself to protect another of its kind. That species is divinely identified as willed beings because one of them willingly chose to preserve their species. As mentioned above, three such species met that criteria here on earth.------------------------------------------------------------------------ I realize that when you posted your question on Quora, you did not expect an answer from a Melchizedek teacher. I am a spiritual realist, not a Bible-thumping religious fanatic, and sharing divine information is what I do. Jesus is the creator of this planet, and I have been working on his behalf for eons, so this information may be complex and challenging and could require some time to be fully understood.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- If you would like to learn more above and beyond the subject of your question, I invite you to visit my website. The first bit of divine knowledge you should is the basic process of where everything began. Read or listen to Dalamatia, and then From Whence We Came. The first pertains to personal guardians of all willed beings, where she explains what one must do to be born on this planet. The second covers non-willed guardians of all the remaining life forms on Earth. As a special gift to expand your divine knowledge, I will provide everything you need to know about Death and Dying as supplied to us by our spiritual advisor, a personal friend, and Master Melchizedek teacher Abaris. Jesus told us that within his father\u2019s house, there were many mansions, so let me begin by sharing some divine knowledge about how planets, solar systems, and galaxies come into existence by listening to a Creator Son who has already created some. Whether or not you believe in reincarnation makes little difference because it is real, and I will prove it. Now that you know who creates planets let me share my personal experience of delivering the Life Pods to this planet. Since we are not alone in this vast universe. I will acquaint you with the home-world of our brothers and sisters of the Pleiades, which is also the home of the Brotherhood Fleet that delivered the life pods. Here is a final gift from Abaris on what to expect in the not too distant future. Realize Abaris recorded this message back in June of 1995; (24 years ago), so some of the predictions have already come to pass while others are yet to occur. When talking with us, he often used universal time, which is 18.34 times greater than earth time; thus, predictions he slated to occur in one or two years actually mean nearly twenty to forty earth years. I am not a dooms-dayer, I am a spiritual realist, but that puts the remainder of the predictions in our present and future, and if you have been paying attention to our present-day weather patterns, the rain, flooding, and tornadoes are just beginning. You should also keep an eye on global politics that are pushing us toward WW3, So, it is past time to prepare for the survival of you and yours! ",

            "answer_text": "Reincarnation is an essential part of growth and evolution; and it has been taking place and is still taking place in every life form from the beginning of creation. Reincarnation means a soul that has entered a body after it has discarded its last one. There are two types of reincarnation; (1) Micro Reincarnation (2) Macro reincarnation. In the former, that is, micro reincarnation, an individual changes forms a number of times within a lifetime. As for example a human infant is more like an animal (1)in its first stage of existence, when it can neither walk,nor talk. (2) In the next stage, that is the Baby stage, it can walk and talk and recognize many things and memorize many things,and store a lot of information in its brain. (3) In the third stage it is an adolescent when it has changed its form again and its main activity is the development of the intellect when it collects and stores a lot of information and its personality is completely different from its former existence. Also it has matured emotionally and its reaction to situations is different. (4) In the fourth stage that is when it is an adult, there is no more significant changes in body parts; and development is centered on growth in dimensions. The intellect is still growing,and the emotional reactions are more balanced as it has learnt to observe cause and effect in its interactions with other life- forms. The adult incarnation in an individual reaches a peak, and then on, the graph moves downwards when old age sets in, as time for macro reincarnation approaches. The macro reincarnation takes place when the individual has to finally discard its body altogether, and that is when death takes place. Death is the withdrawal of the soul from the body. After death, the body disintegrates into the elements from which it is made. Then the soul goes to the astral world which has seven provinces to it. Soul cannot just dissolve into space as the soul is an evolving unit of life and is different from life that is everywhere in the universe. Now the question is do all souls start from the first province. The answer is no. In the first three provinces which are nearest to the earth, only souls that have a lot of negative energy in them like more than 80% negative energy, go there where they meet other wicked souls like themselves, who prevent them from going upwards and they take centuries to reincarnate. It is by repeated reincarnations that the individual can finally reach province no.7 of the astral world, from where the souls have to go for their final judgment. If they pass the final judgment there is no more death and no more reincarnation. The traits for which the final judgment is made are (1) Extent of Consciousness (2) Extent of Awareness (3) Extent of Knowledge (4) Extent of Wisdom ( 5) Extent of Sensitivity. Souls that have not made the grade have to go back to earth and have further reincarnations. But souls that have made the grade are taken into the first province of heaven where they have to undergo further training to live and function as spirits. There are four such provinces in heaven. It is from the fourth province that God functions ; and very few reach there. In the third province there are godlike souls from where God sends out from time to time religious teachers, prophets, incarnations etc where ever in the world they are required. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, all living beings reincarnate, from atoms, molecules, cells to organs, plants, animals, humans, planets etc. We are eternal beings on a never-ending journey through spiritual and physical planes. When our physical body becomes useless due to injury, illness or old age, then the spirit pulls out. Our spirit is who we really are - we are NOT identical to our physical body. The body is just an instrument for the spirit. When the spirit pulls out it is attracted to a wavelength in the spiritual world that corresponds to its own wavelength\u2026 the law of attraction sees to that. The spirit then has a good long rest on the spiritual plane until it is again ready to go back to the psychical plane to get on with its development. It then reincarnates at the moment of conception and it creates a new physical body in its own favor.

In the thousands of cases I\u2019ve examined, everyone claims that they chose to be here, everyone claims that we can choose not to come here if we don\u2019t want to, but that everyone who does come here does so willingly (at least until they get here and think \u201cwhat was I thinking?\u201d) ",

No mortal is left without a spirit to guide and protect them, and, as spirits require about 80 to 120 lifetimes to learn the lessons of the spirit world most people would have had a number of previous incarnations. New spirits are continuously being created. They then spend the equivalent of a decade or two in the spirit world before their first incarnation. They return to the spirit world between each lifetime, the most common length of time between incarnations being five or six decades.

            "answer_text": "The concept of reincarnation in Hinduism is a warning that we cannot get away with the evil we do in this life but could be re-born as animals or suffer in next life. That could be a wisdom before prophets have received the revelations and taught that there is an afterlife, rewards for good deeds, and punishment for evil actions. The teachings of Karma also exist in other religions that teach blessings for good deeds and curses for bad actions. Prophets of Judaism, Christianity and Islam did not teach anything about past-lives or reincarnation. There is no such thing as nonexistence; death is the end of the temporary testing stage How could those who believe in reincarnation explain population growth? When we see birth defects or children starving to death, we cannot accept the reincarnation teachings that the children who are suffering were sinful in their previous lives. God has told us that we are born fresh without any previous knowledge; those who claim to remember previous lives must be mistaken. According to the teachings of Christianity and Islam, we will be judged in the afterlife according to our deeds in this life. Reincarnation was a wise answer about the issue of suffering; here is the general answer as taught by prophets: We are here for testing; test environment necessitates struggle between good and evil. Testing missions are not supposed to be easy and comfortable. The test questions are not supposed to be known in advance. The wealthy father has the right to test his sons before distributing the wealth The wise father disciplines his children and prepares them for a better life The obedient son who takes care of others should be rewarded better than the disobedient son who persecutes others. Regardless of how successful we are with our personal objectives; we cannot have inner peace without addressing the high-level objective; the purpose of our existence. It is wrong to say \u2018let us enjoy the journey and forget about the destination\u2019 If you find yourself in a train, you should not enjoy the beautiful scenes before first ask: why am I here? Where is the destination? We should first ask \u2018what is the purpose of life?\u2019 What is the value of life if we do not know the purpose of that life? It is the greatest good for an individual to discuss virtue every day... for the un-examined life is not worth living \u2013 Socrates Our life on earth is a very short period compared to the universe time scale; It could be a temporary test period. There are hundreds of verses and teachings about that as mentioned in the following answer: https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-know-our-purpose-of-existence-in-this-world/answer/Sabri-Shahin We have been asked to believe in God and Heaven but we have not seen God or heaven. Our fate will be determined based on that belief and on our good deeds. Why did God make it a difficult test for us? Although God knows what\u2019s in our hearts and what each of us might do, he tests us and wants us to witness our own test results in order to admit that we have been fairly rewarded according to our achievements as recorded in the test results Before the wealthy father distributes his wealth, he may want to record which son is obedient, the records are not for the father who knows, but as a testimony for people who might question the justice of their father Although the wise teacher knows the hard-working student and the lazy student, he prepares regular exams as testimonies so that the students would not say that the teacher had favored some students over the others. Exams also urge students to get prepared in order to succeed Students should not wonder about the intention of the teacher; they are supposed to focus on what the teacher asked them to do If God wants to set up the testing environment to test people, then we are not supposed to advise God on how to set up the terms and conditions of the testing. The students are not supposed to advise the teacher on how to prepare the exams. God has created us, and he knows how to test us. The testing questions and answers are not supposed to be disclosed before the exam; testing environment necessitates some doubts and enables different choices and different decisions. The test does not depend on the level of education, a child may say \u2018I do not see the plane any more, it is going far away, it is still there but my sight does not reach it; God must be there but my sight does not reach him\u2019, but a scientist might conclude that, \u2018I do not see God, then there is no God\u2019. The test does not depend on the level of religion education, maybe someone who never heard of the religion teachings could pass the test based on the natural original gifts of conscience and reason \u2018What I do not want done to myself, I will not do to others. We may find some scholars who know the religion teachings but they accept to persecute and torture others, those are the bad trees which the prophets have warned us of them and of their bad fruits. The wise teacher sets different evaluation criteria for different grades; the students in the first grade are not evaluated as the students in the advanced degrees. We expect that the fair and wise God would evaluate people according to what they have been provided. The person who never heard of Prophets would have an easier test based on the gift of intelligence and conscience; he might get rewards for his good works and he might not be punished if not wicked. God has empowered each of us to be happy and blessed. God does not predetermine plans for us. God has delegated that task to us, it is up to us to be blessed or to be cursed. The message that God has revealed to all prophets is: \u2018Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. \u201cIn obedience and repentance is your salvation\u201d Isaiah 30:15 Based on the above, the obedient believer should be blessed in this life and should be saved in the afterlife. That is the truth which should set you free. For those who have doubts, they can ask God. All prophets have urged us to ask God and taught that God would answer us. Do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us.
