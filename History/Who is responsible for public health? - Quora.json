Responsible for health living, learning first aid, defibrillators, and so on. Many countries have health services (e.g. Hospitals) which support us, but they only act once we are ill. ",

            "answer_text": "Society can take certain steps to improve public health status. Making sure the water supply is free of disease, ensuring adequate vaccination to prevent outbreaks/ epidemics, monitoring food for contaminants, ensuring that medical treatments are sufficiently researched for safety come to mind. Monitoring disease patterns and correlates as the CDC does also helps. But, beyond the relatively little that society can do the individual has final responsibility for making good or poor choices in regards to health status - not smoking, using alcohol sparingly, avoiding obesity, taking care to not contract diseases that require bodily contact (HIV, TB, syphilis, etc) come to mind.
