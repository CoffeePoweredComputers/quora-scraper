            "answer_text": "Disease is everywhere - nature is rarely sterile! And the battlefield isn\u2019t where you want to be worried - it\u2019s your camp that\u2019s more likely to kill you. To put into numbers what you stated; during the Crimean war of 1853\u201356, 753 000 troops died on both sides. Of these, 495 000 died of disease (~62%).  But to get to your point, there\u2019s a good number of reasons why, up until the First World War, disease was always a bigger killer than bullets: Hygiene - Or why people get the diseasesPut anyone large group close together for enough time and disease will spread if nothing is done to stop it. This was recognised famously by Florence Nightingale during the Crimean war, a pioneering nurse who herself is thought to have succumbed to the long term consequences of infectious disease (Brucellosis, or Crimea fever):  One of Florence Nightingale\u2019s charts illustrating causes of death during the Crimean war. Plenty of diseases can run rife amongst large concentrations of people. Just a few members of the rogues gallery include: Dysentery (and other Diarrheal diseases) With large numbers of people come large amounts of faeces and urine. Put ten thousand men in a temporary camp with no modern conveniences like flushing toilets, without understanding of things like washing hands when preparing food, and with water sources being close/the same as waste disposal\u2026 vomiting and diarrhoea spread fast. Be it Shigella, Cholera, Rotavirus, Amoeba, all can cause severe dehydration, and death. Campaigns before the modern were often stopped in their tracks or crippled by the \u201cbloody flux\u201d, as dysentery was called. 95000 Union soldiers during the US Civil war died from dysentery alone. King Henry V, Saint Louis IX and King John all died from dysentery caught whilst on military campaign. Such as issue is it that modern military force protection goes to great lengths to prevent disease, with extensive teaching on hand and personal hygiene, appropriate latrine placement on camps, and contingencies for preventative antibiotics. And yet we still see devestating outbreaks in refugee camps. During the Rwandan genocide and wars, some camps saw up to 32% of residents afflicted by dysentery, with a 3.8% death rate. Imagine that on campaign - a camp of 10000 troops seeing 380 troops (the best part of a battalion) killed outright, and nearly a third of the force fighting at reduced capacity due to their illness.  Probably appropriate. Influenza Coughs and sneezes spread diseases. But our ancestors didn\u2019t know that. Thousands of people sleeping in close proximity sees respiratory diseases such as the flu spread like crazy. See the Spanish Flu. These days, appropriate accommodation, disease surveillance, and vaccination all contribute to reduced rates of flu.  Influenza sufferers in a US camp  The sheer rate of influenza amongst military personnel of the US army. Typhus Back in the day, military conditions on campaign were hardly luxurious, and personal hygiene took a lesser priority to more basic aspects of survival, such as eating and drinking. Thus people tended to end up afflicted by body lice, and by fleas when living in close proximity with animals on campaign. And with lice and flea comes Typhus, a bacterial infection causing high fevers, rash, and death. Look to the Nazi camps for an insight into the horror of Typhus, which sadly took the lives of thousands, including Anne Frank. These days, we don\u2019t see body lice - good hygiene, and fumigation, insecticide and other such controls, prevent these diseases from spreading like they did.  Malaria/Yellow Fever Tens of thousands of people have been killed by these diseases during peace time campaigns. Over 12 000 workers died building the Panama railway, from Yellow Fever alone. Modern anti-malarials, mosquito nets, insecticide and vaccines have all but eliminated these from the military forces.   Treatment - Or how we deal with people once illness sets in.People forget in our modern age what it used to be like. We are truly privileged that the works of our forebears have allowed us to live without the scourge of infection. So let us go back to that world. In 1812, when Napoleon marched on Russia, and encountered what would be his undoing, medical science was nothing like we have now. No antibiotics at all - just herbal remedies and other such weird and wonderful cures. Syphilis was famously treated with Mercury. Germ theory was an oddball theory, sidelined by the miasma theory (that bad smells and air caused infectious disease). It would be another 50 years till Pasteur\u2019s groundbreaking work started to be widely recognised. What chance did you have, cold, malnourished, and exhausted, in fighting off a lethal infection? Say you made it to battle, and a lump of shot found its way into your leg, or a sabre slashed your arm? If that wound became infected, you had but a couple choices - chance gangrene and near guaranteed fatality, or chance a battlefield amputation (which was by no means a safe procedure). Antibiotics, even appropriate wound care, had yet to be discovered. And so if you were wounded, there\u2019s a good chance that infection from that wound would kill you.  So in summary, disease is everywhere. Before we developed hygiene and modern medicine, concentration of people meant concentration of disease, and thus vast numbers of deaths from said diseases. Thankfully we have moved on, and all benefit. Hope that answers! ",

            "answer_text": "During the period before and during the civil war \u201cdoctors\u201d and \u201csurgeons\u201d had little to no training in surgery and amputations. In Europe there were already 4 year medical schools, but in the US most trained as apprentices or went to a 2 year medical school. For instance Harvard University didn\u2019t even own a stethoscope until after the Civil War. Probably the more important thing to note is that along with the lack of experience and training, there was no knowledge of cross contamination, the spread of bacteria, infection, or sterilization. The surgeons would use the same amputation saw or sponge on multiple patients; the practice of washing hands between surgery was not yet commonplace, they would operate in the same blood soaked clothes all day and night, and if a surgical instrument dropped on the floor it was simply rinsed off in a basin of cold water and used again. Therefore infection and necrosis were rampant in the makeshift field hospitals causing an 83% mortality rate. The other top cause of death on the battlefield was disease: typhoid, malaria, dysentery, and pneumonia. The reason these disease were such killers during the Civil War was from two reasons: lack of knowledge of the importance of sanitation practices and drinking contaminated water. It wasn\u2019t until after the war that research started to come about on how disinfecting tools and hands, as well as cross contamination, and clean water would have prevented a huge loss of life.
