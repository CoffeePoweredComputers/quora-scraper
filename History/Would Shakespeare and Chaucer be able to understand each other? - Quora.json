            "answer_text": "I suspect they would have a little difficulty understanding one another. Shakespeare\u2019s plays might not appear to be in modern English, but they are. His English is stylized, but essentially it is much the same as the English we speak today. Chaucer, on the other hand, wrote and spoke in Middle English, the language of Britain from about 1100 until around 1500. Here are the opening lines of Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales: WHAN that Aprille with his shoures soote 1 The droghte 2 of Marche hath perced to the roote, And bathed every veyne in swich licour, Of which vertu engendred is the flour; Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth Inspired hath in every holt 4 and heeth The tendre croppes, 5 and the yonge sonne Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-ronne, And smale fowles maken melodye, That slepen al the night with open ye, (So priketh hem nature in hir corages: Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages, And palmers for to seken straunge strondes, To ferne halwes, 9 couthe 10 in sondry londes; And specially, from every shires ende Of Engelond, to Caunterbury they wende\u2026 As you can see, Middle English does offer many of the same familiar words as modern English, but differences abound, so just how much trouble the two British authors would have had in conversation is hard to gauge. Even taking the language differences that matter into account, I suspect two such masters of language would have found a way to understand each other, and no doubt Shakespeare was familiar with Chaucer\u2019s works, which would likely make it somewhat simpler for him to understand Chaucer than it might have been for Chaucer to understand Shakespeare.

            "answer_text": "A real linguist could probably give a definitive answer with mathematical models of drift. But the gap between Shakespeare and Chaucer is about the same as the gap between Shakespeare and us, give or take a century. There\u2019s reason to believe Shakespeare read Chaucer (it\u2019s a long-running argument). We can follow Elizabethan speech/writing today, partly because we\u2019ve worked at understanding Shakespeare the whole time since he died. My guess would be that Chaucer would sound very old fashioned, but not incomprehensible, to Shakespeare. And that if Shakespeare pitched his speech that way, Chaucer would understand him mostly. It would take 10\u201315 minutes to settle that much. Then they\u2019d be chatting like old friends. When one party is the greatest writer ever to write in English \u2014 he invented English as we know it (not without help, but him first) \u2014 and the other party is William Shakespeare, you\u2019d better believe they\u2019d work it out.
