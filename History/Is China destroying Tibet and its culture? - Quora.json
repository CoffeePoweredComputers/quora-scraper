            "answer_text": "Absolutely yes Tibet has been illegally occupied with vast loss of Tibetan life. There is a massive influx of Han immigrants as part of a deliberate and orchestrated government plan to colonise Tibet. Tibet has a very strategic location and massive mineral and woodland resources. Most importantly it is the source of water for half of Asia and this will be of vital importance to china in the coming century. It is a land grab plain and simple Tibetan religious and cultural freedom are suppressed. The legal and business language is now Mandarin which excludes many Tibetans. Towns have gradually been taken over by Han and almost all shops in Lhasa are now Han owned and this is true even in the villages. Tibetans are now second class economic and cultural citizens in their own country. Anyone who dissents faces jail time merely for expressing political sentiments at odds with the CCP. CCP constantly interferes with religious practices and even in the most ludicrous double standard it as an atheist body tries to dictate the reincarnation of lamas. Monks are constantly harassed and religious practices interfered with. Sure China pumps in some aid but mostly it benefits Han and is nothing compared to what China sucks out. Tibetan students have a lower grade requirement - something the wu mao dang also make much off - but only the well educated and politically groomed from pro CCP Tibetans collaborators will get in. Mostly Tibetans have poor healthcare and education. China was also a slavery society before it modernised as were Nepal and Bhutan but the latter modernised without the rather patronising claims of assistance made by the Chinese. It is almost impossible for normal Tibetans to travel abroad as Han do. In summary. China is unequivocally destroying Tibet's culture to ensure it can never leave the Chinese imperialist clutches and this is indeed a well orchestrated campaign at the highest levels. ",

            "answer_text": "I travelled Tibet when I was 17 and I loved there. It was good experience, friendly locals, kids liked to ask for money. They could say \u201c money\u201d in different languages. I asked one lady where was the icecream shop, she couldn\u2019t understand me well, so a lot of her friends came to help me, showed me the direction. Super nice! So in general, I think we liked each other, I was 17 years-old travelling alone there, felt quite safe and I didn\u2019t meet any trouble. There are a lot more tourists in Tibet now, so I\u2019m sure the things are changing, some old buildings are being demolished, more shops, roads, bridges are being built. I know many people have interest in Tibet, recently there is an exhibition about Tibetan history and culture held in Beijing\u2019s Capital Museum. It attracts many visitors\u2026     (pictures are from \u201cTibetan History and Culture exhibition held in Beijing\u201d link: http://english.cctv.com/2018/04/04/PHOAwj9qll8jhCxn8ZAGP3KV180404.shtml#g=http%3A%2F%2Fenglish.cctv.com%2F2018%2F04%2F04%2FPHOAwj9qll8jhCxn8ZAGP3KV180404.xml&p=PHOTEZAbZtj4kANSUz9EBrTN180404 ) I think many people are curious about Tibet, you don\u2019t really see many Tibetans in other Chinese cities, so somehow it\u2019s still a \u201cmysterious\u201d place for many people. I\u2019ve tried to keep my information about Tibet updated. For example, I went to Thangka Exhibition held in Cultural Palace of Nationalities in Beijing. http://english.cctv.com/2017/09/04/PHOAvZTLkSrkHlO2BYdisIcr170904.shtml#g=http%3A%2F%2Fenglish.cctv.com%2F2017%2F09%2F04%2FPHOAvZTLkSrkHlO2BYdisIcr170904.xml&p=PHOTz96gsD0QyUZxTUbeuQYA170904 I met a number of Tibetan artists in the event and had a good conversation with them, from what they told me, they felt happy to promote Tibetan art in Beijing and for them, the chance was great. I hope there will be more exhibitions about Tibetan culture in the future, so people from different culture backgrounds can understand each other better. :) ",
