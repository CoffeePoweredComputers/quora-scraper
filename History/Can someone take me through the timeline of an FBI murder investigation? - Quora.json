            "answer_text": "In part the answer depends upon when it is found that a particular killing is likely to be the work of a serial killer. Everything starts in the hands of local law enforcement until such time as the FBI is actually called and invited in. It also depends on the size of the department that is investigating. If it is a small town and they determine basically from the get go, the FBI may likely send out their evidence team to help collect. I am not sure what would happen in a large city under these circumstances but I am still betting that FBI ERT gets there to do the work. If the serial killer angle is discovered later say at autopsy then that would be where the FBI starts and they then get all their info based on the work already done by the local law enforcement. Unfortunately I have no knowledge that would be helpful of the actual investigation process. I can however offer some help into evidence collection and the process of securing a crime scene should you need details about that.    ",
