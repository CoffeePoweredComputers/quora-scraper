            "answer_text": "Custom in Britain has always been to \"retire\" regnal names of Kings that were disagreeable. There were a couple of Henrys not long after Henry VIII who were in line for the throne, but they both died before they got there. They were sons of James I (England) and VI (Scotland) and Charles I. In modern times, it's unlikely that a Prince of Wales or presumptive Prince of Wales would get the name Henry. Most people realize today just what a terrible ruler Henry VIII was, and there's no real urge to revive that legacy with a presumptive Henry IX. Henry has been given to male children who aren't in line for the throne on many occasions, though. It's Prince Harry's given name (Henry Charles Albert David), just for one, but Harry was never higher than third in the line of succession; he's now fifth. Henry isn't the only name to be blacklisted. There's never been another King John after the only one who had that name was such a poor monarch in the 13th century. The name Charles was never reused after Charles II; his father was perceived as a tyrant (with some justification, actually) and judicially murdered, and even after the Restoration, his son was scandalous. If the current Prince of Wales ever becomes King, he will presumably be Charles III and finally end the blacklisting of that name. He at one time considered taking the regnal name George VII, but he's been known to the world as Charles for so long that he would probably reign as Charles III. (The current Prince George, first-born son of Prince William and his wife Catherine, will probably be George VII someday.) On the other hand, there are a few occasions in British history where a name has been retired over a long period of time for just the opposite reason--because the last ruler who used it was so revered. One example is the name Albert. Queen Victoria's King Consort, Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, has never had his name reused by a future monarch. Her son and successor, Albert Edward, was intended to rule under his full name, but instead chose to be known as Edward VII, because he believed his father's name should stand alone among the rulers of his country. Thirty-five years later, Prince Albert, first in line after the just abdicated Edward VIII, chose the regnal name George VI rather than take the name King Albert, in deference to the wishes of his grandfather. The name Elizabeth was the same for more than 300 years; when Elizabeth II inherited the throne in 1952, she had to basically insist on ruling under her given name, because Elizabeth I was one of the most beloved English monarchs and had been the only Queen regnant under that name since 1603. No one minds now, since she's done the name justice. ",

            "answer_text": "Because James I and VI's elder son Henry Frederick Stuart, Prince of Wales, who would have succeeded his father and reigned as Henry IX, instead died of typhoid fever at the age of 18.    Henry, Prince of Wales, c 1610 Henry was quick-witted, athletic, wildly popular, devoutly Protestant and interested in matters of leadership and government. Instead we got Charles I, James' younger son, who was sickly, intransigent, consistently unpopular, backed anti-Calvinist factions and married a Catholic. That didn't go so well...  We've never really got around to another Henry. Charles I's own third son (after Charles II and James II and VII) was named Henry, Duke of Gloucester but died of smallpox aged 20 just after the Restoration.    Henry, Duke of Gloucester, c 1653 William IV's second illegitimate son was Henry FitzClarence, who died aged 22 before his father even ascended the throne (and owing to his illegitimacy he was never in line to the throne anyway). [He also appears to have died before anyone got around to painting his portrait, so you'll have to imagine him here] (I'm beginning to wonder whether the name came to be seen as a bit of a jinx...) And George V's third son was Prince Henry (also later the Duke of Gloucester) who bucked the trend of royal Henrys by living to the ripe old age of 74.   Henry, Duke of Gloucester , c 1945 It's just not been a name given to the eldest son since 1594. ",
