            "answer_text": "If we compare the geographical distributions of Haplogroup Q and its only sibling, Haplogroup R, there seems to be a \u201cyin and yang\u201d effect: while they are mostly distinct, each area has a bit of the other haplogroup.  That is, Q has an huge range but predominantly spread north and east (in this case, Native Americans moving across Bering Strait into the Americas) whereas R went predominantly west and south (i.e. there is something of a parallel with the Indo-European languages). Nevertheless, in both cases there is significant overlap. The inverse of the hotspot of Q subclades in Scandinavia \u2013 as counterintuitive as this may seem \u2013are Native American cases of Haplogroup R that are rare subclades of \u201cNorth Asian R\u201d rather than European.  Haplogroup R among Native American populations. The highest concentration is among peoples south-west of Hudson Bay in Canada. (Image source: Malhi et al, 2008) Some of this overlap can undoubtedly be explained by well-known historical phenomena, such as medieval migrations into Europe by Uralic, Turkic, and Mongolian speaking steppe peoples and, the modern colonisation of the Americas. However, there are a lot of anomalies. The Finns and Sami, both of whom are relatively \u201clate\u201d arrivals in eastern and northern Scandinavia, are more strongly associated with Haplogroup N and have never had a notable presence in southern Sweden/Norway \u2013 the main location of Haplogroup Q in Europe.Groups more often associated with Q, like the Huns, Avars, Bulgars, Turks, Magyars and Mongols, are only documented as settling in central Europe (although there is limited archaeological evidence of contact between the Huns and south-west Norway)It\u2019s unlikely that Vikings took enough slaves back to Scandinavia to cause such an effect.Furthermore, the Q in Europe differs from region to region \u2013 often in intricately derived subclades that suggest it is much older than the medieval migrants.Similarly, that Native American Haplogroup R is not concentrated in areas of North America where Europeans settled mostly intensively \u2013 it is concentrated among speakers of the Algic languages in north central Canada.   Heat maps of population density in Canada and the US in 1920\u201321, closely matching patterns of Western European settlement. (Image sources: Natural Resources Canada; Geographic Resources Center, University of Missouri.) In other words, it seems that where one finds R, one finds minute traces of Q, perhaps equally ancient traces \u2013 and vice versa. I hesitate to draw precise conclusions, but I am leaning towards the suggestion that after Q and R emerged from their \u201cparent\u201d Haplogroup P1, they hung out together for some time in Siberia (40\u201350,000 years ago) and did not separate sharply: there were Q lineages among the tribes who eventually went west and south; there were R lineages among those who went into North America.

            "answer_text": " Map provided in question comment (previously question details) Well, I doubt there\u2019s an explanation that can be proven conclusively. Experts in fields of history, anthropology, ethnic studies, and genetics all have their own educated guesses. My own theory would hinge on the gradient of the group across Siberia. Notice how the frequency gets greater and greater as you get further east? That could be explained by paleolithic peoples migrating across Siberia. Some continued on into the Americas, and the bridge subsequently melted. Thus virtually all natives of the Americas are descendants of these people, explaining the nearly uniform saturation of the haplogroup in the New World. Not all of these stone age people went to America, though; some stayed behind, with increasing frequency the further they traveled. How then do we explain the other areas of concentration, particularly those in Scandinavia? I would say that the \u201coriginal\u201d settlement of people with the haplogroup were from the saturated area in western/central Siberia. Something happened to cause them to migrate. Most went east, but some went west, not finding hospitable land and so continuing until they reached the ocean in modern Scandinavia, where they settled. Similar migrations would explain other patches of concentration. Interestingly the Hungarian language as well as Hungarian DNA has ties to western Siberia. ",
