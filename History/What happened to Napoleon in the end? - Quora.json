            "answer_text": "The autopsy of Napoleon revealed an ulcerous lesion at the opening of the stomach into the duodenum. This was described as a cancerous lesion, and was accompanied by a perforation of the stomach wall on its posterior surface. There was no evidence of peritonitis and this perforation was tightly sealed off from the peritoneal cavity. There are other aspects described in the autopsy, that are important for complete understanding of the cause of death. The conclusion of the physicians present at the time of the autopsy was that Napoleon had died of cancer of the stomach. However they described the body as not being emaciated, but actually obese. For instance there is a measurement of the thickness of the fat pad over the sternum being one and a half inches thick. This certainly means Napoleon was well fed. For the last five to six years he had been living a very sedentary life forced on him by his captivity under the English. When a person dies of cancer of the stomach, the mechanism of death is secondary to inability to pass food through the obstruction of the stomach leading to sever malnutrition and emaciation of the body. If this is not the mechanism, then some complication of the cancer must be present such as infection or metastasis to a major organ with failure of that organ, to account for the death. No such secondary complication to account for the death is described in the autopsy. There is another theory prevalent to account for the death of a fifty one year old male who had been a vigorous military commander all his adult life, and now was in the hands of his most vicious enemy. That theory is that he was murdered by that enemy. At this point I would like to refer you to the book written by Ben Weider and David Hapgood, \" The Murder of Napoleon \". This work was preceded by one written by Sten Forshufvud and Ben Weider. The theory developed in these books is that Napoleon was murdered by repeated small doses of arsenic that were administrated most likely in his wine at meal time by one of his own party most likely Charles Montholon. Montholon;s wife is reported to be Napol\u00e9on's mistress during the exile on St Helena. There is a record in the memories of Gaspard Gourgaud that he and Napoleon were visiting Madame Montholon at the time of the birth of a daughter while on St. Helena, when they found her reading a book that described the murder of multiple people during the mid 1600;s by Madame de Brinvillers. This was a celebrated murder case where Madame de Brinvillers used small repetitive doses of arsenic given at variable lengths of time to achieve the death of the victims. This book gave an exact description of how to achieve this outcome in the confession of Madame de Beinvillers contained in the book. It was the suspicion of Sten Forshufyud which was raised during his reading the multiple accounts of people living in exile with Napoleon at St Helena which resulted in the investigations described in the above books, and much more logically the death of Napoleon than the conclusion drawn at the end of the autopsy described earlier. Much of the evidence is based on spectrophotometry of hair samples given by Napoleon to visitors while he was in exile. These locks of hair have been handed down in the families of the recipient and the exact date they received the gift from Napoleon is well documented. Even if the hair sample was sold the exact date of the sale and who sold the hair is well recorded and the date they visited St. Helena can be found. It is the precis correlation of the rise and fall of the arsenic level in the various hair samples over the period of his incarceration on St. Helena with the variable state of his health described in the multiple journals kept by various people that gives stark reality to the suspicion that he was murdered, and that the murder was carried out by repeated small doses of Arsenic. The author's also bring out the state of medicine at the time would contribute to his death. It must be remembered that purging and bleeding were in vogue as well as various concoctions of fluids and physical depressants when added to the arsenic would result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances accelerating the effect of the poison. One other important factor is brought ut by the authors, and that is the fact that arsenic is a preservative of human tissue. When Napoleon was exhumed in 1840 many of those that had accompanied him into exile were present. They had all aged, but Napoleons body was very well preserved. It must be remembered that the English commander on St Helena demanded that the burial proceed very quickly after thew completion of the autopsy. This occurred so rapidly that the body was not embalmed prior to being placed in the grave. All in all if you read this account of Napoleons stay on St. Helena you will surely agree that muder must be high on the list of possible causes of death. ",

            "answer_text": " Napoleon lost a battle. His enemies cornered him and put him in a situation where if he ran and got caught, he\u2019d become a prisoner. If he went back to the troops willing to fight for him (and the sovereignty of France) he\u2019d get them killed to no advantage so he gave himself up to the English government. They said they\u2019d let him go to America. Once he was on one of their ships - against all the laws - they declared him a prisoner. Then that government with the help of their friends slowly tortured and murdered him. That\u2019s his version. I\u2019m broadcasting his memoirs at this time. The memoirs so far are available here.
