            "answer_text": "Let's go the end of World War II. There are now two major superpowers on the earth: the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States is a leader of the \"free world\", or more appropriately, since a lot of the nations in the third world are dictatorships, the non-Communist nations. and the Soviet Union is the leader of the Communist bloc. And, in Indochina (Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) is Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh. In the mid-1860s, the French started their conquest of independent Indochina. Almost immediately, the Vietnamese and other ethnic groups in Indochina start to resist. In the 1920s, the Communists enter the fray backed by the Comintern. Among the leaders of this new party are Ho Chi Minh and Vo Nguyen Giap. In 1940, German forces make quick work of British and French forces in France and Vichy France is created. Germany's Asian ally Japan tells Hitler they would really like to control Indochina and Hitler forces the Vichy French government to allow Japanese troops to occupy the colony. Relations between the French and Japanese occupiers fall apart and Japan ends up removing the French colonial government. Toward the end of World War II, the United States drops OSS agents into North Vietnam to aid Ho and Giap with their fight against the Japanese. They quickly determine that Ho and Gaip are leftists, but are Communists only because the Soviet Union is giving them money and weapons and are more nationalists than leftists. Ho tells them that he has always liked the U.S. Declaration of Independence and the OSS agents supply him with a copy that forms the basis of Ho's declaration of independence from France. On Sept. 26, 1945, as he is being deported by French officials, the first American killed in Vietnam, OSS agent Lt. Col. Peter Dewey is killed in a Viet Minh ambush. He may have been killed because he shouted at the ambushers in French. World War II ends. France wants its colonies back, including Indochina. The OSS tells the White House they need to tell the French to bug off, that the U.S. supports an independent French Indochina. The Paris government tells the United States that it can either back their demand for Indochina or they will go into the Soviet orbit. The State Department, watching the Soviets build the Iron Curtain across Eastern Europe, informs the White House that there are a few million worthless Asians living in Indochina and that we really need to assure that France remains our allies. So, the United States, valuing France over Indochina, back the French reoccupation of Indochina. France, though, exhausted by World Wars I and II, and beset by rebellions in other countries, don't have the military power to hold Vietnam. So, they decide to entice the Viet Minh into a trap at Dien Bien Phu and defeat them in a decisive main force pitched battle. Dien Bien Phu turned out to be a trap. And, it turned out to be a decisive main force pitched battle as the Viet Minh forced the French to surrender their garrison after a two-month siege. But now the Cold War was hot and Ho was seen not as a nationalist, but as a full-fledged Communist. The 1955 peace agreement gave Ho North Vietnam and established a constitutional monarchy in South Vietnam. With the French leaving, the United States, the protector of the non-Communist world, agrees to train and protect the new nation of South Vietnam. With half of their goals met, Ho and Giap do not give up on South Vietnam, but immediately launch a guerilla war against the new nation. The United States military sends advisers, who are not supposed to get involved in combat, but do, to support South Vietnam. The war starts to go badly for South Vietnam. One of the best analogies for the American involvement in South Vietnam is the tar baby. Slowly, but surely, American involvement increases as the United States becomes trapped in South Vietnam in the 1960s, first sending in jets and bombers, then troops to protect the air bases, then troops to take the battle to the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army, then more troops and more troops. By 1968, well over 700,000 American troops are serving in Vietnam. If there is one decision we can point to and say *THAT* decision led to the Vietnam War, it would have to be the decision made in 1945/46 to support France reacquiring Indochina to keep them (France) out of the Soviet orbit. Once the United States made that decision, everything else sort of flowed from there. ",

            "answer_text": "Many things. But the American involvement is marked by President Eisenhower\u2019s decision to not keep his word. In 1954, the Geneva Conference tried to settle ti Indochina war. The former French colony would be divided along ethnic lines into Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Vietnam was further divided in to the Communist North (Democratic Republic of Vietnam) and the non-communist South (The Republic of Vietnam) along the 17th parallel until 1956, when democratic elections would be held under international supervision The problem was that the communist leader, Ho Chi Minh, was seen as a national hero North and South for leading an almost thirty year struggle against the French. There was no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind that any honest election would deliver a communist victory. Eisenhower firmly believed that democracy should never get in the way of freedom or rather US freedom. With US help, Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m of South Vietnam held a rigged referendum (he won 98.2% of the vote, come on) to establish the South as an independent country. The Eisenhower administration declared this a fulfillment of the Geneva Agreement. How did Ike get away with it? As Historian John Lewis Gaddis said that the 1954 accords \"were so hastily drafted and ambiguously worded that, from the standpoint of international law, it makes little sense to speak of violations from either side.\" Eisenhower was one of those people who felt that freedom of others was a necessary sacrifice for the best interests of America\u2019s freedom. Or rather, being non-communist was not the same as democracy. He replaced democracies with dictatorships in Iran (1953) and Guatemala (1954) and he called fighting communism. That\u2019s why the first hates us and the second is showing up on our doorsteps. He didn\u2019t want to get involved in civil rights because it would divide the (white) country, and he thought it was more important to be unified to fight communism. Of course it was quite a shock when the Supreme Court forced him. He\u2019d picked Earl Warren as Chief Justice He was convinced that Warren wouldn\u2019t back civil rights because Warren pushed FDR to to lock up Japanese Americans. What Ike didn\u2019t realize was that the sight of American soldiers pointing guns at American Children nearly broke him and he was seeking redemption. The point is. Eisenhower didn\u2019t know what he was doing. ",
