            "answer_text": "Let us start with 3500 years BC ( the early Bronze age ) . There was the Semitic people who inhabited Mesopotamia (Iraq) , the Levant , the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa . The Mesopotamian Semites became ;the Akkadaian empire , the Assyrian empire and Babylonia . What remained of those people today are the Arabic speakers( the Arabs mainly Muslims ) , the Hebrew speakers ( the Jews) the Chaldo assyrians (Christians ) The Semites were initially Idols worshipers ;some of them became Jews , some became Christians later on , then the Muslim Arabs invaded to propagate Islam from Arabia ; the Idol worshiping Arabs of Iraq were forced into Islam . The Jews and the Christians (Arabs and chaldo assyrians) were given the option to become Muslims or pay a special tax called Jizia those who took the second option their descendants are with us today as Jews and Christians . The Iraqis of today apart from the Kurdish people are the decedents of Akkadia, Assyria and Babylonia and just before that Sumeria in Southern Iraq . As a Babylonian who lived few kilometers from the ruins of Babylon and an Arab , It may interest you to Know that the name of Babylon - Babel in Arabic is said to be derived from Babellah meaning the gate of god , also bav-il or bav- illim which in Akkadian language means the gate of god also . Another story is that the King Saba\u2019a bin Yeshjob of the Himyarite Kingdom of Yemen had invaded Mesopotamia around 3500 BC and left his son whose name was Babylon to rule the area and the town he built took his name . A further interesting thing to know that the people of the city of Babylon then used to call a person who lived outside the city an Arab in Babylonian and the people of the city of Hilla adjacent to the ruins of Babylon today call the person who lives outside the city an Arab forgetting that they are called Arabs now too ! . Whats more can I tell you ! ",
