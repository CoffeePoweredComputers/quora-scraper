            "answer_text": "Yes, a number of times, by both Germany and Japan. GERMAN OPERATIONS Soon after declaring war against the United States immediately following the Pearl Harbor attack, German dictator Adolf Hitler ordered his military to prepare a plan to land saboteurs on American soil. The task was eventually handed to the Abwehr, originally a counterintelligence agency founded soon after the First World War that by 1941 was running a worldwide espionage network.  Wilhelm Canaris, Head of the German Spy Agency, the Abwehr. Canaris Was in Reality a Dedicated Opponent of Hitler. Abwehr - Wikipedia The last days \u2014 Details about the execution of several Germans in reprisal for their involvement in anti-Nazi activities in Germany during WWII, including Canaris and the Christian pastor, Dietrich Bonhoeffer. German Intelligence Chief Wilhelm Franz Canaris Although rife with anti-Nazis, including its director, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the Abwehr nevertheless set off on this effort with some enthusiasm. Lieutenant Walter Kappe was given command of the first mission. Like all of the men he subsequently recruited, Kappe had lived for some time in the US in the years between the world wars. Eventually eight would-be operatives received a three week crash course in various aspects of sabotage, particularly the manufacture and handling of explosives. A very ambitious target list was drawn up, including hydroelectric plants at Niagara Falls, canal locks on the Ohio River between Pittsburgh, PA and Louisville, KY, and the Horseshoe Curve, a crucial installation in the foothills of the Allegheny Plateau on the heavily traveled Pennsylvania Railroad main line. The saboteurs were expected to go to ground for the next two years while conducting sustained operations against these and other targets, and had been supplied with tens of thousands of dollars in cash. Two teams of four men each were landed by U-boats on East Coast beaches, one on Long Island in the north, and the other near Jacksonville, FL, in the south. A lone Coast Guardsman somehow stumbled upon the Long Island team and actually conversed with the team leader, who eventually offered him a sizable bribe. The American took the money and ran back to his unit as the Germans fled inland. The southern team made it ashore without incident, but two members of the northern team quickly decided to abandon the mission and turn themselves in to the FBI. Eventually all were captured and tried in a military court. All were found guilty, and all but the two who had given up were executed via electric chair.

The Curve Exists to Lessen the Grade for Rail Traffic as it Climbs to the Top of the Nearby Allegheny Plateau. It Was One of the Prime Targets of a German Sabotage Mission (Operation Pastorius) in World War II. History records only one further attempt made during WWII to put German boots on the ground in the US. This was a 1944 spy mission that also failed, with both agents captured and sentenced to prison terms. In addition, a domestic spy ring operated for at least a couple of years in the runup to the war, but this had been under FBI surveillance for some time and was rolled up within a few weeks of formal US entry into the conflict. So far as is known, none of the more than 30 members of the \u201cDuquesne Spy Ring\u201d successfully accomplished any violence or sabotage against US interests or citizens.

In addition to this sort of skulduggery, Germany had ambitious plans for attacking the United States via military means. One of these took the form of numerous attempts at building what was known as the Amerikabomber. At least seven (7) designs for very long range bomber aircraft were produced, and a few got as far as the prototype stage. One of these was the Messerschmitt Me-264. Although never used in its intended role of bombing US cities, it eventually served as an ultra-long range sonderkommando aircraft flying from Finland to Japan, probably on a great circle route.  The Me-264, One of a Number of German Concepts for Their Amerikabomber, an Aircraft Capable of Hitting Targets in the US Mainland. Three Examples of This Aircraft Were Completed Before Further Production Was Cancelled in September, 1944. Note the General Similarity to the American B-29. German WW2 Amerika Bombers - Concepts and Projects Of the prototypes built for consideration as Germany\u2019s Amerikabomber, one deserves special mention. This was the Junkers Ju-390.  Brief Video Containing Various Photos of the Junkers Ju-390 Most sources state that only two (2) of these 6-engined giants were built out of a planned total of 26. However, fellow Quoran Sy Gunson has written that he has found documentary evidence which demonstrates that in fact, Junkers was paid for seven (7) examples. At least one author believes that six of these were ultimately manufactured, though whether additional units beyond the first two were actually completed is uncertain. In any case, a persistent story claims that a handful of flights during WWII by these aircraft got as far as the US East Coast. It is alleged that one of them came close enough to New York City to take photos of the Manhattan skyline. A later mission is said to have crashed into the ocean somewhere off the coast of Maine. A local sport diver claimed in an online post to have dived the wreck and retrieved a manufacturer\u2019s nameplate. It is said that there are documents in the US National Archives that confirm at least some of the story, and that US Coast Guard personnel recovered the bodies of three Luftwaffe crewmen who were on board the second Ju-390. One of these was said to be wearing insignia indicating that his rank was the German equivalent of a Captain or \u201cHauptmann\u201d. While officers of this rank flew actual combat missions, this was most often during all-out assaults with large numbers of aircraft. It would have been unusual (though not unheard of) for a Captain to have been flying a single aircraft\u2014unless this was some sort of very high priority flight or attack of some kind. Ju-390 New York flight - JunkersJu390 The kriegsmarine, the German Navy, had plans to bombard Atlantic East Coast cities with guided missiles. Nazi Germany's Secret World War II Plan to Attack America with Submarine Missiles  German Personnel Prepare a V-1 Cruise Missile for Firing. Photo Courtesy of the Bundesarchiv (German Army Museum) Via Wikipedia. Several captured German spies and naval personnel told their American interrogators that U-boats were being armed with V-1 cruise missiles. V-1 missile | military technology In response, US Navy planners organized Operation Teardrop, a vigorous and wide-ranging antisubmarine sweep composed of small aircraft carriers (escort carriers, or CVE\u2019s) and numerous destroyer escorts. When Naval Intelligence detected the approach of a German wolfpack in April, 1945, Teardrop was activated. The Americans ultimately sank 5 of the 10 or 11 U-boats operating near the East Coast at that time for the loss of one DE. Operation Teardrop - Wikipedia Ironically, none of the German submarines were in fact equipped with the V-1 or any other missile armament. While the kriegsmarine had experimented extensively with missiles and rocketry, it never achieved operational capability during the war. Additional missions were planned that would have been far more destructive than the ones that were actually carried out. These included some kind of nuclear strike against New York City, though whether this was with a hoped-for Nazi atomic or thermonuclear weapon or a dirty bomb is unclear. Both types of weapons were under development by the Germans during the war years. Hitler may have been close to building an atomic bomb William Pellas's answer to Were any nuclear bombs tested before Hiroshima and Nagasaki? A diagram often depicted as a WWII German atomic bomb targeting document apparently came not from the nuclear weapons / dirty bomb projects, but rather from a cutting edge concept known as \u201cSilbervogel\u201d\u2014Silverbird. This was (or would have been had it been built) a rocket-powered manned bomber that would reach targets in the United States mainland by launching to a height of about 90 miles above the Earth, and then \u201cskipping\u201d across the top of the atmosphere in a series of hops. The same concept was explored by both the US and the USSR after the war, and derivatives of this idea include the X-20 Dynasoar, the Space Shuttle, and current hypersonic missile projects.  WWII German Targeting Document Describing Damage From a Hoped-For Bombing of New York City by the Silbervogel Suborbital Rocket Plane. The Proposed Payload of the Silbervogel Varied Widely, but the Document Above Suggests a Three Ton Conventional Bomb. http://up-ship.com/blog/?p=2527 \u2014 Unwanted Blog post describing the document above. The source cited is German engineer Eugen Sanger\u2019s original report \u201cA Rocket Drive for Long Range Bombers\u201d. The V2 and the German, Russian and American Rocket Program More speculative but definitely interesting is the possibility that asymmetric attacks may have been planned utilizing captured German POWs who were interned in prison camps in the Desert Southwest. This is said to have included an attempt to blow up the Hoover Dam using a Rheintocter missile launched from a small submarine sailing up the Colorado River. Although the stories are largely anecdotal and allegedly relayed to the author through his personal, well off the beaten path conversations with some WWII veterans, there doesn\u2019t seem to me to be anything impossible, especially considering the fact that the Allies tried a number of operations during the war that involved their own captured personnel (notably \u201cThe Great Escape\u201d: World War Two - The Great Escape - History). In any case, in addition to the Hoover Dam story, it is claimed that at least one American C-47 twin engine transport aircraft lost to the Germans during the invasion of North Africa somehow ended up at a remote airstrip 125 miles north of Las Vegas\u2014loaded with parachutes, painted in German desert camouflage, and carrying German language flight instruction books. P-40 GOOSE SHOOT \u2014 the brief mention of the captured C-47 is in the section titled \u201cReason Two\u201d. German Submarine Attack on Hoover Dam JAPANESE OPERATIONS Japanese attacks against the American mainland were generally not as high tech but they were just as determined and creative\u2014and the last of them would have inflicted catastrophic casualties had they gone off as planned. At least two Japanese submarines bombarded US West Coast targets with their deck guns. The first of these was on 23 February 1942, when the I-17 shelled the Elwood Oil Field near Santa Barbara, California. An oil well pump house and nearby oil derrick were destroyed. The second came on 21 June, 1942, far to the north, when I-25 fired 17 shots from its main deck gun at Fort Stevens, Oregon. Damage in this incident was minimal. This same submarine would subsequently attack twice more, but not with artillery. Instead, it launched a seaplane armed with small incendiary bombs. The idea was to start forest fires in the vicinity of Brookings, Oregon. In both cases, unfavorable weather conditions and fast response by local firefighters prevented large blazes from occurring. Japanese submarine I-25 - Wikipedia http://www.pilotspost.co.za/arn0001011 \u2014 Link to the article, \u201cJapanese Submarine and Flying Boat Offensive off Zululand, 1942\u201d, from the blog Pilot\u2019s Post. This was a series of attacks by Japanese submarines and sub-launched seaplanes off the coast of South Africa during WWII.  A Pair of Yokosuka E14Y Japanese Seaplanes in Flight.

It Was Planned to Attack the Panama Canal and the US Navy Fleet Base at Ulithi Atoll With These Aircraft. Aichi M6A - Wikipedia Late war submarine missions would have had far greater potential for causing death and destruction. Bioweapon attacks that would have dropped bombs laced with plague from sub-launched seaplanes were planned for September, 1945. These were known as Operation Cherry Blossoms At Night, and the main target would have been the city of San Diego in southern California. There was a good deal of wrangling at this time between rival factions in the Japanese high command, which first approved, then moved to cancel the missions, and it is unclear if they would ultimately have been mounted had the war continued. Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night, The WW2 Japanese Plan to Wage Biological Warfare on the USA By far the most numerous attacks by Japan were from Fu-Go unmanned hydrogen-filled balloon bombs. More than 9,000 of these were launched into the Pacific Jet Stream beginning in late 1944, and it is believed that around 1,000 reached North America and nearby territories in Alaska and Hawaii. Two penetrated as far inland as Michigan. Fu-Go missions were the longest-ranged air attacks in human history until the \u201cBlack Buck\u201d Vulcan bomber raids in the 1982 Falklands War. These weapons were essentially analog technology drones. Once launched, they operated entirely autonomously. An on board altimeter controlled both a gas release valve and a ballast ring weighted with sandbags. If the balloon ascended to heights greater than 38,000 feet, hydrogen was vented so it would remain within the Pacific jet stream and continue its westerly heading. If it dropped below 20,000 feet, the release of two sandbags was triggered so the weapon would gain altitude. In addition to causing the only civilian fatalities on US soil throughout the entire war, balloon bombs also damaged the Manhattan Project by briefly knocking an electrical substation offline. This installation was providing power to the plutonium reactors located in nearby Hanford, WA.  Map Showing the North American Landing Sites of More Than 300 Japanese Balloon Bombs.

Japan's Secret WWII Weapon: Balloon Bombs 5 Attacks on U.S. Soil During World War II 11 Secret Weapons Developed By Japan During World War 2 It is also reported in Robert Wilcox\u2019s book, Japan\u2019s Secret War, that at least two Japanese were landed in Mexico by a German U-boat sometime in 1943. These were part of an international spy ring that included the notorious Falangist, Angel Alcazar de Velasco. The Spaniard had gotten wind of some details about the Manhattan Project but most of his information concerned the East Coast branch of the atomic bomb effort that was centered in Oak Ridge, TN. The Japanese personnel were put ashore in an attempt at gathering soil samples that could be tested for radioactivity. According to de Velasco, they hiked overland into Arizona before returning to Mexico. The Los Alamos superlab, the brain center of the Manhattan Project, was actually located in New Mexico, but the Japanese were nevertheless sniffing around in the correct general area. ",

            "answer_text": "Fort Stevens, on the far North Oregon Coast was briefly attacked by a Japanese submarine (I-25) June 21, 1942. The night assault wasn\u2019t very well executed; 17 shots were fired, landing in the forest around the installation\u2019s cement batteries. The only damage reported was in a baseball field. Seeing little benefit to returning fire, and wary of exposing the fort\u2019s heavy gun capabilities and location, base command never returned fire. The attack was witnessed by the nearby towns of Astoria and Seaside, which went into blackout and stayed that way throughout the war. I-25 returned later that year to try again in September, this time on Oregon\u2019s southern coast. The Japanese launched a Yokosuka E14Y floatplane from the sub, which flew over and attempted twice to fire-bomb the forested area near the town of Brookings. The wet forest suffered no damage, and the city didn\u2019t hold a grudge after the war. In fact, the pilot of the Japanese plane, Nobuo Fujita visited Brookings often as an honorary citizen until his death in 1997.
