            "answer_text": "Because soldiers, or any members of the U. S. Military - Marines, Sailors, and Airmen - begin their service at a young age. This is true not just in Vietnam, but in any war (or peacetime). A typical enlisted recruit is 18 years old, and 17 year olds can join as long as their parent or guardian signs a waiver. I think they look so young to most people because movies and television more often than not have actors in their late 20\u2019s or early 30\u2019s in roles as junior enlisted, and 40 - 50 year olds as senior enlisted. I think the movie image of what a \u201csoldier\u201d should look like is ingrained in a lot of people\u2019s minds. ",

            "answer_text": "The age to register for the draft is 18 years old.  At the time, legally and citizenship-wise you really were note a full-fledged adult until you were 21 years old, like for voting and of legal drinking age. It is called the age of emancipation.  So you could serve your country by signing a legal contract to join (or be drafted) but you could not vote or buy an alcoholic drink. How discriminatory was that ??? The overall age of ALL MILITARY in Viet Nam was over 21; but those were the junior enlisted ranks *(think petty officers)*. The Army ground-pounders (or even drafted Marines ~ yes you could then get drafted into the Marines) ~ that got their asses drafted WERE 18 or 19. Or you could have been one of these ASSHOLES:    ",
