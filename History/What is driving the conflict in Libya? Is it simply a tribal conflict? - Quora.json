            "answer_text": "I always find it hilarious when fellow Westerners boil down every issue occurring in the Middle East / North Africa as simply being \u201ctribal conflicts\u201d. Though some issues do have some vague tribal undertones it really isn\u2019t always as simple as that. The core of the Libyan issue is that after Muamar Gadaffi was killed Libya had a power vacuum and didn\u2019t have a smooth transition into power as there was no clear leader ready to replace Gadaffi\u2019s spot. That\u2019s when the military warlord named Hafter (who was extremely prominent in past Libyan wars) made a comeback and slowly but surely amassed enough supporters in Eastern Libya. He then went on a campaign annexing various Libyan cities in the East and trying to deligitimize the internationally recognized government based in the Western portion of the nation (especially in Tripoli which is Libya\u2019s capital). Currently Hafter is still trying to snatch Tripoli as he does not want Libya to be fragmented into two nations (which is looking more and more likely since he is having a hard time toppling the internationally recognized government now that Turkey has stepped in as an ally). It is also important to note that Hafter is generally being supported by fellow dictator Sissi from Egypt, the corrupt Gulf nations, France (for economical reasons since Haftar controls most of the oil fields) and Russia (which is trying to slowly but surely exert more influence in the Middle East / North Africa for access to the Mediterranean and geopolitical clout). This is what the lines of control look like in Libya at the moment:  ",

            "answer_text": "Tribes are a tool, The problem is no constitution and plenty of misconceptions. Tribes + misconceptions + fire arms = series wars. Heftar and the other politicians and TV guys are abusing the simple minded tribes to get the vast money they couldn\u2019t get during Gaddafy time, as he was keeping most of it for him self. The severity of the misconceptions however, is too deep. Like they are refusing the idea of voting with yes and no on the constitution. Some of them goes radical and wants to avenge the destruction that happened to Benghazi, while they have done it, fighting their own people. What is driving the fight? Well, if we give them the oil they are demanding, we can turn them into the defensive position. Their leaders always wants corruption to be put on the westerns so they look like saviors. Another thing driving the fight is the westerns letting them negotiate while we can finish the fight through brute force of the military power and force the elections on constitution. From my point of view, the biggest leader for the fight is the media. If we manage to colonize them through FB ads. And break down their misconceptions, we might be able to make them leave their current positions and make the barrel point to their corrupt leaders. The step after is they either admit they were wrong and go for elections or, their pride controls them as any other Bedwen, and they demand the State of Cyrenica. And the war starts again on the oil fields and the oil exportation harbors as they originally believe it is inside Cyrenica land that they have re created. I think this is the best option as in the worst scenario of war on oil. The war will be in the open areas and no damage to civilians is done. Last paragraph is hard to execute? do some military advancement and see how their confidence in Heftar and the entire project breaks down. They supported the project for so long losing plenty of lives. They can be shattered down easily with several losses. Making them question their cause and open a bit for new ideas. ",
