            "answer_text": "Hi, there. I assume that you mean, \u201cwhat can a witch do that pertains to witchcraft.\u201d Otherwise the list would include things like \u201creroof your house, do your taxes, perform surgery, and many other things,\u201d considering that witches have all sorts of different occupations. OK, so with that assumption, let\u2019s proceed. Witchcraft is a massively broad group of studies. Each and every person who studies and practices witchcraft will have very different skills, as they probably study different areas of the Craft. After all, a human life isn\u2019t long enough to become expert in all things witchcraft. That would take many lifetimes. Many witches study things like herbalism, energy healing, Eastern Medicine, wildcrafting, green eco-conservation, organic gardening, meditation and trance, crystal work, potion making, Ceremonial Magic, Candle Magic, Chaos Magic, spiritualism, mediumship, oracular work, animal communication, kitchen witchery, Goetic Magic, hex signs, sigils, runes, Astrology, Tarot, Geomancy, dowsing, and a whole lot of other subjects. Some witches can wield their skills impressively. Some cannot. Witchcraft is not like in the movies. It doesn\u2019t break natural laws and make stuff go \u201cpoof.\u201d We can\u2019t turn you into a mermaid. But we can probably make you a tasty tea to get rid of your tummy ache and clear your house of that nasty former tenant\u2019s ooky energy. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re \u201cmagic.\u201d We just study arcane and interesting subjects and gain skills in those that interest us. ",

            "answer_text": "Witchcraft. But what is a witch and what would witchcraft be? I looked into this for you. It turns out that witches and witchcraft are really just words for people and things that people do. Anyone could be a witch. Any human being at all. I looked into magic for you too. It turns out that there is magic and then there is high magic. The regular kind of magic is like making soap or making leavened bread. The high magic is making changes in your own self. I don\u2019t know about you but I don\u2019t use words like witch or witchcraft because I think it is more accurate to say something like Sally baked bread. Oh, I should probably mention that Hollywood versions of this are for entertainment not education. ",
