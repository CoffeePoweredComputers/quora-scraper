            "answer_text": "Possibly. Other people discovered North America before him, of course, but it\u2019s not clear how or why they did so. Around 15,000 years ago, plus or minus a millennium, people entered the Americas from the direction of Asia. At the moment, all we\u2019ve got from them is a few tools, so we don\u2019t really know where they started out, though our understanding of the climate of the time suggests that they came around the coast of Ice Age Siberia, Alaska, and Canada, turning inland in what\u2019s now the Pacific Northwest. Were they, indeed, exploring, searching for new lands or resources? Were they simply pursuing already known animals or fish they were hunting? We don\u2019t know. What this means is that, if we consider this question very narrowly, we know that they discovered the Americas thousands of years before Erik did, but we might not be justified in calling them explorers. That said, Erik the Red is the first named explorer we can identify with one of the many discoveries of North America. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Not even counting only the European discovery. He sailed west because of previous reports - or so say the sagas. He was seeking a land which others had seen & reported they\u2019d seen. It had even been named after one of them - Gunnbjorn Ulfsson. Gunnbjorn was followed, decades later, by Sn\u00e6bj\u00f6rn galti H\u00f3lmsteinsson. Sn\u00e6bj\u00f6rn failed to found a settlement, but is reckoned to have reached the mainland of Greenland, which Gunnbjorn didn\u2019t, seeing only smaller islands. He\u2019s reported to have overwintered there, but strife broke out among his men & he was killed. The survivors returned to Iceland. Erik the Red sailed eight years after Sn\u00e6bj\u00f6rn. He knew of Sn\u00e6bj\u00f6rn\u2019s failure, but also that he\u2019d found land, not mere small island. Erik never saw the mainland of North America. His son Leif did, years later. ",
