            "answer_text": "I asked this question expecting at least one answer to try to make a serious attempt to defend the notion that destroying monuments destroys history\u2026 But I got bupkis. In general all the people opposed to the removal of these monuments have used circular reasoning: You\u2019re destroying history because monuments are historical and therefore you\u2019re destroying history. Is the basic framework from which they derive. This answer was almost like a haiku:  You know, like Drew Barrymore in 50 first dates. In the comments I asked him about people that don\u2019t have monuments. He insulted me and described those people to me. I guess we don\u2019t need monuments to remember history! He also spouted off some garbage about how the first shot at Battle of Fort Sumter came from a Union Tax ship even though it\u2019s well documented to have been proudly fired by Lt. Henry S. Farley, acting upon the command of Capt. George S. James. Yay, history! It looks like those monuments really did help keep things real! He also spouted off some nonsense about how confederate soldiers were the best infantry ever because they didn\u2019t have shoes in the winter. So\u2026yeah\u2026 Next, I had a discussion with a guy that said that since the monuments are important to some people at some time, they should stand forever. Then he changed his mind and said if the locality wants to take them down then they should, but \u201cHISTORY!\u201d He couldn\u2019t clarify what history was being lost or how, just \u201cHISTORY!\u201d The big unanswered question I posed in all of this was: What if I put up a ridiculous monument: \u201cBART LOEWS THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, FIRST MAN ON MARS\u201d Is that history because it\u2019s a monument? Because the confederate monuments all reflect a feeling at the time amongst the landed white folk that it\u2019s important that we remind the freed slaves of their place. Each rush to put up more of them coincided with surges in civil rights. But he couldn\u2019t address that other than to say \u201cHISTORY!\u201d He couldn\u2019t resist this bit, though:  He then confessed that he had nothing to discuss with anyone about this since he disagrees with any removal whatsoever (including the BART IS GOD monument, I suppose). Basically, this is a massive strawman. \u201cHurt feelings\u201d doesn\u2019t even begin to describe the discrimination, murder, torture, prejudice, and economic repression an entire group of people has gone through in the past 150 years and these PROMONUMENT folk sneer down their noses at the assertion. Then he constructs a massive straw men that the purpose for taking them down is to erase the past. No. Seriously, take some time to talk to someone about this who has different feelings from you. Literally no one is trying to forget the past. We\u2019re trying to reframe the past in a more literal light, more reflective of what actually happened, taking into account the history of the powerless rather than honor and glorify the white folk that wanted to keep them in chains who\u2019s history has actually been re-written by modern apologists to make them seem less awful by today\u2019s standards. Who\u2019s the snowflake now, wilting and fading in the light of history? ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t. People don\u2019t learn history by going to a statue in the town square Statues were not put up to teach or record history, they were put up to venerate an individual The problem isn\u2019t that we want to destroy history, it\u2019s that we don\u2019t think we should be venerating certain people. Many of those are confederate soldiers and generals who fought in defense of owning other humans as property. These were also traitors to the country. Both of these features makes it odd any patriotic, humane American would want a statue of them Also, many confederate statues were not put up during or immediately after the Civil War, but rather during the Civil Rights movement by racist white southerners as a response to the Civil Right movement. When it comes to statues of Columbus (which is nowhere near a new issue) you have to remember a few things. 1. He didn\u2019t discover America (at least the US), nor was he the first European in the Americas 2. He committed terrible atrocities and genocide on the native people he came across. There\u2019s literally no reason to idolize him in the US Now, to restate the issue. Destroying statues doesn\u2019t destroy history as statues do not record historyPutting a statue in a museum (say, to explain the racism of southerners in the 1950\u2019s and 60\u2019s) does not destroy historyNot every historical figure is worthy of veneration. Yes, it\u2019s important to learn about them, but not all of them are worth idolizing",
