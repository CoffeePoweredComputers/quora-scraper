            "answer_text": "Sri Lankan civulization is probably older than the Aryan civilization in India. Aryan folklore has recognized that the island of Sri Lanka, called \u201c\u201cLanka\" in Sanskrit, had existed when Aryans had settled in the Indo Gangetic plains. There are references to human settlements in Sri Lanka in these folklores. This leads us to believe that permanent human settlements in Sri Lanka may date back to the times of the Dravidian civilizations of Moenjodaro etc or more or less thereabouts. This may be 6,000 years ago or even somewhat earlier. ",
