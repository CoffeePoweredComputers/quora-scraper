            "answer_text": "Plato had a huge influence on the development of Christianity. An early Greek Pagan, Justin Martyr (AD 130-165) converted to Christianity because he saw the way early Christians bore persecution and was reminded of the way Socrates handled his death. Justyn went on to write several treatises arguing that Platonic virtues were best demonstrated by Christians. This proved to be a big selling point in bringing pagan Greeks to Christianity. Another early church father, Tertullian condemned  the Socrates/Jesus parallel at some length but the fact that he needed to do that at all indicates how much traction the idea had already gained among Pagan Greeks embracing Christianity. In the end, Justyn had more success as the shared traits of Platonism and Christianity were so obvious. The two biggest ones were the idea that we lived in a second-rate version of a perfect world that existed on a higher plane. The other was that the body was a corrupt vessel for the eternal soul.  The argument refused to die. Christian philosopher Origen (182-254 AD) said basically that Jesus' death, though noble like Socrates' was superior because he died for the one true God. The Plato/Jesus connection was debated pro and con throughout the founding of the early church and after. Eventually, the platonists won out.  The Christian Platonist, Plotinus (204-270 AD) became one of the most read and revered philosophers of early Christianity. In fact, during the Middle Ages, influential theologians like St. Bonaventure and the popular poet Dante Alighieri treated Socrates and Plato as honorary Christians. In Dante's Inferno, pagan philosophers are treated to a not-very-unpleasant level of Hell: Tutti lo miran, tutti onor li fanno:quivi vid\u2019 \u00efo Socrate e Platone,che \u2019nnanzi a li altri pi\u00f9 presso li stanno; All gaze upon him, and all do him honor.There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,Who nearer him before the others stand; So, yes, early Christianity is shot through with Plato and Platonism and it continues to influence Christian thought (through Augustine, particularly) up to this day. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very interesting question you have put here. Let's start off first with what Christianity is and it's origins. This is very important in answering your question. Then I will get to your main question.  The True Origin of Christianity The most fundamental belief in early Christianity is that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah. The Jewish Messiah was a political and religious figure who was predicted throughout the Old Testament. His predicted roles were to: 1) defeat Israel's enemies, 2) lead the world to worship Yahweh, 3) bring world peace and, 4) rule the entire world. Furthermore, some Old Testament passages suggest that the Messiah might be God himself (Zechariah 12-14).  As you may have noticed, such a figure is worthless if he is dead. You simply cannot be both dead and King of the world and militarily defeating Israel's enemies. This is why the death and crucifixion of Jesus was so initially disappointing to His disciples. Like all other Messiah claimants, he appeared to have simply come and gone, failing at his mission, dying at the hands of the Romans.  But a radical and unexpected disconfirmation of this disappointment occurred during Jesus' resurrection. Due to the 1) appearances and 2) empty tomb, the disciples came to believe that Jesus had once again risen to life. No long was all hope lost. Because of his resurrection, he really can fulfill all these Messianic perogatives in the end times.  Back to your original question:  Notice what I am doing here. I am trying to show that Christianity has incredibly strong Jewish roots and background. Jesus was an orthodox Jewish rabbi who believed he was fulfilling last days prophecies about the Jewish Messiah. The disciples of Jesus followed this Jewish Rabbi in expectation that he was the Jewish Messiah. The words of Jesus can only be used to support these ideas Although early church fathers were educated in Greek thought (as was Paul the apostle), Jewish thinking dominated the early church. When apostle Paul brought the message of Jesus resurrection and future judgment to Athens Greece, they mocked him because of his belief in the resurrection of dead. (Acts 17). Furthermore, the monotheism of early Christianity (with Jesus at the center) was wildly different from the polytheism (and other concepts of ultimate reality) of the Greeks. Only later was Christianity translated into Greek philosophical terms (likely at Nicea: see NT Wright) without any of the actual content being changed.  Long story short, very early Christianity is too Jewish to have been influenced at all by Greek thought, especially Plato's Republic, since a closer comparison of Jewish and Greek thought shows utter dissimilarities on afterlife, the concept of God/gods, ultimate reality, and other issues.  Furthermore, all core Christian beliefs were present among 1st Century Christian writings (the New Testament-which was written by Jews) before Greek thought had much of an influence on the actual language used to convey Christian belief.
