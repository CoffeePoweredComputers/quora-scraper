            "answer_text": "I will give you a comprehensive answer to this, hoping that will apply to any possible questions related to the early history, pertaining to both ethnic groups. Although Albanians and Romanians are Indo-Europeans by language, a common origin could only be through Vlachs, the Romanized population of the area. Lets see why. Romanian is assumed to be a mostly Latinized language, a language that could have evolved in a few centuries anywhere inside the Eastern Roman Empire\u2019s boundaries, either was pre or post Aurelian Roman Provinces of Dacia (170 \u2013 600 years), Moesia (600 years), Thracia (700 years), Scythia Minor (400-600 years), Illyria (800 years), Pannonia (400-500 years), then evolve 2\u20133 centuries on the high grounds of the Carpathian Mountains and the Balkan Mountains, perfectly suiting their pastoral way of life, either as Dacian or later attested as Vlachs. Once formed during several centuries as a Romanized ethnicity, identifiable by themselves and others as Romans, belonging to the Roman Empire, their pastoral way of life in the mountains helped preserve ethnicity and culture. Certain is that the Vlachs succeeded in preserving Roman identity, above and bellow Danube and between the 5 - 13 Centuries are well documented. First as indigenous Romans and Roman shepherds, either in the Pannonian plain, as part of the Hun army, in the West Carpathians -between (north) Morava River (Vlach fields) to Vah River, to Tatra Mountains. Bellow Danube are known as Romans, before the Roman Empire turned to Greeks, early 7 Century, then they appear as Armanji, Rumuni and Vlachs, since 8 - 9 Century onwards, located mostly South, West and Central of Balkan Peninsula.So, from 9 Century onwards are referred to as Vlachs, documented as inhabiting principalities as far north in the North Carpathian, to the Peloponnese Peninsula and Thessaly in the South and from the Pannonian plain to the Dniester river, up to Bug river at times. For the Medieval South and West Balkans there is Serb king Milutin\u2019s Chronicle, dated end of XIII century (1282), describing his interception of 10,000 armors from the Vlachs of Ragusa - Dalmatia, to Negru Voda - Ruler of Wallachia - meant to supply the north Danube principality for war against the Hungarian Kingdom, an event that seems to have suited the Ruler of Rascia. Emboldened by the capture, his records noted the engage in conquest campaigns, to the south and south west, against Vlach states. There is also a conclusive German Map of the time, drawn slightly above Albania, over the states of Zeta, Bosna and current Herzegovina, showing the population of the area as mostly Vlach tribes, spread over the coastal area and Dalmatian mountains. To complete the picture of south and south west Balkans, during the XIII - XIV Centuries, there is also what Stephan Dusan understood to name himself and his Empire, by his own official titles, in documents and on coins, by 1350s, \u201cimperator Raxie et Romanie, dispotus L\u2019artae et Vlachie comes\u201d - Emperor of Rascia and Romania, Despot of Arta and Duke of Valachia. Today is interpreted to fit the present, as \u201cEmperor of Serbs, Greeks and Albanians.\u201d, even though Romania could mean all nations within the then defunct Byzantine Empire, in the Balkans, Greeks and Vlachs included, Arta or Epirus could also refer to all or any of Greeks, Vlachs and Albanians, Rascia referring to Serbs, while Valahia clearly refers to a Vlach state, independent of Byzantines and subdued by the Serb Emperor, until Serb Empire collapsed a few years later, at Dusan\u2019s death in 1355.As for Albanians: No one can explain how the Albanian language \u2018survived\u2019 \u201c800\u201d years under Roman rule, across the Adriatic Sea, on Via Egnatia \u201chighway\u201d, linking Rome to Constantinople, without being Romanized, without written attestation prior to 11th Century Norman invasion, a first record where Albanians are also clearly located in Sicily. There are plenty of documents describing the Illyrian tribes, including those of today\u2019s Albania and after the early 1st Century AD crushed Illyrian Revolt, all tribes appear as led by Romanized native Illyrian lords, self-described as \u201cPrinceps Casteli\u201d, while their fortresses abounded in Roman lifestyle and Latin written epitaphs.The structure of Albanian language is rather Baltic - Celtic - Germanic, a language academically proven by Western scholars to originate in North Europe. A language that at some point in time evolved in the proximity of Indo-Iranian and Proto-Armenian. Could be the North-East Europe spot of the Proto-Indo-European split, prior to the Balto - Celtic -Germanic shift towards West, or a Balto-Germanic tribe of South Caucasus? Arbanites are a good candidate, matching the criteria, because: Were attested to be a Germanic tribe of Caucasus, in the Caucasian Albania; Were also in the proximity of the Roman Empire, expanding to Caucasus since the 1st Century AD; Were in the proximity of the Armenians; Were also \u2018next door\u2019, across the Rha River, from the current Balkan neighbor, Alano - Iranian Serbs and also nearby the Turano - Iranian Avars. They are all in Caucasus prior to the 5th Century, they all reappear in North Europe, along and between Balto-Slavic and East Germanic tribes, from the 6th Century onwards. All except the Albanians appear to be resettled in North-West Balkans, after the turn of the Latin speaking Eastern Roman Empire to the Byzantine Greeks. So the assumption is that the Arbanites could have arrived along, stood by the Avars in South West Ukraine and Pannonia and possibly confused with, lost within the whole Turano - Iranian group, even suspected that time to be of pseudo-Avars. A possible answer to this could be the western \u2018Bulgars\u2019, defeated and subjected by the Lombards, of Alboin, they later moved along into Italy. Could they have been remnants of the Hunnic alliance, gathered and shifted from Caucasus in Central Europe, or arrived within the Bulgar group, the original Hunnic remnants, brought back in the Avar alliance, then, when the time was right, further departed from their previous masters? Is possible that the Arbanites were in or were the western group of \u2018Bulgars\u2019, once in Central Europe they could have settled with the Lombards, the Gepids or other East Germanic tribes, like the Vandals or Rugii. The Vandals and Rugii could also comply with the Balto - Germanic linguistic condition of present Albanians, following an attested move or path to known Albanian locations. As Vandals, could have moved from the Baltic area - North Europe, to South East Poland and West Ukraine, then into Pannonia, as Hasdingi, Lacringi and to Silesia, as Silingi and at some point in time settled and moved along a group, attested to arrive in or nearby South Italy. Attested candidates could be the Ostrogoths and the Lombards. Knowing that the Gothic language of Ostrogoths, Gepids and the Germanic Lombard language were different from Albanian, we can trace other moving along candidates. Part of the Rugii are attested to be resettled b Marcian, mid 5th Century, in Thrace, they are also attested to move along the Ostrogoths and Lombards and in early medieval times those two Germanic groups arrived in South Italy. As Vandals, a group is attested to move to Britain and for centuries Britain was named \u201cAlbania\u201d after them; Another group of Vandals, along the Iranian Alans moved all the way to North Africa and, from there, the 100 years Vandalic kingdom invaded and occupied Sicily and South Italy. Has also been proposed that Albanians came to South Italy from North-West Europe, along Normans and, in this case, they could be the Albans that carried the Albanian name from Britain to Sicily and from Sicily to current Albania. To go back to where we started, the Arbanite also resonates with the self-described Arbereshe endonym, unless \u201cArber\u201d stands for Ar - as identified after the Arab conquest of north Africa and south Italy, and Berber - for the population mix of North Africa; including the Baltic-East Germanic-Iranian population of Vandal - Alanian kingdom, also with a direct impact on populations of south Italy. Another possible answer could be that such \u2018Arber\u2019 population mix could have been carried from North Africa to South Balkans by Heraclius the Elder, with his 100,000 Berber army, at 609\u2013610 siege of Constantinople and resettled to replace the Roman Balkan army. A Roman army of Balkans that disintegrated soon after the Eastern Roman Empire turned to Greeks and Greek language in 612. Yet another possible answer could be a direct shift of South Caucasian population, from the Eastern most area of the Roman Empire, to its Western frontier, which, at times, included North Africa and South Italy. But a population shift that could have occurred after the Latin speaking Roman Empire has turned to Greek, or in an area of slight or interrupted peripheral influence, also late enough not to acquire Greek influence. Nikephoros I is know to have shifted populations into South Balkans by early IX Century, but he is also known to have applied the resolution of the 787 Second Council of Niceea, that imposed Greek as the only liturgical language over the Byzantine Empire, meant to assimilate into Greek all the Byzantine population. Resolution that could have cleared over the centuries all or most linguistic traces of other ethnic groups in South Balkans. Alexios Komnenos is known to have shifted, engaged South Caucasian and Anatolian populations during the Seljuk and Norman Wars, but the first written records about Albanians predate by a few decades these wars. In fact they start to appear between the time Norman mercenaries were expelled by George Maniakes from South Italy and the return of a Norman army, to take Sicily and South Italy for themselves.Properly analyzed, corroborated with all related info, there is a clear picture not only on the genetic make up but also on the genetic evolution, of the Albanian ethnic group, into the area, which, looked beyond the appearance, comes to confirm the real story. A story that can be scientifically proven to anyone in doubt.Illyrian theory. Illyrian was a Centum language, Albanian is Satem. All the frenzy to link Albanian to Illyrian had turned into ridicule , when the only text thought to be in Illyrian language has proven to be an upside down Byzantine Greek. Ultimately, by reconstructing possible Illyrian candidates, such as Dalmatian and Messapian, most scholars agreed that Illyrian was rather similar to part of Italic languages, best candidate being the Friuli Language. As for Messapian language, even Romanian could stand as a better candidate, compared to Albanian, for a most probably Thracian origin of the Messapian language.Common words with Romanian are about 100, rather similar but spelled slightly different, the toponymy of the area shows clear signs of being inhabited earlier by a romance population, a heavily decreasing Vlach population in the last few centuries, properly documented for the area, all those can imply a common origin, but rather more plausibly inherited directly from the Vlachs, preserved as part of the Vlach\u2019s vocabulary.Flip side of history A possible Dacian connection, dated before or during the Roman times, could only place the homeland of the Albanians outside the Roman boundaries, in the proximity of free Dacians, but also could shed light, change what is assumed about the early history, language, origins of the Romanians. If there was a Dacian connection between Albanians and Romanians, that could be through the Dacian Costoboci, located in the north area of Moldova. north Carpathians and south west Ukraine. They are clearly recorded to be a northern kingdom of free Dacians, were defeated in 170s AD above the North Carpathians and incorporated within Hasdingi Vandals, at Roman request. Then by 330s Hasdingi and Lacringi Vandals were resettled by Constantine the Great in Pannonia, on todays Banat area, where they could have incorporated another Dacian tribe of \u2018Albocensi\u2019 - also known to have moved to Iberia. By 406 Vandals advanced on Danube into Gaul and along Alans defeated the Franks, from where by 409 a part of Vandals crossed into Britain, another part moved south and got Roman land into Iberian Peninsula. In 418 were crushed by the Visigoths and those who escaped crossed, along Alans, into North Africa, where they founded the Kingdom of the Vandals and Alans.Another mix of Celtic - East Germanic people, originated on Vistula in Poland area, and resettled East, along the Dacian Costoboci and Carpi, above the North Carpathians and East Moldovan areas, were the Bastarnae. Their territory and culture overlapped with the Dacian areas for nearly 5 Centuries and disappeared from the historical sources, resettled into Moesia, along their buddies in arms, the Dacian Carpi. Dacian Carpi appear to be resettled in different areas, during Probius, Diocletian, Galerius and Constantine, by the end of 3rd Century beginning of 4th Century, last time into north Balkans and Scythia Minor, along about 100,000 Bastarnae. Late settle could also explain a Roman influence, but an eluded Romanization, during the turbulent times of Gothic migrations, Hunnic invasion and a possible dilution within those waves, only to surface as distinguished ethnic identity few centuries later. Archeological discoveries though, from Scythia Minor and Moesia Inferior, dated back to 3 - 6 Centuries, unearthed multiple traces of Christian temples and Latin use in daily life, which points out to Latinity and early Christianity of a Romanized population, inhabiting the area during that time.An identifiable Dacian connection of Albanians with the Daco-Romanians, that could have evolved mostly outside the Roman Empire boundaries, along the factual majority of Free Dacians, would also raise serious questions about the level of Romanization, Latinity of Romanians and the structure of the Romanian language. Whether there was a complete assimilation, Latinization of the Romanian language, as assumed today, or we talk about a mostly Dacian language, by structure and vocabulary, touched by Latinity, as lingua franca and liturgical language, but similar to Latin (a Celticized Thracian language itself), a Dacian language that shared many cognates with Thracian and Latin, but is in fact a Balkan language by structure, different in this respect from Latin and other Romance - Thracian languages. A certain point in this direction would have made Herodotus and Strabo, as they considered the Daco - Getian language to be related to, mutually intelligible with the Thracian language. Should we trust these guys? Living examples could be any related modern languages, standing alone for certain rhotacizations, pronunciations or influences, but still considered as different languages. ",

            "answer_text": "yes, all humans originally came to Europe from Africa. Seriously, the \"common origin\" idea is based on 20 or 30 words which exist in the Romanian and Albanian languages and apparently don't exist in any other language, and on mistakenly equating the Getae (documented around year 500 BC to around 300 BC in Dobrudgea) with the Dacians (\u0394\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9 in Greek, documented between around 50 BC to 106 AD) just because the Romans, notorious snobs, sometimes called the Dacians as Getae just to show off that they read Herodotus. We know some about the Getae because the Greeks colonies near the Black Sea traded and fought with them and often were were amused to treat them as noble sauvages and to attribute them all sorts of special and esoteric pieces of wisdom, and we know very little about the Dacians except that they lived some 300 or 400 km to the North-West of the area where the Getae were known to live and that the Romans fought with them. The Getae were Tracians (as Herodotus puts it, the best of an evil lot), about the Dacians we don't have any clue except those inspired by a desire to prove that the Romanians inhabited Romania since the early Paleolithic (I am being sarcastic here, the claim extends only to the Neolithic and that only because some American archaeologist started the fashion). Had Trajan been a better writer and had \"De bello dacico\" been preserved we might have known more but as it is there is no conclusive written proof that the Getae had anything to do with the Dacians, and only some archaeological clues that the Dacians might have been Celts with some descendants of the Scythians thrown in the mix. There is no need for a common origin to explain those 30 words. There were very strong and very long relations between Albanians and Romanians since at least the XIVth century, including several princes of Albanian origin in the Romanian principalities in the XVIth and the XVIIth centuries, consistent migration to the north and trade both ways, even enough Albanians in the Romanian armies and police in the XVIIIth and XIXth centuries to give their name to a branch of the cavalry. Until about 1830 Albanian Christians could obtain citizenship in the Romanian principalities by simply buying land or houses there and were allowed to hold office, and lots of them did both. This was nothing special since the same was allowed to the Armenians (one prince in Moldavia), Georgians (at least one bishop in Wallachia), Greeks (princes and bishops and lots of magistrates in both Principalities), Italians, Poles, Germans or Bohemians or Russians or French or Hungarians etc. who all moved here when chased by religious wars or taxes or guild laws or revolutions or civil wars or simply looking for a place where nobody bothered to care much about them as long as they were at least barely Christian and could at least fake paying the property tax.

But the common roots can be best settled as follows: Romanians are not Dacian-descendants alone, they are descendants of latin Thracians, who always called their language \u201cromana\u201d since they founded the Romania - the Empire of Constantinople, the citizen of which were \u2026 Romani. The Albanians, are descending from the Ilyrians, which were a related - but not but not a subfamily - to Thracians. So not really common but related roots. There is one more aspect about it - Albanians and Romanians are the only descendants of the antique populations of South-East Europe, which did not get Slavizised. So this strengthens the similitude. No common sensic person will deny the fact that Serbians, and even more Bulgarians - that, both, assimilated great masses of Romanized Thracians in their early and even more recent history - are not in this respect ALSO related to Romanians. Yes, but they are Slavs, so this corelations is not dominant, it is recessive, so to speak\u2026 ",

Talking about the Dacians (which were a part of the Thracians) cause , the word \"dava\" or \"deva\" stands for settlement. Here is map with the collaged part of the zone where Thermidava should be.    \"Thermidava was an ancient Dacian town in Illyria mentioned by Ptolemy (90-168, C.E.) as an inland town of Dalmatia. It could be located near modern Scodra (Albania). Roman Emperor Trajan marched with his troops for Naissus and crossed Thermidava prior to the Roman-Dacian Wars. In the town he was greeted by Dacians. The next town he passed was Ulpiana.\" Yes, someone could refer about the demarcation zone between Thracians and Illyrians as the place starting where the Drava river joins the Danube following the Danube near the Iron Gates and then \"the border\" is changing its direction maybe towards Macedonia, but those two populations actually lived on the both sides of the border. The Illyrians did not live only in Illyria and the Dacians did not live only in Dacia, so regarding the claimed origins we discover a large space of confluence between the Thracians and the Illyrians.

            "answer_text": "I have very limited information to this, but according to some theories, Romanians come from Thracians and Albanians from Illyrians. Those two peoples have inhabited Balkans since forever, so they have exchanges their culture. There are plenty of language similarities between us, and according to some etymologists their capital, Bukurest, is derived from Bukurishte, which could be translated as \"beauty\" or \"beautiful place\". The scale of their similarities between each other needs further studying, but all I can say is that before they became distinct as Illyrians and Thracians, they might have been the children of the same parents.

And the second answer was, the history of romanian and albanian is still an enigma, if we found out the history about the development of one languages we will know then also about the other one. The answer is, we don`t know it. ",
