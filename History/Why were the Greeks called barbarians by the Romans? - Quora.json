            "answer_text": "Romans did not call Greeks Barbarians, it was the other way around. The Greek term \u03b2\u03ac\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 / barbaros is a word for people that do not speak Greek. It didn\u2019t carry the same primitive, uncivilized meaning the modern term implies. Non Greek speakers seemed to \u201cbar bar bar,\u201d as in speak nonsense. Later during the Roman Empire the term gained its current meaning as Rome faced European and Asian opponents to the north and east.  Much remaining Roman art depicts conflicts with barbarians For Love of Greece To the Romans starting in the 2nd century BC with the conquest of Greece, Greek culture was emulated, imported and adored (though opposed by conservatives like Kato, who lost the argument). Greeks were bringers of culture, the highly educated experts, refined learners\u2026 they educated the entire Roman aristocracy in the Republic and Empire. Greek temples displaced Roman temples as Rome was rebuilt with monumental marble architecture. Looted bronze Greek statues were adored, copied in marble, disseminated across the Roman world. The Romans even mapped their own pantheon of gods to match the Greek gods! That is how much admiration they had for Greek culture, which was seen as ancient wisdom.  Greek Gods and their Roman equivalents The Roman Boot But as a conquered people enslaved by the hundreds of thousands during the Roman conquest of Greece, Greeks were looked down upon as untrustworthy and dull in the ways of life compared to the Romans who were made to rule others. Not quite full persons like Romans, great to know but not the same quality. Romans thought Greeks conspired among one another, always talking trash, the way some American racists that don\u2019t speak Spanish assume Spanish speakers are insulting them when talking to one another. Completely racist and strange, though I don\u2019t think racist is the term for the ancient world?  The Roman conquest of Greece was awful, enslaving 100s of thousands of Greeks There is a great quote from Plutarch, a Greek historian and politician during the first and century AD about how Greek politicians should make a name for themselves but always be mindful of the Roman boot. And when entering upon any office whatsoever, you must not only call to mind those considerations of which Pericles reminded himself when he assumed the cloak of a general: \"Take care, Pericles; you are ruling free men, you are ruling Greeks, Athenian citizens,\" but you must also say to yourself: \"You who rule are a subject, ruling a State controlled by proconsuls, the agents of peace; 'these are not the spearmen of the plain,' nor is this ancient Sardis, nor the famed Lydian power.\" You should arrange your cloak more carefully and from the office of the generals keep your eyes upon the orators' platform, and not have great pride or confidence in your crown, since you see the boots of Roman soldiers just above your head. No, you should imitate the actors, who, while putting into the performance their own passion, character, and reputation, yet listen to the prompter and do not go beyond the degree of liberty in rhythms and metres permitted by those in authority over them. For to fail in one's part in public life brings not mere hissing or catcalls or stamping of feet, but many have experienced, the dread chastiser, axe that cleaves the neck Plutarch, Moralia, The Precepts of Statecraft[1] Conclusion The Romans were the executives at Roman, Inc. The Greeks were just consultants or engineers. They knew their place, and were oft reminded. Footnotes[1] Plutarch \u2022 Precepts of Statecraft (Praecepta gerendae reipublicae)",

            "answer_text": "\"Barbarian\" is one of many words from all over the world and throughout all periods of history that refer to \"others\" or \"those who can't speak our language\". The meaning of \"barbarian\" (\u03b2\u03ac\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2) changes somewhat through Greek history, but early on, it referred specifically to people who did not speak Greek \u2014 \"bar-bar-bar\" is how the Greeks heard non-Greek language; think of the Dave Chapelle bit \"Ching chang chong I can't understand you!\" referring to Mandarin, or people trying to imitate the sounds of any language they don't understand. An Italian song from the early 70's called Prisencolinensinainciusol by Adriano Celentano provides an example for English. It did not refer to any non-Greek people specifically, but it certainly carried (at first, neutral) connotations of being a non-Greek person. By extension, it also came to mean someone speaking broken Greek, or Greek in a thick foreign accent (\"barbarophonos\"). Bearing that in mind, another important element of the definition had to do with slavery in Greece. In most cities, temporary servitude of Greeks was an accepted punishment for non-payment of debts. In Athens it was banned under Solon, with the argument that all Greeks are equal and free. To replace this lost labor (especially in the dangerous mining industry) they increased slavery of non-Greeks. These \"barbarians\" could usually not easily communicate or understand orders (and there was no organized effort to teach every slave proper Greek), and because language and intelligence were (and are) seen as intimately connected, they were seen as dim-witted and inferior people. What was originally a purely linguistic descriptor eventually expanded as time went on, and the \"barbarians\" became ever more feeble and deserving of their fate, and slavery increasingly justified. This negative view was not universal however, as Xenophon's Cyropaedia shows, where he speaks positively about the history of Cyrus the Great. Alexander the Great (who himself was considered a barbarian by some), during his conquests even adopted \"barbarian\" customs much to the chagrin of his cohorts, and encouraged his soldiers to take barbarian wives. The Romans, for their part, inherited the word largely intact as it was during the Hellenistic period, but substituting the Greek for \"non-Latin\", or \"non-Roman\". The Germanic peoples were certainly barbarians, but it was never used to refer specifically to the Germanic peoples, as the Gauls, Huns, and Carthaginians were equally \"barbaric\". In fact, the term \"Berber\" comes directly from Barbarian. In Rome, as in Greece earlier, the negative connotations of \"barbarian\" were not universal, especially late in the Imperial period when multinationalism and multiculturalism became more common. ",
