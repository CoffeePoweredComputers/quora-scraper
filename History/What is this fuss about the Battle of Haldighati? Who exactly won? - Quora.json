            "answer_text": "The Battle of Haldighati was one of the famous battles ever fought in Indian history. It was fought after the brave Maharana Pratap made it clear to the Mughal emperor Akbar that he would not surrender. When Pratap became the king in 1572, Akbar sent envoys urging him to become his vassal like other Rajput kings had done. However, Pratap did not agree to these demands. He wished to rule independently without bowing to the Mughals. Akbar sent Jalal Khan Qurchi, Raja Bhagwant Das, Raja Todar Mal, and finally Raja Man Singh as an envoy to Pratap. With the exception of Bhagwant Das, no one made any progress. Bhagwant Das presented a robe from Akbar to Pratap which he accepted and also sent his son Amar Singh to the Mughal court. But Akbar was not satisfied by this as he wanted the Rana to personally visit him and bend the knee. Pratap did not agree to this and a conflict became inevitable. When Man Singh was snubbed by Pratap who refused to even dine with Man Singh because he believed that Man Singh had sold his soul to the enemy who in this case was Akbar according to Pratap, it was clear that a battle was inevitable. Man Singh was instructed by Akbar to battle Pratap. He set about this with a huge force which some say consisted of 80,000 men. There is no concrete solid figure but it is clear that Man Singh\u2019s army was significantly larger than that of Pratap. Man Singh\u2019s movements were observed by Pratap and he ventured out to Haldighati so that Man Singh who was on his way from Mandalgarh to Gorgunda could be stopped. It was a brilliant decision on Pratap\u2019s part to force Man Singh to meet him at Haldighati. Why? Because of the following reasons. Haldighati is basically a pass which connects Pali and Rajsamand districts. One who controlled the surrounding hills obtained was at a strategic advantage. Also, the artillery of the Mughals was rendered useless in the narrow terrain of Haldighati. Pratap got the control of the surrounding hills and was aided by a contingent of Bhils whose skills in archery was beyond comparison. In a battle where he was at a severe numerical disadvantage, Pratap\u2019s decision to take the battle to Haldighati was a brilliant one.  What Pratap\u2019s forces lacked in number was compensated by the leaders he had at his disposal. The brave Bhil commander Punja, Ramdas Rathor, Bida Jhala, Pratap\u2019s Prime Minister Bhamashah, and the Afghan commander Hakim Khan Sur who was a descendant of Sher Shah Suri were all outstanding commanders. The battle began on the morning of 18 June 1576. Initial encounters were won by Mewar forces who were being personally led by the Maharana himself. Neither side was willing to budge and if a soldier fell, another took his place before he too fell. War elephants caused havoc and there was blood everywhere. Haldighati actually became Lalghati on that day. Haldighati actually gets its name from the soil that is found over there which resembles the yellow colour of turmeric and this yellow had turned to red by the end of the battle. Despite the incomparable bravery of the Mewar forces, the significant numerical advantage the Mughals had at their disposal paid off. More than 50% of the Mewar soldiers were killed including the commanders Hakim Khan, Bida Jhala, Ramdas Rathor, Ram Sah Tomar, and others. Bida Jhala actually disguised himself as the Maharana and charged at the Mughal forces who launched a full scale assault on him assuming that he was Pratap himself. However, this was a sacrifice of the highest order done by Jhala who saved his king by this act. Maharana Pratap and his remaining men were able to retreat safely. Special mention must be made about the brave and legendary horse of Pratap, Chetak which sacrificed its life but not before taking its master to safety. The Mughals did not chase behind the retreating Mewar forces since they feared an ambush out of the woods which surrounded them and also they knew that the Mewar Rajputs were extremely brave. Why is there so much fuss about the Battle of Haldighati? Because it was one of the fiercest battles ever fought in Indian history. It speaks about the brave Maharana Pratap and those who died fighting for him. It speaks about the loyalty of Chetak which ensured the safety of its master. More importantly it inspires one and all since a kingdom actually had the guts to take on what was probably the most powerful empire in the world at that time. Who won the battle? Of course the Mughal forces did. It was actually a rout for Mewar but did the victory make any difference to the Mughals? No it did not because they failed in the primary objective of the battle. They failed to capture or kill or make sure that Maharana Pratap was neutralised. They did not achieve in making him a vassal of the Mughal Empire. In fact, Pratap against all the odds, despite facing innumerable difficulties against an enemy who was formidable in every way, made sure that Mewar won back the territories it had lost. Except for Chittorgarh, Pratap won back all that he had lost and in a way we can say that the Mughals won the battle but it was a futile victory because till the very end, they could not make Pratap surrender.

            "answer_text": "Who won depends on how you describe \u201cwinning\u201d. Forces of Pratap, which were less in number, had territorial strategic advantage and great motivation. The mughal army had more men and firepower. Mughals wanted to capture or kill maharana and take the free rajput kingdom under his control. When the two forces met, the battle was fierce. But at the end, Maharana lost but managed to make it out of the battlefield alive along with few of his men and forces. He lost great part of his army and control over large territory. After that, he continued his life as a rebel and slowly rebuilt his strength. One by one, he won back almost all of the territory he lost to the Mughals. So I would say, Mughal won the battle of Haldighati but lost on the long run. The fuss about this battle is that now, people, in order to further their political agenda, want to manipulate with history. They claim that the battle of Haldighati was won by pratap. This, in my opinion, is a great insult to the legacy of Maharana. The political parties don't realize that story of Maharana is one that describes valour, sacrifice, determination, perseverance, patriotism and many other great virtues. The loss of battle of Haldighati is what bought out the best in him and is primarily why he is considered a hero. That loss is why generation over generation people have immortalised him. If someone takes away that loss, his story will lose its charm. The old school charm of a hero fighting against great odds singlehandedly and winning. ",
