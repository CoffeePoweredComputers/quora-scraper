            "answer_text": "I can say, without a doubt that Fergie Olver is the worst game show host ever. He and his wife Miss Canada pageant winning wife Catherine Swing hosted 1980s children's game show \"Just Like Mom\" and he flirted with the girls, asked them inappropriate sexual questions, whispered threats into their ears like they\u2019d lose the game if they didn\u2019t give him a kiss on the lips, tried to trick them into kissing him, grabbed them and if all else failed, even when the girls repeatedly said no, he would shoot in and attempt to force a kiss from them. He didn\u2019t even try and hide it. In one video, one of the mothers can be heard calling him a dirty old man as he continued to molest her daughter, his only reaction was a shit eating grin, a glance at his wife and the comment \u201cdid you hear that?\u201d This was his pedophile playground and he was the king. How his wife, Catherine Swing (the actual creator of the game show) could sit by and allow this to continue is beyond me! Would anyone get away with this nowadays?  ",
