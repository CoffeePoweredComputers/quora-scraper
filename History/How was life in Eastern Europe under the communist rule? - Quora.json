            "answer_text": "I can offer a second-hand view from Ukraine, with my western Europe perspective. Most people in cities like Kiev lived in great poverty and over-crowding. Good jobs were rewarded to those who showed most allegiance to the communist party. Children who refused to join komsomol (the communist party youth organisation) were refused access to higher education, which condemned them to the most menial of jobs if at all. One family, probably typical in Kiev, shared a two-bedroom flat (no toilet or bathroom) with two other families, one of which lived behind a curtain in the kitchen. Bribery and corruption of officials was rife. I experienced the legacies of it myself at first-hand when I visited Kiev after independence. Food and household goods were scarce in soviet times. Most shops had little but empty shelves, and whatever was delivered would be snapped up very quickly. I have heard that when word got round in factories or offices of pending deliveries at a shop, representatives would be despatched to queue and buy up whatever they could, to share with their work colleagues. It didn\u2019t matter what was on offer (eg clothes, washbasins, etc) because it could be traded for something people actually needed (eg food). Employers turned a blind eye because it was the way of life for all ordinary people. If passersby on the street saw a queue they would join it, without necessarily knowing what it was for. Ordinary people could never feel secure because their neighbours might inform on them, for engaging in alleged anti-communist activities (eg for simply being critical in a conversation). Informing was often used as a weapon of revenge for an imagined slight, or even by people who were mentally unhinged. Only in the countryside were living conditions bearable, although dachas were usually very small, crude dwellings even by city standards. Even today, people look to authority for reassurance. I have seen menus in restaurants bear what passes for an official stamp and a signature, as if to signify in some way that the food is compliant (with what?). Russians and Ukrainians I have met who grew up under communist rule, have appeared to be very pragmatic and accepting of their lot in life. Most learnt not to question authority. That, in my opinion, is why Putin is so popular now in Russia. State media pump out propaganda and lies, and the people believe it. ",

            "answer_text": "I was 15yo in the time of velvet revolution, so I was shielded from many things. Generally Czechoslovakia was one of wealthier countries of comunistic block, so f.e. shops (incl. groceries) were quite decently stocked, but all items were from one, max two producers, so assortment was very narrow. Still having a garden was very widespread, and everybody tried to grow as much vegetables and fruits as possible. Petrol was quite cheap, so it made (economical) sense to travel 50 km every weekend to your garden (or to house of your parents) and do some farming there. As for schools - it was \u201cnormal\u201d, yes, we had to be \u201cpioners\u201d, this was something like mandatory political organization for kids, I remember swearing something to communistic party, it was quite an event, but for kid it was no big deal\u2026 We traveled two times to summer vacation to Romania and Yugoslavia (Croatia now) with car SKODA 120L. I would be afraid to travel with this car 1000 km today, but as a kid\u2026 I remember also waiting 24 hours on Romania-Bulgaria border, during the trip to Bulgaria\u2026 ",
