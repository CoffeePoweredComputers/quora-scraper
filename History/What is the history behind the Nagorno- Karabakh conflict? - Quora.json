            "answer_text": "The Nagorno-Karabakh War started because the region of Artsakh was 95% ethnically Armenian, but was located within Azerbaijan when it was still part of the USSR. Armenians who were living in the region were unhappy because the Armenian language was not taught in schools, all churches were closed down, and the Azerbaijani government systematically tried to change the demographics of the region by settling Azerbaijanis, Kurds, and Meskhetian Turks while at the same time trying to impose Azeri culture on the native Armenians. The Armenians thought, \u201cwhy are we part of Azerbaijan?\u201d This lead to the \u201cKarabakh Movement\u201d, beginning in 1987 which was a national liberation movement aimed at unifying the Republic of Armenia and the region of Artsakh (Karabakh).  (50,000 people gather in Stepanakert, the capital of Artsakh to demand the region\u2019s unification with Armenia, February 13, 1988) Tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan were high. Armenians began to be massacred all over Azerbaijan, namely in the cities of Sumgait, Kirovabad, and Baku. Azerbaijanis grabbed makeshift weapons and went house to house, slaughtering any and all Armenians in their paths. Armenian girls as young as 12 years old were raped and bludgeoned to death.  (Corpses of dead Armenians in the city of Sumgait after the Sumgait Massacre, February of 1988) Hundreds of Armenians were brutally massacred all over Azerbaijan and the region of Artsakh. Armenians decided they couldn\u2019t be victims of another genocide, and stood their ground to defend their nation. As a result the Nagorno-Karabakh War broke out, with Armenia emerging as the victor in 1994 by liberating Artsakh. ",

            "answer_text": "Nagorno-Karabakh problem started with political reasons rather than today Armenians say that people were not happy to live under Azerbaijan authorities. If it is true, then better ask Armenians living in Baku whether they faced any racist matters or were misbehaved. The reality is leaders of Karabakh Movement (Armenians) were not actually from Karabakh: Levon Ter Petrosyan - born in Aleppo, Syria Vazgen Manukyan - born in Leninakan (Gyumri now), Armenia SSR Movses Gorgisyan - born in Yerevan, Armenia SSR Babken Ararktsyan - born in Yerevan, Armenia SSR Igor Muradian - born in Odessa, Ukraine SSR Yes, there is no doubt that nationalist Armenians always wanted to see Nagorno Karabakh within territories of Armenia and whenever there is opportunity they went to Moscow (in 1940s, 1970s, 1988) and asked for this, which was always rejected by Soviets. I do blame Azerbaijan SSR authorities, because they were not innocent in this matter as well and caused us problems that still we both nations struggle to find a solution. Obviously, leaders of Karabakh Movement (Armenians) had some reasons (thanks to Azerbaijan SSR authorities) and used them on their protests (protests in Yerevan especially. And the slogan was: Karabakh is for Armenians, Armenia is for Armenians). Obviously, this is how our nationalistic mind reacts, in a sudden you start hate each other (Even considering the fact that our nations had tense relations in the past, then it was not difficult to remind this hatred again). Once people started to hate each other again, then initially ethnic and local Azerbaijanis living almost all territories of Armenia (more than 300K people, which was about 10% of the whole country) were deported (started in 1985 and almost all Azeris were forced to leave the country by the end of 1988, early 1989). As a result, authorities of Azerbaijan deported Armenians from Azerbaijan (starting from 1988, ended in 1990\u201391). Once ethnic deportation was completed, then we had only Nagorno Karabakh where people lived together. In the first days, some villages were split into two peaces, where one side was for each. Armenians did not allow Azerbaijanis to use some roads (vice-versa). Hatred reached to the highest level and people actually became ready to kill proudly each other. That is how we went into the war. Authorities in Azerbaijan (in the early days) were politically weak and not powerful compared to Armenians. While we were having a war in Nagorno Karabakh, a group of people had clashes in Baku to get the power, while some commanders (Surat Huseynov etc.) did not take orders from the president (Elchibay at that time - r: 1991\u201392) and rebelled in Ganja against the government with their army. On the other hand, ethnic minorities living in Azerbaijan (Lezgi, Talish) people were politically affected. As a result, government lost the control of almost all territories not only in Nagorno Karabakh but also other places and the president Elchibay peacefully resigned. After H.Aliyev came to the power, he was able to pulverize rebellion in Ganja, Southern and Northern cities of Azerbaijan, but as a result lost the war in Nagorno Karabakh. Armenian forces stepped further and captured 7 more cities outside Nagorno Karabakh as well. Since then we signed an agreement (Bishkek Protocol) to stop military operations and start negotiating, but no improvements was achieved in the last 22 years even though presidents meet 3\u20134 times each year to discuss.
