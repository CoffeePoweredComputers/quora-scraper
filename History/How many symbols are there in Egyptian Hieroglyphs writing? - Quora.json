            "answer_text": "Opinions vary, mostly because it\u2019s not always easy to establish which hieroglyphs should be treated as separate entities rather than just variants on some standard form (just like whenever listing words in English it\u2019s unclear whether you should treat \u201capples\u201d as separate from \u201capple\u201d or \u201cthinks\u201d as separate from \u201cthink\u201d, only in the case of hieroglyphs there are even more factors to consider, such as the time period as well as the size). All in all, we end up with figures that tend to vary between one another by as much as a few hundred percent if not more. But just to give you something to go on, this pisspoorly edited Wikipedia entry on the Gardiner list of Hieroglyphs contains 730 hieroglyphs in each category, although in this case only the primary hieroglyphs are considered. To put it in perspective: I\u2019ve just counted all the hieroglyphs that are listed within the JSesh* databank which includes both the main signs as well as all their possible derivatives and I\u2019ve ended up with 7996. That\u2019s seven thousand nine hundred and ninety-six Egyptian hieroglyphs and so I do believe that a general off-hand reply of \u201csome eight thousand\u201d would not be off point. That also gives us around eleven derivatives per \u201cmain\u201d hieroglyph on average. These 7996 break down into the following categories: A \u2014 841 B \u2014 180 C \u2014 591 D \u2014 513 E \u2014 468 F \u2014 313 G \u2014 459 H \u2014 60 I \u2014 219 J \u2014 34 K \u2014 38 L \u2014 219 M \u2014 362 N \u2014 241 O \u2014 538 P \u2014 214 Q \u2014 76 R \u2014 233 S \u2014 293 T \u2014 240 U \u2014 221 V \u2014 186 W \u2014 170 X \u2014 32 Y \u2014 39 Z \u2014 55 Unclassified \u2014 135 Ff. \u2014 14 NU \u2014 26 NL \u2014 22 Tail Narrow Signs \u2014 777 Low Broad Signs \u2014 99 Low Narrow Signs \u2014 88  So\u2026 just memorize some ten hieroglyphs on every single day for two years straight and boom, you\u2019re good to go. Damn, learning long-extinct languages just couldn\u2019t be any easier, now, could it? *A free tool for writing and arranging Egyptian hieroglyphs as well as easily one of the best text editors of any script that I\u2019ve seen in a while\u2014an absolute must-have for any amateur Egyptologist. And it\u2019s ridiculously user-friendly, even a reanimated mummy would manage. You can find it here, although you may need to upgrade to the most recent version of Java but the setup wizard will redirect you to the proper website anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how far back in time you want to go.   If one were to assume the base of Hieroglyphs discovered in archeological digs at Gerzeh in Ancient Kemet (predynastic Egypt) dating back to about 4010 BCE, we can postulate this to be the recovered inception of the Hieroglyphs we see today.    The predynastic base of Hieroglyphs has about 570 symbols that appear to by Hieroglyphs.  One can clearly see a similarity to early Sumerian Script / Cuneiform with about the same number of symbols.   More modern Hieroglyphs can be thought to have as many as 2900 symbols.  However it is debated if all the symbols are actual Hieroglyphs.    ",
