            "answer_text": "Of course it is wrong but I do understand why some people do it. They want to be part of something bigger than they are and they want to be known and remembered. But it does not make it right. When I was a child, my father was an army intelligence officer and we traveled all over the world. My father loved history so we visited many historical places and monuments. One was a Roman outpost where soldiers had once stood guard. They had carved their names and even pornography into the stone. Along with their graffiti was that of others who had visited the site. There were names and dates from every century. My oldest brother decided to carve his name into history and when my father caught him he said. \"Fools' names like fools' faces are often seen in public places.\" My brother continued adding his name to virtually every public place we visited. I decided to make my own mark by making discoveries and writing books. I think I made the right choice. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course it\u2019s not correct. You are committing a crime and inconveniencing other tax payers and anyone who wants to preserve history. Tagging your name is basically the same as screaming your name with a megaphone in public. People who engage in this behavior are too stupid to realize this one simple fact: everyone hates you and we don\u2019t care who you are. If you want to act like an asshole and write a wise-ass comment or scrawl some doodle, do it in a public toilet where someone might get a laugh and it will just get white-washed. Defacing a confederate monument or a bust of Stalin is different, but just vandalizing a random old building that Hitler lived in is still pretty infantile and pointless. ",
