            "answer_text": "Let me start by saying that I think both answers about taking revenge for attrocities and brutality as a policy are very good. What I do here is I add a bit to them. You should look at the system that created Soviet army.  Russia was a country of terror, but by no means it was a country of order. When you read Gulag Archipelago you encounter the stories of the secret police taking into Gulag an innocent women who just went to the police station, asking for the fate of her brother, next to the story of a guy who was wanted by NKVD but managed to run away, by jumping from the window in his own house during round-up. He moved to the town few kilometres away and for twenty years lived under the very same name - nobody came for him. It was terror without order. When you read about the revolution in its early years - it was bandits who somehow found their communist calling and became comissars - especially in the rural areas. Leaders of local communities were quickly overtaken by the ones who\u2019s biggest power was brutality. As for the army - remember what the revolution did to the officers. In 1917 and then up until 1923 everybody who had experience from tsar\u2019s army was getting murdered. Then, the ones who came after them were killed in the Great Purge.  Almost all of the highest command was murdered. Half of the brigade commanders were killed, 70% of division commanders, 401 out of 456 colonels and about 40 000 other officers. Now, who exactly was supposed to discipline the Red Army\u2019s soldiers? What I\u2019m trying to say is\u2026 Russian army was more of a horde than an army as we understand it, looking at the western organisation of forces. It also came from the organisation of Russian society. Now, communists definitely bestialized people, but it wasn\u2019t only them. Russian society was living in an incredible mental obscurity. To the great extent as a heritage of monarchy - middle class was always rather weak in Russia and nobility was unbelievably detached from peasants and workers. Read Tolstoy or Dostojevsky. Russian dialogue between classes was mostly based on violence or religion. When Napolen attacked Russia, Tsar\u2019s weren\u2019t talking about saving the country, but made pops in churches say he is devil coming for them. Maybe not that surprising in 1812\u2026 But the same did Stalin in 1941. And then\u2026 Then there is the poverty. It was bad before revolution, but terrible afterwards.  Street of Charkow 1932 - people are passing by a man, who died of hunger. Soviet Union was poor beyond belief. If not for the land-lease act, Russian soldiers would go to war bare-foot (not to mention that - in the initial stages - almost without arms too). Soldiers were coming from a society in which you had nothing. No education, no property - several people on a several square meters of a cold hut, hoping to have enough food for everybody to survive next year. Now\u2026 How do you discipline a soldier who by stealing a watch gets more property than he had all his life? How do you discipline a soldier, for whom raping a Polish, German or Hungarian woman is a maybe one and only opportunity to \u201chave\u201d a woman, who\u2019s more or less clean? One, who never in his life has seen city and now can\u2019t believe that his enemies were so rich?  How do you discipline an army of soldiers like that? It\u2019s also jealously that is a good fuel for revenge. I\u2019m hyperbolizing a bit\u2026 But not too much. My grandmother was telling stories about Soviet officers, who made a tea from the same water they were cooking potatoes in. \u201cBecause it all mixes up in stomach anyway\u201d. Yes, brutalization was a tactic, yes it did come from the attrocities made by Germans. But then\u2026 Why did they rape so many Polish women and stole so much Polish property, when Poland was supposed to be their allies? When you look at the history of Russian civil war, following Polish-Soviet war and Russian attrocities during II WW there is a pattern. It comes from the fact that Soviet Army was an horde of poor and neglected, who - in their uniforms - had chance to \u201csteal\u201d a life they were never supposed to have before or after. ",

            "answer_text": "While the answer is technically multi-faceted and has many angles, the simple over-arching answer has roots in the decade prior to the 1940\u2019s. When Stalin began his ruthless purging of a highly organized Red Army in the 1930\u2019s, many of the army\u2019s top thinkers and Generals were either shot, exiled, or simply let go. After a decade of such purging, no one was ready to fight a war effectively when Germany spilled over the border of the USSR, and of all the superpowers, Russia\u2019s troops-what little there were-were the least trained and prepared out of anyone. To defend Russia, the Soviet armed forces were not merely draftees; they were sometimes, literally, factory labors working in slave conditions, rounded up one workday, handed rifles, and marched\u2014civilian clothes and all\u2014down the five or six city blocks and strait into the front lines of combat, expected to charge into tanks and machine gun fire, and shot if they so much as turned back. Such instances were common all across Soviet cities as the fast-moving German Blitz swarmed in on their way to Moscow. While this may be an extreme example of Red Army experience, the \u201clucky\u201d ones who had a few days to be handed a uniform did not fare much better in the war\u2019s beginning, and with all the senior officers with experience having been killed off or worse by Stalin, there was a huge deficit in effective leadership. So; take a near leaderless mass of men and women with no combat experience, already living in terrible conditions, suddenly facing an invasion by one of the most viciously villainous armies ever raised by a first-world power, and forced into combat against an enemy who\u2019s evil is even more open than you own National Premiere\u2014it\u2019s not a pretty picture for discipline or management of troop behavior. Please note, this is not an excuse for Red Army atrocities, just a clinical examination of symptoms. ",
