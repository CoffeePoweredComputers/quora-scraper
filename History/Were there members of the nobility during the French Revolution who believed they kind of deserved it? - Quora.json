            "answer_text": "At the beginning of the Revolution, many Nobles did side with the revolutionaries, hoping for a Constitutional Monarchy. However, when the King was executed and Robespierre rose to power, the majority of nobles fled France to England or Austria. Those that stayed were usually loyal to the Revolution, but by large they were still imprisoned under the Law of Suspects, usually under false terms. After the defeat of Napoleon, some returned to France during the restoration. So, while in the beginning they did acknowledge that change was needed, they ultimately did not believe they deserved to be imprisoned when they initially supported the revolution. ",
