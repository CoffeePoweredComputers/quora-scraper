            "answer_text": "Despite her two Nobel prizes she suffered from discrimination. In the intimation for her first Nobel her name was mentioned only after that of her husband Pierre Curie. After her husband\u2019s death in an accident she had done the work which got her the second Nobel. Rutherford once commented on one of her papers that any undergraduate student can produce work of similar standard. She had an affair with a colleague after her husband\u2019s death which was reason for her being deprived of the fellowship of the Academy of Sciences. She did not take enough precautions to shield herself from radiation which led to her untimely death. Even today her papers are preserved in lead-lined boxes. ",
