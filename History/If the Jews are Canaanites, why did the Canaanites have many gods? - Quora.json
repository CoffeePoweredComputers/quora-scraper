            "answer_text": "\u2026.. Canaanites vs. Judeans? \u2026.. (Jew is misleading.) The advanced, sedentary Semitic Canaanites in c. 3000BC settled & ruled their territory which they called Peleset, covering South Syria, Lebanon, today\u2019s puny Palestine of 21.0k km2; with the state of Israel within its borders, & massive Jordan at 408.0K km2. The Canaanites adopted the Sumerian anthropomorphic theism based on polytheism for all practical matters in 2315BC, at a time, where no 12 tribes, Hebrew or Judaic version of theism existed. The 12 tribes of Sumerians Abram & Sarai of 1800BC beginning with their son Isaac in 1710BC worshipped the Canaanite version, which was the only anthropomorphic version in the Levant, adopted by the Canaanites from the Sumerians, who conceptualized it, eons earlier. The Judaic version of theism would come to fruition in 456BC under Canaanite Priest Ezra in Jerusalem,albeit with a Canaanite Elohe sibling God Yahweh,known to them by their Clergy,only the tetragrammaton YHWH to hide his vowels from the illiterate Judean followers, who well knew the vowels sounds of all 71 Canaanite Gods EL & 70 Elohim siblings. Yahweh is denied until today by the followers having accepted YHWH in 456BC being decreed by Priest Ezra. The ten tribes; Israelites, as subjects of the Kingdom of Israel from 885BC to 722BC only knew the Canaanite polytheistic version, even Abram & Sarai of 1800BC. The two tribes; Judeans, as subjects of the Kingdom of Judea from 796BC to 586BC only knew the Canaanite polytheistic version. The majority of Judean descendants remaining in the majority in Babylon after 536BC, would only of the Judaic God YHWH after 456BC. The minority of Judeans, who trekked to their last capital city Shalim in 536,520 & 456BC knew first of YHWH, as the Judaic God in innovation of monotheism,used to compete with the Canaanite & Greeks religious versions, albeit with a Canaanite God YHWH!

            "answer_text": "Monotheism came slowly over a period of many centuries, with Judaism probably not being fully monotheistic until the time of the Babylonian Exile. When the early Israelites broke away from the main body of Canaanites to form their own, independent community in the cisJordan highlands, they took the Canaanite gods with them. Mark S. Smith says, in The Early History of God: In the Judges period, Israelite divinities may have included Yahweh, El, Baal and perhaps Asherah as well as the sun, moon and stars. ",
