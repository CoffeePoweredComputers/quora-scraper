            "answer_text": "Doug Hensley\u2019s answer was a good one; I won\u2019t repeat what he wrote, but will write on some other points that aren\u2019t often seen. Many of their advantages were temporary ones that they enjoyed at the beginning of the war. Some of those advantages eventually turned into disadvantages. I\u2019ll start with one related to one of the points Doug raised. He raised the point about a longer grazing season in the South, and he\u2019s right. But there\u2019s more. Southern cavalry, especially in Virginia, had a peculiar advantage. That was that the sons of planters quite commonly rode on the hunt. What does this mean? First, they were used to riding on horseback and not just on a plow horse (Yes, I know that one of the great riding horse breeds, the Morgan Horse, came from Massachusetts\u2014Justin Morgan lived about three miles from where I grew up.) They brought their own horses with them to the war. These horses were used to their rider. They were used to being called on to go fast. They were used to the sound of guns, so loud noises wouldn\u2019t bother them, and if a noise happened that did bother them, the rider knew the horse and the horse the rider, and it was possible to calm the horse quickly. Most northern cavalrymen had never ridden a horse before they found themselves in the cavalry. They were mounted on horses that didn\u2019t know them and had never heard a gun fired before. That meant that at the critical moment, the horse was likely to spook, and the inexperienced rider would have all he could do to stay on the horse, let alone fight Jeb Stuart\u2019s boys. Second, horses are not indestructible. Fight in enough cavalry battles and that wonderful riding horse you brought from the Delmarva Peninsula isn\u2019t there any more. You have a new horse that you don\u2019t know and that doesn\u2019t know you. Further, the constant fighting over the same ground in northern Virginia made forage harder and harder as the war went on. In the meantime, the Union boys who were so inept when the war started learned their trade, and they learned it without having a horse they\u2019d had for the last five years, so if they had to go to another horse, it was no big thing to them. Lots of hay could be brought in from Pennsylvania or Ohio to feed those horses. By 1864, those wonderful mounts that had come with the cavalrymen from home were gone\u2014shot or starved. When that is combined with the two-generation jump in weapons quality on the part of the Union cavalry in the course of the war, it becomes huge. Early in the war, Union cavalry were mostly armed with the 1834 Hall carbine. It was a breech-loader, and fairly reliable, but quite primitive. By late 1862, cavalry were increasingly armed with Sharps carbines\u2014still single-shot breech loaders, but much more efficient and much more accurate and reliable. But by late 1863, Union cavalry was armed to a great extent with the 7-shot Spencer carbine (\u201cthem tarnation Yankee carbines you load on Sunday and fire all week\u201d was the way one Confederate described them). Indeed, one of the first units to get the Spencers was Buford\u2019s cavalry division, which was able to hold back a superior Confederate force until Union infantry could arrive; another was Wilder\u2019s \u201cLightning Brigade\u201d, armed not with the Spencer carbine but with the full-length Spencer rifle, also a 7-shot repeater. Wilder held a gap essential for the Confederates to contest the Union advance in Tennessee in the summer of 1863, and then, at Chickamauga, with much of the Union army fleeing, his brigade counterattacked against Longstreet\u2019s flank, generating so much firepower that Longstreet and his staff wondered where the Union had come up with another corps! Wilder broke off his counterattack when it became necessary to cover the retreat of the fleeing units toward Chattanooga. By late in the war, most of the Union cavalry had Spencers. Having a Spencer was just short of having a semi-auto rifle. Boom. Click. Boom. Click. Boom. Click.Boom. With semi-auto, you just don\u2019t have the Click.One thing that was very double-edged was that the Confederate soldier, from the end of 1861 (they initially came with a considerable amount of pack that most of them discarded), carried much less in his pack than did the Union soldier. It wasn\u2019t at all unusual for a Union soldier to be carrying 50 pounds or more of pack on him\u2014his rifle, ammunition, rations, a change of socks and maybe of shoes and of underwear, a tent half, a spade. I know what I carried in the Army and it was a lot less than what a Union soldier in that war carried, and it was no picnic. Imagine that you\u2019ve suddenly gained 50 pounds and then been asked to run, jump, tussle with an enemy soldier hand-to-hand, or even to stand up quickly. Against that, the Confederate soldier was likely carrying his blanket, some very skimpy rations, and his ammunition, and not much else. He was not nearly as weighed down as the Union soldier facing him. Sure, if the Union troops got to a place where they could take some of the pack off, they did\u2014but that wasn\u2019t always, and if you found yourself under fire when you were carrying all that pack, well, then you didn\u2019t have time to unpack. For a time that simply meant that Confederate soldiers could run faster, jump higher and farther, and fight with better coordination than the loaded-down Union soldier. But by 1864, that meant that the Confederate was barefoot, tattered, nearly starving. Traveling that light didn\u2019t look so good any more. In the meantime, the Union troops were fed, shod and supplied. The poor Confederate skeletons mixing it up with the Union troops at Five Forks were a sad remnant of the confident boys who\u2019d gone off from home to fight at Bull Run.There was in the east a temporary edge for the Confederates in the quality of weaponry. The Union arsenal at Springfield had produced some 35,000 rifles from 1855 on. (See production records, Springfield Armory.) About half of them were issued to US Regular units. In 1860, Buchanan\u2019s Secretary of War, John Floyd, ordered that those rifles that hadn\u2019t actually been issued be moved from the arsenal at Springfield to the arsenal at Harper\u2019s Ferry. (See Grant\u2019s memoirs.) Also, many of the 1842 model smoothbore muskets had been rebored to be rifles instead of smoothbores, increasing range and accuracy. Many of them were moved to southern arsenals by Floyd\u2019s orders. Grant, in his memoirs, magnanimous as he was in victory, waxed quite bitter on what he did consider treason on Floyd\u2019s part, using his office in the US government to arm the South while he still had authority to do so. When, at the beginning of the war, the Confederates seized some 17,000 Springfield rifles at Harper\u2019s Ferry (see Clifford Dowdey\u2019s introduction to The Wartime Papers of Robert E. Lee), they were getting almost the entire reserve supply of Springfields that the US Army had. Given that most of the Regular units were out in the West manning forts against the Indians, that meant that there were more Springfields being used in combat by the Confederates in those first months than there were by the Union. The great stand by \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson\u2019s brigade at Bull Run makes all the sense in the world when you know that the commander of the Confederate force that seized Harper\u2019s Ferry was Thomas J. Jackson, later to be known as \u201cStonewall\u201d. I have been to the Bull Run battlefield and looked from the place where the Stonewall Brigade made its stand. It is wide open for hundreds of yards. Up there on that hill, they were picking off Union soldiers as soon as they started advancing, getting off 3 or 4 volleys before the Union attackers (except for one battalion of Regulars) could engage. And yes, when the Union army broke, it was the Regulars with their Springfields that kept the Confederates at bay so that the rest of the army could flee pell-mell to Washington. The early Confederate advantage in small arms was compounded by the efforts of both sides to buy Enfields in England. The CSA representative got to England before the USA representative did, and got first dibs on hundreds of thousands of Enfields. By the Peninsula Campaign, Lee\u2019s army was quite nicely equipped with Enfields and those Springfields that had been taken at Harpers Ferry. Also, there was a smaller manufacturing capability at Harpers Ferry; Jackson had the machinery transported to Richmond, where rifles that were to all intents and purposes the same as the Springfields were made (just not as many as Springfield was making).Southern state militias had also been arming up for quite some time, even before it became clear that secession was in the offing. The \u201cMississippi\u201d rifle, so named because a Mississippi regiment (commanded by then-Colonel Jefferson Davis) carried them in the Mexican War, was in use by a couple of Mississippi regiments and by one Alabama regiment (the 4th). A couple of South Carolina regiments had been equipped with British Enfield rifles. A number of Georgia militia regiments had, before the war began, bought a Connecticut-made knockoff of the Enfield, the Whitney rifle. And in all this, the Union was scrambling to match what the South had done. It was really at Antietam that the Union units for the first time had finally all been equipped with rifles. In the west, there were more Confederate units that were well-armed; on the other hand, there were more Confederate units showing up with flintlocks and squirrel guns; Union units, even if they didn\u2019t have rifles, had the Model 1822 or Model 1842 muskets\u2014not as good as a rifle, but a lot better than a squirrel gun made by your local gunsmith. Still, at Vicksburg, when the city fell, many of Grant\u2019s units swapped out their 1822\u2019s and 1842\u2019s or rebored muskets for better weapons that they captured (see Grant\u2019s memoirs).The South had a potential advantage that they never really used. That was interior lines. It should have been easier for them to move troops from one theater to another than for the North, even given that their rail lines were fewer and not as good as the North\u2019s lines. But Jefferson Davis\u2019s strategy was to set up departments with clear boundary lines, which the department commanders guarded jealously. It hurt the South repeatedly that various department commanders refused to send troops from their department to another. The Union manpower advantage at Gettysburg could have been completely nullified except that the Confederate department commander refused to release any of the units in his department to Lee. (Ransom\u2019s division and Corse\u2019s and Jenkins\u2019s brigade of Pickett\u2019s division; the Union numerical advantage was about ten to fifteen thousand; the five brigades involved had some 12,000 men. Given that some 13,000 of the Union troops were in the VI Corps that arrived only fairly late in the battle, and most of them never even fired a shot in anger, Lee would actually have had an effective manpower advantage all through the second day).Ultimately, all the advantages on which the Confederacy could call were nullified by one man\u2014Jefferson Davis. Ironically, it was he who as Franklin Pierce\u2019s Secretary of War had had Springfield convert its production from smoothbore muskets to rifles\u2014as Springfield got up to full capacity, it was Davis\u2019s improvement there that was arming the Union. But far more serious was Davis\u2019s constant interference with the military operations of the Confederacy and his maintaining in their positions the people he considered personally loyal to him; perhaps the most disastrous being Braxton Bragg as commander of the Army of Tennessee. This, too, had started off as an advantage for the Confederacy. Davis had been a colonel and a regimental commander in the Mexican War. He was a West Point graduate. So he had a great deal more military knowledge than did Abraham Lincoln. While Lincoln was still learning his military ABC\u2019s, Davis was able to respond to the various issues around him, especially in Virginia. But that temporary advantage for the Confederacy turned into an advantage for the Union. Lincoln KNEW the limits of his knowledge and abilities with regard to things military. He tried to help his generals in whatever way they requested. (George McClellan went over the line with his absurd demands for enormous hordes of reinforcements.) Better to have a man who knows nothing and knows that he knows nothing than a man who knows a little who thinks he knows everything.",

            "answer_text": "The South had several advantages at the time of secession. Let\u2019s start the clock before the shelling of Fort Sumter. (1) They might have forborne to shell it. The North wasn\u2019t entirely set on war to preserve the Union. One Southern politician, Robert Toombs, even warned against firing on the fort. That swarms of otherwise peaceable Yankees would swarm forth and sting the Confederacy to death. It was an option. It occurred to them. Had they chosen wisely, their chances would have been immeasurably better. The advantage that the North was ambivalent about fighting, or just letting the erring states go, was squandered. (2) They might have forborne to invade Kentucky. The short term advantage was that it gave them the chance to set up some forts that obstructed navigation on rivers the North would need to supply any offensive against the western portion of the CSA, and it gave them the prospect of recruiting legions of Kentuckians from a fellow slave state that was wavering and might back the apparent winning horse if they got off to a good start. The long term disadvantage was that once again, whoever first resorts to violence loses the sympathy of many bystanders. KY came into the war squarely on the Union side, notwithstanding the fact that the CSA was indeed able to raise a handful of regiments there before things fell apart for them in KY. And then Grant had to go and mess things up by capturing the forts. (3) Even after these massive blunders, they had both some real advantages, and some advantages that were illusory but might have helped them diplomatically before foreign powers realized they were illusory. The illusory advantage was that the CSA was as big as European Russia and just by virtue of its size impossible to invade and conquer. There simply was no historical precedent for how mass armies, which would be needed, could be supplied. (That was illusory because the existence of railroads had changed everything, and because the Union had the possibility of gaining control of the Mississippi which would afford them easy supply routes with which to support a campaign to sever LA, AR, and TX from the Confederacy.) One real advantage was, as others have already observed, that they didn\u2019t have to win the war to get their way. They just needed to exhaust the patience of the Northern public. But they squandered this advantage by adapting a policy of too-active defence. This cost them dearly, as even their offensive victories were a bad bargain considering the extent of Union manpower. Another real advantage was that they might have accessed their slave population as a military resource, offering manumission for one year\u2019s satisfactory service and counting death or disabling injury during service as valid for the manumission of a family member. Yet another real advantage was that the grazing season was longer in the South which meant that they had an edge in mounts when it came to cavalry. They also had an edge in riders as more Southerners were good horsemen. But as we go down the list, the advantages fade in weight and permanence. They had top leadership not remotely so capable as that provided by Lincoln and his cabinet. They hadn\u2019t nearly so many men, so much manufacturing, so much money, nor the technical ingenuity of the North. They weren\u2019t slouches, not by world standards, but sorry, the Monitor was invented and built in the North, as were repeating rifles. Once they squandered their first two advantages, their chances were poor. Thank God. ",
