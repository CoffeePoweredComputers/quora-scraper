            "answer_text": "Well, we really did stumble into a hornets nest full of hate and Hellfire now, didn't we? Of course the obvious reason is for disambiguation. If, you called airmen and Sailors, \u201csoldiers,\u201d nothing would ever get done, because they'd keep sending in soldiers. But, in the interests of comparison and disambiguation, let\u2019s look at the chart: We are a dept. of the NavyWe are and elite amphibious fighting force indoctrinated in maritime warfare.We are the smallest branch of service, because we are an elite fighting force. (Basically, it takes fewer of us to get the job done.)Since, our funding gets handed down by the Navy, we get way less funding for weapons, gear and everything else.The Army has many different M.O.S.\u2019s for jobs. Our main function is fighting. So, you're either a grunt or supporting the grunts.We don't even have our own medics. The Navy assigns us Navy Corpsman. (Whom we promptly douse with whiskey, torture, interrogate, humiliate, brainwashe and then finally indoctrinate into our cause.Every Marine is first trained as an 0311 (Read as, basic rifleman or grunt)Marines don't start off as Marines in bootcamp. We start of as recruits and must earn the title of Marine.If you get out of any other branch of service and cross deck to another, you'll be expected to go through basic training again. Unless, you're a Marine.Our enemies have nicknames for us that we like to call each other: Teufel Hunden, aka. Hell hound or Devil Dog, Leather necks, Jarheads, Shock troops, Yellow legs, Americans 911, and my favorite \u201cOHSHITRUN!!!\u201dWe are the official guards of the President and American Embassies world wide.The Marine Corps Band is the only official band of the President.We are the Presidents only personal 911. By Presidential order and with out Congress and without declaring a state of war, he can send us to fight anyone, anywhere, at anytime and we will be there within 24hrs or less. Or, you can have your country back for free and the next assault is on us.Marines are steeped in military history and Marine traditions from bootcamp and expected to be America's little torch barriers of history and customs. If you ask a Marine what Smith the purpose of a particular implement on there uniform, you will get a detailed history of the name, purpose, significance, and history of it. If you as someone in the Army, they will probably look at you like you're a weirdo. (By the by the birth place of the Marines was Tun Tavern (a bar!!), Philadelphia, Nov. 10th 1775. The first recruiter was the bartender.We have the strictest standards and punishments. My head hurts now, but the list goes on and on to infinity\u2026 Hope this helps. All of the answers I have seen are basically correct. But, I love this one the most: We stole the rope from the Army, the anchor from the Navy, the Eagle from the Airforce. And on the 7th day, while God rested, we OVERRAN HIS PERIMETER, STOLE THE GLOBE AND WE'VE BEEN RUNNING THE DAMN WHOLE SHOW EVER SINCE. ",

            "answer_text": "Because they are not soldiers, they are Marines. 200 years ago when wooden ships fought hull to hull these crazy bastards swung over and fought hand to hand. They were also responsible to repel boarding of the other crew. They fought in maritime battles, on a marine platform and therefor they are marines. In addition you could not just BE a marine, you had to be a specialized, professional combat trained member of the crew and VERY fit (as you can imagine) and very good with a sword (at the time) and so these were very expensive special forces. Its important to note that in contrast ANYONE could be forced to be a sailor or soldier because the country said so. Marines always were a special force. They were called leathernecks, because they wore leather around their necks to keep their throats from being cut from behind when they swung over into the middle of the opposing crew etc\u2026 The movies always portray sailors as doing all the fighting, they did not. We maned the cannons and maneuvered the ship and managed damage and repair, the marines did the fighting and escorted landing parties. ",
