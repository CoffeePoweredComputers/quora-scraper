            "answer_text": "The dynamics in macroeconomic environment would completely change if financial market crashed again.1. Financial market serves the economy. Economic growth requires the general success in firm-level investment projects, which needs funding. A functional financial market is supposed to channel the funding and make sure the resource allocation is efficient.2.  Unemployment. This would definitely affect everyone. When the healthiness of the entire macroeconomic environment is damaged, unemployment problem is almost inevitable, in every industry. You want and need a job, right?3. Sentiment. A crash can easily result in the loss of belief in the entire economy and the bad sentiment can last even longer than the problem itself. Panic is hard to fix.4. Economy and crime. Well, the findings about the association between those two are mixed so I don't want to reach here.5. Public welfare is largely funded by government revenue, which primarily comes from the taxation. Crashed financial market->bad economy->less tax collected-> deteriorated welfare (remember the times government shut down and nobody was taking care of the restrooms in national parks?) ",

            "answer_text": "As others have mentioned, a crashed stock market has negative effects on the economy and as a result on individuals. Whether you have savings, or are invested or not, having roads that are paved, bridges that don't fall down and a police force can be useful for the average citizen. You may spend your entire life working for a living. Trading time for money. I hope you don't. There is a lot to be said for having capital work for you. It creates time for many people, not just Billionaires. A retirement fund creates time when you are older. A college fund creates time for young people to learn and explore. Savings accounts allow time for leisure. So for the overall happiness of society, it is worth paying attention to the capital markets. The stability of money flows and the predictability of interest rates are valuable for a Society that wants to create time for its Citizens to spend as they like. Profits and returns are just one piece of the puzzle. It is not necessary to invest and take market risk to be rewarded by a well functioning marketplace.  The Society as a whole benefits when there is a balanced allocation of time between Labor, Leisure and Charity. A well functioning Stock Market provides capital for growth and jobs (labor) and earnings for consumption and leisure pursuits and the ability to direct excess capital to the Charitable interests of your own choosing. Best wishes on using your time as you like. If you have any leftover after work, it is probably a result of a capital market. ",
