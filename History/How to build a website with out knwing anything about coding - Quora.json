            "answer_text": "There are two ways to do it: Using a CMS (Content Management System)Using Site BuildersThe choice depends on what kind of website you are building. CMS is an application that runs on any server and allows you to create, store, search and manage content that are usually stored in databases. These applications provide an admin panel from where we can manage our contents. CMS provides reasonable abstraction to the working of the entire system so that anyone (developers and non-developers) can make use of all the functionalities of the CMS. You might need to get familiar with their admin panel to make full use of it. CMS is used if the site you are building contains a lot of dynamic content. Some well known CMS are: WordPress.com: Create a Free Website or BlogJoomla Content Management System (CMS)Drupal - Open Source CMSWebsite Builders make it easy to build a website on the website builder's hosting platform (Unlike CMS you don't have to worry about hosting). They are easy to use as long as you have a slight idea about how a website should look and what are the different UI elements. They usually provides a drag and drop kind of workflow which allows you to design a website much faster than with CMS. These site builders do not provide high flexibility since they are used to build a particular type of website and the functionalities to be added are limited to those in the builder's hosting platform. They are used mostly for building static sites but some of them offer content management limited to some type of websites. Some of the well known Site Builders are:Wix.comWeeblyShopify",

            "answer_text": "If you want to make a website by yourself and avoid coding, then I can present TWO options: \u2022 Use online builders, price is ~ $130/year \u2022 Use CMS (content management system), price is ~ $50/year I want to emphasize that in 2017 creating a website is a piece of cake and beginners can definitely do that. So, which one do pick (builders or CMS)? You don\u2019t need coding with either of them but Google views them both as a code because Google bots are robots and they only see the code. In case of builders \u2013 the code is not so search engine friendly\u2026 it means that builder\u2019s code is not so crawlable as is with CMS and thus \u2013 you have more work to do in order to get top positions on search engine results page. So, I recommend using CMS. Building with them both is similar: just drag-and-drop elements, like putting bricks together while playing with Lego\u2019s.
