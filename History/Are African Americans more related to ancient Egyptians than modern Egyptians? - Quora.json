            "answer_text": "Absolutely no. African Americans have nothing to do with ancient Egyptians. The ancestors of African Americans (the classic ones, black people with Negroid features) were shipped from the Western coast of Africa to America. This region is very far from Egypt and has not much to do with ancient Egypt genetically, linguistically, or culturally. Meanwhile, modern Egyptians are clear descendants of ancient Egyptians, only mixed with immigrants/invaders from the Arabian peninsula. But these two groups were already very similar anyway. (same language family, similar appearance etc) ",

African americans come from specific tribes of equatorial west and central africa that at no point had any connection with anything above the sahara. ",
