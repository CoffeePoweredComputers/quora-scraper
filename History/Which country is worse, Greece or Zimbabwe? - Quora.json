            "answer_text": "Let's look at Inflation Firstly, Zimbabwe in no longer in hyperinflation. In fact Zimbabwe is now in deflation. In January 2014, the CPI was 100.48. In January 2015 it was 99.19. The inflation there was minus 1.28%. In April 2014, the CPI was 100.89 but in April 2015 it was now 98.22. Inflation there was minus 2.65%. Now lets look at Greece at the same periods. From January 2015 - January 2014, inflation was minus 2.84%. And from April 2015 to April 2014 inflation was minus 2.11%. When you look at the stats between the months of January & April you will see inflation in Zimbabwe declining consistently and that in Greece has been rising consistently. Right now Greece's inflation is higher than that in Zimbabwe.But of course, at it's peak, Zimbabwe's inflation was peerless. Inflation went so that between 2007 and 2009 that the government effectively abandoned it's own currency in February 2009 and started using foreign currency. Everyone else stopped using the Zimbabwean Dollar then. When you compare Greece today and Zimbabwe then, Zimbabwe was worse. I was living in Zimbabwe at the time and here are some things we experienced: Everyone was a millionaire but they were poor. We quickly got used to dealing with big numbers. I was in college at the time, cash-strapped but I had quadrillions in my bank account.It got so difficult to count at the time that the Central Bank had to remove zeros from our currency 3 times - a process called Redenomination. The final redenomination produced the \"fourth dollar\" (ZWL), which was worth 100 000 000 000 000 000000 000 000ZWD (first dollars). The long number is 10 to the power 25.Zimbabwe's peak month of inflation is estimated at 79.6 billion percent in mid-November 2008 but that's just an estimate.We got to a point where prices would change multiple times in the same day. If you walked in a bar to buy six beers, you would buy all 6 at the same time because the price was likely to change after you finished drinking the first.The Central Bank put withdrawal limits so you could only withdraw a small fraction of your the money in your account during the day. One way I tried to get around that was to open multiple bank accounts. In 2008, I had accounts with 13 different banks.For most workers, the money you got paid was not enough to last you the whole month. It became more profitable to spend your in bank queues than it was to go to work.Here are some pictures to show what it was like then:                                 Sources http://www.rbz.co.zw/about/inflation.aspInflation Greece 2015Hyperinflation in ZimbabweZimbabwean dollar",

Do you really think every nation in the world is more  concerned about people of Greece?We are just concerned about our own people and the economies they run.Zimbabwe is in despair but it hardly matters to the world.We are all selfish you see. :) ",
