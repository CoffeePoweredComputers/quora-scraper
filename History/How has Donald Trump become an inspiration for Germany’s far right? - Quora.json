            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think he became an inspiration, but he certainly is a poster-boy for pretty much everyone that mistrusts or outright hates the German government and the idea of a modern, liberal and progressive society that most Germans like to think of, when they think about Germany. Since these often irrational \u201chaters\u201d don\u2019t have many friends in Germany, they look for other figures to get validation, and the US president, influential and powerful as he is, seems like a natural ally: Trump hates immigrants - German right-wingers hate immigrants.Trump denies the danger of the COVID-19 pandemic - German right-wingers deny the danger of the COVID-19 pandemic.Trump hates Merkel - German right-wingers hate Merkel.Trump hates liberals - German right-wingers hate liberals.Trump likes Putin and other autocrats - German right-wingers like Putin and other autocrats.Trump likes law and order - German right-wingers like law and order.Trump likes to play the strong leader - German right-wingers want a strong leader.Trump supports right-wing conspiracy theories (QAnon, AntiFa and BLM \u201cterrorists\u201d, the Islamization of Europe, just to name a few) - German right-wingers like to believe in conspiracy theories.And the list goes on. Now, what makes this so special is not Trump himself, who would just be another strange US president to us, but the frequency and the severity of his dividing and hate-mongering us-vs-them rethoric, the sheer scope of his lies, which makes them almost believable again, and the fact that millions of Americans still support him, which creates the impression that also in Germany, there might be a rather large number of people who think exactly like he does, but who are afraid to go public - the myth of the silent majority. If Trump gets support, his policies get support, and since so many of his ideas overlap with those of the German far-right, they feel supported aswell by proxy, and turn him into some kind of leader-figure, not only of the German far-right, but the global far-right movement in general (which he arguably is). TL;DR: The German far-right has little support in Germany, so they have to look elsewhere for validation, and Trump is a good poster-child because the US president is very influential, shares their ideas, and 100,000,000 Americans still support him and give weight to his opinions, policies and conspiracy theories. Like we say in Germany: 100,000,000 flies can\u2019t be wrong - sh*t must be delicious. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s this: Why has Donald Trump become the new symbol of the German far-right? Trump is now the cover-boy for the Nationalist International. He represents the sort of atavistic identitarianism that values hierarchy, obedience, and uniformity. There is a huge swathe of the American population that yearns for this. It\u2019s palpable. They feel it in their hearts. Encountering diversity, free expression, and egalitarianism is, for them, upsetting to the point of traumatic. Hence their reaction. Europe suffers their presence as well, perhaps more so. We in America tend to see Europe as comparatively progressive in almost every aspect of life. We don\u2019t see the reactionaries. For many of us, it\u2019s a mystery why an authoritarian like Trump would resonate within Europe at all. But the plain fact is that the same xenophobia we see in our country has existed in Europe for a very long time. Arguably it was imported into the New World as part of the Europe\u2019s dark side. Americans took this preexisting condition, and encouraged it to metastasize. Our indigenous people might make that argument. Trump has exposed this cancer. Authoritarians across the globe recognize this sickness as their own, and so he is celebrated. There really is no mystery. ",
