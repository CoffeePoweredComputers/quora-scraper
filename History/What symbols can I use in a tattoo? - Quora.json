            "answer_text": "What ever the hell you want! It's YOUR skin. It's YOUR body. Nobody has got to look at it but YOU. If they dont like it they can look away. Don't let anyone tell you that YOU can't, or shouldn't, HAVE that on YOUR body. I don't give a rats ass if it's offensive to any certain group of people. They need to get over it. It's freedom & this world needs to get over tryng to control everyone. But just remember if you put it out there for everyone to see, be shocked by or even disgusted by it you have to give the SAME RIGHTS TO EVERYONE ELSE. None of this \u201ccalling the kettle black\u201d. It's an old term look it up. As for certain symbols I've found that Symbols.com is very helpful * and this is has nothing to do with style or any of the other advice I've given on tattos in other posts. ",
