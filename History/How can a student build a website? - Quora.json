I'm using ASP.NET MVC5 and all its related technologies such as Entityframework, Ninject, MySQL and all the rest to build it.  I'm really not worried about the domain, webhost and all those stuff during this stage... I started out with the use case diagrams, domain diagrams, just to kinda have all the requirements sorted. I'm not worried about the requirements changing, I'm using Agile Development. Developing in sprints.  I'm a student and that's how I'm building my website. I hope you can relate brother... #100 ",
