If, as a Serb, you have nothing better than to harass and try to convince your Bo\u0161niak neighbor of a Serbian lecture of his own antagonist historical beliefs, you have quite some face. This, non withstanding what is true and what is not. Surprising then, that you can have such face\u2026 face to face with your neighbor, and yet ask the question as an anonymous on Quora, where no one will be able, obviously, to punch your face. That contradictions leaves me very suspicious on you being who you pretend to be. That suspicion is reinforced by a few other elements : you define yourself as \u201cSerbian\u201d and not \u201cSerb\u201d (that happens at time on Quora),but more weirdly, you confuse \u201cBo\u0161niak\u201d with Bosnian (that last part is typically Clintonian propaganda, Bosnian is a nationality, not an ethnicity and no Serb will make the confusion ; so is Serbian by the way).So, in my opinion, OP, you\u2019re just either a trashy Ottoman leftover who\u2019s trying to launch a curved ball through a Quora question in order for some public vindication to fall on the Serbs, either an even more trashy Westerner who should read a bit more and write a bit less. In any case, you don\u2019t the basic requirements to do so though : a mastery of the Serbian alphabet (it\u2019s Karad\u017ei\u0107, not Karadzic, idiot), or local ethnonyms, and of simple logics which the conjunction of your question and anonymity undoubtedly betray.

            "answer_text": "You can try to argue, but I wouldn\u2019t bother as people nowadays redefine words to suit their argument and then refuse to acknowledge they\u2019ve done so. Different conflict (I don\u2019t know a lot about the conflict in the Balkans during the early 90\u2019s, other than it was basically fighting over very old grievances, I\u2019m sorry), but I\u2019ve basically given up on trying to explain that, although I\u2019m opposed to the Zionist rule in Israel and their expansion tactics, I can\u2019t really fault them in dealing with the Palestinian insurgence. Saying \u201cyou can\u2019t come within x-number of metres of our military patrols or we\u2019ll shoot you.\u201d and then shooting people who come closer anyway is not genocide. The Palestinians deliberately not clearing combat zones of civilians, even though they\u2019re officially at war with Israel, is not the Israeli\u2019s fault, etc\u2026 but it just bounces off of these people who fall hook, line and sinker for these victim tactics, because they want to pretend to be better humans than me. Therefore, when I see misinformed opinions nowadays, I pause, breathe and move on. I just don\u2019t have the energy to waste on people who refuse to look at events objectively. ",
