            "answer_text": "SPAIN People seem to always forget about Spain but I\u2019m gonna make my case here why Spain\u2019s history should be if not the best always considered between the top countries. First of all say that human settlement in Spain traces back millions of years.  The greatest empires and military forces through western history have played a role in Spain. Since the greeks and who set colonies all through the Spanish Mediterranean coast. Followed by the cartaginese and the romans. The Punic wars were fought partly in Spain. Anibal, Cornelius Scipio and Julius Caesar all fought battles in Spain. Spain was actually the first outside of Italy country invaded by the romans and all almost the last to be fully conquered. Taking the conquest of Spain 200 years in comparising to the 7 years that took for Caesra to conquered the Gauls (France). During the Middle Ages Spain was the most develop European country both culturally and economically under the reign of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba. Famous Al-Andalus. La Alhambra is just one prove of it. All through the Middle Ages Spain was the battlefield of the two main religions Christianity and Islam, with plenty of wars back and forward. La Reconquista. No such country had the divide and coexistence of the Christian-Islamic world in such way. It was under Spanish expeditions were much of the \u201cnew world\u201d was discovered. Spain was the First Nation to arrive to America, and the one that influenced more in the continent as a whole. Spain introduced horses, cows and the Christian religion to America, and bringed back tomatoes potatoes and tobacco to Europe, so no smoking and ketchup and fires w/o Spain. Also it was a Spanish expedition the first to circumnavigate the globe. Fun fact, Australia was discovered by the Spanish and its name references to the Austria\u2019s, the royal dinnasty ruling at Spain at the time. Also Los Angeles, San Francisco, Colorado, Florida and plenty of more US cities or states names are Spanish because colonization of Spaniards. Not to mention that Spanish is the most spoken language in the world behind Chinese (too many Chinese) and English (international language). During the same period Spain was the greatest power of Europe, having the Netherlands, most of Italy, Portugal, Central Europe under their control. It was against the Spaniards that the Lutherans and the reformers of religion rise. Spain was at the same time fighting against France, England, Ottoman Empire, Lutherans and Protestants all through Europe (Swedish,dutch,germans\u2026) and conquering and colonizing the American Continent. Most of the famous pirates actions were against Spanish ships, the famous pirates of the Caribbean were mainly that. It was at Spain were Napoleon was first defeated, being his military stoped by the tactic of guerrillas warfare. During more modern times, Spain lived anarchist and communist revolutions, being the only Western European country to having a communist government under the influence of Stalin during the second republic and Spanish Civil War. During this same war Spain live also the arguably only anarchist successful revolution. George\u2019s Orwell Homage to Catalonia is a great book that refers to this concret event. Also almost all of anarchist thinkers and organizations study and pay tribute to the Catalonian revolution. Nazi armies clashed against soviets in Spain during this war. Being a preWW2, were many of new military tactics were first introduced. After the civil war Spain lived a dictatorship until the year 1975. In more recent history Spain is a NATO member and part of the European Union. So Spain can say that the greatest powers of western history, the Greeks, Romans, Muslims, Napoleon, Soviets, Nazis and now the US, having military bases in Spanish territories, all have been present in Spain, something that no order country can say.  Greek theater of Merida  The Roman Aqueduct of Segovia.  The Alhambra of Granada. Symbol of Al-Andalus   Map of the Spanish Empire   This picture is not Moscow or East Berlin, that\u2019s Madrid during 1938  Also Spain during the war. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few countries that fit the bill for me here! England- There's proof of habitation from prehistoric times. It has such fascinating prehistoric and monolithic sites like Stonehenge. Successfully beat back the Roman Legions, even under Julius Caesar, for a century before being successfully invaded, but even then the island was never fully and successfully subjugated. Has a line of kings that dates back to the time of the Roman retreat from Britannia. Evolved from a kingdom, to a monarchy by divine right, to a democracy\u2026 with the monarchy still intact. Became the British Empire. So large and vast it was the empire on which the Sun never set. It is the source of culture, language, and common law for other influential and powerful nations that are still employed today like the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Stood alone successfully for quite some time against Nazi Germany. It is still a influential country today, as well as being powerful militarily and financially. Japan- It's the oldest and longest civilization in CONTINUAL existing that is still in existence today, with dates varying based on the criteria for the founding of the civilization. The Japanese monarchy is also the oldest hereditary monarchy in existence with 126 hereditary emperors starting in 660 BC. Japan has never been successfully invaded and conquered, even despite being the only country in the world to have been subjected to a nuclear weapons\u2026 not once, but twice. (Yes, it surrendered to, and was occupied by, the United States after WWII. However, the United States did not invade and conquer the nation. Also, the only condition of the Japanese surrender was that the Japanese Emperor keep his throne, which he did\u2026 and the Emperor still holds his throne to this day.) Religiously, it has always been fluid and open, accepting different religious practices. That its people adhere to the cultural and social protocols has been the mandate and point of conformity, not religious hegemony. It gave birth to warrior classes like the Samurai, built around a unique code of honor and service, while also giving birth to such things as Zen Buddhism and Shintoism, seemingly paradoxical, yet harmonious. My personal favorite: if you fall asleep at work, you are not in trouble or frowned upon, quite the opposite, it is considered a point of personal honor and loyalty to the company! Here's how they look at it: if you fell asleep at work, it's assumed that it's because you are so dedicated and working so hard for the company, that you must have worked to exhaustion and fallen asleep! So they let you be! Mongolia- Simply because, seemingly out of nothing and nowhere, it gave birth to Ghengis Khan and the Mongol Empire. It was the largest empire, by land mass, to ever exist at, and up to, that time. The Mongol Empire's legacy effected countries (and their histories) from China, to Russia, to India and Afghanistan, and everything inbetween. The success of the Mongol Empire can be seen in the legacy of the man who started it all\u2026 Ghengis Khan. He fathered so many children, that vast populations in Asia can be genetically linked to him to this day. He is believed to be the most successful, as far as by simple procreation, man in history by number of direct descendants. Any country producing a man and empire like that is most definitely worthy of study. The United States of America- Despite its somewhat ragtag beginnings, its seeming non-importance at the time and continuing into a good portion of modernity, and its implementation of, for the time, an experimental and unique form of government, it possesses an extremely interesting history full of unique events, world firsts, and improbable actions powered by a combination of shear will and blind luck! It went from 13 colonies of the world's largest empire, often consumed with infighting and differing interests, to what is now the world's most influential and militarily powerful country\u2026 from vehemently isolationist to active and involved worldwide. It managed navigating being part of a powerhouse to being the powerhouse. ",
