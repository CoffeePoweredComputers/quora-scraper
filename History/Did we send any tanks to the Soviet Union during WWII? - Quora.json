            "answer_text": "The Allies sent tens of thousands of tanks to the Soviet Union during WWII under lend-lease programs. The Soviets very much appreciated this because the American Sherman tank was equivalent to the German Panzer Mark IV and could hold its own in a tank battle with them. It was also much more reliable and repairable than any of the German tanks. The Sherman only fell behind because later in the war the Germans introduced the Panzer V Panther and Panzer VI Tiger after they ran into the Soviet T-34 tank during their invasion of the USSR. The T-34 was far superior to anything the Germans had, so the Germans had to upgrade their tanks. The problem the Germans had with the Panther and Tiger was that the combined Allied tank production (T-34s and Shermans) was an order of magnitude (10x) what the Germans could produce. An often overlooked contribution is that Canada built 1420 British-designed Valentine tanks, and sent about 1400 of them to the Soviet Union, retaining only a few for Canadian use. It also built thousands of American-designed Sherman tanks, but suspended production when it became apparent that the US could build far more Sherman tanks than would ever be required in the war. They shipped many of them to the Soviet Union. Canada concentrated on building army trucks, and built more than 800,000 of them, which was more than Germany, Italy, and Japan combined. The vast majority of them it gave to Britain and the Soviet Union, and retained only 170,000 of them for its own use, which gave it one army truck for every 3 soldiers. This meant that the Soviet Union could concentrate on building T-34 tanks because its allies could supply it with all the trucks it needed. The Germans were completely overwhelmed by Allied tank production, nevermind army truck production. They had to rely on horses for transportation, whose only advantage was that when they ran out of food they could eat the horses. Nikita Khrushchev, who was an intermediary between the military commanders and the political rulers WWII, and later Premier of the Soviet Union said, \u201cI would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were \"discussing freely\" among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war.\u201d The famous Soviet Marshal G.K. Zhukov is quoted as saying: \u201cToday [1963] some say the Allies didn\u2019t really help us\u2026 But listen, one cannot deny that the Americans shipped over to us material without which we could not have equipped our armies held in reserve or been able to continue the war.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The Allies did send tanks to the Soviets during WW2 as part of the Lend Lease Program. Most of the tanks that were sent were reasonably well liked, some were hated, but most of then were used, often due to the desperation of the Soviets. The British sent Tetrarch Light Tanks, Churchill Infantry Tanks and Matilda Infantry Tanks but the most notable tank they sent was the Valentine Infantry Tank. Note that a large number of the Valentines were sent from Canada.  Criticisms include their relatively slow speed and weak guns, but the British Lend Lease tanks were generally well liked for their Armour and reliability. The Americans also sent multiple types of tanks most notably the M3 Lee and the M4 Sherman. The Americans would also send M3 Stuart Light Tanks to the Soviets.  Soviet Shermans Fun fact: The first Soviet armoured units to enter Berlin used Sherman Tanks. Technically that means that American Tanks were the first to enter Berlin. The M3 Lee was disliked by the Soviets who at the time already had the far superior and more modern T-34. The tank was unpopular to the point where the Soviets gave them the nickname of \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0445 which translated to \u2018Common Grave for Six\u2019. Other monikers include \u2018Grave for Six Brothers\u2019. There were aspects of the Lee that the Soviets liked most notably the transmission, differential and final drives, and the steering and brake mechanism. The M4 Sherman on the other hand was much more well liked by the Soviets. The tank was comparable to the T-34 when it came to combat performance, but it was a much taller tank and thus much less cramped and more comfortable to fight in. There were stories of guards being posted for Shermans due to the fact that infantry soldiers would loot the artificial leather on the seat coverings of the Sherman so that they could make boots. The Soviets liked the reliability and armour quality of the Sherman and considered it less prone to an ammunition detonation. There were issues with the tank most notably that due to it\u2019s height, it had a much higher centre of gravity making it more prone to tipping over. It should be pointed out that the Soviets gave the Shermans the nickname of \u2018Emcha\u2019. This wasn\u2019t related to its performance and popularity but more because of the fact that the open topped figure 4 resembled the Cyrillic letter che. The M3 Stuarts that were sent over were severely disliked by the Soviets however. The Tank was considered to be severely under-gunned, and lacking in armour. They were also considered to be too sensitive to fuel quality and complicated logistics due to the fact that the Stuarts used high octane fuel while most Soviet tanks used diesel or low octane fuel. Another problem the Stuarts had was their two manned turret and high fuel consumption rate, limiting their potential in combat and reconnaissance roles. The narrow tracks of the M3 Stuart led to a much higher ground pressure, resulting in them sinking in the often wet and muddy terrain of the Eastern Front. The Soviets would later try the American M5 Stuart and reject them. Given their opinions of the M3 Stuart, this is quite reasonable. So yes, the Allies sent a huge number of tanks to the Soviets to assist them in the war effort. Most of them were reasonably well liked, some were hated but all of them played a part in the war. ",

So with that said, I'll answer your question by saying yes, but that's only if I guessed right and you're either American or a citizen of the UK., as I dont know of any other country that might have sent tanks to the Soviet Union during WWII. Wether or not it was something that should have been done wasn't really debatable at the time since the world was dealing with someone that was every bit the equal of Stalin in many ways, and the Soviet Union was certainly needed to help defeat this man known as Hitler and his ideology which was a greater threat in that time period than Marxism. In any case, you'll also learn a bit about all of that in that history classes I mentioned earlier. Cheers and good luck in your future education! (assuming you are taking advantage of public schooling in either country) ",

The Russians called it the \u201cGrave for Seven Brothers\u201d, It was too tall, had a useless 37mm gun in the turret, the 75 mm bow gun was hard to aim, it had a riveted hull that would launch broken rivets into the fighting comparment when hit by a shell, and it caught fire easily. Thousands of M4 Sherman tanks were sent to Russia, The Soviets replaced the inferior American 75mm main gun as quickly as hey could. The Shermans tracks were too narrow for Russian snow and mud. The armor was poorly designed and poorly hardened. ",
