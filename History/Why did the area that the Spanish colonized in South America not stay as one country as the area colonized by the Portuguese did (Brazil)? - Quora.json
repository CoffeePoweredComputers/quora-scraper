            "answer_text": "Spanish South America was already divided in four major administrative regions:Viceroyalty of Nueva GranadaViceroyalty of PeruViceroyalty of Rio de la PlataGeneral Captaincy of ChileOnly Chile remained united, mostly due to its isolation from the rest of the territories. Several political processes made that Nueva Granada divided among Colombia and Venezuela. Per\u00fa splitted in Per\u00fa, Ecuador and part of Bolivia. R\u00edo de la Plata in Argentina, part of Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay. In each former Viceroyalty can be clearly analyzed the reasons that drove to the regarding divisions. The liberation process, the representation forms and intentions, centralized vs. decentralized decision processes, egoism. I know better Distances didn\u2019t helped to a regular communication. Joining delegates from all areas took months, when there still was no government formed, but provisional formas, that degenerated into attempts of local control of the whole.Brazil was already a single unit as Portuguese Viceroyalty, and, later, as Empire itself, when the Portuguese Emperor ran away from Europe. This helped to a sense of unity, mainly when the whole neighborhood was Spanish, and a political and military opposing force.Geography also had y meaning in this. Most of the old Brazil developed itself mostly in the Atlantic coast, and rowing up by the biggest rivers, like the Amazonas. It had for long time not much depth in the continent.",

            "answer_text": "So, short answer because I don\u2019t know a lot about the history of Spanish America: from what I\u2019ve read, part of the reason was because while Spanish America was separated into smaller administrative units, which had some independence between themselves, and stayed divided until the time where the fights for independence from the Spanish empire started (some of them became more than one country); Portuguese America was divided in small administrative units called \u201ccapitanias heredit\u00e1rias\u201d for a short time only (this administrative system failed miserably there), which were soon united into only one administrative unit. Because of this ( and also because the independence process there didn\u2019t change things too much, since the heir of the Portuguese crown became emperor of Brazil, and things happened mostly pacifically), when Brazil became independent, it was a unitary state (though nowadays it\u2019s a federative state). An interesting point to consider here is the history of the USA, too. Like Spanish America, though before it, the 13 colonies became independent, but were separate from each other; the difference is that they united afterwards, becoming a federative state. ",
