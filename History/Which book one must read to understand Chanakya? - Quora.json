This novel goes back and forth between current India and India around 2000 years back when Chanakya was @live. And this happens among chapters while one chapter deals with current India next chapter deals with India 2000 years ago. Being a thriller every chapter ends on a high note but when you enter next chapter you are in different context altogether.  ",

            "answer_text": "There are many books with the name \u201cChanakya\u201d in their titles - Chanakya\u2019s Chant, Inside Chanakya\u2019s Mind (and others by Radhakrishnan Pillai ). Though these are good books, they are in no way related to Chanakya. So, these are the books that you should skip. Now coming to the books to read, start with \u201cArthashastra\u201d (Published by Penguin. I have read this so I know that it is good). You can also read \u201cAge of the Nandas and Mauryas\u201d by A. Nilakanta Sastri and \u201cChandragupta Maurya and His Times\u201d by Radhakumud Mookerji. These are academic books and are only meant for serious readers and those interested in history. For children, I would suggest reading books published by Amar Chitra Katha on Chanakya. ",
