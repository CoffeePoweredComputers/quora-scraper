            "answer_text": "\u201cWhich Bible verses made you an atheist?\u201d There were many verses that, combined, caused me to think the Bible could not be the word of God. Here are a few examples, and explanations as to why they convinced me the Bible is not the word of God, and that it is written by ancient primitives: James 1:13-15 New International Version (NIV) 13 When tempted, no one should say, \u201cGod is tempting me.\u201d For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; 14 but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed. 15 Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. The above is contradictory, and exposes the god of the Bible as not very smart. If God designed humans, he is the reason they have desires to begin with. So, God actually is tempting people in a roundabout way. He also created the temptations (ie. The Fruit of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, etc.). The authors of the Bible fell far short of perfection when inventing their god. The reason this verse exposes the biblical god as unintelligent, is that any thinking person who is God would say, \u201cSince I cannot be tempted by evil, and do not tempt others, and since I am designing angels and men in my own image, I will create them so that they too are not tempted by evil, and so they will not tempt anyone. If my character does not allow me to sin, then I will make it a part of angel\u2019s and mankind\u2019s nature to not be tempted by evil, so that sin, death, and suffering will not enter the world I created, and I will not have to dish out death, suffering, and eternal torture. Their character will not allow them to sin, and they will be just as happy as I am about not wanting to sin.\u201d That God does not do so in the Bible is the result of the fact that evil does exist, and there must be some way to account for it when creating a God. If you invent a God that does what any thinking person would do, he wouldn\u2019t be compatible with the obvious facts about life and suffering. Here is another passage that makes me doubt the Bible is the word of God: Matthew 5:18-19 New International Version (NIV) 18 For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 19 Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. The Law is morally atrocious, as depicted in the Old Testament, and would land people in jail if they actually obeyed it. Here are a few more passages that cause me to doubt the Bible: Revelation 14:11 New International Version (NIV) 11 And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever. There will be no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image,or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.\u201d Matthew 25:46 New International Version (NIV) 46 \u201cThen they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.\u201d Mark 9:47-48 New International Version (NIV) 47 And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, 48 where \u201c\u2018the worms that eat them do not die, and the fire is not quenched.\u2019[a] Why do these bother me? I have thought deeply about what it would be like to be the one who burns in Hell forever, and the thought of it happening to anyone, even my worst enemy, fills me with empathy, which is love. I cannot accept that infinite torture is ever acceptable morally. I consider it a sick and twisted thing to do, a thing that is infinitely worse than death, a sin of such magnitude it is the worst sin that could ever be committed, an infinitely evil abomination. I cannot accept that God is a monster who kills everyone who ever lived, even children, and then brutally tortures almost everyone on Earth forever. Most of all, it is the books of Genesis and Exodus that cause me to think the Bible must indeed have been written by ignorant ancients. There was never any Adam and Eve, or a fist human, according to evolution, which has been observed, and is therefore a fact. There was also never any Moses. He is a fictional character, and the stories about him are not true. There is simply no evidence where there should be mountains of it, and there are no records indicating the story is true where there should be many. ",

            "answer_text": "Still in elementary school I was starting to doubt things. Brought up in a household where justice was important, and being naive by nature, I was wondering why do so many people and animals die such tragic deaths they did not deserve - where is the justice in that? I love cats, and I\u2019ve witnessed little kittens being run over by cars and my first cat get killed and tortured by the neighbour\u2019s dog when I was 6 years old, as the neighbours did nothing to prevent or stop it from happening. As a child it brought me a lot of pain as I didn\u2019t get WHY did these things happen to INNOCENT living beings. I started turning to religion, prayed every night for my family and pets to be ok - so I started reading the Bible, a special edition for kids. The quote that set me off was: Genesis 1:26 Then God said, \u201cLet us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.\u201d As I\u2019ve been reading the description of the sixth day, I remember thinking \u201cARE YOU KIDDING ME?! You\u2019re telling me that an animal\u2019s life is worth s**t??? You\u2019re preaching that men are entitled to the whole planet, to do what they want with everything? I hate this!\u201d and just closed the book and never continued reading. Also geography had some influence over my thoughts on heaven and hell. Like, where is this guy and why has noone seem him if he\u2019s just above us? How can he hear and keep track of so many people praying at the same time on this huge planet?  For many years I\u2019ve considered myself an atheist. It was a huge struggle as I was still in high school during this time and had noone to turn to for a meaningful conversation, spent my whole teenage years wondering what is even the meaning of life and should I just die and get it over with, and also didn\u2019t believe in destiny - how I wished some things were avoided and that they weren\u2019t meant to be. At 20, I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t care anymore. So now I\u2019m an apatheist. I have found many other reasons as my purpose for living - e.g. people I care about and art. As for destiny, I try not to think about it. ",

That\u2019s like asking what passages in the Wheel of Time trilogy (or better yet, the half dozen \u2018continuing adventures of Al\u2019Thor and friends\u2019) made you an atheist. Get this, if Bible verses are deemed to have any authoritative influence over your theological position on the existence of God, you have to regard them as evidence for God. Otherwise, they are simply books that you regard as having only what truth value is in them by accident. People are atheists because they don\u2019t want to believe in any God, not because they happen to disbelieve in a particular scriptural tradition. Anyone that believes in the God of the Bible is disbelieving in the divine portrayals of the Koran or the Vedas or whatever. Heck, the majority of people who believe in the portrayal of God in the New Testament have a habit of disbelieving in the God of the Old Testament. Everyone believes the truth claims of some \u2018scriptures\u2019 and disregards the claims of others. There are various atheist scriptures (or rather, writings basing their truth claims on the assumed superiority of atheism of some sort or other). If a person found a passage in an atheist work that, to them, definitively established the truth claims of that work, and thus the claims of atheism, that could make them an atheist. But finding your proof of the non-existence of God in one of the many claimed divine scriptures which put forth variant and incompatible ideas about God is intellectually unserious. ",

Judges 11 30 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, 31 Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD'S, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering. 32 So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands. 33 And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel. 34 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter. 35 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back. 36 And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon. 37 And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows. 38 And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains. 39 And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel, 40 That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year. Holy Bible.King James Version How many devout theists have read that ? ",

            "answer_text": "As a child, I read \u201cbible stories\u201d avidly, and never questioned the existence of god, until I started thinking about the story of Noah and the great flood, at the age of 6, when I began reading books about geography, geology and meteorology. I realized that the story of Noah could not be entirely reconciled with the emerging knowlege of the history of the world. This undermined the idea of biblical infallibility, which was promoted by the religion I was being raised in. Discovering that \u201cBible scholars\u201d calculated that the Earth was only 6,000 years old was the last nail in that coffin. Either all of science was wrong, or at least part of the Bible was. The debate wasn\u2019t really even close. The existence of god vanished, in my mind, with the discovery and splitting of the atom. If god created the world, and the \u201cword of god\u201d was written in the Bible, then how could there be no mention of atoms in the book? I recalled Santa and the Easter Bunny, and realized that adults routinely lie to children, in order to control their behavior. Since Easter bunny and Santa were proven to be fables, why should god not end up with them in the rubbish bin? On reflection, the so-called \u201cpassion\u201d of Christ seemed like nothing but a mythic exposition of a political murder, transformed into martyrdom for chiefly political purposes. It wasn\u2019t until I went to college that the Biblical rug was pulled out from under religion. There, I learned that the Bible was a compilation of ancient texts from many sources, which had been revised, translated and reinterpreted many times. Entire \u201cbooks\u201d had been added and removed at the whim of religious authorities. Divinely inspired \u201cWord of God,\u201d really? What god? Apparently just another fable. Caveat emptor. ",

            "answer_text": "These are amongst the verses that made me realize that no all-loving God could have written this kind of stuff. Leviticus 20:9 If anyone curses his father or mother, he must be put to death.Exodus 35:2 For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a day of sabbath rest to the Lord. Whoever does any work on it is to be put to death.\u2022 Ezekiel 18:13 He lends at interest and takes a profit. Will such a man live? He will not! Because he has done all these detestable things, he is to be put to death; his blood will be on his own head.When men fight with one another, and the wife of the one draws near to rescue her husband from the hand of him who is beating him, and puts out her hand and seizes him by the private parts, then you shall cut off her hand. Deuteronomy 25:11-12Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man intimately. But all the girls who have not known man intimately, spare for yourselves. Numbers 31:17-18On slavery;Exodus 21:20-21 \u2013 \"If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies as a direct result, he must be punished, but he is not to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two, since the slave is his property.\"On rape:Deuteronomy 22:28-29 - \"If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered, he shall pay the girl's father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the girl, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives.\"On hating your family;Luke 14:26 \u2013 \" If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters\u2014yes, even his own life\u2014he cannot be my disciple.On killing children;Hosea 13:16 - \"The people of Samaria must bear their guilt, because they have rebelled against their God. They will fall by the sword; their little ones will be dashed to the ground, their pregnant women ripped open.\"On adultry;Genesis 38:8-10 - \"Then Judah said to Onan, \"Lie with your brother's wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to produce offspring for your brother.\" But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so whenever he lay with his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from producing offspring for his brother. What he did was wicked in the LORD's sight; so he put him to death also.\"And adultery again;Leviticus 20:10 - \u201cIf a man commits adultery with another man's wife\u2014with the wife of his neighbor\u2014both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death.\u201d",

            "answer_text": "God calls for child sacrifice: Genesis 22: 1\u201310 1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. 2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. 3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. 4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. 5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. 6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. 7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? 8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together. 9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. 10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. EDIED TO ADDRESS COMMENTS: It is typical to explain away this horrific passage by explaining that God was \u201ctesting\u201d Abraham and the very next describes the angel staying Abraham\u2019s hand with the knife in it, so obviously, God wasn\u2019t actually going ot go through with the test. There are multiple defects with these proffered apologetics. First, why did an all knowing god need to test Abraham? He already knew the depth of Abraham\u2019s faith. Second, why was Abraham not surprised when he got such a gruesome request? Why didn\u2019t he say, \u201cWHAT DID YOU JUST ASK ME TO DO???\u201d We know that that Abraham could question God\u2019s commands and bargain with God. He did exactly that just before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Yet, when asked to sacrifice his only child, it\u2019s no big deal, not a hint of resistance or doubt. My guess is that Abraham had no doubts because such a command could be reasonably made by the god worshipped by Abraham\u2014 a bloodthirsty god demanding child sacrifice. Next, nobody addresses Isaac in this situation. We know Isaac is old enough to assist his father and to infer that something important is apparently missing in the planned sacrificial event. WE also know that Isaac didn\u2019t participate voluntarily in the process \u2014 he had to be tied down. What was going through Isaac\u2019s head at this time? Love, contentment? How about abject terrror as he sees his father reading a knife to slay him. There are suggestions that perhaps Abraham and Issac knew that god would intervene. If that was true, the entire thing was a mere charade and not an example of Abraham\u2019s faith because he knew there was a \u201cking\u2019s X somewhere. No matter how this episode is analyzed, the god demanded child sacrifice and inflicted extreme cruelty on Abraham and excruciating cruelty on an innocent boy. ",

            "answer_text": "I suppose this question comes from people like me stating repeatedly that this or that Bible verse contributed to their atheism. It was a lack of Bible verses, really, that lay at the centre of my deconversion. I searched the Bible, the hymns, the sermons\u2014anything I could lay hands on\u2014to understand what in the universe changed when Jesus died to make it possible for human souls to get into heaven. If I can forgive all the horrible things people have done to me without so much as an apology, then I know an almighty all-knowing merciful and loving God can and will forgive without anyone\u2019s death unless it was absolutely necessary. An ancient Jewish custom of animal sacrifice did not justify the crucifixion. An all-knowing God could have come up with some means of salvation that made sense to Ancient Israel as well as late-twentieth-century people. The foregoing were my convictions, the only thing that made sense. That a dead body could somehow aid living human souls did not make sense on any level, not for me when I was a small child in the middle of the 20th century, nor when I was a theology student in the early 21st century. As in Plato\u2019s forms, the spiritual is superior to the material; the dead body of Jesus was a physical body, material. Somehow, I knew all of this as a seven-year-old child. Yet Christianity said Jesus died so we could get to heaven. I trusted Christianity. I trusted my parents, teachers, and preachers. I knew of no other way to think of the universe, of human life, of death. Everything I had access to had a Christian slant. It was the way my brain had been taught to operate. But there was always the Contradiction. I could not rest until I had peace with it. I lived as Christians were supposed to live. Paul said that would bring peace. Isaiah said God would give peace. Jesus said the new birth would be mine. None of these things happened. Not until I disobeyed all the rules and took my life\u2014and eternal salvation\u2014into my own hands. It was the scariest thing I ever did. I don\u2019t think I could go through that again. It took months, years, the best part of a decade to truly recover from the trauma. Just writing about it causes my heart to speed up. That\u2019s how traumatic it was. It was worth it. No where in the Bible does God or Jesus or Paul or Moses or anyone for that matter write the answer I searched for. Yet Jesus promised in many different verses that all we had to do was ask and pray, and we\u2019d get what we needed. Doesn\u2019t work that way, my friend, not if you actually need something and it isn\u2019t on the menu. Why God created me this way is not a question I ever got an answer to, either. ",

            "answer_text": "After a lifetime of being a committed Christian, albeit with inner questions, one very familiar verse suddenly hit me. Right upside the head. Actually, it irreparably smashed my faith wide fucking open. Ready? Acts 1:9 \u201cAnd after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were looking on, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.\u201d Aka, the Ascension of Jesus. A sudden, unbidden, blasphemous thought came to my mind. So where did he go, outer space? I tried to force that thought to go away. But more came. No seriously, where did he go? Did he freeze to death at a certain altitude? Lose oxygen? Go behind a cloud, are you kidding me? You think Heaven is behind that cloud? That is an ANCIENT view of the world, and you are okay with this?! It was a shocking revelation at the time. I felt like I temporarily turned into the Gollum/Smeagol twins. There were definitely two sides of me fighting on the inside. I am now an atheist. The war is over. ",

I became an atheist because I traveled around the world for 22 years and during that time I learned about many different religions. The more I learned about various religions, the more I realized that they don\u2019t make sense. The fact that your question is focused on the Bible is proof your perspective is massively restricted. You believe the Bible is the one true scripture; however, please try to understand, people of other religions believe the Bible is not the true scripture. I became an atheist for two reasons: Religious people suffer from tunnel vision and refuse to accept the fact that their religion is no more credible than believing in Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy.Science\u2026",

But reading the Bible, I saw contradictions in the start with Genesis 1 and 2. This alone told me the Bible is not inspired from God but fiction written by men. Sure some parts may be real but so many more are not. It is RIDDLED with historical inaccuracies, with contradictions, with impossibilities, with scientific inaccuracies, and with the main character (God) an abusive, narcissistic ogre who commits heinous acts and demands others do so as well under the threat of extortion. But hey, anyone who has NOT read the full Bible (pick your version) wouldn\u2019t understand this. They read (or just get told of) only the cherry-picked parts taken out of context. ",

            "answer_text": "Which Bible verses made you an atheist? Reading the Bible was just the start and at the beginning, it wasn\u2019t a particular verse or verses but rather overall ideas. At one point, well after I\u2019d left Christianity, I read through a lot of biblical inerrancy debunking, but that was more along the lines of curiosity about a subject that no longer had much emotional resonance beyond memory. The ironic aspect of this question is that for every biblical error and mistake in fact that I\u2019ve seen pointed out, I\u2019ve read apologetics (Christianity advocates that specialize in providing rationalizations for why the Bible is as it is) that offer explanations for why they aren\u2019t errors. When I was a believer, the apologists seemed very persuasive. But the deeper, more convoluted notions about the nature of morality were the sticking points for me. ",

God supposedly commanded Adam and Eve not to partake of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil and the Tree of Life. Eve, charmed by the snake, ate the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge and then convinced Adam to do the same, thus supposedly disobeying God\u2026a \u201csin\u201d. OK, so first, getting past the whole talking snake thing, let\u2019s consider Adam and Eve\u2019s \u201csin\u201d. God did not want Adam and Eve to gain any knowledge of good and evil, the theological thinking being that if they gained that knowledge they would eventually sin and no longer be able to dwell in the presence of a perfect God. And therein lies the crux of the whole thing\u2026prior to eating the fruit, Adam and Eve HAD NO KNOWLEDGE. James 4:17 clearly states that knowledge is necessary for an act to be classified by God as \u201csin\u201d. The verse states that you have to KNOW that what you are doing is wrong. Absent any knowing, the direct inference is that the act is NOT a sin. Prior to eating the fruit, they could not have known that what they were doing was wrong. So, the argument goes, \u201cBut God told them not to eat, so they knew.\u201d If that\u2019s true, then God violated his own command to them and provided them with knowledge of good and evil, thus invalidating the command not to eat because he had already given them the very knowledge he didn\u2019t want them to have. Finding one error just led to contemplate the myriad other contradictions and very shortly thereafter, voila, one more atheist. ",

And the similarly ignorant verses of all the other scriptures I checked out. But all that is metaphorical, right?  Right! Scriptures are for the most part cutesy ancient literature. Merely good reads. A window on the past. All educated people agree they are not factual. (Or, do they?) What really made me an atheist is coming - or not coming - to grips with people who actually believe some of these ancient myths. Like, for example, the \u2018incarnations\u2019 or \u2018arrivals\u2019 of gods like Krishna, Dionysus, and Jesus. Or the resurrection of Osiris after having his body cut to pieces and scattered all over Egypt. Or the one about the young man-god who had to die a heinous and humiliating death in order for our sins to be forgiven even though he had already been forgiving sins before he died! Stories like these are nothing more than fairy tales for adults. ",

If the context was unclear or the words misunderstood, the material is imperfect (as is to be expected when humans are the authors, regardless of the inspiration involved) and the deity that is so concerned about people following these particular platitudes has decided to do nothing to address these problems.

I always wondered at the Ten Commandments which tell us god is jealous and then in the next breath tell us not to covet. Also the idea that such a supreme being would need us ant-like humans to worship him bothered me even as a child. I made an aquarium but I don\u2019t give a good crap if the fish in my aquarium praise me. On a more serious note it was really the judgmental Christians in my church fervently waving and quoting from a book whose origins were most certainly self-serving for the members of the early Christians in Greece and the church in Rome. They quote verses written in Greek translated to Latin, rewritten in English, and then again in modern English as if they are the exact words of God to justify their positions. Also the pervasive anti-intellectualism of many evangelicals put me off the whole thing. I have read the Bible three times in my life and there is really no one verse that made me resign from being a Christian. I imagine that is because the Bible is not meant to be taken verse by verse but rather passage by passage. ",
