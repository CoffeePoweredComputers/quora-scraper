            "answer_text": "Yes, Definitely\u2026 I have been meditating for a few days and my crave for food is already decreased. Eating more food results to indigestion. I am eating now a days only once a day or sometimes twice a day\u2026and I don\u2019t feel weak. The scientific reason may could be the decrease in oxidation process in your body\u2026because your mind is calm and it doesn\u2019t need much energy and thus the body also needs less energy. I used to wonder how people in the cave were able to live and meditate so long without eating any food. And here is the answer. Meditation decreases your mental stress, mind work and makes your body still. The just opposite happens when you are exercising and loosing up your energy..The more you work out, the more heavy food you need to sustain your body. Their is increase in breadth rate and their is vigorous oxidation process going on in your body. Similar process to that of meditation happens if you smoke Marijuana regularly. Marijuana is known to be a spiritual booster and it brings the similar effect that of Meditation. Your mind become calm and your body processes slows down a little bit. If you observe, the people who smoke marijuana regularly tends to eat less and thus become slimmer. Hope this answer is satisfactory. I am writing from my experience. Good luck. Meditate and stay blessed. ",

            "answer_text": "After actively meditating and learning about it for around 4 years: I don\u2019t think it works like this. Moreover, keep in mind that our bodies need certain amount of nutritions to function properly. However meditation trains your mind, so by gaining mental strength I experienced that I can resist eating junk food and food full of sugar way more easilyI can easily resist overeatingI can easily stick to eating a certain times (I don\u2019t do late-night-snacks anymore)I can handle hunger without getting irritated. Didn\u2019t have time for breakfast? No problem anymore.So meditation can help to develop a mindset for healthy eating an resist stress that comes from temporary hunger. ",
