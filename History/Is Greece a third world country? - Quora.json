            "answer_text": "I used to believe this at some point of my life. However, we have to look closely what a third world country is: First World. USA and its allies. Greece has good diplomatic relations with USA, and also supported South Korea during the Korean War. No doubt, Greece is a First World state.Second World: USSR and its allies. Greece was never, ever, a communist state, even though there\u2019s a lot of communist people in Greece. The Greek civil war between Capitalist and Communist was 1\u20130, although some cities have streets named after Aris Velouchiotis. (google him)Third world: Neutral states.Some people however use the term \u201cThird world\u201d for poor, undeveloped nations, such as the ones of Africa. Greece is indeed very poor, but not as poor as Uganda or Djibuti. We have however: Bad school infastructure, and this is why lots of Greek kids hate school  There\u2019s no seperation between church and state, the Greek Orthodox Church is free of taxes, corrupt, full of selfish, hypocrite and racist bishops. Even if Christianity is about love and friendship. In fact, during the Covid pandemic, many bishops said that people shouldn\u2019t wear masks on churches.  Bad transportation infastructure. Trains are bombed by graffiti, there\u2019s no other line electrificated other than Athens-Thessaloniki and some suburban routes, Thessaloniki Metro is taking ages to be completed, most of Mailnand Greece has modern, safe highways but Crete doesn\u2019t.    Our monuments are damaged. Parthenon, for instance, was bombed in Ottoman years and still to this day looks like it was nuked.  Our politicians are stupid. If you watch our parliament discusions, they always fight whenever they have different opinions  Women\u2019s rights? Have you ever heard of Mount Athos? It\u2019s the Christian version of Saudi Arabia.  Don\u2019t make me even talk on the poorly translated signs    On the good side, Greece took good measures when Covid19 pandemic reached its land, and only during the summer when there were tourists everywhere, the cases rose. Not even USA took such measures. I think a better term to explain Greece is a \u201cBanana republic\u201d, and is no surprise to me. We grow bananas on the coast of Crete and I\u2019ve seen them and elsewhere as ornamental plants.\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. Greece has streets, electricity, clean running water , airports, phone and internet services, harbours. The vast majority of Greeks , especially those born after the \u201880\u2019s , have a university degree and speak fluently at least one or two foreign languages. Most of the Greek people own at least one house , most Greek families have two cars. Greek people have showers daily!!! All Greeks have access to technology such as internet and mobile phones. At some point Greeks bought a new mobile phone every 6 months!!! Luxurious hotels are everywhere in Greece, tourism is a major source of income for Greece. There is at least one museum in every city. Would millions of tourists visit Greece if it were a third world country? Greeks are avid readers and they are also movie goers and they attend many theatre performances. Over 100 theatre plays are performed annually in Athens alone. Greek people love art. There are many cultural and folklore art museums in Greece. Thesalloniki was the cultural capital city of Europe some years ago. Would that be the case if Greece was a third world country? Medical conventions are held in many cities of Greece every year. Some of the best hospitals of the Balkans or even Europe are in Greece. 9 year education is mandatory in Greece. Everyone has access to public education. The Greek governement provides all children with free education. Even universities in Greece are free of charge. Greek schools might not be perfect but many scientists have gone to Greek schools. There is democracy in Greece. People are free to elect their own governments. There is no censorship. Women can vote, can work, are treated equally, have access to education , are given job opportunities. Greece is definitely NOT a third world country. ",
