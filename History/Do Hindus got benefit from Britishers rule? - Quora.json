            "answer_text": "Yes, if you consider covert barbarism to be superior than overt barbarism. Religious discrimination changed from overt barbarism of Islamic rule to covert barbarism British Rule British didn't directly destroy temples or attack Hindu Dharma except during the 1857\u20131859 struggle for independence. They, however,let loose Christian missionaries to convert all Hindus to Christianity. During debates in British Parliament pro-conversion MPs in fact gave Christian conversion as the main reason for British rule. This policy was changed after the 1857 explosion, also known as 'The first war of independence'. Our education system would not have been in such a mess without British rule. The traditional education system was proscribed by the British and replaced by an English medium western style system made to order for slaves which has made some Indians literate but possessed with no critical thinking. Economy British Rule According to the late Professor Madison of Cambridge University India's share of world's wealth declined from 22.5 % in 1820 to 2 % in 1947. it was British policy and not individuals which impoverished India. The scale of the looting can be estimated by looking at the fact that India which accounted for about 25 % of the world economy at the beginning of British rule in the early 1800s collapsed to about 2-3 % of the world economy in 1947. The reason for the current backwardness lies in the systematic deindustrialization of India in the 19th Century by the British colonialists. The late British historian Eric Hobsbawm writes in his book, 'The Age of Revolution 1789-1848' that India became a 'market for Lancashire cottons: in 1820 the subcontinent took only 11 million yards; but by 1840 it already took 145 million yards. This was not merely a gratifying extension of Lancashire's markets. It was a major landmark in world history. For since the dawn of time Europe had always imported more from the East than she had sold there ....' The Age of Revolution 1789 - 1848 by Eric Hobsbawm Such a policy of turning entire populations into paupers was also of course adopted by people like Hitler during war times but not in peaceful times. The late Cambridge Professor Angus Madison has published his estimate of the world share of Indian economy. You will get some information here: Timeline of the economy of the Indian subcontinent This kind of decline has not been seen even during the Nazi occupation of countries in second world war. It has been estimated by one historian [Late Victorian Holocausts: El Nino Famines and the Making of the Third World \u2013 Mike Davis] that the British killed 20 million Indians in the 1870-1890 period through famines. British PM Churchill allowed 5 million Indians to die during the Second World War according to the book 'Churchill's Secret War' by Madhusree Mukherjee. There is an interesting article in the Tehelka web site which discusses the starvation deaths during the 1940s. Remembering India\u2019s forgotten holocaust | Rakesh Krishnan Simha | Tehelka - Investigations, Latest News, Politics, Analysis, Blogs, Culture, Photos, Videos, Podcasts There has been a recent spate of books on the effect of British rule in India. Two of these books are \u2018India Conquered\u2019 by Jon Wilson and \u2018An era of Darkness\u2019 by Shashi Tharoor. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Overall , we get to live. Yes , because the Britishers gave a Central Government. They were effective in controlling the riots in some cases. The Muslims rulers who earlier treated Hindus very badly continued to treat them as 2nd class citizen. But because Hindus studied and evolved over time . We got good positions in their government. This led to the Muslims leaders to fear that Hindus will rule after Britishers left. And as Muslims treated the minority, they will be treated same way. And so they thought of having an Islamic country of their own. No.Apart from being good at service the Hindus showed good qualities of a civilized society. As Brits dig deeper they found that Hindus are much evolved in terms of literature, philosophy, spirituality,science and their view of the world. To keep them as good slave it was essential to keep them away from their glorious past. And so many theories were propagated. Lies and myths told about us. We were misguided. Are scriptures were misinterpreted by them. These sinister things carried out so that Hinuds don\u2019t gain their pride and win the world with love. But the British rules saved many lives . It was not done willingly. As you can see many riots did took place in British India.Moplah riots and Noakhali riots. Nothing was done to prevent them and punish the perpetrators. ",

In case of British, they have helped in modernizing Hinduism. Some old practices were challenged by the new thinking and helped in renewing Hinduism. British have indirectly helped in bringing the nation closer during independence movement. The English language is helpibg Indians in playing bigger role in various fields. Britishers have helped immensly in keeping old artefacts. For example, Mr Brown helped in keeping a lot of old books in Telugu. His services are exemplory. Similarly, Mr Cotton built a dam over Godavari helping millions of people even now. ",
