            "answer_text": "Treat her as the treasure that she is. For humans, life is all abou having a special \u201cother\u201d in our lives. Many of us mess this up by not appreciating what we have. Many others think they have something they don\u2019t, and still others think that the grass is always greener some place else. We humans are a multi faceted creature. Modern man is assaulted with movie images of beautiful people doing undreamed of things in impossibly beautiful places living unimaginably exciting lives. Being human we have the flaw of envy, alive and well in our magnificent but devious brains. Added to this is the capacity for shallowness beyond belief and we can manage to take something that could and should be paradise on earth and make it ugly. Several TV shows intitled \u201cThe Housewives of Orange Country, The Housewives of Atlanta\u201d and so on, are the embodiment of perhaps the perfect example of what is wrong with modern marriage. When we are so affluent as to allow ourselves to have the free time in combination with being the victim of every item advertised and every fault that idleness , envy and wealth can provide, we get this showcase , this tribute to what we could all be, given the wherewithal. While the husbands work themselves to death in order to provide the resources for them to be this \u201camalgam\u201d of bad taste as a testament to his success. Neither party is really enjoying the happiness available to us all but living an abomination that is the summation of all that is ugly in life. When we aren\u2019t succumbing to the ugliness but live in the beauty of the way that life is truly meant to be. When we are blessed with a life partner that loves us and gives us the comfort, calming and soothing as only a good wife can provide, life can be extremely good. We should treat our wives as if their feet don\u2019t touch the earth when they walk. Many of us have wives that are there for us but we are too much into our own heads to see it, too busy doing something else to look ever more seccessful to recognize it. We men should take every opportunity, that is given us, to show our wives how much we appreciate them, how much we love them and how special we recognize they are. This should be done immotionally not materialistically. Women are immotional creatures more so than visual ones. Men on the other hand are just the opposite. We are more visual and much less emotional. We are so much this way that we have difficulty with relating to the needs of our wives. Mankind is given a brain capable of accomplishing great things as well as being naturally, amazingly insensitive to things obvious to lesser creatures (dogs) . Dogs with much less thinking ability than us, are tuned in, focused to moods, body language and other subtleties that man with all of his mental power is mostly blind and deaf to. This is one of the things that gives me the feeling that God exist. I think this proves that there is this greater power and he has a sense of humor. Perhaps with a sadistic touch thrown it for good measure. Having said all that, the bottom line is we men should attempt to understand these emotional aspects and cater to these needs of our wives. Do the things she finds most comforting emotionally . Give her the the signals that we get her, that we appreciate her and what she does for us . Make it possible for her to realize we understand that she is the reason our lives are the heaven on earth only a marriage that functions in this way can provide. Hokey, well sure, that\u2019s the kind of mind set we have allowed ourselves to get into. We have in our mad dash to achieve what I above described, rushed right past recognizing what it is that is important. What we all want in life is the peace and comfort only a devoted loved one can provide. Two people who truly love each other and have developed the ability to communicate, to actually listen to each other and understand, well it doesn\u2019t get any better than that, as it can\u2019t, there is nothing better than that.
