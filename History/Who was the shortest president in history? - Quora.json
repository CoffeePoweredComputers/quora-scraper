            "answer_text": "Hello, Ashwin\u2014-I\u2019m joking with you, but the shortest president I\u2019m aware of was Benito Juarez, President of Mexico, who served from 1858 until 1872. He was also the first Mexican president of indigenous origin and was considered to be an able and highly competent leader. HE WAS ONLY 4 FEET, SIX INCHES but towered over others in accomplishments. If there were any more diminutive than Juarez somewhere in the world, I\u2019m unaware of them. Now to answer the question I think you meant. The fifth president of the US was James Madison at 5\u20194.\u201d Abraham Lincoln was the tallest at 6\u20193 3/4\u201d in his stocking feet. With shoes and the tall stovepipe hat he wore, imagine how impressive he looked. In my opinion and that of many, Lincoln was tall in both physical and personal stature, meaning that his character and leadership skills were above many. Lyndon Baines Johnson was a tiny fraction of an inch shorter than Lincoln at 6\u20193 1/2 .\u201d Thanks for asking, and I wish you a good day. ",
