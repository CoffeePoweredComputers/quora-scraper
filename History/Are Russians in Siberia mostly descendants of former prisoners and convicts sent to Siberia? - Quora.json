            "answer_text": "Have you ever looked at a map series that showed topology? Siberia runs from the Arctic circle almost down to Iran. The southern Soviet Union is a gigantic prairie divided down the middle by the Urals. Looks sort of like a butterfly. The west wing is Ukraine and the east wing is Siberia. Siberia was one of the last vast tracts of virgin soil, never exploited, on the face of the earth. It had its land rush just as the North American prairies did. But the conditions were quite a bit different for the settlers in Soviet settlement programs. No walking a thousand miles leading your ox and your cart and digging a hole in the ground for shelter in a terrain without trees while you improvised a house out of squares of sod. Some of the people \u201csent to Siberia\u201d were prisoners who were sentenced to hard labour and placed in the mines and logging camps. But most \u201ckulaks,\u201d those who were not in leadership roles in resistance, were \u201cforcibly resettled\u201d by being made to join resettlement programs that millions had joined voluntarily. One faux historian whose true history I am working on wrote a horror story about forced resettlers who arrived at their destinations and found only 40,000 houses were ready for ten times that many settlers. The inattentive reader (not me with this guy!) is supposed to think there should be a house for each person so most of these people had to build igloos. This guy was born to the idle rich, but many of us are quite familiar with multi-family houses. Houses? They had houses built for them? Settlers coming to my part of Canada were given a cow, an ax, and a plot of forested land. Someone checked on them every year or so, and if after five years they had cleared the land and built a cabin they were given the deed. The people being resettled in Siberia were driven to their trains, which was a security measure I suppose but also let them take a lot of luggage. I have seen the travel form that accompanied the trains. It specified the amount of space that had to be allowed for each person, frequency of stops at stations for john breaks, food and water allowances, and had a box at the bottom \u201cidentify the person who will be responsible if the standards aren\u2019t met.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Mostly or not - it depends. If you are going there by train, it looks like you said, but if on plane - not at all. If you chat in English he or she probably descender of decent people, but if you drink cheap vodka with stranger - companion could be a descendant of robber. So, despite of such myth, it is clear, that typical prisoner is a man, not woman, and in most cases - with broken fate. No health, no desire to become a husband, just memories, fantasies and very bad manners. How he could find woman? In Siberia it was much more non trivial task! Former prisoners or convicts tried to return home, to European part. There was a rule, that they have no 100% of civil rights, like return to capitals - Moscow and Leningrad /last was a former capital city/. Lets see a situation: they found wives, but having multiple problems /money, socialization and so on/ - so returned back. They often got a bed in dormitory, and worked in line with professions, they got in camp / = \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u044c / and this is known as \u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439, hired worker = not a prisoner. He is free, he could drive a lorry, or work with expensive or complex equipment /not allowed for prisoners/, or even in a prison - as a guardian. Now all this is mixed. Some people came to Siberia deliberately, like in 1950-ies, sent by Komsomol - communist organization of youth. That time a gender proportion was 50 - 50. So, in some places this suggestion is correct. We use to say \u201cone half was sitting, another half guarded\u201d - \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044f\u043b\u0430. Right now this is a kind of our rust belt. If it is a high-technology place, like a power plant - may be 50 - 50 case, a lot of descenders are children of volunteers. If Novosibirsk - this is an academic city - it is definitely wrong. If it is a city, where some high technology is produced for army, - be sure: everybody was checked, and no ancestors with criminal biography one could find. Now, how about sibiryak - person, who\u2019s ancestors conquered Siberia in XVI - XIX centuries? Old Believers (church opposition), gold miners, skin and fur collectors, hunters were not prisoners at all. Conclusion: it depends. It was very uneasy to find a decent woman in Siberia if someone was a prisoner /so - go back, find some girl with some kind of problems who could merry a prisoner - or fall in love, and return back/. Old believers are very closed group. Several wars collected a harvest of sons, so that time female part became greater, and some prisoners have more chances to stay there and give a breed. Everything is mixed, full of family myths and secrets. So - two legends exist in parallel: Siberia is a land of prisons and prisoners /lager, camp/, but all my ancestors were decent, loyal mans and women. May be except robbers, where everything is arsy-versy, and they support some myths, and folklore and radio tends to spread robbery romantic songs and so. ",

            "answer_text": "No. There are some, I guess. But I don\u2019t know them personally. May be it depends on particular city or village, because I live in the regional center, but it could be that somewhere in taiga in small village near a prison, most inhabitants are former prisoners. I can give you example of my own family. My grandfather was born here, but his parents came from Byelorussia in the beginning of XX century. Not like prisoners, but they were peasants given land in Siberia, that was part of Stolypin land reform. My grandmother was living in the south part of Russia before the war. During the war, she met my grandfather (who was an officer in Red Army), and after the war he had married her and brought her in Siberia. My second grandmother was from north of Russia. She had divorced my second grandfather soon after the war. I don\u2019t know exact reasons for her to go to Siberia, however, she was definitely not a prisoner or exiled. So, I was born and raised here in Siberia, and I don\u2019t have criminals in my pedigree (at least for three generations back). There were several waves of people movements into Siberia since beginning of Russian colonization. Before the revolution, there were soldiers (cossaks and others), old-believers (after religious reform in XVII century - well yes, they fleed from persecutions), the peasants mentioned above. During Soviet period, there was a lot of plant and factories (and railway) construction in Siberia, where people were coming from different parts of the country. And yes, some were sent by Stalin as well. We still have a village in our region inhabited by Estonians, for example. So, Siberian non-aboriginal population is very diverse (and consists not only of Russians, of course). People came here for different reasons, voluntary or involuntary. I would not say that it mostly descends from prisoners. ",
