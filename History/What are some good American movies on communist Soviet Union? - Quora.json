            "answer_text": "There are no good American films about the USSR. The depiction of the Soviet life is so much off in all American films that one cannot watch them without thinking it is some prank or something like this. The answer by Matthew James just made me laugh because the film he recommended looks like trash at best. Not a single detail is close to what was it in the USSR, and besides this a lot of propaganda (they did not arrest Chikatilo because he was a party member, some party officials are homosexuals and pedophiles etc). Plus, the \u201cgood guy\u201d investigator suddenly becomes rich after the USSR fell, he got somewhere a new shining foreign car! And this is in the time of disaster of the \u201990s that happened in realty! I only can suggest he became a very corrupt person because you could not become rich legally in the 1990s, especially being a state employee. ",

Viktor Burakov (Stephen Rea) wants to put a stop to the killings, but the Soviet bureaucracy obstructs him at every turn, insisting a Communist Party member could not be the killer. Burakov is determined to catch Chikatilo, aided only by his cynical superior (Donald Sutherland) and a frightened but determined psychiatrist (Max von Sydow) in this true story.
