            "answer_text": "In my opinion, the meme that \u201cif only we all went organic\u201d, the troubles of the World would be solved. Secondly - food prices would rise, probably trebling - possibly even more than that. Dangerous too - for it would be impossible to feed 7.5 billion people with nutritious food, organically - so there would be a massive famine. A reduction of the over-population challenge. Less need for the burning of fossil fuels - a reduction of carbon dioxide release, lowering the global warming index. Now people tend to be averse to famines - so there would be an equally massive movement of peoples from the less fertile areas to the more fertile areas. Those people in the more fertile areas might be less than enthusiastic about this \u201cinvasion\u201d and start a war. There might then be a reduction of population by another method, but the polution index would rise. Organics does work - on a small scale and for those that can afford to pay the premium pricing. ",
