            "answer_text": "In addition to the other good answers given, please allow me to go off on a tangent, and give some other interesting information. From the very beginning, Christianity was a religion with a book, but it wasn\u2019t the New Testament writers who produced the bible. All the New Testament writers did, was add to the Bible which was already there (The Old Testament was already there). But what right did the New Testament writers have to add to the Bible which was already there? Their authority to do this can ultimately be found in Jesus. Jesus claimed to have an authority fully equal to that of the Old Testament prophet, and the authority of Jesus was continued by the authority of his apostles. Of course, the authority of the apostles\u2019 differs from that of Jesus (Jesus was the eternal Son of God), but the apostle\u2019s authority was derived from the commission they had received from Jesus. It was in virtue of the authority they received from Christ, that the apostles\u2019 added to the Bible of their time. They added those books which are now regarded as the New Testament. In fact, the decisive test for determining whether a book was to be regarded as authoritative or not in the early church (up to the time of the Reformation), was that it had to be written by an apostle or an eyewitness of the resurrection of Jesus! Only those books were received by the church which were written by the apostles, and first hand eyewitnesses of Jesus such as the apostle Paul (Acts 9:15 and Acts 26:16). The church did not create the authority of the New Testament books, the church only recognized the authority which these books already possessed in themselves. Neither did the apostles\u2019 purposely go out of their way to add to the Bible. As I said, they received their commission from Jesus (John 17:18) and then fulfilled their commission under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, who Jesus had promised (John 16:13). So, people owe their Christian life to the writings of the apostles. Jesus Himself wrote nothing. Everything about Jesus in terms of His words and deeds, comes to us only by the authority of His apostles. Even the Islamic Quran uses the term \u201cpeople of the book\u201d in reference to Jews and Christians. ",

The Phoenician city of Gebal, famous for its papyrus trade, was called by the Greeks \u201cByblos.\u201d (See Jos 13:5) In time bi\u00b7bli\u02b9a came to describe various writings, scrolls, books, and eventually the collection of little books that make up the Bible.
