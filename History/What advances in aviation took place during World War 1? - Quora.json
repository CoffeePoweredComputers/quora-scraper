            "answer_text": "This is a shot in the dark based on my study of WW1: -more radios, and eventually better coordination of planes and ground forces: This was not decisive in WW1 in terms of combined arms overall but in WW2 it was decisive initially as German doctrine used such coordination to win until 1942. -strategic bombing: Again in its infancy in World War 1 but in WW1 the psychological effects of aerial bombing did have some impact on enemy morale and reactions. Plenty of resources that would have been better on the Western Front was kept near London to stop a few German Gotha bombers. Either way the advances and experiences in World War 1, and the abhorrence of bloody land campaigns, made strategic bombing attractive to many nations. Douhet\u2019s book and air theorists in the interwar would reinforce this and led to massive strategic bombing in WW2 -Anti-Submarine tactics: It is well known the many aerial aspects were decisive in the Battle of the Atlantic in WW2. Basically either reconnaissance planes to detect submarines for convoys, standIng patrols to discourage German subs to attack, and finally aircraft designed to drop depth charged and anti-submarine capabilities to destroy the German subs themselves. Yet this started in WW1, and recon and deter of subs was reasonably effective in WW1 the aerial capacity to destroy subs in that war was not as effective. While Britain and America did not learn enough of the lessons of WW1 until half war WW2 there was at least the experience of Anti-Submarine tactics in WW1 to go by. -Aerial resupply: This one I am iffy on. Well known World War 2 aerial resupplies were attempted like at Stalingrad, Tunisia, Market Garden, Palembang, Kohima and Imphal, etc. Basically designed to support land forces by replenishing their supplies and logistics. I\u2019m trying hard to think if this happened in WW1 and it may have happened to a small extent when the British were surrounded at the Siege of Kut but I don\u2019t remember if this was notable in WW1 or not.

            "answer_text": "EVERY POSSIBLE ADVANCE took place! Does everyone realize that the airplane (aeroplane) had only just been invented? Louis Bleriot\u2019s quite advanced monoplane airplane with fixed wheeled landing gear and rotary engine (all major advances at the time)Just barely was able to cross the English Channel at the narrowest point at Calais. Every single aspect that makes an airplane a weapon of war except pilotless drone capability was invented on the fly (pun intended) during the Great War by designers, technicians and pilots who had no aeronautical theory, no test facilities, etc to rely on. Someone had an idea, the idea was tried out, often under what we would call battle conditions, and there were spectacular successes and sone spectacular failures. Men often died not during combat but because their plane had a structural failure- wings fell off, engines failed, etc. Oswald Boeckle, the German aviator who first established guidelines for combat aircraft maneuvers (Dictum Boeckle) died that way. \u201cThe Invincible\u201d Albert Ball, the great British early war ace, literally vanished in the air over No Man\u2019s Land, probably hit by an artillery shell fired from one side or the other. The famous Sopwith Camel had a rotary engine with such severe torque (a physical characteristic not well understood at the time) that more pilots died in takeoff/landing accidents than were killed by the enemy. Life expectancy for a pilot at one point was measured in weeks. Navigation was by eye with no reliable instruments, not even a reliable compass, since it\u2019s location near the mass of metal of the engine often made it unreliable. There were zero safety features, no parachutes, no fire protection, radiators of scalding hot water and gas tanks often located right in front of or under the pilot\u2019s seat. Originally aircraft were used to carry observers over the battlefield to draw locations of enemy troop concentrations, trench locations, supply routes, etc. Later the observers began attacking each other with pistols or rifles because the planes could not support the weight or vibration of a machine gun. More powerful engines and stronger airframes led to the possibility of aircraft using one or multiple machine guns, but only firing rearward or at a severe angle forward due to the propeller. Fokker\u2019s invention of the interrupter gear allowed forward firing weapons as we expect today. Wireless radio technology became lighter in weight and could be carried aloft. The advantage would see-saw back and forth between German and Allied \u201cairforces\u201d as each technical development came into being and was then adopted and improved upon by the other side. By 1918, only 3+ years after the idea of \u201cwarplanes\u201d was conceived and little more than a decade after the literal invention of powered flight, aircraft constuction was based on a metal framework, inline engine (not rotary), effective gunnery and other weapons, flight training including combat techniques we still use today, and new aircraft designs based more and more on aeronautical science and less and less on guesswork. All these aspects of the best 1918 aircraft, the Albatross DVII for example, are characteristics of aircraft today. I cannot think of any other technology that developed so rapidly and radically in such a short time after its inception, not even rocket or computer technology. ",
