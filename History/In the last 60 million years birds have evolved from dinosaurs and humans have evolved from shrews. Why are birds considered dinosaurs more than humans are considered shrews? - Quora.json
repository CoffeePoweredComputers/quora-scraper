            "answer_text": "In taxonomy and phylogenetics, the group Dinosauria is considered to be a large, monophyletic \u2018clade\u2019. A clade is nothing but a term used to classify and group together related individuals (or species, or even genera), that share a recent common ancestor, under a common label. In the phylogenetic (the current, and most scientifically valid) approach of classification, individuals, species, or other groups that make up a single clade, must necessarily have descended from a Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA, sometimes also referred to as Last Common Ancestor, or LCA) - i.e. the clade is required to be \u2018monophyletic\u2019. This explanation is just so you can, hopefully, get a broad, big-picture overview of how biological classification works in modern times. The first part of your question goes: \u201cIn the last 60 million years birds have evolved from dinosaurs and humans have evolved from shrews\u201d This statement might be factually inaccurate - and for the following reasons:  Modern birds, or neornithians (clade: Aves) first seem to appear in the fossil record around 67 million years ago (Clarke et. al., 2005). This happens to be very close to, or right around the time of the end-Cretaceous (K-Pg) extinction event. What this suggests is that birds, including earlier non-modern forms within the larger clade Avialae had existed during the Cretaceous as well. An article was published in the leading scientific research journal Nature, in March 2020 (Late Cretaceous neornithine from Europe illuminates the origins of crown birds), described a new species of neornithian (i.e. crown-group) bird. This was a spectacular development because it helped plug a key gap in the fossil record for the evolution of neornithians (in other words - modern birds). This newly-discovered bird species was named Asteriornis maastrichtensis and is remarkable for showing features associated with both galliform (land fowl such as chickens, quails, partridges, jungle-fowl, pheasants, and turkeys), and anseriform (waterfowl such as ducks, swans, geese, etc.) groups. This newly-discovered species lived around 66 million years ago, before the K-Pg mass extinction event that killed off all non-neornithian dinosaurs.  Restoration of an A. maastrichtensis individual in its natural habitat near the water. A pair of Ichthyornis-like non-neornithian avialans scavenge on a dead marine sauropsid in the background.  Restoration of an Ichthyornis dispar. This avialan dinosaur has archaic features such as teeth in its beak, and isn't considered to be a modern bird, although it would've been fairly closely related to the common ancestor of all modern birds (neornithians). Modern birds, therefore, had been around when nonavian dinosaurs were still alive! What that means is that birds didn't just evolve from dinosaurs after the extinction event that occurred 66\u201367 million years ago - they actually lived alongside nonavian dinosaurs - both groups having descended from a recent common ancestor that lived during the Jurassic (in fact, the very first dinosaurs appeared in the Triassic, the age that immediately preceded the Jurassic Age). In case you're wondering, the very first dinosaurs were small (about the size of a chicken or smaller), bipedal, long-tailed, and possibly swift runners. They may even have been covered in downy, feather-like, integument. Dinosaurs wouldn't become the dominant group on the planet until close to the middle of the Jurassic.  Restoration of an Eoraptor lunensis, a saurischian sauropodomorph dinosaur that first appears in the fossil record around 231 million years ago (during the late Triassic). Eoraptor is considered to be very closely related to the most recent common ancestor of all dinosaurs, including birds. Eoraptor is thought to have been omnivorous. So, logically speaking, birds aren't just the descendants of dinosaurs - they are, in fact, a type of dinosaur as well.  Restoration of an Archaeopteryx lithographica chasing a Compsognathus longipes. The origin of birds from nonavian, but still quite bird-like, dinosaurian ancestors goes even further back, to the Late Jurassic (see Archaeopteryx lithographica), around 150 million years ago. While Archaeopteryx is considered to be an avialan, it is important to remember that the group Avialae is a subgroup of the larger clade Paraves - a group that also includes such indisputably nonavian dinosaurs like Velociraptor mongoliensis, Deinonychus antirrhopus, and Saurornithoides mongoliensis.  Restoration of a V. mongoliensis, a dromaeosaurid paravian dinosaur.  Restoration of a D. antirrhopus, another dromaeosaurid paravian dinosaur.  Restoration of an S. mongoliensis, a troodontid paravian dinosaur.  Restoration of a Tyrannosaurus rex, a coelurosaurian dinosaur. Credit: R.J. Palmer - Saurian (2018) Paraves itself is nested within the clade known as Maniraptora, a sub-clade of the wider group Coelurosauria - a group that also includes everyone's favourite nonavian dinosaur, the one-and-only Tyrannosaurus rex.  It is, therefore, factually correct to say that birds are dinosaurs - since all modern birds ultimately evolved from the common ancestor of saurischian dinosaurs like T. rex, therizinosaurids, and sauropods, as well as ornithischian dinosaurs such as ceratopsids, stegosaurids, hadrosaurids, etc. This makes birds, rather indisputably, yet another type of dinosaur (of which there were numerous others).  A Sorex ornatus relictus, an ornate shrew. You have probably heard people say that we descended from \u201cshrew-like\u201d creatures. While that may be true, what it implies is that the very first placental mammals were somewhat shrew-like in appearance, and not that they were actually shrews! True shrews (family: Soricidae) are mole-like mammals that belong to a clade known as Laurasiatheria. This clade includes placental mammalian groups that contain subgroups such as ungulates (i.e. hoofed animals), carnivorans (animals such as cats, canids, etc.), cetaceans (whales, porpoises, etc.), pangolins, and even bats, along with other groups. It's important to note that the group that includes the primates is not a part of Laurasiatheria!  Primates belong to a sister-group of Laurasiatheria, known as Euarchontoglires - a group that also includes all rodents, all members of the rabbit family (including hares and cottontails), as well as gliding mammals like colugos (the closest non-primate relatives of the primate group). This, hopefully, makes it clear that humans are not shrews - why, we're not even rodents (or, for that matter, rabbits) - despite rodents (and rabbits) being significantly more closely related to primates than are true shrews.  Taking the above example one step further, chimpanzees (including bonobos) are our closest surviving relatives within the primate group - but that does not mean that humans are chimpanzees (or, conversely, that chimpanzees are, strictly speaking, human), just that both chimpanzees and humans descended from a common hominin ancestor. It would, therefore, be accurate to say that all chimpanzees and all humans are primates (and, more specifically, Great Apes - a group that also includes gorillas and orangutans). It would also be accurate to say that all chimpanzees and all humans are mammals (along with many other amniote clades, obviously). It wouldn't, however, be accurate to say that humans are chimpanzees. That statement would only be considered to be true if humans had either descended directly from chimpanzees (which, of course, we didn't), or if both humans and chimpanzees had descended from a common ancestor that also happened to be a chimpanzee (this isn't the case either). Lions and house cats, on the other hand, are both considered to be cats, since they both share a common ancestor that was (you guessed it!) a cat.  So, to summarise, birds are dinosaurs, while humans are not shrews. I hope this explanation has given you a bit of clarity regarding how phylogenetic classification currently works in the biological sciences. References: J. A. Clarke, C. P. Tambussi, J. I.

            "answer_text": "So classification is based first on physical traits and anatomical similarity and secondly on genetics. It is not based on behaviors. Classification is based on group consensus and as more is learned about an organism or about genetics, an organism or a group may get shifted around. Probably the single most important thing to remember about science is that it always adjusts to accommodate new information. Sometimes data has been misunderstood because of the limited amount that was known and things get moved around based on new data or a new way to consider the information. Sometimes there\u2019s data and competing ideas on how to view it. This bothers some people who want hard absolute answers that never change. Consider the scientific community viewed the world one way before the discovery of the light microscope. Prior to that device people guessed there might be small things we couldn\u2019t see making us sick but we couldn\u2019t be sure. Once the light microscope opened up the microscopic world to us, we got a flood of observations and data but we didn\u2019t understand what it meant. Years of experimentation and hard peer review lead to germ theory and now provides the basis of modern medicine. We couldn\u2019t make the biggest break throughs until the discovery of the electron microscope and could finally see viruses and see they actually existed beyond speculation. The next revolution happened with the understanding of the dna molecule and its decoding. Scientific breakthroughs constantly reshape how we reinterpret what we have previously observed. The thing observed didn\u2019t change, just how we understand it did. So dinosaurs, birds and mammals. First not all dinosaur lines became birds. Dinosaurs were a big varied group. One line of dinosaurs moved to the biped route (two legs), was warm blooded like modern birds. Their scales modified, the protein keratin makes scales, feathers, nails, claws and hair. That two legged line of dinosaurs split multiple ways and one of those lines headed off into birds, the rest of those went extinct. Despite being warm blooded and having a high metabolism they continue to have scales on their feet, and, most importantly, they lay eggs. Mammals arose from a different line of small four legged warm blooded dinosaurs. In this line the keratin scales soften and became insulating hair. Early mammals laid eggs (there are still two mammals that lay eggs- the platypus and spiney akina) but the one feature that gets you fully into the mammal catagory is the production of milk through mammary glands (mammals=mammary). All mammals, from whales to cows to platypus make milk to feed their young. That feature is the big breaking point from the dinosaur ancestors. Are mammals related to dinosaurs? Yes, they grow out from the same limb, but are a different branch from birds. Overall birds have changed less than mammals have. In all classification you have to have a breaking point were the new grouping has changed enough to be considered a different Category. For example, bears, dinosaurs and lions are both in the Phlyum Chordata (they have a supported spinal column), bears and lions break from dinosaurs at the next level of classification, \u201c Class\u201d by being classified as Mammalia (they have mammary glands, birds shift into Aves here). At the next level Lions and bears are still grouped into \u201cOrder\u201d Carnivora, but at the next level \u201c\u201cFamilia\u201d they split, one headed to Ursus, the other to Felis. Each time you break you become less general and more specific. So long story short, birds have a more direct, less physically divergent form to dinosaurs than mammals do, however birds aren\u2019t really classified as dinosaurs, they just show the cleanest existing line on the tree of life. Some four legged dinosaurs produced the traits that led to mammals, other two legged dinosaurs produced the line that branched off into birds. Dinosaurs didn\u2019t all disappear into these new lines, these branching lines just happened to survive the event that killed off their bigger relatives. ",
