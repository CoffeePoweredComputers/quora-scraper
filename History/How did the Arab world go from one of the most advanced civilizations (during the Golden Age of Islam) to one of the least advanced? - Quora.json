            "answer_text": "The first event was the Mongol invasion which resulted in the fall of Baghdad in 1258 which at the time was the centre of Islamic culture. Then came the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War One which led to the partition of Muslim countries in the Middle East, some of which came under colonial rule. Other Muslim countries, for example, Indonesia also came under foreign rule. Finally, many Muslim countries, until very recently, have been some of the poorest in the world and therefore have not been able to keep up with modernisation as in the West. Today Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States are oil rich and although the Golden Age of Islam has passed, things are beginning to change in the Arab world. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that it was the Mongol invasions that did it. They destroyed the Great Library of Baghdad when they conquered the city, destroying much knowledge, and called into question what Islamic law says about Muslims living under non-Muslim rule. The major schools of thought put forward by how to address that issue were very rigid and stifling of new innovations in Islamic thought ",
