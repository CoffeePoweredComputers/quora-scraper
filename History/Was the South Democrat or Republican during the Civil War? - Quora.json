            "answer_text": "This is a complex question that isn\u2019t quite as simple as Republican or Democrat. The republican party was only established in the 1850s as a result of the collapse of the Whig party, primarily due to splits in the Whig and Democratic party over allowing slavery in the new western territories. Whig Party Democratic Party Republican Party founded Since the Republican party was an anti-slavery party, it makes sense that the majority of those in the south were Democrats (or what was left of the Whig party.) During the war the primary political party in the South were Southern Democrats. While technically part of the same Democratic Party, they were actually distinct from the Northern Democrats. In fact, they ran a different presidential candidate from the Northern Democrats in the election of 1860, which is how Lincoln won the presidency as a Republican (he had formerly been a Whig). Southern Democrats - Wikipedia After the Civil war the South remained a predominately Democratic stronghold because the Northern Democrats and Republicans, who controlled the North and Federal government, were still trying to reform Southern race laws. Of course, all this changed in the 60s after LBJ passed the Civil rights act. Southern Democrats, known as Dixiecrats, were strongly against its passage, but Republicans and northern Democrats helped get it passed. The result was that the Dixiecrats started voting for Republicans, and more blacks, who had overwhelmingly supported Republicans, started voting for Democrats. Now, the republican party is strongly entrenched in those former Confederate States, and you will find the remnants of the KKK, are now primarily Republicans. Fact check: Democratic Party did not found the KKK, did not start the Civil War ",

            "answer_text": "They were Democrats. They passed all the Jim Crow laws! Not a single Republican voted for them. Republicans became a party because of slavery! It was founded by free black men,and abolitionist! In the late 1800\u2019s the first black republicans were voted into the house and senate! The statue of Frederick Douglas has a quote from him that says \u201cI am a Republican, a black, dyed in the wool Republican, and I never intend to belong to any other party than the party of freedom and progress.\u201d! The civil rights act of 64,and voting rights act of 65 would not have Eve been voted on if the Republicans hadn\u2019t squashed their filibuster! Even though LBJ signed it into law very few democrats voted in favor of either bill! The Democrats took away the reparations of 40 acres,and a mule that the Republicans voted for! Nixon,had to call in the National Guard to desegregate schools. The Democrats were still using segregation tactics for years after Nixon! The party\u2019s never switched either! One Democrat changed parties. You can actually look up the specific bills and see who voted for what. Martin Luther King Jr, Alveda King was or is also Republicans. The NAACP was founded by a black American Republican. Hope you do some research and find the \u201c real\u201d truth! The Democrats still use very racist tactics like low expectation racism! They think black Americans are incapable of getting ID\u2019s,getting into college, even getting on the Internet. They think everyone of them are underprivileged,oppressed,live in the ghetto! I\u2019m not saying everyone of them but a real majority! Have a blessed day,and please check for yourself because someone will definitely say I\u2019m wrong but the evidence is out there! ",
