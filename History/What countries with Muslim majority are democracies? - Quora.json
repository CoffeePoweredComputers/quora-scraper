            "answer_text": "The word democracy, in modern usage, is a complex term encompassing a number of related ideas. According to Freedom House's Freedom in the World 2016 survey, around a dozen Muslim-majority countries are currently electoral democracies, on account of having: a competitive, multiparty political system;universal adult suffrage;regular elections conducted with secrecy, security, and without massive voter fraud; andsignificant public access of major political parties to the electorate.Note that this uses a different/stricter definition than the one used by Dimitris Almyrantis. The countries listed are: \"Free\" electoral democracies: Senegal and Tunisia\"Partly free\" electoral democracies: Albania, Bangladesh, Comoros, Indonesia, Kosovo, Niger, Pakistan, Sierra Leone and Turkey (as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina and Nigeria, which are both around 50% Muslim).\"Partly free\" countries not described as electoral democracies: Burkina Faso, Guinea, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, and Morocco (as well as Guinea-Bissau, which is around 50% Muslim)\"Free\" disputed territories: Northern Cyprus\"Partly free\" disputed territories: Somaliland For context, the same definition lists 5 non-electoral democracies in Europe (Russia, Belarus, Moldova, Macedonia and the Vatican) and 3 in continental Americas (Nicaragua, Honduras, Venezuela). Update: another ranking, the Democracy Index, lists four Muslim-majority countries among 79 democracies and flawed democracies: Indonesia (#49), Tunisia (#57), Malaysia (#68) and Senegal (#75). Kosovo, Northern Cyprus and Somaliland are not included in this index. ",

For the criterion of \u201cdemocracy\u201d, I\u2019ve used the fact that in all of the below countries the head of government (i.e. the main decision maker) is freely elected. Others (e.g. Jordan, Morocco) hold reasonably free elections and have a parliament, but the real ruler of the country is an autocrat, not the people elected in parliament.  Some qualifiers: Nigeria is debatable Moslem-majority - some polls say 48%, some say 52%. The same for Bosnia. Also, while many of these are potentially flawed, the democratic process is still basically free and the person voted for gets to rule the country up to their limited terms, which I take to be the underlying standard of democracy. Also, the invisible Comoros. ",
