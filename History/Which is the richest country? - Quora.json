Here\u2019s a list of the 15 Richest countries in the world 2019, ranked by GDP. Wealth can be measured in various ways and doesn\u2019t always have to include how much money a country has. It can also be welfare, health or happiness. In this article, the richest country in the world is measured by the gross domestic product (at purchasing power parity \u2013 PPP) per capita standard. This is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year, divided by the total population for the same year. The value is given in international dollars, which is a hypothetical currency that follows the exchange rate of US dollars. 15. Germany Germany is a major powerhouse when it comes to economy and they have a massive purchasing power. Several world leading companies are from Germany, such as Volkswagen, BMW, Siemens, and Adidas just to mention a few. GDP Per Capita: 52,559  Photo: Shutterstock 14. Iceland In recent years there has been a tourism boom in Iceland, and there seems to be no end in the interest of international visitors. Iceland was hit hard by the financial crisis in 2008, but much thanks to the export of fish and aluminum as well as the influx of tourism made sure that the country recovered quickly. GDP Per Capita: 55,917  Photo: Shutterstock 13. Saudi Arabia The Royal family of Saudi Arabia is one of the richest families in the world, but there is no shortage of other rich oil sheiks and business people in the country. The largest income comes from oil, and the Saudi Arabia has a GDP Per Capita at 55,944. This is also where Mecca can be found, the holiest place within Islam. GDP Per Capita: 55,944  Photo: Shutterstock 12. Netherlands The Dutch have been successful in trading since the 1600s where they sailed around the world. Nowadays, they have a very effective food production which makes it possible to export the excess food. Many vegetables that are sold in Europe comes from the Netherlands. They also have a successful oil refining, chemical industry, and machine production. GDP Per Capita: 56,383  Photo: Shutterstock 11. San Marino San Marino is primarily famous for its banking sector, and the residents are definitely living a wealthy life. Tourism is also contributing to the economy. San Marino is one of the smallest countries in the world, entirely surrounded by Italy. GDP Per Capita: 60,313  Photo: Shutterstock 10. USA A major world power since a long time that has shaped the world into what it is today. USA is the richest country in the world if you consider nominal GDP, but when measuring the GDP per capita, the United States will come at 10th place among the world\u2019s richest countries. The USA has huge income gaps, and there are enormous differences in minimum wages and those who are wealthy. The financial crisis also hit the US economy hard, but they have managed to recover quite well, and the US dollar is as strong as ever. GDP Per Capita: 62,606  Photo: Shutterstock 9. Switzerland Another country that has made itself famous for being a financial center is Switzerland. And it is the banking and finance services that contribute to a large part of the country\u2019s wealthy economy. Switzerland also has an important production industry and tourism. Most of the Swiss would be noted as wealthy in the majority of all countries around the world. For example, one liter of milk could easily cost 7 USD, and a regular cleaner or maid could make more than 3000 USD per month. GDP Per Capita: 64,649  Photo: Shutterstock 8. Kuwait Kuwait has large quantities of oil which is also what makes up the majority of the country\u2019s exports. However, they need to import both water and food since they can\u2019t produce enough food for its population. But that\u2019s not really a problem since most people in Kuwait are wealthy and make a lot of money from the oil. GDP Per Capita: 67,000  Photo: Shutterstock 7. United Arab Emirates The fact that the United Arab Emirates is one of the richest countries in the world might not be surprising at all, considering the many impressive buildings that can be found in the Emirates. For example, the tallest building in the world and the only 7-star hotel, Burj al-Arab. It\u2019s primary oil that has made the Emirates rich, and in recent years they have created a financial center as well that have attracted a lot of wealthy people from around the world. GDP Per Capita: 69,382  Photo: Shutterstock 6. Norway Norwegians became rich from oil and fish. As an example, they introduced salmon for the Japanese people and their sushi. They found huge quantities of oil in the \u201960s, and they have a capital fund worth 1092 billion USD. Almost every Norwegian is wealthy in one way or another, and this has even led to the fact that they import workers from neighboring countries, such as Sweden for lower-skilled jobs. GDP Per Capita: 74,356  Photo: Shutterstock 5. Ireland Did you know that both Google and Facebook have their European office in Ireland? Many companies is attracted to have Ireland as their base due to tax advantages. This has given a huge rise for the Irish economy, and they are now ranked as the fifth richest country in the world! GDP Per Capita: 78,785  Photo: Shutterstock 4. Brunei This small little sultanate has become rich thanks to their huge resources of oil and natural gas. Brunei doesn\u2019t have either tax or VAT. GDP Per Capita: 79,530  Photo: Shutterstock 3. Singapore One of the world\u2019s top financial centers that have become experts in importing products and services to resell. Many Singaporeans are grown up with a desire to become rich, and with the right mentality, will power and conditions, much can happen. The movie Crazy Rich Asians take place in Singapore and give some insights into the rich society and the wealthiest people in the country. GDP Per Capita: 100,345  2. Luxembourg Another small country that has become rich thanks to banking and financial services. They also have a strong industry of steel, rubber, and chemicals. Several of the main headquarters of the EU can be found in the capital of Luxembourg. GDP Per Capita: 106,705  Photo: Shutterstock 1. Qatar Qatar is the richest country in the world according to GDP per capita. Wealth primarily comes from oil and natural gas. Qatar also tries to lie at the forefront when it comes to technical innovation and making themselves independent of fossil fuels in the future. This is also where one of the best airlines in the world has its main base \u2013 Qatar Airways. GDP Per Capita: 130,475  Photo: Shutterstock Side Note: Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macao would all be listed as some of the richest countries in the world, if they were independent countries, Also Monaco and Liechtenstein would probably rank well on this list, but they are not members of the IMF, and are thus not included. More about the richest country in the world The United States is de facto the richest country in the world if you consider the economy as a whole, but if you measure it by GDP per capita, then Qatar is the world\u2019s richest country. GDP per Capita is better to paint the whole picture of wealth in a country. In short, the United States has the largest amount of money, even though they also have a massive state debt. China has the second largest amount of money in the world, and are expected to precede the USA in the future and thus become the richest country in the world. However, the reason why neither the United States or China could be ranked at the top in this list of the richest countries in the world is that there are so many poor people living within their borders, which lowers their GDP per capita significantly.

This list ranks the countries by the amount of money they have.

            "answer_text": "Of the almost 200 countries in the world, many generate billions, and even trillions, in revenue each year. But which one comes out on top as the richest country in the world? We looked at the data to find the top 15 richest countries and the richest country in the world per capita.The ranking are based on the International Monetary Fund\u2019s October 2017 data on GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity, which compares the currencies of countries in relation to the cost of goods and is used to weigh a country\u2019s economy in relation to others, according to the IMF.Many of the highest ranking countries, like Brunei and Qatar, have fuel and oil propelling their economies. However, GDP growth for what are often the richest countries have changed as the price of oil dropped in 2014. Investment and strong banking systems have also helped propel economic growth in other countries like Iceland and Ireland15. Iceland ($52,150) Tourism, exports and investment have driven Iceland\u2019s GDP growth, according to the IMF. The IMF also predicts that the growth of the country tourism industry is also expected to be long-lasting. 14. Netherlands ($53,580) The IMF noted in its 2016 staff report that the Netherlands has been going through an economic recovery. The Kingdom of the Netherlands, which includes Netherlands, Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, and Sint Maarten, has a population of just over 17 million, almost all of which are located in the Netherlands. 13. Saudi Arabia ($55,260) Oil is a large driver for Saudi Arabia's GDP. However, non-oil economic growth is expected to pick up in the country, according to the IMF. The nation of 32 million is also in the middle of its \u201cVision 2030\u201d reform program, an economic plan to move the country\u2019s economy away from depending on oil. 12. United States ($59,500) According to the IMF, the U.S., which is home to more than 325 million people, is in the middle of its longest economic expansion since 1850. The 2016 IMF report also states that unemployment rates have remained low in the U.S. while growth driven by spending and investment have the country\u2019s economy. 11. San Marino ($60,360) The country of nearly 9 million is in recovery mode as rising employment rates and domestic and external demand helped lead to a growth in San Marino\u2019s GDP after a recession, the IMF reports. 10. Hong Kong ($61,020) Hong Kong\u2019s growth rate slowed in 2016, according to the IMF, but it still stands as one of the richest countries in the world. A reduction in global trade and tourism from mainland China led to lower growth last year, the IMF said, but spending is expected to lead Hong Kong\u2019s growth rate to pick up for 2017. The territory has a population of more than 7 million. 9. Switzerland ($61,360) The country of 8 million people is recovering after its central bank lost $52 billion back in 2015. The IMF reported that Switzerland growth reached 1 1/2% in 2016. The country has also been implementing policies to help boost its economic recovery. 8. United Arab Emirates ($68,250) The United Arab Emirates stands as one of the richest countries in the world, with an economy pushed by the oil market, according to the IMF. Lower oil prices and output led to a lack of growth for the country in 2016, according to the IMF, however, non-oil growth in the UAE, which has a population of just over 10 million, is expected to rise in 2017. 7. Kuwait ($69,670) Kuwait, a country of more than 4 million people, bucked the trend of other oil-driven economies faced slower growth in 2016 because to a drop in oil prices and production, according to the IMF, largely because Kuwait saw growth in non-oil areas. And that non-oil growth is expected to continue growing, the IMF said. 6. Norway ($70,590) The Scandinavian nation with over 5 million residents sits just outside of the top five richest countries in the world per capita. According to the IMF, the country was negatively affected by the the lower oil price over the last couple of years. Norway also saw its growth fall to its lowest since 2008 and 2009\u2019s economic downturn, although the country was also able to lower its unemployment rate after its peak last summer. 5. Ireland ($72,630) Ireland stands as a country with one of the highest growth rates in Europe helping it round out the top five richest countries in the world. Spending, investment and construction drove GDP growth in Ireland in 2016, the IMF reports. 4. Brunei ($76,740) While Brunei\u2019s GDP growth declined in 2016, the country actually faired better than expected, according to the IMF. The wealthy country, which is made up of just over 400,000 people, has seen success in adjusting to downturns in the oil market, despite it being a main export of Brunei. Nearly 90% of Brunei\u2019s revenue came from oil and gas, in 2014 the latest figure from the IMF. 3. Singapore ($90,530) Singapore remains one of the world\u2019s richest countries and saw its real GDP grow by 2.7% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2017,the IMF report. The city-state with a population of 5.6 million has been continuously growing since last year as the global electronics trades has rebounded. On a broader scale, IMF notes that Singapore\u2019s economic growth has been limited mainly to its expert-oriented fields. 2. Luxembourg ($109,190) Luxembourg, with a population of close to 600,000 ranks as the world\u2019s second-richest country. The country possesses a strong workforce and its 2016 growth exceeded the European Union\u2019s overall growth. However, the IMF notes that changing a changing landscape from Brexit and policy changes coming for the U.S. can create market instability. 1. Qatar ($124,930) The small Middle Eastern country often ranks as one of the richest countries in the world per capita. Qatar\u2019s population is approximately 2.27 million, giving it a total GDP of approximately $124,930 per person and making it the richest country in world as of 2017, according to the IMF. The country has grown despite facing lower prices for hydrocarbon, a major revenue source for Qatar, which is used for fuel. Qatar\u2019s GDP growth is expected to continue through 2017. Thank you.
