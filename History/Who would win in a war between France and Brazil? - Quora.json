            "answer_text": "Hmm, as a french guy studying in Brazil, I thought \u201cWhy the hell this two countries engage war?\u201d That\u2019s not the question, so I am going to imagine a realistic reason. Actually, France has a border with Brazil. Yep, right in the North of Brazil, from the ocean to the middle of Amazonia, France shares a 730km long frontier with Brazil. It is French Guyana, one of the French over-sea region. This is where we launch our rockets! So let\u2019s imagine, France decide to invade Brazil from French Guyana. They want to take control of the region and be the only one to have the beautiful toucans of Amazonia (I love toucans). Of course, Brazil won\u2019t let go its toucans and fight back. On the ground, the French army is composed of 106 000 soldiers in front of 190 000 Brazilian militaries. Added to the soldiers, you have the equipment of those armies: its 8 148 armored vehicles, 482 weapons of artillery and 82 Brazilian helicopters against 6 648 armored vehicles, 363 weapons of artillery and 295 helicopters on the French side. You can notice that the numbers are pretty close. At first sight, Brazil seems to have the advantage here. Now imagine the war spread to the sea. The army on the ground need some supplies and sea support. Brazil has so many coasts that I don\u2019t imagine the navy not being involved in this war. Let\u2019s suppose France want to impress and send everything they have, people are capable of everything for toucans. They send their 62 ships, 1 aircraft-carrier with 45 aircrafts and 53 helicopters. To defend its coast, Brazil has 318 ships, 2 aircraft-carriers, 16 aircrafts and 71 helicopters. Once again, Brazil has the advantage of the number on the sea. Notice that I don\u2019t count the nuclear submarines of both nations. I consider those weapons to not be used in this war for obvious reason that if you nuke Brazil, you lose the toucans. Now let\u2019s talk about the air force, the most interesting part! To win the sky, France has 212 combat aircrafts and 79 helicopters whereas Brazil has 123 combat aircraft and 112 helicopters. Considering combat aircrafts more effective in a war situation than helicopters, this time, France has the advantage. To recapitulate, according to the numbers, its 2 to 1 for Brazil. But! The technology used by the two armies are not equal. Brazilian equipment is old: half of its navy is considered outdated, and the equipment used by the ground army is partly obsolete. On the other side, the French equipment is among the best in the world. So, I would consider that France would win the war given that, in terms of numbers, both nations are similar and France has the advantage of advanced equipment. I didn\u2019t expect to find this conclusion, but it is not surprising knowing that France is the 4th military power of the world. Tiny but strong\u2026 Today, the question seems ironic. France and Brazil have a signed a strategic alliance in 2008 and France is selling parts of its military knowledge to Brazil by constructing 50 Cougar helicopters and 4 submarines in Brazil. A war between both is improbable. Finally, I don\u2019t think toucans worth any war, as beautiful as they are. Instead of wondering how our two countries would fight, we should wonder how can they get closer around an awesome churrasco (Brazilian barbecue) and with some delicious French wine!

Also, oil-companies : there\u2019s quite a mileage between Brasilia and Paris (even if it\u2019s about the French Guyana, I\u2019m pretty sure that the French M\u00e9tropole would get involved\u2026). I even have a slogan/motto for this war : \u201cFranco-Brazilian war, the next good idea for the transatlantic economy ?\u201d :-) Or we could just invade Portugal if the Brazilians invade Guyana\u2026 Anyway, see you in the next World-Cup, Brazil ! =) ",
