            "answer_text": "Their are two stories behind Chankya's  death..As we all know that Chandragupta Maurya became the king because of faith,belief and trust of Chankya only,that he would bring prosperity in their Kingdom and he'll also look for public welfare too .At that time Chandragupta's life was in danger, many attempts were made to kill him..So Chankya gives him little bit of poison mixed in his food so that he can develop resistivity among poisons,which was not known to anybody even Chandragupta too doesn't know anything about this..One day Chandragupta's wife asked him to share his food with her..at that time his wife was pregnant..so as she eat the single bite of that food,she became unconscious. The Ved(doctors who knows ayurveda very well)who were present their said Chandragupta that poison has infected almost every part of the body,so her baby can be saved only if they just cut her womb and take baby out of her body..Now on the advice of Chankya Chandragupta cuts her wife's womb and took out his baby. That baby was afterward known as 'Bindusara' father of Ashoka The Great. Chandragupta left his kingship and adopted Jainism and leave his Kingdom Magadha. After him, his son became the ruler. Chankya was their in the kingdom only. As we all know Chankya was very clever,intelligent man so many were their who hates him and wants Chankya to be dead. Those people made plan of killing Chankya by telling Bindusara that because of Chankya only his mother died. After knowing this story Bindusara ordered for execution of Chankya. Now from here there are two stories.. Some sources says that he was burnt alive as per the orders of Bindusara.Some sources says that he was able to find his way out of the kingdom and lived in forest where he starved to death. I hope this was satisfactory..If anyone knows other than this then please share his/her knowledge with us. Thank You.. ",

            "answer_text": "Chanakya is one of the most remembered and awesome personalities of the ancient India whose contribution to the field of economics and statecraft are looked with wonder even today. This stupendous hero has accomplished two great works namely Arthashastra (the principles of Economics and Chanakya Niti (Chanakya's Secrets of Statecraft). He was a mighty king maker who single handedly moulded a street lad into a great emperor through sheer brain. Chankya death is clouded with mystery and is not revealed exactly so far despite several efforts by scholars. However, there are two standpoints to it with the one stating that he starved himself to death and the other stating that he was killed through a clever plot woven around him. However, both these stand points stem from the story that is connected to his miserable fate. Chanakya picked up Chandra Gupta from the streets and made him the ruler of a great empire in order to avenge the humility he suffered in the court of Nandas. Chandra Gupta Maurya proved to be a great emperor and nation builder under the able guidance of Chanakya. Chandra Gupta's son Bindusara succeeded Chandra Gupta in the throne and Chandra Gupta took to ascetic life during his last days. Chanakya continued to be the chief advisor for Bindusara. Unable to tolerate the rapport that Chanakya enjoyed with Bindusara, a terrible plot was constructed to create enmity between him and the ruler. The master mind behind this plot was Subandhu, the minister of Bindusara. Subandhu made Bindusara believe that it was Chanakya who killed his mother in a treacherous manner. This created a severe contempt in Bindusara for Chanakya. Chanakya was unable to put up with the behaviour of Bindusara whom he loved the most. Therefore, he left the palace and sat starving until death. During this time, a nurse who was with Bindusara's mother Dhurdha, revealed the mystery behind the queen's death relieving Chanakya from the guilt. The story went this way. When Chandra Gupta, Bindusara's father was on the throne, Chanakya was adding poison to his food day by day to make him strong and immune even to the worst poison so that he shall not be poisoned by his enemies or conspirators. Not knowing this, the queen partook the food reserved for Chandra Gupta when she was pregnant. Learning this, Chanakya wanted to save the heir to the throne and therefore cut open the womb of the mother to save the baby who was rescued from poison and named as Bindusara. In this process the queen succumbed to death. Ultimately, this act of Chanakya followed his duty towards the empire and as a measure to save Bindusara, who was to be the king of the empire. Once Bindusara learnt this story from the nurse, he realized the grave mistake he committed by misunderstanding Chanakya. However, despite his efforts to pacify him and bring him back to the court, Chanakya refused to do so and continued to starve until death. Yet another version of the story states that Subandhu later cleverly burnt him alive. It appears that Bindusara killed Subandhu in utter disgust due to his evil plan. However, the mysterious death of Chanakya is not fully resolved yet. Source: https://www.speakingtree.in/blog/chanakya-death-mystery ",
