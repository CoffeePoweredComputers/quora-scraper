            "answer_text": "That's a moot point. The fact is 1066 was \"year zero\" for the English people and old English culture. About the only people who gained were the remaining slaves who were absorbed into the feudal system.Anyone who had much land was disinherited, and reduced to renting it back. Women lost out as they could hold no property independently of their husbands, and they had no say in council or ecclesiastical affairs. Most senior English clergy were replaced by papally approved Norman ones.The Normans then went on to destroy any native architecture and replace it with massive churches  and oppressive castles.Since the rulers spoke their own version of French, old English was forced underground as the vulgar (but not dirty) tongue and only emerged as an uninflected blend later. Of course the Normans were quite happy to use the superior English infrastructure and systems, which allowed them.to produce the Doomsday book to tax everyone.They then went on to causing trouble for the Welsh and Irish which the English hadn't.It was the end of England's orientation to the Northern world especially after the defeat of Norway and the beginning of hundreds of years of tiresome and bloody engagement with France.A centralised but brutal state was created that would take a long time to become flexible.
