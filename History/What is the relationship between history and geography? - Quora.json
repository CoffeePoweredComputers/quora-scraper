            "answer_text": "History and Geography are very closely related.Geography is an areal science that deals with lands,oceans,atmosphere,people,cultures and earth phenomena,with reference to space and time.History is the study of past with the help of written documents. Many Historical events have geographical linkages.Geographical factors have had impacts on history.e.g. the Himalayas have always acted as a natural barrier for the Indian Subcontinent,thereby developing a distinct culture & history for the region.The only (relatively)easy land route for entering the Indian Subcontinent in the past was the Khyber Pass,hence most invasions in the region had been from that direction only,changing the history of the whole Subcontinent. Foe establishing their colonies in the interior of Africa,the European explorers used the rivers as a mode of penetration into the interior,e.g River Congo.Every historical event has taken place in/at a geographical location.Hence many historical events have been titled after the associated geographical locations.e.g.the Treaty of Versailles,the Normandy invasion,the Iraq war etc. While studying Geography,especially Human Geography,we need to refer to past periods every now and then,to understand temporal changes, for comparisons between past & present situations, changing interactions between human societies and nature over a time period,changes in physical factors/conditions like climate,river course, erosional activities etc.This is where History comes into picture. Many historical documents provide us insight/information about past flooding events, droughts during ancient times,& past climates. Map is an important tool for studying not only Geography,but also History. Expansion and contraction of past empires,limits of ancient civilizations,routes of past human migrations, studies of battles and wars and so many other historical events & phenomena can be best understood using maps.

            "answer_text": "Geography determines history; this much is the simple answer. Carrying this further, one example of how geography determines history is this: A city next to the ocean has access to better trade than a city without an ocean. Another example is how the vikings struggled to grow crops in the permafrost, so they were forced to go on raids. Napoleon, Hitler, and the Swiss all discovered that Russia is difficult to invade because the spring and summer bring liquid roads, deep mud, thawed rivers, and an overall logistics nightmare, while fall and winter freeze everything and will kill an unprepared army. China was given the chance to develop because it had a desert and mountains to the west as well as an ocean to the south and east. The north was basically unprotected; that\u2019s why they have the Great Wall of China. Egypt developed around the Nile River because that was a place where farming was possible. The Viet Minh were able to use guerilla tactics against the United States because of the Ho Chin Min trail. The United States wasn\u2019t allowed to bomb it, so instead we used Operation Popeye - Wikipedia to make it rain year round on the trail, as well as dropping soap pallets on the trail in order to soften it for the rain. Ultimately, it should have worked, but the Spring Offensive caught us off guard. America as a country has essentially been surrounded by water for most of its life. This has not only made it easy to trade with surrounding nations, but it has also made it difficult to invade. With the exception of the 1812 war, the USA has been almost immune to European invasion and has done a fine job of enforcing the Monroe Doctrine. Japan has been able to maintain it\u2019s isolationist policy because it\u2019s essentially an island. However, this same water that made it also immune to invasion, just like the USA, made its isolationism end when the Great White Fleet visited the Japanese. Though I didn\u2019t exactly elaborate, I hope these examples helped you. ",
