            "answer_text": "Do you know that there are some people living in the sovereignty of India, who even don't know what India is ? Shocked? A group of tribal people, the Sentinelese (as we call them; we don't even know what they call themselves), live on North Sentinel Island, a part of Andaman Islands (India). They are the most 'untouched' people of the world. They are completely unaware of modern civilization. We do not know how they live, how they communicate. They don't even want to have any interaction with the outside world. These people are hostile and any approach to interact with them in any way has always resulted in visitors being attacked with stones and arrows by the Sentinelese. A video for reference :   A proof of their hostile nature towards any vistors:  A Sentinelese man firing arrows at the helicopter taking this picture. The most isolated tribe in the world?  North Sentinel Island is easily one of the most dangerous places to visit in the world. Officially, the island has been administered by India as part of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Union Territory since 1947. However, because there has never been any treaty with the people of the island, nor any record of a physical occupation whereby the people of the island have conceded sovereignty, the island exists in a curious state of limbo under established international law and can be seen as a sovereign entity under Indian protection. It is, therefore, one of the de facto autonomous regions of India. In fact, there are many more tribes living in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, who are untouched by modern civilization. Any kind of interaction with many of these tribes is punishable by law under Protection of Aboriginal Tribes Regulation, 1956. Another such tribe is Jarawa (Andaman Islands). Note: This answer is partially based on information from Giuseppe Longo's answer to Which countries are hard or impossible to travel to? ",
