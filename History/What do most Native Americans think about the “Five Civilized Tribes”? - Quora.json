            "answer_text": "I don't have the answer, but I suspect that all tribes think they are \u201cCivilized\u201d. But the colonialist view of \u201ccivilized\u201d was Christianity, centralized governments, literacy, market participation, written constitutions, intermarriage with white Americans, and plantation slavery practices (from Wiki). We know from early American history that many tribes worked well with the colonialist. Even the revolutionary Americans didn\u2019t know what to do with their new land, so Europeans and Native Americans were learning as they went. Things started to break down when some tribes chose sides with America\u2019s enemies (France, Spain, and England), and then the decision to re-settle the tribes of the South to west of the Mississippi. Western tribes might have worked well with the Americans moving west too, but we\u2019ll never know. Like the eastern tribes, the western tribes might have been happy to take up ranching and farming instead of the nomadic life chasing buffalo. They too might have built homes near the railroads, opened business, learned English and Christianity, but they weren\u2019t given the chance. I think the whole \u201ctrail of tears\u201d was a sad betrayal. To think that many of those native Americans were building brick homes, wearing white knee socks with buckled shoes, totally fitting in with their European neighbors, only to be set back 200 years to be dumped on reservations in the future Arkansas and Oklahoma.

            "answer_text": "The Five Civilized Tribes refers to Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole tribes that the U.S. army moved to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) before the Civil War. Each tribe had its own territory and formed its own government. The Cherokee spoke an Iroquoian language. The other tribes spoke a Muskegon language. These were distinct language groups like the Germanic and Romantic language groups in Europe. The Five Civilized Tribes got alone with each other. they didn\u2019t have much contact with most of the other tribes in the U.S. ",
