            "answer_text": "England fought France in the hundred year wars ( which lasted 116 yrs) England had resounding victories early on crecy pointers and Agincourt, the French later victories. England technically lost in the end because France is still France not England or Britain. The nations then fought in the 7 yrs war, technically fighting over empire, America, Canada etc, basically a British victory but plenty of defeats by the French. The French aided America in their war of Independence. The nations then fought in the Napolonic wars, of course the French lost at Waterloo and the French fleet was utterly destroyed at Trafalgar 14 years earlier than Waterloo. So taking into account we'll call the Norman's French and Hastings 1066 a bd that victory. I think we'll call England /Britain v France a draw. We've been allies since Waterloo and both are now friends and fine warrior nations. Both nations have given more to the world than warfare. Humility, culture, invention, democracy, literature, art, fashion the list is endless. P s. I've excluded the Tudor wars, smaller wars etc. ",
