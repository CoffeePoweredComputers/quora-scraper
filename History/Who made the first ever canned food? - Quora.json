            "answer_text": "The French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte wanted canned food for his soldiers. So he offered a prize for the invention of better food preservation. Napoleon's Food Preservation Prize (1795) Napoleon offered 12,000 francs to improve upon the prevailing food preservation methods of the time. Not surprisingly, the purpose was to better feed his army \"when an invaded country was not able or inclined to sell or provide food\". Fifteen years later, confectioner Nicolas Fran\u00e7ois Appert claimed the prize. He devised a method involving heating, boiling and sealing food in airtight glass jars \u2014 the same basic technology still used to can foods. Why Napoleon Offered A Prize For Inventing Canned Food In 1810 Nicolas Appert published the book L'Art de conserver les substances animales et v\u00e9g\u00e9tables (The Art of Preserving Animal and Vegetable Substances), where he described his new canning method.
