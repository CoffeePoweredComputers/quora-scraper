            "answer_text": "The Great Depression happened. As a result, not only did FDR order the mint to stop making $20 gold coins, but anyone owning more than $100 in gold coins or bullion were supposed to turn in the excess amount to the Treasury and get paid paper money for it. People being people, a lot of $20 gold coins were hidden away and survive. You can buy a common date, circulated $20 gold coin today for a relatively small surcharge over its gold value. ",
