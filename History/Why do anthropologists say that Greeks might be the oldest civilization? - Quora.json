However, civilization had already appeared in Mesopotamia and Peru around 5500 years ago, and in Egypt and northwestern India a few centuries thereafter. ",

But I've never read that claim anywhere, or heard it repeated in any documentary, and I do watch a lot of documentaries about ancient civilizations. The oldest known human structures are in the so-called \u201cCradle of Civilization\u201d of Sumer, the foundation of Mesopotamia, located in present-day Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and Kuwait. The First Civilization on Earth: Sumerians from Ancient MesopotamiaThe Greeks came relatively late to the civilization party. Sumerians, Egyptians, Indians, and several other ancient cultures got there first. But when the Greeks finally did arrive, they had a major impact. ",
