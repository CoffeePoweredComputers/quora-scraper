            "answer_text": "As Max Capelluti pointed out, it was not necessarily that they did not have heavy lift equipment they were very creative with basic machines as Max pointed out. The Roman soldiers were engineers as well as fighters, they built the Roman roads that have lasted into modern days. They were built almost with the same basic design as we use in today\u2019s construction. What you do not see inn Roman construction are high rise buildings. A five to seven story building was a very tall building back then. Take a look at the height of the Coleseum, Hadrian\u2019s Arch and the Pantheon. They understood basic laws of physics and mechanics. For heavy lifting they had a crane that was man powered. It had a large wheel that men, probably slaves, walked inside of. Ropes were attached to the perimeter of this wheel and because of the large diameter it allowed manpower to lift stones weighing several tons. Ramps are very useful for getting lighter materials to elevation. Lighter loads would be carried on the backs of men. Ever see movies of how during WWII they built airfields in China with manual labor? The Romans did the same. Unfortunately, while being very knowledgeable and skilled designers, craftsmen and engineers they had a terrible civilization when it came to morality. That is why the great Roman civilization fell.

            "answer_text": "Hello James Warner, the ancient Romans had some absolutely amazing machines, cranes, war engines, siege towers, central heating systems and not last huge water wells with lifting systems. Obviously most Roman timber does not survive in good condition if at all. Below are links to a couple of UK videos.   Regards, James. ",
