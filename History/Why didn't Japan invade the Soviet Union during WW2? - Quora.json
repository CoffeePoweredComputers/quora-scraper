            "answer_text": "Contrary to all of the obtuse lines taken here, the real reason why Japan did not invade the Soviet Union had nothing to do with the commonly cited events already mentioned (Such as anti-Comintern pact, or border conflict in 1939). Rather, it had to do with a particularly event that is not mentioned in any of the answers here. I will start with a brief discussion of this event and then explain why the border conflict in 1939 with the Soviet Union had nothing to do with Japan\u2019s decision not to invade the Soviet Union.  Prior to this event, there existed a factional rivalry within the Japanese Army between the Kodoha (Imperial Way Faction) and the Toseiha (Control Faction). The commonality between the two factions was that they both called for increase in military spending and expansion of the armed forces. The fundamental difference between the two factions, and this is in the simplest terms, is that the Kodoha advocated a \u2018strike-north\u2019 strategy to confront the Soviet Union deemed to be the greatest threat to Japan\u2019s national security. The Toseiha advocated a \u2018strike-south\u2019 strategy, calling for expansion of the war against China and the mobilization of the economy for total war against the West, particularly the Anglo-American powers. Each faction had substantial support from high ranking military leaders in Tokyo which perpetuated the rivalry until the the 26 February 1936 Incident. The 26 February 1936 Incident Long story short, on the 26th February 1936 in Tokyo, a coup d\u2019etat was carried out by a group of about 100 young officers, most of whom were from the Imperial Guards Division and were associated with and supported by the Kodoha faction. The rebelling forces were composed of 1,393 men from the 1st Division, 1st and 3rd Regiments plus 138 men from the 3rd Imperial Guard Regiment. They had substantial support within the senior ranks of the Army and in particular the Kwantung Army in Manchuria. After departing their barracks at 4.00 am. on a cold, snowy night, they carried a flag of the rising sun inscribed with the legend, \u201cRevere the Emperor, Destroy the traitors\u201d. An hour later, the rebels, comprising 9 groups and 1,200 soldiers attacked simultaneously the statesmen who were close advisers to the Emperor whom they believed were leading him away from the true kokutai (national polity) of the nation. They also intended to seize the War Ministry, Tokyo Police Headquarters and the supposedly liberal Asahi Shimbun newspaper. The following men were slated for assassination: Prime Minister General Keisuke Okada.Prince Saionji Kinmochi, the last remaining genro (genro = a senior stateman).Admiral Kantar\u014d Suzuki, the Grand Chamberlain.Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Sait\u014d Makoto.Finance Minister Viscount Takahashi Korekiyo. He was responsible for the expansionary fiscal policy and abandonment of the Gold Standard that brought Japan out of the Great Depression.What was the significance of this spree of assassination? It did irreparable damage to the pacifist element in Japan\u2019s political establishment. With the passing of the genro, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal became one of closest counsels of the Emperor, as noted by the British Ambassador, Sir Robert Clive when Saito was appointed Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal in November 1935: With the gradual depletion in the ranks of the genro, or elder statesmen, the political significance of the office of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal has been greatly enhanced during recent times \u2026 Saito had been at the center of the endeavor of transforming Japan into a great naval power. He had spent years in America and England and was a passionate anglophile. His assassination denuded the court of an ardent pacifist because, while he sought to turn Japan into a world power, he also sought to maintain peaceful relations with other major powers in the world: we should not opportunistically attempt a sudden expansion of our navy in one conference or two we should gradually enhance our national strength-our economic and industrial power-while winning greater respect and understanding from the rest of the world. By contrast, the rebels in the Kodoha faction believed in the restoration of traditional Japanese values, a rejection of modern capitalism and the need to defeat the Soviet Union. Hence, they despised politicians whom they regarded as traitors who embraced Western ideas, who yielded to demands of Western powers which injured Japan\u2019s national honor. Hence, the Kodoha\u2019s conviction clashed with that held by the aforementioned Japanese politicians. This was one of the motives underlying their determination to assassinate those prominent members of the Japanese government. The death of Saito amounted to the elimination of pacifist element that could have countered the hawkish element in Japanese politics and ultimately prevented a war with the West. Consequently, the 26th February had far-reaching ramifications for Japanese politics and the direction of Japan\u2019s foreign policy in the international stage. The Kodoha rebels believed that their devotion to the Imperial Institution and righteous assassination of the \u201ccorrupt and traitorous\u201d politicians would win sympathy and support from the Emperor. They were mistaken. Emperor Hirohito was less than sympathetic. He furiously told General Yoshiyuki Kawashima who was on the side of the rebels that: whatever their excuses, I am displeased. They have put a blot on the nation. I call on you, War Minister, to suppress them quickly. This was one of the rare demonstration of completely independent action by the Emperor (with another one being the Emperor\u2019s personal decision to surrender following the destruction of Hiroshima + Nagasaki by A-bombs in August 1945). Wearing an Army uniform throughout the time the rebellion took place, the Emperor overruled his advisers and ordered the revolt to be crushed immediately without mercy. This was one proof that the Sovereign had real power during the war which debunks the persistent myth that he was merely a symbolic figure without real power. Obeying the Emperor\u2019s order, the rebels laid down their arms. They were harshly dealt with. Secret trials were ordered held in camera. The defendants were declared guilty and subsequently executed by firing squad. Apart from the effects it had on Japan\u2019s politics, the event\u2019s far-reaching ramifications extended to the Japanese Army. Infuriated by a coup that left an \u201cindelible black mark on the history of the Showa reign\u201d, Hirohito ordered a purge of anyone sympathetic to the Kodoha faction. The new War Minister, General Hisaichi Terauchi, was entrusted with purging 2,000 of the Army\u2019s 8,000 officers. They were either dismissed, forced into retirement or sent to outposts far away from Tokyo. The Kodoha faction was completely wiped out, leading to the elimination of the long standing factional rivalry within the Army between the Kodoha and the Toseiha. Factional rivalry was one of the major obstructions to escalating the expansionist war in China and later the Anglo-American powers. The strike-north Kodoha faction was by then dead. The strike-south Toseiha faction which enjoyed the Emperor\u2019s support assumed total control of the army. Not only that, thereafter the Japanese Diet would have to submit to the ambitions and directives of the IJA\u2019s leadership. If the IJA\u2019s leadership disagreed with the cabinet\u2019s decision, they brought it down by having the war minister resign. The Toseiha, less enthusiastic than the Kodoha about a war with the Soviet Union, was committed to escalating the war in China southward from the bases in Manchuria. They were convinced that the southward expansion would bring control of valuable assets for Japan that were essential for the establishment of a powerful economic autarky capable of competing with the the Anglo-American powers. In effect, the 26th February triggered a series of decisive developments that caused Japan to become a military-dominated fascist dictatorship and put her on a trajectory of confrontation that ultimately led to war with the Anglo-American powers. Equally important, Soviet spy Richard Sorge accurately interpreted the events of the 26 February Incident as proof that the \u2018strike south\u2019 faction had prevailed. In his assessment entitled \u201cViews on the Housecleaning of the Army [1936]\u201d, he concluded with certainty that the target of Japanese military expansion would be China, not the Soviet Union. And this was the actual reason why Japan did not invade the Soviet Union. As you can see, Japan\u2019s decision not to invade the Soviet Union had its root in a pivotal event in 1936, not the border battles with the Soviet Union in 1939 as many people have mistakenly believed.  Regarding other major events mentioned in other answers, I will briefly explain why they had nothing to do with Japan\u2019s decision to not invade the Soviet Union. The Anti-Comintern Pact Signed on 25 November between Germany and Japan (and later by Italy), the pact was more grandly titled than it was substantive. Contrary to the impressive title, in practice if either Japan or Germany was attacked by the Soviet Unions, they would simply consult with each other about what to do rather than to cooperate and support each other militarily. The Pact was conceived by Joachim von Ribbentrop - Hitler\u2019s ambassador - and Lieutenant General Hiroshi \u014cshima - the Japanese military attach\u00e9 in Berlin. Ribbentrop sought to form an alliance between China - its historic ally - with Japan with whom Germany was seeking to deepen diplomatic relation. This was a completely infeasible idea because of the war between China and Japan. As for Oshima, he envisioned that a Germany-Japan alliance would facilitate the subordination of China to Japan. As you can see, those were utterly conflicting aims that were impossible to achieve. Battles of Nomonhan (Khalkhin Gol) [May-September 1939] This was nothing more than a minor military engagement that ensued after a small Japanese unit led by Lieutenant Colonel Yaozo Azuma was destroyed by Mongolian units in a scouting mission. In retaliation Lieutenant-General Michitaro Komatsubara, commander of the 23rd Division, crossed the Khalkhin Gol River at the end of June. It was an operation unapproved by the High Command in Tokyo rather than an attempt to invade the Soviet Union. The Japanese were soundly defeated by the Soviets. Again, contrary to what many people believe erroneously, Japan\u2019s defeat in this battle did not underlie Japanese decision to not invade the Soviet Union. However it did extinguish whatever desire Japan might still harbor for a strike-north strategy. The true reason was still the eradication of the strike-north Kodoha faction in 1936 as explained above. A lot of people argued that the Battle of Nomonhan discouraged the Japanese Army from invading the Soviet Union. My counterargument to that is that the Japanese Army was actually capable resisting the Soviet military effectively. Just take a look at the casualties suffered by both sides below:  The Japanese suffered considerably lower losses than the Soviets did. This was strong evidence suggesting that they could take on the Soviets and inflict heavy losses on them. If the Japanese Army was such a pushover, the Red Army would not have bothered keeping 40 divisions in the Far East to defend against aggression by the Kwantung Army. Lastly, bear in mind that the Nomonhan Incident occurred in 1939, two years after the outbreak of a full-scale war with China in 1937 (following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident). By this point, the Japanese army had been embroiled in a protracted war with China whose end was not yet in sight. The need to fight war and to control the hard-won gains in China forced Japan to commit much of her army manpower and resources and consequently they did not have enough troops for an invasion of the Soviet Union. Later, when Japan engaged in total war with the Anglo-American powers, her resources were strained even further which rendered a large-scale invasion of the Soviet Union impossible.

            "answer_text": "Japan did invade the Soviet Union during World War II if you consider the start of the war to have been prior to the German invasion of Poland on 1 September, 1939. When did WWII really begin? | HistoryNet But even if you do not count it as part of the actual conflict, there is no question that the undeclared border war between Japan and the Soviet Union along the Khalkin Gol River in Mongolia in 1939 cast a long and decisive shadow on the Second World War. Tensions between Imperial Japan and Czarist\u2014and later, Communist\u2014Russia dated back to the late 19th century. Relentless Russian exploration and imperial commercial expansion in Siberia and along the Asian Pacific coast collided head on with Japanese designs on Manchuria, the northeastern coastal region of China bordering on Russia and Mongolia. The first serious clash between the two nations came in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20135. Japan won a Pyrrhic victory in the largest land battle at Mukden, but would certainly have been forced to sue for peace had the war continued and massive Russian reinforcements reached the war zone. However, the smashing Japanese triumph in the naval Battle of Tsushima Strait combined with the widespread unpopularity of the war amongst the Russian people brought the Czar to the negotiating table. When Japan emerged from the war as the victor, it cemented her status as a world power.  Painting of Japanese and Russian Troops During the Extremely Bloody Fighting at the 1905 Battle of Mukden. Bloodbath at Mukden: Imperial Russia and Japan Collide Battle of Tsushima | Russo-Japanese war William Pellas's answer to How did the world see the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese war? The Russian Revolution of 1917 led many expansionist-imperialist Japanese to cast a longing eye on the Far Eastern marches of Russian territory, but Tokyo\u2019s ambitions were put on hold when the communists finally won the ensuing Russian civil war in 1922 and the Soviet military reasserted Moscow\u2019s control over what was now known as \u201cthe Soviet Far East\u201d. Japan, however, renewed its overseas military adventuring on the Chinese mainland in 1931. The Japanese Army, though claiming provocation by China, in all probability staged an incident near the city of Mukden (the site of Japan\u2019s victory in 1905) which it used as \u201cjustification\u201d for seizing the city\u2014and, later, all of northeastern China / Manchuria. The subsequent puppet state set up by Japan to administer the conquered territory was known as \u201cManchukuo\u201d. Japan's Military Aggression in East Asia 1931 -1937 Success in this venture caused great lust for conquest among Japan\u2019s leaders. A furious argument soon ensued over the two competing visions for additional expansion which were put forward by military planners in the army and navy. These plans were known as \u201cStrike North\u201d and \u201cStrike South\u201d. The southern plan, championed primarily by the navy, believed that Japan should look to the South Pacific and the rich but not well defended colonial enterprises of the Dutch, the French, and the British as the easiest targets. The northern plan held that existing Japanese gains on the Asian mainland could be leveraged into a massive empire which would gobble up Mongolia and the Soviet Far East all the way to Lake Baikal in south-central Siberia.  The Shoreline of Lake Baikal in Russian Siberia. The Strike North faction eventually prevailed and approval was given for a probing attack against the Russians and their allies in Mongolia. Japan got the excuse it was looking for on 11 May 1939 when a Mongolian cavalry unit crossed over into Japanese-held Manchukuo because its soldiers were looking for grazing land for their horses. Subsequent skirmishes resulted in a Japanese defeat, though this was a company-sized encounter with total Japanese killed and wounded at around 150 men. Massive reinforcement by both sides soon followed. Command of the Soviet force was given to General Georgy Zhukov\u2014later the most famous and arguably the best of the Russian field commanders in the Second World War. Skirmishing and probing attacks (notably three by the Red Army that were bloodily repulsed) continued through the first three weeks of August, but on the 20th of that month, Zhukov launched a massive combined arms offensive. In fighting that raged until 31 August, the Red Army, with the assistance of the Soviet Air Force and two Mongolian cavalry divisions, thoroughly defeated the Japanese. Casualties were high on both sides, with more than 15,000 Japanese and 24,000 Russian and Mongolian soldiers killed or wounded. This amounted to close to half of the total Japanese force, and around a third in the Soviet order of battle. The end result was an immediate end to Japanese attempts at capturing Russian territory and resources, and an immediate redeployment of Japan\u2019s military for a pending attack on multiple targets according to the Strike South strategy\u2014including Pearl Harbor. Thus the entire course of the Second World War was changed by this one battle in the remote steppes of Mongolia.
