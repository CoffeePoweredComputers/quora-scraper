I don\u2019t know how someone else might define a believer and a christian but this is what i think the difference between those two words are: A believer is an individual who believe in Jesus Christ, has accepted Jesus Christ in their life, live their life according to what is written in the bible and have a relationship with Jesus Christ.Whilst a christian could be an individual who just label themselves as a Christian, believe that Jesus Christ came on earth, live their life according to what they think is right for them, have a lifestyle similar to those who are unbelievers.I\u2019m not trying to say that someone who call themselves a Christian or a believer is automatically behave what i defined above but this is just what i think. However,no matter if someone call themselves a christian, they are still technically a believer and verse visa ",

            "answer_text": "The terms believer and Christian are often used synonymously. However, I think the concept of a believer is an inherent subset of the term Christian. The difference between a believer and a Christian is action. Belief can be to a great degree passive. I can believe in diet and exercise but not act.To be a Christian means you actually try to live as Jesus taught.You have faith demonstrated by works.You repent and are baptized by immersion for remission of sins by one having authority.You receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost and follow the promptings provided to do good works as directed by the Lord.You endure to the end.Being a Christian is far more than just confessing the name of Christ.
