            "answer_text": "Churchill was a brilliant man with many positive attributes. He could be charming, was always witty and was personally brave beyond all doubt. He may, ultimately, have been the most consequential person of the 20th Century. As for what he did for the US, specifically, quite a lot \u2014 some good, some bad, some the jury is still out. Bottom line, he (as much as one person could) destroyed the British Empire by one fumbling idea after another. His hatred of Germans helped box them in (pre WW1) at a time when they were trying to cozy up to the Empire. Germany and UK could easily have formed an alliance but Churchill (as far as able) convinced government to continue to coddle France. During the interwar years his \u201cten year rule\u201d made it absolutely certain that the Royal Navy would fade. Also, he was a huge supporter of the Washington Treaty, which tossed a strong pact with Japan into the dustbin, but got nothing in return from the US (certainly no promise to defend the empire\u2019s holdings). Now, rather than Japan having the UK\u2019s back and protecting Pacific holdings, a furious Japan saw the UK as an enemy and eyed its overseas possessions with a covetous eye. The 5:5:3 rule, which Churchill championed (due to the costs of WW1) ensured that the US would very quickly pass the UK in naval supremacy (while further insulting the Japanese). The RN faded and the USN became the guarantor of the sea lanes. The strategic weakening of the UK, while a furious Germany rearmed \u2014 oh, buy the way, Churchill was instrumental in the RN helping \u201cstarve\u201d Germany after WW1, which he thought was great) helped make WW2 a foregone conclusion and certainly left the UK miserably prepared for another global conflict. The UK, brave though she was, was manhandled by the Germans and Japanese at the outbreak of war. Churchill had to (continuously) go hat in hand to Roosevelt for assistance, including handing over a bunch of cool military tech to an isolationist and pacific US). In 1939 the sun had yet to set on the British Empire, in the early 40s that same empire needed to borrow ships and weapons from the US, and by 1945 3/4 of the soldiers and most of the materiel on the Western Front were American (as well as the Supreme Commander). WW2 was caused by Churchill as much as by Lloyd George and Clemenceau, in my opinion, and that conflict thrust the US onto center stage, and forced the UK off. ",
