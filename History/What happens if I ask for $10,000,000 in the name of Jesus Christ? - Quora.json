            "answer_text": "Well, first, we\u2019d have to check to see if Jesus Christ has an account with us. Then, we\u2019re going to have to see some ID proving that you are this Jesus Christ. Two forms of photo ID. It\u2019s a large amount, would you like that as a money transfer? If you want it in cash, you\u2019re going to have to arrange for a service to move that much money for you, and you\u2019re going to have to give us a few days to get it on hand. Also, although we aren\u2019t telling you this, there are going to be some nice folks from the Treasury department who would like to chat with you when you come to pick it up, because you aren\u2019t THAT Jesus Christ, and while changing your name to get access to his savings account may seem clever, they take a dim view. Jesus Saves\u2026 but you aren\u2019t a co-signer on his account. ",

            "answer_text": "You would find that God is not a cosmic ATM. This (well, roughly equivalent questions) has been noted by Christian theologians for almost twenty centuries. Yes, the New Testament says that God will give you whatever you ask in Jesus\u2019 name. It also commands that you ask for God's will to be done, and that ask for things if they are God's will. Early Christian writers noted that Paul didn't always get what he wanted (indeed, Jesus did not have \u201cthis cup\u201d -- the crucifixion -- taken from him), and that Christians generally could not count on God to spare the the vicissitudes and suffering attendant on human existence.
