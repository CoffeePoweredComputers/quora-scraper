            "answer_text": "They both fought for the rights and liberties of the common citizen, against aristocratic privilege. Julius Caesar's political supporters were known as the Populares, who believed political power should be gained though democratic means (by way of the people's assembly and tribunate). They were opposed to the Optimates, who wanted to limit the power of the plebes and extend power in the aristocratic Senate.    Like Caesar, Napoleon fought for the popular rights of all citizens, not just the aristocracy. Napoleon fought against all the monarchies of Europe, especially England. They feared France's republican ideals would infect their monarchical systems, and wanted to return France to the Bourbon line of rulership.   What is interesting is that both Caesar and Napoleon decided it was a political necessity to become Emperor, even though they didn't want to. Napoleon thought being crowned Emperor would satisfy the monarchs of Europe into thinking France was more of a monarchy than a republic. Caesar hoped that being crowned would enable him to further his political ideals.  ",

            "answer_text": "Both were born into elite families within their respective societies, and therefore both were fortunate enough to be well educated from their early years in matters of leadership and military affairs.  The two men lived during times of civil war and chaos, and each was able to show great ability for fostering stability in their societies.  For this reason they were much loved by the military as well as the general masses.  The elites initially embraced Caesar and Bonaparte since these two men were able to bring order to their nations.  However, these two men intended to remain in positions of absolute power once peace and order was reestablished, and this was not much appreciated by their peers in the ruling class. Caesar and Bonaparte were always eager to use their armies to subject other nations and enlarge their empires, and they had brilliant successes(although Bonaparte outlived his success).  For many historians(or perhaps amateur historians such as myself) it is almost impossible to see these two men as peacetime leaders.  The two were quite competent diplomats and socialites, and they were well experienced in the world of shifting power alliances.  Each had an inner circle of men and women who would remain loyal well after their deaths. Their fearless ambition and great capabilities certainly added definition to European power balances, and changed to world for better or for worse.  They each made their first and last names into timeless symbols of power.     ",
