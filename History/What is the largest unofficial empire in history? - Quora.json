            "answer_text": "One of the largest might have been the Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich. The nature of the term Empire is largely built on the Sphere of Influence and Control and not so much on Treaties and actual Annexation - I can declare that I hereby annex all of Europe and am now the Emperor of this United Europe, still it has no legislative value because I do not possess the might to enforce this claim. This, if you\u2019re considering occupied, controlled land as belonging to a state, which by the original nature of the state is probably the most accurate way to describe ownership of a state over land, would make the Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich, Greater German Reich / Empire one of the largest \u2018Empires\u2019 to exist. At its greatest extend in 1941/42, it controlled most of Europe, so much of Europe in fact that it even today with the existence of the European Union was never repeated again. Funnily enough both the EU and the Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich were founded by Germans which makes them the people who desired European Unity and Harmony the most in all of history - under their rule, of course, you can\u2019t trust those pesky peasants! Anyways, I\u2019m getting off topic. This is how the de facto controlled land and sphere of influence looked like at its greatest extend.  One might also add Switzerland and Sweden to it. Arguably Turkey and Spain also deserve a place there but the German control on those countries is questionable. All the other lands we see here coloured in various kinds of blue were either German occupied land or German de facto puppets which had parts of their land occupied. They were unquestionably at Hitler's whim and would have made any concessions without question. I personally consider the Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich one of the largest unofficial Empires - probably the second largest, the Soviet Union would most likely take the place for the largest unofficial empire in history, but their status as an empire is quite established. My Size Ranking of Unofficial Empires: 1. Soviet Union Post War with Warsaw Pact - though Romanians status is questionable 2. Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich with Axis - except Japan, Japan was a major power with an sphere of influence itself 3. The American Empire - obviously excluding NATO ",
