            "answer_text": "Best Presidents since 1949 John. F Kennedy: I dont think this is close. NASA, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Berlin, Civil Rights Acts, Peace CorpRonald Reagan. Yes I know Demicrats are choking on this selection. However he inherited a country in a mess. The country was in a confidence crisis. Jimmy Carter called it a malaise. Double digit inflation, double digit unemployment, and double digit interest rates. It is arguable that he inherited the second worst economic crisis in history. Russia was perceived to have surpassed us in military superiority and communism was on the march across the globe. Reagan guided at the time the greatest peacetime expansion in US History. In fact if you toss out the mild two month recession of GH Bush mich of Ckinton economic success coukd be attributed to Reagan. His policies led to the collapse of the Soviet union. The sophisticated weapons the USA used in the wars in iraq and terror were researched and developed during his administration including the missile defense.Truman. Many would argue that he should be no. 1 but I think he us a bit over rated be ause ge made the decision to drop the bomb on Japan. His administration initiated the policy of containment of communism that was instrumental in our eventual victory in cold war. However he tied our military hands in Korea.Eisenhower peace and prosperity of the 50sClinton peace and prosperity of 90sGH Bush. Under appreciated. Desert Storm. Spoiler Ross Peroit prevented a second termIt's too early to objectively evaluate Trumo and Obama's policies from a historical context. Plus pattison bias clouds objectivity. LBJ, Carter, NIXON, GW BUSH I would call failed presidents ",

            "answer_text": "Not \u201cone\u201d best president, three, each having the judgement, courage, perseverance, and greatness, to save our great country. Who do you think they are? Correct! Abe Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt, and John Kennedy. Abe Lincoln did the impossible, he kept the country together while going through a multilevel political and personal nightmare. No easy job bringing the South back into the Union, without grinding them into the dirt: he made sure that they came back as equals, not a defeated country. FDR: He did everything he could to get America into WWII, and was successful before it was too late, an almost impossible feat considering how public opinion was so against another war, and considering the powerful \u201cAmerica First\u201d (hmm, that sound familiar?) groups that hated the concept that America would become \u201cglobalist\u201d if we entered the conflict. If we did not get into the war, Germany most certainly would have built the first atomic weapon, and the world would not be what you see today. JFK: his perfect analysis of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and his decisions which resulted, averting WWIII. ",
