            "answer_text": "Well, \"Roman Gaul\" - assuming you mean Gaul under Roman rule - describes a very wide span of time, from Caesar's initital conquest of the region to the eventual splintering and disintegration of the Western Empire. But broadly speaking, the Roman rule of Gaul saw a gradual Latinisation of the previously Celtic-speaking Gallic tribes. The Druids, who supposedly acted as the main guardians of traditional Gallic culture, customs and ritual, were hunted down and exterminated. It was under these circumstances that Gaulish was, in time, replaced entirely by Latin - though I have read some theories that Armorican Gaulish might have survived longer. Gaul was eventually conquered by the early Salian Franks in the twilight years of the Western Roman Empire. Gaul, at this point in time, was already thoroughly Latinized. For all intents and purposes, the Franks merely replaced Roman/Gothic dominion with their own. Centuries later, under the subsequent Carolingian Dynasty, the Frankish Empire would be split into three kingdoms - Western, Central and Eastern Francia. Western and Central Francia together covered most of the lands that once comprised Gaul - but the two kingdoms were ruled seperately, even if they theoretically both fell under the Frankish Empire. This would in time dissolve \"Gaul\" as a term of any real use or meaning. The new Frankish kingdoms of the day replaced the classical regional boundaries. The kingdom that covered most of historical Gaul was Western Francia. This kingdom was the nucleus and origin of a new country that would eventually take its name from its Frankish rulers - France. The variety of Latin spoken by the local Gallic population for so many centuries was also eventually given its own name - French. Really, there is no readily available distinction to be made between Roman Gaul and Frankish Gaul. Both periods simply represent two chapters in the formation of the French state. ",

            "answer_text": "Roman gauls are seen as hybrid Roman - Celtic-Gaelic culture but it was in reality just influence of Roman Empire on local Gaelic tribes. There is no real difference between terms you use, however there was big cultural, language gap between present France and Germany during ,say, vast Frankish Empire under the rule of Charles the Great around 800 when he was crowned as Emperor. The big difference and the formation of two nations were visible at that time, it was not just about splitting the power and vast land for his offsprings, there was clash of languages and culture, but Frankish Gauls equal to Roman Gauls aka Celtic tribes because there are present France, even split into small principalities over the time, as well as German duchies and small kingdoms. The Frankish name was used for huge empire under the conduct of some ruling houses but it was also linked with German aka Teutonic tribes. You see Charles Great defeated Muslims at Poitier which is a land of Roman aka Frankish Gauls but it was a part of huge Frankish empire where also Teutonic aka German tribes and more tribes were involved. What save present Czech republic was formation of nation based on strong leaders, economy, language and culture, start with Great Moravia empire, where also the ruler sent for priests to Byzantine Empire bcs Frankish clerics tried to spread the power over Christian independent lands. It is a way how St Cyril and Methodius came to Great Moravia and created new Glagolic alphabet bcs the Great Moravia wanted to remain independent and out of Frankish influence. It was not quite successful, the next ruler changed the mind but the nation was established, new alphabet moved to Bulgaria and Russia where the exiled Methodius priests found rescue and it is a way how azbuka alphabet was created, Czech republic, Hungary and co stayed with Western Europe a la Frankish empire culture and Christian church, but nations formed. There were some Slavic tribes in Eastern Germany but they were not able to establish own identity, country and they lacked strong leader. See how many English kingdoms were present in this time, Mercia etc, until they united into one kingdom under one king and it was easier bcs we are on the island, even there were So if Hungarian tribes as nomads flooded Panonia as a part of Great Moravia, they also assimilated with local Slavic tribes. Yes, it was by force as Roman army occupied Gaelic tribes in present France, but different situation. I will explain. Panonia aka present Hungary is fertile soil, you also see many Hungarian princely houses being huge land owners what delayed the development of the country in Austrian - Hungarian empire, where present Czech republic and Austria were industrial, the rest was rural poor parts of the bunch of different speaking nations, so no for united kingdom or empire, but around 900 when Hungarians stormed into Panonia, they assimilated and they stayed. They were nomads, raiding countries, taking things, they had no clue how care of the land, anything about farming. They had no idea how name things and tools, so you see a lot of Hungarian surnames such as Kovacs what is Czech kovar aka Smith, or we laugh with Hungarian friend when she calls the glass aka pogar in her language bcs it is very ancient Slavic name for the glass from Czech pohar but they will look on me like on UFO if I will ask George Percy with Pass me a tumbler, dear man! It was different story with Gaelic tribes in present France. The Roman occupants were at higher level, better with tools, agriculture etc and French soil is rich and fertile, anyone likes money and good life, so it is how Roman influence won over Gaelic presence. It also explain why vast places of present Germany were covered by deep woodlands, and stopped Roman army. The same case with Scotland, we know Highlands are cold, not fertile, there was anything to get, to steal, to gain. Local people were poor. The same applies on Wales but mountains, you see visibly today where is Gaelic custom preserved - hilly Wales. Romans stopped by Chester which is still fertile land, it was a part of Wales and the border starts just a mile behind the city, bcs Edward III changed that when he wanted to win Wales for English crown but Romans did not explore more bcs Welsh folks hiding in mountains were hard to fight off and there was nothing to gain or steal, take from them. It is even now tough life if Tata Steel closed and EU does not raise import duty of steel up to 600 per cent like USA recently bcs China will have free economy soon and their steel is super cheap, but Romans could not get any iron etc from Wales at that time, from Scotland, so they stayed by Chester or by Powys where is still fertile land with apple trees, Brecon Beacons are not for them unless they thought about training their troops for SAS and Fan dance. Present French flat landscape was great for farming, great for Roman army formations, that\u2019s why so huge Romanisation. ",
