            "answer_text": "After Octavian vanquished Marc Antony and sidelined Lepidus, he became Rome's first Emperor. Early in his reign, he decided to maintain the Empire's current boundaries - only expanding to easily defensible borders (the Rhine, the Danube, etc).  Rome, first and foremost, was a Mediterranean entity. Full control of the surrounding shores allowed Rome's lines of communication, trade, and logistics to operate freely across the Mediterranean. Free-trade, order, and unity across such a great expanse led to enormous economic growth, the Pax Romana. Control outside of the surrounding shoreside provinces (and additional inland provinces to serve as buffers) didn't really add much to the Pax, the beating heart of Roman power. However, years before Octavian's final victory over the Second Triumvirate, Julius Caesar was in a very similar position - finding himself the last surviving member of the First Triumvirate. Upon Caesar's death, he was planning for a massive campaign against the Parthian Empire to the East.  Now, I can think of two big reasons of why Caesar would've wanted to launch a campaign against the Parthians. First: many years ago his co-Triumvir Crassus had launched his own expedition against Persia. This didn't end well, and the defeat was a colossal humiliation. Second: the shadow of Alexander can not be understated. Alexander the Great was the man that every conqueror held themselves up against. In fact, Caesar had once wept tears of humility when he saw a statue of Alexander in Spain. During the Second Triumvirate, Caesar's lieutenant Marc Antony had also harbored designs towards Parthian conquests, but again, these did not end well. It seems that with Octavian's final victories, he was level-headed and personally detached enough to see that an expedition eastwards was not in Rome's interest. (Btw, he eventually struck a deal with the Parthians restoring the lost legionary standards of Crassus back to Rome.)  Although later Claudius expanded into the British Isles and Trajan into Dacia, the Empire more or less stayed within its current boundaries. In the Imperial Eras (Principate & Dominate) ambitious Romans were more interested in seizing the Purple than expanding the borders.    ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that the Middle East was pretty much a barrier to their further expansion due to the very different climate and tropical diseases and the very strong military. Further south into Africa would also have been incredibly difficult and they also wouldn't expect to find anything there. Central Africa was still uncivilized and unexplored.  That leaves Britain and northern Europe where they met their match- the barbarian tribes. If they mounted a properly executed and well thought out invasion, they might have been able to cross the Rhine river that separated the Germanic tribes from them. If they wanted to subjugate Britain, they could as well but it was quite chilly further north.  Another possible entry would be the steppes ruled by the nomads but that would have left them weakened militarily because Roman troops were extremely vulnerable to horse archers. I think they could have cut a swath through all the way to India (following the footsteps of Alexander the Great) and be able to conquer it using the same tactics against Carthage since India had a lot of war elephants as well.
