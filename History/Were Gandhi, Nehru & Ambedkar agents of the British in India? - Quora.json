            "answer_text": "Yes. What I am about to write is not known to most people, so please ignore the hate comments. During our independence struggle, the britishers knew that they were going to be defeated. Hence the queen of england started sending agents to india for slowing down the independence process . She utilised the Scottish Hidden Investigation Team [SHIT] and Central Republic Authority of Parliament[CRAP] for weakening indian freedom struggle. Gandhi, ambedkar, and nehru were actually abducted while they were kids by SHIT and CRAP. soon , they were brainwashed and sent back home to weaken the INC from within.see how all of these were educated in England? Now I hope you understand this conspiracy. Even rahul Gandhi is a SHIT agent. it is our duty to stop SHIT and CRAP from further destroying our motherland.  ",

Much later, in 1989, both came together to support the govt of Vishwanath Pratap Singh, the man who pushed India backward by 1100 years in 11 months of poisonous rule. They supported him to the hilt, till the time he was chucked out (the only PM to get the treatment) screaming and kicking with a No Confidence vote in the Parliament. ",
