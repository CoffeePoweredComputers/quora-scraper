            "answer_text": "Finland, though had no border disputes with Soviet Union. After the fall of Czardom, the Bolshevik government immediately granted freedom to Finland through a decree on December 31st, 1917 and ratified by Soviet supreme executive body on January 4th, 1918. Now let us consider a few facts, ever since the first worker\u2019s state came into existence, the imperialist, bourgeois nations like US, British Empire, France, Holland, Belgium, Spain, Japan saw USSR as a threat and sent their armies to quell the Bolshevik revolution, which were defeated by the Red Army. The Finnish government of the 1930s had warm relationships with Nazi Germany, about which the Soviet government had no qualms that it will eventually attack Soviet Union, as Hitler had expressed it in his writings and speeches. Leningrad (formerly St. Petersburg) was precariously close to the border with Finland and Soviet authorities were concerned that should Finland fall to Germans, the security of Leningrad city would be threatened. The Soviet government made series of diplomatic moves like offering a mutual Soviet-Finnish assistance pact and willing to ceded far more land to Finland in northern Karelia than what they were actually asking the Finnish government to give up. The Finnish government was not willing to make any concessions. Probably they were egged on to adopt a stubborn attitude towards Soviet demand by western imperialist nations, who were always trying to make the things hard for Soviet Union. Needless to say, with time running out, Soviet Union had no other option but to adopt military alternative, which did not end well for Finland as they lost more territory to Soviet Union than they had initially demanded and had to pay war indemnities. Though both France and Britain had promised Finns aid but they just sat and enjoyed the ring side view. Their intention was to see how well prepared was Soviet Army and Finns unwittingly let themselves be used as \u201cuseful idiots\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "To defend herself. Here\u2019s map of the Soviet demands and i have drawn Mannerheim line on top of the picture with black color.  By giving the land Soviets demanded would have meant that about half of the Mannerheim line would be either in Soviet side or untenable as defense because it was too close to Soviet border. To make that decision, finns should have trusted Soviet Union 100% and considering that Soviets just invaded Poland jointly with Nazi Germany, finns weren\u2019t anywhere near 100% trust(not that they would have been even without it). Also shown in the map that border offers that finns made that would have moved the border from 30km to 50km away from Leningrad. These weren\u2019t acceptable to Soviet Union. Acceptable decision was to break non-aggression pact, invade Finland and start up puppet government Finnish Democratic Republic - Wikipedia. ",
