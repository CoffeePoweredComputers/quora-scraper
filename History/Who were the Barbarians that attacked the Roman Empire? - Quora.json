            "answer_text": "In the 4th century, due to the Hun invasion of Europe, a population migration took place. The Visigoths (a Germanic people with close ties to the Roman Empire in the past) led by Fritigern and Alaviv demanded the right to refuge in the empire for fear of invaders.  The Visigoths revolted against Roman abuses and defeated them at the Battle of Adrianople in 378, with the eastern emperor Valens killed. In 382, \u200b\u200bhowever, Theodosius I concluded a treaty (foedus) with the Goths. The Visigoths gained autonomy within the empire, as federates of the Roman Empire. In this sense, they had to support the Romans, and their appetites received positions subordinated to the Roman commanders. Alaric, a Gothic leader, a great military commander and politician entered the political games of the great powers, Constantinople and Rome, being for a long time an ally of the Western Empire. When he no longer agreed with these powers and did not receive what he wanted, he invaded with his armies Greece, Italy, and attacked the great cities of the time\u2026 He besieged Rome three times (between 408 and 410) and the third time conquered. Eventually, Rome, weakened by internal conflicts and the decadence it reached, was fragmented by various Germanic tribes, but which in many ways were 'Romanized', being in long diplomatic, military and commercial contact with the empire.  The term \u2018barbarian\u2019 lost its initial meaning, for the Romans barbarian was someone who lived outside Rome. But they were not savages. In reality, the Romans, a very adaptable people owe a lot to these barbarians. ",

            "answer_text": "The word Barbarians is often misunderstood. The word Barbarian simply means foreigner . So who attacked the roman empire? Well it couldnt be the highlanders because they were not barbarians .heathans maybe but not barbarians. Could be them pesky Muslims. You know if it were not for the flea that invaded europe riding on the backs of little mice and spreding bubonic plague all over the place that ended the roman Empire, the romans never would had allowed islam too rise when it did. They would had extinguished that fire like right now. But alas the plague decimated the roman empire and upwards of 1/2 of the population of europe died due to bubonic plague. The flea is the barbarians that attacked the roman Empire. And they won. ",
