            "answer_text": "I read something interesting that is vaguely related. Apparently, while studying, if you keep sniffing a particular scent, your brain will link the material and the smell together. I am guessing the same thing happens with fragrances, where you associate some long forgotten memory with the smell subconsciously, and smelling the smell causes your brain to remember the memory. ",

            "answer_text": "Your brain stored memories through everything you touch, experience, taste, smell, see and others. That is the function of the brain. If such memory makes you happy, then when you smell certain things, memories flashes out. It is the concept of brain reminding you that you have been experiencing such thing previously. It is the brain function to open the closet and let the memory fly into your brains. Brain is very amazing in its way. We need it the same way we need all our organs. They even stored what our organs are doing in daily basis and recorded the failure too. ",
