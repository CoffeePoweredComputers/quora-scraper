The number of old people will increase this already happens and the government won't find any other way to save their economy other than welcoming immigrants to avoid any economical crises. They are now paying money to old people what causes them to have an economic deficit because there is no much productivity in exchange for what is spent on the elderly. Like one man works For ten men whom need subsidies from the government, can this man cover the government\u2019s debts and also support the elderly? NO EDIT: They also need someone to pay their taxes as citizens and that's why they get the same rights as citizens, but not really! They still face racism from them and my humble assumptions is because They feel the failure of their sovereignty over their lands simply because they were only born on that land . ",
