            "answer_text": "This maybe a matter of opinion, but you will use a smartphone more often than a computer, even though a computer is much more versitile. . Computers can do almost everything a smartphone can do, and MORE (except fit in your pocket, which is debatable, and make calls over 2G, also debatable) Smartphones can do many things similar to a computer, but their usefulness extends beyound a computer due to portability - replacing your watch, a phone, diary, web-book, gameboy, ipod, etc etc. . Ofc you will not be able to do \u2018serious work related activities\u2019 like word, exel, powerpoint (even though these may or maynot exist in the app stores) because power and display size is required to aide productivity. Smartphones just too small and not powerful enough to do the crunching you desire. They may offer half cut word / excel / etc. but you will take twice as long (or longer) to do the same job than on a computer. . IMO a smartphone is probably a better buy than a computer, but you need to know why you want a device before you buy it \u2026 a smartphone isnt a good choice if youre going to be going to UNI and need something that can install programs and print out 100\u2019s of pages of work.

If you are not a Developer: buy a smartphone if you just want to do basic tasks like word processing, email, and internet when you are on the go. or JUST BUY BOTH if your developing games expect to buy a Computer for $1,000. (if you don\u2019t buy a Computer for at least $1,000 you are not a developer, don\u2019t waste your time thinking you are a real programmer). Development is expensive. but since computers are getting less expensive than by all means hook it up, if you can find something for less than 1k, there are machines for 500 but really what's the point in that crap? If your not developing games then buy a laptop computer for $300 and a smartphone for $40. At least $300 will get you a decent gaming experience LOL but not really. No fool in their right mind who knows gaming buys cheap hardware because they know framerates drop and gaming sucks on cheap-ass machines. Cheap developers buy this for $500  Smart Developers buy awesome gear like this for $1,500  Because they know that it will last a long time and you can also do production with it. But if you\u2019re new and have no money to consider alternatives that are cheaper and have less power and trust you will regret wasting money on a cheap system. ",

            "answer_text": "I live with that dilemma everyday. I currently have only a smartphone. It's a long story, but suffice it to say that I became separated from a very powerful Mac computer about five years ago. And having worked in the computer industry since the seventies, I've pretty much always had at least a fairly high end computer. So I suffer \u201cseparation syndrome\" almost everyday. And in the process of becoming separated from my computer, I also became separated from pretty much everything else I owned, including my home. Which means there's currently no way I can afford to purchase another computer. That said, having a smartphone has turned out to be my savior, since it functions as my communications device, my computer, my fitness tracker, and my entertainment center. So having lived both \u201clives\", if you can only afford either a computer or a smartphone, but not both, the smartphone is definitely the way to go. And if that's the case, I would go with an Android device, since much in the way Windows can run software that Mac OS can't (yes, I am fully aware that Macs are dual boot, but iPhones aren't), there are a lot more apps for Android than iOS, especially where tools and utilities are concerned.

            "answer_text": "Both are smart moves. Depends on your or your families requirements. Here in India we buy whatever for long term basis. If its a computer than will be used by all the family members. If its a smartphone will be use by 1\u20132 person in the family. So for what purpose you're buying these gadgets. For applying jobs and general use of pc as computer is a good choice. Although it will be a junk sort of, taking space and heavy to carry (Laptops). Need plenty of wirings, WiFi and rigid in movements. Costly and bulk. Needs additional cost to work properly. Sometimes recurring costs. Good for deisger, Office secretarial work, data entry, school projects, etc. Smartphone is small device with a sim card. Doesn't need much space or equipments for setup. You can easily carry it in your hand or pocket. Smartphone is instant solution to all Google search, location maps, pictures,, blogs, social media, GPS, ticket bookings, flights details, hotel confirmation, online shopping, phone calls, torch, camera, calculator, calendar, games, ebook reader, portable movie device, instant video camera, mobile wallet, banking apps, RTA apps, and many more. All it needs a simple charging for few hours to work for 20\u201324 hours. So here is the catch. A smartphone is much cheaper in price, can be used to view pdf files, excel sheet, Applying jobs, playing games, making notes, conversations, scanner, etc all within the size of your hand. PC or laptop is good for editing works, writing long theories, working daily on spas apps. Costly to maintain. I have given you the choice choose wisely. A good computer price starts from Aed 1,100/- till Aed 9,500/-. Where as a good mobile phone costs only Aed 299-799/- budget branded andriod phones. Xiaomi, Oppo, Samsung, Sony Xperia, HTC, LG are few brands in smartphone. ",

Imagine something went wrong with your newest smartphone (For an example : the firmware has errors , your smartphone couldn\u2019t bootup) , What will you do while you don\u2019t have a computer? With a computer (and an internet connection too!) you\u2019ll be able to re-flash your phone\u2019s firmware without going outside and buying a new firmware upgrade from others. Smartphones are able to do what a computer is able to do , but smartphones are able to become stolen by thefts , easier than a computer. You are able to do a lot with only a smart phone , but with low-specs phone, no , a computer is really recommended. Phones are good for everyday\u2019s usage (not for productivity though) , because phone\u2019s CPU is not as good as a computer\u2019s CPU. Hope it help. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends entirely on your needs and tastes. Most things you can do on a computer you can also do on many modern smartphones. The question is mostly, what kind of tasks you do on a regular basis and what type of interface you are most comfortable with. For me personally, I have a desktop computer and a smartphone. Don\u2019t have a tablet or laptop. I highly prefer sitting comfortably at my desk using a keyboard and mouse and a fast computer with terabytes of storage I don\u2019t have to worry about filling up anytime soon, a fast stable wired Internet connection that does not slow down if there are too many people around, and a 22 inch monitor as opposed to the tiny 6 inch screen of my phone. I do a few tasks that are far easier and better done in the computer than in the cell phone such as simple video editing, photo post-processing and working with documents such as Excel spreadsheets, letters and such, easier to work with in a large screen and physical keyboard. There are only three applications found both in my Windows computer and my Android phone. One is a weather radar application, another is an astronomy application and MS Excel. I hardly use Excel in the phone but I have it in case I need to access one important spreadsheet that I need to use often that is stored in the cloud and available anywhere to both devices. For social media I only do Facebook and much prefer to do so in my desktop computer. Spent some time several times during the day and not being constantly glued to Facebook on my cell phone. I really hate being constantly being bombarded by notifications in my cell phone so most applications are either limited on what notifications they generate or are completely restricted from doing so. For watching videos online, I also prefer the desktop computer because I can see them in my 40 inch TV rather than the 6 inch display in my phone. My phone spends most of the day on top of the (computer) desk, night stand or in my pocket. I do use it a lot for navigation in my car via Android Auto. So in my case, it is wise to have both. And they are used for different purposes. ",

            "answer_text": "Between a computer or a smartphone, it depends on the workload really. Even CAD operations can be done on a smartphone these days, but trying to draft a multi-storey building on a smartphone is impractical to say the least. And before I bought my computer, I was 100% reliant on my smartphone, even though I was restricted to just games, calls, texts, and social media. Maybe some office software use like WPS Office (especially when running D&D or other TRPGs). Computers are power houses compared to smartphones, and getting it can unlock so many more things that you can do than smartphones ever will. But just because they\u2019re better in almost every way, doesn\u2019t necessarily make them the better buy; sometimes the portability is more important than most other features. If you\u2019re always on the go, and don\u2019t mind keeping things lean by comparison, go smartphones. If you need to do a lot more \u2014 and I do mean a LOT more \u2014 and don\u2019t mind the lack of portability (or in the case of laptops, a much bulkier but still portable device), go computer. ",

If you want to use the pc for some tasks that require a lot of processing and graphics power, like video editing, or some office work which does not require you to be on the move all the time, a pc will be much better suited. You can\u2019t type that well on a smartphone. Now you can attach a keyboard to a smartphone, but it won\u2019t have a large display and the typing speed can be somewhat limited. I really think a smartphone is more an appliance that works well for situations when you can\u2019t use a laptop, but still need to check mail or send a reply, take photos etc. These days you can combine a phone via windows 10 and send photos via wi-fi to the pc. If you need portability you should consider a laptop, however a desktop is cheaper and can have more power than a laptop for the same amount of money. Laptops can be quite expensive in comparison to a regular PC, but basic models will be good for office work and internet browsing. ",
