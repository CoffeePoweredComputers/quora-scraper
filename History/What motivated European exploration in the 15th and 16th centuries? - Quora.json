This was the reason for Columbus\u2019s voyage, he was trying to reach China not knowing that there was an entire continent in his way. Later on, the impetus for Spanish and Portuguese exploration in the New World was the desire for gold and silver which they realised was rather plentiful there. The Portuguese also sent several expeditions to find a way round Africa with the aim of reaching India and China. They finally succeded in doing that and paving the way for the French, Dutch and subsequently the English to sail round Africa to India and the Far East establishing trading stations and colonial posessions. Private companies were set up to run this trade and did so for more than 250 years. The English East India Company, (EEC) ran most of India as a private empire while the Dutch East India Company (VOC) ran most of what is now Indonesia in the same way. The French and Portuguese also set up trading companies in India but eventually lost them to the English. ",

( Suez Canal, Image courtesy: Google) After the Ottomans have gained the control of Suez Canal, it was difficult for Europeans to trade with Indians. So the only way were the Arab traders. But this lead to a hike in the prices. So many European states decided to start a search for new sea route to Indies (West called India as Indies).
