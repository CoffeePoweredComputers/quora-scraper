            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s how you find out: go to www.biblegateway.comIn the drop-down menu, select a translation you like. If you don\u2019t know, then \u201cNew International Version (NIV)\u201d is good. If you prefer a different language, scroll down and you might find it there.In the left window, where it says Enter keyword, passage, or topic type death. Hit \u201center\u201dThis will find you all mentions of the word \u201cdeath\u201d in the entire Bible. But in the grey bit immediately to the right of the verses, you\u2019ll see a \u201cfilter by\u201d option.In the \u201cfilter by\u201d menu, click New Testament.Here\u2019s the shortcut that does that for you: BibleGateway - : death That\u2019s all the mentions of the word \u201cdeath\u201d in the NIV translation of the New Testament. It just shows each \u201cverse\u201d that contains that word. In case you\u2019re not at all familiar with the Bible, a verse is about the length of a sentence, although it\u2019s often just part of a sentence. When the Bible was written, it wasn\u2019t divided into chapters or verses, but they were put in by translators to make it easier to read and so that before the Internet people could give an \u201caddress\u201d for any part of the Bible they wanted. If a verse looks interesting to you, click \u201cin context\u201d or \u201cfull chapter\u201d underneath it. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m an atheist and I don\u2019t think the Bible is a great place to learn anything interesting about death. ",
