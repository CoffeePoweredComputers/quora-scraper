            "answer_text": "Briefly and just barely. After taking the Abbassid capital at Baghdad and the Ayyubid capital at Damascus, the Mongols turned their attention south to the remaining major power in the region, the Mamluks of Egypt. This did entail moving towards the Levant coast, out of the deeper interior of Syria into territory which is more conventionally thought of as the Holy Land. Mamluk and Mongol forces met at Ain Jalut, about half way between Acre and Jerusalem, just on the western side of the Jordan river. The Mamluks decimated the Mongol force and, for a variety of reasons, that was pretty much it for Mongol expansion into the Middle East. They kept what territory they had to the northeast, but went no further. ",
