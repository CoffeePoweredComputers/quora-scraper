            "answer_text": "Absolutely, the world is becoming more nationalistic while the liberal elites become ever less so. This is the group that puts nothing above themselves\u2014not God, country, or family. More specifically, at least the West is becoming more populist/ethnonationalist. This is because liberals are notorious for not governing in the best interests of their native Western middle and working classes. We believe that our countries belong to us\u2014called republicanism\u2014and that the only legitimate ruling classes are those who do occasionally place the public good ahead of their own. It was none other than Karl Marx who said that reform is what the elites engage in to maintain their hold on power. The problem is that the bunch governing us consider non-elite whites so subhuman that we aren\u2019t worthy of being compromised with. Unless the bunch ruling us is thrown out of power, or straightens out, as Marx noted, violence is the only alternative. The days of liberals elites having to oppress others to get rich are rapidly coming to an end, whether we are talking about Third World peoples or the native Western middle and working classes. ",

            "answer_text": "Only certain countries. Primarily, countries that have had their demographic significantly changed by policies of greater immigration and integration. European countries are particularly vulnerable to such policies, which would explain why there appears to be a rises in nationalistic political parties coming to the fore of European politics. The problem is that many countries have seen a need for greater immigration and integration as a means of maintaining an economically productive workforce. However, what the governments have failed to understand is the impact that will be felt by the indigenous populations. In certain countries such as the UK, Germany, France etc. indigenous populations feel they have become a minority and, rightly or wrongly, view immigration as a threat to their national identity. The only way for them to voice their concerns is to elect political leaders who are more nationalistic and who promise to stem the tied of immigration. This situation is leading, Europe in particular, down a path of social conflict. The traditional politicians want to encourage greater levels of immigration and integration - they want to develop a true multi-cultural society. So, in order to counter the nationalistic tendencies of indigenous populations, politicians will often brand nationalist, and the political parties they support, as racist. This in turn creates a very bad environment for meaningful discussion of the issues of concern. We have established, and somewhat reckless, politicians accusing a large proportion of its population as being racist, which automatically sets people with different views against the nationalist view on the grounds of racism. It is this attitude that will eventually cause major rifts among European nations and could, if left unchecked, cause a break up of the European Union. Countries outside of the EU are less prone to the development of nationalistic tendencies among the masses. This is because many countries do actively control levels of immigration to better suit the current demographic of their respective populations. The strange anomaly is that these countries are never labeled as racist by those countries that have seemingly uncontrolled levels of immigration. This term is only reserved for political parties and their supporters within countries that have a tendency to have more open borders. ",
