            "answer_text": "Wonderful question Mr. Muhammad Mustafa. To understand the term \u201ccivilization-state\u201d we have to understand first what civilization is? By a simple digging we got Civilization is The stage of human social development and organization which is considered most advanced. With some synonyms: human development, advancement, progress, enlightenment, edification, culture, cultivation, refinement, sophistication, the society, culture, and way of life of a particular area. All the above synonyms and the basic definition direct us to understand first the stage of human social development. In this regard we have the great work of Abraham Maslow in the form of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs. If we visit him on describing the stages of growth in humans, he used the terms \"physiological\", \"safety\", \"belongingness\" and \"love\", \"esteem\", \"self-actualization\", and \"self-transcendence\" to describe the pattern that human motivations generally move through. In this pretext if we see the hunter gatherers we can put safely them in the stage of fulfilling physiological needs such as food, sex, and leisure. Next stage of Maslow's hierarchy of needs is safety and belongingness. Exactly at this stage developments of nation-states flourish. After fulfilling these basic requirements in the hierarchy of needs comes love\", \"esteem\", These two terms fits in the social organization which is considered advanced. The society which reached at the human social development stage of \"self-actualization\", and \"self-transcendence\" considered most advanced. In this stage systems for dealing with outsiders, without harming interests of their own society evolved. Exactly this stage called \u201ccivilization-state\u201d. Nation-states deals with the physiological\", \"safety\", \"belongingness\", \"love \u201cand \"esteem aspects of human needs. Hope now we understood how civilization-state is different from nation-states. To quickly understand the entire picture here is the  Maslow's hierarchy of needs, represented as a pyramid with the more basic needs at the bottom. image courtesy: Maslow's hierarchy of needs ",

            "answer_text": "Civilization is much more wide term then Nation and state because it includes society its history and culture. As India is an ancient civilization but Present Nation of India came into existence after independence from British Empire. However functioning of particular State also depends on its historical background and culture. In this respect concept of Civilization becomes important Concept of political system insists on Holistic view of a state and thus understanding of society and its culture becomes much more important. Structures of government can be borrowed but its functioning and process is definitely decided by the behavior and culture of People. ",
