            "answer_text": "whew, I am going to take a big chance here. Being an historian I refuse to \u201ccensor\u201d the historical record. So\u2026 Here are some examples I got. I got them with a simple \u201cimages\u201d search from my browser. I typed in \u201cAnti Japanese Imagry from WW II\u201d This stuff is not hidden. It is not a mystery. It is NOT pleasant. It is very very real. Art work and imagery, have a huge psychological impact in any century.    Here is an article:Anti-Japanese propaganda in WWII Unexpectedly that same search also turned up some examples of Japanese anti Western art work as well.Roosevelt as a grasping monster, Note the resemblance to Boris Karlof as Frankenstein\u2019s Monster.   No accident there.  Japan coming to the rescue of Asian peoples oppressed by European Colonial Empires.  Big bowler wearing Brit chopping off the fingers of a Hindu colonial. Imagery need not be a total LIE. It can be a fiction that represents a reflection of a reality. I would wager this image accurately depicts the sentiments of many of President Trump\u2019s supporters.  Now in this latter case, it doesn\u2019t really matter to Trump supporters if he is a good man or a bad one, just that he is disruptive to a status quo that his supporters despise. But, honestly, this image could be just as motivating to those who support that status quo as to those who oppose it. This example, right up there, is one of the best examples of the difference between \u201ca truth\u201d, and \u201ca fact\u201d. There is not one single fact in that image, yet it represents a very real, and very moving, \u201ctruth\u201d. Better, it doesn\u2019t really matter which direction it moves you in. If you hate Trump this is likely why. He is stormy, disruptive, unpleasant, and uncaring. If you love Trump you may well support him because he is, stormy, disruptive, unpleasant, and uncaring, \u2026 to his enemies. Whoever did this piece was a real student of the art of political, propaganda and psychological warfare. The highest quality of psychological warfare works best when it can hit the intended audience at that level. This is very very disturbing stuff, but psychological warfare is often war at its worst.

            "answer_text": "Psychological warfare is the planned tactical use of propaganda, threats, and other non-combat techniques during wars, threats of war, or periods of geopolitical unrest to mislead, intimidate, demoralize, or otherwise influence the thinking or behavior of an enemy. An Introduction to Psychological Warfare, From Genghis Khan to ISIS Hitler\u2019s initial moves Hitler used propaganda (and illegal action, including murder) to influence the thinking of Austrians, leveraging propaganda to convince Austrians to welcome invaders with welcome arms. Hitler used threats of war to convince the West to be complicit in his tearing Czechoslovakia in two, and his subsequent invasion and occupation of the rest of the country. Hitler leveraged propaganda, threats of war, and the psychological weapon of deceit to influence his enemies. He depended too much on the power of the threat of war to sway his enemies, and he finally purchased what his threats had promised- war.  Operation Fortitude The Allies misled the Nazis about where they\u2019d invade. They made an entire dummy army, faked troop movements, and even brought Patton along.  Operation Fortitude - Wikipedia Banzai charge Men charging you with swords and bayonets, screaming \u201cBanzaiiiiiiii!!!!!\u201d as they sprint towards you would have intimidated most. Banzai charges were usually ineffective and led to large numbers of Japanese casualties, but they were still terrifying.  Banzai charge - Wikipedia Stuka dive bombers Although inspiring fear wasn\u2019t part of the design, the sound the Stuka made as it descended was terrifying and would both intimidate and demoralize.  Junkers Ju 87 - Wikipedia Savage Barbarossa Hitler intended to use extreme violence to sway Ukrainians and others. Partisans and Jews were executed wholesale, civilians were murdered and raped, and homes were looted and destroyed. It turned potential allies into vengeful enemies. His attempt to use fear and violence to sway his enemies blew up in his face.  Operation Barbarossa - Wikipedia Propaganda leaflets Leaflets were used to intimidate soldiers and civilians into surrendering.         ",
