            "answer_text": "They can\u2019t be compared. The atmosphere of the Earth is paper thin whereas the whole of Jupiter is gaseous. Which makes for a lot of gas, given that the Great Red Spot itself is larger than Earth :  On Earth any low altitude wind, i.e. any air flow that doesn\u2019t follow the rotation of the planet, is eventually slowed down by friction with the solid landscape. Which in turn creates friction with higher winds, so that in the end, the whole atmosphere rotates more or less nicely with the Earth (except in the highest layers). On Jupiter, with no solid surface to offer a consistent friction, things are very different. The gas is free to rotate at different speeds depending on latitudes, even in opposite directions! Consequently, Jupiter and other gas giants don\u2019t rotate uniformly at all latitudes, as seen on this timelapse by Voyager 1 :  The spot is confined by a modest eastward jet stream to its south and a very strong westward one to its north. Though winds around the edge of the spot peak at ~120 metres per second (432 kilometres per hour), currents inside it seem stagnant, with little inflow or outflow. No doubt this endless influx of opposite winds plays a role in the longevity of the GRS, but I believe the exact conditions inside the storm are largely unknown. According to the same page, the storm is steadily shrinking : At the start of 2004, the Great Red Spot had approximately half the longitudinal extent it had a century ago, when it reached a size of 40,000 kilometres. At the present rate of reduction it would become circular by 2040. It is not known how long the spot will last, or whether the change is a result of normal fluctuations.

            "answer_text": "While the Great Red Spot bares some resemblance to Earth\u2019s hurricanes, it is of a very different nature than any Earth storm. It is a large scale vortex, larger than the Earth, trapped between two extremely powerful jet-streams travelling in opposite directions:  (Image Credit: NASA/JPL/Voyager 1[1]) However, the key to its longevity over its many other smaller-scale vortices is the unseen up-welling of heat from the interior in this location. We only have a very rudimentary idea of what Jupiter\u2019s internal convection is like, but its entirely possible and even likely that there are large scale vortexes that live underneath Jupiter\u2019s cloudtops in between vertical convective zones. That being said, the Great Red Spot has been diminishing in size, and could be gone within the next twenty years, depending on whether or not this diminishing in size is a cyclical pattern or not.
