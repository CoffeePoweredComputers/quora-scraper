            "answer_text": "They didn\u2019t. Most people could not afford stock prices in the 1920s, though surely some \u201cinvested\u201d in the stock market. The vast majority of price moves in the stock market are not instituted by \u201cinvestors,\u201d they\u2019re caused by traders buying and selling over relatively short periods of time, sometimes as little as less than five minutes. One history book I read on the Great Depression hypothesized that there were fewer than one million traders actively engaged in buying a selling stocks at the time of the crash. Further, you couldn\u2019t get margin unless you had sufficient income or enough experience trading (not unlike today, btw), and so \u201cordinary people\u201d weren\u2019t buying on margin. ",

In 1929, and for several preceding years, the general public level of investment information and knowledge was very meager compared to now. There was no prior depression as large as the coming great depression. The economy was strong, people were getting rich on the stock market, and even the most prominent economists of the day saw prosperity in the future. ",
