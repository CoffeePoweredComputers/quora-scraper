            "answer_text": "By Italians you can mean two things. One is \u2018citizens of the country called Italy\u2019 (which was founded in 1861), the other one is \u2018inhabitants of the Italian peninsula\u2019. You can mean two different things also when you say \u2018Romans\u2019: inhabitants of the city called Rome (from its foundation to modern days) or citizens of the ancient state of Rome. Rome began as a city state in central Italy (as in: Italian peninsula), inhabited by people closely related to a population called Latini. At the time in Italy there were tens of different populations: Etruscans, Gauls, Venetii, Carni, Liguri, Sannites, Sabini, Siceli and so on, beside the city states of Greek settlers in the South. As the Roman Republic, it grew and conquered neighbouring cities and population and eventually all of the Italian peninsula; during Caesar\u2019s rule it conquered Gaul (modern day France, more or less) and the Hyberian peninsula; in the time of the emperors also Egypt and all of Northern Africa, the Middle East, Anatolia, part of Great Britain\u2026 So there was only a brief moment in which one of the two definitions of Italians (inhabitants of the Italian peninsula) coincided with one of the two definitions of Romans (citizens of the Roman state). But before that moment, you had Italians that weren\u2019t citizens of Rome; and after that, you had Roman citizens that didn\u2019t come from Italy but from all over the world. For instance, the Roman philosopher Seneca was born in Cordoba (modern day Spain); the Roman emperor Constantine, in modern day Serbia; and also Saint Paul, born a Jew in modern day Turkey, was a Roman citizen. So to call Romans \u2018ancient Italians\u2019 would be wildly inaccurate. ",

            "answer_text": "This is probably because of the fall of the Roman Empire. After the fall of the (western) Roman Empire, what we know today as Italy was divided into city-states. There is no direct through line from the Roman Empire to Modern Italy as there is from Ancient Greece to Modern Greece. Let\u2019s take Ancient and Modern Greece as an example. The people of Greece, since the Persian wars, have considered themselves Greek. Modern Greek is a direct descendant of Ancient Greek, Greeks still put an emphasis on hospitality as the ancients did, and though they have changed throughout the ages (as any civilization is ought to do) there is a direct line from Ancient Greece to Modern Greece by way of language, cultural affiliation, and societal values. This is not the same for Ancient Romans and Modern Italians. Italian is part of the Romantic family of languages (a family that has Latin as a \u201cparent\u201d) but it is not a direct descendant of Latin. There are few similarities between Romans and Modern Italians when it comes to societal values, and, importantly, it is only recently that people who live in Italy have called themselves Italian. For a good deal of history, they haven\u2019t been Italian, they\u2019ve instead been a citizen of Naples, or of Venice, of Rome, so on and so forth. Another thing is that the Romans called themselves Romans. They took the name from their city and the founder of their city, Romulus. This is probably the biggest reason why we call them Romans and not Ancient Italians. As Historians, we should listen to the people of that time, and if they call themselves Romans, we probably should too. ",
