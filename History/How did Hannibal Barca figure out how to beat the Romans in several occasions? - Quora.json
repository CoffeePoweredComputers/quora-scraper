            "answer_text": "Educated men have a way of understanding how people work from their tutelage, which acts as a powerful multiplier to experience (or vice versa). According to Dexter Hoyos\u2019s Hannibal\u2019s Dynasty, Hannibal (Barca is not a surname and not an epithet earned) was tutored by a Spartan named Sosylus, which was typical among the elite of the Mediterranean world- Hannibal no doubt was taught Greek classics and would know how to speak this lingua franca himself (and certainly would have helped communicate with the myriad peoples that were employed as mercenaries in his army). This in turn would have allowed him background knowledge of both Greek and Roman warfare that dominated his time, and coupled with how differently other people worked (like his own Carthaginian heritage of small army supplemented by mercenaries, or the raider type of confederate Gauls and Iberians), this gives you an idea of what works and what doesn\u2019t when it comes to, say, fighting Roman legionaries. His access to cavalry also gives valuable insight into the importance of mobility in battles: if you can move forces faster than the enemy can, you can control the tactical scenario, and henceforth decide what goes on, when and where. Ask any military expert.Roman contemporaries on the other hand focused on the heavy infantry (as was their own heritage) and their usage of cavalry was also inferior to that of Carthage (and later Parthians), hard lessons learned only long after the Punic wars; Julius Caesar would hire on Gaul and German cavalry for his army. The three great victories of Hannibal- Ticinus, Trasimene, and Cannae- all involve two critically related elements to Hannibal\u2019s success- mobility and encirclement. You can\u2019t really do either one without the other. Ticinus was more a cavalry skirmish, but all the same the victory was encircling the Romans. Trasimeme was an ambush, but of course requires successful maneuver, and Cannae was a terrific envelopment that first required the cavalry to chase away the Romans\u2019 before closing the Roman centre\u2019s rear. In this respect, you can surmise that Hannibal learned to beat the Romans using just two things- moving fast, and making sure the enemy cannot. Classic military tactic, then and now: a victory is when you keep the enemy from running away, and moving around to seize vantage points, cut off routes of escape or reinforcement, and rapid destruction of hardpoints like artillery batteries or radar sites. For Hannibal\u2019s case, once you know the Romans are more into the slow heavy infantry decisive battle, you know what your options are to negate this weakness, in this case it was a bunch of guys riding fast animals. For some more specific things , I will cite the book Companion to the Punic Wars: \u201cHe had learned that the Roman expected traps in wooded areas but tended to be careless on open ground (Pol. 3.71)\u201d page 243 \u201c\u2026the Roman heavy infantry found itself pressed by enemy infantry in the front and by light-armed troops on the flanks. The hidden cavalry and infantry then sprang into action and charged the Roman army from the rear. The trap worked to perfection, and the Roman army, which hitherto had held its own, was thrown into \u201c confusion and disarray\u201d (3.74). pages 243\u2013244, here it exemplifies Hannibal taking advantage of how the Romans worked- heavy infantry were their forte, so he made sure to play tricks on them. \u201cHannibal again exploited topography, and his opponent\u2019s aggressiveness, at the Battle of Trasimene\u201d. page 244, thanks to scouts and a keen (one!) eye, he knew the land, and also knew the manner in which Romans like to fight. \u201cHe took pains to learn not only about the nature of the surrounding countryside, which was wealthy and a potential source of plunder, but also about Flaminius\u2019 character: he was alleg-edly overconfident and easily provoked (Pol. 3.80)\u201dsame page, he certainly maximized the use of his intelligence network (that which allowed him to traverse the Alps earlier that year). He likewise certainly would have learned how the Romans fought through his alliance with Gallic tribes that fought against (or with) the Romans. The enemy of my enemy is not only my friend, but also a great source of how to defeat said enemy. Hannibal sure knew his shit, and having been educated by a Spartan certainly helped. A Companion to the Punic Wars A plethora of authors write on various topics, including an examination on the tactics of Hannibal on page 242 by Michael Fronda. Hannibal's Dynasty The chapter on Hannibal\u2019s three victories against Rome begins on page 114. ",
