            "answer_text": "In current scenario, castes are irrelevant. Again, genetically, there is not much of a difference, so casteism must not be encouraged. Still, since you asked, here is the response:- Sials, also known as Syal or Sayal, are found among Jats, Rajputs and Khatris. They are found in Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Panjab. Even among Jats, Sial/Syal caste has high reputation. They founded and ruled Jhang for 7 or 8 centuries. They are bonafide residents of Panjab, Himachal, Rajasthan, MP and Haryana. They use titles like Chaudhary and Singh. There are few cities that are named in Rajasthan and British Panjab after their name. They enjoy simple living and were classified as agricultural tribe (synonymous to martial race) by Britishers. ",
