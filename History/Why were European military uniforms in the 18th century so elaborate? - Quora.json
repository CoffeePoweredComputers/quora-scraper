            "answer_text": "during the 18th and 19th century, it was believed to be cowardly if you hid behind a rock for cover, and it was apparently very manly to walk into a blaze of bullets. the uniforms were meant to show power and style, they were made to be seen by the enemy, and to make the other side look like there uniforms are crappy.  another reason many army uniforms at that time had extreme amount of detail is because it was easier for there general or leader to see the different soldiers that are on the battlefield to command and control them easier. Flags were used to signal movements and orders. this is why some uniforms look totally different from each other, for example: the French hussars\u2026  \u2026look totally different from there infantry comrades\u2026  \u2026and the infantry looks totally different from the Gard uniforms.  and so on. but As soon as the rifle became more widespread as the main armament the uniform colors changed to give the individual soldier better camouflage in battle. which is why many uniforms in the latter part of the 19th century was much less colourful than that of those in the earlier part of that century.  (Photo a soldier in the latter part of the 19th century.) ",

            "answer_text": "Quite simply ,Command and Control. The elaborate colorful uniforms were highly visible, which made command and control easier. With the artillery and firearms of the time ,the battle field was usually covered in a thick layer of smoke. The bright colors made it easy to see and control your troops. This was also one reason for the large ,tight formations. The other reason was the relative inaccuracy of the muskets of the time. The large tight formation not only made control easier , it concentrate your fire. With the advent of more accurate weaponry, large formations and colorful uniforms gradually(very gradually)fell out of favor. ",
