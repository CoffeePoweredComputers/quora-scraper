            "answer_text": "I once asked my grandmother (who would know, because she was a Soddie from the Oklahoma Territory) what she thought of all those TV Westerns back in the 1950s. (I was a kid back then, and I loved them.) She just dismissed them with a sniff of disdain and said, \u201cThey\u2019re too clean.\u201d At first I thought she mean just the actors, because looking back they do look pretty well tailored and manicured. But as I later learned, she meant everything! The buildings, the people and especially the streets. Many was the building that would be slapped together, but they were slow about putting on paint. It was scarce in many places. And soon to fall down. The people wore so many layers of clothing, made of linen, wool and muslin, year around - even in summer that they sweated all the time. Can you imagine the body odor? And then there were the streets. Nobody cleaned up after the horses. Or the cattle. Or the pigs. Or the dogs. or the\u2026well you get the picture. Which is why they had boardwalks in front of every building - it was the one place they could count on not being a cesspool every time it rained. So if you are seeing sweating cowboys in a Western - its probably the ONE thing that\u2019s accurate in the whole movie. ",

            "answer_text": "Non-sweaty ones are the inauthentic ones. Most of the films are set in the Southwest or California where 90\u2013110 degree daytime temps in those summer months with the longest daylight for filming are common. So even standing still, in long sleeve shirts, leather vest, tight jeans/pants, leather chaps, high leather boots, and a felt hat a man\u2019s going to sweat. Riding and doing upper body work like roping, shooting, fist fights, gun fights, branding, etc. will have the sweat pouring off of them. Real cowboys had layers of old and fresh sweat, a bandana was often crusty with sweat which takes a lot, as well as deep sweat stains in both cloth and leather (the saddles and boots shaped to the owners by being daily soaked with sweat while in use.) Horses sweat quite a bit too. The neat clean actors in freshly cleaned and unpatched newish apparel and especially new looking hats are the anomalous ones unless they\u2019re a town-based character or cleaned up for church, weddings, funerals, etc.. The real cowboys wore a lot of wool, more than cotton, and full coverage underwear (union suit) that was often wool as well, putting up with a lot of sweating during the day in return for comfort after the sun set\u2026evening and night time temperatures in the West (desert, plains, mountains) can easily get into the 40\u2019s.)
