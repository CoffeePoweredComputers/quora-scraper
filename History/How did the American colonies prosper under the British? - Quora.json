            "answer_text": "When English migrants landed in the colonies they were allocated 40 acres of land. This was deemed adequate to provide for a small family and one or two endentured servants. However, what was also available were vast expanses of forest, which provided limitless amounts of lumber, firewood, wild fowl, deer, furs and even more cultivatable land. This along with low taxes meant that the early settlers literally lived like kings. ",

            "answer_text": "In the beginning the colonies were taxed very lightly by the British government although some taxes were levied by colonial governments. Trade was limited to England and other British colonies, especially in the Caribbean. As the colonials prospered they chafed under the trade restriction and smuggling became common. Eventually, the British government began to notice how prosperous the colonies seamed and decided to impose taxes themselves; this is when the pent up dissatisfaction began to boil over. ",

            "answer_text": "   Originally Parliament banned the export of British currency ie gold guineas, silver shillings & copper pence. So the colonies were not taxed since they had to use Spanish gold escudos & silver pesos.   However Britain got addicted to tea and shipped most of their silver to China. The 13 colonists were taxed less than Brits. So Parliament started imposing taxes. That started the American Revolution. The British lost. Then in 1793 they sent an embassy to China. That didn't work.  They soon discovered a product that was in demand, opium.  ",
