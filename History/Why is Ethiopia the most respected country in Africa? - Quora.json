            "answer_text": "Some people may have reservations on the \u201cmost respected\u201d title. Nonetheless, I believe Ethiopia is at least one of the top contenders for that title due to the following factors. History:a. Ancient Civilization Ethiopia is home to a civilization that extends more than three millennia. Ancient kingdoms that flourished in what is now Ethiopia include Da\u2019amat (also written as D\u2019mt) (10th century BC), Punt (up to 25th century BC by some estimates), and Axum (100 AD-940 AD). The most notable of these ancient kingdoms is the Kingdom of Axum which at its height at times extended across most of present-day Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti,Somalia, Sudan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen.

Sovereignty Ethiopia is the only African country which was never colonized by European colonizers. It defended its sovereignty by fighting the Italians twice (first at the Battle of Adwa in 1896, then during WWII from 1936\u201341). Due to this Ethiopia is considered as a beacon of freedom for Africans and black people across the world. As a result, many African countries have adopted the tri-color Ethiopian flag in different forms. 10 Countries Who Were Never Colonized by Europeans Why are the flags of African countries so similar? WHY DO AFRICAN FLAGS ALL HAVE SIMILAR COLOURS  Battle of Adwa (1896,the first victory of a black army against a modern European colonizer)  Emperor Menelik II (The King who led the Ethiopian army to victory at the Battle of Adwa) 2. Religion Ethiopia has a very important and unique place in Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. It is the first African country to adopt all these three Abrahamic religions. Unlike other African countries who accept Christianity through European colonizers/missionaries in late 18th and early 19th centuries, Christianity entered Ethiopia and adopted as a state religion back in 4th century AD during the rule of King Ezana; the religion was practiced way before that among the general populace though it was not state religion. In fact, the name \u201cEthiopia\u201d is mentioned in Holy Bible many times. On the other hand, Islam entered to the country when Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) himself was alive around 615 AD. In fact, the first Hijra (religious pilgrimage in Islam) was conducted to Ethiopia when the first believers of Islam were persecuted by pagan rulers (of Qurayish tribe?) in Middle East. Harar, a town in eastern Ethiopia, is considered to be the 4th holiest Muslim city (next to Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem). Jews (locally called Beta Israelis/Felashas) lived in Ethiopia for more than 15 centuries. Ethiopia in the Bible Islam in Ethiopia - Wikipedia The History of Ethiopian Jewry | My Jewish Learning  St. George Church of Lalibela (12th century AD,one of 11 monolithic churches at Lalibela, each carved from single stone)   St. Mary of Zion Church in Axum (believed to contain the original Ark of Covenant given by God Himself to Moses)  The Grand Anwar Mosque in Addis Ababa (biggest mosque in Ethiopia)  Al Nejashi Mosque (Africa\u2019s 1st mosque built in 7th century AD) 3. Pan-Africanism As a beacon of freedom, Ethiopia played a key role in promoting Pan Africanism. Before other African countries achieved their independence, Ethiopia was their voice in the League of Nations and United Nations. Without Ethiopia, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) would have been difficult, if not impossible, to realize. Emperor Haile Selassie I mediated divided Pan Africanists at the time (Monorovia and Casablanca group) and convinced them to come to Ethiopia and find OAU in May 1963. Consequently, the headquarters of the then OAU (now African Union/AU) is found in Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa. In the diplomatic world, Addis Ababa is now the gate way to Africa as a seat of the AU. Addis is to Africa as Brussels is to Europe.  African Union Headquarters, Addis Ababa 4. Culture Ethiopia has also some unique cultural features from other African countries. It is the only country in Africa with its own writing system (the Ge\u2019ez alphabet), its own calendar (fun fact: we have 13 months & it is now 2012 in Ethiopia), its own number system,indigenous-only language as official/federal government language (Amharic). All African countries, except Ethiopia, use a non-African language along with their indigenous language as official language.  The Ge\u2019ez alphabet  Ethiopian numbers 5. Other factors There are also other factors such as the country\u2019s rich archaeological, natural and geographic endowments for Ethiopia to have a respected position in Africa. It is, for instance, home to the largest number of UNESCO-registered World Heritage Sites in Africa; the source of Blue Nile which contributes 85% of the water of Nile, the longest river in the world & the life line for Egypt. Militarily, the Ethiopian army is one of the most powerful and efficient armies in Africa. According to Global Fire Power\u2019s ranking for 2016, the Ethiopian army is the 3rd most powerful in Africa despite annual budget of just 340 MILLION USD, which is a fraction of other armies\u2019 budget. As a comparison, the military budget of Egypt and Algeria (the top 2) in that year was $4 BILLION & $10.5 BILLION; respectively. South African and Nigerian armies, despite having $4.6 BILLION and $2.3 BILLION budget, lagged behind Ethiopian army. Top 20 Most Powerful Militaries In Africa 2016 update: in 2018, Ethiopian army\u2019s strength slipped to 6th place in Africa as per Global Fire Power ranking. But, the point about its undeniable strength and efficiency remains valid.

            "answer_text": "That's an interesting question. But to be honest, Ethiopia is not the most respected country in Africa and there is no one country that is most respected in Africa if I'm being objective but there countries which are respected in Africa. Those countries are as follows Egypt, Algeria, Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. Egypt has always maintained his ties with Sub-Saharan nations, financing various development projects in the continent. Also, Egypt is home to one of the earliest civilization of humankind it is part of the reason most African countries do respect Egypt. Algeria though it is not as famous among young African people but it is pretty much famous among older generations this is mainly due to her positive role in various wars for independence in Africa. Algeria financed and trained a lot of wars of independence in Africa. Nigeria is Africa\u2019s biggest economy and most populated African nation, Nigeria also dominates in Africa sports/entertainment industry. South Africa, it is Africa\u2019s most developed country, After the fall of Libya under Muammar Gadaffi. South Africa has retaken back the position of an African country that has invested heavily in Africa. Also, South Africa holds the largest number of African migrants from all over the continent. Most African people look at South Africa with a high pedigree Ethiopia due to the fact that it is only the country that successfully defeated the colonialists and escaped colonialism it has that respect in Africa. Also, Ethiopia holds a large part of the early civilization of Man is also one of the reasons. Last but not least The African Union was formed and has its headquarters in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. Tanzania, Tanzania is another country that has much respect in the continent. This is mainly due to her positive role in the independence struggle in Southern Africa nations the likes of Mozambique, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Angola, and the Comoros. Also, their first president Julius Nyerere is always praised for his success in creating a country with no tribal conflicts something which most leaders in Africa failed. Honorable mentions; Libya (Was the most respected country especially during Muammar Gadaffi last years of leadership, Ghana mainly due to her Pan Africanist ideologies of their first president Kwame Nkrumah, Zimbabwe during Mugabe reign who was regarded as Africa\u2019s strong man, Kenya deserves a mention though it has always had a controversial history in her allegiances in African affairs, Ivory Coast also has her respect in the continent.
