            "answer_text": "I will approach the topic from strictly military viewpoint and will skip over the general criminal nature of Serb military conduct in the war. So keep that in mind. Serbs entered the war with 3 crucial advantages, total control of JNA weaponry, surprise and naivete of Bosniak leadership. To exemplify these points: Bosniak leadership allowed extraction of all weaponry from JNA depots and stockpiles in their teritory. They allowed Serbs to conduct military exercises which conducted of digging trenches and setting up artillery around major urban centers, and they ignored attacks on civilians in both Croatia and Eastern Bosnia. With the inherited stockpile the Serbs were able to conduct large scale mechanized offensives, infantry assaults supported by artillery and ethnic cleansing of numerous towns like Prijedor, Visegrad, Sanski Most, Foca, Bijeljina, Bileca, Nevesinje and many others, all in the 1st year of the war. Their decision to exterminate civilians or rape them, in case they were captive women strenghtened the resolve of their enemies to fight to the bitter end. There is no surrender or retreat possible when the fate of those who surrender is well known and documented. In the second year came the Bosniak Croat war, the change of leadership in the Bosnian army, which would prove crucial for further conduct of the war. Rasim Delic became Chief of Staff and changed the tactics of the Bosnian army from strictly defensive to atritional warfare consisting of constant, small scale assaults along the entire front in order to utilize the only advantage they had over their enemies, which is manpower, and the only dissadvantage Serbs suffered. The constant attacks forced Serbs to disband heavy formations, such as mechanized or armored divisions and to spread them out across the entire front, which cut down on their ability to effectively attack. The war turned into WW1 style meatgrinder with modern weapons. During this time Serbs were able of organizing only single large scale operation, that of ethnic cleansing of Bosniak enclaves in Drina. Their second large operation, the attempted capture of Tuzla was such a disaster that Serbs lost the strategic initiative from that point to the end of the war. And that was during the time when Bosniaks and Croats were fighting as well. In 1994, widely seen as turning point of the war Serbs were forced to try to force Bosniaks to negotiation table trough deffensive action and inflicting heavy losses, which they failed to do. Considering the disadvantages and huge discrepancy in weaponry, 1.1 Bosniak soldiers dying for 1 Serb soldier was horrific loss strategically. ",

            "answer_text": "People don\u2019t get the chance to understand the nature of that war that was in Bosnia and Herzegovina during 1992\u20131995 period. It was not some kind of war where you have clear frontline and visible enemy.It was civil war with mostly religious differences at its base. Lines of that frontline were going through neighbourhoods, apartment buildings and even bedrooms. It had 4 direct participants with changing alliances:Herceg-Bosna by CroatiansRepublika Srpska Bosna i Hercegovina (later Republika Srpska) by SerbsRepulika Bosna i Hercegovina by Sarajevo Muslims (Muslim as nationality)AP Zapadna Bosna (West Bosnia) by other Muslim faction Indirect participants were Croatia, Serbia, Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, USA, UK, France, Germany and many other countries with different influence. Serbs had around 1.3 million in population, Muslims around 2.5 million and Croats around 500.000. The war that was fought was mostly guerilla warfare where the line of contact was.Serbs had, from the start of war, laid blockade to Sarajevo. That meant that around 10.000 soldiers of Republika Srpska tied around 50.000 soldiers of Republic of Bosnia.That is something that was felt in entire war, since Sarajevo didn\u2019t have the capacity to commit what Naser Oric had done to Serbs in surroundings of Srebrenica on massive scale in other places. Bosnia and Herzegovina was made as central state of Yugoslavia, where most of military industry was located, because of its terrain perfectly suitable for guerilla war. Yugoslavia 2.0 was made with WW2 experiences, so they were betting to fight foreign invaders from there. The West did a perfect job with instigating civil war there, from cost-benefit analysis point of view. As for the Army of Republika Srpska, they controlled around 75% of entire Bosnia and Herzegovina, before NATO decided to intervene.So in essence they did use the momentum of their success in tactical draws that they turned into strategic victory.
