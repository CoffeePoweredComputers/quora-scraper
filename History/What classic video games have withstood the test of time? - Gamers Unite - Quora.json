As I do not have a n64 I instead play it on my raspberry pi 4 with retro pie installed, and it is a great game even now. Pong  I don\u2019t know why but this is always one of my favorites. I love it\u2019s simplicity and I actually have a mobile port for it so I can play it in a hotel, camping, basically anywhere I go and for me it is a great time killer. ",

            "answer_text": "Pong.  I went to a retro exhibit at an art museum in Richmond and there on an old TV with controllers laid Pong. Pong is simple. It is table tennis between two white paddles on a black screen. It is competitive. It is fun. It is easy to pick up and put down.  Does that sound familiar? Pong inadvertently created the formula upon which all the most successful (not best but successful) video games still use to this day. I laughed when I first saw it at the exhibit. My buddy and I started playing and before we knew it, 30 minutes flew by. It is because of its simplicity that Pong will forever be the quintessential video game.  Pong - Wikipedia ",
