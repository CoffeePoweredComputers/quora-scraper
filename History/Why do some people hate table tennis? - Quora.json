            "answer_text": "Frankly, it\u2019s because people think it\u2019s really \u201ceasy\u201d and that anyone could play it well at an olympic level. To them I say. COME AT ME ON A FUCKING TABLE TENNIS TABLE AND I WILL POUND YOU INTO THE GROUND WITH A TABLE TENNIS BALL Now that we\u2019ve taken care of that, Table Tennis is actually just as hard as Tennis. It actually requires more explosive muscle power in the legs and arms than tennis does. In other words, table tennis players are very muscular (not bragging or anything :p ) Aside from that, table tennis also requires extreme amounts of control, hand eye coordination and precision, and timing. The ball can be hit as fast as 150 km/h and sometimes even faster, this is a ball that\u2019s barely 4 centimeters wide and is hard as fck to hit, especially when the other player is dropping it from corner to corner and you can\u2019t just lob one over. The spins on the ball are so important.  You read the ball wrong, and someone serves a flat serve with barely any top spin and you end up reading it as backspin and chopping it? RIP They\u2019ll smash your ass so hard you won\u2019t even see it coming. (because physics dictates that the ball will go back very high which gives them ample opportunity to hit a hard smash) What else were you thinking that sentence meant??? ;) Anyways, aside from that, table tennis players have to train like crazy to reach even just a national level I\u2019ve played about 7000 hours of table tennis in my \u201cCareer\u201d and that\u2019s nothing compared to what international players play. The rackets are also sexy and look much better than standard tennis rackets.  This racket is my go to - it costs 150 dollars alone and it\u2019s on a relatively low end of the scale. This is just the carbon fibre/wood composite blade mind you But still, it looks fucking dope and I have multiple of these - if you\u2019re superficial, the fact that people spend up to 700 dollars on a table tennis racket should mean that the sport is pretty serious. Name a Tennis player that pays 700 dollars for 100 grams of racket? Exactly, there are none Anyways, this was a bit of a tangent, but maybe you\u2019ll get why I tend to kick anyone who scoffs and laughs at table tennis right in the face ",

            "answer_text": "Though it may not apply depending on where you live, let me point out two reasons (Which at the very least, applies to where I live) Firstly, there are very, very few shops that sell quality bats. (Though I believe in the this phrase \u201cThe worker blames the tool\u201d, do continue to read) As a result, people who play using bats that are of lousier quality even with dedication to it, may find it very hard to play the game altogether. Secondly, people often think that table tennis is a very easy sport to play. Thus, (though I\u2019m not discouraging people from self-learning) people with zero experience try to learn from the internet on how to play when table tennis is a game which needs some form of supervision (E.g. An experienced coach) so that whoever is supervising can correct that person who is learning. What\u2019s more, there are very few table tennis coaches at where I live which does not help the situation. Thus, some people give up on table tennis rather early when it is a relatively simple sport to pick up with appropriate coaching. (Though it is simple to pick up, it is hard to master) ",
