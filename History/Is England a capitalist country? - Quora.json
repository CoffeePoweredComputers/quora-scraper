            "answer_text": "05:00 Sighing, I turn off my state-issued alarm clock, and stumble out of my state-issued bed. After kissing my Stalin figurine a good morning, I gently open the bathroom door for a 5 minute shower. I would have longer, but the Government only gives us 20 minutes of water for the day. Whilst in the shower, it is compulsory to stand in salute, facing the mural of Our Supreme And Divine Leader Boris Johnson (May peace bless his soul). I sometimes struggle to keep my boner down whilst looking at this magnificently handsome man. 7:00 Time for breakfast. I tune into the standard radio, and select the (only) channel, \u2018State-Approved News\u2019. Today, it was something about Boris Johnson single handedly solving world hunger by donating 4 cows to Africa. 9:00 I rush out of the door, early for work. When I arrive, I change into my state-issued uniform and adopt the state-issued smile. There\u2019s some foreigners coming in from their filthy capitalist countries. They\u2019ll convert soon enough though. Whilst walking at the state-approved speed, I look up and see a massive statue of \u2018She Who Shall Not Be Named Theresa May\u2019 being pulled down. About time. 11:00 Lunchtime, and I tuck into my delicious sandwich, handmade by workers at the factory nearby. 19:00 Work is over. I climb onto my state-issued bicycle and set off at the state-approved speed. I pass a group of protesters being gunned down by the military. I sigh. Why can\u2019t people be reasonable? 21:00 I stand on my porch as the entire street sings the national anthem. When the whole thing is done, it\u2019s nearing 22:00. 22:00 I put on my state issued pyjamas and climb into bed. I was issued some official porn. I\u2019m bored of it. I applied for a wife today, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be accepted into the marriage programme. Ah well, always next year I suppose. 22:30 I sleep, setting my alarm clock for 05:00, the official wake up time. What a life I live, in the most privileged country on Earth. *sexy outro music* ",

            "answer_text": "Kind of. More-so than the US which has what is known as \u2018crony capitalism\u2019 or \u2018protectionist capitalism\u2019 which is a contradiction in terms as capitalists believe in a free market, so protecting large players like Google and AT&T is hardly pro-competition. Then again, England (and pretty much all EU nations and commonwealth countries) have a higher degree of both socialism and true capitalism than the US which is seen as a capitalist nation but is not. The simple fact is that true capitalist nations are as rare as true democratic nations. England has \u2018first past the post\u2019 election system like some other false-democracies in false-capitalism nations. Many companies in England, especially in the defense (attack) sector are awarded contracts on a plate, so they effectively rob from the tax payer and this too is crony-capitalism, or \u201ccorporate socialism\u201d where profits are privatized but losses are made public; like the tax bailouts of the criminal banks. Therefor, the best way to describe England would be a \u201cmildly-fascist, parasitic, crony-capitalist, Nation-state under the guise of a political union\u201d. Due to the the fact that exports are around 7% and it has almost no resources so is a net importer, it probably will have to remain as such\u2026.. or face collapse. ",
