            "answer_text": "Every person is good and bad of its own kind. Earlier Ashoka was cruel as per divyavadan because he killed his 99 brothers. But later on, On coming in the influence of Buddhism he adopted the policy of Dhamma and spread it all over the world. He was a great emperor and very much powerful. He was a very ambitious person. Like every king he too wanted to conquer the large part of India. But after watching the bloodshed of more than thousands people in the battle of kalinga his mind deviated and he adopted buddhism. One saying in hindi \u201c agar subh ka bhula sham ko ghar aa jae to use bhula nai kahte\u201d. It means he realised that blood shading (violence) is not good and he started preaching the concept of non-violence. ",
