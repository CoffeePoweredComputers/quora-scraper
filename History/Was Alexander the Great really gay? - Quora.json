            "answer_text": "There is just one piece of genuine evidence with a bearing on Alexander\u2019s sexuality. Shortly after his death, one of his three wives gave birth to his son. There was never any doubt as to the boy\u2019s parentage, and it would have been to many persons\u2019 advantage to question this if there had been any opportunity \u2014 presumably the boy took after his father, so the question just never arose. It stands to reason, therefore, that on at least one occasion Alexander had vaginal sex with the boy\u2019s mother (to whom he happened to be married at the time). There our evidence ends. It is up to you to decide if this is enough evidence from which to draw any conclusions about Alexander\u2019s sexuality. All the rest is rumour, hearsay, innuendo, speculation. The rumours began in antiquity, of course; and speculation ran rampant. Here\u2019s an example: In order to make himself acceptable as a ruler to the Persians whom he had conquered, Alexander had to look and to act as a genuine Persian King. This included dressing up like a Persian King and maintaining a proper Persian court with all the proper court ceremonies. Now one of the things which any Near Eastern King worth his salt absolutely had to have was a harem. No harem = not a real king. And the Persian kings had had exceptionally large harems; as a matter of fact, Alexander\u2019s predecessor on the throne, Darius III, had had a harem with 365 concubines in it, i.e. one for each day of the year. Alexander too, if people were supposed to deem him a real king \u2014 and it was very much to his advantage that people should deem him a real king \u2014, needed a harem. So he too assembled a harem with 365 concubines. Now that has the makings of a good story. Here\u2019s what Diodorus of Sicily (first century B.C., but just a \u201creader\u2019s digest\u201d version of Cleitarchus, an historian of the mid-third century B.C. \u2014 and Cleitarchus loved the racy bits) had to say: \u201cBesides these things he [i.e. Alexander] added concubines just like Darius, being in number not fewer than the days of the year, but distinguished as to their beauty since they were selected out of all the women in Asia. Each night they walked around the King\u2019s bed so that he might make his choice of the one who would lie with him.\u201d (DS XVII 77,6\u20137) Note the salacious detail. Speculation about the extravagant sex lives of the rich and famous has always been in fashion, and with Alexander, who for political purposes maintained a harem of 365 concubines, the gates were thrown wide open. So here is what Curtius Rufus (he wrote about the mid-first century A.D. and based himself largely, but not exclusively on Cleitarchus \u2014 Curtius used other sources as well and now and again let his own imagination run wild) had to say about Alexander\u2019s harem: \u201c365 concubines, as many as Darius had had, filled the palace, and there followed after them flocks of eunuchs, who were particularly accustomed to playing the woman\u2019s part.\u201d (QC, VI 6, 8). It was all very shocking, and Curtius Rufus was never so happy as when he had something to be shocked about. And whenever he didn\u2019t have quite enough to be shocked about, he often invented something of a sufficiently shocking nature. Curtius had in front of him the same text of Cleitarchus as Diodorus had had, and at least in Diodorus\u2019 pr\u00e9cis of Cleitarchus, there was nothing about eunuchs who played the woman\u2019s part. Curtius Rufus quite possibly contributed that all on his own, so he could have something really shocking to present to his readers (who presumably enjoyed being shocked just as much as he did). And so Alexander\u2019s sex life got even wilder. And there you have some of the ancient world\u2019s rumour and innuendo and speculation about Alexander\u2019s sex life. How trustworthy is any of it? That\u2019s up to you to decide for yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but not in the way you think. The modern understanding of sexuality as divided into the categories of homosexuality, bisexuality and heterosexuality did not exist in ancient Greece. Alexander and the ancient Greeks had a fundamentally different view of sex, lust and love. They didn\u2019t define themselves as either a homosexual or a heterosexual. You were just attracted to the gender you were attracted to. But that doesn\u2019t mean they were completely liberal about sexuality. There were some amount of controversy and social stigma on the topic. As an example, it would be incredibly shameful for a free male citizen to take the \u201creceiving\u201d (what the Greeks would probably call the \u201cpassive) role in homosexual sex, because that would be emasculating. Taking the passive role in sex was usually accepted or even encouraged if you were: A women (sex with women was viewed as something less pleasurable, and mainly for the purposes of starting a family, as opposed to sex with boys)A boy or teenager. (Yes, the Greeks practiced pederasty. Having a homosexual relationship with an older male during your youth was viewed as a good thing for your development)A slave or prostitute (The Romans and Greeks both had many professionals outside the restrictions of their morals, to take the passive role)This type of relationship is even enshrined in one of the most well-known legends of the Archaic Age, which all ancient Greeks would have known; the Illiad, where young Patroclus was the lover of Achilles, a relationship Alexander attempted to emulate with his lover Hephaestion. Edit: As Evangelos Lolos has pointed out in the comments, it has never been stated directly that Hephaestion and Alexander were sexually intimate, even though there was no social stigma or a reason to hide it. Similarly, the sexual nature of the relationship between Patroclus and Achilles may very well be a projection of later authors, such as the Athenians, as no intimacy is described in the Illiad. And of course, it should be noted that all pederastic relationships were not sexual, and the option for a platonic relationship could have been dominant for all we know ",
