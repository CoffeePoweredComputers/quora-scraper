            "answer_text": "A bad question on numerous levels. Sameness Using such a word implies Armenians alive today are the very same people as \u201cancient times.\u201d Needless to say Armenians have not discovered the Fountain of Youth and individuals alive in the world today as \u201cArmenians\u201d are not the very same people existing a millennium or more ago. Clearly though the question didn\u2019t mean such a concept, even if the word \u201csame\u201d was used. So what then was meant? Culture Armenian culture, though connected with that of its ancients, is not the same either. Furthermore, this requires looking at each aspect of \u201cculture.\u201d Language - Modern Armenian is directly related to Classical Armenian. It does, however, have many differences that reflect generations of linguistic drift, foreign influence and modernization.Lifestyle - Armenians overall do not live like their ancient counterparts at all. They live rather like their contemporary counterparts from other identities. Certain rituals and practices survive, but even those have been codified in versions that were not necessarily in line with the ancients.Music, food and dress - Most of these took form in the last few centuries and not before. Some instruments and food types do have ancient origins, but they were fully codified in their current forms in the last few centuries as well. As far as dress, of course Armenians do not dress like their ancient ancestors, though they might break out what they believe to be those ancient clothes during certain festivals and events.Genes This is what I describe as a meaningless and misunderstood pursuit. To say that Armenians today \u201chave the same genes as their ancestors\u201d is to say almost nothing about them. This type of predetermined \u201cnatural state\u201d of Armenians borders on the pseudoscience and racism that infected much of the sciences in prior centuries. Furthermore, what genetic tests that we conduct today tell us about a group of people are absolutely misunderstood and misused. These misusers ascribe universality to certain haploid groups simply for being the most common (even if that is a rather low percentage) , totally ignoring how little that tells us about the history of a group of people (including the fact that it only describes lineage along one sex and does so of only one particular individual) . Conclusion So then what can we say with certainty about the connections between modern and ancient Armenians? We simply say that they are nothing more than a continuum of one particular identity \u2014 always in flux, always evolving and yet maintaining a connection through identification of a name, a place, a practice or a language. The only \u201csame\u201d between them exists with our perceptions of \u201csameness\u201d and not with some unchanging entity. ",

            "answer_text": "Genetically speaking, more or less. At least, if we draw the line at the Neolithic Age, as according to the article below, Armenian males have Y-DNA dating back to the Neolithic Age, with distinct genes found only in the Ararat, Van, Gardman Region among Near East populations. Neolithic patrilineal signals indicate that the Armenian plateau was repopulated by agriculturalists Especially if we draw the line at the Bronze Age, which is when the last significant intermixing the Armenian gene pool had. Genetic evidence for an origin of the Armenians from Bronze Age mixing of multiple populations ",
