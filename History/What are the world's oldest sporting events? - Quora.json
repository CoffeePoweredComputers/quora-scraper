            "answer_text": "Hard to say. Shrovetide football goes back to the twelfth century - but it is hard to prove any particular game is the oldest or determine continuity much earlier than 1700. Falklands Palace is the oldest extant tennis court - before the 16th C it was mainly a street game. Although Clerge is acknowledged as the first World Champion, the first actual challenge we have evidence for was in 1816 - Marchisio\tdefeated Philip Cox at the James St court in London, unfortunately no longer extant. Newmarket Races was established as a formal course in 1630 - the Town Plate first contested in 1666 and still being run and is the oldest race run to an official set of rules, rather than to ad hoc ones made up locally.

            "answer_text": "FA Cup in soccer 1871/2. Calcutta Cup, 1878, in rugby are amongst the oldest. Most international competition was started in late 19th or early 20th century so the oldest still running cycle event was started in 1892, that is the Liege-Bastogne-Liege race. I almost forgot as it is a very niche event is The Doggets Coat and Badge, an annual sculling (rowing event) for lightermen, who are people who work on The Thames. That dates back to 1715 There may well be other and older events but those are my offerings. ",
