            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll try to translate a Greek joke in English as best as I can and you can draw your own conclusions. When God created the world he told all the people to come to his office from 8 o\u2019clock in the morning till 5 o\u2019clock in the afternoon to allocate them their lands. Right on time at 8 o\u2019clock sharp the English was first online followed by the German and etc and etc. By 5 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, everyone passed by God\u2019s office and got land. All except the Greek. At around 10 o\u2019clock there was a knock on God\u2019s door. He opens it and there in front of him, the greek was standing. the following conversation ensued. G Yes. Oh..its you. You are late. I gave all the lands. None is left. Gr. Hey Boss I know I am late but there must something you can give me. G. You should have come on time. Gr. But I woke up late. G. Why? Gr. You know\u2026I had a late night at the bouzouki and couldn\u2019t wake up in time. G. I don\u2019t care. Go away. Gr. Wait a minute Boss. Is not my fault. G. What do you mean is not your fault. Gr. No. Is no my fault. It's yours. G. Mine? Gr. Yes! Yours. You know me better than anyone else. You made me like this. After a lot of deliberation, God said. Ok. Look there is a piece of LAND on earth which I reserved for my self. Is not very big. Is very rocky and is surrounded on three sides by the sea. From ALL my children you are the shiftiest, the most irresponsible and the most undisciplined. But you are the kindest, the brightest and deep down you love most so I\u2019ll let have it. A Land reserved for GODS. What about this. Hope you like it and no offense to my brothers. ",
