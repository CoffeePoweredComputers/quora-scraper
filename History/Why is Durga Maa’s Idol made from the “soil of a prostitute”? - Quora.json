            "answer_text": "Durga idol requires many different soils for its creation. Soil from Ganga, courtyard of a king, soil from Shakti peetha, soil from an anthill, soil from the tusk of a boar, soil from a cremation ground along with soil from the yard of vesya i.e. a prostitute is required. Durga puja is a tantric festival that celebrates Shakti and tantra texts advice us to view every women as a manifestation of the goddess. Vidyah samasta devibhedah striyah samastah sakala jagatsu. Tvayekaya puritamambayetat kate stuti stavyaparaparokti. Every women must thus be honoured. There is also a belief that when a man visits a prostitute he leaves behind all his punya (good deeds) at her doorstep. The soil of the doorstep is thus called punya mati. Many families carry out Durga puja without a clay idol in such cases these soils are spread below the Devi ghat. ",
