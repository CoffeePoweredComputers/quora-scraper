            "answer_text": "Worst? Naw. Very underpowered for sure but all in all not a bad knock off of a german design MP18. The MP18 is a really great weapon, and was the main platform for many sub guns for decades. Had the Japanese used a standard 9x19 (9mm parabellum) it would have been in a whole other class and a contender for top 10 best. The4 8mm Nambu is what they used in pistols for the most part and it is a .32 cal but has the same power as a .380acp, which is not bad but only about 65% of a 9mm. World War II Japan is a great example of what not to do to win a war. They believed that the weapons used were not near as important as the humans driving them. And while a badass special forces trained elite warrior is a whole lot of whoop-ass, it just not as much as you need to go against 10,000 badass elite warriors. They really bought into the xenophobic notion that a single japaneses person was worth 20 of any other race or nation. The code of Bushido is awesome, but it does not makeup for shotty tools that simply do not match your opponents. However, some of what they produced in terms of weapons were by any standard world class top shelve; IMHO ",
