            "answer_text": "First let me begin by saying that I will very likely update this answer with much more information. I am getting to this right before I should be going to bed, as it is almost 3:30 am where I am :-) Ok, let\u2019s begin. In my humble opinion some of the best chess players of all time are: Aron Nimzovich - He wrote the grand book \u2018My System\u2019. This book has been called the pillar of what became to be known as the Hypermodern school of chess. Every great chess player has read this book at least once. If you want to see the concepts in \u2018My System\u2019 really shown clearly on the board take a look at the games from the first Kasparov v Deep Blue match in the 1990s. Kasparov vs Deep Blue  Joseph Henry Blackburne - His nickname was the Black Death. He played in what was called the romantic style of play. Here is one of my favorite games from him. Joseph Henry Blackburne - Wikipedia  Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca - This guy was master of the endgame and an all around brilliant player. He was a world champ so I guess he was pretty strong :-) Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca - Wikipedia Here is a really nice game that shows Capablanca\u2019s endgame skill. In this tournament Capablanca finished in first place even with Botvinnik playing.  Robert Fischer - Fischer was the main person to make chess popular in America because he not only won the world chess championship but because he did it at a time when the Soviets were seen as invincible. Fischer was deeply logical and an original thinker. Bobby Fischer - Wikipedia  Anatoly Karpov - Karpov makes my list because he was not only very strong player and also a world champion, but it has been said that his style was so slow and methodical that he would just squeeze you so slowing that you would either fall asleep and lose or just plain lose for no apparent reason. Here is a game from the later part of his career, but we can see that he was still very strong. Anatoly Karpov - Wikipedia  Paul Keres - He was never world champ but was one of the best players of all time. I have to admit that I love his namesake opening, the Keres Attack in the Sicilian. Paul Keres - Wikipedia  Mikhail Tal - Tal. For me, that name says it all. This guy was a magician at the chessboard. I have heard descriptions when the young Tal beat Botvinik to become world champion describing the encounter as a mugging! I really should just write an entire article on this guy. His style of play was called unsound by many people and too strongly built on intuition, but like the saying goes\u2026 It Worked! Tal was known for his aggressive and inventive style of attacking play. Mikhail Tal - Wikipedia  Mikhail Botvinnik - Not only was he a world champion but his style was so logical that it had a great beauty to it. I have heard him called the \u2018Iron Logician\u2019. Mikhail Botvinnik - Wikipedia Here is a nice video of a game where he played the arrogant young Bobby Fischer.  Garry Kasparov - In my opinion Kasparov is the greatest player ever. His style is very crowd pleasing because he was very strong in every phase of the game. His opening preparation was legendary. His style was very aggressive and he was seldom afraid to play double-edged and risky positions. Kasparov was also a gifted theoretician. He is often credited with putting the Modern Benoni out of business among other great accomplishments. He was also a great Benoni player!Garry Kasparov - Wikipedia  Judit Polg\u00e1r - If ever there was a woman that would make many men feel the sting of \u201cgetting beat by a girl!\u201d it was Judit Polgar. Her brave, aggressive and creative play easily puts her on this list of great players. She has the distinction of having been the strongest female player of all time, but I would say she was among the strongest players of all time. Judit also was at the time the youngest person to have become a GM. Judit Polg\u00e1r - Wikipedia Here is a nice video of Judit crushing Anand!  Sorry for showing so many videos from one YouTube content creator, but I really like this agodmator\u2019s channel a great deal because his commentary is very good and he always shows such great games. Looks like I have again stayed up way too late because of chess! Oh well. I hope you all enjoyed this answer and find it useful. ",

            "answer_text": "Picking among the top all time players is an exercise in splitting hairs. So I will list them chronologically. Paul Morphy: I\u2019ve heard him described as a Joe Louis (a great boxing champ) who strongest competition weighed 180 pounds. He was so far ahead of his time that he was never really tested. William Steinitz: Sometimes condemned as the man who \u201ctook the fun out of chess.\u201d Prior to Steinitz, in the romantic era of chess, people tended to attack at all costs. Steinitz brought a more scientific approach to the game including sound defensive techniques. He has also been referred to as the \u201cgreat lawgiver\u201d for his fundamental contributions to chess as a science. Emanual Lasker: A lone wolf whose view of chess as a fight doesn\u2019t fit in with the development of chess. Whereas Steinitz played the board completely ignoring who the opponent was, Lasker played the man he was facing. Jose Capablanca: The \u201cMozart of Chess.\u201d As Mozart was music\u2019s greatest natural genius, Capablanca was chess\u2019s greatest natural genius. There is an interesting parallel between the development of music and the development of chess. Just as Mozart was the supreme practioner of the classical era of music, Capablanca was the supreme practioner of the classical era of chess. Alexander Alekhine: Well known for his aggressive attacking play. A rival once said he was capable of producing a work of art from a position that would hardly inspire anybody else to send a picture postcard. (Morally he was something of a monster. Today he would probably be locked up. If you were to invite him to your house, you\u2019d better lock the door to your wife\u2019s bedroom.) Mikhail Botvinnik: A real chess thinker. He held the world championship three different times! After the rare occasions when someone would beat him, he always seemed to win the rematch. Bobby Fisher: Nobody has had quite the hold on the imagination as Bobby Fisher. His time at the top was brief but incredibly brilliant. He once said his greatest enjoyment was when he had his opponent in such a vice that there were helpless, something he called \u201cego-crushing\u201d. I.e. he liked hurting his opponents. (He probably had the most bizarre personality in the history of top players. In his later years, he was so out of touch with reality that he was in serious need of therapy.) Anatoly Karpov: Became champ by default when Fisher didn\u2019t defend his title (Fisher gave a list of \u201cunnegotiable\u201d demands that he probably assumed would be unsatisfactory.) Then Karpov entered in more top tournaments than anyone in history achieving unprecendented results becoming one of the all time greats. His positional style has been likened to a boa constrictor, that is he severely restricted his opponents play and then would slowly crush them like a boa constrictor eating its lunch. Gary Kasparov: The Russian star who overtook the elder Russian Karpov. He had a more tactical style than Karpov which was easier to understand and which made him more popular among the chess playing public. He had so many battles with Karpov that he once deemed him \u201cmy permanent opponent.\u201d Watching two of all time greats battle it out was a real joy similar to watching the battles between golf greats Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus. Current players who have a reasonable shot of making this list: Magnus Carlson and Fabiano Caruana. Yes, the two players in the recently finished world championship match. They are both great players but it is still too early in their careers to judge where their entire career will fit. I could easily imagine either or both of them making the all time list but you just don\u2019t know what will happen in the future. That\u2019s why they play the games, you do not know what is going to happen. ",
