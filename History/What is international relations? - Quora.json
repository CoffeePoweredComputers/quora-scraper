            "answer_text": "International relations is an academic discipline that focuses on the study of the interaction of the actors in international politics, including states and non-state actors, such as the United Nations (UN), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and Amnesty International. One of the key features of the international system is that it's a state of anarchy - each state in the system is sovereign and does not have to answer to a higher authority. Imagine living in a confined space with a group of other people with limited resources. Further imagine that there is no law enforcement and that the only 'law' is agreements between individuals and self-help is the only means of enforcement. In short, every person can do whatever he or she wants only subject to what the others in the space will do as a result. This situation gives you an idea of the world in which states live. International relations involves the study of such things as foreign policy, international conflict and negotiation, war, nuclear proliferation, terrorism, international trade and economics, and international development, among other subjects. As you may expect, international relations' broad scope requires an interdisciplinary approach, drawing upon the fields of economics, law, political science, sociology, game theory, and even psychology.

            "answer_text": "What is international relations? The late great British economic historian, Professor Gerard Curzon, doctoral graduate of the London School of Economics and longtime Professor of International Economics at the Institut Universitaire de Hautes Etudes Internationales, The Graduate Institute of International Studies, The University of Geneva, Switzerland, once described such while pacing around the periphery of the many desks forming his International Economics classroom which I sat in during the late 1980s. There, within the Villa Barton which long housed the Institute, gazing outside of its windows gracing all the natural beauty beholden on majestic Lake Geneva, he pointedly answered the question by observing the governing academic philosophy of the Graduate Institute of International Studies at The University of Geneva, Switzerland, today now known as the Graduate Institute of International And Development Studies, as the following. \u201cFrankly, he said, we don\u2019t know exactly what it (International Relations] is, but this, is what we do know.\u201d That if, \u201cwhile here\u201d he said paraphrasing, \u201cone acquires a good working knowledge of the three disciplines of International Economics, International Law, and International History and Politics, you will come away with a good understanding of what it is that we mean, when we say that we study International Relations.\u201d It was then, and seems to me to still hold, as a good bellwether for framing a good foundation for one\u2019s studies in the field we call such, and for acquiring a better appreciation, definitionally speaking. And over these many preceding decades to the present, students (with professors alike) emanating from 70 plus countries throughout the world, studying and successfully completing coursework and comprehensive examinations in each of these three fields, as prerequisite to earning the PhD, period. Moreover, they these many students do this along with researching, writing, and defending a dissertation with a view to qualifying for the Institute\u2019s PhD in International Relations degree with specialization in any one of these three respective disciplines. I hope this helps, and if I can be of any assistance in answering any related questions you might have, please feel free in contacting me at: drdon7228@yahoo and if I can, I certainly will be happy to try and help you.
