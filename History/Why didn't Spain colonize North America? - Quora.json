            "answer_text": "The answer is: We did indeed colonize North America. We just lost it later, but that\u2019s an entirely different matter. First of all, Mexico is, geographically speaking, part of North America, way above what is considered central America. Second, do the names San Francisco, Los \u00c1ngeles, Florida or El Paso ring some kind of bells to you? They are Spanish names because these territories were indeed, part of the Spanish Empire, and many of these cities were founded by Spanish colonists and conquistadores. At its peak, the Spanish empire controlled the two Californias (alta y baja California), New Mexico, Oregon, Arizona, Texas (it was called \u201cTejas\u201d back then) and Florida, in addition to Mexico and the entire South American continent (albeit as some fellow Quoran pointed out, Brazil was only part of the Spanish empire during a brief dynastic union). As to why the Spanish empire didn\u2019t go further north, there are many different reasons why. First of all, back in the XVth centry, when Columbus landed, the wealthiest American regions were located in Mexico and Peru, which had extensive, populous, complex native american civilizations, plus tons of gold and silver mines. North America, in contrast, didn\u2019t offer much in terms of resources nor manpower. It was a poor and sparsely populated region, so its conquest just wasn\u2019t a profitable endeavour. Considering how the empire was already overstretched, the Spanish were content with just establishing a defensive network of forts or \u201cpresidios\u201d against Comanche raids:  This situation was reminiscent of the whole China VS Steppe peoples situation. You had a nomadic enemy which, albeit aggressive and numerically inferior, was simply not conquer-able. So this status-quo maintained for centuries. That being said, the situation changed in the XVIIIth century. With the arrival of European competitors to the American continent, the Spanish empire saw the need to expand beyond its American frontiers of yore so these unclaimed territories would not be occuppied by France nor Britain instead. So by the time that the Utretch treaty was signed, these were the new Spanish frontiers, now vastly expanded northwards:  Needless to say, all these northern territories were eventually lost once Mexico got its independence on the year 1821. The Spanish empire was already overstretched, and the young American nation was better positioned to exert control and influence these frontiers which were, after all, much closer to its backyard. However, in one unexpected twist of history, in the end neither Spain nor Mexico ended up controlling these territories in North America. It wasn\u2019t its old foe either, the much dreaded British Empire. An unexpected rival, the United States, entered into the fray. Previously a nation focused in the Atlantic trade, with the advent of technological advances such as the railways and the rifle, plus the Louisiana purchase, the US expansion towards the west territories was a much more viable endeavour than in the past, and the rest, as they say, is history. Author\u2019s note: Answer was edited to make clear that the Spanish territories were lost to the Mexican independentists, not the United States (previous answer\u2019s version wasn\u2019t clear enough).

            "answer_text": "Spain was the first Empire to colonize North America, but they lost control over it because they settled it for short-term gains, not for long-term growth. The main incentive behind colonizing North America was for gold and passage. The earliest explorers of North America were Spanish Conquistadors, going through the Mississippi River, Mexico, and modern-day Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.  Spanish artifacts found in Texas from the 17\u201318th century. Under order of the Pope, the Spanish Empire was allowed to colonize North America, however they needed to convert the Native population to Christianity as well. In order to do this, the Empire built several fortified Missions all over New Spain. These were few and far between settlements that were expensive and difficult to maintain from a long distance.  Misi\u00f3n San Antonio de Valero, commonly known as The Alamo, the most famous of these Spanish missions, was built in 1718.  Different missions in modern-day Texas. It\u2019s important to note that unlike England, which gave the 13 Colonies independent rule, New Spain still had a centralized, direct report to the King himself. This slowed down enforcement and re-supply greatly, as a grievance to the Monarch could take two months to get to Spain, then another two months at best to receive a response. This gave rise to corruption and other problems such as a lack of sufficient military personnel that led to the Missions falling into disrepair over time. Now, the Spanish Empire made several mistakes when it came to colonization. First of all, they spent too much time looking for gold. The amount of gold they returned to Europe from the New World actually crashed its value, which didn\u2019t help Spain\u2019s debt. Secondly, they failed to see the long-term gains from farming and developing the land. The benefits from farming sugarcane, corn, or wheat, while they would take time, would have overall resulted in greater profit for Spain. Spain\u2019s foolish quests for gold cities were in vain, when the real \u201cgold\u201d was the fertile soil they walked over. Thirdly, Spain did not have a sustainable plan for its colonists. They wanted complete control over their colonists, instead of self-rule, and they did little to create suitable living environments for their settlers. To be sent to America was a punishment for a long time. By 1821, Mexico was recognized as an independent country by Spain, and Spanish Florida was seized by the United States. Spain\u2019s colonization of North America lasted for 300 years, but failed due to a failure to grow proper roots.  Written in 20 minutes while listening to Gold on the Ceiling by The Black Keys. ",
