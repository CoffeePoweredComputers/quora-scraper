            "answer_text": "Not sure. Where I live, here in Marseille, there is a guillotine in the MuCEM (Museum of the Civilisations of Europe and the Mediterranean). Annoyingly, it is covered by some sort of semi-transparent veil. I consider that when I go to a museum it is to look at historic artifacts, not artistic interpretations of them. Ah well! Anyway it is possibly an old one from 1793 and may have been used for the last execution in 1977 too, although as I said, it is frustratingly badly presented and with no information pertaining to it - in a museum! I had to look up information about it on the internet. Maybe I should talk to one of the curators about it one day. Anyway there is a complete, actual guillotine in a museum in Marseille. Come and get a glimpse of it through its dark artistic veil if you wish. Maybe it beheaded our king. For information, guillotines were not common even in their heyday. They used to be dismantled and moved to where they were needed. My grandfather remembers a public execution when he was a boy, as his home was just opposite the prison. Although the gendarmes made him go the long way round, because they were \u201cpublic\u201d but without the public, as they blocked the streets, in order to follow the letter of the law without having the problem of people watching the spectacle. That would have been around the mid 1930s. ",

            "answer_text": "Where the actual wooden structure is, I do not know. The blade that is thought to have guillotined Marie Antoinette is on display at Madame Tussaud\u2019s in London. It is most likely that this blade was used to kill Louis XVI as well, and many other nobles and counter-revolutionaries. No one knows for sure if the same blade was used, though I would imagine that it likely was. Both Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were executed at the Place de la R\u00e9volution (now called Place de la Concorde); the same structure was most likely used. ",
