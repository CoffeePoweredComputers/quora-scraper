            "answer_text": "I think it has been mentioned many times that an island is a body of land that is surrounded by water. An archipelago on the other hand is a group of islands. These group of islands maybe forming a sovereign state or it maybe a part of a sovereign states. The Malay Archipelago, for example, is an archipelago that is made up of three countries, Malaysia, Philippines, and Indonesia. This is the largest archieplago in the world. This archipelago is composed of smaller archipelago, i.e. Phiilippine group of Islands and Indoensian group of islands. The Philippines itself is composed of 2 large islands (Luzon and Mindanao) and two main lesser archipelago (the Visayan Archipelago and the Sulu Archipelago). But I would like to highlight that being an archipelago doesn\u2019t automatically make the country and archipelagic country. Greece, for example is an archipelago but not an archipelagic country. The British Isles is also an archipelago but not an archipelagic country. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone knows that an archipelago is quite different from an island. Though \u201carchipelago\u201d and \u201cisland\u201d are very much related and one cannot be separated from the other, they are quite different terms. An island is a land that is surrounded on all the sides by water. Archipelago is the name given to the groups of islands. Caribbean archipelago and Hawaiian archipelago are two best examples of an archipelago. Tobago and Trinidad are the southernmost islands of the Caribbean archipelago. This example clearly defines what an archipelago and an island is ",
