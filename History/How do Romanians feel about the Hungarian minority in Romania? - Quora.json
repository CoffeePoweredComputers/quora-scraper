            "answer_text": "The relations at the level of the population have always been basically good, of tollerance and interactive help. It is a fact that Hungarians benefit of exceptional rights, which neither they nore other minorities in the neighbouring region have. Starting with the aftermath of WW1 there have been huge recompensation of the Romanian state both for real estate of institutions of the Hungarian state, as even to Hungarian landlord who owned more land that was allowed by romanian law. There is a full education program from primary school to university, there are media in Hungarian, and many more. However one thing could never be recompensated: The pleasant feeling of being overlords. And equal rights is just not enough. Especially after 1990 and even more under Orban, who is a national populist \u2014 that I appreciate very much for other attitudes of his \u2014 a politics of seggregation has been strongly ignited from abroad (Budapest and diaspora), with the effect that one sees less and less mixed schools, less Romanians speaking Hungarian (it was natural for many to learn the language of the minority), and even Hungarian youngster entering maturity with very poor knowledge of the language of the majority. In terms of rights there is a quite hard to accept tendency of \u201cnever enough\u201d, which is spread by the same political engine. Detail rights found in totally estraneous contexts in unique conditions, are declared as a must be, and in lack of that the condition of the Hungarian minority still winned through the world as a bad one. The comparison is never with some poor country of the neighbourhood, of course. Hungarian friends tell me that what to Romanians looks like an increasing thread of provocations, which challenge their patience, is a calculated policy of fishing votes on behalf of Fidesz. One should mention things like the president Nemeth\u2019s statement that \u201cI assure you that in about 8 years it will be possible to speak again also about redrawing the border map in Europe\u201d \u2014 that was in 2010. Imagine this as one point in a continuum of nationalistic provocations, which would take too long to enumerate, and you will get the picture of an increasingly difficult relation. On the other hand, the people have a certain wisdom \u2014 not too large, but yet, appreciable by comparison. With all this long chain of provocations \u2014 to which Romanians respond sporadically and explosively, in an uncoordinated way, which delights the Hungarians, since they do not understand they went too far, but rather gather a new object of difamation and negative propaganda (I will give one example below) \u2014 one may thank to God that there has been no violent escalation. In March 1990 there has been a weel coordinated attempt to raise hell, which strangely was known in advance in Budapest \u2014 they prepared an Irish journalist telling him when, where and what to film \u2014 and it is well known that agents of unidentified provenience had been spreading the news both among Romanian and among Hungarian villagers (of course by people of the same ethny, speaking well the language) that \u201cthe others\u201d are beating their children that go to school in town. Theer \u201cmiraculously\u201d were everywhere trucks and busses to immediately bring them to town, where they beat upon one an other in a sadly violent confrontation. Which could however be stopped before spreading in time and space, so Balkan condition could not be SEEDED! Briefly \u2014 the popular relations are still mostly friendly, but there is a seeded tension which does not serve other than political purposes of few. One must add that there are two \u201cethnic parties\u201d (quite a unicum for Hungarians of Romania), which have all the votes of the Hungarian ellectorate and play the role that in Israel the religious party do: they are in EVERY government, no matter the orientation. Finally, let me expose in detail a recent anecdote that well reflects the character of the situation. You have to know in advance that Hitler and Mussolini divided in 1941 Transylvania, giving half of the territory to Horthy. The occupation was accompanied massacres in Ip, Viseu, Dosu, Cireasa and probably many other places, lists of Romanians who had been active 23 years ago for the Union being used for extensive revenge. Then, work camps were built for Romanians and Jews \u2014 this was under Horthy, long before Szalaszy then organized deportation of the \u201cHungarian\u201d Jews to German camps. Briefly, for Romanians Horthy was as fascist as it goes \u2014 to Jews he was unfortunately only the prelude of the dramatic deportations of 1944. Thus, in spring 2018, the museum of history of a small town in Romania with high Hugarian population, decides to make a commemorative exhibit about the entrance of Horthy in Transylvania. A historical even, you know. The exhibit is accepted with some reticence by the county leader. One would expect, given the circumstances described above, that the exhibit had some educative character, like so often in Germany under the idea of \u201cnever again\u201d. Not small was the surprize when a second request was introduced, requiring to accept to inauguration of the exhibit with the raising of the K & K flat of Hungary in the court of the exhibition, and with an event of several hours, including singing of fascist songs of the time, etc. Briefly, far from being an educative event, it was a nostalgically commemorative event. The fact produced a scandal that reached the government in Bucharest and the premier shouted in fury \u201cCei care vor sa fluture steaguri straine in muzee, ii voi flutura eu \u2026 \u201c. Litterally \u201cThose who wish to let foreign flags flutter in Romanian muzeums, shall be fluttered by me \u2026 \u201c. This was an angry reaction against the organizors who obviously went too far, and it was a rather funny menace at their address. The reaction of the united hungarian community was an example of bad faith and organized calomnia. The very next day, the Kossuth House in Washington and probably other news services had spread in the world the criptic news that \u201cRomanian premier manaces to hang all Hungarian in the country\u201d. Without context, without source text, but with long and calomniative context. Actually, it was an American Quoran who believed the fake news, and let me to investigate in the story at that time. In Hungarian (like in English), a banner is \u201changed\u201d, there is no other word for the action of letting a banner ondulate in the wind. In Romanian, there is \u2014 and so the first deception consisted in using this discrepancy. But the main deception was obviously to extrapolate maliciously an angry menace against the organizors of an exhibit \u2014 who, the reader will have understood by now, had done a lot for producing anger \u2014 to a whole population. Thus from 10 to one million. I must say, I tried to talk in those days to educated and intelligent \u2014 but quite extremist \u2014 hungarians that I know. They shouted to the face \u201cHe menaces to kill one million\u201d. I am patient and confronted them with the facts and original text, they know romanian and thus know that the allegiance is absurd calomnia. But they would not recognize, even in a private discussion. Certainly events of this quality of manipulation \u2014 and they are abundent \u2014 are a big challenge to reciprocal relations and Romanians feel overwhelmed and helpless against such world wide calomnia, which makes them less disponible to understanding. Sad but true. ",

            "answer_text": "It is sad to see that answers from Romania are still absolutely one-sided. Quora is supposed to be beyond and over petit-nationalist, childish quarrels, typical of the nations in this corner of the world. The question, naturally, should better be answered by Romanians, after all it is about their feelings. However, Hungarians may also contribute as they are the targets of these feelings. Let us try to be factual. Minority rights recently and in sharp contrast to 1920\u20131940 and from around 1965 to 1990 are rather extensive in Romania. More on paper, but also in reality and contrast favourably with many countries in the region. (One of the most grotesque comments are when Romanians themselves conclude how good they have always been and are and pat one another on the shoulder\u2026) True, simple Romanians folks in Transylvania were not treated well by the Hungarian authorities up to 1918. (They were treated even worse in Romania then, as the Peasant Uprising of 1907 amply demonstrates. This, however, is missing from the nationalist narrative. ) However, it is rather typical that Romanians view minorities - living there for 700 or 1000 years - as kind of intruders to ancient and sacred Romanian lands with no inherent rights, just generously tolerated by the benign Romanian nation state. Also, the very complex past of the region, in many ways - historic architecture of major cities, for example - still dominated by these minorities is interpreted as monochrome, everything explained as Romanian. This goes hand in hand with the lack of understanding that minorities have a different history, what could be liberation for the majority was a tragedy for them. They try and manage to come to a kind of peaceful co-existence but this is all, to expect their mythical loyalty to the \u201cRomanian state bringing for them Paradise\u201d is just not realistic. This is still very immature and should catch up with how these conflicts are managed further West. Then the autonomy issue may also be seen in another light, the acid test being which is better for both sides and not just simply nationalistic jealousy dominating the debate. ",

Other than this there are people that find them arrogant and nationalistic, sometime extremists. This is usually fueled by politicians around elections to win votes. From a social point of view: They always grouped around an ethnic political party, which only fuels autonomy and hate based on ethnicity. This is the longest party in power in Romania, always willing to make \u2018deals\u2019 with any party just to have a share of the power. It is literally called the bitch of romanian politics, as everyone can have it if they are offered a share of the big cake. They never did anything to improve their community economy and wealth. The counties where they gain majority are amongst the poorest economical regions in the country, despite the fact that Romania shares its resources across all regions from a single pool, taking from richest zones and beefing up the poorer ones. Instead of investing and trying to integrate in the country they are part of, this party only instigate to separatism and their only objective is ethnic autonomy. Most central resources are wasted on this objective. As a result many ethnic hungarians don\u2019t want to learn the language of the county they live in, just because the party says that this is patriotic. This only isolates them even more, making it very hard for them to find a job (a good paid one), outside the small areas where they represent a majority. ",

            "answer_text": "I think there is not too much difference than how any other country feel about a relatively important minority. The Szekelyes and Magyars are about 5% of total Romanian population with a concentration in the middle of the country in an area not so populated. The Szekelyes practiced a closed politics, refusing companies that would want to build production plant there, \u201cafraid\u201d that Romanians would also come there, and their majority, considering their small number, would be easily overbalanced by the Romanian peoples settling there. So they remained pretty much underdeveloped and poor. On the other side, the Magyars living in the rest of the country are mostly well integrated, they are usually 2\u20135% in most of the towns, in other they are 10\u201325%, and in a very few rather rural localities are 60\u201380%. Most of the ones I\u2019ve meet are Magyars, few Szekelyes, and the relations and communication were good. Some of them are a bit proud of their past, but Romanians have reasons to be proud of their origins too. In my town the Magyars are less than 5%, but still I had teachers, colleagues, neighbors with some Magyar ancestry, which didn\u2019t speak Magyar, and they were ok. I didn\u2019t meet too many who speak Magyar also, so I can\u2019t say anything about them, they might become haters much more easily at a point for whatever reasons than the ones who speak only Romanian and the languages learned in school as English and French.

            "answer_text": "I was born and grew up in a Transylvanian city with a sizable Hungarian minority which was dominant in the area where I experienced the very first years of my life. My mother and her parents spoke Hungarian fluently,my maternal grandmother had Hungarian as her first language.I was brought up with the philosophy of never offending Hungarians because of their ethnicity,many of them were my play comrades,I made no distinction whatsoever between Romanians and Hungarians. When I was four years old I moved together with my parents to a different area of the city where the dominant language was Romanian-for that reason I forgot most of the Hungarian language which I had learned as a little child-if I hear a conversation in Hungarian I can generally make out the meaning of the topic,my pronunciation is good(perfect?)but,unfortunately,I cannot speak it.Whenever in Hungarian speaking areas(both in Hungary and Romania)I feel at home(probably because I correlate the language with my childhood).
