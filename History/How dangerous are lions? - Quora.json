            "answer_text": "I mean.. I personally wouldn\u2019t consider them dangerous as I live half way across the world to them, would more than likely never have a face to face encounter with one, and I\u2019ve got more chance being killed by my own dog than I do a Lion. But, if you was to some how come across one on your own, whether that be in a zoo, in the wild, at a circus etc. And you\u2019re unarmed, then I\u2019d imagine they\u2019re pretty dangerous\u2026 Dogs kill much more people a year than most wild animals do, but you\u2019ve got much more chance fighting off a dog than you have a Lion. They\u2019re more than twice your weight, have knives attached to all of their feet, have teeth the length of your middle finger and have more power in one leg than you have in your entire body. I don\u2019t know how accurate that last one was to be honest..  But by looking at this photo, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s true.. I mean, look at them fricken muscles in his legs. That\u2019s insane. So in terms of how likely you are to die from a Lion attack, they\u2019re not very dangerous, you\u2019re actually MUCH more likely to be killed by a car or by drowning.. you\u2019re even more likely to die from accidentally eating something you didn\u2019t know you was allergic to. In terms of how dangerous they are when confronted by one and it decides to attack, my guess is that 99.9% of people won\u2019t make it out alive. Just to finish off, here are some statistics about how some deaths occur a year: Car crash: 1,300,000 (worldwide statistic) Suicide: 800,000 Drowning: 300,000+ Wildfires: 300,000+ Snakes: 50,000 Dogs: 20,000 (these aren\u2019t all maulings, but deaths caused by infectious bites) Crocodile: 1000 Hippopotamus: 500 Lions: 100\u2013250 (numbers vary a bit with Lions) Lightning strike: 30+ Wolves: 10 Sharks: 10 I\u2019m not 100% sure how accurate these all are, some are based on just one country, some are based world wide but regardless, you get my point. Hope this helped. Sources: http://asirt.org/Initiatives/Informing-Road-Users/Road-Safety-Facts/Road-Crash-Statistics What Animals Kill The Most Humans Each Year? ",

Lions are responsible for 250 deaths every year.[1] Lions who are hurt, or who are just really hungry, will turn to killing humans (we\u2019re very slow and easy to digest, but we aren\u2019t their natural prey). As for taming lions for entertainment: Lions can be trained, but never fully tamed. And while many of the same techniques used to train dogs are used to train lions, it is not that easy.[2] We\u2019ve bred dogs to be our companions for tens of thousands of years. We have not bred lions for behavior. Also, lion trainers raise their lions from the time they are still cubs. That forces a bond. Even so, even with all that on trainers\u2019 sides, many still get hurt and even die because a lion was having a bad day.[3] Footnotes[1] Top 10 deadliest animals on the planet [2] How Lion Taming Works[3] You are being redirected...",
