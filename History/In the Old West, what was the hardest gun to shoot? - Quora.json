            "answer_text": "Howdy, Hard? Colt designed a ring pull rifle. Sharps was easy to load\u2026but could you hit your target. Hand guns sound nice\u2026if they work\u2026if you can hit your target. Unlike the movies quarter mile on horseback\u2026you can not hit a barn (if it was standing still). Kentucky rifles were to be mastered, each was hand made, powder varied widely (same with muskets) French used 180 gr powder loads in their muskets. Spanish in Texas would shoot from the hip, resting their muskets on hip or saddle firing (lobbing bullets). Try carrying a 10\u201315 lb musket, at least a pound of shot, another pound of powder, be sure to have a pound of flints\u2026for a full day in search of game. It is not as easy as it sounds. ",
