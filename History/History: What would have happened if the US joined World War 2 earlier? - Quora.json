            "answer_text": "Paradoxically, the war would have lasted longer. America was a divided nation on the subject of war in 1939, with strong forces of isolationism opposing US involvement overseas. In our timeline, Pearl Harbor changed all that and galvanised the population into a total war effort that bent nearly every aspect of American life toward producing armaments, finance, and other support for the war. If America had declared war in 1939 along with France and Britain, they could not have moved sufficient force to Europe in time to save France, so the European war would have been roughly the same in 1939-41. But the Pacific War would likely not have happened in the 1940's. Japan would not have gambled on such a risky strategy as Pearl Harbor, and might not have needed to, because President Roosevelt might not have imposed such a punishing oil embargo if he were already embroiled in a European war. The result - Japan might have continued to brutalise East Asia while staying out of America's face, and established rule in China. The US would have fought in Europe, but without the 100% national commitment driven by the humiliation of Pearl Harbor, the drive would have been less, and Hitler's defeat postponed. Hitler would not have attacked Russia because in our timeline, he waited until Japan demonstrated the apparent weakness and gutlessness of America before feeling secure enough to invade. In this alternate timeline, he would already have been facing an additional, strong enemy, and the eastern border would have been uneasy but untroubled. The allies might have fought until 1947 to bring him down. After all, would the desperate Manhattan Project have had the resources committed to it without a Pacific war? I'm pretty sure it would not have. Hitler could conceivably have produced atomic bombs first, but I'm not going to go that far. Allied strategic bombing of German targets in the mid-1940's, enahnced by using broken codes, could reasonably have been expected to delay him until after the US built their bombs. End result would be the unconditional surrender of Germany in 1947, and the survival of the Empire of Japan at the time as a kind of mini-Soviet Union. China would not have regained sovereignty until 1987, and today, would have the status of a kind of larger version of Pakistan - a land of poverty, starvation, and militant religious radicals preparing to unleash hell on the world. in this case, Buddhist radicals. :) Hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "If the US had joined earlier, it would have been for the war in Europe.  The Pacific fleet would have sent assets to the Atlantic theater.  Japan wanted to run amok all over the South Pacific, so they would have still hit Hawaii.  Initially, support for the European war would have been unpopular until the Pearl Harbor attack.  Fewer battleships would have been damaged, resulting in less reliance on carriers.  Code breaking efforts would have been accelerated, causing Japan to change its encryption, making the battle at Midway a loss, resulting in Japan saving its carriers.  Originally, the US was on the brink of financial doom.  Entering the war sooner would have made it cost more, and the US would not have been able to fund the war to its inevitable victory.  The US would be have been forced to capitulate territories to Japan and Germany and negotiate a peace.  No one would ever have found out about the concentration camps until Hitler was long dead.  Japan would own a serious chunk of the Pacific.  Hitler would have used a V-2 type rocket to deliver an atomic bomb to DC and New York.  So many things in that war were the result of amazing timing, it's impossible to ask what if. ",
