            "answer_text": "\"How did Anglicanism win over Catholicism in England? How could the population simply be converted by royal decree because of the whims of one man (King Henry VIII)?\"The question is based on a false premise. The sequence of events does not seem to have been adequately explained to answer what I believe to have been your real question (but then I may be misinterpreting you!). Henry VIII had been and remained all his life, a staunch believer in the theology that underpinned the Roman Catholic Church. The then Pope had granted him a title \"Fidei Defensor\" (Defender of the Faith), because of staunch rebuttal of Protestantism in defence of the Roman Catholic Church long before the issues about his heir and legacy came to dominate his reign. The population as a whole were generally strongly Catholic, although amongst the better educated classes, the teachings of Luther and other protestant ideas had begun to creep into England. It was the norm to attend church, but, at that stage absence was usually punishable by a finger-wagging from the priest. The split with Rome because of Henry's attempts to obtain an annulment (not a divorce) from Katherine was not, of itself, the reformation that I think you are asking about. Let us analyse the issue of the annulment. The arbiter of all things religious in the Roman Catholic world was the Pope. He was especially the arbiter of any issue that affected the spiritual well-being of a family which included a God anointed sovereign. The history of relationships between European monarchs and the Pope is full of disputes and their relationships were not always simple of without rancour. Sometimes, even the hierarchy of the church was unable to live peaceably and schisms arose which at times caused there to be more than one pope in the Roman church, and at others absolute schisms which split the church. To believe that the issue of Henry and Katherine was a simple one of interpreting dogma and canon law would be na\u00efve and wrong. It is my belief that as a true believer, Henry really had reached the conclusion that God was punishing him for having married the widow of his elder brother. It was recognised as being against canon law, but the then Pope had granted the dispensation for the marriage based on the information that the first marriage, that between Arthur and Katherine, had not been consummated. The dispensation had been granted by the only authority entitled so to do; however, Henry, in reaching middle age without a male heir, argued, in effect, that the Pope may have made the decision, but that God did not necessarily agree with the Pope, and the resulting punishment of Henry was the lack of a male heir. The Pope at the time of the proposed annulment was entirely reliant for his own safety, and that of the Papal states of which he was the secular head of state, upon the then Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, the successor to Charlemagne. It was an unfortunate fact that this Emperor had an aunt. The aunt in question was Katherine, Queen of England. With the state of the politics in Italy in those years it was inconceivable that this Pope would have been persuaded to 'interpret' the canon law in any way other than in the favour of his protector. The need for a male heir dominated Henry's mind. Never, in the whole of English history, had their been a female queen regnant. There had been one woman who qualified (coincidentally the widow of a Holy Roman Emperor!), but a war had been fought to ensure that a king, with the ability to lead an army, was actually placed on the throne. Henry recognised that for the Tudor dynasty to continue and to thrive, he needed, above all else, a healthy male heir. The upshot was that there was a schism, not over religious doctrine, despite the fact that there were many doctrines being violently debated at that time, think of the English Bible debate! Henry being ultimately pragmatic, a politician and a proud king, recognised that by splitting from Rome, and having himself as titular head of the Church, he would benefit in a number of ways.1) He would be able to have the annulment he craved;2) He would be able to divert the tithe known as 'Peter's pence' into his own coffers, rather than it going to Rome;3) He would gain popularity by acceding to the growing clamour for a litany in the vernacular, which would allow for an English Bible;4) He would ensure that Rome was no longer, in any manner, able to dictate policy in England (there are certain parallels with the Brexit debate of today!) The break with Rome did send shockwaves through the Church in England, and those who were offended by the break from what they saw as the true faith were recalcitrant and resistant. Take the story of Sir Thomas More! However, there were sufficient Protestant leaning priests and bishops who taking sides with Henry were able to work with the king to create a whole new Credo. This was the birth of the Church OF England, but not fully the reformation - yet! The disputes about the supremacy of Henry, rather than the Pope, were answered not in theological terms but in wholly political ones. Those who resisted acknowledging Henry as the supreme head were placing themselves at risk. An oath was required to be made acknowledging the supremacy of the king, and those who refused were arrested and many were ultimately executed. In an effort to ensure that the whole of his kingdom were adhering to the new realpolitik in religious affairs the first of the real efforts to fully merge the church and state went ahead. It became compulsory to attend church services; churches were required to hold two services every Sunday; bishops became de facto legislators in the secular parliament; and the head of state and the head of the church were one and the same person, answerable only to God! Now, these things were not done on a whim, and neither were they simply a Royal decree. Parliament debated and created legislation to support these moves, ad the Church synod did likewise. Even today, measures passed by the Synod of the Church of England need approval by Parliament before those measures are enacted - this stems form these events. Going back to your question. The Anglican church now existed, because if was now the Church of England not the Church in England. It had adopted some early changes such as the holding of normal services in English and very quickly Henry authorised the printing of Bibles in English (something he had resisted years before). However, the average church service was otherwise unchanged, as was the d\u00e9cor within the church and the use of incense and ritual. The reformation proper was not really to take hold until the reigns of Edward VI and Elizabeth I. However, the increasingly dire consequences of not attending church meant that the average English man and woman was simply obliged to go to church, else be reported and prosecuted. However, at that time, there were relatively few changes, and most people simple went along with it. The later changes, alongside the compulsion of attendance and participation, meant that those who adhered to the Roman faith were increasingly ostracized and penalized. The events of the next three Tudor reigns were to cement the extremes of the increasingly polarized ideas of the Christian faith and to leave a legacy which still directly impacts on the daily lives of some living in these islands. So, in summary. There was no decree, it was a series of legal and theological changes that brought about the Church of England, but not in Henry's time the true reformation. It was however, the foundation for the reformation. The population clearly were not universally converted, Some were, and became devout in their new faith - ramifications for the English Civil War in the following century. Some simply pretended to adopt the faith and attended as they were required. Some remained Catholic, going underground with their faith and some became revolutionaries. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a little more complex than a simple decree by Henry VIII. In Europe more and more people were moving towards the teachings of the like of Martin Luther in Germany and protesting against the Catholic church. Books were being printed in places like the Netherlands and being distributed across Europe. Henry was a devout Catholic and deeply religious. However he had a greater task set for him by his father, to produce an heir. Now his first wife Catherine of Aragon had been married to his older brother who had died shortly after their marriage. Henry and Catherine were married because it was politically expedient. She gave him one daughter Mary who later became Mary I also known as Bloody Mary because of her later persecution of protestants. Catherine was unable to produce a male heir and things became urgent. Anne Boleyn played a very clever game. She wouldn\u2019t let Henry touch her until they were married. He was running around like a rampant horse unable to satisfy himself or the task put on him by his father. He petitioned the Pope to have his marriage to Catherine annulled as he was his brother\u2019s widow. The Pope refused and so after much trying Henry broke from the Catholic church and annulled his marriage. He married Anne but she only provided another girl , Elizabeth, later Elizabeth I. Henry had Thomas Cromwell concoct a treason case against her and she was executed. Henry then married Jane Seymour who gave him a son Edward but she died from complications resulting from childbirth. Edward was a devout Protestant. There was a great deal of conflict with the Catholics particularly those that were being influenced by Spain and France. This resulted in executions of Catholics for following their faith. When Edward died quite young the crown passed to Mary, a rabid catholic who was married to the King of Spain. The tables turned completely with the protestants being persecuted. Elizabeth was a protestant but not so rabid as her siblings. She was happy to promote the protestant faith but was fairly amiable to catholics. Some of her advisers were not so forgiving and interference from Spain and France led to many plots against her culminating in the attempted invasion thwarted by the defeat of the Armada. When Elizabeth died without issue James VI of Scotland became the first of England. He was a protestant but tried to align both religions. Unfortunately the Catholics continued to work with Spain to overthrow the crown. By this time the Anglican Church was well established as the faith of the English ",
