            "answer_text": "I'm not very good with this subject, but this is how I understand it:Our DNA is made up of 4 nucleotides, thymine, cytosine, adenine and guanine, witten commonly in code as T, C, A, and G.RNA is also made up of nucleotides, but instead of thymine, it can have uracil.But I've also heard that RNA can have 5 different nucleotides so I assume it may still potentially have thymine, aswell. I don't know if DNA could potentially have 5, aswell, but that they naturally don't.Someone more knowledgable might fill in where I'm wrong or missing important info. ",
