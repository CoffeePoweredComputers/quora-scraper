            "answer_text": "None of those are causes of conflict. People who were blessed by Satan are deceived and conflicted inside. People blessed by the aw of God took education in missionary schools to tribal lands so they may eevate themselves to compete internationally, the same. People who wonder why they are ordered to respect their own people and hate other people must be conflicted. We are designed to notice and reject being harmed by others. It is mental illness to enjoy deception and harming others. Conflict only happens when people disagree about how one affects the life of another. That never has to end violently or malevolently. Usually there is a mutually beneficial trade-off between parties. Most people seek harmonious ways. Nobody went to war before negotiating trade anywhere. Every person prefers love as we are all Created in the image of God and His Universe, He created all things; His Creation only thrives in harmony and love. So our minds are designed in the same law to thrive. Don\u2019t you crave love? Don\u2019t you wish only love on all people? That is God\u2019s law. Genesis 12 verse 3 tells us who would be a blessing to all nations. Colonists introduced benefits that had never arrived on tribal primitive lands. There were no nations outside Europe. Only tribal clans that worked for their own tribe and fought wars among themselves. Colonists took education, the Word of God and structured forms of national government and law for governing large nations. In Mark 12 \u201c\u2026.he asked Jesus, \u201cWhich of the commands is most important?\u201d 29 Jesus answered, \u201cThe most important command is this: \u2018Listen, people of Israel! The Lord our God is the only Lord. 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, and all your strength.\u2019[d] 31 The second command is this: \u2018Love your neighbor as you love yourself.\u2019[e] There are no commands more important than these.\u201d It is only evil that seeks to deceive and infiltrate to steal the accomplisjments of superior achievement that was accomplished with God\u2019s blessing through love and enlightenment; millennia of technology, science and business skill documented for generation after generation to build on. Evil destroys these things and prevents education. The blessing Acts 3:25,26 explains that the promise, \u201cIn your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed,\u201d was fulfilled when God sent Jesus \u201cto bless you, in turning away every one of you from your iniquities.\u201d So the blessing God promised was forgiveness of sins through Jesus\u2019 death. This was the ultimate solution to the problem of sin. Sin and its curse had been introduced in Eden when Adam and Eve sinned. The solution was brought by Christ, the descendant of Abram, as here promised. All nations This promised salvation came through the descendants of Abraham because Jesus would be born as an Israelite: a descendant of Abraham through the nation of Israel. This promise became the focal point of Bible history as God worked through Israel to bring Christ into the world. But the blessing itself (salvation) was to come upon all families or nations. Not just the descendants of Abraham, but all people \u2013 regardless of nationality or ancestry \u2013 may receive the blessing of forgiveness of sins by the blood of Jesus. Revelation 5:9 \u2013 Jesus redeemed to God by His blood people of every tribe and tongue and people and nation. Mark 16:15,16 \u2013 Jesus said, \u201cGo into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.\u201d This great blessing that God promised was made available to all people \u2013 including you and me \u2013 when Jesus died on the cross so we could receive forgiveness of sins. It is this sacrifice that we remember each first day of the week in the Lord\u2019s Supper. But conflict and massacre is commanded by Satans law- \"O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness.\" it is commanded until the end day. Nothing about building and blessing. Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 484: - \u201c\u2026\u2026.said, \u2018A prophet must slaughter before collecting captives. A slaughtered enemy is driven from the land. \u2026\u2026\u2026., you craved the desires of this world, its goods and the ransom captives would bring. But \u2026\u2026. desires killing them to manifest the religion.\u2019\u201d \"...See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders? Is it then they who will win?\" Nothing about building and blessing. \"Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness with it.\" it is commanded until the end day. \"And when We wish to destroy a town, We send Our commandment to the people of it who lead easy lives, but they transgress therein; thus the word proves true against it, so We destroy it with utter destruction.\" it is commanded until the end day. Nothing about building and blessing. ",
