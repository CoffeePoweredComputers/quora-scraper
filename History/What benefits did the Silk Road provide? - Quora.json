            "answer_text": "The Silk Road provided a safe and anonymous marketplace for goods that could not be sold by any other website. These goods are bought and sold daily in the underground marketplaces throughout the world, but usually in face-to-face exchanges putting both buyer and seller in danger. The Silk Road operated as a neutral online platform to streamline the process so that buyers and sellers were protected by anonymity. The Silk Road Forums were fascinating to read, and gave some context to why the marketplace was so popular. The most memorable post I saw as from a gentleman with a heartbreaking story. His sister had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and her health was rapidly deteriorating. He had heard of a pioneering new drug treatment for MS that was approved for use in the European Union, but the Food and Drug Administration had rejected proposals to conduct clinical tests in the United States. Afraid that his sister would not live to take advantage of the drug, he inquired if any Silk Road sellers might be able to obtain it for him. Within hours of posting his query, no fewer than four different SR sellers offered to provide not just one, but two different MS drugs available in the EU that were forbidden in the U.S. ",
