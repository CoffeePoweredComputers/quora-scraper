            "answer_text": "Vice-President Gerald Ford became President Ford upon President Nixon\u2019s cowering out of the White House. President Ford had the choice of going w/o a Vice-President, or picking one. President Ford asked Governor Nelson Rockefeller to be his VP. But Rocky, as he was known in NYS, had to sell his soul to the Senate Judiciary Committee, then, if approved, hope for a majority vote to confirm. He would become Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller. When Ford was shot at, even though the bullets were nowhee close to him, Rocky was close to the Oval Office. I doubt he wanted to be President due to assassination, and Ford was never shot. Both women who tried to kill Ford went on trial. Each got 99 years. Each were paroled about 10 years ago, but. Each has a lifetime parole. Neither can even get a parking ticket, or something else illegal. If they do/did, back to jail for the remainder of the 99 years. ",

            "answer_text": "Pre-25th Amendment (1965): nobody becomes the new VP. The office remains vacant until the next regularly scheduled inauguration day. To give one example: James Madison\u2019s first Vice President, George Clinton, died in April of 1812. We did not have a VPOTUS until the next inauguration (March 4th, 1813, after Madison won a second term with running mate Elbridge Gerry.) But Gerry died in November 1814, leaving another VPOTUS vacancy that was not filled until James Monroe and his running mate Daniel Tompkins were inaugurated on March 4th, 1817. It would be no different if VPOTUS acceded to the Presidency because of a Presidential death or resignation: John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson et al. did not have Vice Presidents because they had been elevated to the Presidency. Thanks to these long and frequent gaps, the office of VPOTUS had been vacant for a total of over 37 years from the founding of the republic to 1965. Post-25th Amendment: POTUS nominates a new Vice President, with a simple majority in both Houses of Congress required for confirmation. This process has been used twice: Gerald Ford became VPOTUS in 1973 after Spiro Agnew resigned, and then Nelson Rockefeller became VPOTUS in 1974 after Nixon\u2019s resignation elevated Ford to the Presidency.
