            "answer_text": "Here are some history hot potatoes in China.  1. Should the \"Yuan\" and \"Qing\" dynasties be considered as Chinese dynasties.  Many Han Chinese nationalists consider Yuan and Qing as foreign dynasties, and were when Chinese people were ruled by outsiders.  2. When did China lose the technological edge it once had.  History textbooks in China often depict ancient China as something \"way more advanced\" when compared to all the other ancient civilisations back then. Textbooks usually put the date when China lost it's edge at somewhere in the 16th Century. However, many debate this. Han nationalists often put this date at the 17th Century, even the 18th Century, while others say it would be in the 15th Century. I, among others, believe that ancient China, though certainly advanced, was not advanced enough to take on the entire world singlehandedly, and if have to answer when did China became inferior technologically, I put this date at mid-15th Century. 3. How long ago can the Chinese civilisation be traced back Traditionally, people claim the Chinese civilisation is 5,000 years old. This claim assumes that our civilisation began at about 3,000 B.C, back in the mythic \"Three Sovereign and Five Emperors\" period. Others are more skeptical, putting the origin of the Chinese civilisation at the Xia dynasty, 4,000 years ago, but the existence of Xia is still debated. ",
