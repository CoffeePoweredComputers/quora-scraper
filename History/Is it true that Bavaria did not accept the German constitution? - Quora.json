            "answer_text": "Yes and no. The Bavarian government at the time felt the Grundgesetz shifted too much power to the federal government and did not ensure sufficient involvement of the states. So they made two proposals at once: To reject the GrundgesetzTo declare acceptance of the Grundgesetz for Bavaria if at least two thirds of the other initial states would ratify it as set out in its Art. 144.So the Bavarian parliament decided in a first vote that they would reject the Grundgesetz with a vote of 101 against 63 (with 9 not voting and 7 absent). In the very same session they however also took the second vote, that the Grundgesetz should be binding upon Bavaria if 2/3 of the other states would accept it. This vote resulted in 97 members in favor, 6 against and 70 not voting. (These 70 mostly contained people that had voted in favor of the Grundgesetz before, since they felt this tactics to be childish.) Since five states (Baden, Bremen, Hamburg, Rheinland-Pfalz, W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden) had already voted in favor of the Grundgesetz two days before and the rest had votes up for the same or the following day. In all the other states it was mostly undisputed they were fully aware that the second vote would mean acceptance. An excerpt from Hans Ehard\u2019s (Prime Minister\u2019s) speech (loose translation): If we deem something not right, we are allowed to say no. We have this democratic right. But we also want the right to evade factual diffamation for its exercise. This is our stance and we don\u2019t want more. To avoid any ambiguity, we put up this second question on purpose. And now I ask this house: If I cannot agree to something, but still want to submit myself to democratic rules of play, may I not say so? Is it an offence, which I would have to be ashamed of? Is this an ambiguity? - No way! Also you will submit to the constitution since you accept its binding power. [\u2026 reaction to an interjection \u2026] Others also reject it, but we submit ourselves; yes: we submit ourselves to this constitution, because we also want to comply with the constitution [presumably he means the Bavarian one, which sets out that Bavaria shall become member of a German state], we want to comply with the law just as much as you! The closing remarks of the Speaker of the House reflect this: I thin we are in agreement in this house: The majority of the house has offered criticism on the Grundgesetz, as expressed in its vote. But I also have to establish, that the far bigger majority of this house was unified by the thought, to further our German home country, through contributing our Bavarian part to the reconstruction done in Bonn. So, even if they were complicated, they actually accepted it. If they had not had this cheap way out, I presume they would have mostly voted in favor. If you know German and and can read Gothic type, the whole thing makes an interesting read: https://www.bayern.landtag.de/www/ElanTextAblage_WP01/Protokolle/01%20Wahlperiode%20Kopie/01%20WP%20Plenum%20LT%20Kopie/110%20PL%20190549%20ges%20endg%20Kopie.pdf (BTW I love the Speaker\u2019s introduction asking the members to make their interjections witty.)

            "answer_text": "Only at first. Bavaria sent delegates to the \u201cParlamentarian Council\u201d that was working on the Basic Law that would become the new constitution. However, the CSU that had the majority in Bavaria wanted the states to have more powers and so the CSU members of the Parlamentarian Council were the only ones aside from the 2 KPD communists who voted against it. Bavaria then at first voted against accepting the Basic Law, but after all other states had accepted it Bavaria voted again to accept it as well (\u201call other states\u201d means all those who had sent delegates, which didn\u2019t include Eastern Germany under Soviet Control and the Saar under French control. The Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957 after a short time of independence, and Eastern Germany joined in 1990). ",
