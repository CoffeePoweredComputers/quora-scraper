            "answer_text": "No I haven't. I probably could if I really wanted to (I have been playing games for over 25 years now), if I have played the game a few times and know how/where to anticipate its challenges. But I am more interested in taking my time, soaking in everything the game has to offer, and save often to resume my progress. I might still try to do a 'no-saves' run some day as a challenge. ",
