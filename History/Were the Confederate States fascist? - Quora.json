            "answer_text": "Quite the opposite. In a fascist state the government controls business. (\u201cAll within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state.\u201d Benito Mussolini) The Confederate states were an attempt to return to something similar to the weak central state in the Articles of Confederation, in which the wealthy business (i.e., plantation) owners held the political power. The very existence of the Confederacy owed itself to a plutocracy more powerful than the state. If you want an example of fascism in the US you have to wait for the Progressive movement. The tail end of the Wilson administration looks very much fascist, and indeed Mussolini gave credit in some areas where it was due. Many would also argue that FDR's New Deal had a good deal of fascism built in, though it also had some differences. Had the National Recovery Administration been allowed to stand (and its head, General Johnson actually had a portrait of Mussolini in his office!) it would have been very hard to argue that the US wasn't fascist. It's fascinating that the subsequent court-packing threat ended the Supreme Court's limitation of executive power without our realizing how close that was to allowing fascism. And hardly an eyelash was batted recently when the idea was revived! ",

            "answer_text": "No. They were as American as Coca Cola. They still are. There were among the Southerners slave owners just as there were slave owners among Northerners. Most Americans did not own slaves. Slavery was still an institution in many parts of the world, even as it is today. Slavery did nor define America or Americans then, no more than it does now. Slavery was a dying institution even before the Civil War in USA with the advent of the machine age, which has been instrumental in eliminating slavery in Great Britain. It is sad that our press is still fighting the Civil War as a surrogate for our Democrats to keep anger kindled between the races. I think all white people on this page are like I am- we want nothing more than to heal racially, and get on with our lives. ",
