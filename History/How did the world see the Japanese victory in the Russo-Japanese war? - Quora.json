Prior to the war in general and the naval engagement at the Battle of Tsushima Strait in particular, no Asian nation had ever defeated a European country in a general war since the days of the Mongol Hordes.  Chart Showing Basic Weapons and Clothing Used by Russian and Japanese Soldiers in the 1904\u20135 Russo-Japanese War Russo-Japanese War | Russo-Japanese history Friction between the two nations had begun in the last decade of the 19th century, when Czarist Russian expansion into eastern Mongolia and the northern Manchurian - Chinese coastlands came into conflict with Japanese designs on the same region. Japan began the war with a surprise naval attack on the Russian battleships based at Port Arthur and followed up with amphibious landings. Gigantic land battles with massive casualties quickly ensued. In many ways these were precursors of the hideous slaughter that would come a decade later in the First World War.  Japanese Infantry During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20135  Russian Soldiers on the March Near the Yalu River  Russian Soldiers in Trenches During the Russo-Japanese War Inept and corrupt Russian leadership frequently undermined its own numerical superiority, but Japan was unable to fully capitalize on its generally better tactics and strategy and her army failed to land a war-winning blow. Meanwhile the Baltic Fleet sailed from its northern European bases all the way around Africa and across the Indian Ocean in an attempt to relieve and reinforce the Russian army, which had been defeated by the Japanese in March 1905 at the Battle of Mukden. Mukden, however, was a Pyrrhic victory due to Japan\u2019s own enormous losses and thus successful reinforcement by the Baltic Fleet might have turned the entire war\u2014increasingly unpopular in Russia\u2014in favor of the Czarist forces. Bloodbath at Mukden: Imperial Russia and Japan Collide As the Russian Baltic Fleet approached, it was detected by Japanese scouts and almost every major unit in the Japanese Fleet moved to intercept. The two forces met in the Tsushima Strait between Korea and Japan in what became the climactic battle of the war, and also one of the most decisive naval engagements in all of history. As the ships closed to firing range, Japanese Admiral Heihachiro Togo hoisted his \u201cZ\u201d flag, alone and without any additional signals. Every man in the Japanese force knew what this meant. In a deliberate echo of British Admiral Nelson\u2019s use of his own Z flag at the Battle of Trafalgar a century before, Togo was telling his sailors: \"The fate of the Empire rests on the outcome of this battle. Let each man do his utmost\".

The Battleship Knyaz Suvarov is Leading the Formation. Another Battleship, Probably Borodino, is On Fire and Sinking. Tsushima was an overwhelming Japanese victory. Nearly every Russian ship, from the battleships down to the smallest colliers and support vessels, was either destroyed or captured. Some Japanese ships sustained damage\u2014Mikasa herself was hit 40 times\u2014but their overall losses were relatively light. Among the wounded was the future commander in chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy, Isoroku Yamamoto, who lost two fingers on his left hand when a Russian shell struck his ship, the armored cruiser Nisshin. Pressed into service as a ship of the line because 2 of Japan\u2019s 6 battleships had been destroyed by Russian mines around Port Arthur, Nisshin took 13 hits during the battle, the second most for any Japanese unit at Tsushima.

The war between Japan and Russia was watched with great interest around the world, particularly in the US and Great Britain. It is believed that British espionage aided the Japanese in their siege and subsequent capture of Port Arthur, though the single biggest factor in their victory was probably the cowardice and inept leadership of several of the highest ranking Russian commanders, three of whom were court-martialled after the war.

            "answer_text": "Surprise. It was something of a turning point. The last time an Asian power had defeated a European nation was the Ottoman Conquest of the Balkans before being turned back from the gates of Vienna. Russia was a \u201cGreat Power\u201d and Japan was considered a minor or rising power at the time, and for a \u201cGreat Power\u201d to lose\u2014not a battle, but a decisive war with a smaller power was humiliating. It caused so much upheaval in Russia there was a \u201cpartial revolution\u201d and the Czar was forced to grant a Constitution and an elected assembly (the Duma) which was abhorrent to him and his beliefs about autocracy. He would later consider it to be the biggest mistake of his life\u2014which considering the fate of the last Czar and his family that says a lot. For Japan it raised its status to a \u201cGreat Power\u201d and sent the more racist elements in Europe and the US into a panic. England, while nominally friendly with Russia had found itself growing fonder of Japan and happy to see Russia\u2019s humiliation as a revenge for the Pariah status the British had developed because of the Boer War. In Germany the military elites became anxious to go to war with Russia, Russia was rapidly industrializing and with her larger population and vast natural resources Russia had the potential to recover and over take Germany. Russia was humiliated and chastised but not anxious to go to war again, even during the July crisis of 1914 the Russian government refused to promise to support Serbia, the Russian ambassador in Belgrade telling the Serbian government to evacuate south in case of an Austo-Hungarian attack. Russia felt they would not be ready for a general war until 1917, making Germany wanting to strike in a \u201cnow or never\u201d feeling before then. For Japan they now had control of Korea and were poised to strike at China. They would be an allied power in the first war, and, with Europe weakened by it would decided in the early 30s to attack China for resources. Their cruelty would raise the ire of another rising power, the United States which would speed up the collision course those two nations were on, which would end with the flash and bang of Atomic bombs.

            "answer_text": "The most surprising aspect of the Russo-Japanese war was the performance of the Japanese navy. The Russians tended to move their fleet in an untidy mass where the faster more modern lightly-gunned ships plunged steadfast ahead, while leaving the more massive heavy-gunned ships at various states of disarray and despair. The Japanese concentrated on picking these slower ships off at piecemeal, and quickly retreated before the front-end could turn itself around. Perhaps, these earlier victories had given the Japanese the false confidence that these tactics would work well against a similarly situated American fleet. To the surprise of the Japanese, Americans had developed convoy arrangements, with aircraft carriers within a stone\u2019s throw. ",
