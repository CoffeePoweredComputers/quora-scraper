            "answer_text": "That is a truly excellent question. In the book \u201cSapiens\u201d, Yuval Noah Harari devotes a whole chapter to exploring it, without coming to any really solid conclusions. He points out that, women have never, in any society that we know of, held primary political or economic power on a large scale. Even society that had female rulers generally just had one woman at the top of a completely male power structure (and when those women died, men went right back to being in charge). This can\u2019t be a cultural or political trend, because it\u2019s universal. If something happens in every single society, it has to be cause by something innate in human nature or biology. Harari points out that the primary biological arguments are male strength and female pregnancy, but argues that neither of these are entirely convincing. The \u201cstrength\u201d argument is simply that, because men are physically more powerful (and arguably more inclined to aggression and violence), they\u2019ve always been able to physically keep women oppressed, as well as being vital to keeping societies fed. The problem with this is that there\u2019s no clear correlation between being strong and holding political power. In most societies, positions of power are held by old men who are incapable of fighting or physical labor. In many societies, the nobility have never worked a day in their lives. It\u2019s not uncommon for governments to be run by men who\u2019ve never held a sword. Some societies expect their nobility to be fighters, but certainly not all. Genuine power consists of being able to create structures of power, law, money and loyalty to where you can get other people to work and fight for you. Women are no less capable than men of creating such structures, so it\u2019s not hard to imagine women overseeing armies of male warriors and workers, with themselves in a position of power. And yet, this never happens. The \u201cpregnancy\u201d argument is a bit more convincing. That\u2019s the argument that women, particularly in pre-modern times, spend a significant portion of their lives either pregnant or caring for small children. This occupies a huge amount of their time and mental bandwidth, and it makes them vulnerable and dependent. The argument goes that this has long kept them from seizing power and made them dependent on men. The problem with this is that it assumes that pregnant women have to be dependent on men, rather than on other women. Harari points out that other social animals have strong networks of women who protect and care for the ones who are pregnant (he gives elephants as an example), making the bulls more or less irrelevant to the childbearing process other than sperm donation. As for creating power networks, there\u2019s no reason why at least some women couldn\u2019t outsource the work of child-rearing, and concentrate their efforts on getting themselves into power. Wealthy women in many societies have employed others to take care of their children, even from a very early age. And that leads nicely into what I think the real driver is. Now, this is controversial, and I don\u2019t mean offense, but there does seem, to me, to be a more basic trend here, which is that women generally don\u2019t work together. This is just my own observation, but I\u2019ve seen in happen in multiple countries across multiple decades and multiple social, economic and age groups. Guys seem to very easily form bonds and connections where they look out for one another. When women get into groups, they seem to, almost immediately start undercutting one other. When guys in a group have a conflict, they either let it go or fight it out. When women are mad at each other, they seem to nurse grudges for years. And this may seem like a gendered stereotype, but it happens so often that it really seems to be something innate. Now, on a social level, these differences may seem minor, men and women just relate to each other differently. But the ability of guys to form these \u201cOld Boys Clubs\u201d where they\u2019re actually looking out for, advancing and defending one another, is hugely powerful. Like so many things involved in the acquisition of power, it can be horrific, and this isn\u2019t about one way being right or wrong, it\u2019s just the way things seem to be. The ability of one group to work together means it\u2019s easier for them to maneuver themselves into a position of power, while women are left trying to succeed in a world controlled by men. Individual women may succeed in that, but women as a gender are in a much weaker position because they don\u2019t form the same kind of united front. As was said, this seems to be innate in human psychology, or it wouldn\u2019t be universal. I don\u2019t know if culture and social training could overcome that, or even if women would want it to (that kind of in-group loyalty absolutely has dark sides to it). But that would explain why, in every society in history, men put themselves in charge, and then proceeded to treat women pretty much however they wanted. ",

            "answer_text": "Why have women been oppressed through the ages? A man couldn\u2019t know for certain, before DNA testing, that he was indeed the father of his children. Controlling women of breeding age, and specifically controlling access to women (and women\u2019s access to other men), gave men some measure of comfort that they were not raising another man\u2019s children \u2014 or that a rival\u2019s offspring would inherit his wordly goods and titles. It\u2019s also the reason that virgin brides were (are?) so prized and why a woman\u2019s sexual \u201cstraying\u201d has historically been severely punished.Because greed. Until relatively recently, men gained complete, legal control over his wife\u2019s material possessions (and her body) upon marriage, including her children, and was entitled to all her earnings during the marriage. A wife often was left destitute after a divorce, a divorce that usually could be instigated only by the man.Because men have made the rules for millenia, and historically the group in power always oppresses the group(s) out of power or in the minority.Because most men are physically larger and stronger than most women.Hmmm \u2026 so, suppose we oppress women and eliminate 50 percent of the competition, some of whom are (or could be) better at what we do? Besides, the home is \u201ctheir\u201d domain, right? Hmmm \u2026 if we deny women the right to vote or hold office, we effectively deny them the means to change the laws we passed! You know, the ones giving us legal control over their lives and fortunes. Hmmm \u2026 suppose we put in writing, in religious texts and laws, a lot of stuff about obeying your father and deferring to your husband, and how we big strong men have to protect frail women! Then how can they disagree with custom, tradition, the church, the law? Hmmm \u2026 if we deny or restrict females\u2019 access to education, we can make them believe anything we want, and we can ignore everything they say as \u201cignorant\u201d! We must now also make a solemn pact to ridicule and denigrate any woman so bold as to educate herself and develop her own opinions. ",
