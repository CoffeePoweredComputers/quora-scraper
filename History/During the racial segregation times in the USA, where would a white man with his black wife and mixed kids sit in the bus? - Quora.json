            "answer_text": "This is my general knowledge and I\u2019m open to correction on it, but here it is: Interracial marriage was illegal in most states of the USA until 1967, when laws prohibiting such marriages were declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court (Loving v. Virginia - Wikipedia). Relatively few White men were in open, known relationships with Black women. If a Black woman did have children with a White man in those days (especially in the states of the old Confederacy), (or vice versa, which was even more rare) in most situations, the identity of the father was mostly kept quiet (the relationship may or may not even have been consensual) and the children were identified as Black, and generally absorbed/assimilated fully inside the Black community and subject to the same discrimination and mistreatment common to that era (partly as a result, the average African-American is about 25% White by DNA analysis). There is a story of a Black woman (Essie Mae Washington-Williams - Wikipedia) who was the illegitimate daughter of a White man, future U.S. Senator, who lived most of her entire life as a Black woman, inside the Black community, with little knowledge of her father, a distant relationship with him at best, and only nominal privilege afforded to her as a result of that status. Others like this mixed-race woman had even fewer opportunities. ",

            "answer_text": "I cannot speak for what a white man with a black wife and kids would do, but I am a child of an interracial marriage - my Chinese father and white mother, a native of Alabama, got married in Washington, DC in 1960. Both Virginia and Maryland had anti-miscegenation laws and we could not live there. Virginia\u2019s anti-miscegenation laws were very strict. Maryland was a bit more liberal and we sometimes went there, but Virginia was like \u201cthe dark side\u201d, and we never crossed the river together as a family. Regarding going to visit my mother\u2019s family in Alabama, we never traveled together as a family. The only time that both my mother and father were in Alabama at the same time - they traveled there separately - and that was in the same month following the freedom riders who were beat up and set on fire in my mother\u2019s hometown. We did not travel there together as a family until 1968, after the anti-miscegenation laws were repealed. ",
