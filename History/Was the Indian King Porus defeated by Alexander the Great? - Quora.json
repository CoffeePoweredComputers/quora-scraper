            "answer_text": "According to all surviving ancient historical sources, King Alexandros III of Makedonia (most commonly known in English as \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d) defeated King Porus (whose name is conjectured to have been Puru in his native tongue) of the Indian kingdom of Paurava in the Battle of the Hydaspes in May 326 BC. Although Alexander was ultimately victorious, Porus and his men fought valiantly. The Battle of the Hydaspes was the closest one Alexander ever came to losing and he was reportedly so impressed by Porus\u2019s valor that he asked him how he wished to be treated. Porus replied that he wished to be treated the way Alexander would have wanted Porus to have treated him. Alexander therefore appointed Porus as satrap of his own kingdom and the lands to the southeast as well. Until I started writing answers on Quora, I had never heard anyone try to argue that Porus actually defeated Alexander in battle. We have nothing in our sources to suggest that and, as I shall explain in a moment, we have very good reason to doubt this assertion. Nonetheless, since I started writing answers on Quora around a year ago, I have discovered that there seems to be something of an obsession among Indian and Pakistani nationalists with \u201cproving\u201d that Alexander really lost and that the accepted narrative is a fabrication by the Greek historians who idolized Alexander. In the answer, I intend to examine the historical evidence supporting the historical consensus that Alexander really did win the Battle of the Hydaspes. I doubt I will convince any hardcore Indian or Pakistani nationalists, but I am not writing this answer for them; I am writing it for those who are genuinely interested in knowing what really happened.  ABOVE: Painting by the French painter Charles Le Brun depicting Alexander and Porus in the Battle of the Hydaspes The Indian nationalist version I have already told you the account of the outcome of the battle that is accepted by historians. Now, here is more-or-less the revised history that some Indian and Pakistani nationalists are promoting: Alexander not only lost to King Porus in the Battle of the Hydaspes, but he was utterly whupped and forced to flee into retreat and leave India forever. The Indian and Pakistani nationalists typically claim that the accepted history in which Alexander won the battle is just propaganda made up by Greek historians to make Alexander look good. Our written sources for the Battle of the Hydaspes There are five main surviving written sources that provide us with most of our information on Alexander the Great\u2019s campaigns in general and the Battle of the Hydaspes in particular. Of these, the source that is generally considered the most reliable is the Anabasis of Alexander, written by the Greek historian Arrianos of Nikomedia (lived c. 89 \u2013 after c. 160 AD). The other major sources for Alexander\u2019s campaigns are the Universal History by the Greek historian Diodoros Sikeliotes (lived c. 90 \u2013 c. 30 BC), the Historiae Alexandri Magni by the Roman historian Quintus Curtius Rufus (lived c. first century AD), the Life of Alexander the Great by the Greek biographer Ploutarchos of Chaironeia (lived c. 46 \u2013 c. 120 AD), and the Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus by the Roman historian Marcus Iunianus Iustinus Frontinus (lived c. second century AD). These sources, in turn, rely on earlier sources that have since been lost. Alexander\u2019s personal campaign historian Kallisthenes (lived c. 360 \u2013 327 BC) was an important source for these writers, providing them with much information about Alexander\u2019s earlier campaigns. Kallisthenes was dead by the time of the Battle of the Hydaspes, though, so he obviously never wrote about it. Nonetheless, there were many other writers who covered the period after Kallisthenes\u2019s death. For instance, Ptolemaios I Soter and Nearchos, two of Alexander the Great\u2019s generals who outlived him, both wrote accounts of his conquests, which would have included the Battle of the Hydaspes. Meanwhile, Aristoboulos of Kassandreia, a junior officer in Alexander\u2019s army, and Onesikritos, Alexander\u2019s helmsman, also wrote accounts of his conquests. In addition to the sources covering the campaigns of Alexander, there were also other Greek sources covering Indian history that some of the authors of the surviving sources are known to have used. The Greek historian Megasthenes (lived c. 350 \u2013 c. 290 BC), who served as an ambassador of Seleukos I Nikator to Chandragupta Maurya, wrote a history of India titled Indika, which was used extensively as a source by some of our surviving writers, including Arrianos and Diodoros Sikeliotes.  ABOVE: Photograph from Wikimedia Commons of an edition of Arrianos\u2019s Anabasis of Alexander from 1575. Arrianos\u2019s account of the campaigns of Alexander the Great is generally considered the most reliable. Couldn\u2019t have been made up by Greek historians The vast majority of these early writers were writing independently. If Alexander had really lost the Battle of the Hydaspes and the story about him winning were really an invention of Greek historians, then we would expect to find major inconsistencies in our sources concerning the outcome of the battle. We would expect to find some sources claiming Alexander totally won, other sources claiming Porus won but Alexander fought valiantly, and other sources claiming that the accounts of the battle are contradictory. Instead, all of our surviving sources agree that Alexander won the Battle of the Hydaspes. None of them ever mention the existence of an alternative version of the story in which Alexander lost the battle. It is almost inconceivable that all these authors, working independently, could have managed to come up with the same lie. This shows that, if Alexander\u2019s victory were indeed a lie, it couldn\u2019t have been a lie on the part of the historians. Instead, the lie could only have originated with Alexander himself. The fact that none of the Greek historians could have made Alexander\u2019s victory up on their own is also confirmed by the fact that Alexander himself issued a series of coins commemorating his victory over Porus. These coins were minted between c. 324 BC and c. 322 BC. A number of them have survived to the present day. Clearly, Alexander himself claimed that he had won.  ABOVE: Silver victory coin of Alexander the Great, minted in Babylon at some point between c. 324 and c. 322 BC, depicting a Makedonian warrior on horseback and two Indian warriors on the back of an elephant Logistical problems with Alexander claiming victory in spite of defeat There are serious logistical problems, though, with the idea of Alexander claiming victory when he really lost. For one thing, there would have been literally tens of thousands of surviving eyewitnesses to the battle at the time when the earliest historians such as Ptolemaios I Soter, Nearchos, Aristoboulos, Onesikritos, and Megasthenes were writing. Alexander the Great\u2019s army at the Battle of the Hydaspes is estimated to have included around 40,000 infantry and between 5,000 to 7,000 cavalry. Meanwhile, Porus\u2019s army at the Battle of the Hydaspes is estimated to have included somewhere between 20,000 and 50,000 infantry, between 2,000 and 4,000 cavalry, around 130 war elephants (each of which would have probably carried two warriors), and around 1,000 chariots. It was, all in all, quite a massive confrontation. If Alexander had really lost the battle, then the tens of thousands of people who survived the battle would have all known that he was lying when he claimed victory over Porus. It is exceedingly difficult to persuade the public that you won a battle that you really lost if there are tens of thousands of people who know full well that you really lost the battle. Furthermore, King Porus was still alive at the time when Alexander was minting his victory coins. If, as Indian and Pakistani nationalists claim, he really won the Battle of the Hydaspes and was still ruling his kingdom at this time, he presumably would have been pretty annoyed by Alexander claiming that he had won. If Porus really won, then we are left wondering why he never tried to stop Alexander from claiming victory. Why didn\u2019t he invade or launch a propaganda campaign of his own? All in all, there are serious problems with the idea that Alexander could have just claimed victory despite having actually been defeated. The simplest and most logical conclusion here is that Alexander really won, just as all the historical sources record. Greek influence in India Another problem with the claim that Alexander could have just claimed victory without having actually won is that Alexander\u2019s conquests were followed by centuries of Greek influence in the northwest part of the Indian subcontinent. Alexander himself either founded or renamed two cities on the banks of the Hydaspes River, Boukephala and Nikaia. If Alexander really lost the Battle of the Hydaspes as so many Indian and Pakistani nationalists claim, we have to seriously wonder how he managed to name two cities located so close to the site of the battle immediately afterwards. Furthermore, the Seleukid, Greco-Baktrian, and Indo-Greek kingdoms all had influence in this region throughout the Hellenistic Period (lasted c. 323 \u2013 c. 31 BC). An entire genre of Greco-Buddhist art came to flourish in the region. The city of Gandhara is known for its astounding Greco-Buddhist sites. Meanwhile, some of the earliest known statues of the Buddha display him in a heavily Greek-influenced fashion. If Alexander really lost the Battle of the Hydaspes, then one would have to come up with an explanation for why the influence of Greek culture became so pervasive in the region for centuries afterwards. While the influence of Greek culture in the region does not necessarily rule out the possibility that Alexander could have secretly lost the battle in and of itself, it does make this idea seem a lot less likely. When you take into consideration that all the historical sources agree that Alexander won the battle, the evidence for Alexander\u2019s victory become pretty compelling.  ABOVE: Photograph of a Greco-Buddhish freestanding stone statue of the Buddha from Gandhara, Pakistan, dating to the first or second century AD Doesn\u2019t really make for good propaganda Even if we leave aside how incredibly implausible this whole idea that Alexander somehow managed to pass off a total defeat as a total victory is, there is still another problem, which is that, quite frankly, the story as we have it does not exactly make the best pro-Alexander propaganda and it is not the kind of story we would expect Alexander to have made up if he were going to make a story up. The story as it has been passed down to us emphasizes Porus\u2019s courage and nobility. For instance, here is how Arrianos describes Porus\u2019s surrender in his Anabasis of Alexander book five, chapter eighteen, as translated by E. J. Chinnock: \u201cWhen Porus, who exhibited great talent in the battle, performing the deeds not only of a general but also of a valiant soldier, observed the slaughter of his cavalry, and some of his elephants lying dead, others destitute of keepers straying about in a forlorn condition, while most of his infantry had perished, he did not depart as Darius the Great King did, setting an example of flight to his men; but as long as any body of Indians remained compact in the battle, he kept up the struggle. But at last, having received a wound on the right shoulder, which part of his body alone was unprotected during the battle, he wheeled round.\u201d This is not the kind of portrayal we would expect Greek writers to give us if Alexander had actually been defeated by Porus. People generally only tend to acknowledge their enemies\u2019 courage after they have been defeated. So long as their enemies are still at large and still threats, people tend to emphasize their ferocity, their cruelty, and their barbarism. Being defeated by an enemy usually on exacerbates one\u2019s hatred towards them. If Alexander were really defeated by Porus, it does not make much sense why Greek writers looking to glorify Alexander would be so keen to emphasize Porus\u2019s own courage and nobility. The fact that the Greek writers portray Porus as brave and honorable, then, is an indication that Alexander either defeated Porus or at least made peace with him.  ABOVE: Fictional illustration from c. 1911 depicting Alexander\u2019s armies fighting the armies of King Porus in the Battle of the Hydaspes The \u201csofter\u201d version of the claim Some Indian and Pakistani nationalists, realizing how implausible it is to claim that Porus actually defeated Alexander in the Battle of the Hydaspes, have resorted to what you might call a \u201csofter\u201d version of this claim. There are people who acknowledge that Alexander won the Battle of Hydaspes, but insist that Porus ultimately won because Alexander\u2019s troops eventually mutinied at the Hyphasis River, forcing Alexander to return back west. Even this \u201csofter\u201d version of the story, though, does not hold up to scrutiny. Alexander conquered Porus\u2019s kingdom and continued further into India. While Alexander fought Porus on the banks of the Hydaspes River in around May 326 BC, his soldiers mutinied on the banks of the Hyphasis River in around July or August 326 BC\u2014after they had already marched all the way through Porus\u2019s kingdom. It is hard to claim that Porus \u201cwon\u201d when his entire kingdom was, in fact, conquered. Porus may have been permitted to rule his former kingdom as satrap, but he was nonetheless forced to become subservient to Alexander. Furthermore, even after the mutiny, Alexander did not just head straight back west; instead he headed south, conquering further lands as he went. The mutiny on the Hyphasis, then, did not mark a complete end to Alexander\u2019s conquests in the Indian subcontinent, although it did mark the furthest extent east that his armies ever reached. I think there is little doubt that the unexpected difficulties Alexander\u2019s army encountered in the Battle of the Hydaspes against Porus\u2019s army played an important role in their decision to mutiny. In particular, the Greeks were reportedly astonished by Porus\u2019s large number of war elephants. Nonetheless, the unexpected skill of Porus\u2019s army was far from the only reason why the troops mutinied. They had marched halfway across the known world and they were no doubt exhausted and homesick.  ABOVE: Map from Wikimedia Commons showing Alexander\u2019s conquests in Asia Conclusion We can never absolutely prove anything in history beyond any possible doubt. Nonetheless, there are some things we can be close to certain about. We must base our conclusions on the Law of Parsimony, which states that the conclusion that requires the least number of ad hoc assumptions is probably correct. All our surviving historical sources agree that Alexander won the Battle of the Hydaspes. We have no evidence that leads us to doubt the correctness of our sources in this regard and we actually have a great deal of evidence to support them. The most parsimonious conclusion, then, is that Alexander really won the battle. I am not saying this because I am secretly shilling for Alexander. I have already written on no uncertain terms about how disturbingly brutal Alexander could be. I am concluding that Alexander won the battle because that is where the historical evidence leads me. If there was good reason to question Alexander\u2019s victory, then I would question it, but, as matters stand, I am not aware of any good evidence to indicate that Alexander lost. Why? Just why? I have to admit I am really genuinely puzzled by how there are so many people who feel the need to make up an alternative history in which Alexander lost the Battle of the Hydaspes. First of all, it is perplexing to me why people care so much about whether or not one ruler of a small kingdom in northwest India won a single battle 2,345 years ago. I mean, come on, people, it\u2019s not like Porus\u2019s victory or defeat has any real present ramifications. Second of all, I am confused why people feel the need to make stuff up, since the real history here is already absolutely ripe for nationalist retellings. King Porus gave Alexander, the unstoppable conqueror and military mastermind who never lost a battle, the toughest battle of his life. He fought so hard that even his enemy was impressed and he was not only permitted to govern his former kingdom as a satrap, but the lands to the southwest as well. There is no way in which this story could possibly reflect poorly on Porus. Sure, he lost, but he was going up against Alexander the Great, whom no one else ever managed to defeat. Porus, at least, came the closest to defeating Alexander out of anyone.

            "answer_text": "This doesn't have a YES or NO answer as such. Let me just place the facts.  We are taught in our history textbooks that Alexander won, but the history we study has largely been written by the British who have distorted it to suit their whims, the most diabolical being the aryan invasion theory. Alexander might have actually lost and here's why.         For a long time, Megathenes's book Indica was the main source of info on India for the Europeans until Vasco da Gama set foot on the western shores. It is said that he makes no such claim or mention of India's invasion or any other such victory! What is more interesting is that Ptolemy's account too doesn't speak about it vehemently! Why would a victory if at all that was the case go unspoken of? Given India's stature during that time, such a victory would be the ultimate achievement of any conqueror! Such was the legend of India that even Napoleon considered conquering India as his penultimate goal once Europe was in his hands!! Let's take our historical accounts now. Indians are accused of having no sense of history! Far from the truth, India has the most august sense of history of all. Such comments only come from communists who call themselves as 'intellectuals ' and debunk anything that doesn't comply with their version as a fabrication and concoction. Having set that straight, we don't find the slightest mention of Alexander's invasion anywhere!! Some scholars go on to say that our ancestors have deliberately done so since it hurts their pride. However, that doesn't explain why Muslim conquerors are mentioned in texts like the Bhavishyat Purana. Certainly that isn't an Islamic text and they did far greater damage to our pride than what Alexander could have ever done!! This can only mean one thing. Either Alexander's invasion was just another insignificant battle in the northwest which was routinely being attacked by the Huns, Persians and hence did not deserve to be mentioned OR perhaps he never invaded. But since he did invade, and that is beyond all doubt, the former is a logical conclusion.  Regarding his victory over Porous, that too is doubtful. Some versions say that he suffered his first defeat at the hands of Porous and the British rewrote it to save their false pride. This is very much possible. First of all the terrain was completely different to what Alexander was used to. While he had fought in open battlefields and plains, this time he had to go through forests and face guerilla warriors - the first of its kind in his experience. Besides elephants were faced by him for the first time and in the tropical backdrop proved lethal. The Persians some say also used them, but they never had the topology good enough to exploit them to the fullest extent. Thus in all probability, it might have proven to be just too many odds against one man - terrain, tactics and not to mention the psychology of his army stretched by war incessant.  On the other hand, there is another version which says that he won, but with a heavy price paid. Further info regarding the armies in the interior parts of India convinced him that any more forward marches would mean certain death and the sheer resistance put up by Parvateshvar  (Porous) had literally demoralised his army which was used to victories. He himself was badly injured in the battle and his horse Becaphalus had been killed.  I shall not refute this version for it has a few merits. Most importantly, despite the challenges that I mentioned previously that faced Alexander, Porous was a petty king with a small army and few resources. And numbers do count for victory. May not be as much as strategy, but certainly play a part. Besides Alexander never arrived for battle with a blank page with Porous. He was assisted by the prince of Taxila who had scores to settle with Porous. This was one of the incidents that infuriated Chanakya and what happened next is history. Hence, Alexander might just have amassed enough strength to score a marginal victory over our king.  As I mentioned previously, it's tough to say for certain what happened. I have presented two versions which seem equally probable. We might never know the truth for sure since historical accounts are altered down the ages for a variety of reasons. ",
