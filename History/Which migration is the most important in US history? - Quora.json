These trails of tears had the effect of opening up that land to white migrants, and spurned another equally abhorrent migration, that of enslaved African Americans, torn away from their families to plant and harvest cotton in the newly vacated territory. These migrations had a great impact on how the U.S. would develop, to include the sectional strife that nearly tore it apart. ",
