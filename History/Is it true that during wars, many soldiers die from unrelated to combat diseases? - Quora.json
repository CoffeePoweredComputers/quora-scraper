            "answer_text": "In World 1 the flu was deadly as troops lived in filthy trenches full of piss,shit and huge rats! Both sides hid the effects as the horrid war went on! In the cival war; more soldiers died of flu,syphliss and gonereria than those on the battlefield. This is not to count infection. The crummy hospitals were a horrific place as all wished to die; but with no way to do so! Gonnerria was treated by sticking a long needle thru the penis end and then down with medicine as the patient screamed in pain while tied down. This was done weekly along with the syphliss patients! Many flu patients were left to die while seperated from the other screaming men. This is not to mention the human limbs cut-off with no pain-killers at all! Such would have been a screaming horror zone!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. In many cases, it was even worse than the casualties inflicted by the enemy. That was the case during the French invasion of Madagascar (5756 from disease, 25 during combats). There are lots of examples, from ancient history to modern times. Even in WW2, many Japanese or Chinese soldiers died from dysentery, due to promiscuity and a lack of hygiene. And I'm not even talking about prisoners of war. But were these diseases really unrelated to combat? That's a tough question. In fact the most important part of strategy is not to destroy the enemies in a hazardous battle, but to put they into an unsustainable situation, by cutting their supply lines, poisoning wells with corpses and the like. During the siege of Caffa in 1346, the Mongols used infected corpses to spread the black plague in the Genovese city (which eventually killed around 1/3 of the European population). A very common outcome was the destruction of a retreating army, under bad weather and without enough food. Nothing could stop an epidemic under such circumstances. ",
