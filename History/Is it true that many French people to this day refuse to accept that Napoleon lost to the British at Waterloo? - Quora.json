            "answer_text": " The whole world, with the exception of UK perhaps,refute the view that Napoleon lost to the British at Waterloo. He lost to the Coalition forces, or more precisely, to the Anglo-Prussian army. Troop strength:- Napoleon 73,000. Wellesley 68,000. Blucher 50,000. Before Blucher led the Prussians into the battlefield, Napoleon had used his meager numerical advantage to great effect. He had control over two out of three nodal points of the battlefield-La Haye Sainte in the centre, and Planceloit on the right. Hougomont on the left stayed in British hands, but the French kept them besieged, unable to come in aid of the Centre if needed. Arthur Wellesley\u2019s centre had collapsed, his cavalry was spent, and with the loss of La Haye Sainte, the French were now only 60 yards away. Napoleon could have slowly tightened his grip at this point. By using his artillery from La Haye Sainte, he could have further diminished enemy forces, and then brought the Imperial Guards into play. In short, the hammer was about to fall.Napoleon was about to deal the crucial blow. Instead,what happened was Blucher arrived and captured the vital position of Planceloit.And Napoleon had to keep sending more and more men to his right flank. The condition suddenly became critical for him instead. This was a complete reversal of fortune. To avoid a Prussian-English double envelopment or a pincer move, he had to drive away one of them immediately. So, he threw his reserve, the Guards, at the more vulnerable and exhausted enemy- the British army. Wellesley now performed his sole act of brilliance. He had hidden his \u201cGrasshopper\u201d division in \u201creverse slopes\u201d, and ordered them to shoot the guards at a point blank range. When the dust settled and the French were routed, Blucher met up with Wellesley and summarised the battle as \u2018Quelle Affaire'. In the end, neither army defeated Napoleon alone, but the timely arrival of Blucher saved the day for the British. Wellesley was quite generous in admitting the role of the Prussians. But the British propaganda machinery, slowly and very carefully, started documenting Waterloo as a story of British victory. Fictional quotes like \u201cThe battle of Waterloo was won at the playground of Eton\u201d appeared and were widely publicized. Perhaps, that\u2019s why more people hear about Waterloo than Leipzig or Austerlitz. Especially with the dissolution of Prussia in 1947, there are few who\u2019d care to preserve the legacy of Prussian valour at Waterloo.  (Curiously, it continues to this day. Inspite of Zidane being one of the greatest footballers of all time, Beckham is a more recognisable figure. ) ",

            "answer_text": "Before we begin, my answer is most likely not. I am not French myself, but to say that Napoleon had not lost the battle on the 18th of June, 1815, would be a fools\u2019 remark. To realize how heavy of a loss Waterloo truly took to be won, read below, and by the end, you will know for yourself if it was a French, or British victory. Many people do not realize how much of a bloody mess Waterloo really held. Out of over 200,000 men engaged, 45,000 casualties occurred. The number 45,000 is the number of deaths of a war, not a single battle. The Battle Of Waterloo was a day that should be honoured in history, and should be remembered by all people - British and French, on how many lives were lost that 10 hours of living hell. Napoleon took The Battle Of Waterloo as a final stand, realizing any other way of France marching forwards was near to impossible. Everything the young general did in his military command, would be decided here, on this ground. Risen early at dawn, old songs about war and love echoed through the lone, empty battlefield, to be replaced by drums and fifes of war. At 4 am, June 18th, 1815, the troops took one last look at their countries flying colours, and marched onwards towards their enemies of 1000 years; France and Britain collided, for the final time.  After returning from Paris, Napoleon gathered a 300,000 man strong force of French soldiers and militia, all very all loyal and trained with the emperor. Out of all 300,000 men gathered, a third of that force was taken, to be numbered at 70,000 men which was split into three parts; with Napoleon, Marshall Ney, and Marshal Grouchy. Marshall Grouchy commanded as well several cavalry, although most of the Lancers and elite riders of France were handed to Ney. Marshall Grouchy\u2019s main were the many ground troops, such as regular infantry. Marshall Ney commanded most of the cavalry, as while Napoleon commanded his favourite regiments: The Grenadiers and Guards.  ( Above: The Battle Of Waterloo, 1815)  (The Old Guard of France) Napoleon realized, after scouting that Wellington was gaining support from Prussian forces, under the command of General Blucher. Napoleon\u2019s original plan of defense was to split the Prussian and British forces away from each other, for sheer force up against was an impossible task, he was outnumbered 2\u20131. Wellington had a staggering force of 65,000 men, who were inexperienced and not as loyal as Napoleon\u2019s veterans. The Prussians were heavy with cavalry, at 58,000 numbers, along with many other allies with artillery, support infantry, skirmishers, and small numbers of elite cavalry.  \u201cWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Bl\u00fccher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Bl\u00fccher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Bl\u00fccher's chief of staff, August Neidhardt von Gneisenau, had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Bl\u00fccher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Bl\u00fccher, promising to support him with three corps. [38]From 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under B\u00fclow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and B\u00fclow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88 artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along B\u00fclow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. B\u00fclow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps. [39]Napoleon breakfasted off silver plate at Le Caillou, the house where he had spent the night. When Soult suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast\". [40]Napoleon's seemingly dismissive remark may have been strategic, given his maxim \"in war, morale is everything\". He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals. [41]Later on, being told by his brother, Jerome, of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy. [42]Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at Le Caillou had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Bl\u00fccher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.\u201d-Quoting Wikipedia, none of the above said text is my own workThe Battle was ready. Napoleon concentrated his first artillery fire on the left and right flanks of Wellington\u2019s troops, and attempted to separate them from the Prussian troops. This was the first move of the battle.  Important parts of the battle: -At 3:00 pm, Marshall Ney\u2019s attack on La Haye Sainte wasted all 8000 cavalry troops under his command. Wellington\u2019s infantry squares crushed Ney\u2019s unsupported forces, all to the fall of the French forces. (On the mapped battle above, this occurs at around the 2:10 mark)  (Above: Marshall Neys infamously failed French cavalry charge against British lines) Wellington\u2019s lines were unexpectedly holding steady against several flanked attacks. Napoleon decided on something he had never done before - Use the Guard for assault. -At 7:00 pm, Napoleon\u2019s favoured Old Guard is ordered to follow him North to Brussels Road to crush Wellington\u2019s holding line. The Guard split into two flanks and advanced towards Hougoumont, and the rest at march to Mont Saint Jean. Wellington\u2019s troops of infantry realized the immortals by their unique bearskin hats and elegant uniforms, and opened fire with deadly canister and suppressed shots. The line held steady still, unwavering and continued to march, without fear or doubt on the soldiers\u2019 faces. Wellington gave the final command after several minutes of massacre, and to be remembered as three commands that broke the French that day; \u201cRise, Guards! Now is your time! (In the clip below, Wellington says; Rise, Maitland!: Who was the commander of the Foot Guards) Make Ready! Fire!\u201d (Below: Napoleon\u2019s Old Guard retreats after Maitland\u2019s Foot Guards fire)  Maitland\u2019s Foot Guards matched the Old Guard and routed them for this first time in all of Napoleon\u2019s campaigns. At their retreat, the Foot Guards charged down the hill and Mont Saint Jean, and butchered them with bayonets, finishing the most elite of France off. \u201cLa Garde Recule!\u201d Cried the onlooking infantry. At this moment Napoleon knew the battle was done for him. The battle ended several hours later, to leave more than 20,000 dead men and horses on the battlefield. To say French people would not remember the sacrifice and losses on that day would be foolish, because they were many.
