            "answer_text": "If Japan and Germany had not invaded their neighboring countries, more people would have died in the coming conflicts between other super power countries.  Wars between nations would be frequent and everyday common affairs. United Nations would not exist to prevent any of the wars. The US would not be the top super power country and would have little influence over world affairs. All of Europe would never have united to create the Euro, and fighting would continue to this day.  First, Nazi Germany would enslave Africa to mine minerals like silver and gold (see Wikipedia on the intent of WWII's Nazi North African Campaign). Hitler creates a plan to also control almost all the oil in the world. Nazi Germany creates a treaty with most of the oil rich Middle East nations to make oil trade in German Reichsmark or Germany's currency at that time. Most of the Middle East (Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan) eagerly join Nazi Germany to combine their efforts in wiping out the Jews from their country. In return for the petro-Reichsmark currency agreement, Nazi Germany provides the Middle East Reich Allies advanced war weapons to crush Saudi Arabia and overthrow the Saudi King, a staunch US ally.  The word \"genocide\" would not be in our vocabulary and all the Jews would be slowly and systematically killed in Europe and in the Middle East due to the Nazi's powerful economic might and political influence.  Next, Nazi Germany reaches out to Russia and China to form a Triumvirate Regime, promising to promote Communism and Socialism, and use Capitalism as a scapegoat for the source of the world's social unrest and chasm between the rich and poor. Nazi Germany eventually develops the technology to rapidly build nuclear bombs, and provides Russia and China advanced weapons and nuclear bombs to conquer neighboring countries. British India is invaded by China in a war that ends up in India loosing. India and China unite; India is absorbed into China. Japan never invaded China because there was no WWII, and the table would turn as China would eventually invade Japan and all the surrounding islands that Imperial Japan would have taken in WWII.  The US breaks apart leaving behind just a few self governed states. Instead of the Cold War, it would be a Hot War between the US and Russia, with Russia receiving advanced weapons and financial backing from Nazi Germany. The US is invaded by Communist Russia, similar to the 1984 movie \"Red Dawn.\" Nazi Germany assists Russia's invasion by sending a nuclear armed submarine on a suicide mission to go under water, undetected into the Potomac River to Washington D.C. The detonation of the nuclear bomb destroys the US capital and creates anarchy. A few states rise up from the ashes of war to become self governed, but never become united like it was before. The African American Civil Rights Movement would have never occurred because there was no WWII to give blacks a chance to prove their bravery, patriotism, and equals in the battlefield to the whites; no black war heroes to be honored. WWII was necessary to save more lives for future generations. Nazi Germany due to their expansionist policy had to create new and advanced war weapons. One of their field of research was on the atomic bomb, their top secret and most devastating war weapon. German scientists had already figured out how to make such a weapon but had tricked Hitler to believe it wasn't ready; they didn't want such a weapon to fall into the wrong hands. Once the Nazis lost the war, the US quickly implemented operation Paper Clip to confiscate all the atomic research and recruit all German scientists before the Russians could get them. With help from the German scientists, the US created the two atomic bombs that helped shorten the war with Japan; detonating the bombs on the country of Japan showed the rest of the world the horrific affects of the devastating weapon. Naturally, any country that want to remain a super power had to also get the ability to make these bombs. Today, all the super powers do not invade one another because everyone has the ability to retaliate with their own nuclear bombs. To set off just one modern day nuclear bomb with 1000 times more power than the ones set off on Hiroshima and Nagasaki would annihilate half the hemisphere of Earth due to years of nuclear winters, crop failures, food shortages, water contamination, countless health problems, and environmental devastation. We are in a period of truce between all the super power countries because of the invention: the nuclear bomb. Germany's Nazis and Hitler, Japan's Imperialism, and WWII had actually saved more lives in the future. The first computer was also invented during WWII by the English math professor, Alan Turing, who helped solve and broke Germany's Enigma code. Historians agreed that Turing's computer shortened the war by at least a few years. You can learn some of this by watching the movie \"The Imitation Game.\"  WWII was the main impetus for Turing's funding to build the first computer (there was no Google back then for funding). We have modern computers and the internet due to the great advancements accomplished during WWII. How many lives were saved by all the hospitals' MRI computers and countless computers in other medical applications? We're still saving lives today and making life better with computers. ",

            "answer_text": "To be sure of avoiding WWII, you would have had to have WWI end differently. The Versailles and other peace treaties sewed the seeds of WWII, so those are what would have had to change. Germany would have had to have been treated a lot better, and Japan a little better, to have removed the causes that led to them becoming the primary belligerents. Not carving the Polish Corridor and Danzig out of Germany would have gone far, restoring the German colonies would have gone farther, and eliminating the reparations would have gone the rest of the way. Essentially we are talking about a status quo antebellum as the settlement in Europe. That would have been a pretty bitter pill for Britain and France to swallow, but it is the only one that would have assured their long term peace and security. It could have been done, but it certainly would have required Wilson to get off of his excessively idealistic high horse. As for Japan, they would have had to have been treated a little better (which would have required Europeans and Americans to have been a lot less racist and arrogant), and they would have had to get something more than they did - German New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, for example. Even with all this, I\u2019m not sure that would have left Germany and Japan satisfied. They were rising powers and wanted to expand their empires, and this would have been true under any of a number of different leaders. Britain, France, and the US were status quo powers, and it would be very hard to find a way that would accommodate the rising powers and the status quo powers. The one big piece on the global chessboard that could have been in play would have been the Soviet Union. It was not just Hitler that wanted Soviet territory, this had been discussed widely in Germany long before him. The Japanese had already fought one successful war against Russia and acquired some territory from them; they would have liked to have acquired even more. Thus, even without a Hitler, it is not inconceivable that at some point Germany and Japan could have formed an alliance directed just against the USSR. This would have been fine with the British, French, and Americans, who all detested the \u201cBolsheviks\u201d. Thus, there might still have been a big war, but just between Germany and Japan on the one side and the USSR on the other, with Britain, France, and the US sitting neutral. I don\u2019t see how the USSR would have won a two-front war with no allies. On the other hand, a Germany without Hitler might have also had less extreme war aims, and so the USSR might have survived with only a loss of some peripheral territory. The Sino-Japanese war would have likely still happened, and the US might have been inclined to supply the Chinese and embargo the Japanese. However, with the Japanese attacking North rather than South, and with neutral Britain, France, and Netherlands likely more favorably disposed to help out the Japanese when they were attacking the USSR, it is likely that the Japanese would have gotten the oil and other resources that they needed from East Asia without having to resort to war. The US and Japan would thus have faced off against each other in an armed, hostile, and wary stalemate, but would not have gone to war. Without going through a horrific WWII and becoming so dependent upon the US, it is likely that Britain and France (and also the Netherlands, Belgium, etc.) would have felt less pressure to free their colonies, and would have had less of an economic imperative to do so. Thus, the breakup of the great European empires would have happened much more slowly than it did. What would the world have thus looked like? Europe would have looked a lot like it did in 1913, except that a big chunk of the Westernmost part of the Russian Empire would have become German territory. In Asia and the Pacific, the Japanese Empire would look like it did in 1939, with the addition of Northern New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, the Northern half of Sakhalin, and maybe much of the Soviet Far East. Most of the imperial possessions of Britain, France, Netherlands, etc. would have remained so for decades more. ",
