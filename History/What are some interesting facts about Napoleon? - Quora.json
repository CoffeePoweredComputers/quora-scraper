            "answer_text": "Thanks for the interesting question. I decided to answer it and looked through a lot of information and documents. This is what seemed interesting to you for your attention. Napoleon became famous not only due to his intelligence and leadership talent, but also due to incredible ambitions, as well as a quick career. He began military service at 16, at 24 he already became a general, and at 34 emperor. Napoleon was the first Corsican to successfully graduate from the French Military Academy. Napoleon spent very little time sleeping - about 4 hours a day.  Napoleon, a young junior lieutenant of French artillery, in 1785 filed a petition for enrollment in the Russian imperial army. Napoleon hoped to earn enough money. But an order was issued by the Russian government that foreign officers enlisted in the Russian imperial army would receive a military rank one notch lower than that in which they had served in the former service. Napoleon did not want a demotion in rank. Napoleon obtained a personal audience with Lieutenant General Ivan Zaborovsky, who led the special commission for the recruitment of volunteers. But the meeting with the general of the Russian army did not bring the desired result. General Zaborovsky could not understand why he should make an exception for some young and unknown to anyone artillery junior lieutenant who had just recently begun his army service. And Napoleon refused to serve in Russia. Napoleon once, watched the play \"Oedipus\" with the Russian Emperor Alexander I, Napoleon went to sleep. Napoleon see dream of a huge Russian bear tearing Napoleon's chest and devouring the insides. Years later, Napoleon recalled this. Napoleon was shy of his growth and physique. As a result, at his headquarters all the officers were little growth, and tall and slender had no chance of making a career. Napoleon read very quickly at a speed of two thousand words per minute. Napoleon had a wonderful memory; he remembered thousands of soldiers by name. Napoleon created buttons on the sleeves of man jacket. Napoleon did this in order to wean his soldiers to wipe their noses with the edge of their outer clothing.  Napoleon was exiled to the Island of St Helena. Napoleon never went anywhere without copious amounts of his favorite brandy; Courvoisier Cognac. It\u2019s said that the British sailors on the ships were heard to exclaim, \u201cIt\u2019s the brandy of Napoleon Napoleon name is brand a Cognac.  Napoleon cake was named after the Napoleon. Napoleon cake - flaky, crumbly and creamy all at once, the French dessert the millefeuille \u2014 which translates as \u201ca thousand leaves\u201d.  In Egypt, Napoleon was so frightened of the sight of the ancient Sphinx that he ordered to shoot at him from cannons. Therefore, the nose of the Sphinx was beaten off - the cannonball blew it off.  Napoleon liked hats - in his personal collection there were more than two hundred. You must have heard that Napoleon was afraid of cats. This is actually a lie. This is his nephew, Napoleon III, suffered from ailurophobia, and not at all the great emperor. During his exile on St. Helena, Napoleon picked up a kitten, whom named Ben. Ben and Napoleon were inseparable and spent a lot of time together. Thus, one of the greatest conquerors in history was a true cat lover.  The name of the cat breed is called Napoleon. The breed was created in 1995. Cats of the Napoleon breed are animals with a surprisingly cute appearance and friendly character, extremely gentle and affectionate. The main feature of the breed is the surprisingly cute expression of the muzzle, its rounded shapes and large large eyes. The latter make even adult animals very similar to kittens. Therefore, both children and adults adore the Napoleons. During the reign of Napoleon, there were reforms that affected all spheres of French life - from education to taxation, and which are still the basis of modern France.  Napoleon's favorite horse was the Arabian stallion Marengo. Throughout the military career, Napoleon changed 130 horses. Napoleon was a good mathematician. the name Napoleon belongs to a theorem, the proof of which is attributed to Napoleon. Napoleon proposed a simple and convenient way to build a square. For his merits in mathematics, he was elected an academician of the French Academy of Sciences of that time. Napoleon loved the theater, especially Romeo and Juliet, Napoleon never applauded. The audience also did not applaud, remaining in solidarity with Napoleon, so there was always silence in the theater. One of Napoleon\u2019s many drinking cup was made from the skull of the famous Italian adventurer Count Cagliostro.  Napoleon is considered the creator of the modern flag of Italy. In 1805, he proclaimed the name: Kingdom of Italy instead of the Cisalpine Republic, he declared himself the Italian king and approved the green-white-red flag of Italy Napoleon believed in night dreams. Napoleon sometimes fell asleep very quickly and saw dreams. On the evening of December 24, 1800, an attempt was made on the assassination of Napoleon. Napoleon had to go for an evening at the Opera. When Napoleon got into the carriage, he fell asleep. Napoleon\u2019s night dream: he was drowning in the Italian river Tagliamento, at that moment Napoleon woke up from explosion. The salvation was that then Napoleon was not riding in his carriage.  There are interesting facts about parallels in the fate of Napoleon and Hitler: - Napoleon was born in 1760. Hitler was born in 1889 (the difference is 129 years). - Napoleon came to power in 1804, and Hitler in 1933 (a difference of 129 years) - Napoleon entered Vienna in 1812, Hitler - 1941 (the difference is 129 years); - Napoleon lost the war in 1816, Hitler in 1945 (the difference is 129 years) Both of these conquerors came to power when they were 44 age. Both attacked Russia at 52. Both lost the war at age 56. Napoleon is the author of the romantic novel \"Clisson et Eugnie.\" After the defeat of Napoleon\u2019s army in Russia, Kutuzov, in an order on the army, congratulated the troops on expelling the enemy from Russia and urged them to \u201ccomplete the defeat of the enemy in his own fields.\" In Russian history, these military operations of 1813-1814 are known as the \u201cForeign Campaign of the Russian Army\u201d. At the beginning of 1813, only Russia waged a war against Napoleon in central Europe. In March 1813, Prussia entered the coalition, then in the summer of 1813 England, Austria and Sweden joined. In February 1814, Napoleon had the opportunity to end the war in peace. Emperor of Russia Alexander I proposed ending the war, subject to France returning to the borders of 1792. Napoleon rejected this offer, and the war continued. 1814 is an assault on Paris on March 18-19. The 45 thousand French defending the capital were opposed by about 100,000 coalition soldiers, of which 63 thousand were Russian.  1812 The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries is an 1812 painting by Jacques-Louis David. It shows French Emperor Napoleon I in uniform in his study at the Tuileries Palace.Napoleon wanted in 1808 married to the sister of Emperor of Russia Alexander I, Grand Duchess Catherine, and was refused: Catherine was already engaged. Two years later, Napoleon repeats the attempt - now Napoleon wanted is getting married to the 14-year-old Grand Duchess Princess Anne. And they refuse him again Napoleon studied Russia well. Beginning in 1810, artists, travelers, monks, and merchants came to Russia, all of them kept diaries and records about the country of Russia. The French, who served in Russian families \u2014 doctors, tutors, teachers, and servants \u2014 were forced to report. The Polish intelligence officers, as well. Napoleon three times during the war of 1812 tried to \"persuade\" the Russian emperor to make peace. During the invasion of Moscow. On September 18, through Major General Ivan Tutolmin, Napoleon announced that he respected the emperor Alexander and wished to make peace with him. Two days later, Napoleon sends a letter to the Russian emperor, which is transmitted by the father of the Russian writer Herzen. Emperor Alexander ignores both the two letter. October 4, Napoleon sends a message to Kutuzov in Tarutino for the Russian emperor with a proposal for peace. Napoleon writes: \"I need peace.\" Emperor Alexander leaves the letter unanswered. Napoleon did not have direct descendants. So modern Bonapartes are just the descendants of his sisters and brothers. Matilda - Napoleon's niece, daughter of his younger brother in 1840 married the richest Russian industrialist Anatoly Demidov. The emperor of Russia, Nikolai I, gave permission to marry. Matilda and her family were poor and Demidov began to pay an annual pension to all members of the Bonaparte family. It is interesting that Matilda began to divorce Demidov after taking possession of his diamonds. Divorce was controlled by two emperors Napoleon 3 and Nicholas 1. Sympathy of the emperors was on the side of Matilda and the court sentenced Demidov to pay large compensation to Bonaparte. Granddaughter of Lucien Bonaparte, Princess Marie married in 1907 very successfully: for Count George Korfsky, a relative of the Russian emperors Romanovs.  Charles Napoleon BonaparteNow in the world live about 280 Bonapartes. One of the most notable is Charles Napoleon Bonaparte. Charles Napoleon became a doctor of economic sciences and a financier, at one time he served as vice mayor of the Corsican city of Ajaccio - the historical homeland of the family. He is passionate about family history and some time ago he published the book \"Unknown Napoleon - My Ancestor.\"  \"On the highway. Retreat ...\" Vasily Vereshchagin Painting, 1890Interestingly, the battle of Napoleon and the Russian army on the Berezina is recognized as a draw. Interestingly, Russian historians saw it as a defeat. We look at the facts. The military historian Clausewitz estimated the loss of the French soldiers killed and captured at 21 thousand people, another 10 thousand drowned and froze during the crossing or deserted. Kutuzov in the report to the imperor called the figure of 29 thousand people. 13 generals were killed and wounded. French soldiers to drop almost all the artillery and carts. According to General Chichagov, an officer of the Russian headquarters, the French managed to save about 30 of the 40 thousand wounded and civilians. Russian losses amounted to about six thousand. Interestingly, the French army could be completely defeated in the battle of Berezina. But the army of Kutuzov went very slowly and did not have time to battle. Many believe that Kutuzov deliberately delayed the advance of his army so that Chichagov, who led the battle in the battle on the Berezina, did not defeat Napoleon's army. It is interesting that in the battle of Berezin, many Russian officers and soldiers were handed out leaflets with a portrait and signs of Napoleon. It was assumed that it would be possible to capture Napoleon. The temperature at the time when Napoleon captured Moscow was only three degrees below zero Fahrenheit. When Napoleon left Moscow, which he burned, early and very severe frosts began. The temperature dropped to -25 The battle of Maloyaroslavets \u201cburied\u201d Napoleon\u2019s army! It was after the battle for Maloyaroslavets that Napoleon ordered the manufacture of poison, which he began to carry with him. During the day, 25 thousand Russians and French participated in the battle for the city. In the evening, Napoleon himself took command in his hands, with up to 70 thousand combat-ready troops at his disposal. About 16 hours with the main Russian forces appeared Kutuzov, with an army of up to 90 thousand. From a formal point of view, the French won the battle for Maloyaroslavets: the city remained behind them, and their losses amounted to up to 6 thousand against 7 thousand for Russians. Napoleon did not create a new big battle but continued his retreat.  In 1797, Napoleon Bonaparte made an excellent advertisement for his currency and country: he circulated the news that a bank check for a million francs bearer was allegedly sealed in one of the 5-franc coins .... A French bank today guarantees payment of the specified amount, but the check has not yet been presented. It is interesting when the Russian troops entered Paris and the Russians needed Russian baths. The device of Russian baths caused a number of difficulties for the French authorities. This is surprising, because Russians paid generously for the construction of Russian baths. These baths surprised the inhabitants of Paris, in particular, the Russian habit of plunging into cold ice water immediately upon leaving the bathhouse. The Russian bath seemed to the French ordinary people something strange, outlandish. Levenstern writes: \"A Russian soldier is more likely to do without a bed than without a Russian bath.\" And adds: \"Unlike the French soldier, who primarily seeks to shine with his appearance and is very rarely washed.\"  Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-PierreBonaparte has always held deep respect for science and people. He demanded respect for science and others. Once Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, a famous writer whose talent Napoleon highly valued, complain to Bonaparte that the Institute treats him without respect. Napoleon thought for a moment. \u201cTell me,\u201d he asked after a short pause, \u201care you familiar with differential calculus?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d The writer admitted sincerely. \u201cSo what are you complaining about!\u201d One of the officials delivered Napoleon a libel to the emperor Napoleon and demanded punishment for the culprit of the creator of this libel. Napoleon said the punishment should not be the author of the libel, but the libel-delivering official who dared to see the image of the emperor there. This is reality about the responsibility for reposting on the Internet right now.  Napoleon liked the Breguet watch. Napoleon considered Breguet the best. In 1798, Napoleon bought his first Breguet watch with a fight, a Breguet travel watch with a calendar and a Breguet automatic watch with a repeater, and soon the closest circle and family of the future emperor of France became adherents of the Breguet brand. Napoleon learned about Breguet from acquaintances: General Charles Leclerc, military commander Louis Alexander Berthier and statesman Jean-Joseph Dessol, who at that time had already appreciated Breguet, told him about the skilled watchmaker Breguet. The Patriotic War of 1812 was not the first confrontation between Kutuzov and Napoleon. The two commanders had already collided in 1805. Interestingly, the Braille font for the blind was based on the \"night alphabet\" that Napoleon\u2019s army used to read reports in the dark  Painting \"Napoleon in Burning Moscow\". Germany, 1841 Albrecht AdamIn 1812, when Napoleon captured Moscow and wanted to drive through this majestic Spassky Gate. Spassky Gate was a mystical construction and, passing through them, all Russians traditionally took off their hats. Napoleon decided to pass the Spassky Gate of the Russian Kremlin without removing his cocked hat. And Napoleon's hat blew off the wind from his head. everyone appreciated it as a bad sign In the period from 1802 to 1805 Napoleon created a single army, with a strength of approximately 350 thousand people (by 1812 the total number was about 1 million people with all the auxiliary and secondary units). Each of the links in this single military mechanism had clearly defined tasks and functions. To invade Russia, Napoleon created a significant army of 678 thousand soldiers. These were perfectly armed and trained troops, hardened in previous wars. In the army of Napoleon there were soldiers of the countries and territories occupied by him. At the initial stage of the war, the French army was numerically superior to the Russian. The first echelon of the French troops, which entered the borders of Russia, totaled 450 thousand people, while the Russians were about 320 thousand people, divided into three armies at a great distance from each other.  Painting \"Napoleon at the Borodino Heights.\" Vereshchagin, 1897Battle of Borodino. Kutuzov chose defensive tactics and, in accordance with this, deployed his troops, Napoleon adhered to offensive tactics. Napoleon intended to break through the defenses of the Russian army on the flanks, surround it and finally defeat it.  Painting \"Attack on the Raevsky battery.\" Alexander Averyanov, 2005.The battle of Borodino, which lasted more than 12 hours. The losses on both sides were huge. Borodino was a moral victory for the Russians: the combat potential of the Russian army was preserved, Napoleonic - significantly weakened. It is interesting that both the Russians and the French believe that it was their victory. The Russians decided to leave Moscow and Napoleon read this victory. Interesting fact. Old General Likhachev was retired, but during the French invasion of Russia, he returned to the army and immediately went to the front. During the battle of Borodino, the Likhachev division defended the Rayevsky battery. In the battle, Likhachev was wounded several times and was captured. The seriously wounded Likhachev was taken to Napoleon; Emperor Napoleon, admired by the courage of the Russian general, returned the saber to him and offered to let him go, but Peter Likhachev refused to accept weapons from the enemy, saying: \u201cCaptivity deprived me of the saber granted to me by my sovereign and from him only I can take her back. \" Napoleon ordered the disobedient general to be sent to France; in December 1812, Russian troops liberated him. But during the invasion of Russia, Napoleon\u2019s army numbered 678 thousand soldiers, while only 15 thousand Napoleonic soldiers were able to escape. The entire \"Great Army\" remained lying on the road from Moscow to Vilna.  Museum-Panorama \"Battle of Borodino\" - a historical museum in Moscow dedicated to the Patriotic War of 1812 Address: Kutuzovsky prospekt, 38, bld. 1, Moscow, Russia  One of the most valuable exhibits of the exhibition is the saber of Napoleon, which was transferred to Count Pavel Shuvalov, who saved Napoleon from the hands of French peasants near Fontainebleau I hope you were interested in these stories. But I chose to my taste. I am a Jew who was born in Germany and raised in the USSR and Russia. When I was a schoolboy we went on an excursion to Borodino and visited the museum. It is very interesting. There is also a wonderful film by Sergei Bondarchuk \"War and Peace\" 1965 is based on the famous novel by the Russian writer Count Tolstoy. ",
