            "answer_text": "Every single expert in history has the same answer: Rocky Marciano was by far the best conditioned heavyweight, and likely best conditioned fighter at any class, of all time.  CREDIT PICTURE WALL STREET JOURNAL Rocky lived, breathed, and ate training and conditioning, year around, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for eight years. Dan Cuoco of the International Boxing Research Organisation put it best: \u201cNo fighter ever approached training and conditioning with the same fanticism Rocky did. Even when he wasn\u2019t in camp training for a fight, his conditioning and training routines were more than any other fighter did in camp.\u201d Rocky\u2019s conditioning was simply a level above anyone else\u2019s, ever Rocky was a relentless, highly conditioned, extremely powerful fighter who depended on an iron chin, his conditioning, to keep him firing away as well in the 15th as he was in the first, enormous strength, and a right hand which was as good a punch as boxing has ever seen. Budd Schulberg, award-winning screenwriter and boxing fanatic, correlated Marciano\u2019s capability of grinding down an opponent to a: \u201chydraulic drill attacking a boulder.\u201d Arthur Daley exalted him as a: \u201cperpetual motion punching machine.\u201d Rocky was a fanatic and dedicated trainee. Marciano\u2019s boundless reserves of stamina explained his overpoweringly swarming style and his remarkable recuperative powers meant he was seldom troubled with any sort of fatigue. Dan Cuoco of the International Boxing Research Organisation explained Marciano's success thusly: \u201cWhat Rocky Marciano gave up in height and reach he more than made up with one punch knockout power, extraordinary strength and stamina, an insatiable will to win, mental toughness and plenty of guts\u2026Although he missed a lot his savage body attack would wear his opponents down. What he lacked in speed, he more than made up for by the volume of punches he threw. When he was caught with a good punch, his world class chin held up admirably.\u201d Rocky's trainer, the highly respected Charley Goldman, originally just laughed at the challenge facing him. But after a number of years of working with the dedicated Rocky he remarked: \u201cI got a guy who is short, stoop-shouldered and balding with two left feet, (Rocky\u2019s victims) all look better than he does as far as moves are concerned, but they don\u2019t look so good (laying) on the canvas.\u201d Rocky at 5'10 1/2\" with the shortest reach of any champion, would almost always be undersized in comparisons with other champions, historically. But he is actually a half inch taller than Mike Tyson, though his reach was 3 inches shorter. Still, heart, toughness, relentless motor, unmatched conditioning, desire, all have to count - Rocky had one style, and one motor. He went after his opponent, as Ali once said: \u201che was the toughest, most determined fighter I ever saw. He was tougher than Joe Frazier, and I didn\u2019 t think that was possible!\" Rocky was a man with an inhuman will, and desire to win, that fueled his fanatic training Cus D\u2019Amato, Mike Tyson\u2019s surrogate father and the man who molded him into the youngest world heavyweight champion, was asked once to explain how a small heavyweight like Rocky could be so dominant. He replied: \u201cWhen men of near equal skill meet- the man with the superior \"will to win\" -will win every time, unless the man's skill is so far above that of his opponent that his will is not tested\u2026Rocky had that superior will to win.\u201d Pulitzer Prize winner Red Smith said of Rocky: \u201cRocky couldn't box like [Gene] Tunney, and probably couldn't hit like [Joe] Louis, but in one respect he had no challenger. He was the toughest, strongest, most completely dedicated fighter who ever wore gloves. Fear wasn't in his vocabulary and pain had no meaning.\" His training regamin was inhuman Rocky Marciano is an example of old fashioned training, which was far more intense than the \u201cscience based training \u201c of today. Charlie Goldman told Rocky from his first day with him: you know you\u2019re a short, bald, fat guy. You ain\u2019t got a lot of speed. Are you willing to put in the hours, and days, and months, and years, to bring what you do got to the top?\u201d And Marciano did. In between fights he trained harder than 99% of fighters do in fight camp In between fights, in the normal course of his life from 1947 to 1955, he would run 6\u20137 miles a day. His uncle, Charlie Piccento, said he even followed his routine and ran on Christmas mornings and every holiday, including his and his children\u2019s birthdays. He never missed a day during his 8 year career, not one. And that was in between fights, not in training camp. Rocky also did calisthenics and other conditioning exercises in between fights. He would work the heavy bag especially, (in his case, the heavy bag was REALLY heavy!), just to help stay in top shape. His normal weight, with no discernible fat, was 205, and he made sure he never gained a pound over that in between fights. When he went to training camp, Rocky became a warrior-monk. In Undefeated: Rocky Marciano - The Fighter Who Refused to Lose By Everett Skehan, it is documented that Rocky refused to take phone calls in camp. He didn\u2019t want radios, (It was before the widespread use of television) or newspapers, or discussions about anything except boxing and training. He had no contact with his family or anyone in the outside world. He was there solely to train from before sunup to after sunset. Ben Bently, Rocky's press agent, said after signing for a fight he would increase his running in the morning to 9-10 miles. And then the last week before a fight he would increase his running to 12-15 miles in the mornings. EVERY morning. In camp, he would run in the morning, and fast walk another 10 miles at night. He also did wind sprints during the day! He liked to run short distances, a couple of hundred yards, up a hill in training as fast as he could, and then run back down facing backwards! And then he repeated over and over until he was exhausted. He used a speed bag but not like anyone else does or did, he would hit it with hooks and slow power shots to work on his accuracy. He trained using a custom made 300 pound heavy bag. He would power clean a giant rock and toss it forward with both hands. (the rock weighed over a hundred pounds) He did crunches that combined kicking a heavy medicine ball out to the trainer He believed in calisthenics, and did up to several hours worth in addition to everything else. Several days a week Rocky went shoulder deep in a swimming pool and threw hundreds of underwater punches for up to an hour. And then, in the late afternoon, Rocky would spar! Rocky literally trained every day from before sunup, to after sundown. For three months! So he could do 15 rounds. No science based training today could match Rocky\u2019s old time regimin for intensity, or his old time trainer, Charlie Goldman for knowledge. There isn\u2019t a trainer today capable of taking Rocky Marciano and making him undisputed champion. There is a price for that toughness and peerless conditioning. Rocky had to train year round, and he trained in between fights harder than most fighters train in camp! His training regimin was so good, Cus D\u2019Amato took part of it for Mike Tyson Cus D\u2019Amato was wiling to do a thing that many trainers are not: take ideas from other people. In this case, Cus, a long time acquaintance of the great Charlie Goldman took his idea of a 300 pound heavy bag (invented for Rocky Marciano) and used it with Mike Tyson. From the time he was 13, for the next five years, Mike used Rocky\u2019s 300 pound bag to help develop his natural strength into punching power. Cus did not adopt the rest of Rocky\u2019s regimin, the year round running and endless conditioning, because it simply was too difficult for Tyson or anyone else. Tyson had legendary workouts - but nothing next to the Rock\u2019s! That kind of conditioning requires monk-like devotion that gets harder and harder to do as a fighter ages and the body and mind simply rebel Marvin Hagler said it best: \u201cIt\u2019s tough to get out of bed to do roadwork at 5am when you\u2019ve been sleeping in silk pajamas\u201d Marvin Hagler Quotes - Reemus Boxing Nor is it merely mental, as success erodes a fighter\u2019s drive for a better life. The physical strain of the workouts necessary to use a swarmer style break a man down. Joe Frazier wrote in Smokin\u2019 Joe his autobiography, that physically he simply could not keep his conditioning up later in his career, and: \u201cthat little slippage, that small inability to fight as hard in the later rounds, it caught up with me..\u201d Marciano had a bad back going into his last fight. For the first time in his career he was unable to spar as much as he wanted to. While Rocky\u2019s retirement at that point in time was due to his despicable manager and his thievary, the inevitable breakdown of Rocky\u2019s body would have brought retirement sooner rather than later. There is a reason that three of the four great swarmers, Armstrong, Frazier, and Marciano, all retired at 32.

            "answer_text": "Rocky Marciano. The Rock had short arms, average hand speed, sub par defense and he cut easily. But he hit like a howitzer and he NEVER got tired. His dedication to training is legendary. He will go down in the record book as an all time great heavyweight, not to mention undefeated. And he did It on strength, conditioning, and the heart of a lion. He didn\u2019t have much else. I mean that with the utmost respect. Others here have detailed his training regimen far more eloquently than I can. It\u2019s literally monk-like. Marciano willed himself into greatness through his dedication to training and toughness. I feel he is the only correct answer to this question. ",
