            "answer_text": "The Mongols took very few captives during the conquering of their empire. If someone with a useful ability (artisan, craftsman, etc.) surrendered without resistance, they would, in most cases, immediately accept them into society. Most of the time, they would freely work under Chinggis Khan. Sometimes, however, people with extremely unique abilities would be brought as slaves to the Mongol court at Karakorum; a man named Guillaume Boucher, for example, was forcibly taken to to the Mongol court as a captive. But, due to his immense skill, he was provided with numerous assistants and a large working studio. So, although he was officially a slave, he was treated as a higher-up in the imperial court. One of his famed fountains can be seen below:  The silver tree at Karakorum- 1250-[Study of Karakorum by Scholars] When the Mongols faced resistance while conquering, on the other hand, they would show no mercy. They would eradicate entire populations, sparing few. The few that were spared were most often used as human shields in their next battles; they were placed at the front of the Mongol army, protecting them as they advanced. I imagine that, while they were with the Mongols, they were treated very poorly.  Human Shield Image: Lock, Stock, and History So, the Mongol treatment of captives was not a hard-set rule, rather it varied based on the situation by which they were acquired.

            "answer_text": "It depended on who you were. If you were a talented artisan with a worthwhile craft you were recruited as such. Combatants were put to death. Community leaders were locked in an airtight box and allowed to suffocate. Slaves generally remained just that although they and other people like farmers were made to become eunuchs. Older women were killed or sometimes allowed to live if they had the ability to work. The young boys were judged on their merits and either became slaves or understudies to artisans. The young women were breeding material along with their not yet ready younger sisters. I\u2019m not quite sure how musicians, intellectuals, or similar folks were treated except the typical treatment was castration so they could keep their mind and talents free of distractions. ",
