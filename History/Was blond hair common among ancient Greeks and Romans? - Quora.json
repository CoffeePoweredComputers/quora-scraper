            "answer_text": "From what I know, blond hair was not common among ancient Greeks, but it existed. Perhaps, 10% of Greeks have blond hair. Also, sandy blond was considered blond or light to Greeks. I believe Alexander the Great had somewhat light hair, but the kind of blond hair you commonly see in Scandinavia wasn\u2019t common in ancient Greece. I believe I read of ancient Greeks even dying their hair to a blondish color. It depends what you mean by common. It wasn\u2019t rare, it was maybe somewhat common, but the overwhelming majority of Greeks then and now had brown hair, I would say. Having dark hair was associated with being Roman. If you had blond hair there was a chance you had Celtic or Germanic ancestry. This doesn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t non-Celtic or non-Germanic blonds in the peninsula. There would have been some, but a small minority, I would say, like Greece. It seems some Greeks were noted to have more light hair than other Greeks like the Spartans. Again, I would still a minority probably, but more than others. It is kind of like how light hair is sometimes exaggerated among Kurdish Iraqis when say only 16% have light hair. That\u2019s significant, of course, in the Middle East. The Greeks also associated some groups like the Thracians with light hair. There were definitely Romans with blond and red hair. How common was it? Your guess is as good as mine, but you could find people with Roman ancestry with those features like Brutus and Gaias Octavius, it appears.
