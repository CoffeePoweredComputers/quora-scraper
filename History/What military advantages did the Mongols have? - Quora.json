            "answer_text": "Surprise, distinct goals and unique system of warfare. China was totally unprepared for a cavalry based army that had no interest in governing or negotiating for control of taxes or titles. The mongols saw cities as repositories of wealth to be held hostage, bot as population centres to be controlled. When they invaded they acted as a mob protection racket, moving from city to the offering two options; pay up or die. This was not what most agricultural civilizations see has the point of total warfare. Raiding might be done by a portion of the population but not by the entire nation with the women and children in tow. This meant that the mongols had no supply lines to worry about over extending, nor were they interested in treaties for title, lands or taxation. This combined with a much more mobile force than what mainland China was used to facing meant that they were almost never able to choose when or where the battles took place. ",
