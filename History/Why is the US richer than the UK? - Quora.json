            "answer_text": "Its not, it depends on how you measure the wealth. On many wealth indicators the UK is much richer than the US. According to Wikipedia\u2026. Median wealth in the USA is: $61,667 Median wealth in the UK is: $97,169 That means that the average American is much poorer than the the average UK person. Where America excels is in extreme wealth at the top end of the scale. In the UK, a CEO at a big company will for example get paid $5 million. In the US they will get paid $20 million. This create the false impression that \u201cAmerica is richer\u201d, but its only the mega-rich who are on aggregate richer, and this is what clouds the real picture. Life expectancy is also lower in the US, and US wages are eaten up with huge healthcare and transportation costs which don\u2019t exist in the UK. Slightly higher American salaries are therefore eaten up with higher basic living costs and lower American standards. The UK work/life balance is also much richer than the US\u2026in the US paid vacation is very low and maternity/paternity pay is non-existent compared to the UK....US people are therefore working much longer hours for comparatively less return..all factoring into the wealth equation. As for GDP per capita, UK GDP per capita overtook the US in 2007, but has since fallen down below due to the 2008 recession and strong government spending cuts in the UK. As government spending returns, the UK will once again overtake the US. According to the world bank: In 2007, UK GDP per capita was: $50,134 In 2007, USA GDP per capita was: $48,061 US GDP per capita on aggregate overtook the UK and Western Europe during WW2, as the whole world was being devastated from WW2 (and WW1), with the exception of America which was geographically isolated from the devastation. This created a 5\u201310 year GDP per capita gap, where Western Europe lost growth during the wars, and was therefore playing catch-up after. Western Europe and the UK have also seen the loss of their global empires which have created huge economic changes. There has also been huge changes in Eastern Europe with the rise and fall of Communism, creating knock-on effects on the economies of Western Europe. All of which have ultimately affected UK GDP per capita over the last few decades. The real GDP per capita gap has since closed and the UK overtook the US in 2007. However, changes in government spending since then has caused the US economy to enter into an economic bubble which isn\u2019t sustainable. Im expecting a strong correction in US GDP per capita to fall below Western Europe. The fact that the UK managed to overtake US GDP per capita in 2007 (after fighting 2 world wars by its soil and losing its global empire) is proof that American economic advantages are grossly exaggerated.

            "answer_text": "There are different ways to address this question. The comparison I find most meaningful in assessing the relative wealth of nations is \u201cper capita GDP\u201d, how much the economy produces each year divided by the total population. According to 2017 numbers from the World Bank and the IMF, the USA produces around 35% more output per person than the UK. That is a massive difference in productivity, so that alone is a strong explanation for the difference in wealth. There are many factors that may contribute to this. Among these may be: The USA has a broader resource base than the UK and is less reticent about exploiting the resourcesThe USA has a far more entrepreneurial culture than the UKThe USA has far less generous social security, so people may have stronger incentives to workThe USA has far less employment protection, so people who don\u2019t work well have little job securityAnnual holiday allowances in the USA are far lower than in the UK. There is no Federal obligation to give people time off, though several states have their own lawsThe UK economy still carries many of the inefficiencies that arise in state-run enterprises. There is well established global evidence that private enterprises deliver more rapid growth and greater profitabilityIt is not my intention to pass judgement on the value of these differences. People should feel more secure in the UK and may be happier, perhaps that\u2019s a price worth paying for the difference. ",
