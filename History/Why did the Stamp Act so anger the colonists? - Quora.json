            "answer_text": "The Stamp Act seemed a simple way for Parliament to raise revenue from the colonies, but they misjudged the effect of the policy and misread the temper of the public.  Given the level of protest seen against the Stamp Act alone, it is remarkable that it took a decade for the revolution to begin in earnest. It is especially remarkable given the number of persons agitating for trouble. The ministry of George Grenville decided to extract at least some of the money used to support America, estimated at about \u20a460 thousand in 1765, from the colonies in the form of a stamp tax on all legal and business papers, newspapers, printed forms, playing cards, wall paper, and licenses. Different taxes were also specified for deeds or grants of land of less than 100 acres, of 100 to 200 acres, and of 200 to 320 acres. The stamp tax was clearly the first attempt to levy an imperial tax from outside the colonial legislatures. The Grenville ministry sought to minimize the potential reaction to the stamp tax by appointing American stamp agents rather than English ones. Moreover, the insignificant size of the tax assured many in Britain that any protests would be minimal. The Stamp Act was calculated to fall heaviest upon the wealthy that it was thought used more documents than the ordinary people. The problem with an expanding cone of government regulation is that even those doing the regulation often don\u2019t see its true effect or reach. This plan misfired badly. It seems that the Grenville ministry miscalculated both the unforeseen effect of the tax and the breadth of the reaction to it. Unlike the frontier farmers who rarely dealt with public papers, colonial shippers and merchants were required to take out numerous public documents while conducting business including bills of lading, clearance permits, insurance policies, rental agreements, mortgages, attachments of property, and all kinds of contracts. The Stamp Act also affected lawyers, newspaper editors, printers, and an army of municipal employees who signed indentures, produced public documents, or ran a licensed business. London viewed the colonials as illiterate country bumpkins. As many as 70 percent of colonials read newspapers with the stamp prominently in view, and in an economy as regulated as was that of Anglo-America, almost every businessman, craftsman, street vendor, inn and shopkeeper was required to obtain an annual license and pay the tax. [i] It has been estimated that one in twenty Anglo-Americans were required to take out a license or permit of some kind to follow their occupation. The tax on playing cards was particularly irksome as almost everyone played cards as a form of diversion, and the uncoated cards of the 18th century wore out quickly. New decks with the King\u2019s tax stamp on the package screamed taxation to every person who played whist or cribbage in a tavern or in a parlor. Contrary to the hopes of Parliament, the whole of Anglo-America seemed to unite in opposition to the Stamp Act. In May 1765, seven anti-stamp tax resolutions were proposed in the Virginia House of Burgesses. The first reaction in the colonies to the unprecedented Virginia Resolves was one of shock, yet many Americans found themselves in accord with their primary thrust. Soon even the common people began to denounce taxation without representation, and they spoke openly of supporting the rights of Englishmen, of defending American liberties, and of government by the consent of the governed. The argument over specific regulations and stamp taxes had quickly evolved into an all-out battle concerning constitutional principles.  [i] In Dedham, Massachusetts in 1765, on a petition to the government every man signed with his signature rather than using a mark attesting to their literacy.

            "answer_text": "William of Orange (Dutch) and his English wife, Mary negotiated a deal with Parliament that they would take monarchy but recognize that Parliament was supreme especially insofar as it came to taxation. Taxes had to originate in Parliament, whose House of Commons members were elected. British Americans could not accept that they would be taxed with their representatives voting it. Next, The concept of a free press toke strong hold in England in early part of the 18th century. The Stamp Act required each sold newspaper to be subject to the tax. The Stamp Act was the start of the War of Independence. I think it would be more accurate to call America, The Land of Liberties, which include a Free Press, the right to assemble, the right to a jury trial and the right to vote. ",
