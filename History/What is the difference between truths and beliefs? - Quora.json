            "answer_text": "Preliminary concerns about the conventional relationship between truth, belief, knowledge and justification. For the sake of argument, accept the premise that the environment is objective and our relationship to it is subjective. Philosophical convention has determined that \u201cjustified true belief is knowledge\u201d. Philosophical convention has connected four significant concepts to describe the relationship between a human and her environment. This philosophical assessment is incorrect. It does not provide an accurate description of how a human uses symbols for orientation. If you examine the paradigm that a human uses for orientation, you can see that there is no distinct separation between truth and belief. The Webster Collegiate Dictionary says\u2026. Truth comes from the root word which means \u201cfidelity\u201d. Truth is defined as \u201cthe state of being the case\u201d\u2026. Believe has an etymology which comes from a word meaning\u201cto allow\u201d. It is defined as \u201cto accept as true, genuine, or real\u201d, \u201cto have a firm conviction\u201d, \u201cto hold an opinion\u201d, \u201cto consider to be true or honest\u201d\u2026. Justice means \u201cto prove or show to be just\u201d\u2026. Just means \u201chaving a basis in or conforming to fact or reason\u2026. Know means \u201cto perceive directly, have direct cognition of\u201d, \u201dto have understanding of\u201d. The key attribute of belief is the \u2018acceptance\u2019 that something is true. The key attribute of truth is in the accurate assessment of environment. The key attribute of justified is the provision of proof. The key attribute of knowledge is direct perception or understanding a concept that relates to direct perception. Conventional philosophy has stumbled and here is why. We are organisms that are made to assess and integrate with our environment. We have been given specific machinery and propensities to perform these tasks. Our machinery and propensity, added to \u2018that which we have previously experienced\u2019, provide the limits to our perspective. The only accurate elucidation of the objective environment is through direct perception. A major way that we assess our environment is by interpreting our perceptions through the use of an abstraction. Our main tool to do this, besides memory, is our ability to use symbols. When we attach a symbol to a perception it becomes incorporated with a group of other pertinent symbols. This group of pertinent symbols is dominated by a system of beliefs. Anything put into words is laden with beliefs. When trying to prove a truth, belief tells the person where to look for evidence and belief tells the person what to accept as evidence. Empiricism and independent verification is the closest we can get to a truth but we can\u2019t always depend on what we see and consensus is not necessarily a good indicator of the truth. When it comes to evidence, the religious fundamentalist\u2019s truths are based on less rigorous criteria than a scientist\u2019s truths but the fundamentalist is also using empiricism and independent verification. Belief is the artisan that creates our conceptual foundations. Belief, aided by knowledge and environmental feedback is the stage director for our whole perceptual orientation. We create our assessments of the environment by using an internal model. This model is constructed with the use of a belief system and it is given credibility by that which we consider as knowledge. The bottom line is that there is no discreet difference between truths and beliefs. ",

            "answer_text": "A truth is a universal statement evaluated to be true by computation. Any one or any thing that can perform this computation can derive the same truth, and it's immune to what anyone believes or thinks. It is objective, and it is universal. A belief is a personal statement evaluated to be true by that person. Without that person, that belief is unattainable.  A belief can be anything, and it is only sustained by the person who possesses it. It is subjective and personal. It will live and die, and hopefully evolve, with that person. Belief is a physiological tool, implemented within our biological architecture. It is key to our capacity to be intelligent. Thus as people, we cannot help but believe, because we are built to believe. Belief is physical. They are physically true. And pulling on someone's beliefs is like pulling their purse. Most will take offense, and are not prepared to let go so easily. In language, \"truth\" really has many meanings, and it helps if you can differentiate a few. There is the universal scientific truth that many pretend to understand, but don't. There is the objective common sense truth that is deemed universal but is not. And there are those who believe their beliefs are true and that instincts that govern belief can detect truth, which of course it cannot. Whenever someone uses the word \"truth\", they usually refer to one of these three, without revealing which, not knowing which, or thinking they're one in the same. They are not. The social truth is different from scientific truth in how it is determined. Socially, the truth is highly democratic and consensus driven. Consensus doesn't guarantee something is scientifically true, but unfortunately our everyday truth is still governed and spread by consensus - even in science. If you say something new, regardless of whether it is scientifically true, most people will brush you off saying things like \"I've never heard that before\" and \"go back to school.\" Careers in academia can also be extremely political. Reputations are built on consensus, and most - even scientists - will equate a reputation with truth, though it is far from it. Then what is truth really? For all practical scientific purposes, truth is a simple instrument of logic that can be applied to a statement written in any language, and it is the result of computation. The truth cannot be obtained any other way. Mathematics and computer code can most rigidly enforce and evaluate truth within their systems. Statements in natural languages are harder to evaluate, since they are mostly referential, and will entail validating some assertion about the real world beyond pure statements. For this validation there is the scientific method, but this science must be performed properly to obtain a proper scientific answer. In many if not most cases this is impractical. And is most cases, you will be deferred to what others agree is true or be forced to argue over what people believe is true. Unless these help with accurate calculations, they have very little to do with any scientific truth whatsoever. They have nothing to do with each other. But if truth is only about statements, what is reality? Isn't reality the assembly of all that is true? Nature, yes, can be considered to be all true. But nature isn't our reality, and this is what throws us off. The reality we experience and understand is a direct result of how we are physically. We receive input in many forms: Sounds, images, taste, smell, emotions, etc. It is no coincidence that our reality is composed purely of these things. But to someone who is blind, their reality does not include images. And as we strip away all the instruments we possess, we are left with no input, and ultimately lose grasp of any reality whatsoever. Yet, nature will still prevail. Nature is the culmination of all sources of potential input. Be it sonar, temperature, altitude... all that is measurable and sensible originates in nature plus the device that senses it. Understanding this distinction and this process will help you understand the nature of truth the most. In nature, everything is true. But if everything is one thing, then it is redundant and inconsequential. Like the air being everywhere, there is no need for us to recognize it. Instead, we recognize wind and smell, but never air itself. This ubiquitous truth in nature is then fed to us as input through the collection of instruments we possess, and is reinterpreted. Nature is open to interpretation, and this is where, not true, but false is born. Is what we see actually what it is? In nature, everything is what it is. But for us to interpret what is, there is a flow of information and an interpretation that must take place. Our minds must acquire the truths relevant to us from our exterior, and to get it right, we must be able to distinguish what is not true. It is at this level, at the level of thoughts and statements, that truth begins to matter and become relevant. But this reality, this language, is a construct. It is not nature itself.  As such, truth is a measure of a quality. Much like numbers and letters, true and false occupy a specific space within an asserted set of abstractions. These are not real. They are abstract. But they are not random either. You will not find a number or an alphabetical character in nature. These are products of our minds. Yet, they are governed by specific rules, and they are the tools that help us build a model of nature internally based on what exists externally. And truth is a measure, because some statements are truer than others. The pursuit of truer statements is what results in scientific progress. Then are beliefs useless? Science is new, and before science belief is all we had. We would get creative with our beliefs, and those with power would impose them on others. This did work to some extent, but is still not comparable to science. But even today, beliefs to have a place, if not only for that fact that we cannot help but possess them. Beliefs are natural. The beliefs you have may not evaluate to true, but the fact that you possess them is a reflection of something true. What is it a reflection of?  It is a reflection of how you came to believe it. There is greater truth in this reflection, than within each belief itself. And the moment you really get this intuition, your beliefs will become valuable once again -- more valuable than they have ever been. ",
