            "answer_text": "First of all, it\u2019s important to realize that the endgame can only be mastered if coupled with a deep understanding of chess in general, including opening and middlegame theories. That means that not only endgame means will lead you to endgame mastery, but with that said we can look at some of the best resources out there. For internet resources, there\u2019s a new website, http://www.simplifychess.com, which has great options for training. For instance, over there you can find an endgame study plan that will direct you to the most important endgames and principles according to your level.  You can also begin by ascertaining your level, making use of their analytical tool.  And from the study plan you can access lessons or practice with a computer for any of the mentioned endings.  There are many good endgame books easily accessible through the internet or at a fair price online. Some of the best, in my opinion, are: Dvoretsky\u2019s Endgame Manual.  This book spans endgames from the very basic to the most complex, and is a good help for anyone, from beginner to master level. It\u2019s a must for anyone seeking to attain endgame mastery. Shereshevsky\u2019s Endgame Strategy is a worthy initiation into the world of deeper endgame thinking.  Whereas Dvoretsky\u2019s book is focused on learning the rules to prevail in specific endgames, this book has a greater focus on the conceptual aspect of endings. For instance, it deals in great depth with principles such as the centralization of the King, not hurrying in the endgame, etc. For a general overview of chess endings that doesn\u2019t go into great detail, but is useful and didactic enough nonetheless, either Pandolfini\u2019s or Jeremy Silman\u2019s endgame books are good options. These books are especially helpful for beginners, but can also provide some instruction for players up to a 2000-2100 FIDE level (Silman\u2019s book claims to lead you all the way to 2400-FIDE endgame level, but that\u2019s a bit overblown). These are only a few resources, of course. There are many more, chess being after all a rich game with a vast and ever-growing literature, but you can\u2019t go wrong with the foregoing tools. Good luck! ",
