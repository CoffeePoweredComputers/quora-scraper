            "answer_text": "Powerful? What do you mean powerful. If you mean by the most cults and rituals, this would have to be Anubis (Anu) who is the God of Mummification\u2026 Also, Anubis is the god which weighs your heart against a feather. Many people gave gifts to the Black Dog as a form of respecting the dead! Anubis prepared people for death in many ways, not just wrapping them and/or their cats as mummies. He was patron of the dead because you went to be with Osiris (Ausar) the God of the Underworld. Set was worshiped, but mostly by the Hykos when they invaded. This is because Set was also a form of Baal (Ba\u2019el) from the Hykos land. Here Set was known as a ears down God\u2026 but in Egypt he always has his ears up! Many people think Set is an Anteater, when in fact he is a Donkey! In Mesopotamia he was known as the God Ass, which is where Asia got its name from. So in terms of popular it would have to be Set, who was also worshiped outside of of Egypt by many different nations under many different names! ",
