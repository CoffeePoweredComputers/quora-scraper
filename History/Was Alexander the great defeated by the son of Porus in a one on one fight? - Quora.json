            "answer_text": "Porus is overhyped, he was pretty easily defeated, just not on same excessively easy scale upon which the chronicles would dictate he earlier defeated the Persians. Without the comparable ease with which he earlier walked through the Persians, this would be recorded as a one sided victory He was more of someone that posed a good candidate to be a vassal than anything else. His son reportedly died in battle, anything beyond that is tabloid content written to entertain. He lost, Alex won. That's really all we know, and honestly that's how it'll remain. Mind you there is no actual archaeological evidence nor contemporary writings on Alexander nor Porus. So while highly unlikely\u2026 it is possible they're all made up anyway. I mean nobody knows where this battle took place, let alone the city that was founded in that spot\u2026 pretty big archaeological gap right there and it's not for lack of searching\u2026 But even if we believe the sources, they never mention this duel and that's certainly something they'd highlight. Alexander would have always been surrounded by his personal guards, utterly impossible for anyone to ever get a chance to fight him in a duel. Only situation where that kind of combat was remotely possible was when he eagerly charged over a wall and the ladders broke immediately after. This meant he was somewhat isolated with only 2 guards for a little while. Most dire situation he ever faced, still had two guards protecting him and an entire army desperately trying to join him. Even if Alexander insisted on a one on one battle there's simply no way his guards would have allowed it. Alexander suffered many injuries but mostly from missiles. His personal guards never would have allowed any one on one fight to occur. In fact most recorded arguments he had with anyone usually involved them telling him they wanted him to lead from the rear and stay out of danger entirely because the very fact that he was within missile range itself was so troubling to them.

            "answer_text": "No. You are likely referring to the advance guard sent to harass Alexander\u2019s river crossing once it had been discovered. Sometime in May of 326 BC Alexander effected a night time crossing of the Hydaspes River when it was discovered by Alexander\u2019s men that they had not crossed over to the eastern bank of the river but in fact had ferried themselves onto a narrow forested sandbar in the middle of the river. Fortunately for Alexander the river between this sandbar and the eastern bank of the Hydaspes was fordable although it would cause a delay of several hours before that portion of the army would be ready to close in on Porus\u2019s main army. It was during the crossing of the shallow river ford between the sandbar and river bank that Alexander\u2019s presence was detected by Porus\u2019s scouts who quickly relayed this to Porus some 10 -12 miles down river. Upon receiving this alarming information Porus was in a quandary. He couldn\u2019t break camp and head up stream as there was the main Macedonian camp opposite that of his own across the river. Thus he send a highly mobile cavalry contingent replete with battle chariots to harass and intercept Alexander\u2019s expeditionary force that would soon bear down upon Porus. This small cavalry force was lead by either the son or brother of King Porus who shared the king\u2019s name which has caused some confusion through the years. Unfortunately for both Poruses (or however you\u2019d express Porus in the plural form) involved the force proved to be inadequate to stop Alexander who had already finished the crossing and was in the process of embarking on their down river push to confront the main Indian force. Prince Porus was killed in the vain attempt to slow the Macedonians in route to the main engagement with King Porus which would culminate in Alexander\u2019s last great pitched battle victory before his death a few years later after his return to Babylon in 323 BC. I just now realized that I misread this question. Was Alexander defeated in a one-on-one fight with Porus\u2019s son also named Porus? The answer is a categorical NO. Obviously had Alexandre lost such a confrontation then the Battle of Hydaspes wouldn\u2019t have taken place later that day not to mention all the other recorded events of his incredible life yet to transpire.
