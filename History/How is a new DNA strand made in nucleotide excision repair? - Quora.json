            "answer_text": "Nucleotide excision repair is done by DNA polymerase, the same enzyme that adds nucleotides in DNA replication. Whenever a mistake is detected (physical deformation in DNA) the polymerase will stop adding nucleotides, but excise the mistake and even take out some of the correct nucleotides it just added just to make sure it got it. With a free 3\u2019 OH, DNA polymerase can then add the correct nucleotides (So the complementary DNA strands will fit nicely together like lock and key). This all occurs on the same strand. It would be inefficient to make a brand new strand when 1 base pair doesn\u2019t match, instead the very enzyme that makes the strand also has the responsibility to fix any mistakes (in DNA replication) After the polymerase proofreads we have other proteins that will also check for any errors in DNA replication. Altogether all the proteins make it so that the error rate comes to about 1 mistake for every 100,000,000 or a 0.0000000001 chance of error. However DNA can get damaged and the way to repair works very similarly to DNA replication proofreading. Except that DNA is already sealed together as a double strand, so we can\u2019t use DNA polymerase because it requires a free 3\u2019OH. So instead DNA glycosylases detect the physical kink caused by mismatched pairs and recruit an endonuclease (endo=in nuclease=cleave) that cleaves the phosphodiester (3\u2019 OH to 5\u2019 Phosphate) of the damaged strand. (Sometimes the glycosylases take care of the excision themselves by flipping the damaged DNA away to expose it and cleaving it themselves). Once damaged DNA is excised out, it leaves space and free 3\u2019OH for DNA polymerase to come in and add the correct nucleotides, add Ligase to seal any gaps that DNA pol can\u2019t and bam the strand is repaired good as new and ready to transcribe the right mRNA to translate the right amino acids and make the proper shape that determines proper function of proteins.

            "answer_text": "Nucleotide excision repair is a DNA repair mechanism. DNA damage occurs constantly because of chemicals, radiation and other mutagens. Three excision repair pathways exist to repair single stranded DNA damage: Nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and DNA mismatch repair. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) In the simplest terms, NER: (1) recognizes the damage, (2) assembles a repair complex and unwinds a section of DNA on both strands, (3) performs dual incision damage excision activities, (4) synthesizes new nucleotides using the undamaged DNA strand, then (5) ligates the repaired section of DNA.
