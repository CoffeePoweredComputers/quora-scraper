            "answer_text": "There are a number of un-evolved answers here. How about this\u2026 Life isn\u2019t actually all that interesting? Eat, sleep, shit, shower, shave, work, pay bills, and entertain yourself in between. Maybe if you have some money you can buy something \u2018exciting\u2019. But in general, life is not really an \u2018adventure\u2019. We\u2019re just here. No one \u2018succeeds\u2019. Even the richest people in the world will (and have) died. Everyone goes through a lot of different experiences no matter how \u2018good\u2019 you think they have it. Friends will come and friends will go. But they are all just \u2018people\u2019: flawed, eating, sleeping, shitting, showering, shaving, working, paying bills, and entertaining themselves in between. The new Star Wars movie will be over after two hours and 21 minutes. The next season of Game of Thrones isn\u2019t going to be too different from the first 6. Every football game is the same. Going on a killing spree is generally illegal. So we have fairly mundane existences to contend with while we struggle to maintain them until we die. This doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy your life. It doesn\u2019t exactly mean you are depressed to not be all that interested. It means you probably get it and don\u2019t need drama. For the most part we are all just fish in a giant tank, waiting for the roof to open up, and for someone to throw flakes down on us that we can suck from the surface and poop out later. Sometimes, no one comes to throw flakes. We are swimming with our own poop and the water is filthy and the other fish just won\u2019t let us chill. Go for a walk. ",
