The span of recorded history is roughly less than five thousand years, beginning with the earliest linguistic records in the third millennium BC in Mesopotamia and Egypt.Classical antiquity \u2013 Broad term for a long period of cultural history centered on the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the interlocking civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, collectively known as the Greco-Roman world. It is the period in which Greek and Roman society flourished and wielded great influence throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.Post-classical history \u2013 Period of time that immediately followed ancient history. Depending on the continent, the era generally falls between the years CE 200\u2013600 and CE 1200\u20131500. The major classical civilizations the era follows are Han China (ending in 220), the Western Roman Empire (in 476), the Gupta Empire (in the 550s), and the Sasanian Empire (in 651).Middle Ages (also called Dark Ages) \u2013 Lasted from the 5th to the 14th century. It began with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 and is variously demarcated by historians as ending with the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, merging into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery.Early Middle AgesHigh Middle AgesLate Middle AgesModern history \u2013 After the post-classical eraEarly modern period \u2013 The chronological limits of this period are open to debate. It emerges from the Late Middle Ages (c. 1500), demarcated by historians as beginning with the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, in forms such as the Italian Renaissance in the West, the Ming Dynasty in the East, and the rise of the Aztec in the New World. The period ends with the beginning of the Age of Revolutions.Late modern period \u2013 Began approximately in the mid-18th century; notable historical milestones included the French Revolution, the American Revolution, the Industrial Revolution and the Great Divergence.Machine Age (1880\u20131945)Age of Oil (after 1901)World War I (1914\u20131918)Interwar period (1918\u20131939)Roaring Twenties (1920\u20131929)Great Depression (1929\u20131939)World War II (1939\u20131945)Contemporary history \u2013 History within living memory. It shifts forward with the generations, and today is the span of historic events from approximately 1945 that are immediately relevant to the present time. For example, the Post-Modern movement (Soviet Union and United States, 1973\u2013present)",

            "answer_text": "Although I think the previous answers are very good, I think there is a slightly different interpretation that you may find useful. It should also be noted that these terms really apply to European history and are not universal throughout the world. The \u201cancient period\u201d encompasses the period from before mankind developed technological skills through to when the Western World (essentially Europe) reached its first height of technological skill and started to slide backward. This is most commonly dated to 476 CE when the last Western Roman Emperor abdicated. The medieval period is defined by a loss if technological skill and increase in superstition. It ends as a renewed interest in scientific and philosophical thought start to take hold. There is less agreement on when the medieval period ends than with the ancient period. Some date it to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Others, to the colonization of what became the Americas. Another choice is the beginning of the renaissance but that has its own set of complications. The modern period begins when the medieval period ends. As with the ancient period, the modern period is best characterized by the flowering and growth of science, technology, literature and art. ",
