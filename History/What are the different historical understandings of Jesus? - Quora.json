Jesus as: Apocalyptic prophet along with E. P. Sanders, Maurice Casey, and Bart Ehrman. Bart Ehrman aligns himself with the century-old view of Albert Schweitzer that Jesus expected an apocalypse during his own generation, and he bases some of his views on the argument that the earliest gospel sources (for which he assumes Markan priority.) The probable origin of the New Testament gospels, visibly plagiarized in the Greek text, and the foundation edited and enlarged by other gospel writers. As far as I know, Ehrman is the only scholar who is curious enough to examine the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, chapters 4 and 5, probably written by the end of AD 52, which present Jesus as far more apocalyptic than other Christian sources produced towards the end of the 1st century, contending that the apocalyptic messages were progressively toned down, putting two and two together. See: ''Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium'' by Bart D. Ehrman ",

            "answer_text": "As Robert M. Price well puts \"The \"historical Jesus\" reconstructed by New Testament scholars is always a reflection of the individual scholars who reconstruct him. Albert Schweitzer was perhaps the single exception, and he made it painfully clear that previous questers for the historical Jesus had merely drawn self-portraits. All unconsciously used the historical Jesus as a ventriloquist dummy. Jesus must have taught the truth, and their own beliefs must have been true, so Jesus must have taught those beliefs.\" My point here is simply that, even if there was a historical Jesus lying back of the gospel Christ, he can never be recovered. If there ever was a historical Jesus, there isn't one any more. All attempts to recover him turn out to be just modern remythologizings of Jesus. Every \"historical Jesus\" is a Christ of faith, of somebody's faith. So the \"historical Jesus\" of modern scholarship is no less a fiction.  So historicists can not even agree who Jesus was, so we have things like Jesus being an apocaliptic prophet, mythologized king manu of edessa, leader of the space aliens, buddhist, leader of the mushroom cult, rabbi, rebel etc ",
