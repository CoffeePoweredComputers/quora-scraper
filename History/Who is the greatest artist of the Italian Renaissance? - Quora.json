            "answer_text": "Oh man, it is like asking which Italian city amongst the most famous ones gets the title of most beautiful. I don\u2019t know\u2026Michelangelo\u2019s genius that made him become an architect, a painter and a sculptor? Leonardo\u2019s tremendous knowledge that made his paintings perfectly recognisable by his sfumato whilst he was inventing a prototype of the airplane? What about Raphael\u2019s perfection in his Madonne, whose beauty and forme made him a legend, given the fact that he was in his 20s? What about Botticelli: the union between the sacred and the profane, with his Primavera representing the symbol of the Florentine Renaissance. Oh, well, maybe Brunelleschi? You know, the dome of Santa Maria Novella in Florence is pretty famous amongst art aficionados. Did I mention Piero della Francesca\u2019s perspectives, Perugino\u2019s colours or Rosso Fiorentino\u2019s figures? Or, did I call up Mantegna or Titian? Tintoretto? Pontormo? Well. Of course, as Art History is compulsory in Italy, everyone would say the magnifica triade: Michelangelo, Leonardo e Raffaello. It is funny, as another magnificent triade represents our literature: Dante, Petrarca e Boccaccio. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow. This is a tough one. My favourite is Andrea del Sarto, pure genius. He was a century ahead of everyone:  This painting is called \u201cMadonna delle Arpie\u201d and it dates to 1517, ten years before the sack of Rome. It already displays elements of manierismo and shows a taste in the use of colors that is closer to the end of the Renaissance and beginning of baroque than it is to the environment where it was produced. Andrea is an interesting charachter too. Definitely worth studying. ",
