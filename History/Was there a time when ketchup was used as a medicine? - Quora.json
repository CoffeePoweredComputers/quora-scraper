            "answer_text": "Not that I am aware of. Tomatoes being a member of the nightshade family, there was a time when people in Europe wouldn\u2019t eat them for fear of being poisoned. In fact, one of the amusing stories of the Revolutionary war was the time Washington\u2019s cook, (a Tory spy), put tomatoes in his stew, and thinking that he had killed the general by this means, committed suicide so he wouldn\u2019t be tortured. Washington supposedly noted that the stew had tasted particularly fine. Deadly Nightshade, (belladonna), has been used as both a poison and an eye drop to dilate the pupils, but I have no knowledge of tomatoes being used in any herbal remedy. Raw milk, OTOH, has been used as a drawing poultice, both with linseed oil and with yeast bread. I have it on personal experience that bread soaked in raw milk used as a poultice is a very effective drawing solution. (Chewed tobacco is also effective as a drawing agent.) ",
