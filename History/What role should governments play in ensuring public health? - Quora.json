            "answer_text": "The Government has a very strong interest in promoting a healthy population. It is essential for a strong economy, for active participation in society, for general well being. So many things get easier if people have good health, and so many things are so much more difficult if you have bad health. Investing in health allows the Government to spend less on disability and elder care. There is a huge amount of money tied up in caring for aging people, and because people are living longer, this amount will only grow. The only hope for avoiding a fiscal catastrophe is to make sure that people stay healthy and able to work longer. So there should be care provided, especially for the very young, because problems at that age can greatly affect a person\u2019s future and their productivity. It can make a difference between someone who has to be supported for their whole life, and someone who can work in a job, and pay taxes. But there is more than just providing for health care - the Government also needs to set rules and regulation, things like keeping lead out of the water, making sure products are safe, making sure that employers don\u2019t make people risk death or disability just by taking a job. But also making sure that the question of who is paying for the care doesn\u2019t prevent people from getting treatment when they need it. A purely private approach to healthcare simply doesn\u2019t work. There is no incentive for a private hospital to treat people who can\u2019t pay. I have never been able to figure out who benefits from opposing Obamacare. Apparently Republicans think they do, but why? Who benefits from not getting health care? People who don\u2019t think they will ever be sick or injured? What kind of idiot thinks that? ",

            "answer_text": "Since the government's primary role is the protection of its citizenry, public health is an area where government is obliged to be a key player. This ought to be a straightforward matter that takes the form of such things as: Safety of food and water supplyEpidemiological monitoring and response, including quarantine, vaccinations, etc. Information and notificationsProduct safetyAs apparently straightforward as these obligations may seem, it's clear that there are massive failures, challenges, conflicts of interest and paradoxes in the government's management of public health.   Here are some of those conundrums: Medical politicization: Two examples of this that come to mind immediately are AIDS and supplements. AIDS was identified as an epidemic in the very early 1980s in medical journals. The government responded not at all for reasons that had nothing to do with the challenges of managing the issue. Even now, looking back, I think it would be difficult to unravel all the prevaricating forces on how AIDS was or was not handled.   Among those forces:  The promiscuous sexual behavior of gay men and the reality of drug addiction, both facts of urban life that politicians preferred not to deal with in their agendas. In terms of both, we had at the time that AIDS was rearing its head a conservative president in office -- he deregulated many of the laws governing business while at the same time bringing the hammer of government down on hard on the victimless crimes of drug use. Also, in that era, gay sexual life could only occur in the dark corners and shadows of life -- a repression that most likely was a causal factor in creating a culture of promiscuity and shame in which infectious disease could thrive. Gays didn't have the option to engage in sanctioned, monogamous relationships -- or indeed any relationships that would be acceptable within the main stream of society. They were deprived of the rituals of partner selection and mating and hence retreated to the shadows. Disease thrives in the shadows. A second example of politicization is the multi-billion dollar snake oil industry known as \"vitamin supplements\" that foists its deceptions on the public with the full complicity and even approval of the US government. How does this occur? Google, \"Utah\", \"Orrin Hatch\" and \"supplements\" and you'll see how this long-time US Senator created a cash cow for his state's economy by giving charlatans, hucksters and thieves license to rob, steal and burgle the entirety of US Citizenry. As credible scientists will tell you, supplements are at best useless at worst, dangerous and protected by a powerful US senator. Is this a public health issue? Yes. Is the government involved? Only in being paid to look the other way.  Corporate interests: Not easily separable from the politics of health, but a factor that prevaricates in such cases as tobacco and pharmaceuticals. To be fair, the government has progressed substantially in at least communicating the risks of habitual cigarette tobacco use. But if tobacco poses such a threat, why does the government allow for its sale at all? I don't know and I'm not advocating for prohibition, but the onus of tobacco smoking seems to be clear  (or perhaps it's not -- we still don't know why some long-time heavy smokers live long, disease-free lives while others succumb at relatively early ages). What I do know that the revenues and taxes from cigarette sales comprise a huge teat that disparate parties suckle on. State's levy onerous taxes on smokers (many of whom are addicted, pure and simple, and don't have the resources to quit); and those taxes are meant to flow toward education (here in California, anyway. But those taxes are obviously being used to fatten someone's wallets since we have one of the worst education systems in the country.) Then you have the medical industry which does quite well profiting from smoking related diseases. Speaking of the medical industry, and harking back to Ronald Reagan, among his gifts to the people who employed him was deregulation of pharmaceutical advertising which allowed whorish drug companies to depict lithe, grey-haired minxes perform yoga poses in sun-dappled fields of flowers whilst a voice-over warned in fast-clipped sotto-voce tones that the arthritis medicines they supposedly take will make your pancreas explode and your eyes bleed -- (therefore, please consult your doctor). There is credible evidence to suggest that prescription drugs are more responsible for narcotic-related deaths and disease than so-called illicit drugs, largely thanks to Reagan's carte blanche gift to Pfizer, Merck, et. al. Where is the government in this miasma? ",

            "answer_text": "Increasingly there is a need for governments to play a regulatory and coordinating role in ensuring pubic health in respective countries around the world. Given that most countries are host to numerous local and international health focused NGOs, institutions etc. in addition to their national ministries of health, one of the primary responsibilities of any government then become oversight, cooperation, complementing, and maximising efficiency of outcomes and resources. To give a specific example, if there are several NGOs actively working in country X to reduce morbidity and mortality from malaria then ideally the government should play a similar role to the conductor of an orchestra, so to speak. One NGO might be interested in mapping drug resistance among a segment of the population while another may be primarily interested in reducing infant deaths, whilst a third might be promoting behaviour change as a means of reducing infection rates. In this example the government of country X would do well to focus its financial and human resources on areas that are not covered by the NGOs whilst nevertheless maintaining keen oversight over them to ensure that ethical and legal guidelines are complied with, in addition to facilitating communication between NGOs and the ministry of health. The government in this case might also invest in training more nurses or vector control personnel to complement the activities of the NGOs rather than attempting to duplicate efforts through the development of parallel programmes. All such efforts should lead to an improvement in the situation with respect to malaria among the country\u2019s population. Ultimately it is important to bear in mind that regardless of how many bodies may be operating in the sphere of public health in any given country it should always be the national government that serves as the final reference point for all health related matters. Partly this is because of the narrow scope of work of many NGOs and institutions, but more importantly because in a functioning democracy a government should be representative (as well as be held accountable) of the needs and wishes of its electorate, especially so in an area as fundamental as public health.

            "answer_text": "The most successful countries that try to balance the role of government and free markets seem to have concluded that the government\u2019s role is to leave the actual provision of health services to the free market although there will always be a role for non-profit organizations within that structure. However, to ensure that there is universal coverage of health insurance then, to guarantee that seems impossible through a free market system without very strong oversight and regulation by the government (as is indeed the case with utilities companies in most countries, including the USA) of private insurance companies (the level of care coverage and the cost). On that basis the successful application of universal health care is an insurance market that is either a single-payer system managed by the public sector through general taxation, or a heavily regulated private sector insurance market through either for-profit or non-profit insurance entities. Most countries manage their systems through a mix of these two insurance possibilities; that is funding through a mix of taxation and private insurance, and the latter through a mix of for-profit and non-profit insurance providers. The most cost effective, however, seems to be the single-payer system that provides a total package of essential (necessary) care while adding bells and whistles through the private marketplace, providing that the actual delivery of services is in the free market with only a small proportion provided by non-profit entities (and Trusts).
