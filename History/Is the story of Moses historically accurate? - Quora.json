            "answer_text": "It's telling that no historian has answered this question. The existence of an ancient nation called Israel (or Judea) that spoke of this story as the origin story of their nation has been historically verified. Certainly the Hebrews assembled from a fairly nomadic life in the general land 'round about and united into a nation. But the fact that they believed their national origin story doesn't prove it true. Ancient Romans believed the story of Romulus and Remus, but since they were the twin sons of the war god Mars modern historians don't give it any real credence. Similarly, stories of ten miraculous plagues, pillars of fire, and the parting the Red Sea are beyond history's ability to potentially verify. Formal, evidence-based history simply cannot accept the biblical story of Moses as entirely true. But formal history potentially can accept the possibility that the story is a mythologized version of real events, like Homer's the Iliad. The city of Troy really existed and an actual war was fought over it just like the story, but the story is peppered with bits of magic and myth that virtually no one takes seriously. It is especially easy to accept the Moses story as legendary history (rather than pure legend) if the actual events can be verified by some outside source or by archaeology. Unfortunately, no such verification is known to exist. Ancient Egypt kept records of many historical events, but has no record of a mass exodus of slaves in the era when the Biblical story was to have taken place. They did have a strictly monotheistic Pharaoh named Akhenaten in roughly that same era; whose successors attempted to erase all evidence of his existence. Some (including the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud) have speculated that Akhenaten may have known Moses or even may have been Moses, and that evidence of the escaped slaves was hidden as part of the cover-up. Skeptics question how the cover up could have both expertly hidden the story of the exodus and monumentally failed to hide Akhenaten's existence. But all either side has is speculation. Ultimately, we can't determine the extent to which the story of Moses is true. It's a matter of faith, not history. In the interest of full disclosure, I do have that faith that the story of Moses has some underlying truth to it and that the events depicted more or less happened. If some new evidence proves it true, I will not need to reform my worldview to accept that. If some new evidence proves it could not possibly have happened as depicted, that will not invoke any crisis of faith in me. I would be fascinated by new understanding, not offended to have my old understanding contradicted. That's not offensive; it's what new evidence is for. ",

            "answer_text": "This is not an answer to the historical accuracy of the Torah, this is a Jewish traditional framework of dealing with it. It is true that our sages and most of the commentaries seemingly treat the Torah as the ultimate history book.The system of values in Judaism, however does not consider historical validity to be a basis for the religion, instead two major values are:The beliefs (see the Jewish principles of faith). This basically, includes the faith in God, uniqueness of the Jewish people and the ultimate everlasting truth of the Torah (to be discussed)The observance (see the 613 commandments ). This includes strict following of the numerous commandments of JudaismTo bring it down to our reality I would compare it to a construction site:We all are the workers,our Rabbis are contractorsour Sages are the architectsour God is the Owner.We firmly believe that the owner knows what He wants, ant the architects did a good job planning everything, and the owner has chosen the best contractors to guide us what to do. The actual story of what we build or why we build it is not relevant.On a deeper level, we have a tradition of mixing the real with the surreal. Just as the Torah says \u201c400 years of slavery\u201d that weren\u2019t actually 400 and many others events that were treated as if they were. In terms of Judaism it doesn\u2019t matter if it was real or theoretical, as long as it fits the theoretical framework, we\u2019re fine with it.This reminds me of a standard model of the atom we were taught at school: We we sure the protons ans electrons were all real. It took year to realize they weren\u2019t. But nobody cares (but some bunch of you know who\u2026). As long as it works and spins it\u2019s fine with us. ",
