            "answer_text": "No one knows for sure but some of the theories are not really possible. For example the Spanish did not attack them or destroy them. There would have been some accounts or records made of that. Plus the colony did not look as though any violence had taken place. The Spanish did not even know where this Colony was located and did not explore the Carolina Coast. The Lost Colony also did not try to return to England. They had no boat to return to England and they were not equipped to build one that could travel across the Ocean. They barely had food and were not used to farming in the New World or hunting. It is almost impossible that they went back on a boat. Basic survival took up all of their time. The Dare Stones\u2014 the Dare Stones were all investigated and ruled to be fakes except for the Original Dare Stone. The other 47 stones were declared to be fake, largely on the use of two words, 'trail' and 'reconnoitre' which were not in the English language for a century or more after 1590. The Original was also not ruled to be authentic. The first stone was reported in 1937 by Louis E. Hammond, who claimed to have found it near the Chowan River. It referred to another stone marking a mass grave which was never found. I personally believe that stone was also a fake because of the circumstances of how it was found and the person who found it. Louis Hammond claimed to be from California and was visiting Chowan County NC by car with his Wife. While looking for Hickory Nuts he found the Original Dare Stone. After Emory University paid Hammond for the stone he disappeared. His Wife was never seen at all. The car he was driving when he found the stone also was never seen. Hammond listed his address as a PO Box in Alameda California. No telephone. An Investigation by Pinkerton found there never was a Man named Louis E. Hammond living in Alameda California or nearby in the 1930s. Hammond was never seen again after Emory University paid him. The 47 other Dare Stones which were fakes all are based on what the Original Dare Stone claimed which was \u201cThe colony after 2 years time had lost many colonists to war and disease and finally the Indians killed all but 7 Colonists.\u201d So if the other 47 stones were fake so was this original stone. The other major problem with the original Dare Stone is the timing of find. August 18, 1937 marked the 350th anniversary of the birth of Virginia Dare. In fact, the Fort Raleigh Historic Site, the state, and town of Manteo were preparing for a visit from then President Franklin Roosevelt on August 18th to mark the anniversary. On the same day, the U.S. Postal Service also released a 5-cent Virginia Dare commemorative stamp. The Fort Raleigh site had received attention during the preceding years as infrastructure developments had brought roads and bridges, at last connecting the island to the mainland of North Carolina. New Deal projects via the Works Progress Administration and the Emergency Relief Administration had helped to build reconstructions of the colonial settlement at the site. And the same year in January, North Carolina playwright Paul Green had been commissioned to dramatize the story of the colonists disappearance, penning the Play \u201cThe Lost Colony.\u201d Green's play opened on July 4,1937 and Roosevelt made his historic visit a little more than a month later. And in November that year, Hammond brings the first Dare Stone to Emory University. So the first Dare Stone appears just as the Lost Colony has received huge National Attention, a Play about it opens and a President visits. It just seems too unbelievable. They were all killed by the Indians. Probably not possible because there were no signs of Violence on Roanoke Island. The Colonists left willingly most likely in need of help and food. There were at least 112 Colonists and evidence has been found to indicate they did not all stay together when they left. Three different sites in North Carolina have artifacts proving some of the Lost Colonists were living there. Therefore reports of the Indians killing all of them seems unlikely. There may also be confusion regarding which Colony is being mentioned. There was a Colony that preceded the Lost Colony known as the Lane Colony. There were hostilities with Indians in the Lane Colony and it was abandoned.Ralph Lane would never return to North America. A relief vessel that arrived with supplies for the Lane Colony was attacked by Indians just 3 days after the Lane Colonists evacuated. They left a detachment of about 15 and sailed themselves for England.Undeterred by the chaos, Sir Walter Raleigh sent John White and a new group of settlers one year later to pick up the so-called \"holding colony\" and to found a new settlement in what is now Virginia. White was unable to find the men left behind, and Indians reported that other natives had attacked the group and forced them to flee by boat. Those 15 men were never heard from again. So reports made that the Lost Colonists were killed by Indians may have referred to Colonists in the Ralph Lane Colony. The Lane Colony did have very serious issues with Indians and had to evacuate after being told by friendly Indians that hostile mainland Indians were coming to kill all of them. However, less than one year after Lane returned to England with Drake, Sir Walter Raleigh would send 118 men, women, and children again to Roanoke Island in his most ambitious attempt yet to establish a lasting English colony.The Lost Colony was not supposed to be located on Roanoke Island. The plan had been to settle a colony on the Chesapeake Bay near what would become Jamestown. The Master and Pilot of the three ship Lost Colony expedition decided to leave them on Roanoke Island instead where the Lane Colony had been located and now abandoned. One Colonist named George Howe was killed by mainland Indians shortly after arrival while walking alone looking for crabs on the Island. His death was depicted in a drawing in a 1901 History Book as follows:  There are no records of any other hostile Indian encounters with the Lost Colonists other than George Howe. Most likely in my view the Lost Colony assimilated into the Indian Population. The word Croatoan was found on a pole. The Colony had been neatly and orderly dismantled and there was no blood or signs of violence. No bodies nor graves were found. Some chests were dug open and the contents thrown on the ground. White thought that Indian scavengers did this after the Colony had been abandoned. The remnants of the Colony slowly disappeared over time. The palisades and even the tree with CRO carved on it disappeared eventually. Today no one really knows where on Roanoke Island the Lost Colony was located for certain. Many speculate that it is in the Water of the Sound as the shoreline receded away. By the time Historians began to look for the Colony location seriously it had already been over 300 years since it was abandoned. The Croatoan were a tribe of Indians that were numerous in Eastern North Carolina. More recently, the Lost Colony Center for Science and Research has initiated the \u2018Lost Colony DNA Project\u2019 to investigate whether the Roanoke settlers did assimilate themselves with the Croatans. Archaeological excavations on the remains of an Indian village at Cape Creek and Pamlico Sound near Cape Hatteras recovered not only artifacts produced by the Indians, but also European trade goods. While this demonstrates that the Croatans were likely to have had contact with the Roanoke settlers, it is not enough to say that the two peoples were assimilated. The Croatans themselves were believed to have become extinct by the early 17th century. Their direct descendants, the Lumbee (who still exist today), began appearing some 50 years after the disappearance of the Roanoke settlers. One of the prominent characteristics of the Lumbee people, as pointed out by observers, is their European features. By 1650, the Lumbee had migrated and settled in Robeson County. Adolph Dial was a Lumbee Indian who was head of the Department of American Indian Studies at Pembroke State University in Pembroke N.C. He was convinced that the Lost Colonists are the ancestors of his 36,000 fellow Lumbees living in what is now Robeson County in southeastern North Carolina. And he believed that he himself was a descendant of Virginia Dare. Precious few details are known about the colony`s most famous citizen. Twenty-seven days after the settlers arrived, she was born to Ananias and Eleanor Dare, who was the daughter of the colony`s governor. On Aug. 24 she was christened ''Virginia'' after the ''virgin queen,'' Elizabeth I. Less than three years later--nobody knows exactly when--the colony disappeared. ''The oral tradition is clear that Virginia Dare`s family survived and that the Dials in Robeson County are her descendants,'' Dial once said in a flat, almost Old English drawl. Oral Traditions in Indian cultures are very powerful and serious. It was a way for Indians to pass along their History and culture to the next generation. Oral Traditions of the Inuits helped solve the fate of the Lost Franklin Expedition in Arctic Canada. Historians for years had not believed the Inuits when they told of White Men on Boats who were starving and resorted to Cannibalism. The Indians claimed to even know the location of the ships but were not taken seriously until recently. Both of the 2 ships of the Lost Franklin Expedition were found where the Inuits said they would be by Canada, Adolph Dial said that''Even today, if you pronounce Dare with the accent people speak here, it sounds very much like Dial.''Not only that,'' Dial continued, ''there are at least 41 names of the lost colonists that are still among our people here in Robeson County--names like Brooks, Berry and Jones.'' Dial said that the carving on the tree is the key that unlocks the mystery of the Lost Colony. Five weeks after the settlers arrived, they persuaded their governor, John White, to go back to England to get provisions. Before White left, he instructed those who remained to signal their whereabouts in case they moved away. They were to carve the name of their new location on a tree. If they left because of some danger, such as an attack by the Indians or the Spanish, they were to add a Maltese cross as a sign of distress. This is a recreation of the tree found at the Fort Raleigh National Historic Site:  As it turned out, it took White three years to return to Roanoke because all of England`s ships were pressed into service against the Spanish Armada. When he finally returned on Aug. 18, 1590--his granddaughter`s third birthday --White found the island deserted: no settlers, no Indians. Buried chests had been dug up and broken open. On a tree near the site he found the word ''CRO''. \u201cCROATOAN\u201d had been carved on a post. There was no Maltese cross. Croatoan was the village of Manteo, an Algonquian Indian who had befriended the colonists. Dial believed that when John White found the carving, he took it to mean the colonists moved to Manteo`s village, about 50 miles to the south, near Cape Hatteras. White never did find them. Back aboard ship, a severe storm prompted the captain, Abraham Cooke, to pull anchor. He meant to sail south and land White at Croatoan, but once clear of the Outer Banks, the ship rode the winds of the storm for days until it was too far out in the Atlantic to return. Cooke set a new course for the Azores, and White, heartbroken, took a last lingering look over the west horizon. He never saw his granddaughter or the other colonists again. Dial speculated that the colonists intermarried with Manteo`s people, moved inland, assimilated with other tribes and eventually settled in what is now Robeson County. Apparently all contact with the settlers` descendants was lost until 1660, when an adventurer named Morgan Jones walked across the Carolinas and was captured and then befriended by Indians who spoke English. From the journals kept by Morgan Jones he was located in what would become Robeson County, North Carolina. Imagine his surprise to find a group of Indians who could speak English fluently in 1660 almost 100 miles from the coastline of the New World.The area of North Carolina Morgan Jones was in did not have any European settlements in 1660. So how did these Indians know how to speak English? Jones observed that some of these Indians had blond hair and blue or gray eyes. They claimed to have had English heritage and an affinity for England. 70 years had passed since the Lost Colony had vanished when Morgan Jones met these English speaking Indians. Thus it is likely He was speaking to grandchildren or great grand children of the Lost Colonists and not to the Colonists themselves. Morgan noted that the Indians he met were all under 30 years of age and virile and strong. There is a record of Jones` letter in a newspaper account of it published in 1840 in the Charleston Gazette. In the 1730s, the first big wave of Scottish immigrants reached the Cape Fear Valley. When they arrived they were astonished to find a group of English-speaking people already living there in European-type homes and tilling the soil in the European fashion. Many of them were blue-eyed and blond-haired, just like many of the Lumbees today.' Through the centuries, Dial claimed, the two cultures had integrated so completely that they developed extraordinary speech patterns, passing along the English language in a form that was spoken in the 16th Century. ''I don`t know it to be a fact,'' Dial once said. ''But I firmly believe the descendants of the Lost Colony are right here in Robeson County. If I were a betting man, I`d give it all kinds of odds.'' Here is a photo of a Lumbee Indian with blue eyes taken during WWII:  I believe like Dial that the Lumbee Indians are descended from the Lost Colony. ",

            "answer_text": "Roanoke Colony is the first attempt made by the English to establish a colony in North America. And probably one of the first mysteries in the American history. This colony was established in what is now Dare County in North Carolina. It is also called as the Lost Colony since the people of this colony left missing without any trace. It was actually established in 1585 by Sir Walter Raleigh but was abandoned in 1586 because of lack of food and attacks by the native Americans, leaving 15 people in the colony to protect Raleigh\u2019s claim to the colony. Another expedition by Sir Walter Raleigh was dispatched to Roanoke Colony with a group of 115 colonists. This expedition was actually sent to establish a colony in Chesapeake Bay and also to find the 15 men left in Roanoke. The leader was John White, who became the governor of the colony. But they couldn\u2019t find anything other than some remains of the colony. So, using the remains, they built a new colony there. Eleanor White, the daughter of John White and Ananias Dare had a daughter, Virginia Dare, named after her birthplace, Virginia, on 18 August 1587. She became the first English child to be born in American land and quite became a legend. The governor John White left for England for supplies. But he couldn\u2019t return because of the Anglo-Spanish war which was going on primarily on the Atlantic Ocean. When he returned back in 1590, he found that the colonists had left. They found a word \u201cCROATOAN\u201d carved into a wooden post. And since the houses and the fortifications were found dismantled, the departure of the colonists was not a hurried one. So there are many theories surrounding this mysterious mass departure. Theory 1: They assimilated into the native population who were in the Croatoan Island which is south of Roanoke. Theory 2: They were attacked and killed by the Spanish. Theory 3: They tried to sail back to England in a desperate measure for supplies only to be killed midway by the harsh seas or by the Spanish navy. Theory 4: Dare Stones: A series of messages were found between 1937\u20131941, allegedly written by Eleanor White describes what happened to the colonists. But they were declared as forgeries because they contradicted each other. This mass disappearance of colonists became one of the biggest mysteries in the American history and is yet to be solved. In 2007, a project named \u201cThe Lost Colony of Roanoke DNA Project\u201d was founded to solve the mystery by using DNA testing and historical records. There are similar parallel projects for solving the mystery and let\u2019s hope they solve this mystery. ",
