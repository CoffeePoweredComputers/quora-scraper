            "answer_text": "The krona began to fall in value against the euro and the dollar at the end of 2016. Some are pleased, but more are worried. In the long term, a weak krone erodes the purchasing power and prosperity of the Swedes Swedish monetary policy has hampered the krona\u2019s strength. Sweden\u2019s interest rates stuck below zero since 2015 and. But why is the krona so weak? There are several reasons, but one big bow in the drama is the Riksbank's pursuit of inflation. Inflation is when the price of goods and services rises. And a reasonable inflation rate, or price increase, acts as a kind of fuel for the economy. The Riksbank therefore has a target for inflation of 2 per cent - but has long had difficulty achieving it.In the past, inflation increased as wages rose - people could buy more things and traders could pay more. But the economy is no longer working as before. Sure, wages are increasing, but not at the same rate. The Riksbank must therefore find something else that can get inflation going - and this is where the value of the krone comes in. - By the fall of the krona, imports simply become more expensive. That is, prices of imports are rising and then you can reach the inflation target, says Sandro Scocco, chief economist at Arena Idea.What the Riksbank has done is to keep its policy rate, and thus the interest rate situation in large, extremely low. This means that those who buy Swedish kronor receive no return. Interest is, as you know, the price of money. The reason for the Riksbank's actions is that it tries to raise inflation to its target, ie around 2 per cent per year. The Riksbank's tool for reaching the target and accelerating inflation is the interest rate. The Swedish Riksbank interest rate is still at minus and it is now lower than that of the European Central Bank. If the Riksbank raises interest rates, the krona would strengthen - but the risk is then that inflation will stop. - If we are to reach two per cent inflation today, we simply cannot afford a stronger krona, says Sandro Scocco. In practice, a weak krona leads to Swedish goods becoming cheaper abroad, while imported goods become more expensive in Sweden. Thus, Swedes can afford to buy less at home, and foreign stays become more expensive. Swedish industry is doing like its competitors in Germany and suddenly slows down. Swedbank / Silf's purchasing manager index falls 5.5 percentage points to 46.3. The krona falls hard against both the euro and the dollar after the unexpectedly weak index. This is the biggest decline since the fall of 2008, when the Lehman Brothers crash hit the financial market. At the same time, the new level is the lowest since the days of the euro crisis, in early 2013.Persistent decline An index number below 50 indicates decreased activity in the sector. \"The decline in September was broad, where three out of five sub-indices in PMI total were listed below the 50 mark. Sub-indices for production and order intake accounted for the largest monthly declines and contributed a total of 4.2 index units to the decrease in PMI total,\" Swedbank writes / Silf. At the same time, a gloomy forecast comes from the Industrial Employers, who after the summer see a clear slowdown in the Swedish base industry. \"The mood is worse than normal in the forest industry and much worse than normal in the steel and metal industries,\" writes the Industry Employers in a press release which says they expect a Swedish growth of 1.2 percent this year and 1.1 percent in 2020, and that unemployment in Sweden rises to 7.5 percent in 2020. The decline in purchasing managers' index from Swedbank / Silf was unexpected. Analysts had, on average, calculated an index of 52. At the same time, a number of sub-indices indicate that there is a sustained decline for the manufacturing industry we see taking shape, according to Nordea economist Torbj\u00f6rn Isaksson. He points out how both the sub-index for production and the sub-index for order intake fall sharply, to 43.4 and 45.7 respectively. \"In the end, the weak global economy will have a clearer effect on the Swedish manufacturing industry. Swedish manufacturers are simply moving in the same direction as, for example, the German ones,\" he writes in a comment. The crown falls The consequences will be low growth and restrained wage growth, believes Isaksson, who believes that the development will force the Riksbank to lower the key rate around the turn of the year. The Riksbank itself has been flagging since the last interest rate meeting for an increase in the policy rate at the turn of the year. The krona loses against both the dollar and the euro after the unexpectedly weak index. Against the euro, the decline is seven kroner to SEK 10:78 per euro, against the dollar it is a decrease of eight kroner to SEK 9:90 per dollar. Kronan faller och Sverige med den?

            "answer_text": "In Sweden there are 2 different views on this as far as I know. The first. It is the to aggressive actions taken by the central bank in an attempt to keep the inflation at 2%. And indeed Sweden like other countries are struggeling to keep the inflation at 2%. Unfortunately for the central bank the causes arent just interest rates. For one thing Sweden has a really high unemployment rate that stubbornly has refused to go down more than 1% at only certain times during the last 20\u201325 years. This of course means that a huge group of people cant spend as much as they otherwise could. And contrarty to earlier years Sweden is starting to have a wider gap between those with a little more money and the low paid workers. As a result MANY swedes goes abroad and spend their money, keeping consumption lower here and weakening the currency as they buy foreign currency increasing the supply of swedish currency on the market (which lowers the value). Also the problems causing low inflation isnt something that the central bank can solve, it takes political reforms and sadly we have had a period of very few reforms or babystep reforms. So the central bank then finds itself in a difficult position, they must try to keep inflation up, but the best way to do that is political reforms, meaning the central bank has to be even more aggressive to compensate when we have few reforms. The second opinion, which I personally agree with, claims that the actions of the central bank has nothing to do with the weaker currency. Most people claim it is the minus interest rate that the central bank currently use that is the cause. HOWEVER as the central bank rightly points out even countries with a lot higher interest rates are also having falling currency rates. The reason for this has its origin in the financial crisis in Europe = the Eurocrisis where a few mostly smaller countries suddenly had difficulties paying their loans and a crashing economy as a result. When that happend the currency market saw huge movements when investers got more carefull and started looking for \u201c\u201dsafer\u201d\u201d currencies. Sweden and some other smaller countries were believed to be REALLY stable countries = not to many loans compared to our GDP and strong government finances meaning we most likely would be able to keep our payments even if we would see rising interestrates as well. As a result our currency suddenly started to strengthen rapidly. Now a few years has passed since the crisis and the market has realized that many inverstors are really carefull, abandonning smaller currencies at the first sign of trouble. Norway is an example. This told other investors that smaller currencies were at risk of huge sudden movements and investors started to swift from smaller currnecies, even in stable countries, to larger currencies, were it would take really huge movements to bring down the currency. The 2nd view can be proven by looking at the reality of the market and therefore in my opinion at least is the correct view. But of course it wouldnt be bad IF Sweden had more reforms, which should lower the pressure on the central bank to act more aggressive. But things are as they are and since the politicans refuse to make a move the central bank has to compensate for this and even if the overall market movements are the cause more aggressive actions probably increase the effects on the currency. But it wouldnt really matter as the reality has shown when countries with higher interest rates still experience a weakening currency. At least that is my take on this =) ",
