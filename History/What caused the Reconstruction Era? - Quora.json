            "answer_text": "Thank for the A2A! It was caused by the deconstruction of the Constitution immediately before it. The Constitution: is an international compact among nine or more nation-states, whichestablished the voters of each ratifying nation-state, as the final authority therein. Andit did not unite the states as a single nation-state; but each state remained a separate nation-state unto itself.This fact was suppressed by a continental coup of censorship and mass-murder during the Lincoln Administration, which established Totalitarian Democracy and Crony Capitalism under a rogue empire. So \u201cReconstruction\u201d referred to re-establishment under a New Order of oligarchs who supplanted true democracy with limited plebiscite, and called that \u201cconsent to government.\u201d  REALITY: US Constitution, article V: The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate. So Lincoln\u2019s phrase \u201cthe People,\u201d actually refers to the the government. However this is not how the Constitution was adopted among the states, contrary to Lincoln\u2019s claim that: The Union is much older than the Constitution. It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774. It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was further matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation in 1778. And finally, in 1787, one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution was \"to form a more perfect Union. REALITY: The Constitution established a new Union of sovereign nation-states, each unilaterally seceding as a sovereign nation from the prior Union formed under the Articles of Confederation, in order to ratify the Constitution. Even when admitting this, however: Lincoln-apologists sloppily attempt to claim that the Constitution united the individual American nation-states as a single nation-state; however this is purely a fabrication of junk-historians.  Consider even the very words: We the People of the United States\u2026 do ordain and establish the Constitution for the United States of America\u201d Clearly, when admitting that \u201cthe People of the United States\u201d were separate peoplesof separate nation-states,prior to the Constitution; \u2026then this sentence clearly does NOT expressly manifest any intent to unite them into a single nation-state and people. Particularly when only nine of the original 13 nation-states were required in order to carry the new Union into effect between them, as noted in Article VII: Rather, the Unionist position depends entirely on circular logic of confirmation-bias. Thus, t Unionists use the phrase \u201cThe People of the United States\u201d to try to refer to a single people and nation. clinging to the dogmatic propaganda created by Unionists themselves, to claim that the USA was a single nation\u2026 no matter how fuzzy the facts. Here\u2019s the crown jewel of backpedaling, by Prof. Akhil Reed Amar of Yale Law School: In dramatic contrast to Article VII\u2013whose unanimity rule that no state can bind another confirms the sovereignty of each state prior to 1787 \u2013 Article V does not permit a single state convention to modify the federal Constitution for itself. Moreover, it makes clear that a state may be bound by a federal constitutional amendment even if that state votes against the amendment in a properly convened state convention. And this rule is flatly inconsistent with the idea that states remain sovereign after joining the Constitution, even if they were sovereign before joining it. Thus, ratification of the Constitution itself marked the moment when previously sovereign states gave up their sovereignty and legal independence. Somebody should tell this \u201cConstitutional Law Professor\u201d about International Law. Then he might learn that when nation-states \u201cconsent to be bound\u201d by an international compact,without expressly uniting as a single nation-state,they remain separate nations; i.e. is no over-arching compulsory judicial system or coercive penal system to address breaches of the provisions, or to settle disputes.

            "answer_text": "1865\u201377\u2014 Reconstruction under Abraham Lincoln The original Northern objective in the civil War was the preservation of the Union\u2014a war aim with which virtually everybody in the free states agreed. As the fighting progressed, the Lincoln government concluded that emancipation of the slaves was necessary in order to secure military victory; and thereafter freedom became a second war aim for the members of the Republican party The more radical members of that party\u2014men like Charles Sumner and Thaddeus Stevens\u2014believed that emancipation would prove a sham unless the government guaranteed the civil and political rights of the freedmen\u2014thus, equality of all citizens before the law became a third war aim for this powerful faction. The fierce controversies of the Reconstruction era raged over which of these objectives should be insisted upon and how these goals should be secured. The national debate over Reconstruction began during the Civil War. In December 1863\u2014President Abraham Lincoln announced the first comprehensive-program for Reconstruction\u2014the Ten Percent Plan\u2014when one-tenth of a state\u2019s prewar voters took an oath of loyalty, they could establish a new state government. To Lincoln, the plan was an attempt to weaken the Confederacy rather than a blueprint for the postwar South. It was put into operation in parts of the Union-occupied Confederacy, but none of the new governments achieved broad local support. In 1864 Congress enacted the Wade-Davis Bill\u2014which proposed to delay the formation of new Southern governments until a majority of voters had taken a loyalty oath. Some Republicans were already convinced that equal rights for the former slaves had to accompany the South\u2019s readmission to the Union. In his last speech, on April 11, 1865, Lincoln, referring to Reconstruction in Louisiana\u2014 expressed the view that some blacks\u2014the \u201cvery intelligent\u201d and those who had served in the Union army\u2014ought to enjoy the right to vote.
