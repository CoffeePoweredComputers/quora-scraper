            "answer_text": "A few reasons:  Photos are not scalable. As Steve\u2019s answer pointed out, photos don\u2019t do well at small sizes. Ever try to pick between thumbnails? A favicon is about 32px x 32px.  Photos have limits to how they can be sent, shared, attached, viewed. They have color modes to operate in, CMYK, RGB. They look different in different forms, and the forms that make them look the best aren\u2019t the ones that people use the most often. Your logo will never look the same from one format to the next as a photo.  In fact, it is widely discouraged to even use JPGs to share logos, as that is the traditional format for saving photos and it is not always compatible with web applications.  Photos are difficult to print when they are logos. A print with one color takes much much less money than a print with 2 colors, and a fraction of what a full color photo takes.  To get around this process where there are gradients or multiple colors, they use black and white versions of a logo. Photos with many many colors often don\u2019t translate well to black and white, and can look very raw and unprofessional.  A photo is also not recognizable as a company or logo. When people see a logo, they associate it with business. They unconsciously take the logo owner more seriously. A photo does not necessarily have this same connotation, and can mean unprofessional. In point, if you just saw that green apple, would you know it was Apple Corps? The Beatles recording studio? No. In short, photos weren\u2019t meant to be logos, and they don\u2019t technically work well as logos. Because of this culturally they also do not translate to logos and can send the wrong message instead of convey one. ",

            "answer_text": "Photos don\u2019t scale or convert to black and white well. Vectors are mathematical representations of lines, so scaling perfectly without limit is of their essence. Photos, or more generally, raster images, are a specific quantity of pixels arranged as rows and column of pixel, or dots. When one scales a photo down, the process requires discarding data (pixels) and guessing (interpolating) how the remaining dots should appear (typically) based on a complex algorithm, e.g., bicubic. When enlarging a raster image, the algorithm must necessarily create new information and guess (interpolate) how the remaining dots should appear (typically) based on a complex algorithm, e.g., bicubic. A significant concomitant of enlarging/reducing is a softening of what the raster represents. The logo very quickly looks bad. Then, when one adds clients to the mix, the enlargement or reduction is iterated and stacked. By this I mean that the client takes the original, and, say, reduces the size of it by half (looks like dog poo now). Then, then the next day, they need something twice as big as the original, so they take the reduced image and enlarge it to 400%, and at this point the logo is unrecognizable and they\u2019re pissed at the designer. Ask me how I know. Photographs are used as logos by rank amateurs without any understanding of how graphics work or how clients work. ",
