            "answer_text": "There was this Polish poet of Jewish origin, Julian Tuwim, one of the greatest masters of Polish language in history. Before the war he was often attacked in nationalistic press, because of his origin and because of his leftist views. During the German occupation of Poland he wandered around the world. On emigration he wrote his opus magnum, epic poem \u201cKwiaty Polskie\u201d. (\u201cThe Flowers of Poland\u201d). There he wrote: \u201cMy country is my home\u201dOjczyzna jest mym domemMnie w udziele dom polski przypad\u0142, to ojczyznaA inne kraje s\u0105 hotele What in my clumsy translation means: \u201cMy contry is my home\u201dMy country [fatherland] is my homeMe, in my legacy, a Polish home was granted, that\u2019s the fatherlandAnd other countries are just hotels He also wrote a letter to his mother, about whom he did not know if she was still alive. The letter\u2019s title is \u201cWe, Polish Jews\u201d. That\u2019s its fragment: However, if I did ever have to justify my nationality, or rather my national feelings, then I would say I am a Pole for the simplest, almost the most primitive of reasons, generally rational, frequently irrational, but without a 'mystical' addition. To be a Pole, it is neither an honor, nor glory, nor a privilege. It is the same as breathing. I have not yet met a person that is proud of the fact that he breathes. A Pole - because I was born in Poland, grew up, was educated, taught, because it was in Poland that I was happy and unhappy, because from my exile I necessarily want to return to Poland, though they may promise me Paradisiacal delights elsewhere. A Pole - because through a loving superstition which no reasoning or logic can explain, I desire that after my death, it shall be Polish soil that will absorb and consume me and none other. A Pole - because that is what I was told in Polish in my family home; because I was suckled on the Polish language as a newborn, because my mother taught me Polish poems and songs, and when my first great poetic tremor came, it was in Polish words, because all that, which became most important in life - poetic creativity - is unimaginable in any other language, no matter how fluently I may speak it. A Pole - because it was in Polish that I confessed my first love and its' fears, and it was Polish in which I sobbed of its joys and storms. A Pole also because the birch and the willow are closer to me than a cypress or a palm, and Mickiewicz and Chopin dearer than Shakespeare and Beethoven. Dearer for reasons that no reasoning can justify. A Pole - because I have absorbed a certain number of their national faults. A Pole - because my hatred of Polish Fascists is greater than of Fascists of other nationalities. Moreover, I believe this to be a major trait of my Polishness. But above all - a Pole because it pleases me. The Tuwim\u2019s words are for me the most beautiful declaration of patriotism, as opposed to nationalism. In Polish language it is a difference much more distinctive than in many other tongues. I always cry when I read his words. They define what makes me a Pole. They defines what makes me, a scion of many generations of Polish nobility, dating back to the fourteenth century, a compatriot, and a spiritual scion, of Tuwim \u2013 a Polish Jew. Who doesn\u2019t understand that for us Poles, of all imaginable origins, be it Polish, Jewish, Lithuanian, German, Tatar, Turkish, Armenian, Ruthenian, whatever, patriotism \u2013 love of ones own country and of own compatriots is a quite different thing than nationalism \u2013 considering yourself better that people of different origin, they understand nothing of Poland, Polish people and our historical and present problems. So, for those who do not understand this I have this one answer: Polish Jews returned to Poland after the WW II because they were Polish nationalists. ",

            "answer_text": "They considered themselves Polish. Take my great aunt Sophie. She left Poland with her husband shortly before the outbreak of WWII. I don\u2019t know the details, but it appears it was more his desire than hers. They moved to France, which appeared to be a fortuitous decision given the events of 1939. But then, of course, less than a year later France was overrun and they found themselves in peril anyway. Her husband was rounded up and sent to a labor camp from which he never returned. My great aunt joined the resistance, and did what she could against the Nazis, surviving the war. After the war, with no family in France, and seeing herself as Polish, she returned there, although almost her entire family had been wiped out. Nonetheless, she was a very smart and industrious woman, and found employment in the Polish government, where she worked through the 1950s until 1968. Then because she was a Jew, she was forced to emigrate again, in the so-called political crisis of 1968, when the Polish government under the rationale of \u201canti-Zionism\u201d (following Israel\u2019s victory in the 1967 War) basically forced what Jews were left in the country out. My aunt moved back to France with a bunch of other Polish Jews and lived for the rest of her life in Grasse (the perfume capital of France about 15km north of Cannes.) An indomitable woman, she maintained an apartment on a hillside from which she walked to and from the town well into her 80s. I met her several times. She maintained close ties to her Polish Jewish friends. They talked Polish among themselves, French to the French, and German with me, since it was our only common language. Despite the war and the history of Jews in Poland, she would have happily stayed there, had the Poles let her. ",
