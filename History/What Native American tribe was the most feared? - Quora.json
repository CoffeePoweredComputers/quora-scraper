            "answer_text": "Interesting question - the answer probably is best determined at WHAT TIME PERIOD AND WHERE we refer to\u2026 In Jamestown Virginia, war broke out in 1622 with the Powhatan Indians, so at that time and place, the Powhatans were the most feared. After the European settlers came to the New England region of America, conflict broke out in the 1670\u2019s with the Wampanoag Indians. \u201cKing Philip\u2019s War\u201d killed over 350 settlers, so at that time the Wampanoag held the crown as the most feared. This was the pattern - as white settlers moved ever westward, they collided and conflicted with localized tribes who defended their land, and in the process the tribes became the most feared at that time and place. During the 1750\u2019s tribes such as the Mohawks of New York were feared. In 1778, British and Iroquois massacred over 300 settlers in the Wyoming Valley of NE Pennsylvania. During the early 1800\u2019s the combined forces of the Creek, Cherokee, and Choctaws were feared along the Ohio Valley. In the Great Plains, larger tribes such as the Cheyenne and Sioux were feared, in the Colorado Mountains it was the Arapaho, while in Texas, settlers feared the Comanches during the 1830- 60s, and in Arizona, Apaches were feared in the 1860\u201370s. BOTTOM LINE: where ever a settler\u2019s family was living at the time, did they have a good rapport with the local indigenous tribe? If not, then THAT was the Native American tribe THEY feared most. It was never a contest of the \u201cscariest tribe of all time\u201d, but rather who at that time and place was most likely to try to kill YOU. In nearly all of these situations, whites brought most of the troubles on themselves by usually stomping on Indian traditions and taking the land that had been traditional homes to these tribes for generations, with NO offer to compensate for the taking of the land. From another perspective - if some group took YOUR home away - along with those of your neighbors - would you and your neighbors be pissed off enough to pick up rifles and start shooting trespassers, as well as start hunting down the thieves? If the answer is \u2018yes\u2019, then (locally) you and your neighbors are now the most feared \u2018tribe\u2019\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on which part of the country (I am sticking with the US and Northern Mexico.) In the Northern Plains of the US and South Central Canada the Lakota/Dakota/Sioux were large aggressive and well organized. When they were pushed out of the area of the Great Lakes by tribes with guns traded from the French and British fur traders. They set out to organize, trade for guns for themselves and conquered an empire taking in all or part of what are several states/provinces in the US and Canada. To the south of them the Comanche earned the title \u201cFinest Light Cavalry in the World\u201d from some experts. It was said that 100 Shield Age Comanche could defeat any similar size force in the plains. The Apache earned a ferocious reputation from West Texas to New Mexico to Arizona and into Northern Mexico. Yet there is a story that when a group of Apache raided a town of the Yaqui in Mexico the Yaqui organized an army, tracked the warriors of the raiding party to some Apache Villages along the US Mexican border and basically wiped the villages out. Sending the message \u201cDon\u2019t mess with us.\u201d It is said the Apache as a tribe made it a point to leave the Yaqui alone. The Yaqui had in large part adapted a European life style, towns, farms, ranches, churches etc. And as recently as the mid 20th century even Mexican government officials only went into Yaqui towns by invitation or with an Army escort.
