            "answer_text": "The \u201cfast draw\u201d was basically fiction that came out of the Wild West Shows of the late 1880 - 1900 period. There were of course gunfighters but they did not stand out in the street and challenge one another to see who could draw faster. The very few such gunfights came from the old European custom of the duel and were carried out by gentlemen rather than common criminals. But of course that did not sell newspapers back east or make for good dime novels. Most real gunslingers were outlaws or just a very few of the lawmen and even some of them were outlaws at one time. But the average \u201clawman\u201d was fairly up in age and had another real time job or profession. (One only need to look at the old US Census to see this.) Many were just farmers or ranchers. When a \u201cbad guy\u201d came around the local lawman just deputized a large group of younger men and they hunted down the bad guys and killed them like mad dogs anyway the could. Most County Sheriff preferred the sawed-off shotgun for close quarters work and the carbine at any distance. Those who did use pistols generally preferred longer barrels for the extra range that it gave them. Criminals on the other hand often used what ever they could get their hands on at the moment. While gunfights certainly occurred, they were more like running gun battles or even ambushes. The famous Gunfight at the OK Corral is a prime example.Accuracy was far more important than speed in most but not all of these. This sort of law enforcement carried over well into the early 1900s and one only need to look a the car of Bonny Parker & Clyde Barrow to see how the law dealt with the criminal element.  They were not \u201casked\u201d to stop. They were not given a \u201cfair chance\u201d. No Miranda warning or \u201clet\u2019s see your hands\u201d for killers back then. Just as had been done for a century before this, they were ambushed and killed like the mad-dog killers that they were. That was just the way things really happened throughout the 1800s and even into the early 1900s. Much has been written of \u201cgunslingers\u201d in modern days but their \u201cfacts\u201d tend to come from old eastern newspapers and dime novels that were highly exaggerated to make their stories sellers. You need to read the diaries and writings of the citizens who were there to get the real stories. But, that won\u2019t make for good copy and sell. Gunslingers & outlaws were brought back and put on public display by laying them out on the sidewalk or tying (or nailing) their dead bodies onto a board or door and standing them up. On rare occasions they were tied or nailed in their coffins so that it could be stood up and put on display for all to see.  Most of the Dalton Gang 1892 (above)  Ned Christie ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s only consistently the 4.75\u2033 barrel on an 1873 Colt Single Action Army revolver in western fiction, especially movies and television as those are the fastest for the actors to draw (albeit with the aid of film editing so it looks far quicker than it actually is) and of course they don\u2019t have to hit targets or aim, that\u2019s what the special effects technicians will take care of. Real gunfighters used the full range of barrel lengths from 9\u2033 on the Colt 1860 Army, the 1851 Colt Navy that so many gunfighters started with including Wild Bill Hickock, Doc Holliday, John Wesley Hardin, Jesse James, etc., the 7.5\u2033 Colt 1873 SAA and 1875 Remington Army were used by many more real gunfighters than the 4.75\u2033 as it\u2019s much more accurate and potent (20%+), the 7\u2033 Smith & Wesson and Merwin Hulbert big revolvers that many preferred to the Colts, as well as 4\u2033-2\u2033 bulldog revolvers in big calibers and .38\u2019s & .32\u2019s medium and small revolvers that were much more commonly used by gunfighters (Doc Holliday, Billy the Kid, Pat Garrett, John Wesley Hardin, John Selman, etc.) than is usually noted. Real gunfighters were frequently trying different makes, models, barrel lengths, double action as well as single action, different cartridges as many new ones emerged in that period like .38\u201340 WCT, .32\u201320 WCF, .38 Colt Long, S&W .44 Russian, .44 MH, .41 Colt, .450 Webley, etc.. and many started with percussion cap and lead ball revolvers like the Colt 1851 or Colt 1848 Dragoon with 9\u2033 barrels. Quick draw is vastly overstated, concealed carry was more significant as was not snagging the pistol\u2019s front sight on a belt, pants waistband, holster, coat pocket, etc. as was snagging the hammer on apparel and pockets a common problem. It does take slightly longer to draw a long barrel although more practice alleviates much of that, but a substantially more accurate shot by a long-barreled revolver is a reliable result and that made the difference in most real gunfights, then and now.
