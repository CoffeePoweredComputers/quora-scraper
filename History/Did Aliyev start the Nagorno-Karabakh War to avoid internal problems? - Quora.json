            "answer_text": "I would say NO. It is outdated argument that Armenians bring. There are multiple reasons and contra-arguments that Aliyev could bring. Pashinyan triggered Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis by saying \u2018Karabakh is Armenia\u2019. Subsequently, Pashinyan organized presidential elections in so-called Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. All of these are disrespect to Azerbaijan, Azerbaijanis and international law not to Aliyev only. Even hardcore opposition parties condemned Aliyev for his inaction. It was fatal error that Pashinyan could ever do as a PM of Armenia. Now he pays for it.Reserves of Central Bank of Azerbaijan 37 billion USD in 2015 and 50 billion USD in 2019. In Armenia it\u2019s 2.6 billion USD. I would not say Azerbaijan was facing severe financial problems before the war.Global pandemic could easily be excuse for Aliyev to acquit financial problems. It is global problem.Military budget of Azerbaijan is ~2 billion USD and it is equal to state budget of Armenia. Azerbaijan can easily prolong the war for 3 months with Armenia and face no any financial problem in return.Aliyev was pushed by Azerbaijanis, local political parties to solve the Karabakh issue and not to wait so long.

            "answer_text": "It is normal to see that question since 26 September because Armenian propaganda service came up with \u201cthis idea\u201d to destablize Azerbaijanis and take advantage over Azerbaijani Army and politics. Armenian Lobbies made their works well spread wide, but not intelligent way. In June and July (as usual as always) Armenian occupation army broke ceasefire and started shelling on Tovuz. The place is away from Nagorno-Karabakh Armenia has a claim.  As a result, Major general Polad Hashimov and some senior officers were martyred, which ended Azerbaijanis patience. Many protests started and they called \u201cthe end of occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh and 7 districts around\u201d.  Major General Polad Hashimov below  image from Azerbaijani Major General Polad Hashimov martyred in Armenian provocation laid to rest  Now on from the latest attack by Armenia in 26 September, people from every different political fractions and their followers - almost all of Azerbaijanis support Azerbaijani Army and Ilham Aliev until full liberation of the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. He is not just the president, also Commander-in-chief. Preparation of supplies from civils :  She also lost her two sons in Karabakh War and now wants to send \u201cher saved money for burial\u201d to support fund of Azerbaijani Army :  That man was retired and sent more than half of his pension to support fund of Azerbaijani Army:  I can list a lot of examples here how much we love and support our army and want to win this war.
