            "answer_text": "Since the last war in which war was actually declared was WW II, I will answer for that war. (Please be more specific next time!) However, I will add one additional crucial thing: control of mass media. I have several reasons, and one is sure to be unpopular, despite being true. First, we were still very much suffering from the Great Depression. Our factories were in very poor repair and the skills of the workers were atrophied from lack of use. To ramp up quickly (particularly to manufacture things outside their usual range of expertise or experience) meant that the companies need help. Second, while there was still a great throbbing of nationalistic fervor, the government needed to ensure that profit-taking was minimal, and that is intrusive. The US Treasury was operating at a colossal deficit and waste was simply unacceptable. Third, many skilled workers and highly skilled professionals had enlisted, draining companies of the skill sets that they needed, just when they were needed the most. Fourth, the transportation sector was still transitioning from mainly rail to substantially trucked. And driving was not yet something that just everyone knew how to do. In truth, driving was a very skilled job, since the trucks were very, very underpowered, uncomfortable, and prone to breakdown. Fifth, the U-boat raids had cut off the US from critical supplies, notably rubber. Tires were, at that time, of exceptionally poor quality by today\u2019s standards, and the roads were seldom paved. Finally, Fascism was popular in the United States. Americans viewed the rise of Fascism in Europe, and saw nations explode from crippled and crushed entities into shiny and flashy new nations, freshly scrubbed and fairly glowing with apparent health and strength. It seemed reasonable to adopt some of the practices of Fascism in order to win the war. Now Fascism was sold under the brand of \u201cEfficiency\u201d, and true efficiency was certainly needed. Since we couldn\u2019t actually enact Fascism per se, we effected martial efficiency - the control of the economy, transportation, and trade by the government (which is very, very Fascist), and giving general direct authority for contract negotiations to the military. This is not a bad idea, given that the people with experience negotiating and managing contracts were overwhelmingly in uniform now, Furthermore, Fascism (including eugenics) had been extremely popular among the American elites, including managers and bosses, of course. And the American Government rolled out the propaganda. If you look at the propaganda of America and compare it to the propaganda of the Fascists, there is actually precious little difference. Keep in mind, that Americans were very, very motivated to go to work after a decade of Great Depression, and so was everyone else. everything was in place for high production. But there was a difference:  Pervitin was available to everyone in Germany. Pervitin is well-known in America, but it was far less available in America. Pervitin is methamphetamine. ",

            "answer_text": "In war time far more of the national wealth has to be diverted into arms and munitions that would be in peace time - in terms of a world war many times over That means strategic materials (metalsm rubber, Oil, ect) that cannot be sourced domestically have to be purchased in increase quantities (compared to peace time) That means where industry uses strategic materials for things that do form part of the war effort find themselves in competition with war production, so the government has to make a choice - Consumer Goods or War Materials - there is only one winner there! Transport become strategically important because not only have the increase in strategic materials got to be transported to factories from ports but war materials supplied to fighting forces usually miles ways from the most direct supply route and of course the enemy will be trying to disrupt those supplies ",
