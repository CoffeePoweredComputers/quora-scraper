            "answer_text": "The soldiers on both sides had two main kinds of food: camp rations and march rations. In camp, the men ate rations that would have included oat meal or grits, bacon, eggs, fresh breads, roasted beef, pork, beans, canned or dehydrated vegetables, and soups. On the march, Northern troops would have nine three inch by three inch hard tack crackers and three slaps of salted fork, along with coffee beans and brown sugar. Confederate rations had the same salted pork, but also a bag of cornmeal that's they would make a biscuit out of, using the fat from the fried salted pork and water into what was called a \u201cJohnny Cake.\u201d Troops on both sides would add whatever food they could while on the march. Since combat was reasonably infrequent, most of the diet was camp food. During the Sieges of Vicksburg and Petersburg, Union troops on the front lines tended to have camp food brought forward to them. Conversely, Southern rations tended to decline as food supplies dwindled. One of the reasons Southern desertion rates increased towards the end of the War was that the South could not readily feed its troops and many Southern soldiers preferred living to starvation. ",

            "answer_text": "Union soldiers lived on hardtack, salt pork, and coffee. Occasionally they would get rice, and a form of dried vegetables called \u201cdesecrated\u201d vegetables by the men. They also got sugar rations. They foraged extensively meaning living off of the land, the most famous instance being Sherman\u2019s march from Atlanta to Savannah. Confederate soldiers ate corn bread and beef. The corn meal was often of poor quality and had the cob ground with the kernel. They also had field peas and goober peas or peanuts. They could not get coffee due to the blockade. Chicory was substituted, but Confederate soldiers traded tobacco to Union soldiers for coffee when they could. Generally the Union had more consistent rations than their Confederate counterparts but not always. Supply lines were sometimes disrupted by Confederate Cavalry raids and the \u201ccracker line\u201d was disrupted. ",
