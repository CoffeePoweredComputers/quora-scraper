Charminar Tunnel, Hyderabad \u2013 Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah had built a tunnel that connected the Golconda fort with the Charminar. The royal family probably used the tunnel as an emergency exit route. A survey of the tunnel conducted by archeology department in 1936 found 30ft to 40ft deep tunnels within the main tunnel. The result of this survey hints at hidden treasures in the tunnel. However, the findings of this survey were never followed up.

            "answer_text": " The Padbhanabha Swamy Temple, Thiruvananthapuram , Kerala This temple has a one trillion dollar hidden treasure chamber. Also, it is one of the richest temples in the world. The temple has six vaults, or kallaras ( Vaults A, B, C, D, E and F) inside the Sreekovil. Two more have been identified recently. The vaults contain gold and precious stones valued at several lakh crores of rupees. Where did it all come from? Mainly through offerings to the temple, gifts received by the king or submission by the king of a part of the state revenues, historians say. Submitting gold or properties to the temple seemed to be a norm in the past. Records indicate rulers having gifted vast tracts of land, agricultural lands and gardens to the temple from A.D 1179. Below the surface, deep underground lie chambers filled with treasure. Vaults C-F have been opened periodically., while A was opened in 2011 upon Supreme court\u2019s orders. But Vault B has a different story.  Vault B According to TheHindu report, Vault B has been currently under discussion in the SC - was also opened on that occasion but access was blocked by a thick metal door resembling that of a strong room. The Varmas, the former royal family of Travancore, now part of the modern state of Kerala have strongly opposed in opening Vault B as \u201c They believe death will visit them if Kallara B would be opened\u201d. No one has dared to touch the door. It still remains a mystery on what is behind that door. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, many. If one just defines treasure in material wealth \u2014 gold, jewelry, etc. there are many fortunes that are hidden - either because the owners don\u2019t like to display wealth or the wealth is ill gotten, or lost. Given the ancient history and historical wealth of India, one would assume there is a lot of wealth that was hidden, and then lost as the people hiding it died without being able to pass on the information on how to find it. So the wealth was lost. However, India has much in form of non material treasures to offer, either hidden (such as rich history and culture) or lost (such as Ayurveda, Vedic math), etc. ",
