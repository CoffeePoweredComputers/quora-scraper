            "answer_text": "Is January 2016 a real possibility? Yes, it is already on. So is a cold war. Let's look at the key factors: Military stand-off. Yes, Russian current forces are not enough to invade Poland let alone Europe. However nuclear stand-off is there: Russia restored nuclear forces to the degree they can inflict unacceptable damage to US proper. US conducted two Trident launches clearly visible from a major population centre. Nukes are no longer something that you own but not talk about in a polite society - they are out there in front. Proxy wars. Well, ask Syrians . Russia is killing anti-Russian Syrians, NATO ally Turkey is killing anti-Turkish Syrians. Two sides of the confrontation are killing Syrians they don't like, including civilians, and whoever left is trying to get out of the country before it's their turn. Economic segregation. Well, we can remember with smiles the times when IBM PC XT was declared a strategic technology that shouldn't be exported to USSR, however the sanctions and embargoes are there, and so is Russia's effort to do \"import replacement\".Ideological confrontation. The ideological confrontation of today is about \"Multi-Polar World\" vs \"Democracy\". It is not suitable for invading foreign countries, but much better than Communism for building alliances - say USSR and China were enemies despite both Communists, yet Russia and China are collaborating as both want US look the other way now and then. Building \"an image of an enemy\". Russians increasingly believe that US are out to exterminate them. US Quorans sincerely believe that Russia is the worst country in the world as far as human rights are concerned, and is about to overrun the whole of Europe. There are some differences though: The anti-US alliance is not really anti-US - say China is still making most of their money manufacturing US designs for US consumers. And the alliance is very looseThe anti-US forces are much weaker than US this time, but are much better in letting US to shoot themselves in the foot. Like say in Syria - demand Assad removal, allow the Gulf allies to create a situation when the likely alternative - ISIS - is even worse, allowing Turkey to bomb Kurds who were the only pro-US force in Iraq, then supporting Kurds, then Turkey against Kurds again. Ideological clarity is gone. It used to be Communism against Capitalism. Today it is supposed to be about Democracy against Totalitarism, yet it is increasingly broken in favour of realpolitik - say Armenia is a functioning Democracy while Azerbaijan is a hereditary presidency, yet with oil and strategic access to Caspian Sea, so gets to befriend US. And of course Saudis. And it is increasingly harder to explain how exactly Turkey's Erdogan is different from Russia's PutinThere used to be the Iron Curtain. Now we have Internet which is an exact opposite.So it is a different Cold War, but it is a Cold War. Thank you for A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "We're already in one. The Second Cold War began in 2014 when Russia's Putin regime invaded eastern Ukraine, captured Crimea, and started fighting against the legitimate government. This has all the hallmarks of a hot conflict in a cold war. Direct involvement by the Russians and aid for the other side coming in from the US. The other major conflict of today, the Syrian Civil War, is possibly the same thing to an even greater degree. The United States and the alliance of democracies have been very publicly opposed to the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad, but Putin's government has been very publicly supportive of it. The US and our allies have been bombing ISIL and sending huge amounts of aid to the democratic freedom fighters in Syria. Although the Russians have also been bombing ISIL, their primary focus is propping up the al-Assad government. I don't doubt that Syria may be the Korean War of today. It's a regional conflict with major international implications. The Skripal affair of late is another indicator that NATO and Russia are already in a cold war. When Russia is assassinating UK spies on UK soil, that indicates that, not only are there Russian operatives in NATO countries, but that they are operational and ready to kill. The diplomatic fallout from the Skripal affair could very well be the straw that breaks the camel's back, turning this officially into a cold war. Additionally, Russia has been ramping up tests of nuclear missiles recently, and in one video even showed warheads landing on the United States. If that doesn't sound like something Khrushchev's USSR would do, then I don't know what does. The introduction of China as a superpower may make this a three-sided cold war. All three sides have differing interests in the conflict. I shudder to think of the pure destruction that World War 3 will cause. Let's as a society try to avoid it. ",
