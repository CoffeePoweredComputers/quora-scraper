            "answer_text": "Manusmruthi denigrated women in various aspects of their activities. It doesn't extend freedom and independence to women. Several restrictions are imposed on women and are forced to live in servitude of men folk. The restrictions are imposed on every aspect of daily routine right from their her movement within the precincts of their homes,like eating, dressing, talking etc . Marriageability is the exclussive selection of the groom & parents choice. We have to go a long way in modifying these restrictions especially in rural scenario. Education is the only strengthening way to liberate women from the strangles of opposite gender. ",
