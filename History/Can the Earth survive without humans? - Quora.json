And because there isn\u2019t a single specie on Earth that can take it to the destruction only Man one sees that nature can\u2019t survive if Man continues taking a kind of way of living like he is taking now and if Man doesn\u2019t do nothing on the contrary Earth and all others living beings and Man will desapear from the face of Earth.

Earth is the same manner. if man-kind disappear, there won\u2019t be any environmental management nor development. Earth will suffer fatal damage without having a balance in cycle of life. Here is why humanity needed for all of us to survive: Recycle development.Natural disaster contamination protection.Extincted breeds and races protection.Vaccine, medical instruments and treaties.Specie dialog for diplomacy and wars.Adaption of physics, law and categorization of knowledge breach.Emotional harmonization and influence over integrations.Innovation of systems, intellect and breeds.Invocation of bonds and logic.Control of life force and balance.Inheritance of wills and technology projection.The cycle of life entitles that human beings are part of continuation of life chain and wheel of fate. Simply everything collapse if one life form vanishes. So what about if the ace specie that controls everything and represent the backbone of this world, will also vanish? ",

            "answer_text": "We cannot live without humanity for many reasons, but here are two of the most important reasons. Humans are, by necessity, pack animals. Individually, we can\u2019t know everything we have to know in order to survive on our own. Yes, there have been exceptions, especially in the beginning, perhaps. Now, it would be too exhausting for one person to start fires, hunt for meat, forage for food, cook, make clothing and shelter, collect water, protect ourselves against predators, and prepare for nature.We are fragile creatures. For cuts and scrapes, and with the right knowledge and equipment, we can avoid diseases and infections from cuts and abrasions. For something more serious, like lacerations, broken bones, amputations, etc., we need partners. As a species, we cannot survive without helpers in case of emergencies. For each injury, we are taking time away from the other essential activities listed in #1. As a species, we would be doomed.Aside from the above, our mental health has been proven to be stronger when we spend time with like individuals. This does not necessarily mean family. They can often stress us more than strangers. Each kind act you accomplish each day adds to your mental health bank. You can be kind to animals and trees, but they don\u2019t give you the same immediate gratitude (hugs, verbal thanks, rewards) as people. Enjoy humanity, feed positive energy into it and it will feed positive energy back. ",
