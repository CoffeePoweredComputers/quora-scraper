            "answer_text": "There are 2 possibilities. If your immune system reacts vigorously, the bacteria (mycobacterium leprae) will stick to your nerves, and most probably you will not experience any deadly symptoms. However, if your immune system responds weakly, the bacteria will run rampant through your body. You will lose your sensation of pressure and pain. Also the area between your nostrils might collapse. Why is the first symptom deadly? Sometimes pain might be the only sign that something is wrong. If you don\u2019t feel pain, you won\u2019t know that something is wrong, you won\u2019t seek medical help, and whatever is wrong is more likely to kill you. But leprosy does not rot flesh. It does not cause your hands & legs to fall of. If you die of leprosy, you either die due to loss of sensation, or you die due to nostril collapse. ",
