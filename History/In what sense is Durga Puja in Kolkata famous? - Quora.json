            "answer_text": "There may be many other specialties that people may point out. But to my mind, Durga pooja is not just a \u201cPooja\u201d in real sense. But more, with it\u2019s family aspect as embedded in course of time. Goddes Durga is considered like Mother. She comes every year to this land right from from Heaven, together with her four children. When it\u2019s time that our beloved mother is coming, the people here get ready with whole heart to give her a grand welcome. People show all their love, respect and emotion to her. they treat her exactly the same way as one does with her biological mother as a child. The day she departs back, is always a moment of sorrow for the people of this land, just like we feel for our real mother. I find this occasion more a family affairs. It\u2019s not just a mandate or compulsion to perform Rituals to appease God / Goddess for some purposes. I see less spirituality in this function but more emotional around the feel for our mother for whom we wait for a year. I think that\u2019s why, Durga Pooja has such mass appeal for years such that no political intervention can take it away. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cYou want your city green and clean stick to DelhiYou want your city rich and impersonal, go to BombayYou want them hi-tech and full of Draught beer, Bangalore is your placeBut, if you want a city with a soul, come to Calcutta\u201d ~ Vir Sanghni , Indian Journalist  Durga Puja is synonymously cogitated as the ascendancy of good over evil but there\u2019s immeasurably more to it. Durga Puja represents what Kolkata has always been-\u201drich cultural city with love for intellectualism\u201d. Kolkata at this time of the year is more than just the city of joy, it is the city of art , city of curious people and a city for lost souls which you may rummage here and there in the streets of College Street leafing through the pages of classics written by R.N Tagore. Pandal hopping at that time when every corner of the city is elegantly draped with streetlights adds a different vibe altogether.These lights are not just any form of electrical grow through a plastic mould. These lights are the glow of hope. This crowd seems eccentric. Lively-cheerful and high on life. That kind of \u201chigh on life\u201d which dosen\u2019t necessitate being consumed by weeds. But, do you know what the heart of this festival is? No, it\u2019s not just Pandal hopping through and out the lanes of north and south Kolkata but it\u2019s the relentless effort of the thousands of artists who come together working day and night to make this festival possible- making all the theme based Pujas imperishable. The traditional charm or elegance of North stands in contrast to the artistic creativity and opulence of the south. The backdrop of the art being Shola work, Chalchitra and Patachitra . And the name of Kumortuli- the place where idols of Maa Durga are whittled from clay ,is just enough to leave us in a wondrous -soul stirring state. But, do you know what is a greater art form? It is the placid and winsome smile on the faces of those poor people for being able to feed their family. Because, it is that time of the year when they are employed. You can feel the flavour of uniqueness and breathe freedom in every pandal you visit. Each Pandal epitomizes the assorted vision of every artist . Traversing from one pandal to another embodies leaving behind the views or thoughts of one artist to immerse yourself into the mind of another artist. And that pretty much is representative of how life unfolds in general. You find people- not just Bengalees but people from all castes, religion come together and embrace life to it\u2019s fullest. Durga Puja represents what India is in general. Did, I mention how at this time of the year this city nonchalantly transitions to being a city of food lovers as well? Starting with Chinese to Mughal to pure Bengali food, the street food has every piquant food out there to set your heart wanting for more. Durga Puja represents the tale of curious characters and explorers in search for adventure represented by the curiosity of people to explore more and more theme based pandals. Forget Paris. At this time of the year and in general , I call Kolkata the city of love. The main element of love revolves around innocence , purity and understanding at a deeper level. The mere unvarnished act of sitting by the Princep Ghat , reciting a poem or two occasionally and engaging into a deep conversation ranging from life to politics to anything under the sun is a heavenly feeling. That vulnerability that accompanies alongside the conversation, makes everything seem just so pure. The concept of love as seen elsewhere has always been fast paced. Kolkata on the contrary has stick to it\u2019s \u201cslow down, pause and breathe \u201c nature of love. Unlike other cities the city seems a bit laid back. The people here knows how to savour each and every moment of life. To listen to your inner voice you need to slow down. And that\u2019s how the city presents its soul. There are cities where you can be surrounded by thousands of people and still be lonely and there are cities where you may be surrounded by just a few and still feel lively from inside. Kolkata is just that city. But, amidst all these beautiful chaos and liveliness life seems still for that lost soul out there locked in her room. That person occasionally writes poems and sometimes looks out of the window. Life is all the same for this soul during and after the puja. Solitude takes over amidst the jeering loudspeakers. This person finds solace in her own little world and the city dosen\u2019t even come in her way to embrace life in a way not many can embrace. ",
