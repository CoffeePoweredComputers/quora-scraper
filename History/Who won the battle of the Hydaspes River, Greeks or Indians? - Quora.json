            "answer_text": "Contrary to popular belief, many historians believe that King Porus had won the Battle of Hydaspes. Here are some of the reasons to support the argument. Both were alive after the battle and King Porus retains his kingdom without paying any allegiance to Alexander.In case of inconclusive battles, one way to find out who had upper hand to find who was denied the motive of the war. As per this logic King Poru won was he stopped the conquest of Alexander further into India. Other point that favours the alternate version is that since Alexander was revered for not loosing a battle in his life, historians has more incentive to interpret his last major Battle of Battle of Hydaspes positively in favour of the Macedonians.Lack of alternate version from supposedly loosing side also points to either as their victory or they found it inconsequential. Although this battle found prominent place in Greek, British and western historians in general, there is very little records in Indian history. Only record one could find reference to Alexander as an invader is when Chankaya was trying to unite all 16 Mahajanpadas while tutoring future torchbear of Maurya Empire - King Chandragurta Maurya himself.Tiny kingdom: There is very little information about King Porus or his kingdom itself. His kingdom Paurav Rashtra which was in between river of Jhelum and Chenab was too small to find itself in map of Anguttara Nikaya (atleast the major one) - Buddhist scripture that mapped India at that time. So it is most likely that Battle of Hydaspes was exaggerated in western history to bid adieu his glorius run.Nervous First steps to India: This battle was treated as first step to India. Before this all Alexander could is to re-capture what already was under Achaemenid empire like mountain area of Kamboja and Gandhara. Achaemenid empire covered area western to Indus river. So the first thing he did to invite former Achaemenid satraps to bloster his army of 20,000 foot soldiers and 2000 horse. All but King Ambhi responded positively who was hostile to his eastern neighbor, King Poru.King Porus and his Rakhi-sister Roxana: According to one legendary narrative, when Alexander the Great invaded India in 326 BCE, Roxana (or Roshanak, his wife) sent a sacred thread to Porus, asking him not to harm her husband in battle. In accordance with tradition, Porus, the king of Kaikeya kingdom, gave full respect to the rakhi. In the Battle of the Hydaspes, when Porus saw the rakhi on his own wrist and restrained himself from attacking Alexander personally..Resistance, fear and revolt: Even with support of King Ambhi and his 5000 additional soldiers, fanatical resistance put up by the Poru\u2019s soldiers and ordinary people there had shaken the nerves of Alexander's army to the core. Alexander lost most of his cavalry. His favorite horse Buccaphalus died, He himself was critically wounded in battle. His army had never faced use of war elephants before. It was striking for them to find out that such a small kingdom could depute 30000 fighting men. They just refused to move any further east and revolted. More they knew about kingdoms in the east and their might, they realized they has just faced tiny army and what lies was a multitude of force.Return and retreat: After Alexander gave up to demand of their soldiers they decide to return along with river Indus as they had been less hostile to western forces. Even while returning, Alexander's army was constantly harried by Indian partisans, republics and kingdoms.Ref: The Life and Exploits of Alexander by Mr E.A.W.
