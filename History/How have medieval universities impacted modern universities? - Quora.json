            "answer_text": "MEDIEVAL UNIVERSITIES have impacted modern universities in lots of ways. First of all most of them grew out of eras of great scientific progress.During the Islamic Golden Age one of the first formal universities started.This in turn led to the European Renaissance, a period in which universities in Europe became more formalized. The idea of the professor grew out of the Islamic world. One major difference was that Islamic universities and European ones were almost entirely based on religion.During the late medieval understanding eastern religions and languages were also added.This lead to many other subjects being added like comparative theology and linguistics .Also they were very accepting of people of all ages(Although modern universities don't accept underage students unless they are child prodigies).Also like any other university you had to have certain skills to get accepted.In the University of Fez you had to memorize the entire Quran to be applicable to attend lectures.They also at least housed a library full of manuscripts. Although not entirely related medical schools for physicians in Damascus required that they learned how to dissect bodies(although not human).So like modern universities they performed hands on hands experiments.Also many subjects like Quranic interpretation and Biblical narration came from this era.Also the degrees (most of which were equivalent to P.h.D and Master) evolved from the university of Timbuktu.This university had many fields in Business ,Agriculture ,Science and most importantly Islamic scholarship.Universities like these in Islamic Spain helped preserve ancient Greek texts from which the basis of Western scholarship evolved.
