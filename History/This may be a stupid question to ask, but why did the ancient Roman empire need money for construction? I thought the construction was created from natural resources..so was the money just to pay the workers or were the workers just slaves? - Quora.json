            "answer_text": "They needed money for contractors, labor, and materials. The Roman State, unlike modern states, generally did not undertake building projects with state-employed laborers. While state-owned slaves existed, these were generally support for various state organs (e.g., minor assistants or clerks for certain state or religious figures) rather than a large construction corps on their own. In this circumstance, it helps to remember that the Roman state was, in reality, tiny. It was not what we would recognize as a national government, but rather the municipal government of a large city governing as indirectly as possible because it didn't have the manpower to do otherwise. In short, imagine if the United States weren't governed by the Federal Government in DC, but if, instead, New York City's municipal government was trying to run the show. Given that, Rome's governing M.O. was: delegate, delegate, delegate. At home in Rome, delegate to private contractors. Outside of Rome, delegate to local governments as long as they pay taxes. Pursuant to that M.O., the Romans employed what are known as publicani\u2014private contractors who bid on public contracts. These days, the term \u201cpublicani\u201d are heavily associated with tax farming today, especially in a Biblical context, but technically they referred to anyone or any group of people engaging in bids for public contracts (which, of course, did include bidding for tax farming contracts). These publicani were the ones who generally provided labor and materials and oversaw the actual construction of the project. To do so, they often entered into a kind of limited partnership called a societas. In a societas, a group of individuals came together to pool resources, engage in projects, and then divide the earnings of those projects according to a preset proportion. They were somewhat like a modern legal corporation except they weren\u2019t limited liability and didn\u2019t have personhood\u2014unlike today, where if I make a deal with the VP of Sports Corporation Ltd. I\u2019m making a deal with Sports Corporation Ltd., under the Roman societas I would be making the deal solely and exclusively with that VP, and would have no rights to pursue the societas as a whole if something went wrong. They were also quite fragile constructs: a societas was immediately dissolved if one (only one) of the parties decided to leave, for example, or if one member took legal action against another. Similarly, if a member died the societas was dissolved, or if a member was forced to give up some goods through a court order. Even outside of those situations, the partnerships were limited in scope, and were generally dissolved upon the completion of the business at hand. They were business partners coming together for a project, not co-founders founding their own business. These societas-type organizations were therefore fairly short-lived and fluid: there would be a central core of managers (the publicani), but labor and materials might in turn be subcontracted out to yet other groups, which might include the purchase of raw materials like stone, marble, and brick, or the \u201crenting\u201d of slave labor. Skilled labor\u2014such as architects and engineers, as well as those doing finer work\u2014would also be hired by the societas for the projects. All of this took money, and the societas paid for all of this out of the money pooled by its members, to be reimbursed by payment from the Roman State after the job was complete. So, long story short: the Roman state did surprisingly little on its own, and until quite late relied very heavily on private contractors to do a lot of the work. Those contractors needed money to hire on labor pools, specialists, and to pay for materials. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cCreated from natural resources\u201d doesn\u2019t mean free or instantly, universally available. After all, every artificial thing around you is ultimately created from some natural resource. But stones have to be quarried and transported, trees have to be cut down and shaped, metals have to be mined, refined, and shaped, fibers must be harvested and woven, materials have to be shipped to where they\u2019re used and suitably put in place, all of that work has to be planned and supervised, and so on. All of that work has to be performed by people, who at the very least have to be fed, clothed, and housed, which implies subsidiary layers of agriculture and construction. And, of course, the empire didn\u2019t own all the land nor all the people. Quarries for stone, farms for producing the food that fed everybody, mines for metal ores, even forests for wood were often privately owned, so the owners got paid even if substantial numbers of agricultural workers were slaves (though there were plenty of free farmers as well). Ship-owners got paid to move goods around, as did sailors (galley slaves aren\u2019t entirely mythical, but they were relatively uncommon) and many of the people who loaded and unloaded the ships. And actual construction labor was provided by a mix of free and slave labor. There\u2019s an odd twist here in that some labor was provided by free workers, but they weren\u2019t paid for it. There are cases in Roman tax law where levies of labor were required as a tax obligation rather than money or taxes in kind (that is, goods paid as taxes). So while slave labor was a component in all of this, there were enough free people involved that all of this work required paying a lot of people for a lot of things. ",

            "answer_text": "Natural resources in the Roman Empire were not necessarily state property. Gold and silver were but other materials would belong to private land owners. There were also vastly more private buildings than public, therefore all manner of businesses traded in construction materials to meet the demands of builders. This could cover everything from stone to lumber. So just like today, simply buying stone from a privately owned and professionally run quarry is a lot simpler for a government building project than establishing a brand new quarry on government land. In addition brick and roof tiles were very common building materials which needed to be manufactured. During the Severan dynasty the emperor came to monopolize the brick trade, although this didn\u2019t necessarily mean the material became free for state use. ",

It is a means to say who owns how much resource in the society. When the Roman Imperial gov wants to construct something, it indeed needs resources and the amount is measured by money. When you say it costs X to construct Y, it means you need X amount of resources to construct Y. ",
