            "answer_text": "First, they are all Iraqis. However, This map belongs to 1425 years ago ((before America/USA being discovered which now contains around 300 million originally-European+African people, but they are Americans). Currently, Iraq is more homogeneous (with a predominant Arab culture) than the map says. Knowing that the green region in the above map is almost desert. Even at that time, The most populated region was the black-colored in the above map which contains Arabs. Howeve, Iraqis believe they are Iraqis with an Iraqi culture which is distinct from that of other countries in the Middle East. On the other hand, if you need more details about the Arabic culture in Iraq , I can say about %75 of Iraqis feel they have an Arabic culture (this percentage includes many Kurds, Turkmen, and and Assyrian Iraqis that live in central Iraq). They speak Arabic fluently (with Iraqi dialect) they behave like Arab , listen to Arabic music and songs, and they eat Arab food. The other %25 respect Arab culture and don't have serious issues with them apart from their political and financial problems with the central government of Iraq (They only region with a non-Arabic culture is in far northern Iraq). I have three Iraqi-Kurds friends in my university. Nowadays, there are about 8 millions live in Baghdad which in central Iraq and have an obvious Arab culture (with Iraqi features, of course).
