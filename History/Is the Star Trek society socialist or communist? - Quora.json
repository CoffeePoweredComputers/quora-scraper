            "answer_text": "No, Star Trek is not a socialist-communist socio-economic system. I\u2019ve studied this many years, and most people who think it is an example of a command economy don\u2019t take into account these three factors about Star Trek. Private property and business ownership existsTransporter and replicator technology changed the economyThe existence and possible nature of the Federation CreditIn Star Trek: Deep Space 9, Commander Sisko\u2019s father, Joseph, owns a restaurant in New Orleans. In fact, in the Deep Space 9 episode \u201cHomefront\u201d, Benjamin Sisko\u2019s son complains he doesn\u2019t want work in the kitchen all day peeling potatoes. So much for everyone pulling together for the betterment of all, but who would want to work in a kitchen all day peeling potatoes? Whoever had that task most likely would have received some sort of compensation for that menial labor. No one likes peeling potatoes so much they\u2019ll do it for the mere betterment of humanity. Captain Picard, on Star Trek: The Next Generation, has a brother who owns a vineyard. The holographic doctor on Star Trek: Voyager has to make an intellectual property claim in Federation court, because a person took ownership of his holonovel on the principle that The Doctor wasn\u2019t technically a living being with the full set of individual rights afforded a sentient, living being. Business ownership and property are foreign concepts, or at least frowned upon in socialism/communism, but Star Trek has numerous examples of both. Next, the mastery of energy to matter to energy conversion upended the socio-economic paradigm, but advancements in technology often bring about fundamental changes in an economy; just look at the industrial revolution. Prior to the industrial revolution food was one of the most important commodities a nation could need or sell. The industrial revolution changed that by changing the way we grew our foods and produced our goods; this resulted in a shift from an agrarian society to an urban/industrial society. The main reason why this shift occurred was due to advances in technology. These advances allowed inventors to develop machines which increased efficiency of the farms. These efficiencies led to more food being produced by less people, and increased demand for these machines by the farmers, further increasing demand at the factories for people to produce the machinery, which in turn went further in driving people to the cities from the farms. Now, let\u2019s imagine if we lived in the Star Trek world of transporters and replicators. When you want to travel from New York to London you don\u2019t hail a taxi, go to an airport, then fly to London; you merely step into a transporter and then arrive at your destination as quickly as if you passed through a door. If you needed a device for playing music, you wouldn\u2019t go to a \u201cstore\u201d, but would go to a replicator where you would then replicate your music playback device. There are no labor costs, because there\u2019s no store clerk. There\u2019s no shipping cost, because the item is created on demand. That alone would drop the real cost so significantly, it can probably be given away without charge. That seques me into the next point, people fail to realize that even though the Federation doesn\u2019t use a physical currency, they still have a way to have a unit of account, a medium of exchange, and a store of value. This is called the Federation Credit. What that is exactly isn\u2019t explained at all, but the way the Ferengi regard the Federation Credit, it might be a fiat currency. Personally, after great thought, I don\u2019t think the the Federation Credit is a fiat currency. I believe the Federation Credit is an energy based currency. I came to this conclusion when I thought deeply about all the societal changes energy to matter, matter to energy conversion would create. When you break it down, replicators can convert matter into energy and energy into matter. It creates objects from a stored pattern, and it can recycle almost any material including human waste, animal waste, lawn clippings, trash in the street, or even a dead body. The recycled mass is stored in the terrestrial electrical grid, which if it\u2019s anything like a Federation starship, it\u2019s not electricity per s\u00e9, but plasma. Each item recycled would, depending on atomic structure and mass, provide a certain level of energy, so I deduced that 1 Federation Credit would represent the number of joules of energy that came from a recycled standard. In other words, the energy from something like an ounce of titanium, gold, silver, or other element. This would allow a person to receive credit for recycling matter in a replicator, and then receive Federation credits in an amount commensurate with number of joules of energy (energy value) created from recycling. That in turn would lead to homes with sewage systems that used replication technology to recycle everything. The occupants would receive Federation Credits commensurate with the energy value of things they\u2019ve recycled, and then, in turn, those people could replicate anything they wished so long as it didn\u2019t exceed their account balance. In essence, a person would start creating an account balance the minute they\u2019re born. Then throughout life, every time a person defecated, urinated, bathed, cleaned house, mowed lawns, picked up around the neighborhood, or disposed of matter into the system, their account is credited. If they make a ham sandwich and a beer, their account is debited. This would allow for a situation where small items like food are seemingly free, while at the same time making the replication of a starship too expensive. This is so, because a person can poop the energy value of a ham sandwich everyday, and never have to materially contribute to society in order to survive. If you want a vehicle, you need to somehow acquire the mass to gain the energy value necessary to replicate that vehicle. In conclusion, Star Trek has numerous examples of individuals, taking initiative, running businesses and engaged in private commerce without state interference, but they do so with the benefit of technology we only dream of.

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s be clear here. The TOS Federation is a very different animal from TNG. But for TNG\u2026yeah it\u2019s a socialist society. People say it\u2019s a \u201cpost-scarcity\u201d society and that\u2019s because the characters pretend that\u2019s what it is, but it really isn\u2019t. Let me ask you something: Does everyone in TNG really have anything they want? Does everyone have their own interstellar FTL vessel for example? Of course not! Almost nobody has a ship. And it\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want a ship. Vash, for example would have loved to have her own ship. But she couldn\u2019t even afford a trip offworld. Space travel is a commodity in limited supply. Transporter usage is a commodity in limited supply. Wesley Crusher has a limited allowance of times he\u2019s allowed to use a transporter to travel per year. Doctor Bashir\u2019s father is working at a job he doesn\u2019t like (Shuttlecraft steward of all the ridiculous things) while hoping he can one day get a more preferable job (landscaper). Jobs people want are commodities in limited supply. Sisko\u2019s father runs a restaurant. Is there room for everyone who wants to run a restaurant in that city? Is there room in every single restaurant for everyone who might want to go there on a given night? Seating space and prime locations are commodities in limited supply. The Federation still engages in trade and does research on developing new energy sources. That says that they do not have in fact have everything they could want in unlimited supply already. Money exists as a method for rationing commodities in limited supply. But, in the TNG era, we\u2019re told that money doesn\u2019t exist. Now that could just mean that money doesn\u2019t exist in hard currency, that it\u2019s all virtual and you draw on \u201cbank accounts\u201d to pay for your shuttle tickets or whatever. Probably not what Roddenberry had in mind though. So yeah, it\u2019s probably something in the democratic socialist line. (Note that in TOS however, the Federation did have hard currency.) ",
