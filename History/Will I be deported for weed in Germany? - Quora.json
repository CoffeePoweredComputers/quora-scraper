            "answer_text": "Depends if it gets to court. If the Staatsanwalt (district attorney) gets involved you might be in trouble (at which point you absolutely should get a lawyer); but with small amounts of cannabis he or she often closes the case instead of pursuing it all the way to court, in which case you are probably fine. Check the Bet\u00e4ubungsmittelgesetz, BtMG - nichtamtliches Inhaltsverzeichnis, especially Article 31a is interesting for your case. As far as I know you only get deported if sentenced to longer than half a year (or one year? That recently changed). But possession of illegal drugs is a Straftat (felony), not a less-serious Ordnungswidrigkeit (misdemeanour), if it gets to court. Weed possession for self-consumption would not, I am fairly certain, get you deported. I suspect it is likely that a felony in your books will influence you residence permit extension. Even though I have significant sympathies for legalising cannabis; you are a guest in Germany\u2026. Edit: after seeing that you use not a name but a weird alias, and in particular after reading you threatening people replying to your post I want to join Johan Kevers\u2019 assessment of the situation: Don\u2019t be a cunt!
