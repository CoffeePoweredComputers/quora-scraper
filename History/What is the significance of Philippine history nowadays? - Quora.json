            "answer_text": "The significance of Phil History is it teaches lessons, mainly in politics, that should not be repeated, if we want to move forwards. I have just finished reading the Memoirs of Isabelo de los Reyes, a newspaperman, writer, propagandist, and reformer - writing in 1896\u20131897 when the national revolution against Spain erupted, leading to the declaration of Phil independence on June 12 1898. Up to the eve of the takeover of the Americans, de los Reyes was batting for a continued union with Spain - but on condition that the political meddling of Spanish friars at the provincial and muicnipal level should stop, the Spanish Constitution should also cover the Phils, there is freedom of association, free speech and free press, the end to arbitrary exile of patriots and the execution of Filipinos (notably, Dr. Jose P. Rizal), etc. Spain never gave in to the Filipino propagandists, until Spain sold the Phils to the U.S. for $20M - lock, stock and barrel. At the same time, the bational revolution erupted in August 1896, after the Katipunan was discovered, through the confession of a young girl to Fr. Mariano Gil, a Spanish friar of Tondo, Manila. And a year later, Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo took over the revolution to declare a republic of the Phils in Kawit Cavite - with the support of the Americans, who later turned against Aguinaldo and the Phil American War came for 4 years, until 1902, when the Filipino army, outgunned by more modern rifles, were defeated, and Aguinaldo was captured in Isabela. We see from this historical landscape the efforts of the propagandists, like Isabelo de los Reyes, who batted for a continued union with Spain, to the fight for independence led by Andres Bonifacio, and successfully turned into a \u201crepublic\u201d by Emilio Aguinaldo. A constitutional convention which formally established the republic was convened in Malolos while Aguinaldo was in power, and before his capture by the Americans. The later part of the 19th century was a dramatic historical kaleidoscope for the Philippines. It was an exciting time. Filipino ilustrados worked for a continuing union with Spain, the Katipunan led by Andres Bonifacio for complete independence and the driving away of the exploitative friars, and Aguinaldo leading the formal process for a republic. Today, the Philippines is a republic, a unitary state; but amending the constitution to make for a federal form of government is underway in the Congress. The new constitution will be submitted for a plebiscite next year. ",

            "answer_text": "It is part of the rich tapestry of human existence, as valid and important in its own right as any other part. Or - to mix metaphors - it is one of the many stones from which we create the mosaic that we call \u201chuman history.\u201d The assumption that some stones are \u201cimportant,\u201d and thus, presumably, others are not is simply to misunderstand what a mosaic is. (FWIW, the Philippines today, with over 100 million inhabitants, is one of the twenty largest countries in the world. Does that make it \u201cimportant\u201d? More profoundly: of what importance are YOU (the questioner) in the modern world? The same answers apply, albeit on a much smaller scale. ",
