            "answer_text": "It\u2019s okay. Better than most games. You can read the body language of your opponent well enough to anticipate what he\u2019s doing. However, for me there are two major drawbacks. It is far, far too slow. Frankly I am pretty bad at combat in KCD, because I am reacting faster than my avatar can. I see the attack coming, and it drifts in at a leisurely pace, while my brain is already two or three steps ahead, but my avatar is moving at the same snail-like rate, and so nothing works as it ought to. Related to the above, I find anything beyond basic hew and thrust very difficult, and the commands just don\u2019t mesh with anything in my head. This is just meaningless gibberish.  I mean, the words make sense, and the actions even exist in fencing, but the commands? I don\u2019t see how left, down left, thrust is zorn ort. It\u2019s\u2026kinda there? But it should just be hew-thrust. There\u2019s an extra step that makes no sense. And I\u2019ve always sucked at combos anyway. So when I remember the actual combo, it gets inputted too fast and things just go tits up.  Except, it\u2019s the other way around. Why are there four buttons if there are eight directions? Basically, I run into the same problem I do with marksmanship vs video games. I\u2019m a much better shot in real life. I\u2019m much better with a sword in real life. While many people seem to enjoy the additional complexity of combat in KCD, it is\u2026not HEMA. If we look at the actual actions, as shown in the video,  they don\u2019t really look like what\u2019s in the actual manuals and treatises. They sorta-kinda invoke real actions without quite being right. Then there\u2019s the fact that most of the guys you fight wear armor, and most of these cuts and hews\u2026hit that armor. And wound through it. No. Armor is really good. You have to fight a man in armor differently than a man in less or no armor. Overall, it was a pretty fun game, but frankly the combat was frustrating enough that I haven\u2019t finished it yet.
