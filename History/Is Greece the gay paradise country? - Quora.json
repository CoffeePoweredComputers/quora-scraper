            "answer_text": "Not really. Greece is one of the few countries with an \u201cofficial\u201d religion (90% are Christian Orthodox) and the Orthodox church, (like the Catholic Church) views gays and lesbians very negatively. When I was a kid, gays were also treated as second-class citizens. For example, all males have to go to the army. One way to avoid the army is to declare you are homosexual. In the past, being an open homosexual would automatically disqualified you for all the jobs as a civil servant (say, a teacher in a public school.) Not sure if this has changed (I have been living in the US for some time now). Old habits and strong religious beliefs are hard to change. ",

Some places, like Mykonos, are very very gay, but culturally it isn\u2019t anything like as open as you might expect if you\u2019ve been reading Greek ancient history. I met a sexual health worker in Greece, who told me that she\u2019d been told there were no gay Greeks. Hmmm. ",
