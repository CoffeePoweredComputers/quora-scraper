            "answer_text": "Historians need to be careful of using archaeological evidence because the archaeology is often incomplete or is subject to differenr interpretation. A lack of archaeological evidence does not necessarily prove a historical writren source wrong, since it may be the archaelogical evidence is there but just hasn't been found yet, or it was jusr lost do.the passage.of time. The lack of archaeogical evidence doesn't necessarily dispeove something. And the archaeological evidence might not be as clear cut as is thought. Carbon dating can give a margin of error in the date. Carbon 14 dating and other analysis of a map might indicate that the map is genuinely made of old paper, yet it could still be a modern forgery, where a clever forger used genuinely old parchmenr or paper to make his modern forgery. UPDATE: Since the poster who claimed that Pliny's letters to Trajan never existed.deleted my comments ro him, and disabled future replies to, I included the points I made to him below. When evaluating the validity and accuracy of any evidence, you need to evaluate all the facts, and not let your personal bias dictate your judgement. For example, one of the others posting an answer asserts there was no letters of Pliny to Trajan about Christians, and criticized historians for accepting them as genuine, but his claims and criticisms are baseless. He claims that a bshop found these letters but then they disappeared without any else having seen them, but that claim is not true. A Fra Gioconde found a 10th book of Pliny's letters to the Emperor Trajan in the 15th century, and a Peteus Leander appears to have made a copy of this manuscript, and the printer Aldus used this manscript in his printing of all 10 Pliny's books of letters in 1508, so we know at least a couple of people other than the \u201cbishop\u201d had seen the found manuscript. (This is not unusual to have rely on a single medieval copy of some ancient text that was only rediscovered in early modern times only to be lost centuries later by our times. Once good print copies were available, in the early days printings there was less incentive ro keep the original manuscript which may have been hard to read and old and fragile, and many of the original handwritren manuscripts on for a number of works have been lost, leaving us only the printed copies made from them.) The existence of the manuscript is not doubted by scholars except, and there is not the slightest justification in thinking that these letters were fabricated by Fra Gioconde; th ere are a 100 letters, and they all match the language and writing style of Pliny's other letters, and any insinuation Gioconde forged them, as the one poster does, is too absurd to consider. The poster allowed his personal bias and beliefs to criticized the historians, who universally accept the genuineness of Pliny's letters to Trajan based on a variety of evidence. (Unless they are Mythicist, like the one poster. Mythicist believe there was no Jesus, and he was solely a creation of later centuries, so any ancient text that undermines that view is always labeled a forgery or a fabrication, regardless of whether there is any supporting evidence or not. As in the case of Pliny's letters to Trajan whose genuinessness are not quesrions by anyone but the Mythicists like the poster). Historians need to be aware that archaeological evidence can be subject to the same potential subjective interpretation as written and other sources. Since hisrorians know that writers have biases, it might be tempting to assume that archaeological evidence is more objective, but that is not always the case. Archaeological evidence can be subjectively interpretated, same as other evidence, and people can reach different conclusions with the same archaeological evidence. ",

            "answer_text": "Historians should always use great care on their sources, following the Rules of Evidence as described in Historiography. Archaeology does not plead a special case against other sources. We see lots of claims for false archaeology; an example: somebody buys online an ancient artefact and contacts the media that they found it somewhere, then the claim is published that some ancient people visited America from the Old World. Many fall for it; historians should not. Being more specific, centuries ago, a bishop claims to have: Pliny the Younger on Christians \u201cPliny the Younger, the Roman governor of Bithynia and Pontus (now in modern Turkey) wrote a letter to Emperor Trajan around AD 112 and asked for counsel on dealing with the early Christian community.\u201d This Pliny and Trajan are historical and as we see, historians usually treat the claim as proven; such is not actually the case: There is no such letter - the bishop \u2018lost\u2019 it immediately after offering a translation. So yes, historians should check their sources very thoroughly and when they offer their histories, say what they are and what credibility they have. I need to see the source, as all science always begins with observation and in the subject I now specialise, have found many untruths. ",
