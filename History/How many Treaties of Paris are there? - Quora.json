            "answer_text": "Are you ready for a ride? If you do not like long answers, this one is definitely not for you. It is the longest I wrote on Quora so far. In total, I have managed to find 67 Treaties of Paris as well as two Peace Accords, eleven Conventions, five Protocols, one Charter, one Declaration and two Agreements - in total, 89 international agreements concluded in Paris (it seems that over the last decades the word \u201ctreaty\u201d is out of fashion). My list is much fuller than anything you would find in an English or a French Wikipedia. I still might have missed a treaty or a convention. Any suggestions are therefore welcome. Treaty of Paris (1214) was signed on 24 October 1214 by Philip II August, the King of France, and Jeanne de Constantinople, Duchess of Flanders. It was the aftermath of the great battle of Bouvines, in which the French King managed to crush a united army of English, Germans and Flemish. Jeanne\u2019s husband Ferrand was taken prisoner. The young woman (she was somewhere between 15 and 20 at the time) came to Paris to find King and signed a treaty. She agreed to demolish all fortresses in Flanders, give back all the property confiscated from the King\u2019s supporters and appoint King-approved baillis (governors). In exchange, she would get her husband back. Flemish Estates (parliament) never ratified the Treaty. Jeanne\u2019s husband spent 13 years in captivity.Treaty of Paris (1229) was signed on 12 April between Blanche of Castile, mother of the King Louis IX, and Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse. It marked the end of 20 years of crusades against the heretics in Southern France. Seeing his domains systematically looted, his people slaughtered, their houses burned, Raymond agreed to all the conditions. He agreed to join the fighting against the heretics, to destroy the walls of his capital, Toulouse, to marry his daughter to the King\u2019s brother and to agree that after his death, all his land would be annexed to the Crown of France.Treaty of Paris (1259) was signed on 4 December between Louis IX of France (Saint Louis) and Henry III of England. After fifty years of military failures, the English Kings were still reluctant to recognise that they have lost almost all their domains in France. However, Henry, plagued by rebels at home, who received French assistance, agreed to back down. He renounced to everything save Gascony, part of Aquitaine, Ponthieu and Channel Islands and agreed to recognise the French King as his suzerain in his French domains.Treaty of Paris (1295) was signed on 23 October between Philip IV the Fair of France and the representatives of John Balliol, King of Scotland. It was a defensive alliance against England. The treaty started the Auld Alliance of Scotland and France that would continue until 1560. However, even after that date French residing in Scotland and Scots residing in France could automatically get dual citizenship (and many exiled Jacobites used the possibility in the 18th century). This disposition would only be revoked in 1906.We can see that in all four treaties signed in Paris in 13th century, France was the dominant party. So it was just natural that people came to Paris to bow to the French King.  Raymond VII\u2019s ratification of the Treaty of Paris (left). A WW1 propaganda poster (right). 5. Treaty of Paris (1303). Signed between Philip IV the Fair of France and Edward I of England on 20 May, ended a nine-year war between two countries in a compromise way. The reason of this compromise was the great defeat inflicted on French knights by Flemish in the Battle of Golden Spurs in 1302. Gascony, seized by French, was returned to Edward, he recognised Philip as his suzerain, and two Kings decided to marry their kids. This measure of reconciliation would lead a very big war when the son of Edward\u2019s son and Philip\u2019s daughter will decide to claim the throne of France. 6. Treaty of Paris (1310) between Henry VII of the Holy Roman Empire and Philip IV the Fair of France mediated by Pope was supposed to make them friends. It did not work. 7. Treaty of Paris (1320) finally concluded the French-Flemish war. 8. Treaty of Paris (1323), signed on 6 March, ended the war between the Count of Flanders and the Count of Holland. Louis of Flanders recognised the sovereignty of his rival over Zeeland. 9. Treaty of Paris (1327), signed on 31 March, ended one more war between England and France. Badly beaten by the French, the English lost several provinces and had to pay a large war indemnity. 14-year-old Edward III, son of the French princess, did not appreciate this humiliation. Ten years later, he would start the Hundred Years\u2019 War. 10. Treaty of Paris (1355), signed on 5 January, ended the conflict between France and the County of Savoy. It involved a complicated exchange of lands between two countries. Besides, John the Good, King of France, renounced any claims to Geneva. He wanted his hands free for a big fight against the English invaders. The treaty allowed him to assemble a large force, that would be decisively defeated by the English next year. In 14th century, as we can see, it became a tradition that all treaties involving France should be signed in Paris. However, the 1323 treaty was an innovation because France was not a party to the treaty - and Paris still was chosen to sign it. However, because of the Hundred Years\u2019 War, the tradition would be abandoned for almost a century and a half.  When you are Edward I of England, conqueror of Scotland, Wales and Ireland, it is awfully humiliating to kneel to Philip of France for your French domains. But you have to do it. Edward III did not want to do it anymore. 11. Treaty of Paris (1498). As Louis XII was preparing to invade Italy, Philip the Fair, Count of Flanders and son of the Emperor Maximilian, concluded a treaty with him (on 2 August), which meant he would not interfere with King Louis\u2019s plans. 12. Treaty of Paris (1515). On 24 March, Charles, the 15-year-old Count of Flanders, concluded alliance with Francis I, King of France. They agreed that he would later marry Francis\u2019s daughter, the 4-year-old princess Ren\u00e9e. The marriage would never be concluded. Within four years, the young Count would become both the King of Spain and the Emperor of the Holy Empire, the strongest power in Europe. Charles and Francis would forever be enemies. 13. Treaty of Paris (1600). Signed on 27 February 1600 between Charles-Emmanuel I of Savoy and Henry IV of France. The Duke of Savoy wanted to keep Saluzzo, a French possession he seized. Henry pressed him to sign the treaty. Back to Savoy, the Duke started a new war. 14. Treaty of Paris (1623). France, Venice and Savoy signed an alliance against Spain. However, France did not fight Spain. Spain was struggling against a great Protestant alliance and Cardinal Richelieu feared to alienate French Catholics if he started fighting against His Catholic Majesty. 15. Treaty of Paris (1626) was signed on 5 February between King Louis XIII and the Huguenots (Protestants) of the city of La Rochelle. They could preserve religious freedom but had to destroy two key forts and could not keep a war fleet. After this treaty, a new war erupted, leading to the capture of La Rochelle in 1628 and liquidation of the last Protestant enclave in France. 16. Treaty of Paris (1634) was signed on 1 November between France, Sweden and Heilbronn League of Protestant princes in Germany. France promised them money and military assistance to fight Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. The treaty was never ratified because Swedish chancellor wanted better terms. A Franco-Swedish alliance would finally be signed at Compi\u00e8gne a year later. 17. Treaty of Paris (1635), signed on 25 February, established a Franco-Dutch alliance against Spain, both offensive and defensive. France entered the Thirty Years\u2019 War. 18. Treaty of Paris (1657) concluded by the Cardinal Mazarini and Oliver Cromwell meant an Anglo-French alliance against Spain. As a result, England conquered Dunkirk, later ceded to France. 19. Treaty of Paris (1662) established a defensive Franco-Dutch alliance. During the Anglo-Dutch war of 1664\u20131667, France would also fight England.  Siege of La Rochelle (left).

Treaty of Paris (1718), signed on 21 January between Philip of Orleans, Regent of France, and his brother-in-law Leopold, Duke of Lorraine and Bar, was just a landswap allowing for more contiguous borders of France and Lorraine (later in the century, Lorraine will become part of France). 21. Treaty of Paris (1749), signed on 15 August, specified borders between France and Geneva. 22. Treaty of Paris (1761) aka Third Family Compact, signed on 15 August, was an alliance between France and Spain, both ruled by Bourbon Kings. Spain honoured this treaty in 1761 and in 1779, entering wars with England to help France. It became obsolete during the French Revolution. 23. Treaty of Paris (1763), signed on 10 February, ended the Seven Years\u2019 War aka French and Indian War. France lost Canada, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tobago and Senegal to Britain. It also lost Western Louisiana to Spain and Eastern Louisiana (lands between Mississippi and Thirteen Colonies) to Britain. Spain lost Florida to Britain. 24\u201326. Treaty of Paris (1783), which ended the American Revolutionary War. In fact, there were three separate treaties, signed on 3 September 1783 in Paris. The Thirteen Colonies became independent and received all the former territories of East Louisiana. France gained Saint Lucia, Tobago and Senegal. Spain gained Menorca and Florida. 27. Treaty of Paris (1783), signed on 8 October, was the American-Dutch treaty of amity and commerce. 28. Treaty of Paris (1784), signed on 20 March, ended the fourth Anglo-Dutch War. The Dutch surrendered the Indian city of Negapatnam to Britain and allowed British to sail in their seas (it would lead to the establishment of British colonies in Singapore and Australia). 29. Treaty of Paris (1786), signed on 21 May, settled territorial disputes between France and Wurtemberg.  Family Compact. Allegory (left). The General Peace. English cartoon, 1783 (right). 30. Treaty of Paris (1796), signed on 15 May between France and Piedmont, resulted from the first campaign of the young Napoleon Bonaparte. France obtained Savoy and Nice - and the right of passage through the territory of Piedmont. 31\u201332. Treaties of Paris (1796) were signed on 7 and 22 May respectively with Wurttemberg and Baden, German states that chose to make separate peace with France seeing Napoleon\u2019s prowess. 33. Treaty of Paris (1796) was signed on 5 November with the Duchy of Parma that agreed to let French armies in its territory and pay a huge war indemnity. 34. Treaty of Paris (1801), signed on 24 August, was a Franco-Bavarian treaty of peace and alliance. Bavaria has lost some lands because of having fought against Napoleon; thanks to this treaty, it would get other lands. 35. Treaty of Paris (1801), mediated by France and signed on 4 October, ended the Russian-Spanish war. It was a weird war: no shot was fired during two years. Finally, Spanish and Russian ambassador agreed to restore the traditional amity of two countries. 36. Treaty of Paris (1802), signed on 20 May, regulated new borders of Wurttemberg. 37. Treaty of Paris (1802), signed on 25 June by Talleyrand and Mehmed Said Galip Pasha, ended the French-Ottoman war after the failure of Napoleon\u2019s Egyptian campaign. Interestingly, this treaty used three systems of dating: the French Revolutionary calendar, the Islamic calendar and the Gregorian calendar. 38. Treaty of Paris (1802), signed on 26 December between France and Austria, also dealt with territorial changes. Duke of Tuscany, brother of the Austrian Emperor, gave his territory to Napoleon and received a newly created Duchy of Salzburg in exchange. France then transferred Tuscany to the Duke of Parma, close relative of the Spanish King, because France wanted to keep Parma. In exchange for Tuscany, Spain surrendered not only Parma but Louisiana as well, that Napoleon would sell to Thomas Jefferson. 39. Treaty of Paris (1806), signed on 24 May by Talleyrand and the representatives of the Batavian Republic, sanctioned the transformation of the latter into the Kingdom of Holland under Napoleon\u2019s brother Louis Bonaparte. 40. Treaty of Paris (1806), signed on 12 July by Talleyrand and the representatives of sixteen German princes, established the Confederation of the Rhine that replaced the Holy Roman Empire. Curiously, one of these sixteen princely states still survives today. It is Liechtenstein. 41. Treaty of Paris (1810), signed on 6 January and mediated by Russians, ended Franco-Swedish war of 1808\u20131809. Sweden accepted to become part of the Continental Blockade against Britain. Swedes would elect renowned Napoleonic marshal Bernadotte to be their next King, in hopes he would guarantee French support for a new war against Russia. Bernadotte would ally with Russia and turn against Napoleon. 42. Treaty of Paris (1810), signed on 28 February between France and Bavaria, dealt with exchanges of territory. As a result, Bavaria would lose lots of land in one place and get lots of land in another place. 43\u201345. Treaties of Paris (1810) signed between Bavaria and Wurttemberg, Baden and Hessen and Wurttemberg and Baden, regulated their borders. 46. Treaty of Paris (1812), signed on 5 March, established Franco-Prussian alliance against Russia. Prussia was obliged to assist Napoleon in his invasion of Russia, giving him half of its army, provisions, munitions and horses and wagons to transport them. A quarter of Prussian officer corps (300 officers) resigned their commissions when hearing of this treaty: most of them would go to Russia to help defend it against Napoleon, including a young officer Carl von Clausewitz who would become a famous military writer. 47. First Treaty of Paris (1814), signed on 30 May, ended the war between Napoleonic France and the Sixth Coalition. Napoleon was removed from throne and replaced with Louis XVIII Bourbon. In general, due to Czar Alexander\u2019s patronage and to Talleyrand\u2019s skill, the conditions were very lenient. France kept some of its conquests and did not pay any indemnity. 48. Second Treaty of Paris (1815), signed on 20 November, definitely ended the war between France and the Sixth Coalition. It was necessary because of Napoleon\u2019s brief return to France (the Hundred Days). New terms were much harsher. France lost more land, had to pay 700 million francs in indemnities and was subjected to Allied occupation. It was also - why do I think of Donald Trump? - obliged to finance defensive fortification of its neighbours against itself. An additional article and an act signed on the same day had important consequences. The former was a declaration to stop the slave trade and the latter recognised neutrality of Switzerland. 49. Treaty of Paris (1816) restored the Bonaire island to the Dutch after nine years of British administration. 50. Treaty of Paris (1817), signed on 20 June by the representatives of European Big Five and Spain, gave the Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon\u2019s wife, three duchies in Italy - Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla to live peacefully with her lover. During Napoleon\u2019s time, Paris was the capital of Europe. After 1815, France lost its leading role in European politics. That is why the next Treaty of Paris will be signed only four decades later.  If you chop a piece too big, you may sometimes choke with it. 51. Treaty of Paris (1856), signed on 30 March, ended the Crimean War between Russia and the alliance of Britain, France, Ottoman Empire and Sardinia. Russia lost South Bessarabia and its status of protector of Ottoman Christians (it was given to France). Both Russia and the Ottoman Empire were prohibited from keeping fortresses or war fleet in the Black Sea. 52. Treaty of Paris (1857), signed on 4 March, ended the Anglo-Persian War. Iran had to abandon its plans to annex the city of Herat. 53. Treaty of Paris (1857) between Prussia and Switzerland was mediated by France and signed on 26 May. The King of Prussia renounced to all claims to the Swiss city of Neuch\u00e2tel that belonged to Kings of Prussia since 1708. 54\u201355. Treaties of Paris (1879) were signed on 14 and 21 August between Spain and respectively Peru and Bolivia, ending the war between these countries. 56. Treaty of Paris (1898), signed on 10 December, ended the Spanish-American War. Cuba became independent. The Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico were annexed by the USA. Spain received a $20 million compensation. 57. Treaty of Paris (1900), signed on 27 June between France and Spain, settled the borders of R\u00edo Muni, the future Equatorial Guinea, and R\u00edo de Oro (future Western Sahara). 58. Treaty of Paris (1918), signed on 17 July, defined relations between France and Monaco, barring the possibility of German princes becoming Mon\u00e9gasque souverains. 59. Treaty of Paris (1920), signed on 28 October between France, UK, Italy, Japan and Romania, recognised Romanian annexation of Bessarabia. USA refused to sign the treaty. Finally, the treaty never came into effect because Japan did not ratify it. 60. General Treaty for Renunciation of War as an Instrument of National Policy aka Briand-Kellogg Pact (1928). It was signed by most countries of the world. It should however be remarked that, as the war became illegal, signatories to the treaty started to invade other countries without declaring war. 61\u201365. Paris Peace Treaties (1947) between Allies, on the one side, and Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Finland, on the other side, formally established peace between these countries. The five allies of Nazi Germany had to pay reparations and, in some cases, surrender parts of their territory. 66. Treaty of Paris (1951), signed on 18 April by France, West Germany, Italy and Benelux countries, established the European Coal and Steel Community. 67. Treaty of Paris (1952), signed on 27 May, established European Defence Community. It never came into effect because France failed to ratify it (other five signatories did). Since Napoleon III, Paris has become a place for all kinds of treaties and conventions. I think people started coming to Paris to sign something simply because they liked to come to Paris.  Hawaii, Cuba and Philippines happy about US domination. An American cartoon, 1899 (left). An anti-Communist poster for European unity, 1951 (right). Ok. So these were the Treaties of Paris. Now comes an Appendix. As if 67 was not enough. Peace Accords: 1 (68).

Paris Convention (1858) united the Danube principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia into the United Provinces of Wallachia and Moldavia (later to become the Kingdom of Romania). The new country was to be an Ottoman vassal but to enjoy the guarantees of the Great Powers. 2 (71). Paris Monetary Convention (1865) established the Latin Monetary Union, bringing currencies of France, Belgium, Italy and Switzerland to the same bimetallic (golden and silver) standard. Later, Greece also joined the Union. Other countries (Spain, Romania, Austria-Hungary, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Finland, Serbia, Bulgaria, Papal States) did not join but tried to conform their currencies to the LMU standard. 3 (72). Metre Convention (1875) signed in Paris by representatives of 17 nations. The treaty set up an institute for the purpose of coordinating international metrology and for coordinating the development of the metric system. Ironically, United States were among the first 17 signatories. 4 (73). Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (1883) is still in force. It was one of the first international conventions on intellectual property, covering patent applications and trademarks. 5 (74). Paris Convention for the Protection of Birds Useful to Agriculture (1902) was the first international treaty on protection of birds. 6 (75). Paris Convention (1904) concluded by France and Spain specified the border between the French and the Spanish zones in South Morocco. 7 (76). Paris Convention of 1919 aka Convention Relating to the Regulation of Aerial Navigation decided that every country owns its airspace and demanded that all aircraft be registered in one country or another. 8 (77).

Paris Convention on the Organisation of International Expositions (1928) established the Bureau International des Expositions. 10 (79). Paris Convention on the Protection of Birds (1950) had a purpose to protect the birds in the wild state as well. 11 (80). Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy (1960) regulated liabilities and compensations in the case of nuclear energy accidents. 12 (81). Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR), signed in Paris on 22 September 1992. 13 (82). International Convention Against Doping in Sport which was adopted at the General Conference of UNESCO in Paris on 19 October 2005 and empowered the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).  Early aerial navigation Protocols: 1\u20134 (83\u201386): Protocols of Paris (1941), signed on 27 and 28 May between Vichy France and Nazi Germany, granted Germany facilities in Syria, access to a railway in Tunisia and to ports in Tunisia and Senegal. 5 (87): Protocol on the Termination of the Occupation Regime in the Federal Republic of Germany, signed on 21 October 1954 by West Germany, USA, UK and France, put the end to the occupation of West Germany. Charter: 1 (88). Charter of Paris for a New Europe (1990), signed by a number of European countries, USA, Canada and Soviet Union, served as a basis for the establishment of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  Occupation zones of Germany (left). Soviet stamp dedicated to the Charter of Paris (right).

This map indicates per capita responsibility for current anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere EDIT: Yes, in case there are question, I did not include any Treaty of Versailles (or Trianon, St Germain, Sevres, Neuilly, Meaux) to the list. Environs of Paris deserve a separate answer. EDIT 2: Thank you, Jesus Rueda Rodriguez and Bob Gluck for adding two more conventions to my list. ",

            "answer_text": "Rather than giving a straight answer (use Google for that) I am going to compound the issue. Throughout history there have been over a dozen 'Treaties of Paris' ranging from AFAIK the first one which ended the Albigensian Crusade in 1229; the one after that, ergo the 2nd Paris treaty, was concluded in 1259: between Louis IX of France and Henry III of England. After this second one \u2018Treaties of Paris\u2019 continue through the centuries till the most recent one establishing peace in the Balkans in the late 1990's. But now comes my compunding the issue: there are two more \u2018Paris treaties\u2019 literally called 'Second Treaty of Paris'. The 1783 one, which followed the \u2018First Treaty of Paris\u2019 which ended the American Revolution. This \u2018Second Treaty of Paris\u2019 was its ancillary between Great Britain and France, Netherlands and Spain ending their colonial disputes.The other 'Second Treaty of Paris' was in 1815, following Napoleon's defeat in Waterloo and resulting (amongst others) in the exile of Napoleon to St. Helena. This 'second' Paris treaty came after the 'First' Treaty of Paris concluded in 1814 between France and the Sixth coalition forcing the first abdication and exile to Elba of Napoleon.",
