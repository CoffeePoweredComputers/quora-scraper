            "answer_text": "Crime rates are always going to be proportionally higher in areas of greater population density. This was as true in the 19th century as it is today.  One of the obstacles to tracking data for Old West crime statistics has to do with the legal status of various territories and towns at the time during which a \"crime\" was committed. I placed that term in quotes to emphasize the idea that there were many instances wherein a town or territory established in the West was done so outside of the legal jurisdiction of United States itself. This is the basis for the perception of lawlessness. In such a territory you could kill another person in a barfight. It might not have been legal, but then again it wasn't illegal either. The U.S. legal system was technically inapplicable in these places.  Settlements were usually quick to realize that there had to be some modicum of law & order established in order to attract newcomers, so there was usually some expeditious effort spent on establishing a provisional legal authority in the form of a territorial governor or a sheriff. This latter job was - ironically - frequently filled by someone who might have been previously on the opposite side of civil order in a town, but was given the job anyway because he was the only person around who had experience in handling a gunfight or similar brouhaha.  It's also probably worth mentioning that while murder, robbery, rape, etc. are universal crimes, there were crimes which occurred in the Old West which were more or less distinctive to the region, and would have only rarely, if at all, been found in 19th century urban areas such as cattle rustling, claim jumping, or banditry (robbing trains and stagecoaches). tl:dr - Documented instances of 19th century crime were proportionally higher in urban areas than in Western settlements, and crime in general  most likely occurred with greater frequency as well. The West, however, was still quite \"wild\" and contained unique opportunities for criminal activity. ",

            "answer_text": "   Several years before his death, (I think it was during the mid 1920's but it might have been slightly earlier) Wyatt Earp was asked that question at a deposition regarding an inheritance of a woman who's mother or grandmother had been a citizen of Tombstone Arizona in the 1880's. Earp told the attorney that Tombstone, during the 1880's, the site of the famous gunfight at the OK Corral, was far safer than Los Angeles was at the time of the deposition. He noted that that the time he worked there there were only 1 or 2 killings and that in general it was safer to walk the street at night there than at night in Los Angeles.    In general, that does seem to be the case for settled towns. Moreover, with the exception of the one Bill Hickock street gunfight, there were no quick draw duels during the Old West. That was something manufactured by Old West novelists and early two reel filmmakers. There are numerous accounts of gunman shooting at each other but they did not square off in the middle of Main Street and fight by determining who could draw and shoot fastest.     The greatest dangers were probably during the brief interval that the Indian Wars took place. Other than that while there was violence, there was not the kind of unrelenting murder and violence you see portrayed in today's films.   ",
