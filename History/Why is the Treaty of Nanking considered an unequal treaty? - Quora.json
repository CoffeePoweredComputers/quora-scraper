            "answer_text": "When two countries fight a war, the winner almost always imposes conditions on the loser. The loser might have to hand over some territory, or pay money, or make some other concessions. Obviously, no country likes to lose. The treaty ending the war will often be resented. It is 'unequal' in that sense. However, the idea that it's somehow unfair or unjust for the winner to make demands on the loser seems to be a peculiarly modern concept. In many ways this is a good thing: if fighting a war of conquest to make gains from the loser is no longer morally acceptable, then the world will become a more peaceful place. But that's not how people saw things in centuries past. The Romans had an expression: vae victis, woe to the conquered. Fight a war and lose, and you must accept all you get. Next time, try winning.  The Treaty of Versailles was not resented in Germany because it was particularly harsh or unjust compared to similar treaties of the era \u2014 or for that matter to the treaties the Germans themselves had imposed on Russia and planned to impose on France and Britain had they won. No; it was resented because right to the end, the German people had expected to win the First World War; and it came as a sudden and horrible shock to them when they lost. They were angry and frustrated, and Versailles became a symbol of their humiliation. Much the same applies to China. Dai Qing was a powerful and imperialist state, which had conquered and spread its power widely over neighbouring countries over the last century. The official ideology proclaimed that China was literally the centre of the world, the Middle Kingdom; and even barbarians were expected to respect the authority of the Son of Heaven. So for a group of those barbarians to insolently sail right up to the Imperial capital and force the Emperor to make concessions to them was an immense humiliation because it was so unexpected. Dai Qing wasn't in the habit of losing wars, and it wasn't in the habit of signing treaties where it had to make unreciprocated concessions to another power. What was probably even worse for them was that after Britain signed the Treaty of Nanking, other European and American powers forced Qing to sign over similar concessions to them as well. Britain had at least defeated China in a war; the other countries simply extorted concessions by threatening similar wars if Qing didn't concede.  However, the actual phrase 'unequal treaties' (\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u6761\u7ea6) seems to have been coined in the 1920s \u2014 coincidentally the same time that Hitler was whipping up resentment against the Treaty of Versailles over in Germany. China was now a republic, and the Guomindang was in an uneasy alliance with the Communist Party. Opposition to European imperialism made a useful common cause that both Left and Right in China could agree on. The Opium Wars and the Unequal Treaties were thus made the focus of propaganda. China had suffered a 'century of humiliation' at the hands of the Western Powers, it was said, and so the Chinese people must support their government as it tried to strengthen the country and end the humiliation. This proved a successful strategy. Chinese history books under the later Qing and early Republic barely mentioned the Opium Wars and Unequal Treaties; they were a trivial sideshow compared to disasters like the revolts in Xinjiang or the Taiping rebellion. After the 1920s, though, they became the dominant narrative. There is one key difference between the German reaction to Versailles and the Chinese reaction to the Unequal Treaties, however. Inspired by Hitler, the Germans in the 20s and 30s blamed their defeat on scapegoats \u2014 the Jews and the socialists \u2014 and persecuted them. The Chinese reaction was more introspective; their own faults had caused their weakness, and they must improve to prevent it happening again. The Chinese approach was a lot less destructive than the Nazi one, at least as long as public anger was not focussed on internal 'enemies of the people'. They wanted to be treated as equals, not become a Master Race. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you out of your mind? The Treaty of Versailles was unequal enough to be a key mile stone on the road to WWII ! Hitler used it as the key justification for Germany\u2019s rearmament in defiance of its terms and when he repudiated it along with its terms for payment of reparation, the French and British did not even whimper - the severity of the terms of the Versailles Treaty turned out to be a double edged sword. Hitler indisputably started WWII but the idiots and punks who imposed the Treaty of Versailles on the German people laid the ground for WWII. Are you on some kind of crusade to label every treaty that was ever signed as \u201cequal\u201d and \u201cunequal\u201d? Or are you using Quora to make some kind of straw man\u2019s argument? I\u2019ll make the obvious point that treaties between victors and vainquished are inherently unequal because the victor are free to ask for whatever they want. ",
