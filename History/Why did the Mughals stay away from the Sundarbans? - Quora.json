            "answer_text": "Sundarbans is a part of the largest delta in the world which is formed by the rivers Ganga, Brahmaputra, and Meghna. The region is a swamp adjacent to both the plains and the sea and is intersected by several river tributaries, creeks, and canals. Although the topography makes the region unconducive for habitation, it is densely populated, with villages spaced around the edges of the forest. The Sundarbans is one of the largest mangrove forests in the world and takes its name from the dominant mangrove species, Heritiera fomes, locally known as Sundari tree. Mangrove forests are biologically productive ecosystems and Sundarbans, too, is home to a very rich floral and faunal diversity. The narrative of the reclamation of land becomes stronger in the pre-Mughal era which can be dated back to before the rule of the Muslim\u2013Indo Turkish, from AD 1204 to 1575 (Townsend 1987). During this time, the region is known to be inhabited by the Hindu Bengali caste of Pod in the west and Chandals in the east, who practiced fishing as a livelihood. However, it is believed that Muslim holy men, who established the Islamic religion in parts of Bengal between the thirteenth and the eighteenth century, played a significant role in the intensification of wet rice cultivation in Sundarbans in the thirteenth century, thus contributing to altering the natural forest ecosystem. There are accounts of abandonment of the region due to floods that led to the dislocation of many villages in 1584. Depopulation is believed to have continued in the following years and the region was overrun by forests. Sonia Shah in her latest article (The Print) writes that due to widespread cholera pandemic, Sundarbans remained largely untouched till the 17th century. During the Mughal period, the Mughal Kings leased the forests of the Sundarbans to nearby residents. ",
