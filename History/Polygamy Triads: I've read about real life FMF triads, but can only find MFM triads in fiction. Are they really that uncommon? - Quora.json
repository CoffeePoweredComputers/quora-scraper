            "answer_text": "The big question for me, is do you mean triad in the sense that they are a \u201cfull\u201d triad, where each of the three is in a romantic and/or sexual relationship with each other, or a \u201cv\u201d type triad, where two of the people are just friends with each other. The full triad doesn\u2019t happen as often, though it definitely does exist. To briefly digress: If we use the old Kinsey scale (which isn\u2019t perfect, but will do for this example), a woman or a man who is a \u201c0\u201d would call themselves heterosexual. A woman or man that are a \u201c6\u201d would call themselves homosexual. Then the differences happen. Through a mix of societal inclinations, pornography standards, and more, women who are a 1\u20135 on the scale will likely call themselves bisexual or at least bicurious. Men who are a 1 or a 5 are extremely likely to still say they are straight or gay, because of the social stigmas around bi men. Some of those stigmas around bi men lead to women not dating a bi man because \u201che\u2019s actually gay\u201d and men not dating that same bi man because \u201che\u2019ll probably cheat.\u201d Meanwhile, straight guys in general are happy dating a bi woman, because \u201cthat\u2019s hot,\u201d and while some lesbians won\u2019t date bi women (gold star lesbian and all that), it\u2019s nowhere near the flak bi men get. So, because of all of that, full FMF triads tend to be more visible and more common than full MFM triads. However, in my anecdotal experience, MFM \u201cv\u201d shaped polycules seem to be one of the most common arrangements, if not THE most common arrangement (tying with \u201copen web of partners\u201d which is less a specific structure because once you get past 4\u20135 people, each configuration is too specific to name). Now, taking into account the concerns about bi men above - is it likely that some of these \u201cv\u201d shapes are actually full triads? Almost certainly. While both of my guys are straight, they care about each other a lot. I\u2019m definitely not the only thing tying them together. If they weren\u2019t straight, we\u2019d probably form a full triad, but they are, and unless that changes, we\u2019ll be staying a \u201cv.\u201d ",
