            "answer_text": "For a moment, think like a movie or Broadway show producer: consider those items \u2018above the line\u2019 and those \u2018below the line\u2019. The latter are those items that are directly billable, such as rent on the hall, salaries, costs associated with the actual production. Former are the visible yet unmeasurable costs and benefits from putting on a show. Consider the below the line items in reverse order: Jefferson brilliantly itemized all of the injustices George III had visited on his colonies: quartering troops in private homes, insisting on raw materials being sent across the ocean to be processed into marketable products to be resold in America, Canada and other British possessions. I challenge you to read the list of \u2018He has\u2026\u2026.\u2019 that itemizes the American colonists\u2019 complaints. Now, above the line, think about what it will \u2018cost\u2019 those signers if the revolution fails: charges of treason, loss of life, liberty, property, freedom of movement, freedom of trade, status/standing/respect in the greater-than-England world. So let us respond to the question, what did the Declaration DO? Above the line: It announced a rebellion; it committed the colonies to support an insurrection against the world\u2019s strongest navy, a war against an established war machine that had defeated France and thus gained for its Empire all of Canada; it guaranteed a bloody struggle between upstart colonies and an international collection of treaties, commitments and alliances. Below the line: it abrogated all British obligations to \u2018serve\u2019 the colonies with guidance, protection from the Barbary pirates (ironically they named themselves the Mujahedeen). It ensured that all American/Colonial/United States\u2019 merchants, warships, diplomats and students anywhere in the world might be hung as traitors. The Declaration forced every person living in the colonies to make a choice, a hard choice and one that divided families, churches and towns. Jefferson\u2019s work meant the colonies would be on a war footing: recruits, organizing an army, strategic planning, preparing the populace for a bloody cause. In many cities, Loyalists outnumbered rebels. The agonizing dilemma for tradesmen, ministers, farmers and mechanics was to choose which side to fight on. By \u2018fight\u2019, we could mean taking up arms or it could be being bold enough to sell goods and services to the occupying army of George III or George Washington. What did it NOT do? It set up no system of government, no organizing principles and no direct call to action. The Boston Massacre was five years earlier, Patrick Henry\u2019s speech was already being circulated, as was the stirring words of Thomas Paine. Lexington and Concord had happened the year before. The Battle of Great Bridge, the shelling of Norfolk, the expulsion/escape of royal governors was a reality. What did it DO? It formalized what wise men already knew: war was here. ",

            "answer_text": "It stated the intent of the signers and the rebellion for the independence of the 13 colonies , an act of treason, they justified their treason as necessary because they claimed they had not been treated as full British subjects like those in England. To make Independence a reality they had to fight with the British Empire until Britain decided the war was costing too much and granted the US Independence. It was the predecessor of the articles of confederation and the Current US Constitution.It is not a relevant legal document today to the military oath, it has been superseded first by the Articles of Confederation and finally the Current US Constitution, the US military doesn't take an oath to it as I have people on Quora confuse it, with the Oath to uphold the Constitution. I have people on Quora tell me to read the Declaration of Independence that I took an oath to. Obviously they were not in the US military. ",
