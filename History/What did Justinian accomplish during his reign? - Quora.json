            "answer_text": "If you had the chance to ask Justinian himself, he would probably tell you his greatest accomplishment was the reconquest of many territories lost by the the former Western Roman Empire including north Africa, Spain, and most symbolically Italy and Rome itself. Justinian even conquered parts of modern Georgia that had never been part of the empire before. There is no real bright line between when the Eastern Roman Empire became the Byzantine Empire, but one way is to say that Justinian was the last Roman emperor because he was the last emperor to die ruling an empire that contained Rome. Justinian made a deliberate of \u2018renavatio imperii\u2019 or restoration of the empire, and no doubt hoped to be that generations of his successors would rule over an empire that he restored to its former glory. It wasn't to be, and his successor Justin lost most of the reconquered territory including Italy and Rome. Justinian's most lasting achievement was the much more prosaic work that became known as the Corpus Iuris Civillis (Body of Civil Law). This was a comprehensive project Justinian commissioned to compile all known sources of Roman law into one. The scribes overseeing this project we're authorized to make appropriate amendments to remove contradictions and confusions, and the result was a comprehensive legal code that would form the basis for Catholic canon law and much of medieval European jurisprudence. Justinian's code served as a major source for the Napoleonic code and other modern civil law codes. While Justinian failed in restoring the empire of Augustus, Marcus Aurelius, and Constantine more people and more territories are governed by laws based on Justinian's code than those Caesars ever ruled over.

            "answer_text": "Justinian I, or also known as Justinian The Great, and also Saint Justinian The Great by Eastern Orthodox Church, was an Eastern Roman Emperor from 527 to 565. His greatest legacy would be reviving the empire's greatness and reconquer the lost western half of the historical Roman Empire, as well as codifying Roman law into Corpus Juris Civilis, which is still the basis of law in many modern states. The impact of his administration extended far beyond the boundaries of his time and domain. Justinian's reign is marked by the ambitious but only partly realized renovatio imperii, or \"restoration of the Empire\". The reconquest of the territories of the defunct Western Roman Empire was mainly carried out by his general, Belisarius. He swiftly conquered the Vandal kingdom in North Africa, re-extending Roman control to the Atlantic Ocean. Subsequently Belisarius, Narses, and other generals conquered the Ostrogothic kingdom, restoring Dalmatia, Sicily, Italy, and Rome to the empire after more than half a century of rule by the Ostrogoths. The prefect Liberius reclaimed most of southern Iberia, establishing the province of Spania. These campaigns re-established Roman control over the western Mediterranean, increasing the Empire's annual revenue by over a million solidi. During his reign Justinian also subdued the Tzani, a people on the east coast of the Black Sea that had never been under Roman rule before. Justinian achieved lasting fame through his judicial reforms, particularly through the complete revision of all Roman law, something that had not previously been attempted. The Corpus forms the basis of Latin jurisprudence (including ecclesiastical Canon Law) and, for historians, provides a valuable insight into the concerns and activities of the later Roman Empire. As a collection it gathers together the many sources in which the leges (laws) and the other rules were expressed or published: proper laws, senatorial consults (senatusconsulta), imperial decrees, case law, and jurists' opinions and interpretations (responsa prudentum). He passed laws to protect prostitutes from exploitation and women from being forced into prostitution. Rapists were treated severely. Further, by his policies: women charged with major crimes should be guarded by other women to prevent sexual abuse; if a woman was widowed, her dowry should be returned; and a husband could not take on a major debt without his wife giving her consent twice. His reign also marked a blossoming of Byzantine culture, and his building program yielded such masterpieces as the church of Hagia Sophia, which was to be the center of Eastern Orthodox Christianity for many centuries. The Empire entered a period of territorial decline not to be reversed until the 9th century. As was the case under Justinian's predecessors, the Empire's economic health rested primarily on agriculture. In addition, long-distance trade flourished, reaching as far north as Cornwall where tin was exchanged for Roman wheat. Within the Empire, convoys sailing from Alexandria provided Constantinople with wheat and grains. Justinian made the traffic more efficient by building a large granary on the island of Tenedos for storage and further transport to Constantinople. Justinian also tried to find new routes for the eastern trade, which was suffering badly from the wars with the Persians. One important luxury product was silk, which was imported and then processed in the Empire. In order to protect the manufacture of silk products, Justinian granted a monopoly to the imperial factories in 541. In order to bypass the Persian landroute, Justinian established friendly relations with the Abyssinians, whom he wanted to act as trade mediators by transporting Indian silk to the Empire; the Abyssinians, however, were unable to compete with the Persian merchants in India. Then, in the early 550s, two monks succeeded in smuggling eggs of silk worms from Central Asia back to Constantinople, and silk became an indigenous product. ",
