            "answer_text": "Hi. Thanks for the interesting question. I have to start saying that the practice change from a continent, or a country, to another. There are very few and precise methods to preserve our heritage and too many ways to destroy it, also with the existence of very good laws. The first key to save monuments is the culture. I clearly don't mean a deep University culture but a society culture that start from the primary schools. It's a hard job cause they don't teach this things so often. More, if the government doesn't arrive (or can't) first, the population has the power and the voice to invoke the protection of the patrimony. After, public or private organizations (here the cases change from a place to a place) will collect a fund to preserve, with a real plan designed by specialized architects, restoring the whole object so to give many other decades of life, without any fear. Without a plan of restoration and conservation it's practically impossible to guarantee a long life to the most beautiful between the monuments. For example, in Japan they care very much about their historical heritage and they plan to spend a lot of money during many decades. In Italy, the country in the world that owns more monuments than any other country on the planet, as well as UNESCO sites, like Pompeii or ROME, just to mention a couple of names, has very strict laws and many offices that can manage a lot of power, also about the new edifications. They rule. The big problem is the money. When you have to feed too many kids, someone will starve. In New England and in the USA i noticed a curious attention to preserve the first places of the American culture. Nothing to say about it if just this would not fight, on the other side, with the failure to protect, in a important city like New York, their most beautiful architectural heritage from the IX/XX century. The space values more than the building in a place without space and the owners of the buildings use to create damages to the building itself so that it cannot be preserved. At that point the building will be sold and it will become a new space to build some s\u2026.y building for rich people. I was talking about the culture as a first method to preserve. When the money becomes the culture there is no space for a rich and successful preservation. It's a sort of giant and silent war, between great people that care about their past as something to pass to the future generations and other people that would destroy the past of a country just to make more money. See the Harlem situation and how Columbia University bought part of the area to make a bigger campus and more dormitories for they poor students. Columbia is the second real estate owner of New York City. A University as an investor in the land (they do the same in Boston, Harvard,etc..). They pay famous firms to make the dirty job erasing part of the Afro American culture from the streets of NY. I don't see a great difference with the acts of Talibans before the American occupation of their country. Everyone serve his own God. Name it. ",

            "answer_text": "Edit: oops! I read \u201cHow can historic documents be preserved?\u201d the below answer pertains to documents. Apologies. It really depends on what you\u2019re dealing with. Speaking generally, though, we can preserve them by storing them appropriately - paying attention to the air temperature, moisture levels & protecting them from light. We also should monitor for pests that can cause damage - insects, rodents\u2026 As well ensruring they are stored in acid-free materials to protect them from the other items stored around them - this could be acid-free boxes or paper separating each page, etc. And finally, ensuring that they are housed properly - that is stored in a way (flat, rolled, standing on shelves, not in over stuffed boxes or shelves, not stacked too many high, etc) that is appropriate for each item and on appropriate shelving or other appropriate storage furniture in a space where the environment can be monitored. If the documents are fragile or damaged, limit their consultation. If the contents need to be consulted, have a copy made by someone who is qualified to handle the documents and have all consultations of the contents be done using the copy. Educate yourself on proper handling of the items you are preserving and insist anyone consulting or viewing the items follows handling best practices - make sure you inform them on what those are. We call all of the above preventive preservation, which is intended to minimize and drastically slow down decay and damage. Different types of materials have different storage and handling needs. You could also have them assessed by a qualified conservator, who can prepare a report on the condition of the documents and make recommendations for their storage and preservation, as well as identifying any mold or moisture, active pests or pest damage, or other issues that should or could require treatment, and recommendations for treatment options.
