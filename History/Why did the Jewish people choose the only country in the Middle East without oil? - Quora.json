            "answer_text": "We had the belief that we were returning home to our lost empire. We \u201ckept the flame lit, or carried the torch\u201d for all this time. One of our main Hollidays. We could have lived in peace with the Palestinians, but they tried to \u201cpush us into the sea\u201d meaning exterminate us, with the help of other armies, more than once. Did we have the right to move to this land? Is it ours? Social Darwinism lost favour after the World Wars. Our weapons are too deadly. So might makes right isn\u2019t popular any more. I don\u2019t know if there are any people on Earth who don\u2019t have their land by killing, but North America and the Natives is a great example. But back to the question. We didn\u2019t want oil, we wanted to go home, and it was right after the Holocaust. All sorts of ancient communities in Greece, Italy, and other places are gone forever. If we don\u2019t have our own land, we will die. Many communities all over Europe are gone forever, like the \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d. PS If we could bring back an Indian from the dead, and tell him that we are nice now, we call him a Native, I think, with his murdered family and culture, these words would mean little to him. ",

            "answer_text": "The Jews\u2019 Creator chose this land. No mortal. Jews Were the Chosen people. Chosen to bring The Law (10 Commandments), into an evil, dark, lawless world. Jews by birthright, Not mortal mandate, Own this land. There was/is No Palestine. Palestine was a British invention. Jerusalem is King David\u2019s City. An Eternal capital city-the heart of Israel. The Jews have returned to Their land after 2,000 plus years of wandering. They will Not be forced out ever again. But their many enemies still think this is possible and continue to fight against these people. Instead of cooperating with Israel to Everyone\u2019s benefit: growing the desert green, making/building a modern society, healing and educating All peoples and praying in Peace, Israel\u2019s enemies continue to live in hatred and ignorance, sick and dying, by the score.
