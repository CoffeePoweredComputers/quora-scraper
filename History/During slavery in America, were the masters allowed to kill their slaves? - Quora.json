            "answer_text": "N one simple answer, YES. Slaves were considered PROPERTY. However when the importation Of new slaves was outlawed. On March 2, 1807 Congress legislated that the importation Of slaves would be illegal. It took affect by the earliest date that the constitution allowed. The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves of 1807 (2 Stat. 426, enacted March 2, 1807) is a United States federal law that stated that no new slaves were permitted to be imported into the United States. It took effect in 1808, the earliest date permitted by the United States Constitution.[1] Promoted by Thomas Jefferson since at least the 1770\u2019s. This is how Thomas Jefferson President of The United States of America pitched it to Congress. Passage of the Act Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Speech to Congress. I congratulate you, fellow-citizens, on the approach of the period at which you may interpose your authority constitutionally, to withdraw the citizens of the United States from all further participation in those violations of human rights which have been so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa, and which the morality, the reputation, and the best interests of our country, have long been eager to proscribe.[8][2] The House and Senate agreed on a bill, approved on March 2, 1807, called An Act to prohibit the importation of slaves into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States, from and after the first day of January, in the year of our Lord, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Eight. The bound measure also regulated the coastwise slave trade. President Thomas Jefferson signed the bill into law on March 2, 1807.[9] Many in Congress believed the act would doom slavery in the South, but they were mistaken.[10][3] The role of the Navy was expanded to include patrols off the coasts of Cuba and South America. The effective date of the Act, January 1, 1808, was celebrated by Peter Williams, Jr., in \"An Oration on the Abolition of the Slave Trade\" delivered in New York City.[11][4] Now that the International Slave Trade (Atlantic Slave Trade)[5] was neutered, shall we say, the Price of each Slave increased dramatically. So this alone would give Plantation Owners some Pause. Footnotes[1] Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves - Wikipedia[2] http://Passage of the Act\tEdit  On December 2, 1806, in his annual message to Congress, widely reprinted in most newspapers, President Thomas Jefferson denounced the \"violations of human rights\" attending the international slave trade and called for its criminalization on the first day that was possible (January 1, 1808). He said:  I congratulate you, fellow-citizens, on the approach of the period at which you may interpose your authority constitutionally, to withdraw the citizens of the United States from all further participation in those violations of human rights which have been so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa, and which the morality, the reputation, and the best interests of our country, have long been eager to proscribe.[8]  The House and Senate agreed on a bill, approved on March 2, 1807, called An Act to prohibit the importation of slaves into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States, from and after the first day of January, in the year of our Lord, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Eight.

            "answer_text": "Technically no, but in practice, it was usually allowed. Straight-up murder of a slave was illegal, and there are a handful of cases of a particularly careless or stupid slave owner getting himself hanged for murdering a slave. This generally required that a) you killed the slave in front of white witnesses, b) you did it in such a shocking and brutal way that that even a white witness jaded and inured to routine cruelties against slaves was so shocked that he told the sheriff about it, and c) the sheriff wasn\u2019t in the slave owner\u2019s pocket. This was a very rare combination of circumstances. Even once that was done, getting an all-white jury to convict was often impossible - not one single case in Missouri, although prosecutors tried several times. Convictions and even executions of slave owners for murdering slaves did happen, but I have found fewer than ten cases in all of U.S. history, as compared to thousands of documented cases of owners killing slaves and who knows how many undocumented ones. There were also many circumstances in which it was legal as well as easy for an owner to kill a slave; runaways who refused to surrender could generally be killed outright, and an owner was generally not criminally liable for whipping a slave to death, provided that he did not purposely intend to kill the slave and the punishment was not grossly excessive in comparison to the norm for the area - and the local norms were usually so brutal that the master could get away with the killing. So, due to weak and nearly unenforceable laws against it, killing a slave was extremely easy to get away with. Usually the only practical deterrent was the economic loss to the slave owner, not the legal system. The abolitionist and escaped slave Frederick Douglass wrote of seeing a slave shot dead by an overseer for refusing to submit to a whipping, and concluded, \u201cIt was a common saying, even among little white boys, that it was worth a half-cent to kill a \u2018nigger,\u2019 and a half-cent to bury one.\u201d ",
