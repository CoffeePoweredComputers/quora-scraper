            "answer_text": "While I greatly admire the Chinese Civilization and their contribution to the history of the world, India undoubtedly had a greater impact on the world including China. Think of all the core philosophies of Chinese Culture. All have roots in Buddhism. Guess where the roots of Buddhism are. India was the original land of opportunities. So many cultures and communities found refuge from persecution here. These cultures would be lost in time if not for India. Countries like America, Indonesia were colonized due to India. Imagine a world without zero or the decimal system. Imagine a world without Chess. Imagine a world without Spirituality. India has affected the history of every single country in the world and it\u2019s contributions are irreplaceable. ",

The nation has had a greater impact on history are Britain and France. These two nations along with few more nations has affected numerous countries and millions of population for at lease a couple of centuries.
