            "answer_text": "I like the H&K MP5. I\u2019ve never been in combat, don\u2019t have any desire to be either, but I\u2019ve fired MP5s, Thompsons, Uzis, MP40s, MP34s, MP38/42s, ERMAs, PPSH41s, Grease Guns, STEN Guns, Vz 25s, VP70Zs, M2 Carbines, and once a selective fire Walther PP at machine gun shoots. The MP5 was tops in my opinion. Mostly because the others were from WW2 and fired from an open bolt. Let\u2019s just say that they weren\u2019t designed for accuracy. The MP5, on the other hand, was smooth as silk and you could keep it right on target. Shooting them is fun fun fun! Shooting the others was fun too, but the MP5 was spectacular. I\u2019m not certain that there are a lot of people manufacturing machine pistols anymore, I can only think of the MP5 offhand. I don't think they\u2019re really relevant in warfare today, so the MP5 is easily on top for that reason as well. ",
