            "answer_text": "Do you mean to say the \u201ccolonial Europeans favor the Japanese over other non-Europeans\u201d. During the colonization era, the East Asians were not treated any better than the other Asians. East Asians were segregated and labelled as \u201cPeople of Color\u201d in many places including Apartheid Africa with the exception of Japanese who are labelled as honorary White. East Asians were unable to receive the American citizenship until 1900s. The same goes for Australia where all PoC including East Asians could not receive citizenship. The only Asians that are treated better than the rest were those that are mixed with Europeans (Half Caste) or adopted Christianity. But they are still considered PoC and void of many special privieges that the Whites received. Japan managed to learn from the West, industrialize and catch up with the West through the Meiji Restoration before it was colonized by the Europeans and took part in the colonization process. Japan colonized Korea before the Europeans had any chance and this result in Korea not being colonized by the Europeans but it was colonized by Japan. Aside from Japan, the rest of Asia was not as advanced and developed. Mongolia served as a buffer zone between the Russian-Central Asia and the British colonized India and hence was not colonized. China served as a buffer zone between British India and Japanese colonies. The Europeans managed to colonize Hong Kong and Shanghai and have attempted to colonize the whole China through the Opium War and carving out of territories. The other reason is that East Asia was not as affected as it was located far away from Europe. By the time Europeans manage to reach East Asia, they have already had colonies in Middle East, Africa, South Asia (except Nepal and Bhutan), Southeast Asia (except Thailand), the Australia and the Americas. As for Europeans bringing \u201cEast Asians to Southeast Asia and they receive special treatment\u201d, this is a myth. The Europeans do this to all races, not just East Asians. The Europeans have a policy of bringing in non-native people to their colonies to function as a Middle Man. For Hong Kong, the British brought in South Asians as the Middle Man. For Myanmar, the Rohingya was brought in as laborers to Western Myanmar. For Malaysia, the British brought in the South Indians and South Chinese. For Formosa, the Dutch and French brought in Chinese migrants. For America, the Africans were brought in as laborers and slaves. The Middle Easterners were brought in albeit in a smaller extent. Therefore, it was not exclusively East Asians and it was exaggerated. The Middle Man role was not exceptionally for East Asians but for any race that are not native to the area and considered different race, but usually not the same race as the Europeans. The Europeans did not treat East Asian specially. The British had a slightly better perception of East Asians, they mention East Asians appear to be more civilized as they have lighter skin and don\u2019t eat with their hands. Nevertheless, they are treated as People of Color and seen as such. The ethnic Chinese and non-Christian Filipino tribes in Philippines were labelled as the Lowest Caste by the Spaniards unless they adopted Catholicism and change to Spanish names. The same goes for other colonies with the exception of Middle Man which any race can become as mentioned above. In general, the Asians were not treated much better and were considered People of Color unless they are descendants of European or partial descendants of European (Half Caste). Only the Asians who are mixed with Europeans or adopted Christianity are considered as Higher Caste than the rest of Asians but they are still not considered White. By the end of colonial era, the Europeans held higher regards of only two countries in Asia and that was Japan and Thailand. Japan had Meiji Restoration and Thailand had Sukhothai policy. Only these two Asian countries escaped the Western colonialism by Western countries and/or joined the West in Colonialism as the case of Japan. The rest of uncolonized Asian countries escaped European colonization as they either had no natural resources, functioned as buffer zone, partially colonized, colonized by other Asian countries or were almost colonized. Such was the case of Nepal, China, Mongolia, Korea etc. But they were in no way favored by the Europeans than the rest. ",

            "answer_text": "Colonial Europeans, like most of humanity, respected only what they could fear. East Asians produced a certain number of powerful Empires that were at least powerful enough to be a pain in the ass to conquer. It does not mean they would have been equals. There are stories of Chinese christian converts discovering that the US was not much respectful of them despite they had the \u201cright\u201d religion, or the complete paranoia because there were too many Chinese in some cities. But still, they were given a privileged position in the immigration laws compared to some other groups, they were getting more consideration. People respect what they have a potential to fear, and there are good chances this maxim will remain valid for millenia over and over. This is why \u201cempowerement\u201d matters so much. It\u2019s useless to ask people to have some moral sense, they won\u2019t retain one for long. It\u2019s useless to ask people to be outraged about stuff since when you do that, you put yourself entirely dependent on their good will, which they can retract whenever they feel like. When people are just a little scared, they get more respectful. It\u2019s like dogs or deers playing intimidation games. Humanity is not terribly different from other animals. China in particular used to be despised. They were a retrograde Empire, then they were a war-thorn Republic and then they turned commie, which was just asking to be an outcast for many. But look at this, now that they are doing a comeback, everyone is licking their feet and now the Orange Agent speaks of being tough with China. At the risk of surprising some, Europeans were not \u201cnever\u201d acknowledging sovereignties that were not their own, even if the people was nomadic, they were not having one consistent policy all over the world. This is for example an interesting passage from the Franco-English Commission that was created to try to find an agreement over their American claims. At some point, they were discussing the issue of the Carribean indigenous from the island of St. Lucy, that for some years had their sovereignty acknowledged (yes, it could happen): \u00ab Sans entre dans la question si l\u2019on devoit regarder les Sauvages Cara\u00efbes comme des possesseurs l\u00e9gitimes, il est certain que tant qu\u2019ils ont eu la volont\u00e9 & la force de disputer le terrein, aucune nation Europ\u00e9enne n\u2019a pu se vanter d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements de la guerre pouvoient lui enlever d\u2019un moment \u00e0 l\u2019autre \u00bb \u201cWithout entering into the issue of wether one should look at the Carribean Savages as legitimate possessors, it is certain that as long as they had the will & the strength to dispute the terrain, no European nation could brag of having a property that the events of the war could remove at any moment\u201d (Source : SECOND M\u00c9MOIRE des Commissaires du Roi, Sur l\u2019isle de SAINTE-LUCIE, du 4 octobre 1754, En r\u00e9ponse au M\u00e9moire des Commissaires de Sa Majest\u00e9 Britannique, du 15 Novembre 1751 \u00bb, id., p. 44 et 53\u201354.) I guess it\u2019s revealing of what were the conditions for Europeans to respect foreign sovereignties. They did observe the Carribean sovereignty on St. Lucy until 1763, because in the past they were capable to put up a fight (in 1640 they even had defeated the English and denied them access). They stopped because precisely, there were not many Carribeans anymore, and therefore were not having the strength anymore. They could not be feared anymore, therefore they could not be respected anymore. Europeans respected those who displayed willpower and strength to counter them, and despised those who did not. This is why only Ethiopia, China and Japan got their seats in the League of Nations and basically no one else. Of course, I think you would agree a case like India doesn\u2019t count since it was basically a British puppet back then, or any of the mandates. The Empire of Japan, when dealing with France in her colonies of Indochina, was at some point outraged to not be treated like Europeans (because they looked too similar to the Vietnamians or Cambodians and so were sometimes mistaken for them). They protested to France and France eventually instructed these colonies to treat the Japanese just like Europeans, and so the Japanese were in a privileged category at the harbours of French Indochina. Japan demonstrated the will to not be treated like crap and had at least enough strength to make itself known as troublesome to anger. In the beginning of WW2, the US didn\u2019t take Japan seriously. So they depicted them as inoffensive monkeys that didn\u2019t know what to do with modern weapons. It turns out they knew damn well how to use them, so now they were turned into fearsome gorillas in the US comics. Now they were worthy of more respect. ",
