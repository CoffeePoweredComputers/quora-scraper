            "answer_text": "Troll alert? Probably had more to do with the decay of ancient egyptian societies over time, the rise of rival power centers, the degeneracy of the various dynasties due to inbreeding and incestuous marriages, and a lot of other stuff. And who knows: perhaps ancient Egypt had no women fortunate enough to look like Gal Gadot? Ancient societies could be advanced and technologically sophisticated given the state of knowledge and the physical tools and materials available. But non could be considered high tech in our understanding of the term. As for references to multiculturalism and Detroit, it's ok with me if you want to ask : Is the decline of DETROIT a result of multiculturalism? ",
