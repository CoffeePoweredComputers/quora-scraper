            "answer_text": "It\u2019s Dongbei not Manchukuo (or Manchuria) Today, that region is called Northeast China or Dongbei (literally East North) in Mandarin Chinese. Manchukuo is the Japanese name of the ILLEGITIMATE PUPPET STATE in Dongbei. China would never give Dongbei back to Japan since it is not Japan\u2019s to be given back in the first place. It was sovereign territory of China that was illegally invaded and occupied by the Japanese. And China sees its sovereignty over the region as absolute. China giving the Japanese Dongbei is about as likely as them giving Qingdao back to the Germans, Hong Kong back to the British or the Japanese giving China Kyushu. In a hypothetical world\u2026.Japan would not want it anyway But in a hypothetical world if China did decide to give Dongbei to Japan they likely would not even want it. Back in the 1930s when Dongbei was conquered by the Japanese it was an almost untouched land of resources of all kinds. They were needed for Japan to become a fully modernised industrial nation given how resource poor Japan is. And Japan back then was still a mostly traditional country - the architecture, clothing, cuisine, technology and overall way of life for most Japanese had more in common with its past than the lifestyle of the elites in Tokyo. Today, Japan is a fully modernised industrial nation. It\u2019s people live a life completely different from its traditional one. Even the ones in rural villages have paved roads, modern houses and cars. Thanks to global trade it has access to all the natural, energy and agricultural resources it needs. Its managed to become a confident, technologically advanced, futuristic nation through global trade. And Dongbei now is the opposite - it\u2019s natural resources are almost depleted and as a result the region is now an economically backwards, poor rust belt region. It suffers from high unemployment, stagnation, population outflow, low birth rates, high debt levels, pollution. Japan\u2019s occupation of Dongbei was brutal\u2026..Chinese would hate it The legacy of Japanese imperialism is negative in China and especially in Dongbei. It was on the outskirts of one of Dongbei\u2019s largest cities, Harbin, that Unit 731 was built. They performed biological experiments and used Chinese people as targets or materials for weapons experiments. They infected them intentionally with lethal diseases, used them in bomb experiments as live dummies. Most cruelly for those infected with diseases, so the Japanese could observe how the virus infected a body and the immune system responded they would vivisect (cut open) Chinese people, some of them children and pregnant women: ALIVE, FULLY AWAKE and with NO ANAESTHETIC. The Unit 731 Museum in Harbin gives a detailed look into the full scale of the atrocities the Japanese committed. And so low they thought of the Chinese that they referred to their human test subjects as Maruta (meaning tree log in Japanese). The Japanese also infected surrounding villages with viruses too for the same reason. Chinese would protest both inside and outside of Dongbei. Why is the Chinese government giving sacred Chinese territory \u2026\u2026 to JAPAN!. The Chinese government would be seen as not defending Chinese sovereignty and its people. If the Chinese government was crazy enough to even consider it they would back away immediately following mass protests. This would threaten the Communist Party of China\u2019s legitimacy and rule over China. So why would China and Japan want a region with only negatives So why would Japan want another region that\u2019s resource depleted, suffering from many of the economic and demographic issues lots of regions in Japan are experiencing, that would saddle them with even more debt and filled with a hostile population almost equal in size to Japan\u2019s population. And why would China want to give away a region that could result in mass protests, weakened legitimacy and even a threat to their right to rule. Non existent hypothetical But all this is ultimately just hypothesising and it can only go so far because in reality the situation is almost completely implausible. China would never give it away. And Japan doesn't want it. ",

            "answer_text": "There are so many in Japan who lost (disappeared without any information of alive or dead) one or two relatives in each of some family in the turmoil of 1945. So the government of Japan and some people would establish searching project of those who lost in Manchukuo. But maybe too late because it is a sad story 75 years ago. And some Japanese may claim the possession of the land and buildings their ancestor bought and built. They may feel that they are robbed their properties by KMT or Soviet. About 3,000,000 Japanese could do nothing but escape or be caught there. That north east part of China is one of the centers of military and heavy industries, so if those properties are regarded as valuable ones, negotiantions of taking over of them between governments could be curious one. And no surrounding countries around North Korea effectively aiding the people in that country sending painful everyday life. Manchukuo has population of about 400 millions so it could easily save those people, and a similar event like the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 could happen and eventually maximize their life level standard. But I just do not want to offend people already living there. What I can do is telling historical facts one by one and confirm the response from the audience. -- Is it appropriate to talk that how Japanese old leaders thoughts (illusions) and the minute parts of Lytton Commission report?? The report said that special area were rightful result of Japan because Qing Dynasty paid little interest, and also said that the Europe countries and USA should reign that vast area together with Japan, so Mr. Matsuoka chose honorarily withdraw from the League of Nations (\u56fd\u969b\u9023\u76df) even though Japan was one of the five main member countries (as a \u5e38\u4efb\u7406\u4e8b\u56fd) in 1933. Manchukuo was established as `\u6771\u6d0b\u306e\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab (Eastern America in translation?) ', and that idea was invented by a genius military operator who wrote \u2018\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u7d42\u6226\u8ad6\u2019 (\u201cThe theory of final war in the world\u201d in a translation) that theoretically predicts the collision between Japan and USA. That book contains fun scientific predictions, and may contain a lot of hints to answer your question. If that area is returned to Japan, they may try to realize the part of ideal notions of `Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\u2019 (\u5927\u6771\u4e9c\u5171\u6804\u570f), with the attempt to reduce its disgrace. And...ok, ok, such things can easily cause difficult arguments and I am not so sure about complicated history.. ",
