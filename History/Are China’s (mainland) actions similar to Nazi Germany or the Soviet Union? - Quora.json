            "answer_text": "Are China\u2019s (mainland) actions similar to Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union? Internally? Yes. This cannot be denied. Internationally? No, not really. China operates internally in more-or-less the standard authoritarian manner. The freedoms of their citizens are curtailed, the populace is closely monitored by the authorities, politically inconvenient individuals disappear, and communities that are identified according to racial, religious or ideological differences to be \u201cundesirable\u201d are rounded up and put in \u201cre-education\u201d camps. The USSR and Nazi Germany operated in very much the same way, as have (and do) a number of other authoritarian regimes around the world. In terms of international relations, though, China is quite different from the USSR and Nazi Germany. China seeks to engage economically with the world around it. It has certainly expanded its territory by military conquest, but it doesn\u2019t seem very interested in conquering and holding large numbers of client states in the way that Nazi Germany and the USSR did. In many ways modern China seems to have learnt from the example of the USA who, whilst they have definitely fought their share of wars, mainly dominate the world by economic and cultural means. It seems that China wishes to do the same. ",

            "answer_text": "Can a state system that protects territorial integrity be called authoritarian? I have noticed double standards in assessing such phenomena among people living in Euro-Atlantic countries. If the Spanish government resists separatist tendencies in Catalonia, it is not authoritarianism. Or the British government prevents the separatism of the Irish and Scots. Or the Ukrainian government prevents separatism of the Crimea, Donbass, using the army. This is not authoritarianism. But if China or Russia also behave this way, it is authoritarianism. Any government by its very nature is obliged to fight for the self-preservation of the state. ",
