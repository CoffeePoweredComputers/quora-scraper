            "answer_text": "Because Portugal at the Kings' times and the Republic's time, the objective was never to create colonies but to expand as Portuguese borders and expand the Portuguese language, as colonies were considered as overseas provinces or administrative regions that were part of the Kingdom of Portugal and then more afternoon of the Portuguese Republic, as we still have the example of Madeira and the Azores, which are autonomous regions and integral parts of Portugal. We also have to see that the Portuguese empire lasted almost 600 years was the longest of modern empires, and there were empires that did not even last 100 years and therefore that word colonies was not part of the Portuguese constitution.
