            "answer_text": "Oh, you Americans and your bizarre interpretations/justifications for being. Tiger Woods May well be the first \u2018sportsperson\u2019 to become a billionaire, but there is no way he is an \u2018athlete\u2019. By definition he would need to be proficient and competitive in one or more sports in the field of \u2018athletics.\u2019 One could never describe John Daly as an athlete, nor Jack Nicklaus or Craig \u201cwalrus\u201d Stadler. Great sportsmen, yes; athletes, no. But Americans being Americans, think it okay to redefine words to suit themselves. Athletes being one example and billion being another. I doubt that even Tiger is a billionaire by the original numerical value of 1 billion being equal to 1 million, millions. And speaking of American word bastardisation and sport: \u201cWinningest??? Where the hell did that come from??? ",
