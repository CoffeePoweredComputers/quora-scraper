            "answer_text": "Yes, most likely. Proto-Uralic is suggested to have originated somewhere near Lake Baikal and the Sayan Mountains around 3000 BC. The early Uralic people were closely related to other Siberian and East Asian people. But during their migration they have assimilated and mixed with several Indo-European groups (among others).  This map seems to be rather accurate. The small area north of Mongolia is the proposed homeland of proto-Uralic. Linguistic evidence point to strong contact with Mongolic and Turkic but also other Siberian languages. Later they were also in contact with Indo-European languages (mostly Slavic and Iranian). Several proposals suggest that they are closely related to various other Siberian (and norther American) languages, such as Yukaghir, Eskimo\u2013Aleut, possibly Nivkh and Chukotko-Kamchatkan. Here the most supported theory: Uralo-Siberian:  (An interesting fact is that some suggest that the Ainu language is in fact related to this family. But the strange thing is that according to the authors, the Ainu language was not the original language of the Ainu people, but was adopted. \u2192 This means the Ainu language is not the language of the ancient Ainu. Thus most do not agree with the inclusion of Ainu. A similar concept was promoted by the Japanese linguist Kanehira Joji. He suggested that the Jomon language was mixed with Uralic and formed the Ainu language. Maybe\u2026 at least influence of Uralic on Ainu.) There is also strong genetic evidence. Mostly all Uralic speakers today have East Asian and Siberian genetic components which are absent from other Europeans. Even modern day Hungarians have 4% to 12% East Asian genetic ancestry. There is also haplogroup N:  This lineage originated in northeastern China and is common in Turkic, Uralic and other Siberian populations. It has also a medium distribution among some southern Chinese groups as well a weak distribution among Inuits of northern America. Recently a genetic, archeologic and linguistic study published 2019 proposed that the Uralic languages and its speakers originated in eastern Siberia. Than about 3,000 years ago, one Uralic branch arrived in the Baltic area and parts of modern Finland. The Hungarians, the Magyar branch, arrived later in central Europe. Similarly another study, already in 2018, analysed autosomal DNA and found that mostly all modern Uralic speakers share genetic components which originated in eastern Siberia. They further concluded that all Uralic speakers have some East-Eurasian ancestry and that the spread of Uralic languages involved at least some demic component. The proto-Uralic people likely looked like this modern Uralic people:    While modern Finns or Hungarians do show both West-Eurasian (Caucasoid) and East-Eurasian (Mongoloid) ancestry components (with the first being predominant):  According to anthropology, the East Asian ancestry can still be found in central Europe:  The closest relatvives of Hungarians (at least linguistically) are the Khanty and Mansi people, which still are in Siberia:   (Khanty people)   (Mansi people) Conclusion: Yes, the ancient (\u201coriginal\u201d) Uralic peoples were/are Mongoloid and from East Asia or Siberia. As noted above, there is possibly Uralic influence on Ainu, which makes this family much more interesting for me. ",
