            "answer_text": "Which two US states have no border states next to them? I am assuming you are not looking for Alaska and Hawaii, which are not part of the contiguous United States. So I am assuming you mean which states do not abut a state that touches Canada, Mexico, or water that forms an international border including the Pacific Ocean, The Atlantic Ocean, or the Great Lakes other than Lake Michigan. If so, here is a map I colored: Black X = Touches an international borderRed O = Touches a border state I see three states, not two NebraskaKansasMissouriBut if you count Lake Michigan as an international border that turns Illinois into a border state and that drops Missouri into abutting a border state. So now there are only two. NebraskaKansas",

            "answer_text": "I would echo what others have stated, which is that this question has no clear answer as stated. To get it down to only two states, you have to make a lot of what I think are unreasonable assumptions about what constitutes a \u201cborder state\u201d. If we take it in the most technical legal sense, we only include states with international borders over land or internal and territorial waters. This list would consist of Alaska, Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Anything beyond this is stretching the definition in my opinion. Then the states that are next to these border states are Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, South Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois (water border with Michigan), Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island (water border with New York), Massachusetts, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Colorado. I would also include most of the border states listed above since they are next to other border states, with the only exception being Alaska. So our list of states that are next to border states has 37 members, leaving 13 that would qualify for this question: Alaska, Hawaii, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia.
