            "answer_text": "A good candidate might be the Greek dramatist Euripides (484 - 406 BC). Two quotes from \"next door\": http://www.answers.com/topic/euripides  Unlike Aeschylus and Sophocles, Euripides made his characters' tragic fates stem almost entirely from their own flawed natures and uncontrolled passions. In his plays chance, disorder, and human irrationality and immorality frequently result in apparently meaningless suffering that is looked on with indifference by the gods. and  A critic of society, Euripides was a serious questioner of the values of his day. As a realist, he often placed modern ideas and opinions in the mouths of traditional characters. [\u2026] Euripides felt for all classes of people and was particularly sensitive to the humanity of women and slaves. He studied female psychology with an acute eye and with unbelievably powerful perception. Euripides also could and did probe religious ecstasy, dreadful revenge, and all-consuming love. As a rationalist, Euripides was relentlessly attacked by conservative Aristophanes and accused of being an atheist. Euripides treated myths rationally and expected men to use their rational powers. The bottomline: Euripides refused in general to show \"gods taking action\", which is an insult either way: either they didn't care (jerks) or they were not able to intervene (no power). Also, instead of awesome plotting, he loved to use Deus ex Machina in order to get the story finished and the people out of the arena. This shows a lot of nasty disrespect for the olympic inhabitants - but that's just my interpretation.  However, I'd say the accusation of atheism by a well known \"colleague\" of his time might have some weight though. ",

[1]    Sage Kapila, the founder of the Samkhya school of dualist Indian philosophy is the first notable atheist in other parts of the world, most likely.  The major text of this school of thought comes from roughly 200 CE, but in an interesting case of co-discovery, Sage Kapila lived at roughly the same time as Diagoras, around 550 BCE.
