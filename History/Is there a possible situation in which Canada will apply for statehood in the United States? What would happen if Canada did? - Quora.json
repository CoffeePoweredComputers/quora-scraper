I for one am a Canadian and would never never in a million years want to be an American. I have seen similar questions like this in Quora and it is still a really stupid question far as I am concerned. SInce I am giving a response I may as well continue then Ok first off we do not have the same amount of mass shootings in Canada as the US does yes we do own guns in Canada but we also have very strict gun laws as well. There is a reason why you need gun control so people don\u2019t go on a killing spree. Second I like our single payer healthcare system it\u2019s not perfect but it works I had my appendix taken out you know what I paid for a week in the hospital absolutely nothing I have had numerous hospital visits and still did not cost me anything at all. In the US healthcare isn\u2019t even considered a basic human right gee I wonder why that is oh I know must be all those politicians that make money off of healthcare Thirdly I love living in Canada we have our own culture and we are very welcoming to other cultures Fourth reason we don\u2019t go invading other countries just because we need to start another war with another country!!! since world war 2 how many countries has the US invaded? well let\u2019s see there was Vietnam I have no idea why the US was involved in that one at all there was also the korean war in a nutshell the US always has to be at war with somebody I could go on further but I think that is enough already.

It\u2019s just incredibly, INCREDIBLY improbable. \u201cWhat would happen if they did\u201d? Well, they\u2019d need to be broken up into a few other states (Ontario-Saskatchewan, BC-Alberta, the Maritimes-Newfoundland, Yukon-Nunavut-NW Territory [remaining a territory due to tiny population or merged with Alaska]. Quebec would likely refuse and become its own country. A lot of Canadians would either be REALLY angry or, due to some horrible situation, still really angry that their identity was being erased and sad that such a horrible event had transpired. Then, they\u2019d need to change all the provincial constitutions/charters into republican charters. Then, after Congress admitted them, the additional 27 million people would REALLY shift the voting patterns of the US. ",
