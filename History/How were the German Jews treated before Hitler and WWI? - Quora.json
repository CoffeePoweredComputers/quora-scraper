            "answer_text": "In the late 1800s till the end of WWI if you told a European that a European country was going to try to wipe out the Jews, there first guesses would be : Russia, Poland or France. Russia, and Poland had a long history of antisemitism, and pogroms. After the 1870 Franco-Prussian war, a French Jewish officer Dreyfus was convicted of spying for the Prussians. The trial, and retrial, tore France appart a long political lines. Most consevatives insisted he was guilty, most liberals believed him innocent. How many believed this because they knew the facts, or because of party loyalty, or their feelings towards Jews I don't know. It turned out the real spy (a non Jewish officer,) framed Dreyfuss. Interestingly enough, a similar thing happened in post WWI Germany. Towards the end of WWI Ludendorf (who was dictator in everything except name,) told the liberal government the army was finished, have to make peace. They put out feelers to see what terms would be offered, they didn't like what they heard. Back to Ludendorf they went, and asked if he could hold out until they could get better terms, Ludendorf told they take the terms. After the treaty was signed Ludendorf told everyone that he, and the \u201cundefeated\u201d German army, were winning the war. It was the liberal politicians (who everyone knew were \u201cJewish\u201d) that stabbed the army (and true Germans) in the back. He was able to getaway with it because, for the last two years of the war, he determined what news the public received. They were told that their glorious army was going from triumph to triumph. Then suddenly they were told they lost, and the only way that could of happened was because they were betrayed. After that things became harder for the Jews. The short answer was while there was still antisemitism, the best European countries for Jews were Germany, and Austria. They were able to leave the ghettos, enter any career they wanted, and assimilate. Many of them started thinking of themselves as German, or Austrian first, and Jewish second if at all. Fat lot of good it did them. ",

            "answer_text": "The removal of civil disabilities on Jews in Germany began in the early 19th century in Prussia (1812), but it was a piecemeal process and did not apply to all spheres of life. (The process had begun earlier in some provinces of the Austrian Empire earlier, such as Bohemia and Galicia, while Jews were entirely banned from some provinces). In most of the German states most civil disabilities were removed by about 1850. However, some occupations, such as the civil service - highly prestigious in the German states - remained closed to Jews till 1918. It is generally said that the German Jews soon made use of the new opportunities and many of them enthusiastically and successfully embraced modernity. For example, Reform Judaism began in Germany (mid 1820s on). Also, c. 1820 the birth-rate among Jews was generally somewhat higher than in the rest of the population, but from about 1870 on the German Jews tended to have fewer children and give their girls better education, which improved the position of women. The rest of the population didn\u2019t catch up till about two-to-three decades later. When women were admitted to the universities on a regular basis, the proportion of Jewish women among the female students was relatively high. In 1918\u201319 the few remaining disabilities were removed and in the 1920s (and early 1930s) Germany was not a country that international Jewish organizations were worried about. There were occasional pogroms, especially early in the period c. 1815\u20131900, but on the whole the lot of the Jews in Germany from about 1815 till the Nazis came to power (1933) was regarded as good by comparison with many other European countries.
