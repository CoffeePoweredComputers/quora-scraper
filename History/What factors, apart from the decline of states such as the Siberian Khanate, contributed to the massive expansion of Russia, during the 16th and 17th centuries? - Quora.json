            "answer_text": "A good question. Actually, it is a question why Russia is so big. Okay, it was already big under Vasili III, the Great Prince of Rus\u2019, who united all Eastern Rus\u2019 lands (Western Rus\u2019 stayed under the power of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania). But it was under his successors that Russia became absolutely enormous.  In green: Russia at the moment of Vasili III\u2019s death (1533). In orange: territories conquered under his son Ivan the Terrible and his grandson Feodor (1533\u20131598). Does this aggrandizement seem enormous? Wait until the next map  Here you are. In the next 90 years after 1598, Russian explorers (shown in red arrows) sailed almost all the Siberian rivers and crossed many forest and tundra areas. All yellow territory was claimed for Russia (green is what Russians controlled in 1598) In 1552, Ivan the Terrible conquered the Khanat of Kazan\u2019, one of the remnants of the Golden Horde. The road to Siberia lay open. In 1581\u20131585, Yermak, a Russian adventurer hired by the Stroganov merchant family, conquered the Khanat of Siberia. The first Russian city in Siberia, Tyumen\u2019, was founded in 1586. In 1639, just a half century later, Russians reached the Pacific Ocean, more than 6,000 km eastwards. In 1652, Russian and Chinese armies met for the first time. How did such expansion become possible? One reason is already stated in the question: after the seizure of Kazan\u2019, there was no one to oppose Russian expansion in Siberia, no barrier. However, it does not explain the vigour of the Russian explorers. According to my friend, a Russian nationalist, the answer is obvious. Poetic Russian soul needed great spaces. Russians just could not stop before coming to the Pacific Ocean. However, for all poetry of my Russian soul, I cannot completely agree with him. I believe there were two main reasons for this expansion and both of them originate during the reign of Ivan the Terrible. First, it was under Ivan IV the Terrible that Western European merchants (English, followed by Dutch and French) discovered Russia. Before that, Russia had to trade with Western Europe through its land neighbours, Poland, Lithuania, Livonia, Sweden and Denmark, and traded with little profit. The direct trade route changed the situation completely. This new trade was immensely profitable to both sides. An English ship made a gain of 100% in one trip to Russia, and left Russians happy with the good bargain they made. One of the main Russian export commodities were the furs. Easy to transport and store, extremely valuable, they became Russia\u2019s oil of 16th century. At the first stage, they were also very easy to get. Russian explorers in Siberia hunted for furs themselves or demanded tribute in furs from the locals. However, as fur-bearing animals became scarcer, explorers had to move eastwards. And it went really fast. While Yermak\u2019s expedition to Siberia reminds of conquistadores, later Russian explorers can be compared to the Canadian and American fur trappers. However, there was another reason. Ivan IV was nicknamed Terrible not for being nice and respectful. He instituted the Oprichnina as a terror regime that allowed him to concentrate the power in his hands and destroy his opponents, real or perceived. He devastated Novgorod, the second largest city in Russia, probably killing hundreds of people. After the death of his childless son, partly because of Ivan\u2019s actions, partly because of a climate change, Russia was plunged into one of its worst crises, the Time of Troubles, an all-encompassing civil war, that raged for more than a decade. What could the people do to escape hunger, to escape war, to escape increased taxation? They could go away. So they did. People from Novgorod, a citadel both of democratic traditions and of explorers, could play a great role in this eastward movement. They breathed the air of the Pacific Ocean and felt safe because the central authority was really far away. ",

            "answer_text": "During the XVI and XVII centuries, Russia experienced a mounting pressure from Poland in the west and Crimean Tatars in the south. Both enjoyed supremacy in weapon and military organization, and Russia needed something to compensate for that. Czars tried to address the challenge by expanding the taxable base for the state budget. The proceeds would be used for boosting the number of troops and buying better weapon. This period coincided with a price spike for some traditional Russian export items\u2014especially furs. In the XVII century furs became a true money machine for Russia, and laid the economic ground for its spectacular rise as a major European power in the XVIII century\u2014much like the wealth accumulation that happened at the same time in the New England. The agents of this expansion were mixed gangs of Slavs and Turks operating in the fringes of Russian territories. They became known as cossacks. They followed the business model brought to us by Vikings. Relatively small armed groups used their superior military organization, mobility and simple logistics for recurring raids on aborigines and claiming taxes in kind: furs, slaves, and other easily movable colonial commodities. The newly acquired control of the entire trading route along Volga (Baltic Sea to Persia) allowed Czars to claim a large part of their loot as state taxes. Subsequently, more and more of these groups were employed as state officers, both in their military and tax-collecting capacity. State-run fortresses proliferated farther and farther east as logistical hubs and fortified locations of their permanent office. ",
