            "answer_text": "Age alone does not determine value. It may play a role in determining value but is never the only factor. An item\u2019s value is contingent on two things: supply and demand. Some years ago, a client of mine had roughly 40 pre-Colombian artifacts, mostly vessels and objects d\u2019art all dating from 1492 or earlier. Their age was confirmed by scientific analysis. Altogether I valued the collection at less than $5,000. My valuation was based on where comparable pieces had sold in recent years on the secondary market. One might think the item\u2019s would have greater value considering their age and the limited supply on today\u2019s market. But there was also a fairly limited demand for such items, keeping sales prices in check. I don\u2019t think I valued any one item for more than $600.  ",

At the same time, having a trained, experienced, discerning eye can enable you to identify the Antiques of the 22nd Century now. An example of that is LaVerne tables, which were made in small quantities about 40 years ago, and are already being prized by collectors. That was one I nailed. but as I say, there \u201cain\u2019t no equation\u201d. ",
