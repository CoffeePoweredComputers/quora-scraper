            "answer_text": "Currently I would say that it is Christians. So many Christians have such a big lack of understanding of Christianity, but they don't keep quiet. In the passage about the pharisee and the tax collector praying in the temple, most Christians identify themselves with the tax collector, but most actually resemble the pharisee. Christians protests against abortion, homosexuality, etc. and sadly this seems to be mostly mean protests. Christians also get into heated arguments with nonbelievers. We protest but we don't provide alternatives. It is easy to tell a scared and stressed out pregnant girl that adoption is a better alternative if you are going leave her to her own means for the nine months that she will have to carry the child she is going to give away. Christians use passages like the one about the splinter in the eye to defend themselves instead of learning from it. When Christians go against the following, they just do damage. 1 Corinthians 13:1-\u202c2 ESV If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. Jesus drew crowds to him, he had to occasionally go hide from people or get on a boat to have some alone time, but modern Christians mostly turn people against Christianity. Christianity is supposed to be about positive actions, but it has become more about negative preaching and condemnation. The world of today hates Christianity because of the actions of Christians. ",

            "answer_text": "Reason and logic are the biggest enemies of Christianity. Christianity attempts too many logically contradictory concepts. For just a few examples: It has one god that are three gods, or three gods that are one god. Take your choice. One of it\u2019s gods is a loving benevolent god who has a mythical history of anything but benevolence to humans. That god is an all-powerful all-knowing god whose mythical history is mostly about correcting his prior actions. All of Christianity\u2019s gods are omniscient, yet apparently unable to anticipate the effects of their actions. Furthermore, their worshipers must speak to them aloud to be heard, at least on occasion, and they can sometimes hide their actions from the gods at least temporarily. One of the gods came to Earth, as a sacrifice by another god, to save us from some unidentified consequences of our unexplained sins. But, he brought us an eternal hell to burn in as a consequence of our sins. Thank you Jesus. This sacrificed god spent three years out of at least 6,000 working petty miracles to convince humans that he could save them from something they would not have had if not for the other god (original sin). We are supposed to look upon this murder of one god by another god as a horrible event that is our fault. Yet, the pain and horror of this murder was puny in comparison to the misery that is inflicted on humans routinely by cancer, ALS, and various maladies that can give humans years of suffering. Furthermore this sacrificed god knew that he wouldn\u2019t stay dead long. And, he had the power to alleviate or avoid pain. Wasn\u2019t it all staged by the all-powerful, all-knowing, murdering god? There is a fourth near-god, the Devil, that we can blame for anything that is not the fault of our own free will. The Devil is not an all-powerful deity, but he is close enough that none of the all-powerful ones can control him. This makes the gods that hold us strictly accountable, accountable for nothing. The third god, the holy ghost, always existed, as well as the second. But, they only chose to reveal themselves during the three years of the introduction of Christianity. The third god would seem to be superfluous except for the limitations of the other two omnipotent, omniscient gods. One could also question the necessity of the sacrificed god, if the original god was completely capable. The introduction of Christianity and two of the gods was mostly a result of the other god changing his all knowing mind once again. He apparently decided that it was a mistake to just tyrannize and terrorize Jews, and that all humans should benefit from his love. Study of the history of religion from Sun-worship to Scientology reveals that religion generally evolves from the simple and more logically consistent to the more complex, logically inconsistent, and ridiculous. Modern Christianity is evolving away from its holy book and the myths that created it. It is becoming some sort of will\u2019o\u2019wisp of the love of some god who embraces and is tolerant to all. Perhaps it will disappear up its own fundamental aperture. Let\u2019s just hope it takes its damned churches with it. ",
