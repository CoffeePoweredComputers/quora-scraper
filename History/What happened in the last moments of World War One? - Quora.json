            "answer_text": "What happened in the last moments of World War One? The war to end all war was one of the most costly conflicts in history of war which over 16 million died. Total number of both civilian and military casualties is estimated at 37 million. The last moments of the Great War, was just as deadly\u2026 On 11 November 1918 the fighting during WW1 would come to an end following the signing of the armistice, with it coming into effect at 11:00 hrs. However, men were still being killed right-up to the final moments of the war. I'm going to try and describe how each one (with a little, how I saw it) tragically lost their lives in them final moments. Augustin Tr\u00e9buchon: Private Tr\u00e9uchon, 40, a soldier in the French 415th Infantry Regiment; he joined the fight in 1914 and could have been exempted because he had a family to support. Tr\u00e9buchon was a dispatch rider and he was given a message to deliver to his captain's position, which was two kilometres away from the command post (CP) he was at. Before he departed, I can see him saying to his mates, \u201ckeep your heads down. The war\u2026 be over soon.\u201d With good natured replies of, \u201cYou to Tr\u00e9buchon.\u201d and \u201cYou to, you owe me money.\u201d Tr\u00e9buchon also tells his hungry mates, \u201cThere's going to be soup for all.\u201d Which receives loud cheers and back slapping. Off he goes on his way to deliver the message; which reads: \u2018muster at 11:30 hrs for food\u2019\u2026 I'm sure he was thinking, that as soon as he gets back to the CP, he'll be having some hot soup. As he goes through some village, \u2018RAT-TA-TAT' a machine gun opened up on Tr\u00e9buchon; it's 10:45 hrs on 11 November 1918\u2026 No soup for Tr\u00e9buchon.  George Lawrence Price: Private Price, 25, a soldier in the Canadian 28th North West Battalion. The Canadians had just taken the Belgian village of Havr\u00e9, which is on the outskirts of Mons. On a side note, I'd like to add that if I was there I'd be keeping my head down during those final minutes of war. According to accounts, it was said that Price is the one who suggested the patrol go and search some buildings down the narrow canal of Ville-sur-Haines, to see if any Germans were hiding there. The patrol are cautiously moving through the village, alert and with rifles at the ready; keeping to the cobbled street. They cross a small stone bridge and carefully approach the back door to one of the cottages in the village. Having arrived at the cottage, everyone has taken cover; tentatively scanning their arcs. Except for a couple of heavily armed soldiers standing-guard with their backs resting against the wall to the entrance of the property. They do this to cover Price because he's about to send the door crashing in with a boot. With the door now off its hinges, they all bomb-burst into the room, to be greeted by a frightened Belgian family, that are huddled together around a kitchen table, \u201cLes Allemands sont partis.\" - \u201cThere's no Germans here.\u201d they say. All-of-a-sudden, just as the patrol relaxes momentary, a machine-gun from somewhere outside opens-up; the bullets ricocheting off the brickwork. Price then suggests they go outside to see what's going on. He leads the way, but once outside he's horribly exposing himself too harm. Suddenly, a solitary shot from down the road; belonging to that of a rifle, rings out - \u2018BANG'. Price is hit in the heart\u2026 some accounts say a pretty young lady from another house came rushing out to Prices' aid, but to no avail; it's 10:58 hrs on 11 November 1918\u2026 Price is killed instantly.  Henry Gunther: Private Gunther, 23, a soldier, in the US 313th Infantry of the Liberty Division, and was the company's runner; at 10:44 hrs he was delivering a message to his squad. The road at a crossroads is blocked by a barricade, which is being manned by a German machine gun section. They're all in excellent spirits, as the war will be over in sixteen minutes and making small-talk about what they'll be doing once they become civilians; just to make time pass more quickly. Suddenly, one of the German soldiers sees a sudden movement coming from the shadows of the war waste littering the road from out the corner of his eye. They're now all keeping an eye on a figure who's dressed in an American uniform. The machine gun section is get more and more nervous by the figure who's aggressively approaching them. They fire a few warning shots in the air and shout in broken English shout, \u201cGet back\u2026 war over soon... get back!\u201d Gunther, throws himself to the ground, then starts to \u2018leopard' crawl through the mud towards the roadblock. He stops, slightly turns onto his back so he can fix his bayonet onto his rifle. Then he suddenly rises and bayonet changes the roadblock, yelling and firing his rifle as he does, \u201cAGGHH!!!\u201d Not far away you've Gunthers' fellow American comrades watching what's starting to look like a scene from a horror film unfold in front of them. They're shouting for him to stop this lunacy. The Germans are also opened mouthed and bewildered by what's happening and they continue to shout, \u201cGet back. War almost finished!\u201d and \u201cWar is Kaput!\u201d The Germans are look at each other, totally dumbfounded, \u201cDoesn't that madman know that the war is almost finished.\u201d Sadly, with no other alternative they'll have too open fire. As Gunther charges, he feel his heart pounding, the adrenaline has kicked in.Then, \u2018RAT-TA-TAT', a hail of bullets strikes his chest; it's 10:59 hrs on 11 November 1918\u2026 Gunther is killed instantly\u2026 11:00 HRS - ARMISTICE. When he'd lost his Sergeant strips as the company's supply sergeant he became sullen and withdrawn into himself. All he had done (yes, different times) was write letter home to a mate to say how bad life in the trenches was and urging him not to join (the censorship read the letter.) Maybe, as he was German-American he thought writing that letter made him unpatriotic and he had a point to prove, so that's why he changed. Gen John Pershing, chief of the American Expeditionary Force, officially recorded Gunther as the last American to die in WW1 and awarded him the Divisional Citation for Gallantry and got his strips back.  The Soldier, Rupert Brooke: If I should die, think only this of me: That there\u2019s some corner of a foreign fieldThat is for ever England. There shall be In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware, Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,A body of England\u2019s, breathing English air, Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home ",
