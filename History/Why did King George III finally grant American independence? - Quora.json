            "answer_text": "The North ministry - Wikipedia finally fell in a vote of no confidence on 27 March 1782 succeeded by the conciliatory Second Rockingham ministry - Wikipedia. The King followed Parliament. The Ministry of Lord North: January 1770 - March 1782 The traditional scapegoat for Britain's loss of the American colonies has been George III on the grounds that his bungling and arrogance caused the friction in the first place. Then his incompetence lost the war. The accuracy of this view is questionable George III was responsible only in that he supported his parliament was people in what initially was a popular warLord North did ask to be allowed to resign several times, especially after Saratoga (1777) and after France's entry into the war (1778) in favour of someone with more experience. The king refused to allow North to resignparliament and the people supported the war, with the exception of the Rockingham Whigs who saw parliament as the revolutionary body and the Americans as defending their rights as EnglishmenIn a letter to Burke in 1775 Rockingham said The violent measures towards America are fairly adopted and countenanced by a majority of all individuals of all ranks, professions or occupations in this country The pro-war lobby included the country gentlemen, the Universities, the Anglican clergy, John Wesley and the Methodists, Adam Smith, Gibbon, merchants, traders and most ordinary people. The anti-war faction from the very beginning of the difficulties included the Rockingham Whigs and the Chathamites (led by Chatham until his death in 1778 and then by Shelburne thereafter). By 1778 the size of the opposition to the war had increased and continued to do so as Rockingham was proved to be right about the predicted outcome. Fox and Burke spoke in parliament against the American war. North's ministry was the first ministry to face the full force of public opinion, opposition and criticism, as the war slid towards defeat for Britain. 1776 saw the publication of a vast amount of democratic literature in Britain which was increasingly influential. Also in 1776 it became clear that North's ministry was likely to have problems with Ireland. In 1778, the French declared war on Britain, marking the beginning of a global war for the British. North then had to deal with the demands of the English provincial country gentlemen when Christopher Wyvill established the County Association in 1779. In 1780, the Gordon Riots added to North's troubles. In America things went from bad to worse and North's nerve broke even though he had a majority in the general election of 1780. His ministry fell because of the final failure of the American War, especially after the fall of Yorktown in 1781. North wrote in his diary, \"Oh God! It's all over.\" He was worn out, exhausted, deserted in the Commons and he felt that he could not carry on. In March 1782 George III reluctantly accepted his resignation. North went into the Commons to announce that he had resigned and went straight to his waiting carriage with the comment, \"Sometimes, it is good to be in on the secret.\" ",

If his country hadn\u2019t been heavily mired in debt after the French and Indian War, and His Majesty had not decided to tax the colonies as a result, it might not have happened as it did. But colonies didn\u2019t take kindly to that , especially when they got no say in how they were governed. King George wasn\u2019t the most mentally stable and that did not help. He went downhill fast after the Revolutionary War. ",
