            "answer_text": "Royal men like kings and princes probably did have sex with lower class women often, but they gave them status very rarely because it\u2019s not as if peasant women had any power to protest when they were taken to bed or when they were discarded, so other than a very few, we don't know their names or who they were or how they met. The simplest explanation would be that a woman would be noticed through proximity and if the king liked what he saw, he would take her to bed. Of those common women that we do know about, they tended to be beautiful, tenacious and intelligent. Theodora, the 6th century Byzantine empress, was supposedly a bear trainer's daughter and her mother was an actress and dancer. Writings on Theodora's early life varies wildly according to how much the writer hated or liked Theodora or her husband, Justinian I. In any case, it seems that she did grow up in the acting industry at least, and she probably was also a prostitute since prostitution went hand in hand with acting at the time. Being good at comedy, she would perform at private parties for the rich and powerful. She met Antonina, the wife of the bodyguard and future General Belisarius at one of these parties. Theodora soon became the mistress to Hecebolus, the governor of Libya, and stayed with him for four years. She was apparently mistreated by him and abandoned in Libya. She traveled to Alexandra, Egypt where she converted to Miaphysite Christianity, then went to Antioch then back to Constantinople. In Constantinople, according to a writer, she apparently gave up her old lifestyle, becoming a pious wool spinner. It doesnt jive with what really happened though, because she had to meet Justinian, and she could only do that if her life intersected with Justinian\u2019s, and the best way to do that was performing at a private party. Theodora and Justinian began a relationship and the two had a daughter together, whose name is unknown. Justinian wanted to marry Theodora but couldn't because the law forbade it. Even though Justinian was once a peasant himself, he was now his uncle, Emperor Justin I's heir and the class difference was too great. So Justinian solved the problem by convincing the Emperor to change the law and he married Theodora. It was horribly scandalous but they powered through and the two unofficially co-ruled the Byzantine Empire until Theodora's death at the age of 51 from cancer.  Herleva, the mother of William the Bastard, Duke of Normandy and future King of England, may have been the daughter of a peasant named Fulbert who may have been a tanner, but his job title from the time is ambiguous and could have meant furrier or embalmer or apothecary. Historians suspect that he couldn\u2019t have just been a lowly peasant, but a burgher instead, someone who had some influence on the function of the town of Falaise, because his sons, William\u2019s uncles, were signatories to a document with a young William, not usually a responsibility given to lowly peasants. Herleva herself was seen as respectable because later on, she was made guardian of the Count of Flanders\u2019 daughter. It's also possible that class status was just that much more fluid back then in the 11th century because it didn't matter much to contemporaries that William himself was a bastard, only that he could win and hold Normandy, then England through might. In any case, no matter what Herleva's background was, it is clear that she was not anywhere close to being of the noble or royal class. Her father's job is usually given as tanner because of the legend of how Herleva met William\u2019s father, Robert, Duke of Normandy. She was stomping on leather in a dying vat below the castle walls and had her skirts raised to keep them out of the dye. Robert was up on the wall looking down and when she noticed he was there, she picked up her skirts just a little higher for his benefit. He was interested and sent her a summons. She was to be hustled into the back door and then sent back out when he was done. She didn't want this so she refused to go until he received her through the front gate, on horseback. So Robert negotiated with Herleva's father, who agreed and dressed her in her finest clothes and sent her to the Duke on horseback. By this point, everyone knew what was going on and Herleva had her foot in the door. After bearing William, Robert married her off to one of his noblemen and she had two more sons with him. Another possible way that Herleva met Robert was through being the mistress of a lesser nobleman, Count Gilbert of Brionne, who introduced her to Robert and she then became Robert\u2019s mistress. In the 17th century, the low-born Nell Gwyn was mistress to King Charles II. Nell's mother's was known as Madam Gwyn and she ran a bawdy house or brothel in London and Nell's father was unknown. That's about as low-born as you can get. She has been given several jobs, none of which have been proven, ranging from prostitute, bawdy house servant, street hawker of things like herrings, oysters and turnips, cinder-girl (a reference to the Cinderella story?), then mistress to a man named Duncan. Duncan paid for Nell's rooms and may have helped her get a job at a nearby theater. Perfect timing because when Charles II was restored to the throne after the austere, Puritan Cromwells, he brought back the theater and also lifted the ban against women working as actors. The theater had always had men or boys playing both male and female parts up until then. The job may have also come from a friend of Nell's mother, Moll Meggs, who employed Nell and her sister in selling sweets and fruits to customers in the theater. They also passed messages between customers and actresses backstage. Less than a year later, Nell became an actress at the ripe old age of 14. She was beautiful, witty and had a good voice. She was trained to act and dance by the other actors, and her best roles were in comedy. Charles II came to the theater often and must have known of her at the very least. A couple years later Charles II left London because of the plague and took some actors and actresses with him so he could have his own private theater and Nell was one of them. Later when the plague stopped and the regular theater opened again, 17 year old Nell became the mistress of Lord Buckhurst and stopped acting until the affair was over. When she returned to acting, the Duke of Buckingham saw her and decided to try and replace the King's current mistress, Barbara Palmer, with Nell in order to have more influence over the king. Nell asked to be kept for 500 pounds a year, which was rejected as too expensive. But about a year later, she was watching a play in a box next to the king, who started flirting with her and thereafter she became one of his principal mistresses. She had two sons with the king and the oldest was made an earl. The king died when Nell was 35 years old and he made sure she was provided for with 1500 pounds a year until she died 3 years later from strokes and internal bleeding.  In the late 17th century, a orphaned peasant girl named Marta Helena Skowro\u0144ska was adopted by an aunt and sent to became a servant to a pastor in Poland-Lithuania. She may have gotten married to a Swedish dragoon at age 17, and may have gone to work for the Russian soldiers as a laundress when the Russians pushed the Swedish out. Things are murky this early in Marta's life. Eventually, she became part of Field Marshal Boris Sheremetev's household and traveled back to Russia with him as either his servant or mistress. From him she was transferred to Prince Alexander Menshikov\u2019s household. It is unsure if she was a servant or mistress to him. In any case, the prince was the best friend of Czar Peter the Great and when Peter visited the prince's home in 1703, he met Marta and made her his mistress. Marta gave him a son and changed religions from Lutheranism to Russian Orthodox, also changing her name to Catherine. They married in secret in 1707 and they eventually had 12 children together. They were very affectionate and Catherine would always follow Peter on campaign. He married her officially in 1712 and she became Czarina. In 1724 she became co-ruler and when Peter died in 1725, Catherine became the ruler of all the Russias as Catherine I until her own death two years later from tuberculosis at 43 years old. Of her two surviving daughters, Anna and Elisabeth, Elisabeth eventually became Czarina.  So it is possible, but rare, to rise to the top like these women did. Most primarily, their lives would have to intersect with royal ones and the best way to do this was to either be in close proximity, like being a servant or being in entertainment, and secondly, they would have to be able to hold onto the royal\u2019s attention for years.

            "answer_text": "It depends what kind of mistress you are thinking of, and how high ranking you are talking. Many royals of the Renaissance Era and Early Modern Era had a maitresse-en-titre, an official mistress whose job it was to be a kind of hostess, and oftentimes they came from the high nobility itself. Louis XIV\u2019s longest standing mistress was a lady called Athenais de Rochechouart, Marquise de Montespan and she came from a major noble family in central France and was very well accustomed to the upper class lifestyle. You wanted the official mistress to be able to comport herself like an alternative queen. Of course Louis had other more casual mistresses as well who were also from the nobility and one\u2019s from the bourgeoisie and the lower classes, usually servants of the higher ranking women he slept with. His cousin King Charles II also had a similar setup, except he had more of a harem, with a set of Duchesses, countesses, actresses and their servants all living in different apartments in Whitehall Palace, where he had access to all of them. As you went down the ranks of nobility, it was fairly common for noblemen to have a mistress either from the lower nobility or the ranks of the bourgeoisie, and maybe more casual dalliances with servant girls and prostitutes. It was very rare for a King to take a mistress from a brothel, and Louis XV invited scandal by falling in with a prostitute named Jeanne Becu, who he ennobled as the Comtesse du Barry. It was considered much worse that she was from such a base background than the actual fact of him having a mistress! In the Medieval times, there is not really as much evidence of a culture of having an official sort of courtesan in Northern Europe, the way 17th and 18th century Kings did. Then, it was more likely for a king\u2019s mistress to come from the middle or lower classes, such as King Edward IV\u2019s relationship with Elizabeth Shore, who was the daughter of a merchant. In southern Europe, some of the Italian princes would take an official mistress, and they tended to come from slightly more exalted backgrounds, and their children would be considered part of the princely family. Also, in some parts of Medieval Europe, liasons between men and women of the upper class as equals (in the sense that the woman was not being kept by the man as a courtesan/hostess) seem to have been more commonly talked about, though not accepted, and you read about Byzantine empresses and other queens openly taking lovers of a similar rank. So the answer could be very different depending on what part of your question is being addressed, and of course you occasionally hear about a prostitute becoming a mistress of a king or even a queen herself. But in general, a serious relationship with a monarch or a noble generally required that individual to have a certain modicum of status, wealth, and breeding, or else usually they were consigned to casual hookups ",

            "answer_text": "It was not particularly common for medieval royalty to have lower class mistresses. Lower class than them certainly, but not lower class. The relationship between king and mistress, though it could not be formalized due to Christian monogamy, was often just as much a political tool as a marriage. Many lesser nobles and other influential individuals (financiers, knights, etc.) were quite pleased with the influence that they gained when a woman in their family became a long-term sexual partner of the king. They encouraged it, lobbied for it, and, predictably enough for men who saw women as property they could trade for power, demanded it. In societies that accepted polygyny, the same thing happened, but it was called marriage. What you are calling \u201cmistress\u201d was called \u201cjunior wife\u201d where that was legal. In addition, medieval kings simply were not surrounded by that many truly lower class individuals. Courts were insular places, and even many of the women working in the immediate vicinity of the king came from some minor noble family from the countryside. Why wouldn't the tens of thousands of such families try and angle for that prestige? Now, if you're asking if medieval kings had sex with lower class women, I\u2019m sure they did\u2014both consensual and not. The castle or war headquarters could be a brothel if the king wanted it to be. But there would be no record of the relationship, the women wouldn't even have gotten the quasi-formal name of \u2018mistress\u2019, and any children of these lower class women fathered by the king would have remained forever unacknowledged\u2014and unsupported. Kings only had to give some sort of recognition when the family had political importance. The birth of a child was often when the relationship became acknowledged. Otherwise, no. The path from brothel to mother of an acknowledged bastard given a name and lands was extremely rare. ",

Taking a mistress from a brothel would be disastrously extreme: noblemen usually recruited one from among their domestic servants. Kings were surrounded by a court, quite a large body of people. Their mistresses were generally selected from among this number: any good looking woman who turned up at court for whatever reason would be pounced upon. Two royal mistresses, Nell Gwyn and Mrs Jordan, were actresses. The theatre was not a respectable career choice for women: the tendency of such women to be available for hire was so notorious that, before Nell Gwyn\u2019s time, only boys were allowed to play women on stage.
