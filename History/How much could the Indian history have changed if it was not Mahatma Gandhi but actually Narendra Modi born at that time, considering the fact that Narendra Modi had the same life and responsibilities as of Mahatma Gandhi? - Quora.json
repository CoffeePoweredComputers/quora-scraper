            "answer_text": "Mr. Modi can never be Mr. Gandhi. This is an speculative question good enough for movies. Or you are trying to equate Mr. Modi with Mr. Gandhi. Mr. Gandhi was not a politician. He never asked votes in Ram. Ke. Naam. It appears to me that most of Indians do not realise , that no sense in making Temples for politicians. Mr. Modi is trying to have museum of Prime Ministers. Was Baapu. looking for publicity? I suppose you know which side was RSS during Independence? Lots of news says that they were helping British. Nathuram Godse was with RSS who shot Baapu. If Mr. Modi was there during the period of Baapu.he would have approved lynching. Baapu fought with Ahimsa. Baapu never had same life as Mr. Modi. For Baapu it was not responsibilities. It was his dream. It was his ambition and hard work. There can be no second Baapu. Trivial : Baapu.was a lawyer. Can you say same for Mr. Modi A platform already exists for Mr. Modi. He did not initiate it. ",
