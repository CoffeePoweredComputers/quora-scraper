            "answer_text": "Peace to all, (Smile), the Canaanites were Canaanites because of the land that they were citizens of was call Canaan; not that Canaan is a race or ethnic group. Just as blonde haired blue eyed people are Africans that live on that land but, their race is Caucasian. The people of Canaan are here with us right now but because that land is no longer called Canaan the people are no longer called Canaanites. The Nephilim are the children of the rebellious lot of angels that followed Lucifer / Satan and yes that bloodline is still here with us today. They were never twenty feet tall. The giant refers to power just as GM, Ford and Chrysler are giants in the automotive industry. Also the original man is on an average five foot nine. However when the fallen (rebellious) angels whom are also men with flesh and blood but are on a higher level mentally and physically because their minds and bodies had never experienced the sin that we live in daily started having sex with the less enlightened general masses, genetics started to go wrong. Like when close relatives start to reproduce or even if a 40 year old would reproduce constantly with a twelve year old. Men started being born six feet and over but never reaching over eight feet tall and these, are the other spectrum of the giants. Other things also like bone, blood disease and deformities were the results of this angel and general masses mix. The flood was never meant to stop wickedness, just slow it down. Lucifer, in his transformation into Satan and not from human to spirit but from righteous to one whose evil spreads and affects others, secured time with GOD to try to show his wicked wisdom superior against the Throne and turn man against GOD, Genesis 3, Job 1:6 - 12 & Holy Qur\u2019an 2:34. Note Iblis and Lucifer are the same. Later down the line Lucifer\u2019s descendant came along and secured six thousand years for wickedness, Exodus 34:21, Genesis 32:24 - 32, Job 2:1 - 10. When GOD permits the entire population will be stripped of the false and incomplete knowledge you have now and all will be blessed to see the truth. Peace to all. ",

            "answer_text": "If the Canaanites were the last of the Nephilim, how did they survive the flood? One thought may be that the genetic information was carried in on or more of the wives of the sons of Noah. It is said that the generations of Noah were pure, not that the generations of his wife or daughter-in-laws. It is possible that the genetic information was passed down from the Nephilim to their children, including any daughters they had. The Bible does leave this open for some debate. Since the followers of Satan are fallen Angels, they would be able to live in the spiritual realm, separate from Earth and safe from the Flood. If so and they could have children with mortal women, they could simply repeat their pre-flood rebellion. I have not read the old testament apocrypha but I understand there may be an explanation there. Jesus does say that as it was in the days of Noah so it shall be in the last days. Let me see, man is doing what is right in their own eyes, calling good evil and evil good. We have many people seeking power, for the sake of power. We teach that there is no God. So, it seems that we cannot be far from the days of Noah. That should give one cause for thought. ",
