            "answer_text": "Yes under various guises..the US is an imperial power and still Americans deny it. the face and guise has changed but the facts remain. The United States appear to be destined by Providence to plague America with misery in the name of liberty. Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar A state too expensive in itself, or by virtue of its dependencies, ultimately falls into decay; its free government is transformed into a tyranny; it disregards the principles which it should preserve, and finally degenerates into despotism. The distinguishing characteristic of small republics is stability: the character of large republics is mutability. Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar History teaches us that the capacity of things to get worse is limitless. Roman history suggests that the short, happy life of the American republic may be coming to its end... the US will probably maintain a facade of constitutional government and drift along until financial bankruptcy overtakes it. Chalmers Johnson Imperial politics represents the conquest of domestic politics and the latter's conversion into a crucial element of inverted totalitarianism. It makes no sense to ask how the democratic citizen could 'participate' substantively in imperial politics; hence it is not surprising that the subject of empire is taboo in electoral debates. No major politician or party has so much as publicly remarked on the existence of an American empire. Chalmers Johnson \u201cI spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.\u201d \u2015 Smedley D.

            "answer_text": "Well, yes and no\u2026. There are various types of Imperialism. I like to split Imperialism into two categories. Direct Imperialism - When a strong nation takes over a weaker nation by use of military force. Then, once the weaker nation is occupied, it will become a territory, colony or satrapy of the stronger nation. (Yes, I'm aware of the possibility of the nation entering the dominator's sphere of influence, but that's where it gets fuzzy. I'll touch on it later.)Indirect Imperialism - This is usually done by economic domination. (e.g. trade, foreign investment etc\u2026) In this form of Imperialism, the weaker nation is, economically, at the mercy of the stronger one. This could mean anything from control over the weaker nation's currency to regulations on the country's trade from within. One important, although obvious, thing about this type of Imperialism is that this automatically places the weaker nation in the stronger one's sphere of influence. No more, no less. (Like I said, \u201cIt gets fuzzy.\u201d)Aside from the two types, there is the idea of the sphere of influence. The sphere of influence can be achieved by either military, or economic, domination. It is also the only state of Imperialism which can be achieved by either method. Anything more, and military power is required. Anything less, and, well\u2026 there's no control at all. As far as today's Imperialism goes, sphere of influence is about as far as it gets. It's either that, or, \u201cno control.\u201d That being said, economic domination is certainly used far more than military domination these days. However, there are exceptions\u2026 United States *cough* *cough* Anyway, that's enough blabbing about for me, I do hope I answered to your satisfaction. Cheers!!!!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "\u2018Imperialism\u2019 has several different meanings: Traditional Imperialism consisted of the conquest of several areas and peoples and their rule by a ruler from another area. The purpose of the conquests was to get money and power for the ruler and his cronies. This was the only form of Empire until after 1700 - it continued after that, notably in the forms of the Ottoman, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese and (short-lived) Japanese Empires - but after 1700 other forms of Imperialism started. There was also \u2018colonialism\u2019, a state that sent of groups of people to settle in a new area. This was practiced by the classical Greeks in the period 600\u2013400BCE and probably earlier as well by the \u2018sea people\u2019 around 1200BCE as well as by the Spanish, British, French and Dutch after around 1600. This is different in that the areas to be colonised are presumed to be largely uninhabited and the objectives is to set up self-sustaining farming communities. The term \u2018colonial\u2019 is often misused for later forms of \u2018imperialism\u2019. After several European countries set up chains of trading posts. Initially this was only Venice and Genoa in the Mediterranean but after 1600 and the age of European sail it expanded and major new chains of trading posts were set up in Africa and Asia by- Portugal, the Netherlands, Russia (across Siberia) and Britain. The European wars of the 18th century started to spill into the colonies in America and the trading post network, notably in India, where local rulers took one side or another to attack European Trading posts. As a result, some local kingdoms fell under European control (notably Bengal). From the start of the 19th century, European Nations started to grab what land they could in competition with each other to build up largely token Empires - in many areas, supposed European rule had very little impact on the ground. These we can call Nationalist Empires, the most famous of which was the Indian Empire under British rule. By 1945, these \u2018Empires\u2019 were observed to be pointless as far as the \u2018mother country\u2019 was concerned - they contributed very little and often had a cost. Moreover, several areas had developed Nationalism - the idea that peoples are split into different types (called Nations) and these types should each rule a bit of land exclusively (Nation-States) and were keen for independence. Plus people were fed up with being patronised by Europeans. So, in the period 1945 - 1970 almost all parts of the Nationalist Empires were made independent. The position is complicated by Marx, who theorised that the Empires were needed to absorb the excess production of the European powers (an odd form of exploitation), so imperialism was part of the Bourgeois exploitation of the masses and needed to be fought. hence the demonisation of \u2018Imperialism\u2019 As you comment, since the withdrawal of \u2018Imperial rule\u2019 in many areas little has changed. Canada seems much the same after the official abandonment of Imperial connections as it did before and so does India, Hong Kong, Ghana and so on. This it seems is not the continuation of Imperialism by other means but simply the fact that most Nationalist Imperialism didn\u2019t amount to a hill of beans. Ghana became \u2018under British and then independent\u2019 within one lifetime (that of Winston Churchill). It never had more then 1 person in 200 British, even in the towns (census of 1901) and local rule continued under the local rulers throughout. Some Imperial rules in some areas had more impact but, even in India, it was minimal and the changes in India since independence in 1947 are minimal. Some like to see Imperialism as the cause of their country\u2019s poverty but can only do so with much special pleading: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore are all richer per head then their former \u2018Imperial Master\u2019, Britain, and others, such as Malaysia and Malta have very similar wealth per head. Places like India, Indonesia and most of Africa have not got wealthier after, now 60+, years of independence. ",

However, I would say it is imposed by the First and Second World countries like China and not the Third World countries like India. \u201cThe rules of globalization were written by the West and the Empire. We have only played by it.\u201d Here, \u2018We\u2019 refers to the developing third world countries like India. Whether nations like India get to enter Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) or not is decided by a second world country like China. Whether a country like India or Japan gets to enter the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is decided only by these first and second world countries. When there is no consultation happening with emerging powers, how is it possible for the latter to exercise political control or economic exploitation across the world? Thus, it is not the third world nations like India that are commanding political control over superpowers. Instead, it is the other way around.  On one hand, the developed nations, having a greater say at World Trade Organization (WTO), are expecting the developing nations to abolish the Anti Dumping Duties on cheap goods exported by different countries. On the other hand, the developed nations do not want cheap labours in their countries and are resorting to protectionism. You now know who is trying to exploit the economy. ",

Perhaps the most recent signs of imperialism have been demonstrated by the PRC. It\u2019s \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative is nothing more than the exercise of economic imperialism. Loaning money and financing massive projects in small countries who are clearly unable to repay those loans is economic imperialism.

Cultural Imperialism is even harder to define as there must be a distinction made between voluntary and involuntary cultural imperialism. Many claim that western cultural values continue to pervade their own national identity but this is not forced and not a deliberate attempt but if combined with economic domination then the case takes on a different perspective. So yes, imperialism still exists but in a more subtle form. ",
