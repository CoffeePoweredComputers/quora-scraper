            "answer_text": "The origin of the term \u201cCold War\u201d has been credited to Bernard Baruch, a politician and financier, who used it in a speech he gave in 1947. It was meant to encompass a state of existence between two nations or groups of nations that are at odds in virtually every way - ideology, economy, culture, basic freedoms, and so forth. The Cold War was considered cold because the United States and the Soviet Union never actually went directly to war with one another. They came frightfully close on several occasions, including the Berlin Crisis of 1947\u201348, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, and a couple of sketchy moments during the Korean and Vietnam conflicts. Thankfully cooler heads prevailed (pun intended), and the cold war never got hot. Instead, the U.S. and the Soviets chose a number of other nations to fight their wars for them. These proxy wars were certainly hot wars, and they generally took place in countries in which the Soviets were looking to subvert the local government in favor of a communist satellite that would do Moscow\u2019s bidding. America got directly involved in some big proxy wars, including, of course, Korea and Vietnam. Between the two conflicts, roughly 100,000 Americans lost their lives to maintain the status quo (Korea) or lose to a more dedicated force willing to continue the fight until Judgment Day (Vietnam). America also got involved in a clandestine manner in several places - Iran, Chile, Nicaragua and other places where CIA-sponsored indigenous groups fought against Soviet-backed forces to keep the communists from coming to power or overthrowing communist-friendly governments. The Soviet Union also got directly involved in a lot of proxy fights - Afghanistan, Angola, and dozens of other third world locales where they would send troops, KGB agents, money, and guns. Both America and the Soviets spent trillions of dollars on military expenditures over the course of the 50 years they remained at odds with one another. In the never ending quest for military superiority, they invested in more and better weapons. In the end it came down to economics and technology, two areas in which the Soviets simply couldn\u2019t match the U.S. The Cold War ended without things getting hot between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. To say it ended peacefully may be an overstatement, depending on your point of view. Sure, it ended peacefully between America and Soviet Russia. But for a number of other nations, the Cold War did not end peacefully. Many lives were forever altered, or ended altogether, in lands most people had never heard of until we started sending troops there. So, yeah, I guess you could say that the Cold War was an actual war. ",

            "answer_text": "Was the \u201cCold War\u201d actually a war? It was a period of psychological warfare in which the USSR on one side and the western allies on the other, postured and called each other names. It was a time of disinformation by both sides. Working in a major telecommunications centre, I once had the job of transmitting some documents for the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires of the Czechoslovakian embassy (then a USSR satellite). Clearly he didn\u2019t want those documents to go through his embassy\u2019s comms room. One of our staff members asked him, \u201cWhat sort of lies do you tell your people about us?\u201d And his relaxed reply was, \u201cPretty much what your government tells you about us.\u201d And so it was. Perhaps the closest the Cold War came to going hot was the Cuban Missile Crisis. It was brinkmanship at a dangerous level. These days we\u2019re seeing a mini-version\u2014a reprise\u2014of the Cold War being played out on two levels. Kim Jong-un is only a cardboard replica of Nikita Kruschev while Donald Trump in no way compares to JKF. He and his family are doing a pretty fine imitation of Larry, Curly and Mo. Unless either Kim or Trump lets his emotions get the better of him and launches a rocket it will remain childish bluster. I don\u2019t think Kim is likely to do more than threaten but I wouldn\u2019t bet against the Wanker in the White House. The other parallel today is in the misinformation game and the conspiracy employed to influence the 2016 presidential election. The image below certainly had an impact on many Bible-loving Republicans. Had the Internet existed during the Cold War, who knows what aberrations may have been seen. Even so, I can\u2019t imagine Kennedy and Krushchev indulging their inner child on Twitter.  (Image courtesy Vladimir Putin and the Trump team.) ",
