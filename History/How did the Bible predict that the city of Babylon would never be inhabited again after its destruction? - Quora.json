            "answer_text": "100 years before Babylon reached the height of its power, Isaiah the prophet foretold its overthrow in very specific terms. In a chapter headed \"The burden of Babylon\", this is what he said: \". . . The day of the Lord is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty . . . Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them . . . And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans' pride, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. It shall never be inhabited . . . neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall shepherds make their flocks to lie down there. But wild beasts of the deserts shalt lie there\" (Isaiah 13:6,17,19- 21). The fate of Babylon is clear: the attackers are to be the Medes (a nation to the east of Babylon); the city is to become a desolation, inhabited by neither man nor beast. And let us remind ourselves that this clear prophecy was uttered 100 years before Babylon arose to the height of its power and glory. Another prophet, Jeremiah, writing 100 years later, when Nebuchadnezzar was about to attack Jerusalem, added to the forecasts of Babylon's downfall: \"Behold, I will raise up against Babylon a destroying wind . . . Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed . . . Prepare against (Babylon) the nations, with the kings of the Medes . . . Babylon shall become heaps (ruins), a dwellingplace for jackals, an astonishment and an hissing, without inhabitant . . . The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates shall be burned with fire . . . 0 Lord, thou hast spoken against this place to cut it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor beast, but it shall be desolate for ever . . .\" And finally the prophet is commanded to bind a stone to the roll of the prophecy and to throw it into the river Euphrates, declaring, \"Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again . . . \" (Jeremiah 51:1,8,28,37,58,62-64). The agreement between the prophecies of Isaiah, written 100 years before Babylon arose to power, and of Jeremiah, written when the empire and city were at the height of their glory; is complete. To the people of those days it must have sounded as it would to us if it were prophesied that a great city like London, New York or Sydney was to be destroyed and to remain a desolation for ever. In this age of nuclear weapons such a fate would not be inconceivable; but the prophets of Israel uttered their predictions over 2500 years ago, long before anyone dreamed that such total destruction was possible. History reveals how the prophecies about the fate of Babylon were progressively fulfilled. The first despoilers were the Medes and the Persians in the 6th century B.C. From that time the glory of Babylon began to fade. Then came the Greeks under Alexander the Great, then the Romans; after them various warlike tribes like the Parthians, the Arabs and the Tartars. For centuries the actual site of the ancient city of Babylon was a heap of ruins, shunned--so travelers tell us--by wandering nomads. It was not until the archaeologists began to explore the site in the first half of the 19th century that the ruins of the great walls, the mighty temples and gates, and the immense statues revealed to an astonished world how magnificent ancient Babylon must have appeared in its day. So history reveals how Babylon, \"the glory of kingdoms\", became ruined and deserted, just as the prophets of Israel said it would. Bible Truth And Prophecy ",

            "answer_text": "Two great prophets, Daniel and Isaiah, warned of the death of Babylon. We must not get confused with the Great Babylon of Revelation, which has more to do with the construction of all the false religions which began there, and the catholic church and the world\u2019s evil trade system than physical Babylon. Under Nebuchadnezzar (spellings vary) Babylon had conquered most of the known world, with extreme cruelty. She appeared to be invulnerable, protected by the river Euphrates, and the legend was that she would never fall until the river turned against her. In 550 B.C. Cyrus rebelled, the army supported him, and He came to power as the king of the Medes and Persians. Three years later, after putting down an Assyrian rebellion he became undisputed master, and 2 years later he was ready to expand. His attack method against Babylon was unprecedented. His armies sneaked in with the intention of besieging the city, only to find that the Euphrates had turned traitor. It had undermined the walls of Babylon, and they had fallen into the river and changed its course. The Medo Persian forces were able to wade across and take possession without a fight . However, the prophecies stated that after its fall no one would inhabit it. The city carried on for some time, but after a revolt against Xerxes in 482 B.C, much ot the city was destroyed. The fertile land which kept the city supplied with food had been maintained by a massive system of canals and dykes, but there were too few people to maintain them, and they went back to being marshland. Alexander the Greek arrived and tried to restore the temples, but failed. However he later returned with grandiose plans to restore the city, but died shortly thereafter.. By the time Trajan turned up around 115 A.D. the place was deserted. He planned to restore a temple to sacrifice to Alexander, but his health failed, and he returned to Italy where shortly thereafter he died. In 1985, Saddam Hussein, fancying himself as the new Nebuchadnezzar, began to restore Babylon, but the little he achieved was destroyed during the war. There are still intentions to restore it, but given the ill fated efforts in the past, anyone interested in longevity would be well advised to stay away. ",

Notice this Babylon rides the back of the Beast with seven heads and ten horns which will eventually destroy Babylon the Great and take over the world systems and cause everyone who\u2019s name is not written in the Lambs book of life to receive a mark (666) Revelations chapter 13. The Beast destroys Babylon the Great in Rev. chapter 17:17. As you should have noticed we have covered qiute a few chapters in the book of Revelations in fact this one subject covers the majority of chapters in the book. The identity of Babylon the Great is understood by the fact that it is the greatest nation on earth and that it rides and controls the beast with seven heads and ten horn in the last days which is now (2019) .

            "answer_text": "How did the Bible predict that the city of Babylon would never be inhabited again after its destruction? The history of Babylon was told in the bible hundreds of years before it happened, which is what Isaiah 13:17-22 and Jeremiah 50:39 is all about. Isaiah and Jeremiah predicted that the Medes (who in their day was as weak as water) would ultimately overcome Babylon, which is exactly what happened. The Medes and Persians became a dominant power and captured the city without a battle, and, according to Daniel 5:31, Darius the Mede was put in charge. A Prophecy About Babylon Confirms the Accuracy of the Bible The thing about bible prophecy is that is often like the different stages in a telescope as it peers far into the future. There are different stages of development of the prophecy until its fulfillment in some future time (sometimes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 stages). ",

Isaiah was way off and the descrition he made of the destruction never happened. If he was describing what it is today, then it took over a thousand years to come true, because it was inhabited until after the 7th century CE. Just a few miles away is a large inhabited city with a population of 50,000. The reason for it\u2019s decline was because the Greeks, Seleucid empire, built a new capital, Seleucia in about 270 BCE, and moved most of the population to it. From then on it\u2019s fate was set.
