This set me on the path to asking how a building could be the tallest in the world from 4,500 years and 166 years later not even be in the top 10,000 tallest buildings. The result of exploring this sudden change is my new book 'The Birth of Now' http://ww.amazon.co.uk/The-Birth-Now-Greatest-History/dp/1785891227?ie=UTF8&keywords=The%20Birth%20of%20Now&qid=1460363103&ref_=sr_1_3&s=books&sr=1-3 ",

            "answer_text": "I would put Florence Cathedral dome by Fillipo Brunneleschi at the top of the list. It was built in the early 1400s but marked an important point in architecture (moving from antiquity into modernity) in that it was structurally self supporting as it was built. Prior to that time, large domes and vaults required support scaffolding until complete. ",
