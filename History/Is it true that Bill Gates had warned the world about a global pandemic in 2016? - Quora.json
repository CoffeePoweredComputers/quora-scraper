            "answer_text": "The evolution of virus is instant and many virologists have seen mutations to be more successful virus. For many years the scientists have said it is only time before another Spanish flu happens. Only a few suggested that the next pandemic would be caused by a CHinese military deadly virus lab or that any nation would intentionally try to destroy other nations with SWINE FLU, SARS, MERS, and then Covid-19. President GW Bush saw it and pleaded for Obama-Biden to accelerate virus research and science to be prepared for future releases after SARS. But Obama-Biden ignored the warnings and facts and cut budgets in many sciences including virus, then they stoped research and vaccine trials tests on SARS. If we hadaSARS virus it\u2019s technology and vaccine would be helpful today. Very short sighted decisions that greatly affect us today. ",
