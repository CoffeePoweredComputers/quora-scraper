            "answer_text": "Jan Hus (c. 1369\u20131415) attacked the Church by denouncing the moral failings of clergy, bishops, and even the papacy from his pulpit. He spoke out against the sale of Indulgences as Martin Luther would do later. Jan Hus was willing to accept a promise of safe passage, which was his downfall. No doubt, the Church was sincere in its efforts to get Hus to recant, if only because this would present the Church as the innocent party, but he felt obliged to deny those things he had not taught and stand firm on those things he had taught. Martin Luther (1483\u20131546) was promised a safe-conduct to stand trial in Rome, but refused because of what had happened to Jan Hus, who after accepting safe-conduct was burnt at the stake. In 1st January 1521, Leo's excommunication of Martin Luther took effect. Leo called on the Holy Roman Emperor to enforce his bull of excommunication, but Luther had the protection of powerful princes. His writing ability and the recent invention of the movable type printing press ensured Luther wide publicity and the protection that goes with such publicity. ",
