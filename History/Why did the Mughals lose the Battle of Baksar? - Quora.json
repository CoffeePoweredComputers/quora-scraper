            "answer_text": "Battle of Buxar, Buxur also spelled Baksar 1764 conflict at Buxar in northeastern India between the forces of the British east india company, commanded by Major Hector Munro, and the combined army of an alliance of Indian states including bengal, Awadh, and the mughal empire. This decisive battle confirmed British power over Bengal and bihar after their initial success at the battle of Plasseyin in 1757 and marked the end of the attempt to rule Bengal through a nawab.Thenceforth the company took control. The British victory at Buxar resulted in a large area of the Indian subcontinent coming under British control. After consolidating gains made at the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the British East India Company assembled an army consisting mainly of Indian sepoys and Indian cavalry and sought to assert its control of Bengal against the Mughal Empire. In October 1764, the combined Indian force confronted the British near the town of Buxar. The British, under the command of Sir Hector Munro, were divided into three sections. On the left flank, Major Stibbert commanded regular troops; on the right were the Bengalese troops, commanded by Major Champion. Supporting these in the center were the Bengal cavalry backed by four companies of sepoys. Champion advanced first and attacked a small village close to the town. After a series of bloody encounters the Indian forces were pushed back, allowing Champion to occupy the village. Meanwhile, the main Indian force advanced to engage Stibbert\u2019s regular troops. However, having secured the village on the Indian left flank, Champion was able move out and outflank the Indian advance. Despite their superiority in numbers, the Indians were encircled and took heavy casualties from British musketvolleys. The battle resulted in the 1765 Treaty of allahbad in which the Mughal Emperor surrendered in Bengal to the British. Lord robert clive, the victor at the Plassey, became the first governor of Bengal.According to other sources the combined army of the Mughals, Awadh and mir qasim consisting of 40,000 men was defeated by a British army comprising 10,000 men. The lack of basic co-ordination among the three disparate allies was responsible for their decisive defeat. ",
