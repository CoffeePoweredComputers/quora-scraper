            "answer_text": "I love Ayn Rand (author) and her books, and while I may not agree with her 100%, I do agree with her definition of Individualism:   Individualism regards man\u2014every man\u2014as an independent, sovereign entity who possesses an inalienable right to his own life, a right derived from his nature as a rational being. Individualism holds that a civilized society, or any form of association, cooperation or peaceful coexistence among men, can be achieved only on the basis of the recognition of individual rights\u2014and that a group, as such, has no rights other than the individual rights of its members. However, this does not mean Selfishness, as the site goes on to say:   Do not make the mistake of the ignorant who think that an individualist is a man who says: \u201cI\u2019ll do as I please at everybody else\u2019s expense.\u201d An individualist is a man who recognizes the inalienable individual rights of man\u2014his own and those of others. An individualist is a man who says: \u201cI will not run anyone\u2019s life\u2014nor let anyone run mine. I will not rule nor be ruled. I will not be a master nor a slave. I will not sacrifice myself to anyone\u2014nor sacrifice anyone to myself.\u201d I prefer to think of it as being truely respectful of others feelings/thoughts/actions/motivations and expecting others to be the same.

            "answer_text": "A quick Google search defines individualism as the \u201chabit or principle of being independent and self-reliant or a social theory favoring freedom of action for individuals over a collective or state control.\u201d The question seems to put forward the idea that such a philosophy is a bad thing or detrimental to society, but does not venture any reasons for this position. Lacking any reasons or any attempt to justify such a position; one can only conclude that the question deserves to be in the trolling section or in that section limited only to choir members. Absent individualism or individual freedom, one is defined by a collective, as too, talents, ambitions, words and thought. Such political philosophy is better found in those failed system of government better identified as Nazi Germany, the USSR or even, currently, Venezuela as the people now fight and riot for the basic necessities of life. Where does the practice of individualism end? It ends in a free and open society where the people are free to achieve based upon their own abilities and where such achievement results in innovation, invention, competition that brings humanity up from the confines of a totalitarian rule, This is also called capitalism; a philosophy of government that protects those inherent rights of the individual to be free.
