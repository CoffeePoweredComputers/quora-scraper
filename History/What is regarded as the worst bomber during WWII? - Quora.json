            "answer_text": "My choice goes to the Reichsfackel, Heinkel 177 Greif.  The sad story of Greif (Griffin) is full of overengineering, executive meddling, mismanagement, poor worksmanship and simply poor design. It was designed to be a jack of all trades and it really was a master of none. In 1936, the company of Heinkel Flugzeugwerke received details of the new Bomber A specification from the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM). This specification, first proposed by the RLM on 3 June 1936. The Bomber A aircraft specification required the plane to carry a bomb-load of at least 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) over a range of 5,000 km (3,100 mi), with a maximum speed of not less than 500 km/h (311 mph) at altitude. This was a formidable specification, calling as it did for an aircraft able to outrun any modern fighter \u2013 as was expected with the top speeds of the main force Schnellbomber concept \u2013 and outperform, by a considerable margin, any bomber then in service. On 2 June 1937, Heinkel Flugzeugwerke received instructions to proceed with construction of a full-scale mock-up of its Projekt 1041 Bomber A. That was completed in November 1937, and on 5 November 1937 it was allocated the official RLM airframe type number \"8-177\", the same day that the Luftwaffe High Command (OKL) stipulated that the new design should possess sufficient structural strength to enable it to undertake medium-degree diving attacks. Heinkel Flugzeugwerke's estimated performance figures for Projekt 1041 included a top speed of 550 km/h (342 mph) at 5,500 m (18,050 ft) and a loaded weight of 27,000 kg (59,500 lb). In order to achieve these estimates, Heinkel's chief designer, Siegfried G\u00fcnter, employed several revolutionary features. Enter Ernst Udet. He insisted this plane should be able to carry out dive bombing - yes, you read it right: a heavy bomber being able to do dive bombing so that none of its bomb load would be wasted. The inaccuracy of horizontal bombing demonstrated weaknesses in German bombsights and created doubts about the effectiveness of the method. Some in the Luftwaffe believed that dive-bombing was a more effective way to destroy targets. Technical data supported the accuracy of Stuka bombing achieving greater target destruction over Dornier Do 17 or Heinkel He 111. The experience of the Condor Legion in Spain tended to support the idea that dive bombing was superior and led some to believe that pinpoint accuracy was possible, which diverted attention from improving horizontal bombing. Okay, they quit the idea of a conventional four-engine bomber and instead insist the plane should have two engines like Junkers Ju 88. The He 177 required at least a pair of 2,000 hp engines to meet performance requirements. No engine in the German aviation power-plant industry at that time developed such power. A four-engine version would have been possible with engines like the Daimler-Benz DB 601 but the four-engine layout would involve higher propeller drag for dive bombing. So Daimler-Benz comes with a brilliant idea: let\u2019s hitch two of these DB601 engines together operating a single driveshaft! The result was the Daimler-Benz DB 606 \"power system\" setup. It consisted of a pair of DB 601 liquid-cooled 12-cylinder inverted-vee inline engines - making up a \u2018w\u2019 engine. Yes, the cylinder banks viewed from behind formed a \u2018w\u2019. On 9 November 1939, the first prototype, the He 177 V1, was flown for the first time. The flight terminated abruptly after only 12 minutes due to overheating engines. Pilot Francke was pleased with the general handling and landing characteristics of the prototype but complained of some vibration in the airscrew shafts, the inadequacy of the tail surfaces under certain conditions, and some flutter which accompanied any vigorous movement of the elevators. Back to the old drawing board and redesigning the empennage. 20% increase on tailplane surface - and weight to rear, making the plane horribly unstable. Two years are wasted on re-design. The He 177 V5 incorporated a number of changes which were principally concerned with defensive armament installations. Early in 1941, during a simulated low-level attack, both DB 606 engines burst into flames, and the V5 hit the ground and exploded. It appeared the engines were over-stressed and the contraption would not be take off on full bomb load and fully armed. In September 1941, the He 177 V8 was made available for engine tests. However, owing to the urgency of other development work it was returned to Heinkel after only 40 days, and it was not possible to resume engine tests in the air until February 1942. Enter Hermann G\u00f6ring. He is not amused. By early August 1942 he became angry about the apparent slowness with which the He 177A's powerplant problems were being dealt with. On August 13 he responded about the He 177A's powerplant troubles, particularly containing remarks about the problems caused by the compromised design of the DB 606 powerplants' accommodation in the He 177A's engine nacelles, and resultant poor maintenance access: \"Why has this silly engine suddenly turned up, which is so idiotically welded together? They told me then, there would be two engines connected behind each other, and suddenly there appears this misbegotten monster of welded-together engines one cannot get at! Turns out G\u00f6ring was right: DB606 was a rotten egg. Starting with the He 177 A-3/R2, a modified engine nacelle with a new \"power system\", the Daimler-Benz DB 610, each of which consisted of a pair of Daimler-Benz DB 605s set up to work as one as the DB 606 had been, was used to eliminate the tendency for engine fires. The ridiculous dive-bombing capability requirement is cancelled in September 1942. In addition to carrying a variety of bombs, torpedoes, and guided weapons, the He 177 was tested with a number of unorthodox offensive armaments. The first of the experimental weapons fitments known to have been tested was the 12 examples of the He 177 A-1/U2 Zerst\u00f6rer variant, which was armed with a pair of limited-traverse 30 mm MK 101 cannons in the extreme front of a dramatically enlarged Bola ventral gondola (beyond the hemispherical \"fishbowl\" nose glazing), and intended for ground attack, train busting, and long-range anti-ship raids. The plane was finally declared battle-ready in December 1942, when it first was used to support German troops in Stalingrad. The cold Russian winter hid neatly the chronic problem of \u2018w\u2019 engines - inadequate cooling. Greifs began to seep to long-range bomber units one by one. The old nemesis of DB606 - overheating and engine fires - return with DB610. The plane quickly earned nicknames Reichsfackel (State Torch), Reichsfeuerzeug (State Cigarette Lighter) and Luftwaffenz\u00fcnder (Air Force Detonator). He 177 quickly became unpopular amongst the German crews. As the war progressed, He 177 operations became increasingly desultory. Fuel and personnel shortages presented difficulties, and He 177s were sitting on airfields all over Europe awaiting new engines or engine related modifications. Of the fourteen He 177A-3s that were sent out during Operation Steinbock, one suffered a burst tyre, and eight returned with overheating or burning engines. Of the four that reached London, one was lost to night fighters. These aircraft were brand new, delivered a week before the operation and not fully flown in, because the air unit had moved to a new airfield the day before and lacked sufficient maintenance personnel and material. Constant attacks against Luftwaffe long-range combat units in France made continuous operations difficult. During operations on the Eastern Front in early 1944, often carried out in daylight at about 6,000 m or higher, losses were relatively light. The Soviet Air Force, equipped mainly for low-level interception and ground-attack roles, could do little to hinder the high-flying bombers. Unfortunately the bombing accuracy was bad. In the Western front, the plane was mostly used as maritime bomber in anti-shipping roles, yet in common with most piston-engined German bombers, most He 177s were grounded from the summer of 1944 as Allied bombing offensive destroyed the synthetic fuel plants, fighters having the privilege for the last drops of aviation fuel. The adoption of the Emergency Fighter Program in early July 1944 dealt the final blow to the entire He 177B development program, with the Heinkel He 162 jet fighter being the only new Heinkel aircraft design allowed into production. Captain Eric Brown flew the He 177 post-war. He wrote that the in-flight handling characteristics of the He 177 A-5 were \"... positive about all axes, but the controls were all remarkably light for such a large aircraft. Indeed I had the feeling that the elevator was dangerously light and I was all too aware of the intelligence reports of He 177s breaking up in the air so I decided to treat this control very gently... The aircraft had an automatic pull-out device and an acceleration warning apparatus fitted, but it really was nailbiting to have to treat a giant like this immense Heinkel bomber as if it was made of glass. The stalling characteristics with flaps and undercarriage lowered, the aircraft buffeted violently at 140 km/h before the nose dropped at 135 km/h. The buffet experienced was so violent that I had some concerns over structural damage. Somehow the He 177 always conveyed an impression of fragility despite its size.\" He added that it was \"one of the very few German aircraft of the period that I tested that I did not enjoy flying\".

            "answer_text": "It depends on which features one wants to compare, but my vote would be the B-24 Liberator.  (Consolidated B-24 Liberator) The B-24 was designed to have greater range and a larger bomb load than the previously deployed B-17, and it did. It was also faster that the B-17 and had a shorter turn radius. It was designed in ways that made it possible to build large numbers more quickly than other bombers. For these reasons (primarily long range, large bomb capacity, and ease of construction) it was used in every theater during World War II. However: In order to reduce weight, it had little armor to protect the crew and fewer defensive guns than the B-17.Had several fuel tanks that, when first deployed, were not self sealing. The fuel system was also prone to leaks. These caused many to burst into flames when taking relatively light damage. Had notoriously weak internal structure supporting the wings, which is why there are so many photos of B-24s falling out of the sky with their wings folded up like a butterfly. Initial versions had only one escape hatch, and that was near the tail. More hatches were added later, but were very difficult to get to. This feature was the main reason that crews dubbed the B-24 \u201cThe Flying Coffin\u201d.Was a miserable airplane to fly, especially in terms of yaw control. The twin vertical stabilizers helped a little, but maintaining control still required almost constant rudder command by the pilot, which was exhausting on long missions.Its may design flaws made numerous and frequent engineering changes necessary throughout its service history. There were four different different service manuals in use at the same time and numerous differences in parts throughout the B-24\u2019s service life. This made maintenance in the field very difficult and complicated.Produced in large numbers, the B-24 was a real work horse, and its crews completed many significant missions throughout the war. But it was a lousy airplane, and was dropped from the inventories of the countries that used it very soon after the end of World War II. The U.S. stopped production three weeks after the German surrender, which was about six weeks before the Japanese surrender. Those who had flown the B-24 were glad to see it gone. By 1945, production had shifted to the B-29. ",
