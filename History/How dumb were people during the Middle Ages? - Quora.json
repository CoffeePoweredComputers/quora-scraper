            "answer_text": "Not at all. They were basically the same as us. Of course, if they had been subjected to severe famines or serious disease in childhood, their intellectual development might have been impaired, but that would hardly register if you met them. What you would notice was that they were, by our standards, phenomenally uneducated. Their world operated on superstition and religion, and they would have almost no knowledge of anything they could not observe themselves, or that was further away than maybe a day\u2019s walking. But when it came to such things as sowing their fields, repairing agricultural machinery using only a wooden hammer and a piece of string, observing the weather or taking care of their livestock, it would be you who came across as ignorant. In fact, you\u2019d hardly be able to survive for sheer ignorance. Maybe you know how electricity works, but you can probably not do the wiring of an entire house, construct a generator, or manufacture any useful electrical gadgets, using only aforementioned wooden hammer and piece of string. Maybe you know about penicillin, but you could probably not identify the exact species of mould you need to cultivate, nor what to do with it once you\u2019ve found it. Very nearly everything you know was useless in the Middle Ages. ",

            "answer_text": "The dumb people were as dumb as a Trump supporter; the smart people were smarter than you and me. They didn't know a lot of stuff that we know, of course, and they started from different assumptions; the writing that comes to us from the West all assumes the truth of Christianity, but there's plenty of intellectual space within that position, and there was probably more space within Islam, at least early on. Christian thinkers knew and coped with the thought of pagans, Moslems, and Jews. In the country, they knew how to grow stuff, and you have to be smart to do that well. They could work out optimal property acquisition strategies, and they could represent themselves in local courts. So, on average, not dumb at all. Since 2k years is not much in evolutionary time, why should it have been different? ",
