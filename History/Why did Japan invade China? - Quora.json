            "answer_text": "Japan invaded China because Japan\u2019s economy needed a lot of resources that didn\u2019t have. They also struggled to trade for them. Japanese imperialism led Japan to desire to expand, and centuries-old anti-Western feelings led Japan to desire to create a new European-free Asia led by Japan instead of the Western Powers. This Asian Asia came to be referred to the \u201cGreater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\u201d. In order to create a sphere that spanned Asia, as the Japanese desired, Japan had three areas to expand to first: China, Russia, or the European colonies. Japan\u2019s first goals were resources. Soviet East Asia had few resources, most notably lacking oil, the most needed resource. The Soviets also possessed a very powerful military, and this is why an invasion of Russia was practically out of the question (though there were many supporters of an invasion of Russia, knowing their status as an international outcast, ostracized by their Communist tendencies. This ostracism meant that nobody would help the Soviets, and even fewer people would care). That left China and the European colonies. Between the two, China was far more promising because China, while it had a massive military, suffered from a large civil war and many warlords taking advantage of the situation to form de facto independent territories. The European colonies, however, were lightly defended, and Japanese military might could have defeated the Dutch armies altogether and kicked the British and French out of Asia fairly quickly, though likely only temporarily, and any war with a colonial power would have dragged on for a long time as the European powers\u2019 homelands were all in Europe, and a naval invasion rom such a distance would have not been feasible. Both China and the European colonies had many vital resources that Japan needed. However, given the split status of China and the amount of threat that Japan would face in invading European colonies, Japan decided to attack China, even though China had a large military. China was not nearly as threatening as you probably think it was. Chinese command had immense difficulty maintaining control over its own lands, and the civil war China was fighting meant that its armies were exhausted and ill-prepared for war on a new front. China\u2019s military was also ill-equipped, lacked air power or armor divisions, and had to import any artillery it used from foreign countries like the US because it wasn\u2019t industrialized and had almost no factories, much less ones capable of producing artillery. This, coupled with Japanese air, naval, and technological advantages, led Japan to invade China, and withhold military campaigns in the rest of Asia until it had stabilized its industrial base and obtained greater resources with which to fuel a war effort on a greater scale.

            "answer_text": "Japan actually invaded China before the war began elsewhere, in 1937, and the reasons for doing so are quite obvious. Japan is an island nation, and although the land of cherry blossoms is beautiful it is scarce in natural resources. Japan had for years been pursuing an expansionist policy to secure resources and create an empire. They had been steadily expanding in Manchuria since 1931 and had been fighting border wars against the Soviet Union. In 1937 they staged a false-flag operation - the Marco Polo Bride Incident - as a casus belli and invaded. The reasons for doing so were mostly the same reasons any empire invades others. Land, resources, population, prestige, sheer power - Japan needed or wanted it all. China was, and is, a colossus, a vast country of 500 million people. There are raw minerals to motorise the army, fuels to power Japan\u2019s navy and air force, rice to feed Japan\u2019s population. China was still in what would later be called the \u2018century of humiliation\u2019 - divided, at war with itself, enduring famine and floods. Not unlike the military planners at Hitler\u2019s OKW in Europe did with the Soviet Union, Japan severely underestimated the Chinese will and ability to fight. But mixed in with the typical reasons for invading were some uniquely Japanese reasons for invading. Following Japan\u2019s victory in the First World War, there had been a massive movement for democracy in Japan, particularly among students. Japanese textile merchants were struggling to compete with Chinese exports, and the Great Depression reduced Japanese exports and profits even more. At the same time, there was a great revival in Japanese traditions and culture. After the Russo-Japanese War, the First World War and the wars against the USSR, all victories against European powers, it was clear to most Japanese that their traditions and spirit, mixed with European technology, was superior to both European and Asian opponents. At the same time, General Tojo and his military colleagues inspired a fascistic mix of militarism and violent nationalism, centred around ancient traditions and a veneration of the Emperor. Just as in Germany and Italy, a centrepiece of this doctrine was the need to aggressively expand. The invasion of China was actually in part a compromise between the two opposing doctrines in the Japanese military at the time. Hokushin-ron, \u2018northern expansion\u2019 plan, was favoured by the army. It was an invasion of Siberia, Mongolia and Manchuria against the Soviet Union. Nanshin-ron was the \u2018southern expansion\u2019 doctrine favoured by the navy, involving the invasion of Dutch Indonesia and Singapore, Burma and Indochina. This doctrine was the one eventually adopted in 1941, and it was when Japan was persuaded that the USA would be drawn in that they planned desperate, doomed gamble of Peal Harbour. The only thing the two branches could agree on was an invasion of China. This was a very foolish thing to do. The Japanese were arrogant, in some ways just as imperialist as the western powers, and they believed the war with China would be easy. \u201cDon\u2019t go fighting with your land armies in China\u201d, was General Montgomery\u2019s second rule of warfare, and this was proven in the decade of war between the two powers. Countless numbers of people died in China\u2019s vast expanses, unwitnessed and unremembered. Rape, mutilation and torture were daily occurrences. We will never know just how many people lost their lives. Perhaps 50,000,000 people, maybe more, almost certainly not fewer. This includes around 30 million non-combatants, but the lines between soldier and civilians were so blurred that there is not much point drawing a line. The sheer, empty size of China, the destructive ferocity of the Japanese soldiers, the huge number of dead - everything about the war is utterly incomprehensible and inconceivable to most in Britain and America. Do not underestimate how much it affects the relationship between Japan and China today, and understand why it does. The carnage experienced in China\u2019s solemn hills and grief-filled fields is not easily forgotten. ",
