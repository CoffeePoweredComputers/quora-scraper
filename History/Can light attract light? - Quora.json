            "answer_text": "The photon sphere(s) of a black hole are unstable, so the net amount of light that might end up there is (almost certainly) not enough to self-react. If there's an accretion disk you might get all kinds of Compton scattering (with matter), and Hawking radiation is something weird with light. Wheeler suggested a circular ball of light so intense that its energy curved space time into a 'lens' that kept it confined in the middle. In this case, light is self-interacting, as it can also do in intense bursts of gamma rays.  In matter light can also interact with itself via 3 or 4 wave mixing, but that's not really relevant to your question! ",

            "answer_text": "No, light only travels in straight lines (according to the local geography). It is not attracted by anything, especially other photons. But when considering a black hole, yes. The momentum in photons absorbed by the black hole adds to the mass, thanks to energy-mass equivalence. Not sure what you mean by a black hole \"re-collapsing\". But no, the mass outside of a black hole cannot draw out the matter that has been lost to the singularity. All mass or energy outside the black hole can do is enlarge the black hole. ",
