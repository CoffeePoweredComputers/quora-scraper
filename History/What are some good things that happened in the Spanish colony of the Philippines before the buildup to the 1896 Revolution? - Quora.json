            "answer_text": "Public education. Spain instituted public education in the Philippines in the 1860's, by 1896 the Philippines had the second highest literacy in Asia, behind Japan. Spain also instituted centralised government and public infrastructure, such as parks, trains, canals, sewage and electric cars. Under the Spanish, the water ways in Manila were accessible and many people used boats to go around the city, while the Americans built one of the best ports in the Pacific in Manila Bay. Combined with the American and Spanish development of the Philippines, by the time the Japanese conquered the Philippines in 1942 the Philippines was on-par with Japan in terms of development. The Japanese were impressed with Manila, it was a better designed city than Tokyo and Manila became known as the Pearl of the Orient. The destruction of Manila in 1945 erased all of these developments and you can say the Philippines has still not recovered from World War II. World War II was the worst thing to happen to the Philippines, it completely destroyed centuries of development from Spain and the USA. ",

            "answer_text": "1) The rule of liberal Governor General Carlos Maria de la Torre (Dr. Rizal\u2019s, the Filipinos\u2019 national hero\u2019s most admired Spanish governor general) A Carlist army officer, he was sent from Spain by Francisco Serrano after the ouster of Queen Isabel II as result of the La Gloriosa revolution. He was considered a liberal Spaniard who practiced the liberal and democratic principles for imposing liberal laws. He wanted to have the bronze statue of Isabel II, first unveiled in 1860, melted so that it would be put to better use. However, the Manila City Council saved it by declaring the statue municipal property. He established the Guardia Civil in the Philippines and gave amnesty to rebels, of which the most prominent was Casimiro Camerino (El tulis\u00e1n), the leader of bandits in Cavite. He organized the bandits given amnesty into an auxiliary force of the Guardia Civil. He abolished flogging, relaxed media censorship, and began limited secularization of education. He was also very close to the ilustrados, a group of Filipinos who understood the situation of the Philippines under Spanish rule. His supporters had done a Liberal Parade in front of the Malaca\u00f1an Palace. Only two weeks after the arrival of de la Torre as governor-general, Burgos and Joaqu\u00edn Pardo de Tavera led a demonstration at the Plaza de Santa Potenciana. Among the demonstrators were Jos\u00e9 Icaza, J\u00e1cobo Zobel, Ignacio Rocha, Manuel Genato, and M\u00e1ximo Paterno. The cry was \"Viva Filipinas para los Filipinos!\". In November 1870, a student movement, denounced as a riot or mot\u00edn, at the University of Santo Tomas formed a committee to demand reforms on the school and its curricula. It later announced support of Philippine autonomy and recognition of the Philippines as a province of Spain. The committee was headed by Felipe Buencamino. De la Torre was single and he had a mistress who had great influence on him. His mistress, Maria del Rosario Gil de Montes de Sanchiz, flared up friar opposition because of many reasons. One of the reasons was she authored a book entitled El Hombre de Dios. It was criticized because a woman wrote it. Another is during a festivity in Malaca\u00f1ang Palace that was mainly attended by Philippine creoles, who are now definitely called Filipinos. She arrived at the place wearing a ribbon which said Viva la Libertad (English: Long live liberty) and Viva el Pueblo Soberano (English: Long live the sovereign nation). In March 1872, de la Torre wrote to Madrid concerning his decision to get relieved from his post. However, his patron in Spain was assassinated the previous month and orders for his relief was given nine days before his letter was written. He was succeeded by Governor-General Rafael de Izquierdo. 2) The rule of Governor General Jose Basco Basco\u2019s Reforms Filipino farmers and traders finally had a taste of prosperity when Governor General Jose Basco y Vargas instituted reforms intended to free the economy from its dependence on Chinese and Mexican trade. Basco implemented a \u201cgeneral economic plan\u201d aimed at making the Philippines self sufficient. He established the \u201cEconomic Society of Friends of the Country\u201d, which gave incentives to farmers for planting cotton, spices, and sugarcane; encouraged miners to extract gold, silver, tin, and copper; and rewarded investors for scientific discoveries they made. Tobacco Monopoly The tobacco industry was placed under government control during the administration of Governor General Basco. In 1781, a tobacco monopoly was implemented in the Cagayan Valley, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union, Isabela, Abra, Nueva Ecija, and Marinduque. Each of these provinces planted nothing but tobacco and sold their harvest only to the government at a pre-designated price, leaving little for the farmers. No other province was allowed to plant tobacco. The government exported the tobacco to other countries and also part of it to the cigarette factories in Manila. The tobacco monopoly successfully raised revenues for the colonial government and made Philippine tobacco famous all over Asia. 3) The rule of Governor General Emilio Terrero It was him who protected Dr. Jose Rizal against the latter\u2019s enemies and because of him, no Filipino was arrested for reading Dr. Rizal\u2019s Noli Me Tangere novel that exposes the abuses and fraud of the Spanish friars and some Spanish authorities.
