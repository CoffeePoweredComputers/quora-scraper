            "answer_text": "Kings typically owned many castles, manors, and lodges located in and around forests. Their seneschal would advice the stewards and castellans when to expect the royal household & what their needs would be. The royal seneschal would also notify the major nobles that the King would be visiting their castle or manor. Also, if the weather turned very nasty, the royal party might stay at a major monastery or convent even spreading his party out among several monasteries and convents in a certain area. The King might also stay in or near a city or town, especially if there was a major horse market or seasonal fair being conducted in the vicinity. It was important for the King's seneschal to make these arrangements not only because of the need for there to be adequate food and drink but also to ensure that hunts and other activities be arranged.

            "answer_text": "For several centuries the kings of England had no fixed abode, let alone in London, and the whole court moved from place to place, usually staying at the grandest house in each county for a month or two. Some rich noblemen built whole palaces hoping the king would come and stay, because making a good impression on the king would set them up for life. Some of these grand houses survive, and their tour guides can tell you whether the king ever arrived or not. ",

If not then Abbies or Monasteries where the Bishops and Archbishops were trusted. Failing that close friends who were in debt or seeking favors from the Court. Kinda like today with the rich and famous. Hope this helps. Cheers. ",
