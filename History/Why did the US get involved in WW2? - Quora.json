            "answer_text": "The short answer: Pearl Harbor. The long answer: Originally, the United States didn\u2019t want to join any faction within World War II. The US already saw the destruction that arose from WWI, and decided that for the benefit of both the US and American lives that the US should stay out of warfare. Now, at the same time of WWII, Japan was leading its pacific conquest. It was invading nearly every East Asian country that had a coast bordering the Pacific Ocean, and several countries had already been overtaken. South Korea and China are both examples of countries that have suffered from this Japanese invasion. Now, the Japanese knew that there was a chance that the United States wouldn\u2019t like the Japanese taking over Pacific areas, especially since the US had a military base in Hawaii. Thus, Hideki Tojo, the general of the Imperial Japanese Army, thought that since there were multiple US battleships stationed at Pearl Harbor, if the Japanese struck first and crippled a large portion of the US navy, the US would not be able to retaliate against the Japanese Pacific conquest for a long time. Thus, on December 7, 1941, the Japanese launched their attack on Pearl Harbor. This surprise attack led to the destruction of several US battleships and did indeed cripple part of the US navy. Many lives were lost, and we hold that day in remembrance to honor the lives of our fallen. Tojo thought this blow would be enough to keep the United States away from East Asia. He was wrong. Not only did the United States mobilize its industry to rebuild the navy at an incredibly astounding pace, the United States declared war on Japan, and Japan\u2019s allies soon after, which were Germany and Italy. Tojo greatly underestimated the power of the United States\u2019 industry at the time, believing that it was not powerful enough to rebuild the navy in time to stop Japan\u2019s conquest. Even though he was wrong, we did rethink naval warfare after that date. Instead of comprising our navy of mostly battleships, we switched to a navy dedicated to aircraft carriers, which became much more effective in naval warfare afterwards. So moral of the story? Choose your enemies wisely. ",

            "answer_text": "After all, the solidly isolationist U.S. sat out the first two years of the war\u2026 Here aviation hero and \u201cAmerica First\u201d leader Charles Lindbergh speaks out against the war on September 11th, 1941 (the same day ground was ceremoniously broken for construction of the Pentagon; the same day 60 years later that terrorists would fly a commercial jet into that same building sparking yet another seismic shift in political history)\u2026  MAYBE, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt didn't like Charles Lindbergh pointing out how unprepared the United States was, and \u2018defeatists\u2019 like Joseph Kennedy, U.S. Ambassador to Britain, who publicly insisted Britain couldn't hold out against the Nazis as bombs fell on London and German troops gathered to invade in the summer of 1940. MAYBE, with U.S. unemployment still at 17% in 1939, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt saw American entry into the war as a way to finally end the Great Depression so he started building his miliatry\u2026  MAYBE, he got the U.S. involved due to years of increasing political tensions with Germany and Japan and the Soviets\u2026 And because he had been warned and convinced about Germany\u2019s development of an atomic bomb in 1939. He consequently committed the U.S to the war in secret even before being re-elected for a third time in November 1940, promising the American public he wouldn\u2019t send our boys to fight another European war. He committed the U.S. by partnering with the British atomic bomb project \u201cTube Alloys\u201d and then absorbing it into the \u201cManhattan Project\u201d, a great gamble that would cost taxpayers over $22 billion (in 2018 dollars) and employ over 130,000 people in 3 countries. (He also sent U.S. troops to occupy Danish Greenland and Iceland in May and June 1940 as Denmark fell to the Nazis and the Soviets swept through the Baltic states.) MAYBE he saw his chance to eclipse the British Empire in world affairs. The U.S. was certainly well-prepared (See this rare U.S Office of Facts and Figures Report commissioned just before Peal Harbor: Report to the nation: the American preparation for war :: World War II - Documents ) Or maybe he simply made up his mind, looking out into the world: The light of a radical new vision was shining in the eyes of enraptured millions. It burned as it yearned for a new world order\u2026 A world without colonialism, or communism, or democracy. it bays for a \u2018purification\u2019 of the human species itself. Under it\u2019s spell, Germans, Italians and Japanese anointed themselves as master races, demanding more \u2018living space\u2019, greater resources, and millions upon millions of slaves for the wasting; forcing massive population displacements, cultural re-education, and ethnic cleansing. Oceans of humanity rallied with religious zeal, shouting \u2018Zieg Heil!\u2019, and \u2018Due-chay!\u2019, and \u2018Banzai!\u2019 and their brutal conquests rage across the continents of Europe, Africa, and Asia. Nazi\u2019s were even rallying in New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden in 1939\u2026 See: When 20,000 American Nazis Descended Upon New York City  Roosevelt knows he\u2019s not the only one who understands the peculiar new power of \u2018fireside chats\u2019, newsreels, and the explosion of printed media. The new mind-masters have been inspiring imaginations and manipulating emotions, spreading hate and fear, with the black arts of propaganda and psychological warfare. Massive rallies have dazzled.  Modern warfare, unprecedented in scope, utilizing incredibly powerful new weapons in concert with revolutionized air power has been flickering in the darkness of theaters everywhere and in the back of minds for years. He sees the war that\u2019s coming is a war where entire races, religions and cultures may be targeted for extermination. Civilian populations will be decimated by design, and much more than they were in the first world war; over 55 million unarmed men, women, and children will be left dead in this war\u2019s wake. In fact, life is so cheap to these aggressors they will often kill their own wounded troops, or order their suicides, for honor and mercy and preserving resources. It's a terrifying war that will too often take no prisoners; a war of human medical experiments, efficient death camps, industrial-scale forced labor, scorched earth, and military-sanctioned rape and sexual slavery. Military needs in the fascist countries had long since taken priority over every national program and resource. Any inconvenient ethical or legal restraint has been ignored. \u201cThe fascist state is a will to power and empire\u2026 Empire is not only a territorial or military or mercantile aspiration, but a spiritual and moral one\u2026 For the fascist, everything is in the state, and no human or spiritual thing exists, or has any sort of value, outside the state. In this sense fascism is totalitarian, and the synthesis and unity of every value which interprets, develops, and strengthens the entire life of the people\u2026\u201d (Benito Mussolini, 1932, Doctrine of Fascism). \u201cBelieve; Obey; Fight!\u201d (Italian National Fascist Party motto).  \u201c\u2026The current crisis is not like wars of the past \u2013 conflicts that were waged largely to redraw the global map. After several centuries of truly dynamic history, [Japan is] mobilizing to achieve a huge leap in horizons for humanity, [and in] the outlook for the nation, the world, politics, education, economics, art, religion and in all other domains. A new world is hungering to be born, with the Emperor of Japan as the mother\u2019s body\u2026 To offer his single life to the Emperor is the true worth of any son of Japan\u201d - Shigenobu Mochizuki, May 1st 1939, Captain Japanese Army, letter before departing for the front (Cherry Blossoms in the Wind \u2013 Letters from soldiers who died in WWII). Roosevelt sees that the \u2018state\u2019 is becoming a divinity overseas. And it demands more than just hearts and minds; it\u2019s a cult of personality that lays claim to the very souls of its citizens. Why don't more people see it coming? Adolf Hitler, an ordinary soldier wounded in World War I, has risen since the Great Market Crash of 1929 to literally become Germany\u2019s \u201csavior\u201d, a political messiah. By 1939, his autobiographical book Mein Kampf (My Struggle) has sold over 5.2 million copies in 11 different languages - - and even in braille, so \u2018that the blind may see\u2019. Already it's become a tradition in Germany - - the \u2018Nazi bible\u2019 given free to every German newlywed couple, and handed to soldiers leaving for their first battlefield. In it Hitler promised to break the oppressive Treaty of Versailles, and then, incredibly, Britain and France allowed him to do it. He also promised to establish a German master race that would destroy \u201cJewish Bolshevism\u201d in a \u201cwar of annihilation\u201d and to occupy the Soviet Union. To those ends, \u201cGott mit uns\u201d is the German army\u2019s motto. As it was during the First World War, it\u2019s pressed into the brass of Wehrmacht\u2019s belt buckles; yes, \u2018God is With Us\u2019 - - still.  God is with Japan too, as embodied by Hirohito, their own god-emperor, who is worshipped daily by every good Japanese. He is their living deity within Shinto, Japan\u2019s state religion. The emperor\u2019s rule is described as \u201cHakko Ichiu\u201d; divinely ordained to expand until it covers the entire world. But first the Japanese demand freedom from the threats of western powers; they demand self-sufficiency and security as a bloc of Asian nations in the name of their emperor. They call this vision the \u201cGreater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\u201d and the Japanese Imperial Army has been accomplishing it by \u201cannexing\u201d Taiwan in 1895, then Korea in 1910, and Manchuria in 1931. They bombed the people of Shanghai in 1932 and massacred hundred\u2019s of thousands of unarmed civilians in the Republic of China\u2019s capital Nanjing in 1937; all for the sake of \u2018regional security\u2019; all justified in the name of a greater good: freedom - - freedom for the Japanese. They tell the story of a populous and growing island nation with limited natural resources, in a rapidly shrinking world, besieged by aggressive colonial powers. They are desperately fighting for their lives in self-defense.  Similarly, a re-baptized Benito Mussolini has granted Vatican City sovereignty within the confines of Rome and has been proclaimed \u201cthe Man of Providence\u201d by Pope Pius XI. With God on his side too, Italian legions went forth to fight in Africa and the Balkans for the glorious destino of a New Roman Empire, and for control of the entire Mediterranean. Mussolini occupies Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in 1936, after pitting the latest planes and tanks and mustard gas against spears, and flintlocks, and unarmed civilians. His 17-year-old son Bruno triumphantly pilots a four-engined bomber during the campaign. Then, even after total victory, his brutal troops executed the monks and novices of Debre Libanos Monastery, and proceeded to slaughter 30,000 villagers in Addis Ababa (a reprisal for a supposed attempted assassination of Italian East Africa\u2019s Viceroy). But Hitler, and many other world leaders admire Mussolini for bringing \u201cprogress\u201d and \u201cmaking the trains run on time\u201d. Against all odds he actually makes fascism appealing.  They are all men of destiny. Hundreds of millions of wildly cheering people believe in them, and promise to sacrifice for them. Joseph Stalin too, is a man of destiny. But he is exceptional. He rules over 190 million souls and nearly 10,000,000 square miles of resource wealth, the world\u2019s largest single country and a superpower with the 2nd largest GDP. While fascism was strongly idealistic, communism insisted it was realistic. By 1939 Stalin has consolidated his control by killing millions of his own people through ruthless purges, and by working political exiles to death in Siberia\u2019s gulag system. He has engineered famines by forcing the \u2018collectivization\u2019 of all farming. And this Soviet gospel of communism has already infected nearly every country on earth, drawing battle lines between the rich and poor. Extolling against all religion, his movement spreads like an exciting new church exploiting the destitution of economic depressions around the world, and insidiously establishes itself in the form of labor unions and violent international brotherhoods for seizing \u2018the means of all production\u2019. Ultimately entire governments will be absorbed as satellite states loyal to Stalin in his worldwide war against the dark forces of capitalism.  Like Hitler and Mussolini, Stalin pioneers an appealing new political language for the dawning age of mass media. Its cultish jargon bestows membership and brotherhood. Its half-truths rewrite history. Everyday words are distorted, disguised, and reversed to confuse their meanings in the service of spreading lies; lies that advance the communist agenda. Stalin tells us: \u201cThe writer is the engineer of the human soul; print is the sharpest and strongest weapon of our party\u201d\u2026 \u201cEducation is a weapon whose effect depends on who holds it in his hands, and against who it is aimed\u201d\u2026 \u201cIdeas are more powerful than guns; we would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let people have their own ideas?\u201d Then, ultimately, \u201cdeath is the solution to all problems; no man, no problem\u201d. And while \u201cthe death of one man may be a tragedy; the death of millions is a mere statistic\u201d. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of August 1939 secretly triggers the Second World War to the ringing of champagne glasses and toasts. Stalin has duplicitously allied himself with Hitler and will supply him with vital war materials that enable the defeat of Western Europe. He invades and occupies half of Poland and parts of Romania. He invades Finland and annexes Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Stalin and Hitler will be allies for 22 months.  And during his 28-year reign Stalin would preside over the liquidation of over 20,000,000 Soviet civilians. He would instigate a 46-year \u201cCold War\u201d, enjoin an atomic arms race of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) capable of ending all human life, and inspire murderous revolutions around the world. The Spanish Civil War, the slaughters of Abyssinia and Albania, the Rapes of China and Manchuria, Hitler\u2019s marches into Austria and Czechoslovakia, the ongoing communist purges in the U.S.S.R., the massive persecution of Jews, the centuries-old struggle of native peoples everywhere against oppressive colonialism, and so much more, all converges by late 1939 into the return of another World War racing and raging towards destiny. The world has never seen such suffering and death, but these idealistic aggressors - - these dreamers - - will stop at nothing to see what greatness might be on the other side for them. The world has burned wildly with their visions and violence for years by late 1941\u2026 Yet Hawaii still lies safely distant in the vastness of the Pacific Ocean. Honolulu is some 3,800 air miles from Tokyo, 7,300 miles from Berlin, and 8,000 miles from Rome. At the same time she is closer to the United States, her protector; 2,100 miles away from San Francisco; 2,300 miles from Dutch Harbor in Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Islands; and 4,700 miles from the Panama Canal which connects her to the Atlantic. And in her distance she remains the world\u2019s enduring and exotic dream of escape; the picture of peacefulness and honeymoons and starry beaches; a spiritual immersion of natural beauty. Some even muse she might be the Garden of Eden reborn, a pilgrimage destination for healing souls and second chances; a place for remembering to forget. In the embrace of her soft, jasmined nights, and as radios quietly murmur the world news, Hawaiians feel especially lucky. But one clear Sunday morning, the \u2018new world order\u2019 comes - - even for Hawaii. Even for America. Radar picks up a large squadron of unidentified planes approaching Oahu but it\u2019s discounted. Forty-five minutes later, coastal spotters sight the first Japanese Zero\u2019s. They can\u2019t quite believe their own eyes, and their reports sound confused. Then the bombs come whistling down upon Battleship Row, and Honolulu is strafed. As the fire brigades and rescue crews struggle, and salvage operations get started, something ineffable builds to critical mass in American hearts and minds. The moment of truth explodes into headlines and the outrage becomes a runaway, self-sustaining chain reaction. America has suddenly awakened, and she\u2019ll turn the tide of the Second World War, resetting the 20th century with it...  Sunday, December 7th, 1941: 13:18 (Local Washington D.C. Time) Oahu, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii is struck by 353 Japanese planes in two furious waves at 07:48 Hawaiian time. In less than 90 minutes, 2,403 Americans are killed and 1,178 are wounded; 16 ships are sunk or damaged, including 5 battleships. 188 U.S. aircraft are also lost. Japanese losses are just 64 men killed and 1 captured; 29 aircraft downed and 5 midget Subs sunk or beached. The attack was not supposed to commence until 30 minutes after Japan had informed the United States of its withdrawal from peace negotiations. Instead, bombs fell before Japan\u2019s 5,000-word notice could be decoded and translated by the Japanese Embassy in time for their ambassador to deliver it to U.S. Secretary of State, Cordell Hull. Even so, their intended 30-minute notice neither declared war nor severed diplomatic relations. But \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d is just one of MANY simultaneous attacks against American, British, and Dutch territories across Asia and the Pacific. Basement teletypes in Washington D.C. won't stop clattering. Inch by excruciating inch, hour by hour, the ticker tapes deliver shock after shock into trembling hands, overwhelming belief\u2026 The day\u2019s news is too much, too fast, too terrifying to fully grasp; the mind wants a simple word, a single name for it\u2026 Pearl Harbor. Yes, but\u2026 13:00 (Local Washington D.C. Time) The bombardment of Kota Bahru in Malaya begins precisely at 01:00 AM, December 8th, local time, actually 18 minutes before the attack on Pearl Harbor (December 8th, because Kota Bahru is on the other side of the International Dateline from Hawaii). Waves of landing craft are underway just 15 minutes later. Casualties are heavy on both sides. Japanese commanders will later recall the landing as the hardest, bloodiest fighting of the entire Malaya campaign\u2026 13:00 (Local Washington D.C. Time) Bangkok is bombed right on schedule in tandem with Kota Bahru. Japanese troops simultaneously mount a massive full-scale invasion at several points along the southern Thai Coast from the Gulf of Siam to fierce, yet desperate resistance of civilians, local youth cadets, policemen, and small army units. The Thai\u2019s couldn\u2019t respond to the Japanese ultimatum, delivered just 120 minutes earlier, because their fascist-admiring Prime Minister, Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkram is oddly unreachable. The Japanese Ambassador to Thailand informs the Thai Minister of Foreign Affairs that \u201cJapan is fighting for its life against Great Britain and the United States\u201d, but if Thailand joins Japan it will guarantee it\u2019s sovereignty, independence, and honor, and also restore all territories Thailand had previously lost to the foreign colonial powers. Meanwhile, as these attacks rage, Pearl Harbor somehow fails to go on alert due to mysterious communication delays and discounted radar reports\u2026 Later that desperate day a ceasefire clears the way for over 100,000 Japanese troops to stream through Thailand. 70,000 of them race south for Malaya, many on commandeered bicycles\u2026  15:30 (Local Washington D.C. Time) \u201cFortress\u201d Singapore wakes to heavy bombing at 04:30 AM local time, from Japanese planes based in Vichy-French Indochina\u2019s Vietnam and Cambodia. Sunrise reveals nearly 1,000 broken and bloodied casualties within the city\u2019s blazing ruins; this is how they received their first news of war breaking in Southeast Asia. The battleship HMS Prince of Wales and battle cruiser HMS Repulse hastily leave Singapore without any air support to hunt down the main Japanese landing force convoy steaming somewhere in the Gulf of Siam just off the Malayan coast. Two days later, both capital ships will be torpedo-bombed and sunk with the loss of 840 sailors, including Prince of Wales\u2019 high-ranking officers, Admiral Sir Tom Phillips and Captain John Leach who choose to go down together with their ship.  15:50 (Local Washington D.C. Time) Wake Island, bombed and strafed, then more raids follow. Japan\u2019s first attempt to land 2,500 infantrymen is turned back by the 449 Marines with their six 5-inch guns and anti-aircraft batteries. When asked by reporters via shortwave radio about their need for reinforcements and supplies, garrison commander Winfield Cunningham replies, \u201cSend me more Japs\u201d. The heroic resistance inflicts at least 1,000 casualties, destroying 6 Japanese warships, including two destroyers, and damaging or destroying at least 28 aircraft before the stubborn American territory surrenders on December 23rd As POW\u2019s, the Americans will be forced to re-fortify the island while an American submarine blockade starves all prisoners and Japanese alike. 98 captive American civilian workers will be summarily machine-gunned after their forced labor is no longer needed (though one would miraculously escape). Future President George H. W. Bush flies his first combat mission over Wake - - one of many raids on the island during the war - - but Wake would not be re-taken until after the Japanese surrender in 1945.  16:31 (Local Washington D.C. Time) Midway Atoll, another American territory, bombarded by 302 rounds from two Japanese destroyers at 09:31 local time. The U.S. Marines of Sand Island respond with damaging counter-fire from their 1916-vintage guns, forcing Japan\u2019s warships to retire. Four marines die that morning; one of them, 1st Lieutenant George H. Cannon, is posthumously awarded the first Medal of Honor issued to a marine during the war. Japanese submarines would return to bombard the garrison, but the reinforced atoll would hold out for months until the great naval Battle of Midway, the world\u2019s first hide-and-seek carrier force contest, fought with luck and entirely by air that the American\u2019s will miraculously and decisively win.  17:27 (Local Washington D.C. Time) Guam, bombed again and again, then landed by 5,900 Japanese infantry and marines. The besieged American territory\u2019s lightly defended garrison of 547 marines and sailors, and 4 nurses, surrenders at 06:00 on December 10th and the undersea telegraph cable linking the Philippines to the U.S west coast is lost. The 225-square-mile island is not only strategically vital, but home to 23,394 Chamorro\u2019s. One US. Navy radioman, George Ray Tweed, eludes capture, setting off a 2 1/2 year search and waves of Japanese reprisals, torture, beheadings, and terror. But the Chamorro\u2019s never gave him up. 19:00 (Local Washington D.C. Time) Hong Kong is bombed too. It\u2019s soon invaded and surrenders on Christmas Day after suffering incredible Japanese atrocities, over 4,000 civilian deaths, 2,000 military deaths, 5,000 severely wounded, 10,000 soldiers captured, and over 10,000 women raped. After weeks of hard fighting, the Japanese have lost just 675 men, then days of violent looting follow the surrender. Hong Kong becomes a Japanese colony until September 1945. Over half the population will desperately starve or flee.  23:40 (Local Washington D.C. Time) The Philippines, yet another American territory, is attacked at 12:40 local time, and Japanese troops begin immediately landing at Batan Island, and then two days later at Luzon Island.  Macarthur is stunned by the news of Pearl Harbor and the many other Japanese attacks, so much so he wavers for almost 9 precious hours about how to respond. At 0330 he is warned by Washington to expect an attack. At 0530 he receives direct orders from General George Marshall to attack the Japanese air bases on Formosa but decides to disobey them. He also fails to place his command on full alert, and refuses to contact or confer with the commander of his Far East Air Forces until around 1100. Then its too late: the Japanese surprise 35 B-17\u2019s - - the largest such force outside the continental United States - - and nearly all of the 107 P-40 and P-35 fighters with other planes on the ground while waiting wing-tip to wing-tip, loading up with bombs and refueling. Half of them are wiped out within 45 minutes. The rest are destroyed over the next few days, thus giving the Japanese complete control of the skies and sea, leading to the worst American land defeat in history. The main invasion forces land on Mindanao on December 20th and on Luzon, December 22nd - - with 57,000 and 43,000 men respectively. Manila falls quickly, just after New Year\u2019s Day. The United States never even tries to supply or reinforce the Philippines, then MacArthur is ordered to Australia in March, leaving 151,000 American and Filipino troops behind to their doom. But as Filipino and American forces stubbornly resist, the Japanese ready plague-bombs for use on the Bataan Peninsula, the same biological weapons they had used on the Chinese, but Wainwright\u2019s brave surrender in May makes it mercifully unnecessary. All along Japanese atrocities have been widespread throughout the islands, but this is just the beginning\u2026 \u2026All this tragedy within just 10 hours. This was the Christmas season of 1941. This was what Franklin Roosevelt had foreseen. This is what it took to jar a solidly isolationist nation into the Second World War. American lunch counters and dinner tables are abuzz. Japan could attack Hawaii again - - any day now. Yeah, they struck the British, Dutch, and American strongholds simultaneously so that neither of them could aid the other. Now Hawaii could be turned against the United States. A Japanese naval blockade from there would cut communications and vital supplies from the United States to what remained of her territories and allies in Asia. Hawaii would also serve as a powerful base for carrier attacks against the West Coast and even the Panama Canal. To Japanese minds their attacks are poetic justice; karmic payback for Roosevelt\u2019s devastating oil and gasoline embargos levied against Japan 4 months earlier, demanding they leave China, Manchukuo, and Indo-China. Earlier he had also set embargoes on vital commodities like scrap metals (74% of Japan\u2019s scrap iron came from the U.S.), steel, and aviation gasoline, closed off the Panama Canal to Japanese shipping, and froze Japanese financial assets for similar reasons to no apparent effect. With just one humiliating stroke of his pen, Roosevelt had effectively cut nearly 90% of Japan\u2019s entire fuel supply, leaving her with less than 12 months of reserves for launching a naval war in the Pacific, continuing her war in China, and feeding her industrial and civilian needs. The expanding Imperial Japanese Navy alone needs over 400 tons of oil every hour just to maintain its combat readiness. (At the same time Japan is also well aware that Standard Oil is still quietly selling oil and tetraethyl aviation gasoline to the Nazi\u2019s - - where were the embargos against them; FDR\u2019s intentions are clear.) Meanwhile, Winston Churchill receives news that the capital ships HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales have both just been sunk, moving him to later say: \u201cIn all the war I never received a more direct shock. As I turned and twisted in bed the full horror of the news sank in upon me. There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean, or the Pacific, except the American survivors of Pearl Harbor who were hastening back to California. Over this vast expanse of waters, Japan was supreme, and we, everywhere, were weak and naked\u201d. 12:30 PM, Washington D.C. Local Time, December 8th\u2026 Time seems to be crawling. It\u2019s been nearly 24 hours since the attack on Pearl Harbor, yet still no official government response; still no final decision about going to war. Nine hours earlier, Britain had declared war on Japan in solidarity and hope that America would join the war. The Netherlands, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and Panama have already declared war many hours ago too. The entire world collectively holds its breath wondering; why is Roosevelt hesitating? Finally, President Roosevelt adjourns a special joint session of Congress and broadcasts his address live to a nation still in shock. 81% of all American households nervously, angrily, excitedly tune in; it\u2019s the largest radio audience in American history. Here\u2019s how he finally explained it:  And the mixed tragedy that followed\u2026  ",
