            "answer_text": "It was not the \u201cLouisiana Territory\u201d. This is an US concept. The French did not use that concept and in fact it did not exist yet. For the French, it was the royal province of Louisiana (province royale de la Louisiane), one of the colonies of their alleged vice-royalty of New France (vice-royaut\u00e9 de Nouvelle-France). The part of the claim that was east of the Mississippi went to the English, and the west part went to the Spanish. Other answers explained well the context for the Treaty of Paris of 1763. Therefore keep in mind that what the US would later call the State of Illinois for example would also be considered \u201cLouisiana\u201d, even if it would never be part of the future \u201cLouisiana Territory\u201d. The French concept of Louisiana did not fit the US concept of Louisiana Territory. For the French on the ground, they kept going back and forth that border until it became more and more complicated due to the requirements of trade passports\u2026 For the French, there was an English Louisiana and a Spanish Louisiana now. For them, the question was on which side they preferred to live. When the English introduced Chickasaws there (enemies of both the Illinois and the French) and when the US rebels would not pay for the merchandises they bought, the choice became clear. Indigenous, French, Spanish, English and later the US all had their own understanding of the territory and each added a layer of claims and territorial imagination to the place, and in the context of the 1763 Treaty of Paris, the US understanding of the territory was not there yet, so you have to give up using US terminology as it\u2019s anachronistic. As a \u201cprovince\u201d of New Spain, the new Spanish Louisiana (Luisiana) would now be part of the vice-royalty of New Spain (virreinato de Nueva Espa\u00f1a), and have to obey to their vice-roy, and was in the juridiction of the Spanish Council of the Indies (Consejo de las Indias), and one of the Spanish governors of Louisiana was even formerly a governor of the Kingdom of Guatemala (Reino de Guatemala). Spanish laws, such as the Siete Partidas of Castile, were added to the Custom of Paris (Coutume de Paris) already used in Louisiana. The Custom of Paris might have survived as well in English Louisiana\u2026 but all of these projects were erased when it was ceded to the US. The French of English Louisiana petitioned the US Congress to have their laws acknowledged but they were not. As for the indigenous, their sovereignties still were present. For exemple, the Osage had the real control over the Lower Missouri river and it was necessary to give them something to circulate. ",

            "answer_text": "The British and the French signed The Treaty of Paris in 1763, officially ending the war. The peace negotiations involved Spain. Britain had declared war on Spain in 1762 and had taken control of Spanish possessions. Spain, entered the war on the French side, had to give Florida to Great Britain. To repay Spain for its losses, France transferred the Louisiana Territory - including New Orleans - to Spain. For the French, the defeat was bitter. France was left with no land in North America. ",
