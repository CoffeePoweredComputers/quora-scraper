            "answer_text": "This is a very difficult question to answer definitively, because the fall of Rome happened so long ago, and because the question is very general and does not say which of Rome\u2019s several incarnations you are talking about. For example, Romans already spoke of their \u201cImperium,\u201d their Empire or the area under their command, during the Republic, before it was co-opted by generals and dictators. The traditions of the Republic, the way power was carefully divided and controlled, with 2 consuls elected to oversee each other, was intended to be one of the least autocratic systems in the world. Could THAT have survived longer than it did? As Rome expanded her territories, opportunities increased for corruption and exploitation. Generals flushed with victory had access to a colossal amount of gold, silver, slaves and other goods. They could use that to gain power and influence people. Rome\u2019s many wars created repeated crises, and to cope with that, the senate granted leaders temporary absolute power and the title of dictator. The idea was that after the emergency the temporary leader would go back to being a normal senator, farmer or whatever. That happened sometimes. Sometimes dictators clung on, or were awarded extra powers, or manipulated the system. Another problem was that as new provinces were added, the army grew in size, complexity, power, efficiency and influence, as well as moving further away, and being harder to control. Caesar knew this. He had deliberately conquered Gaul in order to get enough gold, slaves, power and prestige to march on Rome and seize absolute power. Caesar wrote his book: \u201cCommentaries On the Gallic War,\u201d as dispatches from the front, with parts of it set up in public places in Rome as the war unfolded. Caesar destroyed the Republic, and wanted to be king, like an oriental monarch. So he was stabbed to death by Brutus, Cassius, and others. Could Rome have survived as a republic? That\u2019s a difficult question, but I can tell you that Rome was a republic for hundreds of years. It so happened that Rome\u2019s territories were limited at the time the Republic was stable. Sudden huge gains in territory and wealth rendered the republic unworkable. So, for that political system to function, with the 2 consuls holding real power, Rome probably would have to have kept itS empire modest in size! That wasn\u2019t impossible. It\u2019s a curious fact that when what we think of as the Empire began, under Augustus, all the structure of the republic survived. There was just this one man, Augustus, who insisted modestly that he was only grudgingly accepting yet another 10 year installment of the monarchy. He called himself \u201cprimus inter pares,\u201d the first among equals, and it was as if the Republic still remained. But Augustus controlled everything. Could the early Roman Empire have survived? I am talking about the period between 31 B.C. and 180\u2013220 A.D. which saw long periods of economic growth, great peace and prosperity for the Romans, and even some slaves, who were able to become wealthy. This was the period when the city of Rome became grander and grander, with many monuments and fine buildings. It was also the case that aqueducts stretched 60\u201370 miles out of Rome, and that the city was better-supplied with water than was New York in the 1980s, according to some estimates. Such large ships as existed then would never been seen again in the Mediterranean till the 19th century. Could that have survived? I saw a wonderful documentary in the You Tube Time Line series about Vespasian. He is famous for having created a urine tax. But he was very practical. After the chaotic year of 4 emperors, Vespasian sorted things out, setting Rome back on the path of stability and greatness. He only ruled about 10 years but was influential. A bit later came the Age of the Antonines, between about 90 A.D. and 180. This was Rome\u2019s finest period, when emperor\u2019s adopted their successors, selecting them for executive ability. The system worked, because civil wars stopped. Had that system of adopting the emperor been permanent, Rome might have lasted longer. But Marcus Aurelius chose his irresponsible son, Commodus, to follow him. Commodus made enemies, and Rome went back to having disastrous rulers that it took civil war to remove. That brought the army back into politics, and the constant fighting of the third century A.D. weakened the empire. The system began to unravel. The empire declined. For Rome to survive, that would all have to be avoided. Rome was strong, yet fragile. People have pointed out that it was dependent on armies conquering new lands and bringing slaves and gold just for economic growth. That\u2019s not the full truth. But expansion of an empire that was already too big would weaken it more. Also, an army fighting against itself allowed opportunists to step in and weaken Rome more. How could the great period of Rome have survived? It might have had to avoid civil wars entirely. Also, if it had survived, the empire might have to be more like China or Ancient Egypt, with their capacity to absorb immigrants who would then be seduced by the dominant culture. A Rome that survived would either have to create an age of science and an industrial revolution in ancient times, because that would totally reset the parameters, and keep Rome stronger than her neighbours. Or they would have to start behaving more like China, in the sense that the people just absorb invadors, and charm them into thinking the only way to rule a conquered empire is to get the invadors to accept and adopt the imperial customs, and allow the Romans to go on being Roman. It might have happened that way. However, Greek science would maybe have stopped progressing as it did in our timeline, if there was only one patron to appeal to. ",

            "answer_text": "I would argue that the Roman Empire still exists culturally too. A lot of things in Western culture have its roots in Latin and Roman Culture. I\u2019ll use the US and American culture/traditions as my example since that\u2019s the one I\u2019m most familiar with. Language: About 60% of English has some sort of root (and about 90% of the two-syllable words). When it comes to the words in the language that we consider to be high-class or difficult, they\u2019re almost all Latin-based. When you look at the preferred second language of the intellectually and economically elite, it\u2019s French (Latin-based) or actual Latin.Professional: What we consider to be the elite professions (Medicine, Law, Math, Government/International Relationships, All Sciences) are riddled with Latin abbreviations and terminology. Even literature and many other fields sport Latin terminology in their technical language.Government: 20 US states (that\u2019s 40%) have Latin Mottos. Our whole system of government is based off of the Roman Senate, with some tweaks. The Founding Fathers took the Senate of Rome and altered it a little, then added the House of Representatives to complement it and so on. The name of all of our government branches are Latin-based. Even the word President is Latin-based. Other things started/influenced by Rome: the Census, two-party system, congressional comittees, etc (\u2190 also Latin-based). Even the systems of colonies and provinces are mirrored today. Even the US does this - else what are Puerto Rico, Guam, and many other \u201cterritories.\u201dReligion: Technically, Christianity is a Roman religion. Since the first 400 or so years of the religion grew up in the Roman Empire proper, many customs were absorbed from the Romans. Most famously, Christmas was adapted from the Roman Saturnalia. Except for a few details, you\u2019d easily confuse the two. In Roman Catholicism, certain positions and traditions were adopted from Roman religious traditions (hence the \u201cRoman). The Papacy is an extention of the Pontifex Maximus. Certain priests and orders are an extension of the Flamines. The nuns are an extension of the Vestal Virgins, and so on.Engineering: The way we plan our cities (a city town with all the major goods/services with the rest of the city sprawling out from that point) also can from Rome. Many other engineering feats, such as indoor plumbing (at least water) were Roman technology.Family: The basic family structure in the west has came from Rome (likely, earlier), with a Patriarch (a grandfather usually) ruling the family and making major decisions and other units within the family carrying our lessor directives to enhance the clout of the family. All children were married off, but women had little role usually until they were married. Men handled things outside the house. Women handles things inside. This has only recently started to be upended since the 1950s, and you still see many similarities in old-school upper class families, though it\u2019s not limited to a patriarch anymore.Literature: A lot of our literally (like, almost all) follows basic Latin/Greek tropes. Many works of fiction make use of Latin and Roman Mythology (Harry Potter is the besy example). Many works of non-fiction make literary allusions, which eventually means making allusions to Latin and Rome.Entertainment: What is MMA but gladitorial combat (Gladiators were not killed as often as you think. It was basically UFC with weapons.)? What are horse races or nascar but the Circus Maximus? Wrestling? Greek, actually. Running? Also Greek. Theater? Roman/Greek.I can keep going on, but I\u2019m tired of typing. ",
