            "answer_text": "It failed because its most prominent backers were members of the educated and professional classes who had very little power. The constitution also had some backing from the lower and middle bourgeoisie, another group with little power at the time. The constitution was largely rejected by the German aristocracy and by the monarchs whose power it threatened. At the time (1849), a majority of Germans were peasants, who largely remained obedient to their aristocratic leaders. The aristocrats and monarchs were also able to count on the support of much of the wealthy bourgeoisie, who benefited from their connections to the aristocracy and the monarchies. The aristocrats and monarchs controlled most of Germany\u2019s armies. This was certainly the case for the Prussian army, the most powerful in Germany, which quickly and fairly easily suppressed resistance on the part of backers of the constitution. ",
