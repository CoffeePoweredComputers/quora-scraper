            "answer_text": "After geophysical survey and seismic survey shows the potential for oil reservoirs in a area the drilling for oil starts.oil is removed by first drilling a well.THE WELL IS DRILLED BUT UNLIKE WATER WELL THESE WELLS ARE DRILLED VERY DEEP.After drilling the wells the core samples are collected from the cuttings and tested in laboratory to evaluate parameters like formation permeability porosity and water saturation.While drilling well logging is done side by side for formation evaluation .studying the well logging parameters the depth for the pay zone is calculated.Further drilling is done untill pay zone is reached .pay zone means the zone which contains oil.Once the well is drilled uptill the payzone then the payzone is perforated and production of oil starts.This is the most basic version of oil wells drilling.Their are Manny many many steps which I have not mentioned .thank for a2a ",
