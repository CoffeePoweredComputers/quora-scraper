            "answer_text": "I think this story is the perfect segway into my answer. It captures the whole concept in one photo. Meghan McCain on Who Joe Biden Should and Shouldn't Pick for His VP  (Credit: ET Online | Yes she\u2019s sitting on his lap!) I highly recommend you read this article. Not just because of how well its written and the timing of it, but she\u2019s thinking \u201cTammy Duckworth\u201d.  If the highly connected, politically savvy Megan points in Tammy\u2019s direction, the likelihood that Biden\u2019s handlers are going in her direction is a smart guess, better than the other candidates. Why is this endorsement significant? Because the establishment who actually tells Biden what to do, desperately needs to be back in control of the White House. So how do they get that done? Think about it\u2026 Biden\u2019s handlers know everything rides on their VP pick. They are torn between find a competent person who will follow orders and a person who has some novelty in a victim class. Tammy is a good choice, but they run the risk of her going rogue. She\u2019s smart. She has her own mind. She\u2019s got grit and determination that would be impossible to control. If they pick her, then she\u2019s the first woman President, on Biden\u2019s improbable win. Which leads me to my answer. No, Biden hasn\u2019t picked his running mate, yet. But his handlers have. They are just trying to get it so that she\u2019s the second bitter pill everyone has to swallow. Why Biden\u2019s Smart to Take His Time With His Veep Pick Think about it. They must find a person willing to cover up for their crimes. The establishment can\u2019t afford Trump four more years and both houses. They put all their cards into stacking this deck! Megan said she can\u2019t see Susan Rice, because she\u2019s never held public office. If that was the criteria, then she\u2019s right, on it\u2019s face, but Megan can\u2019t see the main objective. Susan Rice is already their choice, because she\u2019s the only one trusted to cover up all of the Obama administration\u2019s secrets. She\u2019s the only one who can be \u201chandled\u201d. Megan\u2019s anti-endorsement of Susan Rice, is actually the signal to everyone else that Susan Rice is exactly who they\u2019re going to pick. Disclaimer: IF I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m wrong and I will breath a sigh of relief, right along side everyone else. However, know this: The Democrats got themselves in a PICKLE. If Biden is elected, then the VP WILL be the first woman President. A distinction they promised to Hillary Clinton, but failed to deliver. To have the FIRST woman President has to be more \u201cstoried\u201d than the first minority President. They can\u2019t find a hand puppet for that job. She will feel empowered and the press will HAVE to look the other way. The establishment ABSOLUTELY needs to pick a woman they can CONTROL and that\u2019s how EFFED up Biden made things for them. ",

            "answer_text": "VP running mates are chosen to \u201cbalance\u201d the ticket. This means that they are chosen to shore up their perceived weaknesses. Obama picked Biden because he was looking for a moderate white guy to ensure whites he wasn\u2019t a radical. There was no love and no common belief between the two men. It was just a deal. By the same token, Trump knew he need the evangelicals. With his position on abortion he had a good chance to lock them up. By picking Pence he was trying to lock that vote in place. Again, Trump and Pence weren\u2019t buddy buddy. It was a political deal. Biden (or his advisors) looks at the electorate and realize that the democrats are loosing the white vote more and more every year. HRC only got 34%. He desperately needs the turnout of black vote that Obama got and he needs 90%+ of it. He feels a black women can deliver that. Whether he is right or not is something we shall see. ",
