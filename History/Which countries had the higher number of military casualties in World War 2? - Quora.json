            "answer_text": "The Soviet Union had the most casualties during the war including civilians. About 27 million Russians died in the war because they were unprepared and were caught off guard by Hitler\u2019s surprise attack on them in June 1941. It took the Soviets until late 1942 during the Battle of Stalingrad to start pushing the Germans back. Germany was also not that far off. About 10 million Germans were killed in battle too. ",
