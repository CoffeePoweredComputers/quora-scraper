            "answer_text": "As someone else has said, Ch'an Buddhism\u2014which came to be known as \"Zen Buddhism\" in Japan\u2014had syncretized with Shint\u014d, and Japan had remained mostly very passive about their faith in either. Christianity demands rejection of everything God says goes against Him and His ways. That said, the Catholic Church had been openly missioning to Japan for a century and a half, gaining a sizeable official number of converts and their children reportedly baptized into the faith. (Due to the dubious nature of infant baptism and the difficulty in statisticizing true repentant conversion, take from that what you will.) However, regent Toyotomi Hideyoshi had caught wind of the systematic colonialism by which European powers let the missionaries go save souls before invading the countries themselves. Hideyoshi's claim to power was already flimsy: his humble beginnings\u2014along his patronage of Oda Nobunaga, the guy who overthrew the last sh\u014dgun\u2014led the emperor to exercise what little rights he had, in denying Hideyoshi that same title of sh\u014dgun. That insecurity, combined with a new fear of foreign invasion, led him to expel and put to death any European missionaries in the land. However, he did not punish Japanese Christians, and tried to curry favor with certain samurai who identified as such, like Konishi Yukinaga. After Hideyoshi died, five of his retainers were appointed to rear his newborn son Hideyori to take his place, and rule in Hideyori's stead in the meantime. However, one of them, Tokugawa Ieyasu, began making a powerplay to take the regency for himself. (He had served Oda Nobunaga alongside Hideyoshi, and was narrowly beaten out of succeeding Nobunaga when Hideyoshi got to their lord's betrayer first.) Ieyasu divided the five elders, two against three, and took power for himself in one decisive battle at Sekigahara. For bringing an end to the unsanctioned Toyotomi rule, the emperor granted him the title of sh\u014dgun, and the Tokugawa shogunate began. Ieyasu had initially reversed Hideyoshi's policy and reopened Japan's ports to the Catholic Church. However, the aristocracy had learned of the Scriptural doctrine that one's loyalty to God should trump their loyalty to human authorities. Self-righteous revolutionaries took that message and twisted it into reason for insurrection, as in the Shimabara Rebellion. Ieyasu quickly became unwilling to tolerate this poorly understood, possibly dangerous set of ideologies, after having finally won his decades-long campaign for power. He therefore decided to persecute Christianity and anyone who professed it, be they Japanese and European. They had images of Christ called fumie sculpted, that they might compel Christians to stomp on to renounce their faith and avoid death. When this failed, captured Christians were tortured before being propositioned again. Refusal to apostatize the second time meant being martyred, sometimes in particularly agonizing ways. Ieyasu also closed almost all communication with the outside world, limiting trade with countries like Portugal and Holland to islands from which neither Japanese nor European could enter the mainland except on the pain of death. (Any Japanese that would shipwreck were also forbidden from washing up on their own land, on the same promise of execution.) Some professed Christians who were less strict about not trampling on their Lord had begun hiding evidence of their Catholic practices in their Shint\u014d and Buddhist paraphernalia, becoming kakure-Kirishitan (\"hiding\" + archaic word for \"Christian\"). These communities exist in small numbers today; and they have heavily syncretized Catholic, Shint\u014d, and Buddhist beliefs and ceremonies over the centuries. Aside from these arcane cults; the pardoning of Christians arrested in Sendai Prefecture by local daimy\u014d Date Masamune; and his believing retainer Hasekura Tsunenaga's continued evangelism in secret, there was no continued proselytizing in Japan for the remainder of the shogunate. When the emperor retook power in the mid-19th century, Christians stopped being persecuted, out of respect for his Western allies. (Emperors after did crack down on Buddhism and village-deity worship within Shint\u014d, having turned mainline Shint\u014d into a state religion with themselves at the center.) Religious freedom was only established in Japanese law with the MacArthur Constitution, named for the US general who oversaw the end of WWII; Japan's surrender; and America's occupation of Japan for decades after. However, Christian-identifying people currently make up a little less than 1% of the population of Japan\u2014well over a century after the first mission post-exclusionism. The biggest obstacles now to Japanese people's finding Christ would be secularism, and Shint\u014d-Buddhist tradition. ",

            "answer_text": "Buddhism didn\u2019t insist that Shinto rituals be abandoned when it was embraced. Instead, Cha\u2019n Buddhism entered Japan, combined with Shinto, and morphed into Zen. The Catholic strategy of allowing a few remnants of culture to persist may have worked with American Indians because Western civilization numerically overwhelmed the native cultures and religions, but Japan had many millions of people when the West first invaded and was far less likely to be assimilated by the West. At no point have Christian immigrants outnumbered Shinto natives as is the case with every indiginous culture in the USA. The West didn\u2019t assimilate Japan. Japan assimilated the West \u2014 at least within its own borders. In fact, with the rise of anime, arguably Japan is striking back, world-wide, in the cultural assimilation wars. ",
