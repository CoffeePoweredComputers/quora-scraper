            "answer_text": "All wars, ancient or modern, have been fought for some kind of territory in the sense of gaining or defending power over something. That something is usually land but can also be a political, religious or regal domain, a particular set of resources or even access rights to a domain. So if you look at the wars being fought right now you see this acted out: Syria: multi-way battle for political control over the whole country (Assad) versus various actors seeking to ensure control and security in their \u2018own\u2019 particualr regions of it (Kurds, Daesh, Syrian Free Army, etc). Iraq: ongoing struggle betwen Shia and other groups for political control over the country Yemen: Ditto between Irianan-backed Houthi and coalition forces backing former President Hadi International Terrorism: All these various conflicts either have their origins either in the struggles of people disposessed from their homelands or competing for \u2018territory\u2019 of the mind, their wish to impose their values over whole swathes of society. And what about cyber-war? These are struggles to impose control over cyber domains or to break into them: domains like financial services, industrial processes, national infrastructure, defence and security domains, and so on. And why have wars always been fought over territory? Because \u2018territory\u2019of any kind means power. You can seek to preserve or increase power in the first instance through persuasion (politics), or negotiation (diplomacy) and if those fail, by direct means (military force). Hence Carl von Clauswitz\u2019s observation that \u201cWar is the continuation of politics by other means.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Well firstly because the ownership of many areas of territory was disputed with old claims dating back to imperial conquests and dynastic wars between medieval states. Secondly because of local populations trying to secede and break away from the countries that ruled them. Thirdly because many nations were trying to secure extra wealth and resources and control of territory was often the most effective means to do that. When you think of it there are few resources out there actually more precious than land, not just for the practical things you can do with it but for what it means to people on a personal level as a part of their identity.
