            "answer_text": "YES, GANDHIJI IS A BRITISH AGENT In 1887, Mohandas Gandhi or Gandhiji began his training as a British Secret Service agent in the capital of the Empire. His cover was \"barrister\" or \"lawyer.\" The British were determined to retain the \"Jewel in the Crown\" at any cost and that necessitated saturating India with British trained spies. Lord Roberts of Kandahar (\"Mr. British Empire\") was stationed in India for most of his military career. He recruited Gandhi for training as a spy. Aristocratic admiral Edmond Slade provided the finances for Gandhi's training in London.His daughter Madeline fell \"madly in love\" with Gandhi!! In June 1891, his spy training completed, he sailed home to India. When he arrived home to Bombay, no adoring crowds greeted him because the Gandhi legend was not yet born: The voyage home was a sad one, and his homecoming even more dismal. The Bombay docks were bathed in a misting monsoon rain as he landed on July 5, 1891. Not even the reunion with Kasturbai and his family could lift the gloom\u2013or a growing \"sense of helplessness and fear.\" Within a few months of trying to start his own law practice in Rajkot, he confesses in his autobiography, \"I had serious doubts as to whether I should be able even to earn a living.\" (Herman, Gandhi & Churchill, p. 82). Gandhi need not have worried about his future as a \"lawyer\" because admiral Slade and the British Raj was committed to taking care of the financial needs of all of their spies!!  Gandhi fought for the British during the Boer War. Gandhi's propaganda press had preceded him and this time he was hailed as a hero of non-violence and civil rights for the oppressed. The legend of Gandhi was born and a Nobel prize winning poet named Rabindranath Tagore gave him the flattering title Mahatma or \"great soul.\" Madeline Slade followed in the footsteps of her \"intelligence officer\" father. According to her biography, she fell in love with Gandhi after a French writer named Romain Rolland called him \"another Christ\" and the greatest figure of the 20th century....Nothing could be further from the TRUTH, she met Gandhi while he was training in London.  Madeline traveled all the way to India to be with her hero Mahatma Gandhi. She called him \"Bapu\" (father in Gujerati) and he changed her name to Mirabehn, after Meera Bai, an Indian goddess. Madeline provided the funds from the Bank of England for Gandhi's passive resistance or satyagraha. In 1931, Gandhi left for Britain to discuss Indian \"independence.\" He was accompanied by his political adviser Mirabehn. Gandhi was treated like a celebrity during his stay in Britain. He visited the textile workers in Lancashire which manufactured most of the clothing worn in India. The financial stakes were enormous for Britain because India was a \"captive market\" and dumping ground for most of her manufactured goods. As expected, Gandhi played his part as a spy very well and he returned to India empty handed. As well as being a master of disguise, Gandhi had another unique talent for a spy: the ability to fast....Churchill loved the idea of fasting and non-violence because it would accomplish absolutely nothing to free India . . . except help his spy Gandhi to lose weight . . . and live longer. Gandhi went on several long fasts to keep the British in India. His emaciated homespun frame became an icon around the world. Subhas Chandra Bose was the real hero of Indian independence and the true FATHER of the Indian Republic. From the very beginning of his quest for Indian freedom from British oppression, he was mightily opposed by Gandhi . . . even to the stratagem of having him poisoned. In February 1938, Subhas Chandra Bose was elected President of the 51st session of the Indian National Congress. Under his leadership, a united India was on the road to true freedom. As Congress President, Bose worked tirelessly to lay the groundwork for Indian independence and unity: In January 1939, Mr. Bose was reelected to Congress for another year. Gandhi was highly displeased with the result of the election. After visiting him, Bose fell dangerously ill: Unable to get any cooperation from Gandhi, Bose resigned from the Presidency on April 29, 1939. This was a momentous moment for India, as World War II was about to erupt in Europe, and a chance for India to gain independence from Britain.Subhas Chandra Bose would never have agreed to the partition of India into warring factions. The partition of India caused a dreadful civil war between Hindus and Muslims. Gandhi's answer to the millions who were uprooted from their homes was to FAST. Jawaharlar Nehru worked with Gandhi for the partition of India and he was Prime Minister from 1947 to 1964. Muhammad Ali Jinnah was the first \"Muslim\" governor-general of the newly created nation of Pakistan. Both men trained as spies in Britain!! In 1947, India was partitioned and 2 hostile nations were created where one nation had existed for 4,000 years. The British divide and rule strategy was applied, with Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims divided along ethnic lines. After the partition in 1947, a further partition took place in 1971 with the creation of Bangladesh. More countries mean more wars and wasteful military expenditures which could be used to improve the lives of the people. British Secret Service agent Gandhi underwent pagan cremation on January 31, 1948. A memorial to the spot where he was cremated now exists at Raj Ghat. Subsequently, mighty man Mahatma Gandhi was canonized by most of the world's religions. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know whether there was a pact between british and gandhi. But it\u2019s for sure his activities served British interest more than Indian. His so called \u2018non violence\u2019 crippled contemporary revolution and he always became a barrier in front of real freedom fighters like Bhagat singh and Netaji Subhas Bose. Lot of people who could have been alike of Sukdev , Rajguru or Chandrasekhar azad were misled by him and wasted their time and energy in Gandhi s ashram spinning wheels and singing bhajans throughout there life. He always tried to stop freedom fighters like Bhagat singh and Netaji from their action. e.g he stopped Netaji from becoming Congress president in 1939 even after he won the election with huge margin. In 1922 when the non cooperation movement took pace and pose some real threat to British he withdrew that movement with some petty excuse. When Bhagat sings popularity was surpassing his popularity, MK gandhi tried to divert the mass attention by a overrated movement called Dandi march. If we see closely the whole India started a revolt with Bhagat singh and demanded for \u201cpurna swaraj\u201d, Gandhi to divert the attention bring a petty issue of salt tax which definitely helped British to suppress the real movement called by Bhagat singh. He was asking for dominion status which is equally bad as British raj where few white british would be replaced by brown sahibs and a puppet Indian government. British always seemed to love him and tend to give everything gandhi wanted (i.e fame, popularity , \u2018mahatma\u2019 status through media, sponsored his ashrams monetarily through then Indian industrialists) . So, we can say both had kind of unwritten mutual agreement to serve interests of each other. If someone don\u2019t agree with me some questions to answer: If \u2018Ahimsha\u2019 is so powerful, why don\u2019t you go to J&K and do anasan or spinning wheel to drive away terrorist?Did Gandhi himself believed in non violence? Then why did he urged Indians to fight and give life for british for both world war?Why did he promoted petty issues like salt tax when people of India were asking for purna swaraj with Bhagat singh?If Gandhi was a real threat for British, why british did not try to suppress him? Gandhi was not undercover like other freedom fighter like Bhagat singh, Chandrasekhar Azad, Surya sen or Netaji. British could have easily stop his funding and closed his Ashrams. But instead why they give front page coverage of Gandhi? Why british did not stop his dandi march by force (remember Jalianwallabag) ?Gandhi seems to be only \u201cfreedom fighter\u201d never faced any challenge from British.",
