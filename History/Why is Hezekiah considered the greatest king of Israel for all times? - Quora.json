            "answer_text": " King Hezekiah of Judah depicted in a 17th-century painting by an unknown artist in the choir of Sankta Maria kyrka in \u00c5hus, Sweden. Hezekiah is considered by the writers of the Bible to have been one of the best Kings of Judah in its entire history. According to Biblical accounts, he restored the damaged Temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem, honored the priests of Yahweh and the Levites, mounted a concerted campaign to abolish idolatrous practices throughout Judah, and centralized the worship of Yahweh in Jerusalem. He also resumed the importance of the Passover celebration and, through his efforts, made it once again a central part of the worship of Yahweh among Israelites no matter where they had been scattered. He is also known for his attempts to extricate Judah from Assyrian domination by attempting to oppose the Assyrian King Sennacherib by forging and alliance with Egypt in 701 B.C. Hezekiah of Judah, while somewhat hesitant to go up against the Assyrians, was under tremendous pressure from important members of his royal court to enter into open rebellion against Sennacherib. They argued to him that he had been victorious in earlier battles against the Philistines so why not against the Assyrians as well? Jerusalem had never been more secure thanks to new fortifications and now with a source of water having been secured within the city in the form of the Siloam tunnel that Hezekiah had built; and then there was military might of Egypt now at their disposal as Shebitku had expressed his willingness to join them in a security alliance. With a new and untried Assyrian monarch in power, now was the time to take back their freedom. But the prophet Isaiah opposed these war hawks and counseled Hezekiah not to openly confront Sennacherib as he did not trust the stability of Egyptian support that had also been promised before the last sieges of Jerusalem by Shalmaneser V and Sennacherib\u2019s father, Sargon II, and which never came. But Hezekiah\u2019s hand was forced when the Ekronites rebelled. A patriotic fervor and anti-Assyrian spirit was spreading all across the city-states of the west and Hezekiah was powerless to resist. He cut off all tribute payments to Assyria and was quickly joined by Tyre, Philistia, and the other surrounding vassal kingdoms; whether he wanted the role or not, Hezekiah was now cast as the leader of the insurrection. Obviously, Sennacherib could not allow this insult to go unpunished and personally led his armies to strike quickly at the leaders of this so-called alliance before they could unite their armies against him. He struck first at the cities of Phoenicia, ravaging its tributary cities and destroying any commerce into or out of Tyre. He then turned against Sidon and sacked it. King Luli of Tyre quickly realized Sennacherib\u2019s strategy and knew that Tyre would be next so he hastily took what he could and fled to safety in Cyprus after which Tyre immediately surrendered. Sennacherib quickly proceeded to turn Tyre into the capital of a new Assyrian province and immediately installed his own men into positions of power. The speed and mercilessness at which Sennacherib\u2019s army had made quick work of the Phoenicians instilled new fear into members of the anti-Assyrian alliance that had previously been eager to refuse paying tribute. Now many of these same city-states that had previously pledged their loyalty to the rebel alliance were sending ambassadors to Sennacherib, laden with gold, silver and other costly presents. Ambassadors arrived from Arvad, Byblos, Ashdod, Beth Ammon, Moab, Edom, and others all pledging their continued loyalty and tribute payments to Sennacherib and the Assyrian Empire if he just left them in peace. This was a heavy blow to the rebel alliance because now huge swaths of territory were left where neither supplies nor men could be drawn. But the members of the alliance that remained were generally steadfast in their resolve to oppose Assyria to the death. Next to face the fury of Sennacherib\u2019s army was the Philistine city of Ashkelon. In Ashkelon, a rebel by the name of Sidqa had usurped power from Sharru-Ludari, the son of a governor personally appointed by Tiglath-Pileser III. But Sidqa proved no match for Sennacherib\u2019s forces and was soon being carted off to an Assyrian prison in chains, or worse, and Sharru-Ludari was back in power. But Philistine resistance remained strong as Sennacherib was forced to expend precious time and resources to also take the cities of Beth Dagon, Joppa, Benebarqa, and Azuru. Now Sennacherib\u2019s attentions were turned to Ekron. But before he would be able to reach Ekron he would have to engage Egyptian forces moving north that were rendezvousing with a small contingent of troops from Melukhkhah (probably Ethiopia) and Judean troops from Hezekiah. Egyptian interests were at stake now and Shebitku was not about to stand by and let the Assyrians gain complete control over all of Syria and Canaan. If that were to happen, with those territories as a safe base of supplies and operations, the autonomy of Egypt itself would then be in jeopardy. Sennacherib\u2019s army halted the Egyptian advance at Altaku and engaged them in a bloody battle there and at the city of Eltekeh. When it was over it was Sennacherib that once again emerged victorious, supposedly capturing one of Shebitku\u2019s sons (likely the leader of the Egyptian forces) and the Melukhkhan general. The cities of Eltekeh and Timnah were then both taken and the road to Ekron was opened. Ekron itself would offer little resistance to Sennacherib\u2019s army and the city was taken. The rebel leaders who had deposed the Assyrian governor were captured and impaled on stakes outside the city and their followers deported. The Assyrian governor, who was still Hezekiah\u2019s prisoner in Jerusalem, would later be released unharmed and restored to power and for this reason alone Ekron itself would be spared. Sennacherib did not use his defeat of the Egyptian forces as an excuse to move on Egypt itself because of word of another potential rebellion developing in Babylon. But the assumed leader of THIS rebellion was Hezekiah and it was his ruin and the subjugation of Jerusalem that was always the real goal of this campaign. Until those goals were achieved Sennacherib\u2019s campaign against these rebels would not be fulfilled. Once that was accomplished, and he had fully subjugated all of Syria and Canaan and the developing rebellion in Babylon, then he could deal with meddlesome Egypt. Sennacherib\u2019s army then moved up from the plains of Philistia into Judea where, one by one, the fortified cities of Judah would be taken, reportedly 46 in all, and the path to Jerusalem was now clear. Convinced now that resistance was futile, Hezekiah sent an ambassador to seek Sennacherib\u2019s terms of surrender. The Assyrian King, knowing that he had the upper hand and that Hezekiah was terrified of what he might do next, responded by demanding an outrageous amount of tribute\u202630 talents of gold and 800 talents of silver, the equivalent of $38 million dollars in gold and another $16.5 million in silver at current prices. But even though this sum would be extremely difficult to raise, and would require every ounce of gold and silver to be stripped from the Temple of Yahweh, Hezekiah agreed and paid Sennacherib all that he asked. Sennacherib had been successful in every single military action he had conducted in this western campaign from the coastlands of Sidon, down to Ashkelon, defeating the Egyptian army at Eltekeh, and had successfully subjugated all of Syria and Canaan to Assyrian control. He had sent a clear message to all would be rebels in the west and to his greatest rival, Egypt, that opposition to the Assyrian Empire would not be tolerated and would be met with deadly force. Sennacherib would now return to Nineveh the conquering hero, laden with tons of gold and silver from tribute payments and captured loot, along with literally thousands of horses, farm animals, weapons, and other assorted plunder. But a few years later, after Sennacherib had put down a rebellion in Babylon and turned the city into a swamp, outrage over what he had done in Babylon precipitated revolts in Philistia to break out again against Assyrian appointed governors. Ekron again revolted and asserted its independence, refusing to pay tribute. Hezekiah of Judah also rediscovered his courage and joined the Ekronites in solidarity in refusing to pay tribute. Hezekiah then went so far as to provide aid and support to other Philistine rebellions against their Assyrian governors and moved to take back Judean territory from Assyrian appointed Philistine governors that it had been given to in Sennacherib\u2019s first campaign 14 years earlier. He even once again sought support from the new King of Egypt, Taharqa, the son of the first Nubian King of Egypt, Piye, who had succeeded his cousin Shebitku to the throne after his death in 690 B.C., just one year before the destruction of Babylon. And it would seem that Taharqa gladly agreed to ally with Hezekiah against any future Assyrian incursions as it likely had become crystal clear to him that Babylon was only the first to fall if nothing was done; that if Sennacherib was not stopped he would soon be at Egypt\u2019s door threatening to burn it to the ground just as he had done to Babylon. All of these leaders likely looked at what had been done to Babylon and realized that if they did not stand as one against Sennacherib then eventually they would share the same fate as the Babylonians, and deservedly so if they did not stand up against this evil. Furious over the actions of the western Kingdoms and the lack of respect he was receiving over his sacking of Babylon, Sennacherib was determined to make these rebels pay with their lives this time. This time around the lands of Palestine would not be able to buy their way out of death at his hands; this time no price would be high enough to avoid his vengeance; and this time there would be no risk of a Babylonian rebellion to pull him away. And so in 687 B.C. he gathered his army together again and prepared to march on Palestine for the second time. And when he had laid waste to Philistia and Judea and anyone else who opposed him in Palestine, Egypt would be next. Phoenicia was not an issue for Sennacherib this time as it was now securely in the hands of governors loyal only to him. This meant he could focus his anger on the rebels in Philistia and Judea. And this he did without mercy. He moved speedily into Philistia to take back Ekron. When he reached the Philistine city he was quick to demonstrate the fate that awaited anyone else that opposed him. In short order, he tore down the city walls, had his men plunder, pillage and murder anything and anyone within the city, impaled its leaders outside its fallen walls, and then set what was left on fire. From there he continued on a path of unrelenting destruction through the rest of Philistia. When he had destroyed all that he could find there he turned to Judea. City after fortified city in Judea would fall to Sennacherib\u2019s war machine as his only objective was to spread terror in all the inhabitants of the land. Next in his path was the fortress city of Lachish in Judea that was the last stronghold that prevented easy access to the road to Jerusalem. Sennacherib had prepared to take it on his previous campaign but had left it standing when he received word of renewed rebellion in Babylon. But now no such problem was standing in his way. Sennacherib\u2019s siege of Lachish was unrelenting and merciless. Ultimately the city was captured, its survivors taken into captivity and deported, and its leaders tortured and impaled outside the city gates. Once its walls fell, as with Babylon, Lachish was pillaged and put to the torch. Afterwards, the city would be abandoned and not resettled again until after the return from the Babylonian captivity decades later. Stone reliefs of the siege have been found in the remains of Sennacherib\u2019s palace in Nineveh that show the looting of the city, its defenders being thrown over the ramparts, impaled, having their throats cut, and begging for mercy. Once Lachish was taken there was no obstacle between the Assyrian army and Jerusalem and fear and panic must have gripped both Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem at the prospect that they too would soon meet the same fate as Ekron, Lachish and Babylon. Hezekiah most likely immediately sent out messengers to beg for support from Taharqa in Egypt, but even if he responded there might not now be enough time left before Sennacherib was at their doorstep. But Sennacherib had likely anticipated that Hezekiah would call for aid from Egypt and was prepared for this possibility. He set up a headquarters in Lachish and sent one of his chief officers, known as the \u201cRabshakeh\u201d (the royal vizier), to Jerusalem with a detachment of troops to demand Hezekiah\u2019s unconditional surrender. He would remain in Lachish and prepare for the arrival of Taharqa and the Egyptian army. Sennacherib\u2019s strategy appears to have been to have his Vizier, set up a blockade around Jerusalem to prevent anything going in or out of the city and to instill as much fear in the populace as possible. His Vizier, or Rabshakeh, would then begin a psychological campaign to attempt to demoralize the inhabitants of the city and get them to overthrow Hezekiah and surrender without a fight. He would shout over the walls to anyone that could hear that Hezekiah was lying to them, that their God Yahweh could not deliver them from the hands of the great King Sennacherib, and that no Egyptian help would be forthcoming. He even taunted and laughed at them for counting on the Egyptians at all and called them cowards for not coming out to meet them like men, even offering to supply them with arms if that\u2019s what it required to get them to come out and fight. But the people of Jerusalem remained loyal to Hezekiah and no revolt ensued. And Hezekiah continued to refuse to give up the city. It was also likely about this time that word reached Sennacherib that Taharqa had mobilized his troops to come to Hezekiah\u2019s aide. Thinking that this was now his chance to deliver a final killing blow to both Judah and Egypt, he pulled back the bulk of the forces he had sent to Jerusalem to the city of Libnah, a city just to the northwest of Lachish near the coastal area that Taharqa would likely have to travel in order to give aid to Jerusalem. He then stationed the majority of his forces there and led a detachment to the south toward Pelusium to engage Taharqa\u2019s forces there, feign weakness, and lure him to Libnah were the strongest part of his army was encamped in order to trap him. He then sent a message to Hezekiah again demanding his surrender or else he would burn Jerusalem to the ground just as he had done to Babylon, Lachish and Ekron.  Upon receiving this latest demand to surrender from Sennacherib (likely during the time of the annual Passover ritual), the Biblical account says that Hezekiah took it into the Temple of Yahweh and laid it out on the altar and prayed the following prayer: \u201cO Lord of hosts, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim, you are the God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth. Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear; open your eyes, O Lord, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God. Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands, and have cast their gods into the fire; For they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed. So now, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are the Lord.\u201dIsaiah 34:16-20 (English Standard Version) Little did Hezekiah realize, save only for his faith, that at that very moment the \u201cstars in their courses\u201d were about to answer his prayer and deliver him, and the entire Near Eastern world, from the tyranny of Sennacherib. According to the Biblical account, in the early spring of 686 B.C., supposedly in answer to Hezekiah\u2019s prayer for deliverance, Yahweh sent his \u201cAngel\u201d into the Assyrian camp at Libnah and decimated the Assyrian army, reportedly killing as many as 185,000 men in one night.  The Destruction of Sennacherib\u2019s Army, by Gustave Dore. The army of the Assyrian King Sennacherib was possibly destroyed by a comet, meteor impact or an electrical interaction with another planet. Image at File:101.Sennacherib's Army Is Destroyed.jpg What Sennacherib was failing to take into account was that we were now near the time of another close encounter with the orbit of the planet Mars. But this time was a bit different. This time it would be joined by a close encounter with the orbit of the planet Mercury as well that would cause a planetary wide \u201cshock\u201d that was felt and recorded around the world, not only in the Near East, but also in China, Mesoamerica, Polynesia and India. Again, I refer to Jno Cook\u2019s excellent analysis of the likely events: Let me recap the drama. Mercury was headed, I presume, outward bound from perihelion closer to the Sun, when its plasmasphere intersected Earth's plasmasphere. The Sun, Mercury, and Earth all lined up. This lineup had been avoided for a long time. Although Mars crossed Earth's orbit at the level of Earth, and thus came within Earth's plasmasphere, I suspect Mercury had always passed above Earth, clearing it by at least 300,000 miles, the size of Earth's plasmasphere. Mercury was whacked with a repulsive shock and shoved in the direction of the Sun. Since Mercury crossed Earth's orbit at the level of the Sun's equator, it may have been forced into a completely changed orbit -- with a zero inclination to the Sun's equator, which is its inclination today. Only the forward motion of its original orbit kept it from falling into the Sun. I have detailed that this event probably constituted the burning tower remembered throughout the world. American Indians recall that prairies and plains burned in the southwest. The Polynesians saw a rat. A few hours later Sennacherib's army met with disaster. If we go by Mercury's present orbit, which at aphelion is 51,000,000 miles from Earth, then it could be suggested that this was the separation when electrical contact was made. Mercury not only shocked Earth, but also may have changed the Earth's orbit some small amount, reducing it to 365.24 days -- the current value. Since this should have shown up in the Mesoamerican Tzolkin calendar, but did not, it would seem that the change made to Earth's orbit was limited to changing the shape (the eccentricity) of the orbit. This would not change the orbital period.  Mercury in 686 BC. The distance between Earth and Mercury was probably on the order of 50,000,000 miles, placing Mercury's aphelion at about 43,000,000 miles. Since antiquity there has been endless speculation as to what really happened, starting with Herodotus (5th century B.C.), who attributes it to mice. Josephus (first century A.D.), along with modern historians, suggested a plague. But Biblical and Egyptian sources plainly state that it was Ignis Coelis -- \"a blast of fire from the heavens.\" Such would be one of the effects of an electrical interaction with another planet. There are two independent records of this event from China. The following is quoted from the Bamboo Books: In the tenth year of the Emperor Kwei, \"... the five planets went out of their course. In the night, stars fell like rain. The earth shook.\" -- Annals of the Bamboo Books The Bamboo Books were found in China in a grave in A.D. 279. The Spring and Autumn Annals, compiled for the state of Lu by Confucius and completed about 480 B.C., reads almost identically, but does not recognize the Earth shock. \"In the seventh year of the Duke Chwang ... In summer, in the fourth month, on Sin-maou, at night, the regular stars were not visible. At midnight, there was a fall of stars like rain.-- James Legge, translator, The Ch'un Ts'ew and The Tso Chuen (1872) The seventh year of the Duke Chwang of Lu is identified as 686 B.C. by Legge. The quote from the Bamboo Books lists the date (-687) in astronomical notation, which is equivalent to 686 B.C., Julian. These terse Chinese historical notes, which have been dated to March 23, 686 B.C., can be interpreted as a swing of the spin axis of the Earth as it underwent a gyroscopic reaction to an external torque induced by the Earth's plasmasphere contact with the plasmasphere of another planet. The other planet, in this case, was Mercury -- not Mars, as every researcher expected. The first effect of the sudden electrical repulsive forces experienced from Mercury, as the plasmaspheres connected, was a shock felt worldwide. The stars would seem to fall, or, on the day side of Earth, the Sun would move away from its normal path. Sennacherib returned to Assyria, did not record this nighttime disaster (or the campaign) among his records, and spent the next 8 years in seclusion. Two of his sons kill him while he is at prayers. There was an Egyptian monument in the eastern Delta (at Letopolis, \"Mouse City,\" also known as the \"City of the Thunderbolt\") to a \"mouse god\" (per Herodotus), erected in commemoration (apparently) of the defeat of Sennacherib's army which had left Egypt in 686 B.C. (or never reached Egypt). There are also extant temple inscriptions bearing on this. I would suggest that it was Mercury which was involved in the incident of 686 B.C. Mercury is Hermes among the Greeks, but known as Smintheus or Apollo Smintheus (\"mouse god\") in Asia Minor at the time when Mercury was still known as Apollo, the Archer God, among the Greeks, as in the Iliad. The name Apollo is transferred to the Sun at a later date. Mercury, which is only a little larger than our Moon, certainly might have looked like a mouse with its plasma tail at a considerable distance from Earth, just as it might have looked like a bow and arrow with the bow shock and tail. Although the date, supposedly March 23, 687 B.C. (Julian), would seem to argue for Mars as the agent, a second Earth shock by Mars is not at all well supported. I would opt for Mercury as the agent, and I would place the event in 686 B.C. rather than 687 B.C. The Earth shock event was experienced at night in Peking and Jerusalem. Chinese sources read \"at night\" and \"at midnight,\" as does the Bible. Although Mercury was not seen during the daytime in Asia or the Middle East, it was seen by North American Indians in the daytime. To paraphrase from various legendary North American Indian sources, this is what transpired: The Sun was in the day sky a few hours before or after noon when it turned black and started to move down, that is, moving directly toward the horizon and additionally toward the southeast. The Sun was choking, and as it dipped down in the sky, the sky darkened and Coyote (Mars) was noticed in the east. Coyote had just crossed over the Earth's orbit in the last few days. Obviously Coyote had snared the Sun, and was dragging it backwards. Only after an hour did the Sun brighten again and return to its path across the sky. Then it was seen what had happened. A mouse had chewed through the lasso. It could still be seen just west of the Sun, with its tail pointing away. The tale of a mouse in the sky is known throughout the world in various forms, as De Santillana and Von Dechend point out in an appendix to \u201cHamlet's Mill\u201d. Some of these are not accurate for an involvement with the Sun, however. Most of the daylight during this incident spread only from far Western Europe to the middle of the Pacific. Thus tales of winged mouse Gods from India are suspect. The Polynesians have myths dealing with a rat God that gnawed through the nets of the Pleiades. Mercury was within a few degrees of the Pleiades on March 23, 686 B.C. This is correct if it is considered that at this time the dome of the stars had not yet shifted (that would happen in 685 B.C.) so that the Sun stood directly below the Pleiades at the spring equinox. When word reached Sennacherib in Pelusium of the destruction of his army back in Libnah he now realized he had to more than feign retreat as Taharqa\u2019s forces advanced upon him. Now he had to ACTUALLY retreat as his former strategic plan no longer held. Whether or not the Assyrian and Egyptian forces actually tangled with one another at Pelusium I cannot be sure, but what is known is that Sennacherib beat a hasty retreat back to Nineveh and never darkened the door of Palestine or threatened Egypt ever again; and Taharqa, whether or not a single blow was exchanged or not, was able to proclaim a victory over the seemingly invincible Assyrian army. The joy and celebration that must have broken out in Egypt, Judah, and the surrounding lands of Palestine at that moment must have known no bounds. To the Judeans, it was clear evidence of the power of Yahweh who had come to their aid in their hour of greatest need. For Taharqa it gave a stamp of success and power to his rule as the new King of Egypt and a much needed shot in the arm for Egyptian prestige across the region. Celebrations in Judah, however, would be short lived, as just a few weeks after the \u201cMiracle at Libnah\u201d King Hezekiah would die and be succeeded by his son, Manasseh, who he had made his co-regent 11 years earlier in 697 B.C. But all of the foregoing events solidified Hezekiah\u2019s position as one of the greatest Kings in the history of Judea. ",
