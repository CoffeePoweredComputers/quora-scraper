            "answer_text": "Yes. Very much. I am Serbian and I like to travel around the world and learn about new cultures and people. Until recently, I have lived in the UK for almost 6 years. Before that, I have spent couple of months in USA and I have lived in Greece some time. I am an artist and usually I am interested in literature, film and theatre. The British cultural heritage is the reason why I have moved to the UK. The first thing which I did after I have arrived in London, was to apply for volunteer positions in cultural institutions and I can say that this was one of the best decisions in my life. British people are very clever and creative, but the one thing which sets British culture apart from others is experimentation. They like to experiment with genres, with different approaches, with acting, with audience, with different styles etc.\u2026 When it comes to American culture, I must admit that they are best in expressing feelings, but also in telling a story in very simple and clear way. On the other hand, Greek culture is unique because they made important contributions to literature, philosophy, and theatre. I think that the cultures of these left a positive impact on me- studying Greek culture, I have deepened my knowledge; by getting to know British culture, I have learned not to be afraid of experimentation; and studying American culture, I have learned how to express my feelings understandably. When it comes to everyday life, I also allowed positive aspects from these cultures to affect me. For example, in London, I have learned about patience and queuing. In America, I have learned to be respectful and in Greece I have learned how to preserve culture and tradition. So, my answer is yes, I do value the history and culture of the countries I have lived in and they greatly contributed to my personal development and moral values. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly it is messed up i feel has if france always was a strange land to me (until i left) I never felt home there never identified to \u201cfrenchhood\u201d or the history of the country. I was rejected for my ethnicity but in a sense that was fine because i wasn\u2019t raised with this idea that i\u2019m french my parents never considered me has a french person neither society did. I don\u2019t identify to french history at all however traditional french culture is beautiful pastries and the food are delicious. Has i write these lines i feel like all these years i spent in france was just extented tourism nothing more or less. However what my parents did and i will always be grateful for it is that they taught me arabic and some tmazight, they also taught me how to be proud of my Islamic and morrocan identity and our historical figures Tarek ibn Ziyad, Fatima al fihriya, Idriss the first, the Almohads, the Almoravids etc\u2026 I\u2019m grateful because it helped me \u201cabsorb the chock\u201d of rejection by society It helped me to dissociate from french white society easier because it can be very cruel toward minorites especially the maghrebi community some people don\u2019t absorb the shock like they have to and instead suffer from internalized racism. They end up denying their roots and ethnicity completely and the thing is there is no one who is willing to talk about this subject french media is too caught up in it\u2019s ordinary racism and problematic views. However It did not bummed me out to the contrary it motivated me to go live elsewhere were i can feel trully free. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that the word you are really looking for is respect and not value. I respect the history and the cultures of the different peoples of the USA. I do not value it above my own history and culture because it is who I am, my identity. Does that mean I don\u2019t integrate? No, it means I behave like a well mannered guest in someone else\u2019s house. I respect them and their ways. I do not plan on abandoning my culture and am teaching my language and values to my children. We are a unique people, it would be a shame to give up what makes us unique to become what I see as generic. ",
