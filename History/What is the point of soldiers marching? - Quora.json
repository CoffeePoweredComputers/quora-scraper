            "answer_text": "There are actually a number of points or benefits that come from marching, also called drill or close order drill. Surprisingly, some of my fondest memories of attending Aviation Officer Candidate School revolve around the cadence and \u201cJody call\u201d while we aviation officer candidates marched in tight formation together. The benefits were many, and unexpected. Sure it helped our physical fitness, but it became a \u2018mind thing\u2019. It really built esprit de corps within our unit, all moving as one in unison without thinking and doing it with precision. It was Zen like and one could forget about all the other stresses and challenges of the school. For me it was an escape. I can still hear all those heavy black flight boots hitting the \u2018grinder\u2019 hard, in step and all in unison. We tried to make that loud as our Marine Drill Instructor yelled out the cadence. I remember getting my chance and being graded on drilling a unit of my peers. It was my best leadership grade and best of our battalion. The reasons were I liked drill, I was a former vocalist and had the pipes to call cadence, I paid attention earlier, and I was a bit lucky.  Here are more authoritative reasons for \u201csoldiers marching\u201d: What is the object of close order drill? The object of close order drill is to teach Marines by exercise to obey orders and to do so immediately in the correct way. Close order drill is one foundation of discipline and esprit de corps. Additionally, it is still one of the finest methods for developing confidence and troop leading abilities in our subordinate leaders. Close Order Drill Manual (Part I) From the Marine Manual: 3. Purpose of Drill. Commanders use drill to: Move units from one place to another in a standard, orderly manner.Provide simple formations from which combat formations may be readily assumed.Teach discipline by instilling habits of precision and automatic response to orders.Increase the confidence of junior officers and noncommissioned officers through the exercise of command, by the giving of proper commands, and by the control of drilling troops.Give troops an opportunity to handle individual weapons.4. Purpose of Formations To build unit cohesion and esprit de corps by recognizing Marines during awards and promotion ceremonies.To maintain continuous accountability and control of personnel.To provide frequent opportunities to observe the appearance and readiness of the uniforms, arms, and equipment of the individual Marine.To keep the individual Marine informed by providing the means to pass the word.To develop command presence in unit leaders.To instill and maintain high standards of military bearing and appearance in units and in the individual Marine. 1-3 1001 MARINE CORPS DRILL AND CEREMONIES MANUAL g.

            "answer_text": "At Valley Forge in 1778 the Continental Army under the Command of General George Washington was on the verge of collapse. Many of the men had no shoes, no coats, Hygiene conditions were as bad if not worse than Olongapo PI. The Army was in serious danger of falling apart. The French Minister of War recommended to Benjamin Franklin that the Americans employ a Prussian Soldier by the name of Baron von Steuben to train and build up the Army. Ben Franklin in turn passed the advice to George Washington. Von Steuben compiled a Drill Manual , known today as the Blue Book. Alexander Hamilton and Nathaiel Greene translated the book from French to Englkish. The Prussian techniques that Steuben shared in his book were much more progressive than other techniques employed by other European Armies. What the Drill methods taught was a efficient method of firing and reloading weapons in battle. Von Steuben began drilling the shoe less Bums tirelessly, until the movements became second nature. Von Steuben took Charge of establishing good order in the Camp, demanding that proper Latrine facillities be installed facing downhill and on the opposite side of the camp from the kitchen. His methods obtained immediate results, the camp was transformed as the men were transformed. He was named the first Inspector General of the Army and his methods were adopted throughout the Army. His Blue Book, now referred to as Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States, was distributed to all Commands and became the Standard for Military Training. Marching Troops is much more than just moving from point A to B.  ",
