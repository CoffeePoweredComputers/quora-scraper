            "answer_text": "For starters, The Great Depression brought a rapid rise in the crime rate as many unemployed workers resorted to petty theft to put food on the table. Suicide rates rose, as did reported cases of malnutrition. Prostitution was on the rise as desperate women sought ways to pay the bills. Health care, in general, was not a priority for many Americans, as visiting the doctor was reserved for only the direst of circumstances. Alcoholism increased with Americans seeking outlets for escape, compounded by the repeal of prohibition in 1933. Cigar smoking became too expensive, so many Americans switched to cheaper cigarettes. This longitudinal study examines the effects of the Great Depression on the social and psychological development of 81 white women and 39 white men from Berkeley, California, born around the turn of the century. Analyses showed that respondents who were classified as relatively wise in old age (in 1968/1969) were as likely to experience economic hardship during the Great Depression as those considered low on wisdom in their later years. The health effects of economic recessions and crises have been studied for decades (Katona, 1966; Dooley & Catalano, 1979; Marmot & Bell, 2009). Evidence suggests that recessions have detrimental effects on many health indicators (Abel-Smith, 1986; Catalano, 1991). Although those who become unemployed during a recession may have worse health compared with others, those who remain employed may also be affected through a loss of income, investments or job security (Brenner & Mooney, 1983; Carlisle, 2008). Given the adverse health consequences that accompany poor economic conditions, how economic recessions influence population mental health is of interest. Mass migrations continued throughout the 1930s. Rural New England and upstate New York lost many citizens seeking opportunity elsewhere. The great plains lost population to states such as California and Arizona. Since wisdom and psychological health are empirically and theoretically related, these results add support to the claim that wisdom may be acquired through the successful resolution of crises and hardship. It is unclear how the decline in the amount of recent research in this area may influence the current policy approaches to dealing with the impact of economic downturns on population mental health. Although many articles suggest limitations of existing research and provide suggestions for future research, there is relatively little discussion of policy approaches to address the negative impact of economic crises on mental health.

            "answer_text": "My parents both went through the Great Depression. It didn\u2019t affect them socially (they worked hard and had many friends). Some people who didn\u2019t have much food though, it did a number on them when it came to eating after they went through it. Some would overeat because they finally had more food, some would continue to eat the way they were raised. My Dad had to have meat, boiled potatoes and a vegetable every night. His snack was either saltines or very ripe bananas. It caused a lot of people to change when it was over, eating, not replacing things that could be fixed, reuse things like milk cartons, any thing that caused them to change their way of living. That would be the psychological changes. I can\u2019t believe that Ancestry is advertising to learn about their \u201cancestors\u201d who were in WW2. My Dad and Uncles all fought in WW2 and they\u2019re not my \u201cancestors.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": " I did not grow up in the Great Depression but my mother and father did. The psychological impact stayed with the their entire lives. My mother\u2019s family were farmers. She described how afraid they were about being able to survive, being able to put food on the table and clothes on their backs. Most, if not all, of their food was grown by them. Clothes were hand made. Christmas presents were something they could make themselves. She was later able to work her way through college as did my dad. They worked hard. They saved as much as they could. They had more at retirement than they could ever spend. But they would not or could not. They still lived in fear of being placed back in the situation they were as children. It never left. It dominated their thoughts. Any time I would talk about them spending money on a luxury, I would get the speech \u201c\u201cYou don\u2019t know what it was like in the Depression. You don\u2019t know what it was like to not know where your next meal was coming from..\u201d The Great Depression stayed with them until the day they died. ",
