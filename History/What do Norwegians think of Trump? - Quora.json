            "answer_text": "The following poll shows that roughly five percent of Norwegians think that Trump would do a great or good job as president. The poll was taken before the last election. There are other polls posted here after the election in the thread.  Progressive party supporters are likely to be a key demographic that supports trump, but there are others *. Carl I Hagen, the former leader of the populist Progressive Party said positive things about Trump\u2019s policies (immigration) and criticized the Norwegian government for painting both Putin and Trump in a negative light as it is important to maintain good relation with each country. (Video in Norwegian). The Progressive Party in the 2017 elections received slightly over fifteen percent of the vote and is a member of the current coalition government. The progressive party tends to attract some of the least educated members of Norwegian society, with only 10 percent holding a university degree. This party is part of a Pan-European trend for the right wing to switch from an anti-Israel stance to a pro-Israel one, and sentiment beginning or leaning towards an anti Muslim stance. There are many reasons for Norwegians not to be supportive of Trump that come to mind, here are a few, and there are probably many more. -Norwegians vote for a party not an individual and in most cases each party is drawn between ideological lines and has a clear political platform. -Norwegian voters are incredibly anal about what they expect from their politicians. Minor infractions of the law, minuscule abuses of power, or any slight dishonesty can derail a politicians career*. -Norwegians expect their leadership to have statesmanship qualities. -Most Norwegians would not accept a politician that degraded others. -Norwegians are generally down to earth people, the \u201cget rich or die trying\u201d mantra is quite rare here, its more like \u201cbe responsible and try to be a good person\u201d is a value which is much more common to aspire to. -Norwegians today are not particularly ambitious in business or their careers and traditionally are a bit sceptical of those who are, or for that matter often anyone who is an outlier or significantly different. Their ambitions tend to focus on quality of life, fitness, and accepted success here is winning in sports. -Norwegians tend to champion the underdog and fight for the everyday person as most Norwegians view themselves as everyday people. As opposed to America where often even the poor consider themselves millionaires on sabbatical, giving a key insight on why the poor often vote for parties that do not represent their interests. *Hans J\u00f8rgen Lysglimt Johansen, the leaders of \u201cThe Alliance Party\u201d in Norway is shown in the video advocating trump. His party received 3,311 votes in the last general election. It\u2019s not really worth mentioning this political party other than as an anecdote, but that is what makes Norway interesting, all the little details and their remembrance, rather than trying to white wash history. It\u2019s an example of an exaggeration I make about Norway\u2026the land of 5 million people, 5 million dialects, and 5 million opinions. **In Norway, historically, a politicians sex life was usually kept out of the limelight by the press. However, with the #metoo campaign this has changed, and is an important shift in my opinion as based on my observations sexual harassment in Norway is quite high considering it is supposed to be one of the most gender equal nations on earth. Sexual harassment or the \u201cgrab them by the\u2026\u201d mentality shown by foreign politicians has never been tolerated in Norway. :-) Norway in the context of global trends and a changing domestic political scene. Norwegian politics is ever changing and in some cases for the worse, it\u2019s unfortunate a country that has often stood out is starting to stand in the same trends impacting the rest of Europe, namely growth of the right wing. Europe as one of the last bastions of socialist ideas seems to be under pressure to rid themselves of such \u201cdemons\u201d in a post-post modern world where the last ideological stepping stones laid are a Clash of Civilizations and Francis Fukuyama\u2019s The End of History and the Last Man . As long as those stepping stones are viewed as the terminus of the current path of humanity by the economic and governance orthodoxies well, then erosion of the left is likely to continue. I have always held the Norwegian political system is high regard as a mechanism that usually supported the egalitarian values of the country. A few exceptions to this is the treatment of foster children as a systematic way of the state enforcing social control or neglecting to police early state run foster homes , the treatment of Norwegian commercial divers , and failing to properly recognize Norwegian Merchant Marine sailor\u2019s contributions in World War II. However, today some people in Norwegian government seem very similar to the type of people that would be put in office in the bible belt of the southern United States. One is the Minister of Immigration and Integration Sylvi Listhaug. Under her authority Norway is deporting Afghan refugees in violation of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is decidedly non Norwegian historically as usually Norway is a staunch defender of human rights and respects international law and the voice of the UN. In fact, often when Norwegians take a moral stand they sound like they believe they are speaking as a representative of the UN on behalf of humanity, they tend to be passionate about that sort of thing. The second is a State Secretary in the Department of Justice and Public Security, Torkil \u00c5mland. In 1994 when he was 24 wrote a book called \u201cReformation, God\u2019s plan for Norway\u201d. In the book he writes how the Devil has taken control of Norway and how homosexuality is a sin and abortion is murder. Granted, when I was 24, said a lot of things to which would not agree with any longer however, I would apologize for saying such things that violated my current worldviews and remove such a book from publication, Torkil has not done that. I am so embarrassed by this man it hurts to reveal he exists as a member of government in Norway to the English speaking world. Are you surprised that both Torkil and Sylvi are members of the Progessive Party? Musings needed for some levity and not to become depressed after writing the last couple of paragraphs. Would like to point out that it is highly unlikely that Norway is controlled by the devil. I don\u2019t have much evidence on this, but as Christopher Hitchens said \u201cassertions without evidence can be dismissed without evidence\u201d, but in this case lets take it to another level :-) The Norwegian black metal band Satyricon has sort of traded some of it\u2019s black metal legitimacy to appeal to a broader audience. However, Satyricon itself has not necessarily acknowledged that it may not be authentic as it once was, and in black metal circles that can be frowned upon. In order for the devil to be successful in controlling Norway he would likely need to have legitimacy with his core supporters. Personally, I like Satyricon\u2019s music but cannot take them too seriously as they are a bit of a parody of themselves, as the following video demonstrates.  On the other hand, the Swedish band Ghost (video shows their campy appeal) said \u201clet\u2019s pretend to be the greatest 70\u2019s band no one has ever heard of\u201d and they created the satanic and occult image as admittedly just that, an image along with a great deal of product placement and merchandising. They freely admit they are not actual satanists or occult members but its a fun genre for them. Now if that is not the exact sort of trick that Satan would play I don\u2019t know what is\u2026it falls in line with how the political technologists in Russia keep Putin in power. That is, Putin breaks the fourth wall and tells everyone exactly what he is doing and appeals (and supports) a broad range of political agendas but in the end holds on to the power. This is exactly the type of in-authentic authenticity post boomer generations require to believe. Perhaps Torkil should have written a book about Sweden being controlled by Satan, he could have been on to something\u2026:-)  ",

            "answer_text": "My brother-in-law is Norwegian. They uniformly detest Trump, which seems to be the pattern among Norwegians and most citizens of Western democracies. \u201cOslo-based newspaper Aftenposten reported Wednesday that the survey, conducted by public opinion research bureaur (sic) YouGov at the end of June, showed that fully 66 percent of Norwegians have an \u2018extremely unfavourable\u2019 impression of Trump. That compares to 51 percent who said they had an \u2018extremely unfavourable\u2019 impression of Putin, who leads Norway\u2019s large neighbour to the east. \u201cGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and new French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, topped the new rankings of which leaders Norwegians liked the most. Trump and Putin were at the bottom of that list. \u201cThe new survey is in line with another conducted by Pew Research Centre, which also shows a dive in confidence in the US President among 37 countries since Trump took over for Barack Obama in January. Only 22 percent of those questioned think Trump will make good decisions on international issues. That compared to 64 percent for Obama.\u201d (Norwegians dislike Donald Trump) \u201cAmong the foreign policy experts polled by Pew Research Center, nearly nine-in-ten (88%) say they lack confidence in Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs. A median of 76% among the European and North American publics agree. Nearly as many foreign policy experts describe Trump as \u2018dangerous.\u2019 A median of roughly seven-in-ten across the publics surveyed share this view. \u201cAcross Europe and North America, foreign policy experts express little confidence in the world leadership of U.S. President Donald Trump. Just 12% say they have a lot (1%) or some (11%) confidence in Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs. Among the 12 transatlantic publics surveyed, a median of 21% say the same.\u201d (Transatlantic Dialogues: In Europe and North America, Publics More Supportive Than Experts of Direct Democracy) It is interesting that Trump supporters blindly believed Obama had made America the laughing stock of the world and that America had lost respect under his presidency and were furious at him for it, even though it was a blatant lie perpetrated by the right, including FOX. Now that it is demonstrably true that it is, in fact, Donald Trump who has made us a \u201claughing stock\u201d, they shrug it off, \u201cScrew the world, who cares what the rest of the world thinks? MAGA.\u201d ",
