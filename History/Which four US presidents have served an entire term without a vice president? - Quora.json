            "answer_text": "None, but we have gone a total of 38 years without a Vice President. Over the past 220 years, the office of Vice President has been vacant 18 times for a total of 38 years and six months. For almost 40 years we did not have a Vice President. For over 17% of the entire history of the office, we got along fine without anyone filling the position, described by Vice President John Nance Garner as \u201cnot worth a bucket of warm piss.\u201d Polite journalists modified the quote to the more common \u201cbucket of warm spit,\u201d and Garner ridiculed their censorship. Why did we have so many vacancies? The office of President has only been vacant nine times. The office of the Vice President became vacant those nine times, plus an additional nine times when a Vice President died in office or resigned. Why did the office go so long unfilled? Eight times we have had a vacancy in the office of Vice President when the President died and the Vice President assumed the office as President. Once there was a vacancy when President Nixon resigned. Seven times there was a vacancy when the Vice President died while in office. Twice we had a vacancy when the Vice President resigned. One Vice President, John Calhoun, resigned in conflict with the President, the other, Spiro Agnew, was forced from office because of a scandal. Such vacancies are to be expected. What is not expected was that most of the time the vacancies would continue until the next election. Seven times, the vacancy lasted for more than three years. When William Henry Harrison, our ninth President, died in office in 1841, his Vice President, John Tyler, became President. At that time there was some debate as to the legitimacy of his ascension. Some felt that he was simply an interim President, not subject to the full authority of the office. Critics called him \u201cHis Accidency.\u201d Despite his critics, he assumed the office and served out the remainder of Harrison\u2019s term. However, the office of Vice President remained vacant for four years. When William R. King, the Vice President for Franklin Pierce, died April 18, 1853, the office was not filled until the next election in 1857. When Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865, his Vice President, Andrew Johnson, became President and the office remained vacant until the next election in 1869. The same pattern followed the death of Garfield in 1881, McKinley in 1901, Harding in 1923, Franklin Roosevelt in 1945, and even Kennedy in 1963. Yes, President Lyndon Johnson had no Vice President for over a year until after the next election in 1964. The vacancy following Lincoln\u2019s assassination is probably most unusual. When Lincoln died, rogue agents of the recently defeated Confederacy also targeted Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward in a coordinated attack on the leadership of the U.S. government. At such a time, one would have presumed that Andrew Johnson would wish to quickly appoint a new Vice President to avoid the risk of having a vacancy with no clear line of succession. Ironically, he became the first President to be impeached and fell one vote shy of being removed from office\u2014without a Vice President in place to succeed him. Another interesting detail about the Vice Presidents: two men served as Vice Presidents under two different Presidents. George Clinton served as Vice President from 1805 to 1809 under Jefferson, and continued under James Madison from 1809 to 1812 when Clinton became the first Vice President to die in office. While Clinton served as Vice President for two Presidents, both hailed from the same party, the Democratic-Republicans. After Clinton\u2019s death Madison filled the position about 10 months later by appointing Elbridge Gerry, who also died in office in 1814. After having two Vice Presidents die under him, James Madison chose to let the position remain vacant until the end of his term. John C. Calhoun also served as Vice President for two Presidents. He served from 1825 to 1829 under John Quincy Adams (Democratic-Republican) and then from 1829 to 1832 under Andrew Jackson (Democrat). He was the first Vice President to resign from office, resigning in 1832 protesting Jackson\u2019s economic policies. He resigned to advocate the notion of nullification and secession, ideas that contributed to the Civil War. Some could wonder if a disgruntled Vice President contributed to the political unrest that led to the Civil War\u2014hardly \u201ca bucket of warm piss.\u201d That pattern of not filling the office of Vice President until the next election was the norm from 1814 until the vacancy of Spiro Agnew in 1973, which was quickly filled with the appointment of Gerald Ford. Did you know that Vice President John Adams was sworn in nine days before our first President? So technically, for nine days, Adams was our national leader before George Washington became our first president. Did you know that Franklin Pierce\u2019s Vice President, William R. King was the only Vice President sworn in outside the U.S.? He took the oath of office on March 4, 1853 in Havana, Cuba. He died in office the following month. Fourteen Vice Presidents have moved on to become President. Eight became President when their predecessor died in office. One became President upon resignation of the President (Nixon). And five were elected President in their own right after having served as President. And only one of those was NOT elected immediately after serving as Vice President (Nixon). Only four Vice Presidents served a full eight years: John Adams, Richard Nixon, Dan Quayle and Richard Cheney. ",

            "answer_text": "No President of the United States has served a full four year term without a Vice President. A number have served remarkably long periods (Franklin Pierce for instance had a Vice President who was on his deathbed when inaugurated, lasting 45 or so days), or the entirety of their predecessor\u2019s term after ascending to the office themselves, without one. But there has never been an instance where a President started a four year term without a Vice President, and then went the duration of it without a Vice President. ",
