            "answer_text": "Lieutenant Colonel Robert Blair \"Paddy\" Mayne  \u201cThe base was shut down for the night. About 30 German and Italian airmen were eating, drinking, playing cards, and socializing in the wooden building that served as the officers\u2019 mess. Preoccupied as they were, the pilots were flabbergasted when the door shattered under the impact of a booted foot. Filling the entrance was the silhouette of a huge man in British uniform with a submachine gun jammed against his right hip. As he opened fire, screams of terror and pain filled the room. By the time the Tommy gun\u2019s drum of 50 rounds was empty, the room was splattered with blood and littered with dead and dying men. As suddenly as he had appeared, the massive enemy soldier was gone. He was Lieutenant Robert Blair \u201cPaddy\u201d Mayne of Britain\u2019s Special Air Service (SAS), and he was far from finished with Tamet.\u201d\u2026..Kelly Bell. From Wikipedia: \u201cLieutenant Colonel Robert Blair \"Paddy\" Mayne DSO & Three Bars (11 January 1915 \u2013 14 December 1955) was a British Army soldier from Newtownards, capped for Ireland and the British Lions at rugby union, lawyer, amateur boxer and a founding member of the Special Air Service(SAS). During the course of the Second World War he became one of the British Army's most highly decorated soldiers and by destroying 47 aircraft in a single action he may well have destroyed more German aircraft than the RAF's highest scoring ace.\u201d He got pissed at everybody and fought anyone, be they friend or foe, even fellow officers. His main hobby was drinking and fighting (combined). He killed far more men than Rambo, unlike Rambo, Paddy Mayne was real life. His war story is probably the greatest combat film that was never made. Commando Paddy Mayne: Ireland\u2019s Wolf of the Desert Paddy Mayne - Wikipedia ",

Jack Churchill This absolute mad lad is perhaps the most badass person in history, let alone just in WW2. This was the same guy that decided to play the bagpipes, before throwing a grenade and charging into battle[1].  Jack Churchill and his pipes In Molina, he infiltrated a german observation post and with just the help of one corporal, captured the entire observation post[2].  Molina And when he was left alone after an artillery shell killed everyone but him, he stood there gallantly alone, calmly playing \u2018Will Ye No Come Back Again\u2019[3]. Plus, he carried a longbow with him to battle and performed a kill with It[4].  Jack Churchill with his bow And he also carried a sword, which he used to engage with the Germans in hand-to-hand combat[5].  Jack Churchill with a sword If this isn\u2019t the pinnacle of being badass, I don\u2019t know what is.
