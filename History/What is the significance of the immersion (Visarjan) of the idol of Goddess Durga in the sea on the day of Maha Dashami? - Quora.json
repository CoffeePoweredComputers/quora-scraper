            "answer_text": "On Maha Dashami, a final Puja and the last Pushpanjali is offered to Devi Durga. All the 5 Gods and Goddesses have a kalash wrapped by a red cloth at their feet, which is fenced by a thread on four sides forming a square. This kalash is where the divinities are invoked and considered to be the prana of murti. The thread is fenced so that Devi does not leave us.  Durga Puja of my locality. Notice the kalash placed below each deity, wrapped in a red clothe and four sticks, stuck into clay are put up on four sides which aides the fencing of kalash by a thread. When the priest finally ends the last Puja, the Yajaman of the Puja is summoned. He or she has to give the permission so that Durga can go back to her home. It is because she is our daughter, she comes to her maika (maternal home) and she needs the permission of her father so that she can leave. We, as a community, are her parents. Thus, she calmly waits for the permission. After the Yajaman gives his consent, the priest then goes personally to each deity and snaps this thread that fences the kalash and shakes the murti a little, so that all the deities are awake and ready to leave. It is then Durga is granted the permission to leave her home. The woman come and wipe down her invisible tears by the betel leaves and offer sweets to her. They celebrate their womanhood by smearing each other with vermillion. They weep as she is taken outside the Puja-Mandapa and taken near a water body. Finally, she is immeresed into the water along with her children. As her murti dissolves into the water, she makes her way back to Kailasha. Her temporary image dissolves and loses its identity, just as our body at the time of death mixes back into nature and loses its identity. Yet the Goddess is permanent and so is our soul, which never loses its identity.  Thus the symbolic cycle, the hallmark of Hinduism, is reflected in this whole ceremony. She comes and we weep in joy. She rests and enjoys in our company, but then has to leave. Then we weep in sorrow. Yet we know that she'll be back the next year, and with this hope we do her farewell while our eyes inundate with tears. Everything is temporary and it will wither away. It is a very sorrowful moment to watch her go away, leaving behind the barren Mandapa. Even when the Vedic Yagnas are completed, all the bricks of Homa-Kunda are disrupted and abandoned. The very same idea of non-permanence of things is depicted in Visarjana. The only thing that remains permanent is our devotion to Durga. This cycle goes on and on. The grand festival teaches us the wisdom of life through its rituals.  Jai Maa Durga. ",
