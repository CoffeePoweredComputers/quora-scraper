            "answer_text": "The simple answer is that, as the other answers have suggested, not every soldier was on the front lines all the time. Most of the time your battalion would be rotated off of the front line, to the support echelons. After a month of front-line duty, your battalion would be rested. While you were actually at the front, the majority of your time would be spent keeping your head down and just holding the position; the enemy would be mostly doing the same. When there was no major offensive in progress, life in the trenches could be pretty mundane. The major threat to life and limb was taking part in the sporadic assaults which came along relatively infrequently. If you weren\u2019t on the front at that specific time, you were actually pretty safe. ",

But even on a quiet day due to artillery fire, snipers, raids etc it mounted to many hundreds. War is never a safe place.But trenches even with all the problems provided some safety. ",

Many served behind the lines, building roads, bringing in supplies etc. Keeping your head down was a good start, as was never volunteering for anything. Think it through, if fighting was a guaranteed death sentence, then no-one would fight.  ",
