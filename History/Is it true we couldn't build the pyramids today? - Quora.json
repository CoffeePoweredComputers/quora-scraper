            "answer_text": "Every modern engineer will tell you that it can be done and even to a better degree and that is just flat out false. Sure, there is the Las Vegas pyramid and the tallest skyscrapers in the modern world. All modern structures consist of forged steel metal and modern light concretes that don\u2019t weigh nearly as much as the largest stones in the Great Pyramid of Giza. Some of the foundational stones weigh over 80 tons and a few obelisks are 400-800 tons. The average outer casing stone weighed about 10 tons. Modern fast transportable cranes can only lift about 18 tons. The largest land crawling crane in the world, Liebherr LR 13000, can lift about 3,000 tons but cannot move very fast at all once lifting a huge payload. It would take days just to go a mile let alone the Quarries that the Egyptians used over 500 miles away. The closest achievement in modern times to transporting such rocks would be the creation of the Levitated Mass at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It required a large 196 wheeled custom transporter to carry a 340 ton boulder a little over 100 miles. This cost over $11 million dollars for one stone. To cut the stones today would require millions of dollars of diamond tipped equipment that would need to cut every stone after or before delivery every 36\u201358 hours in groups of about 472\u2013762 and put into place that same 36\u201358 hours; If we are to emulate the 20 years \u201cexperts\u201d assumed it took to build The Great Pyramid. To think that The Egyptians had small work groups of about 40\u201364 people working all at once that had to meet the end day quota of at least 315 stones is ridiculous. That is about 13 stones an hour cut and placed all with just copper tools. Today we couldn\u2019t even place and cut 3 stones/ hr on site without large amounts of water onsite and nonstop replacement of diamond tip blades 24/7 for 20 years.The biggest misconception about the Pyramids is that they are just stacked stones. The Great Pyramids are not relevant because of just the engineering and the materials used, but how the ancient Egyptian society was organized to achieve this in such a early socioeconomic climate of early mankind. They had to use massive slavery of over 100,000 people to carry out the work and lift over 2.3 million stones for just the Great Pyramid; calculated by modern computers. There were many groups that rotated around the clock non-stop for over 86 years consisting of a constant 30,000 slaves. That means that the entire body of workers had to be outnumbered by a constant ruling army or at least controlled for 86 years straight with constant numbers to supply the workforce because of all the people who died building all three pyramids. It is for this very fact we could not build them today. The Egyptian\u2019s didn\u2019t use currency during the construction of the great pyramids, or at least there is no proof they did until the Greco-Roman period. They used a massive distributed barter system using the widespread abundance of grains and fabrics that came from the Nile River. Our whole society today revolves around a fictitious fiat currency that has no real value other than what we give it, and that is our time and effort. We have too many labor laws and lack of funding to even begin to build the foundation of the Great Pyramids. The construction of the Pyramids, as they were, is impossible because of our evolution away from absolute rulers like the Pharaohs. Modern concrete and crushed building materials are not the same as solid granite rock cut into one stone.Replicating them as they are versus building a modified and more robust version is nowhere near the same amount of effort as the original ancient method.We could not build anything today that would last over 4,000 years like the Great Pyramid at that scale. Most steel metal, concrete, and glass would weather and rust.WE DON\u2019T HAVE THE MONEY AND ORGANIZATION TO BUILD THEM",

            "answer_text": "Yes. It may be true that we, modern people, could not build the pyramids today as efficiently, fast and durably as the ancient Egyptians did because we still don\u2019t have hard evidence as how exactly they did. Obviously the ancient Egyptians succeeded magnificently many times and their masterpieces are still standing 4500 years later. Of course modern people have better tools like diamond saws and electric machines and motor activated steel cranes and so forth, but better tools become useless if the methods are wrong. The famous 21st century built leaning tower in San Francisco is a perfect example. Many egyptologists and scholars claimed that ramps of all kinds (straight, zigzagging, circulating, etc) must have been used by the ancient Egyptians but at the same time admitted that the ramps make no sense as they must have been as big as the pyramids themselves or they covered the faces of the pyramids to the point there would be impossible to maintain the perfect triangular forms during the construction; let alone how could they dismantle the ramps of stone afterwards: ramps of sand sink everything before the workers can raise even one stone block. Based on my own research, findings and theory that I made, the answer would be NO if modern people as we are, reuse the same methods as the ancient Egyptians did. Now, look at the following photo that I discovered from the Japanese researcher named Yukinori Kawae\u2019s work. the photo shows one face of the top segment of the Khufu pyramid then the face is expanded stone course by stone course as shown below:  The link to the related photo is shown at the end of my answer. Did you see the marks of and escalator? If you don\u2019t then you can skip the rest of my answer. Based on my theory, the escalators were part of the ancient Egyptian architects\u2019 tools to hoist stone blocks safely and fast. And in addition to that, they had their own kinds of \u201cpulling motors\u201d to make the escalators work like our modern ones. I will develop later about these \u201cancient pulling motors\u201d. Here is a well known drawing of the portcullis chamber of the Khufu pyramid:  Most egyptologists tell you that must be a portcullis. It is curious to classify this structure as a portcullis knowing that middle-aged portcullises were made to be used many times a day and many days a year, and yet the portcullis of the Khufu pyramid is supposed to have been used only once after the funeral of the pharaoh! Based on my findings, the structure could not be a portcullis. Its role as an elevator makes more sense to me. It has parallel ropes that modern elevators have, it has room for a cabin to rise, and of course its counterweight mechanism to pull the cabin (that holds the stone block loading sledge) up. So, based on my findings, the ancient Egyptians did invent escalators and elevators long before modern people did (as we have wrongly claimed) to build their pyramids. That is not all. The ancient Egyptians did also invent a mechanism better than our modern cranes, and this mechanism is \u201cUsing Earth\u2019s gravity against itself\u201d. Giant trucks and cranes can raise or drag stone blocks of hundreds of tons, but surely they will never ne able to compete with the force of the Earth\u2019s gravity which is limitless. This mechanism is actually very simple: weight vs. counterweight like their beam scales. By making counterweight with skewers of stone disks, the ancient Egyptians could assemble and dismantle them at will and quickly between each pulling operation. Basically they just put the counterweight on one smooth, flat and rectilinear slope then on the other side of this slope an escalator as the photo above shows, a sledge with the stone block or slab in it. As the counterweight sledge rolls down the slope, the sled with the stone block to raise, rolls up. That\u2019s it. So where are these slopes: Well: all the descending passages of pyramids. They were perfectly made: smooth, flat and rectilinear and very long too. They are artifacts of the ancient Egyptians\u2019 pulling motors, if you will, based on my examinations and findings. Voila, you may see now what I saw. The ancient Egyptians invented escalators, elevators, anti-gravity pulling mechanism (at least 4 kinds of apparatuses based on my findings). With these inventions, I don\u2019t think that the ancient Egyptians needed giant ramps or modern cranes or electric motors to build such architectural masterpieces. If modern people replicate their methods, I believe that we can demonstrate how exactly the ancient Egyptians did. With one twist, our modern stone blocks will be cut identical thanks to modern cutting machine instead of unique like theirs as they did one at a time by hands. We may finish the construction faster with electric motors to pull faster. But that is all the thing we have as better.
