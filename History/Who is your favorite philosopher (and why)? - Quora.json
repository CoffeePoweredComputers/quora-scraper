            "answer_text": "Diogenes the dog!  Diogenes is probably the greatest person to ever live, a living meme prophet of kek before the internet existed. Diogenes showed how absurd and arbitrary society and rules of how to live a good life are. He lives with extreme frugality in a barrel but he doesn\u2019t kneel to any emperor or king. Alexander the great once announced his presence before Diogenes and claiming to the greatest emperor and conqueror ever, offered Diogenes one wish, what did he say? \u201cStep out of my sunlight\u201d Then, Alexander said to him \u201cIf I were not Alexander, I would wish to be diogenes\u201d and to reply to this kind statement Diogenes Said \u201cIf I were not Diogenes, I would also wish to be Diogenes\u201d Once, Diogenes invaded Plato\u2019s school of philosophy and listened to a lecture. Plato was talking about how a cup exists on a table but the ideal cup, the essence, the \u201ccupyness\u201d is not there. Diogenes asked where this cupyness was and Plato pointed to his skull and told him that it was in the intellect and Diogenes couldn\u2019t see it because he wasn\u2019t enlightened enough. So Diogenes asked where is the essence of emptiness, where is the emptiness of emptiness? And Plato secluded to think about this problem for week after week. After quite a while, Diogenes comes back to Plato\u2019s school and Plato is completely dumbfouned and asked Diogenes where the emptiness of emptiness is. Diogenes the dog, this poor man living in a barrel before the elite and respected Plato did the following: \u201cThere is the emptiness of emptiness\u201d and he pointed at Plato\u2019s forehead.  THE SICKEST ROASTLORD OF ANCIENT GREECE! Diogenes had a slave when he arrived in Athens, who quickly ran away. People offered to buy him a new one or hunt down his slave but he simply said \u201cIf a slave doesn\u2019t need Diogenes(master) then Diogenes doesn\u2019t need a slave\u201d as a critique of society\u2019s policy on slavery showing that masters being dependent on slaves disproves their own claims to superiority. So sure, he did a lot of very 18+ things in public, like masturbate(he told the court when he was on trial that if he could cure hunger by rubbing his belly, he\u2019d do it, he was deemed innocent), but ultimately, Diogenes refutes the sensitivities and presumptions of wider society and more remembered philosophers like Plato. By not caring about anything, even with no possessions, Diogenes shows that he is wealthier than others by way of internal consistency and virtue of frugality. Kinda like how the popular kids are cool because they don\u2019t try hard. As a final tale before I go, Diogenes walked the streets of Athens with an oil lamp lit during broad daylight. After a few days time, people wondered what the hell he was doing, what was the genius Diogenes up to this time? So a passerby asked him \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m looking for an honest man\u201d that\u2019s fudging savage. Did he find an honest man? No he didn\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "Favourite? Interesting choice of words. I am going to interpret that as meaning the philosopher who I enjoy reading about the most, not the philosopher whose ideas I actually agree with. In which case, there can be only one answer, I present to you:  Diogenes. His philosophy was pretty simple by comparison to other famous philosophers; he believed society and civilisation to be regressive instead, seeking to live in a more natural state free from the shackles of society. Dogs, on the other hand, he praised greatly believing that their attitude by life by which they live in the moment, never worry and, simply do what pleases were the basis of how one should act. He basically spent his life trying to mimic this dog-like attitude to life while also mocking greatly the so-called \u201cgreat philosophers\u201d that he viewed to be at the core of this regressive society. That may not sound all that extreme, a lot of people believe that we should live more \u201cnatural\u201d lives, what makes him so fascinating to read about is quite how far he took these views. Let\u2019s look at some stories and habits from his life: \u03ba\u03c5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2He was throughout his life referred to as a \u03ba\u03c5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (kynikos), the word from which we derive \u201ccynic\u201d. The Greek, however, does not mean \u201ccynic\u201d in the modern sense, instead, meaning \u201cdog-like\u201d. Instead of being insulted by this nickname, he instead adopted it voluntarily and, when asked why he was described as such, he just responded that it was because he: \u201cFawns upon those who give him anything and barks at those who give him nothing.\u201d I bet you can\u2019t name another great philosopher who took pride in being called dog-like. Plato\u2019s ManHe lived at the same time as the famous philosopher Plato, who he spent a lot of his life ridiculing. The most famous case of this was while Plato was attempting to define a man, he came up with the definition that a man was a featherless-biped. On hearing this, Diogenes found a chicken, plucked out all its feathers and then ran into Plato\u2019s school holding it while proclaiming \u201cBehold, Plato\u2019s man\u201d. Meeting Alexander the GreatAlexander was greatly interested in philosophy and was a great fan of Diogenes. Upon visiting Diogenes, he was excited to see him and asked if there was any favour at all that Diogenes asked of him. In response, Diogenes, when offered a favour from among the most powerful men alive, replied: \"Yes, step away. You\u2019re blocking my sunlight.\" Impressed by this Alexander famously said: \"If I were not Alexander, then I should wish to be Diogenes.\" To which Diogenes responded: \"If I were not Diogenes, I too would wish to be Diogenes,\u201d Living ConditionsDiogenes spent many years living in a ceramic vase on the streets (entirely by choice) possessing nought but some clothes and one wooden bowl. He reportedly then broke this bowl upon seeing a servant boy drink from his hands proclaiming: \"Fool that I am, to have been carrying superfluous baggage all this time!\u201d Henceforth he drank from his hands. Searching for an Honest ManHe would also on regular occasion walk around in broad daylight carrying a lamp and go around looking through crowds and when asked what he was doing, he would proclaim that he was looking for an honest man but unfortunately could not find one.  ~~~ Diogenes searching for an honest man ~~~ Public IndecencyMany complained about his actions as he was frequently known to: \u2014Eat in the marketplace \u2014Defecate in the theatre \u2014Urinate on people who insulted him \u2014Masturbate in public A story upon similar lines states that, when someone took him into a magnificent house and warned him not to spit on anything, he promptly spat straight into the man\u2019s face claiming he could see nowhere else to spit. BurialWhen asked how he wanted his remains to be treated after death he requested that he be thrown over the city walls as long as he was given a stick with which to fend off animals. When it was pointed out that he would not be able to use this seeing as he would be\u2026 well, dead, he responded by asking why then he should care what happens to him as he would already be dead.  Although he certainly wasn\u2019t as influential as many other philosophers and never wrote any books or taught classes, there are no other philosophers as entertaining to read about. ",
