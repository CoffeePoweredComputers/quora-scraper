            "answer_text": "What are some major events that were overshadowed by another major event in history? There is no question that one of the biggest events of the past 50 years occurred on September 11, 2001. Every American remembers exactly where they were that Tuesday at 9:02 a.m. and 57 seconds Eastern Daylight Saving Time, the moment United Flight 175 was flown into the South Tower of the World Trade Center by terrorists. It was the second crash that morning, and signified the instant that we all realized this wasn\u2019t accidental. It was a moment the world changed forever.  I had personally visited the South Tower many times, as recently as one month earlier, so it was shocking and personal. Days later, while still trying to process the disaster, I realized something. On September 11, we all remember that American Flight 77 from Washington Dulles to Los Angeles had been intentionally crashed into the Pentagon, killing 189 people. That tragedy was just a piece of the horrific puzzle unfolding on September 11, but the story was understandably overshadowed by the two crashes at the World Trade Center. In fact, while we were still processing the newest reports on the crash at the Pentagon, only 21 minutes later the South Tower collapsed, taking center stage in our minds again.  When I looked back days later, I realized the crash at the Pentagon was the fifth-deadliest airline disaster on American soil, and still is today. I mentioned to several friends that it must be a horrible day when one of the worst plane crashes in your country\u2019s history is NOT the top news story of the day. Many have agreed with me that this grim statistic makes you realize the magnitude of September 11, 2001. Shockingly, two months later the crash of American Flight 587 also disappeared in history. Only 62 days after September 11, this American flight crashed in New York while taking off from JFK Airport, killing 265 people. It is still the third-deadliest crash in American history. American Airlines had lost an unprecedented three planes in 63 calendar days! But when it happened, and once it was proven not to be terrorism, our thoughts quickly returned to the World Trade Center. I remember it, New Yorkers remember it, most people do not.  Many of us have forgotten this crash. I think we were all numb to it by that point. A crash today killing 265 people would be a horribly tragic and enormous news story! In the end, the U.S. military found the mastermind of the September 11th attacks at GPS coordinates 34.169171, 73.242499, a compound in Bilal Town, Pakistan. Osama bin Laden had boldly planned the horrific hijackings from far away, only to be found on the third floor cowardly hiding behind some women when he was promptly shot and killed. Note: I am no longer accepting comments from Quorans who believe that terrorists killing unarmed civilians and children is an act of bravery. ",

            "answer_text": "The Bath School Disaster. On May 18, 1927 Andrew Kehoe went into the small town of Bath, Michigan to greet the schoolkids as they got off of the bus. He greeted each one saying \u201cToday\u2019s your last day.\u201d (It was the last day of school, so nobody thought anything about it.) At 8:45 half of the school building was blown up.  The Bath school May 18, 1927 Kehoe was an electrician who owned a farm just outside town. His farm was being foreclosed on and he was angry about that and the higher taxes he was paying that were used to build the school. He started placing dynamite in the basement of the school months before the school year ended to get his revenge on the Bath community. He killed his wife a day or two before the 18th, then on the morning of the 18th set his house and barn on fire after tying the legs of his livestock together with wire. As neighbors ran to put the fire out, he drove into town to watch the school blow up.  All that was left of Kehoe\u2019s house was the chimney As rescuers rushed to the school to try to save the children, Kehoe called to the superintendent, who went over to talk to Kehoe. After a brief argument, Kehoe blew his truck up, killing the superintendent, himself, the postmaster, a farmer, and another child who had survived the original blast.  The remains of Kehoe\u2019s truck. Rescuers stopped their efforts when more dynamite was found packed in between the floor joists in the basement. It turns out that faulty wiring saved the lives of many school children. Forty-five people died because of his actions, including his wife and 38 school children. It\u2019s the deadliest attack on a school in American history, yet it is largely forgotten. Two days after the bombing, this plane took off from Roosevelt Field on an historic flight across the Atlantic:  Lindbergh filled the headlines and the Bath School Disaster faded from memory. ",
