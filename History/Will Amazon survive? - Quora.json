            "answer_text": "The biggest worry for Amazon investors \u2014 beyond the question of whether Bezos is lining up a successor who can better manage the company \u2014 is the slowdown in its AWS business which accounts for 13% of revenues and 57% of operating income, according to Amazon\u2019s second quarter earnings release. Unless Amazon has a similarly fast-growing and profitable business coming along, rivals and more demanding customer expectations could imperil the profits needed to sustain the 20% or higher growth that makes Amazon\u2019s shares attractive to investors. As customers realize that it\u2019s risky to put all their eggs in the AWS basket, they\u2019re spreading their computing around. The beneficiaries of this diversification are Microsoft and Google, the so-called Hybrid Cloud in which companies keep some of their IT resources in-house, and focused upstarts that offer a better deal on one or two of the over 100 services that AWS provides. AWS is like the referenced Hotel California of The Eagles fame \u2014 you can check in any time you like but it\u2019s expensive to leave. As David Friend, CEO of cloud storage service provider, Wasabi, explained in a July 26 interview, \u201cCustomers are wary of having all their eggs in one basket. Amazon\u2019s pricing and policies promote \u2018vendor lock-in\u2019 and customers are just figuring out how little leverage they have with Amazon. An example is the fees that Amazon charges for taking data out of Amazon storage. It\u2019s free to put data in, but they charge hefty fees to take data out.\u201d Friend is not worried about AWS\u2019s future. \u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic to think that anything is \u2018broken\u2019 at Amazon and that their strategy or execution is flawed in any serious way,\u201d he said. With Amazon\u2019s businesses so diffused, it remains to be seen whether it will be able to keep fending off the competitive incursions to AWS from Microsoft, Google, and more focused upstarts. But I don't see Amazon having any serious problems anytime soon. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s impossible to know for sure about the longevity of a company. With that being said, Amazon has been doing remarkably well. In 2017, Amazon experienced a 30.8% increase from revenue compared to 2016, and these numbers keep going up. In 2018, it was announced that Amazon\u2019s share of the eCommerce market was 49%, or 5% of all retail spend. Those are remarkable numbers, and it\u2019s not just about numbers, either: Amazon\u2019s name is on the tip of everyone\u2019s tongue. They\u2019ve risen not only as an eCommerce giant, but also as a symbol for the new age of buying and selling, and, to some extent, the new age of the Internet. A lot can be said about Amazon, and possibly more can be said about what it represents. There seems to be some vested interest from the public about Amazon\u2019s future \u2014 will it fail miserable? Will it overtake everyone and everything else? The answer is very simple: everything is finite. That\u2019s a fact, and not an opinion. Companies have climbed to the top of the ladder and tumbled down. Companies have climbed to the middle of the ladder and slowly stepped down over the years. I think Amazon will be around for a good while, because I haven\u2019t seen any evidence otherwise. Nothing happens overnight, and the truth is that Amazon has experienced continuous success that has yet to be seriously abated.
