            "answer_text": "Read Armenian National Hero Andranik Pasha's life story. Does it seem \u201dloyal\u201d to you? Taken from an Armenian source, without changing a single word: GENERAL ANDRANIK'S LIFE: \"The first name in the Armenian struggle for national liberation in modern times is Andranik. \"Like an eagle he soars over the mountains and ridges.\" Andranik Toros Ozanian was born in historic Shabin-Karahisar (\"Shabin, the black fortress,\" 80 miles northeast of Erzurum). He was destined more, perhaps, than any of the other Armenian revolutionaries, to provide leadership, rationality, acumen, prudence, and effectiveness to Armenia's rising up against the brutal Ottoman oppression. Even during his adolescence Andranik recognized the pattern of Ottoman oppression and the sufferings of his people. So it was that at the tender age of 22, having lost his wife and two children, Andranik joined a partisan group formed in his native town. Inspired with the ideals of liberation for his people, Andranik went to Constantinople to meet those who had already been deeply involved in the liberation movement. He readily accepted tasks assigned to him. When the leader, Serob Aghbiur, of a fighting group which Andranik had joined, was killed, Andranik was named leader. It was in 1901 when his fighting group held out in the Arakelots Vank against an overwhelmingly superior force that Andranik's name became famous for his effectiveness as a revolutionary leader. There were many more similar occurrences to come. Andranik, at first, joined the Hunchak party; it was through party organization that he could be effective in securing men and materiel with which to carry on. But disagreement with party policies led Andranik to leave the Hunchak ranks and join the Dashnak party. There too, when that party engaged in practices judged to be wrong in principle, Andranik resigned. During the period 1907-13 Andranik committed his energies to helping the Bulgarian liberation movement. In it he created an Armenian division, which brought honor to itself by its effective participation. For his efforts Andranik was decorated and commissioned an officer. With World War I under way (1914-1918) Andranik went to the Caucasus and assisted in organizing Armenian battle units to fight the Turks alongside the Russian army units. In 1915 Andranik was named commander of all Armenian volunteer units within the Russian army.The overthrow of the Tsarist regime in Russia (1917) and the consequent collapse of the Russian imperial army found Andranik on the side of the working class out of which the social revolution in Russia had arisen. Early in 1918 he began to organize a separate army to liberate western Armenia. Made a Major General, Andranik had many thousands under his command, Armenian soldiers from the old Russian army, and many thousand Armenians who had volunteered from all over the world. However, short on re-sources and back-up military fighting units, Andranik had to abandon his plan to take Erzurum. With the collapse of the Tsarist Russian government an independent Armenian Republic was set up in May 1918. Andranik was in sympathy with the social principles that came with the new Russian order and desired to maintain amicable relations with Russia. However, Armenia's ruling party, the Dashnaks, did not favor such a relationship. As a result Andranik once again had a falling out with them. The brilliant defense of Zangezur (1918-19) under Andranik's command marked the end of his military career\" (Andranik Toros Ozanian Andranic Antranik pasha) ",

            "answer_text": "Quite simply, the Ottomanists, who desired the creation of a modern Ottoman Empire with numerous different ethnicities and religions, were replaced by the Young Turks and specifically the Committee for Union and Progress (CUP) which had a much more narrow vision of Ottoman identity as being restricted to Muslims and with a privilege vesting in Turkish-speaking Muslims. It was the failure by the Ottoman Sultans of the 1860s and 1870s to extend true equality to the petitioning Armenians and Assyrians and the subsequent attempts to use the military to quiet dissent that led to the escalation of tensions between the Ottoman leadership and its Christian minorities. Of course, the actual genocide was perpetrated by the CUP Triumvirate of Ismail Enver Pasha, Mehmet Talat Pasha, and Ahmet Djemal Pasha. However, I believe that from the moment that the Turks showed in the Hamidian Massacres that their only solution to ethnic and religious minorities\u2019 requests for equality would be met with a sword was the day when Armenians no longer had a future in their ancestral homeland, unless they could push the Ottomans out either by their own hand and/or with the help of a third party like Russia. The moment that the CUP believed that it could remove the Armenians, Assyrians, and other Christian minorities from Anatolia, and, therefore, decisively end the Christian presence in the East, they did so. These acts of wholesale ethnic cleansing and slaughter are known as the Armenian, Pontic Greek, and Assyrian Genocides of 1915\u20131918. Concerning the Deterioration of the Armenian-Turkish Relationship The Armenians were known in the 19th Century as Millet-i Sad\u0131ka or the \u201cHonest/Loyal Nation\u201d meaning that they were the minority most loyal and most tethered to the Ottoman State. The Assyrians also had a Millet and were in good standing with the Ottomans through most of the 19th century. This was in contrast to the Orthodox Millet whose members (the Serbians, Greeks, and Bulgarians) were declaring independence and revolting against the Ottoman Empire. This was causing a great strain on the Ottoman Empire in retaining its other territories. At this time, in the 1860s and 1870s, Armenians began to push for equal rights and civil reforms. There were government and local abuses against the Armenians such as: land thefts, intermittent Muslim-led murders (usually performed by Kurds or Circassians), unequal taxes, and banning Christian witnesses in trials. The Armenians pleaded to the Ottoman authorities for a reprieve, but the Ottoman government ignored them, squandering an opportunity to maintain the Empire. Armenian Resistance to Turkish Atrocities Accordingly, the Armenians began to consider a more radical solution, the same independence that had happened in the Balkans. This was when the Dashnaktsutyun or Armenian Revolutionary Front was formed in 1890. It did not have large scale support among Armenians within the Empire and had to go to Iran, and later Russia, to get funding and manpower. The Armenians of the Empire remained loyal and disavowed the Dashnaks, but petitioned for their equality as Ottoman subjects, equality with the privileged Muslim citizens. However, as the situation was increasingly seen as hopeless by the Armenians after 30 years of non-action by Ottoman leaders, Armenian leaders within the Empire peacefully petitioned for increased autonomy while still sitting within the Ottoman Empire, led the by at-the-time-peaceful Hunchak Political Party. Rather than granting equality or autonomy, the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Abdul Hamid II, decided that he would launch a series of massacres against what he believed to be an Armenian conspiracy in cahoots with foreign powers to destroy the Ottoman Empire. He sent soldiers to persecute the Armenians in 1894, which gave the Dashnaks the opportunity to represent themselves as the defenders of the Armenian People in the Empire. This came to a head in the Sasoun Rebellion of 1894 in which the Dashnaks and Hunchaks gloriously defended Armenians from Abdul Hamid II\u2019s belligerence. Abdul Hamid II responded to this supposed insubordination with the Hamidian Massacres of 1894\u20131896, in which it is estimated that Ottoman soldiers and Hamdiye irregulars slaughtered 200,000 Armenians and 25,000 Assyrians, mostly civilians. The only resistance to this horror were the now-armed Hunchaks and the Dashnaks. The Assyrians did not even raise a hand as their brothers and sisters fell from Hamdiye blades. The Cast Die As increased amounts of repression continued, the Dashnaks, Hunchaks, and the significantly more powerful Ottoman Regime came into more conflict. The Dashnaks were responsible for a number of small civilian massacres of Turks, such as those in the Armenian-Tatar Massacres in the Russian-controlled Caucasus. Far more massive (by over 100 times) were the Turkish responses where the entire Armenian population was targeted. The most notorious of these before the Armenian Genocide was the Adana Massacre of 1909 in which around 20,000 Armenians were killed, civilians and militants alike. As the Young Turks, a political party that saw Muslim identity as part and parcel of the future of the Empire, ascended to power, the situation successively worsened for the Armenians of the Empire. It became inevitable that they would seek to resolve the \u201cArmenian Question\u201d through a thorough ethnic cleansing and genocide. ",
