            "answer_text": "From the books and material I've read I would have to say no, but they could have been perceived as such. In a nutshell, they took on and solved problems of the present while also recognizing the need to have plans for the future which would really benefit the whole. They were maticoulus record keepers and planners which could be considered threatening to people who believe to hold higher status. They were devoted to their cause and that was to fight for god, be on his side over man. They recognized that people need to be protected and helped while also recognizing that either that person or their land or property could be put to use in order to benefit others. One instance for example was when a man on his boat drowned in the Thames (which the templars had legal jurisdiction of) they seized his boat. Obviously the boat owner no longer needed the boat as he was dead though the boat itself was valuable at around 14 silver at the time. The boat itself or the materials or coin would be handy in the future for their cause though some people would likely look at this negatively. They rescued one person from a brawl, gave him clothes and food for life and later utilized him as a lawyer, one who actually worked on their behalf during their trial which obviously didn't go over very well. They'd often do this, in giving people a place to eat for free ever day along with clothes regardless of who they were or what they did. They had a unique way of looking at the world and the life it had. They also felt they had a greater purpose and this threatened a lot of people then as it would today given how people amongst society work and so they would be viewed negatively. People can't see past themselves and so everything else is a threat. They were aware of this mindset and eventually planned for the day they would be judged. When you really think about it, they did more for the people than any earl, king or queen so they defiantly were not bad at all. They had a higher purpose which really was knowledge and helping others which was twisted into a vision of a psychopathic gangster who seeks nothing but riches which is far from the truth. Most of the treasures and land they had were given to them by people who sought penance for themselves and their families. If I were to give a homeless person $10 so that I can feel better about myself, what right do I have to condemn that person if he already has $20 on him. A lot of people think of greed or hoards of treasure when it comes to the Templars. That's not the case at all but rather a projection of their own values (or lack of) being placed. They had tons of valuables either found or given to them and they were very strict when it came to reporting such loot. A dishonest man will always view an honest one as being bad. ",

            "answer_text": "The ancient Knights Templar was actually quite awesome, I wrote a whole chapter recently about them in an upcoming book, and I have nothing but respect. In setting the stage, you have to bear in mind that they come from a time where everything was sorted through war and battle, the Kings would send in their men to sort out squabbles, and these campaigns would last years. However, with a slow but sure pace the general populace began emerging out of the Middle Ages, new ideas started to emerge. The idea of romanticism, where amongst Knights chivalry and valour ranked high and they became champions to the public. Initially they protected the route accompanying pilgrims on their route to the holy land. The Templar's existed for over 200 years and as the ranks grew to fight the Holy battles, so as they grew, they became a threat. More so since they had so much money that they loaned money to kings to assist in war efforts. Although they did not wholly start the idea of banks, think of them as the fathers of the real inventions that gave rise to it - cryptography and secure travellers cheques. So instead of travelling with gold, the travellers were given a viable alternative in the form of a Cheque or Deposit slip to carry with them. This would mean nothing to a thief, however would allow the traveller to withdraw funds at his destination. Now one of the Kings they were loyal to, as part of the Christian Realm (mainly western Europe) was the King of France, known as Phillip the Fair. He was anything but fair, and as he owed the Templar order a vast amount of money, but came up with a cunning plan. He summoned the Grand Master of the Templar's, who abided. Unfortunately he was promptly arrested on charges of heresy, along with all the Templar's stationed in France on that fateful Friday the 13th of October (origin of the Friday the 13th superstition). The charge was that of heresy (stepping on the Cross - Fig c.), and most controversially praying to Maphomet (as recorded phonetically). This was ironically a bastardisation from the name Muhammed. As from the Muslim faith as encountered in the Holy Land. This Maphomet became Baphomet in the writings of Elphias Levi, and he drew up a demonic vision of the goat headed creature you see on the internet today (Fig d.). This became even more popular in the mind of the populous when Leo Taxil shared some letters that detailed the practice of devil worship in his popular and controversial hoax to get back at the Catholic Church. Even though this was a very public and openly admitted hoax, of his creation, the details and misquotes he used are still in circulation today - cited as fact. It forms the meat of the arguments from the conspiracy theorists that we so regularly have to fend off. Part and parcel of why there is an evil connotation.His accompanying imagery being used base for many a conspiracy theory as proof of evil (Fig a.). I hope this gives a bit of a holistic view on the subject.   a. Knight Templar and Baphomet - image as seen online, missing a key part.  b. Knight Templar and Baphomet - original image footer, noting Leo Taxil as the originator.  c. Knights Templar Charges - illustration from the same publication.  d. Elphias Levi\u2019s Baphomet - as popularised and now a mainstream idea and icon for some reason. ",
