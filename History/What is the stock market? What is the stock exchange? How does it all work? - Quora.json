            "answer_text": "A stock market, equity market or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers (a loose network of economic transactions, not a physical facility or discrete entity) of stocks (also called shares); these may include securities listed on a stock exchange as well as those only traded privately. Trade in stock markets means the transfer for money of a stock or security from a seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. Equities (stocks or shares) confer an ownership interest in a particular company. Participants in the stock market range from small individual stock investors to larger traders investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include banks, insurance companies or pension funds, and hedge funds. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange trader. How Does the Stock Market Work? A stock market is where investors meet to buy and sell shares. Markets used to be literal places\u2014they were trading floors in New York, London, Tokyo and Frankfurt where prices for stocks were set in an ongoing live auction. Now most bids to buy and sell stocks are made electronically. You access these global electronic markets by placing an order through a broker. The cost for each trade typically runs from $5 to $10 per order, depending on your broker. Stocks are listed on the market by short names known as ticker symbols. When you search the ticker symbol \u201cMSFT\u201d on a news site such as MONEY or on your broker\u2019s website, the price quoted is the amount investors paid for the most recent lot of Microsoft shares traded. Prices on markets move very quickly, as demand for stocks ebbs and flows along with the latest news and investors\u2019 moods. So the price you see quoted for a stock may not be exactly the price you pay when you try to buy it. Visit here to know details about stock market: http://www.investmentchicken.com ",

Whether associated with a company or acting as an individual, a stock exchange is the place where stocks are bought and sold. There are a number of major stock exchanges around the world and each of these plays a part in determining the overall economic condition. The securities traded on a stock exchange include: shares issued by companies, unit trusts, derivatives, pooled investment products and bonds.

Buyers and sellers of shares and stocks can track the price changes of securities from the stock markets (derivatives, equity etc.) in which they operate.Also, stock exchanges have multiple roles in an economy which make it vital. These roles include: Raising capital for businesses (IPOs)Mobilizing savings for investmentFacilitating company growth and corporate governanceProfit sharingCreating investment opportunities for small investorsGovernment capital-raising for development projectsActs as a barometer of the economyHow does a stock exchange operate?With the help of stockbrokers, the buyers and sellers participating in a stock market carry out their transactions.
