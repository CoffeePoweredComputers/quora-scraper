            "answer_text": "That\u2019s an easy answer: it was defeated, and then switched sides. Italian army and regime crumbled like a Jenga tower when the Allies invaded Sicily (after suffering crushing defeats in Northern Africa, Russia and elsewhere). The main body of the government, the Grand Council of Fascism voted to depose Mussolini from the lead of the country and the Party; then, Mussolini was arrested (to be freed afterwards in a German commando operation; he was then put at the lead of a puppet state in Northern Italy, the Repubblica Sociale Italiana). Under the provisory rule of general Badoglio the Kingdom of Italy signed an armistice with the Allies, but failed to give precise instructions to Italian soldiers to join Allied forces and fight the Nazis; they were left at the mercy of German troops (stationed in Italy in aid of local defenses). So, yes, Italy switched site, but didn\u2019t even manage to do it well. The following contribute the regular Italian army gave to the defeat of the German army in Italy was mostly irrelevant. Meanwhile, in Northern Italy, under German occupation (that disguised itself as a fascist puppet state, as I mentioned above), a Resistence movement grew, organized by political parties and movement that were persecuted by the fascist regime (by numerical force, the most importants were the Communists and the progressive anti-fascists that coalesced under the name of Giustizia e Libert\u00e0; but there were also Catholic democrats and conservatives), and by Italian soldiers and police officers that managed to avoid capture by the Germans (they usually maintained their loyalty to the Monarchy and were usually called Badogliani, from the general Badoglio). From the point of view of military history, Italian Resistance didn\u2019t have a decisive impact. If the Allies had pursued the liberation of Italy in 1933 or 1944, the behind-the-line work of guerrillia fighters and saboteurs would have been precious; but the partisans weren\u2019t equipped for field war (even if they managed to occupy briefly towns and villages in a large scale uprising during the spring of 1944) or for a lengthy conflict, and suffered tremendous blows in the following months. But with more than 35000 Italian partisans killed in action during the war (and an almost equal number of Italian resistance fighters dead in France and in the Balkans), their moral contribute was no laughing matter. So, after the war, and after exiling the King and voting a new Constitution, the newborn Italian Republic claimed its legitimacy and its role among the winners of WWII by stressing the relation with the forces that fought in the Resistence (and not the continuity with the Monarchic regime that switched side). Which is, let\u2019s face it, kind of a stretch. But you have to work with what you got. ",
