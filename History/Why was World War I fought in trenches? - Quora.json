            "answer_text": "WWI occurred in a period when the Sword heavily outweighed the Shield. Throughout history you can see the difference between the two in every historical era. Medieval castles were rendered relatively useless by cannons. Iron weapons vs. Bronze weapons. Cavalry vs. a soldier square. The roots for WWI\u2019s style of warfare were birthed from the Crimean War, the American Civil War, and the Franco-Prussian War. The signs were evident in each of those conflicts that when the next major European war took place that it would be one of unprecedented bloodshed and death. The technological and tactical advances in those wars laid the groundwork for trench warfare and was something that was actively used in the Crimean and Civil wars. In those wars the Sword advanced more quickly than the Shield but it was never revolutionarily so. The weapons of the time, while deadly, were not powerful enough to fully force the opposing sides into permanent stalemate. In WWI however the advent and large-scale employment of belt-fed machineguns, quick firing artillery with high explosive shells and recoil devices combined with non-innovative tactics and the geography of Europe itself led to trench warfare on the Western Front. Until the tank and combined arms tactics were fully embraced the troops were relegated to the trenches. At the time only three types of ground combat arms truly existed; infantry (and its variants), artillery, and cavalry. Cavalry was basically useless in WWI. There were several charges but nothing that was going to prove ultimately decisive. Motorized vehicles/cavalry were still in its infancy and the vehicles could hardly cross the moonscapes that dotted Western Europe. Infantrymen found themselves being cut down like wheat by a scythe. Infantry would storm the trenches and if they made it to the other side and beat back the enemy artillery would be called down on them. Sometimes they would take the trenches only to find out that beyond that trench lay another and another. Artillery was the main killer in the war. With good reason too. Medium caliber field guns as the time could fire anywhere from six to twelve rounds a minute and with a fair amount of accuracy as well. So say the enemy has a battery of six guns firing six rounds per minute. That\u2019s 36 shells on target per minute. Each shell has a ~30 meter kill radius. That\u2019s enough to cover 1,080 meters at a minimum every single minute. Infantrymen in WWI were not spreading out like they did they on and so they were cut down by high velocity shards of metal. The First Battle of the Marne is what truly inaugurated the trench warfare commonly associated with WWI. The Allies lost nearly 90,000 men, dead and wounded, in a span of only four days. The Germans lost 67,000. This took place during the beginning of war when there was still a period of maneuvering, at least on a strategic scale. It became evident to both sides that such losses could not be accepted again and again. The Allies though were certainly the ones who adapted to this idea and situation slower than the Central Powers, namely the German Empire. Germany had less men, material, allies, and resources from which to draw upon unlike the British Empire, France, and the never-ending vastness of Russia. Realizing this they sought to turn the advancements in technology and trenches in order to work to their advantage. It is a common rule of thumb in warfare to possess a three to one advantage in favor of the attacker. Germany fully took advantage of this and made sure that the trenches of its men were of vastly superior quality when compared with their Allied opponents.    Not all the trenches looked this pristine of course but on average German trenches outclassed the others. But this clearly demonstrates the fact that Germany knew that it would be wiser for it to invest in the trenches and utilize a more defensive approach to the war. Most major offensives on the Western Front were undertaken by the Allied Powers while Germany struck with large forces sparingly notably the Spring Offensive in 1918 due the Russian knockout and the American entrance into the war. The lack of an effective means to advance into quick-firing machineguns and dissuade the perils of artillery fire quite literally forced men underground. Until the tank and refinements in tactics took the stage the course of the war was determined by a defensive Germany and by the Allies lacking the will to waste such an enormous amount of lives for such little gain. Once the tank made it\u2019s entrance then troops could assault across No Man\u2019s Land with the aid of precise, crawling artillery fire and produce actual lasting result. ",

            "answer_text": " INTRODUCTION Resulting in the deaths of 30 million people \u2014 9 million soldiers and 21 million civilians \u2014 as well as another 30 million or more injuries and the displacement of millions of others: World War One is most commonly depicted as a war of trenches. Soldiers living in a muddy ecosystem of machine guns, craters, vermin, snipers, shell shocked infantry and mud being added amongst the carnage of millions of dead surrounding the living in all directions. However, this is a very simplified version of World War One, and definitely not accurate to the real scenario of life on the trenches. While trenches were definitely used \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t be World War One without them \u2014 their purpose was far different than what one might expect today when they imagine a soldier\u2019s brains being displaced from their skull after having the misfortune of being a soldier hit by a sniper after poking their heads out at the wrong time or lighting a cigarette in order to soothe their nerves. Unlike what popular depictions of the war may indicate: trenches actually had far less of a role in the historical war than they have had in movies, games and books. The common scenario of waves of infantry attacking a well fortified trench directly is especially mythical and not something that commanders on either side thought was a good idea. While trench assaults were not unheard of \u2014 especially in the first year of the war \u2014 they were also not very common, and often times trench assaults were the result of a communication error regarding terrain as opposed to a deliberate and suicidal attack.  TRENCHES IN HISTORY Historically speaking, trenches have been more or less used in warfare for thousands of years \u2014 going back to at least the first dynasties of Egypt and Ancient China. The most common reasons for their use, was to give the defenders better means to defend themselves against an assault; safer living arrangements; as well as a way to prevent enemy combatants from infiltrating the back of the defenders\u2019 lines. While the latter two examples were still heavily relied upon in World War One \u2014 the former example quickly fell out of use, and the reasons as to why that is will become apparent as I discuss the types of weapons that were available between 1914\u20131918. For thousands of years, the most common weapons that soldiers in trenches had to face were spears, maces, axes, swords, arrows and, later, crossbows and longbows. By the eighteenth century, muskets and artillery were becoming increasingly common and relied upon for winning battles, but the intensity rate that muskets and artillery could fire in that period was still insufficient enough to justify the use of trenches for soldiers defending against an enemy attack. Stakes were used in ancient trench warfare as a way to prevent cavalry and even chariots from getting through without risking heavy casualties in the process. Often times booby traps, which were an early version of modern landmines, were also used in order to rack up some kills on advancing infantry. Forcing the enemy to jump into a trench with a wall of spears waiting to poke their eyes out meant that a fairly small number of defenders were more than capable of filling a trench to their ankles in the blood of their fallen enemies.  Above: I Told You Attacking A Wall Of Spears Was A Bad Idea! Sun Tzu\u2019s statement in the Art of War when he said that a man defending a narrow pass is as good as ten thousand attackers \u2014 while somewhat exaggerated \u2014 still says a lot about the effectiveness of proper defences in a time when long-range weapons did not exist (go ask the Persians at Thermopylae); forcing besieging armies to sacrifice a lot of manpower to take a position that would today be shelled to pieces without the loss of a single life on the attacking side. During the Caribbean and South American revolutions of the 1700s and early 1800s, European armies routinely set up trenches within the jungles, as a way to counter the guerrilla tactics that were common among the revolutionaries, including Simon Bolivar \u2014 someone that the Spaniards tried for years to assassinate, but without success. Trenches in South America and the Caribbean were therefore an easier way to surround a scattered enemy force that would otherwise be more than capable of avoiding the opposing army indefinitely. Trenches in jungle warfare also made it easier for defenders to be able to maneuver themselves from one area to the next by walking in the relatively safe and convenient trenches that also served as a road, rather than walking through the thick and treacherous wildernesses of the Caribbeans and South America.  Above: Damn Mosquitoes! Most ancient and medieval fortresses had trenches located within 100 feet of the foundation of the building itself. Having a trench situated too closely to the walls would not be a good idea as it would cause the wall itself to weaken and possibly collapse. However, they were kept close enough that the infantry sent to protect the trenches during an assault would have the support of archers (and, later, crossbows and longbows) while also being only a few steps away from the safety of the fortress gates located around the walls in the event that the defenders needed to retreat to the safety of the inner walls. The relatively short distance to the walls also meant that reinforcements from inside the fortress could be quickly dispatched in the event that the defenders decided that the trenches were sufficient enough to hold off an attack.  Above: Damn Catapults! The use of trenches also made it harder for cavalry to run down the infantry hiding inside the trenches while also giving protection from artillery \u2014 which did not usually explode upon impact until the early modern period. Before that time, artillery was either used to smash buildings or to wipe out entire columns of infantry by rolling on the ground like a murderous bowling ball and treating the legs of the hapless men standing in their way as bowling pins. Stakes further ensured that cavalry would not be able to charge through without sustaining casualties while also making it harder for the attacking infantry to march through the stakes without being forced to break their formation and momentum \u2014 something that would have been an asset to the defenders who were typically outnumbered by a large ratio in siege battles; enduring an attack that could last for days, sometimes years, without respite. Due to the amount of resources and human life it took to capture most cities and fortresses, siege battles, as well as direct assaults against fortified positions were rare when compared to some of the more efficient tactics that were used \u2014 such as razing harvests or hunting down and killing and/or capturing enemy soldiers and civilians caught out in the open where the protection of walls and trenches would not protect them from a numerically superior army. Until the last couple of centuries of military history, trenches definitely served their purpose, as it was not unheard of for defending armies with as few as a couple dozen men to hold off thousands of attackers for lengthy periods of time (and often times coming out victorious), due to the walls, trenches and other protection barriers that made the quantity of an attacking force moot. With the introduction of new weapons, particularly the modern artillery, this was about to change, and like other efficient weapons and tools in earlier warfare \u2014 trenches were about to lose their place as a vital military defence.  Above: Smoke From A Burning Toaster The fact that over 2,500 kilometres of trenches were built during the war on the Western Front alone can no doubt entrench (no pun intended) the myth behind World War One being a trench war. However, the purpose of these trenches had become much different than in earlier human history, as trenches were no longer seen as an effective form of defence against an onslaught of infantry in the same way that cavalry, while still sparingly used even in modern warfare, are no longer the most lethal weapon on the battlefield \u2014 capable of decimating entire ranks of medieval infantry with a swift and violent charge.  THE WAR YEARS By 1915, commanders on both sides had realised that trench warfare was not an effective means to conduct warfare in the twentieth century in the same way that they had given up the use of rank formations and scaling walls with ladders (something that was still being practised in 1914 during the opening phases of the war). Artillery, which had once been seen as an effective way to obliterate scores of infantry with a single, well-placed shot, was also beginning to change its role in warfare. Rather than being a weapon that would target enemy infantry during an attack, artillery was now seen as a weapon capable of providing cover for their own infantry by shielding them in smoke from enemy gunfire. By the 1910s, artillery pieces were capable of firing from a distance of up to 20 kilometres away, and shrapnel was even more dangerous and lethal for the average soldier than the shell itself. Artillery was actually so destructive \u2014 even after its primary purpose had changed from inflicting casualties to supporting attacks \u2014 that it inflicted more combat-related casualties than all other weapons in the war combined: rifles, machine guns, snipers, mines, chlorine and mustard gas included. A single artillery shell was more than capable of destroying a bricked building and reducing it to a mound of battered bricks, and even infantry in the trenches were not likely to be protected from a blast if it landed too closely to where they were \u2014 even if the shell did not hit the trench itself. Aside from artillery, mines \u2014 which were widely used until 1917 \u2014 were also effective at killing unsuspecting soldiers in the front line. It was not unheard of for diggers on both sides attempting to place a mine beneath an enemy trench to accidentally dig their way into another enemy\u2019s tunnel and a firefight would break out underground. Therefore, it was imperative for miners to make their way to the enemy trench first and score a hit before the opposing side had a chance to do the same thing.  Above: First! These reasons \u2014 though there were certainly others which I will get to \u2014 are among a plethora of examples as to why generals did not rely on trenches for defensive means. In fact, most trench systems \u2014 when fully built \u2014 had an average of three defensive trenches.  TRENCH LIFE The first trench, which is the one where the most fighting would typically occur and the one that most people imagine when thinking of trench warfare \u2014 was also the most lightly guarded. An average soldier rarely spent more than a day, sometimes two, on the first trench system. And after their brief tour, they usually could expect to not be rotated back there again for at least another month. The first trench system was also the least comfortable, and soldiers, especially on the Entente side, were often times forced to sleep in mud when being rotated to the first trench. The second trench, which was more heavily guarded, was far safer and comfortable than on the first trench. Soldiers in the second trench could read books, play card games (gambling being a frequent occurrence), engage in conversations with other soldiers, or play board games when one was available. Such luxuries were not the norm for soldiers in the first trench that were expected to be on the lookout at all times until they were rotated.  Above: Person That Comes In Last Is A Donkey! The third trench, which was usually the most populated of all three trenches, was also where soldiers in the second trench were allowed to retire for meals or to get some better sleep. Accommodations in the third trench varied depending on rank and nationality. Soldiers fighting for the Central Powers (Germany and Austria and their allies) usually had a much higher standard of living in the trenches when compared to the Entente (British, French, Canadians, Americans, New Zealanders, Australians, Russians etc.). One way to know whether a trench system was created by the Entente or Central Powers is by looking on the ground. If the bottom of the trenches have planks of wood, it is likely that they were created by the Entente. And if not, it was likely captured by the Entente and planks of wood were installed after the original trench had been decimated by artillery. Trenches that were built by the Central Powers, in contrast, were more likely to have concrete added to the bottom of the trenches.  Above: German Engineering At Work Early in the war, neither side thought of adding wood or concrete to the bottom of their trenches. This may be because until World War One, soldiers did not stay in trenches except for when a battle was underway or expected to be. Rotations were not used for the first several weeks of the war, and this resulted in many soldiers suffering from trench foot disease. Amputations became increasingly common, while soldiers fortunate enough not to be afflicted by this disease were still suffering from sleep deprivation or even shell shock, due to the fact that artillery had become so common and cheap compared to earlier wars, that combatants on both sides would continuously hurl shells at the enemy just to keep them awake for longer periods of time and wreck their nerves before fighting had even begun. By the end of 1914, both sides had learned this lesson, and they found more adequate ways to prevent further cases of trench foot disease by adding the wooden planks or concrete floors that are today usually found throughout what is left of the trenches of the First World War. They also began putting fewer and fewer soldiers on the front line as a way to reduce the amount of casualties that could be inflicted from an exploding trench mine or artillery barrage. The use of entertainment in the trenches themselves served yet another purpose of alleviating the boredom that soldiers on the front line commonly experienced, while also being a way to prevent their morale from being sapped. In the Entente trenches, latrines were available (even in the first trench), while the third trench system (which also served soldiers in the second trench) had shower rooms, dining halls, kitchens and even bedrooms. Officers in Entente trenches had their own rooms when they were not assigned to the first trench, while non-commissioned soldiers slept four to a room with two bunk beds allocated to each room.  Above: Well, This Aint Too Shabby\u2026 Except For Getting My Toes Kicked! Soldiers in the Central Powers had the same provisions as the Entente, and quite possibly much more. Running toilets were typically used for Central Power soldiers in the second and third trenches, and not only did they have their own entertainment rooms \u2014 some of the entertainment rooms included musical instruments, including pianos. Plumbing in trenches belong to the Central Powers were far more advanced when compared to those of the Entente, where plumbing was next to nonexistent. Refrigerators also contained beverages, such as beer, and sometimes Central Power soldiers in the first trench would be treated to such amenities during times when the trenches were quiet and inactive from fighting. Door bells were also installed in Central Power trenches, which meant that soldiers did not need to knock or shout in order to make their presence known \u2014 something that was never adopted in Entente trenches. Life in the trenches was not the muddy inferno that is more popularly depicted in media. While rodents were a hazard on both sides, and soldiers, especially in the first trench sector, had to keep their eyes on the lookout at all times for snipers, raiding parties and artillery \u2014 the only time a trench would look muddy and grotesque is if the trench was still under construction, or if an artillery barrage had recently obliterated the trench before repairs could be made.  Above: Soldier Being Shaved \u2014 Moments Before A Razor Will Make Him WIA On average, less than a third of all soldiers were living in the trenches at any one time \u2014 and this statistic mostly applies to combat soldiers, as non-combat soldiers were rarely, if ever, assigned to trench duty. And out of the third that were in the trenches, only a small fraction of them were at the forefront, where mortality rates were at their highest. Soldiers not on the front line could visit other towns and cities, and they could live the life similar to a civilian of the time period.  LIFE OUTSIDE THE TRENCHES Commonwealth soldiers \u2014 including Canadians, Australians and New Zealanders who were not permitted to return home during the war \u2014 could go to the United Kingdom and spend a few weeks at a time in England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland. Many Commonwealth soldiers with nationalities outside the United Kingdom had relatives living there, and so they were often times housed with their close kin during their stay. On average, leave to the United Kingdom occurred every six months.  Above: England Was About To Get A %$#*LOAD OF PUDDING! In months where Commonwealth soldiers could not go to the United Kingdom, Paris was a favoured destination, and it was within 100 kilometres of the front line throughout most of the war \u2014 making it a relatively short distance away by vehicle. Except in times when the war became dire, soldiers on both sides received much better food and healthcare than civilians \u2014 especially when they were not currently serving in the trenches. The average soldier in World War One served less than one in three days in the trenches, and less than one in thirty days in the more well known front line trenches peering out into No Man\u2019s Land. When returning to the trenches, soldiers were at first placed in the third trench for several days. Then the second trench for a couple of days. Lastly, the time spent in the first trench lasted for a single day before they would suddenly be rotated back out of the trenches and be given another furlough and possibly not have to return back to the trenches again for another month.  Above: Awwww\u2026 Come On! When Are We Going To See Some Freaking Action?! While war movies may concentrate on the gunfire and the carnage \u2014 veterans of the First World War later reported that what drove those in the trenches insane was not so much the fighting that would sometimes transpire, but the intense boredom of spending days or weeks in the trenches with little to nothing going on. Occasionally, an enemy combatant might be spotted, but it was more likely a scout, sniper or simply an infantry soldier stranded in No Man\u2019s Land making their way back to their trenches. Shells would land from time to time, mostly to keep the enemy combatants on their toes while also possibly scoring a lucky hit and making tomato juice out of an unsuspecting enemy sniper or scout venturing about in No Man\u2019s Land in the process. One common saying for soldiers that fought in World War One (as well as in many previous and subsequent wars) was: \u201c99% of the time you are bored out of your mind; and 1% of the time you are scared out of your wits.\u201d  NO MAN\u2019S LAND Of course, as I stated before: World War One wouldn\u2019t be World War One without a massive wave of soldiers coming out of their crater holes or trenches and swarming an enemy position with sheer numbers. While quantities of infantry were indeed heavily relied upon when capturing an enemy objective \u2014 the objective was unlikely to be trenches, but other, far more worthwhile objectives: hills, forests, ravines, bridges, rivers and even villages. The average distance between the first trench on one side and the other was 12 kilometres. While there were cases involving both sides getting so close to one another that they could hear the other side \u201cwhispering\u201d and even being able to throw grenades at one another \u2014 such situations were obviously not ideal, and opposing armies would have been quick to correct such mishaps by hastily building new trenches farther behind and averting more close-quarter fights.  Above: The Moment Oktoberfest Music Replaces An Artillery Barrage It should also be noted that while the average distance to cross No Man\u2019s Land may have been 12 kilometres, and that cases of trenches from opposing sides being built within earshot of each other did occur, the reverse could also be true, with cases of No Man\u2019s Land being up to 40 kilometres wide in some areas during certain phases of the war. Keeping your trench away from artillery was vital in reducing casualties as well as preventing any breakthroughs. Since trenches served as a haven for defenders in World War One in the same way that fortresses did for soldiers in ancient and medieval warfare, having your trench becoming vulnerable and easily shelled with no proper means to respond back was as good as losing the entire battle. Therefore, what was more crucial for both sides was not to attack the enemy trenches themselves, but to attack everything situated before them in the same way that football players will usually push closer to the enemy outpost before trying to score a touchdown.  THE BEST OBJECTIVES (TRENCHES NOT BEING ONE OF THEM) Hills were one of the most common objectives to capture for two obvious reasons: they made it easier to see the terrain from a longer distance, while also allowing artillery to fire from a longer range \u2014 hitting targets and trenches that would otherwise be out of range in a lower altitude. Rivers were also important, as it made it far harder for the enemy to launch a surprise raid without the likelihood of the defenders being notified of their presence beforehand. Rivers also made it easier for an area to be thoroughly defended with fewer soldiers needed. It also made it less convenient for the enemy to mine a trench when a river was in the way \u2014 something else that commanders on both sides were duly aware of, and the reason why it is that rivers, lakes and other bodies of water were usually seen as an objective just as important as a hill.  Above: Whose Brilliant Idea Was This?! Forests served the advantage of allowing infantry and even artillery and vehicles to take refuge in the thick layers of tree branches and leaves while minimising their chances of being spotted. This cover also made it much harder for enemy snipers and infantry to inflict losses on the defenders hiding in the forests, while simultaneously making it easier for their own snipers to target enemy soldiers and not have them fire back on them as a result. Even though trenches were no doubt the ultimate objective \u2014 as they almost always signified the end of a battle/campaign and a possible breakthrough, they were not the initial objective, and they most certainly were not the most heavily fought upon part of the battlefield, as trenches in World War One did not offer the protection of defending soldiers that hills, ravines and forests did. Even villages could often times serve as better protection, as a village that was still intact made it easier for infantry and snipers to move from building to building or from room to room with relative ease. In the event that a village was destroyed from fighting, infantry and snipers still found ways to create efficient hiding spots among the charred layers of desolated bricks and furniture.  Above: Waldo Is Definitely Not Here! Another crucial reason as to why trenches were rarely, if ever, the target of a massive wave of infantry was due to the second greatest killer of the war behind artillery \u2014 the dreaded machine gun. Capable of firing hundreds of rounds per minute, this gun was more than capable of vanquishing entire companies of advancing infantry in the seconds the gun would fire before it had to momentarily cease in order to prevent overheating. Harry Patch, the last known combatant of any nationality who died in 2009, was conscripted in the British Army and served as a machine gunner. He later said that if he would have been captured, he would have \u201cbeen lined up and shot with your own machine gun.\u201d Compared to artillery and machine guns, rifles inflicted very few casualties, and it is why machine gun crews were loathed by the opposing forces of both sides. Most captured machine gun crews were simply killed by attacking infantry, often times by being executed with their own machine gun.  CHARGING IS FUTILE Machine guns were kept in the second trench, as opposed to the first. Keeping them in the first trench made them too vulnerable to being destroyed by raiding parties or from surprise offensives. Not to mention, it made them far easier to spot and be targeted by artillery. If a sniper would have seen a machine gun crew in the first trenches, they would also no doubt have made them their primary target. Since first trenches were sparsely defended, it was not expected that they would hold out in the rare event that a full-scale infantry assault did take place. The first trenches merely served as a lookout as well as a way to temporarily halt an advancing attack long enough for soldiers in the second and third trenches to be alerted and respond accordingly. Most infantry were kept in the two rear trenches because not only did it make them less vulnerable to shelling, mines or unsuspecting attackers \u2014 it also made it easier for the defenders to throw a counterattack when there were more unscathed infantry present. Losing a small handful of infantry in the first trench was a small loss compared to possibly losing thousands of infantry and a possible breakthrough if all infantry were simply placed in the first trench and got chewed up by an artillery barrage before the defenders had the chance to fire a single shot.  Above: Surviving A Battle Was Not Fun, Either The use of the first trench also protected most infantry from gas attacks, because the type of gas used in World War One \u2014 chlorine and mustard being the two most common ones \u2014 is heavier than air, and so it will quickly lose momentum and simply go into the ground. The first trench may be more susceptible to a gas attack, and while over a million casualties were inflicted on both sides from gas attacks \u2014 many of them with grave and even lethal consequences \u2014 soldiers in the second and third trench systems were usually spared the wrath of chlorine and mustard gas.  THE \u2018BLOODIEST\u2019 DAY July 1, 1916 is considered to be the bloodiest single day in Commonwealth military history, as well as one of the bloodiest single days of any nationality or war in history. In addition to the staggering loss of no fewer than 60,000 British and Newfoundlanders, the French and Germans also lost thousands of men to the fray that became known as the opening campaign of the Battle of the Somme. It is also this particular event that has since reinforced the now common myth that World War One was primarily a war fought in trenches more than any other event in the war. However, the reality is that July 1, 1916 was not supposed to involve any action at all. For over a week leading up to this eventful day, the British and French had pummelled the Germans with no fewer than one million artillery shells over a stretch of 45 kilometres of terrain, which was believed to comprise some 20,000 German infantry and machine gunners. Until then, the Somme was considered to be one of the safest and quietest places on the Western Front, as it had been spared the fighting seen in other places, such as Flanders, and now, Verdun. \u201cNot even a rat could survive that,\u201d was a common saying among the soldiers and commanders of the Entente as they witnessed what was at the time the longest and most intensive artillery barrage in military history. Whereas the French Army had sent several divisions of French infantry from the Verdun front who were already accustomed to warfare \u2014 some having been already serving for nearly two years at this point \u2014 the 120,000 or so British and Newfoundlanders that were to participate in the same assault were raw recruits, most of them not having the opportunity to fire their weapon a single time in combat up until that day.  Above: The Kaiser Would Be Proud It was because of their inexperience that commanders such as Henry Rawlinson decided to make an order stating that all soldiers of the Commonwealth taking part in the attack were to walk, rather than march. While marching is still common in warfare, as it prevents infantry from fatiguing while also keeping them in formation \u2014 the main reason why this particular order was given on this day was because Rawlinson and his other commanders were not anticipating any resistance from the Germans when their men were to walk across the field and capture their trenches, and they did not want to create anxiety amongst the men who were about to partake in their first mission of the war. Presumably, the Germans that had been present when the barrage opened up had either all been killed or forced to abandon their positions. And while this was true for thousands of Germans who were killed or wounded throughout the week from the shells that pulverised their trenches, the same was not true for the majority of Germans that survived and were adequately prepared for a possible attack. Among the explanations later given as to why the attack went as badly as it and why the artillery barrage \u2014 up until then a surefire way to guarantee a victory: was because the coordinates of the German trenches were miscalculated. As a result, the majority of the shells fired went completely off their target and did nothing to the Germans stationed in the trenches.  THE SLAUGHTER COMMENCES At around 7 AM on July 1, 1916, the first wave \u2014 consisting of nearly 60,000 infantry \u2014 was sent over, and as ordered, the soldiers began to march their way over to the trenches. This gave the Germans additional time to prepare and bring reinforcements from the rear and replenish the trenches with riflemen and machine gunners. The preparation by the Germans was made all the worse by the fact that in some sectors, the artillery had stopped a few minutes earlier than they were supposed to \u2014 giving the Germans even more warning that an anticipated attack was now imminent. The combined British and French assault was supposed to have taken place a day earlier on June 30th, but it was postponed, due to a heavy torrent of rain the evening before that delayed the arrival of the attacking troops, as well as making the muddy conditions less favourable for marching. The rain during the week also caused many shells not to explode, and thus further weakening the preliminary attack by the British and French. When the British finally got within range, the Germans began to open fire. The Germans became astonished at the fact that rather than running towards them and firing back, the British continued to march out in the open with barely a shot fired from the hapless Tommies. German infantry were able to aim their targets down to a single infantry, while machine gunners continued to spray bullets and decimate the attacking British row by row.  Above: Too Easy! A parade ground was how the surviving German defenders of that day described the advancing British formation. The event was surreal, and many Germans later acknowledged that they were so vastly outnumbered by the advancing British that if they would have started running towards them they would have been quickly overwhelmed. However, since the British, still oblivious to what was going on, continued to follow their orders to a tee (no pun intended) and proceeded to march undaunted through the thick line of bullets that were permeating their ranks and reddening their uniforms with the blood of their comrades.  Above: When Barbed Wire Reddens Your Legs! Eventually, the attackers that had been fortunate enough not to be gunned down smartened up and finally realised that something was amidst. Many of them tried to tell headquarters what was going on, but the problem was that in many sectors this was not possible for the simple reason that every officer was now either dead or wounded, and their radio equipment had likely been shattered by the hail of bullets that were still firing over their heads like a swarm of angry wasps looking for prey to sting themselves into.  Above: Some Yellow Jacket Stung My Ass! In other sectors, where the British artillery had not miscalculated and done its job on shattering the German trenches, the attackers actually took the trenches with relatively light losses. And since those sectors were less heavily defended, officers were able to radio back to Rawlinson\u2019s headquarters and claim they had captured the German trenches. The impression was that the British had successfully broken the German defences and that the attack was already won.  THE SITUATION BECOMES PRECARIOUS For the next several hours, Rawlinson would not be made aware of what was taking place elsewhere on the battlefield, since there were no officers or working radio equipment to notify him of the series of disasters unfolding elsewhere as a second and then third wave of infantry marched out of their trenches and into what was later described by some survivors as a blinding snowstorm. Confusion became even more intense when it was reported that the more experienced French allies had themselves taken their objectives with hardly a hitch in the process \u2014 further convincing Rawlinson that the German trenches were lightly defended. Persuading himself that the attack was succeeding with little losses, Rawlinson made the decision to send the second and third waves \u2014 the last one consisting of the Newfoundlanders \u2014 which would allow the Germans to muster a kill count of some 20,000 Commonwealth soldiers and wound another 40,000 others by the time the sun would finally set. Had the news in other sectors not seemed so generous, or had there been surviving officers with working radio equipment in other areas that could have reported what was going on in time, it is quite possible that Rawlinson may have given the order to charge instead of march, and history may have played out quite differently.  Above: That Was Good Practice! Now For The REAL Thing! The Newfoundlanders sustained one of the highest losses that day of any battalion with only 68 of some nearly 900 attacking infantry being in fighting shape the next morning when roll call was made. In a span of 23 minutes, every officer in that regiment, alongside fourteen pairs of brothers and several hundred other men were killed or wounded near Beaumont-Hamel. Allegedly, most of the casualties sustained in this regiment were caused near a small tree in the middle of the battlefield. Naturally, these soldiers instinctively marched towards the small tree in order to gain even the slightest bit of protection. This allowed the German machine gunners and riflemen to simply point in the general direction of the tree and continue to further compound the carnage and humiliation that had already been taking place over the 45 kilometre Somme front. By the time the third wave had been launched, Rawlinson was finally receiving some less promising reports from some of the soldiers that had survived in the uglier spots of No Man\u2019s Land and ran to his headquarters by foot to cease committing any further soldiers. The news did not arrive before the second and third waves had been launched, but it did allegedly prevent a possible fourth wave from going over the top. After the news became overwhelming, orders were made to retreat all surviving men back to the trenches and await further orders.  FATHOMING THE LOSSES Nightfall came, and fewer than half of those that had left their trenches in the morning were still alive to oversee their friends dead or dying in the field, as well as their failure to accomplish what was initially supposed to be an easy task. Just twelve hours earlier, the orders were simply to march over into a trench that would be deserted from the shelling, capture it, and then repair the trenches until relieved. Since the Somme front had not been the site of much fighting up until this point, the British and French were easily able to get their artillery within range of the German trenches and open fire. While this attack should have been simple in theory, the problem came about when a combination of bad weather, miscalculating the coordinates of the German trenches, and the inexperience of the attacking Commonwealth soldiers all came into play. Had the weather not been so abysmal, it is likely that the attack would have been carried out a day earlier, and the terrain would not have been so wet and far more shells would have exploded as intended, further weakening the German positions. Also, had the artillery officers not miscalculated the positions of their targets, they would also have inflicted far more damage on the Germans than they did.  Above: Tea Time! Furthermore, had the Commonwealth soldiers participating in the attack been more experienced, not only would Rawlinson\u2019s orders not to run been so strictly enforced, the attackers would have known better than to march and they would have ignored the orders and proceeded to stay low and attack the German positions in a more tactical approach. All these hypothetical scenarios combined may have averted the calamity of July 1, 1916, as well as the misleading stereotype that World War One has suffered since then \u2014 that it was primarily trench warfare \u2014 but, unfortunately, this was not the case, and the wrong combination of factors helped create the chemistry that would culminate in the loss of 100,000 men on all sides on the first day, and over a million additional men over the next four months in a futile campaign that had started off as nothing more than a simple walkover.  STALEMATE WAR? While it would be naive on my part to claim that everything about World War One can be written within this text, I can safely state that the examples I have mentioned do a lot to serve their purpose in debunking the myth that trenches were used for offensive purposes. However, if readers are still not convinced and they want additional proof in this regard, consider the case of John Parr and George Price. Who are they you may ask? John Parr, who was a sixteen year old British teenager who lied about his age and claimed to be twenty, was killed while on patrol by some German horsemen on August 21, 1914 near the village of Mons.  Above: Where It All Started Ironically, Mons was also the same place where German commanders on the Western Front had gathered on November 11, 1917 \u2014 exactly one year to the day before the armistice \u2014 to discuss further plans on how to win the war. It was also at this same spot that Canadians would carry out the final offensive of the war of any nationality when Mons was assaulted and captured just before 8 AM on November 11, 1918. So, where does George Price come into this? Price, who was 25 years old at the time, having enlisted in 1916, was patrolling the area just outside of Mons. Ville-sur-Haine, a small Belgium village approximately ten kilometres from Mons, was where Price and his squad were sent to for what was likely the last mission of any group of soldiers in the war. Some 30,000 casualties were inflicted on the Western Front that day \u2014 more than three times the number inflicted on D-Day on June 6, 1944 \u2014 and Price, while this has been disputed, officially became the last of those 30,000 casualties when he was shot by a sniper at 10:58 AM. A village woman had seen what had happened, and she rushed over to bring him inside with his other squad members helping out, only for Price to succumb to his injuries less than a minute later and dying in their arms at 10:59 AM \u2014 when artillery pieces a short distance away were beginning to fire off their rounds for the last time. John Parr was killed near the village of Obourg in what is now part of Mons, Belgium. The site of his death is approximately five kilometres away from where George Price would himself be killed four years later. Since they died in such close proximity, Parr\u2019s headstone is only three graves away from where George Price is buried at the Saint Symphorien Military Cemetery. The grave of George Edwin Ellison \u2014 the last British soldier of the war to die, having been killed ten minutes before Price at around 10:50 AM \u2014 is also buried within the same cemetery.  Above: Where It All Ended How, then, could these soldiers have died within such close range of another if World War One was NOT a war of attrition? The answer can be found in the examples of some of the major offensives launched during the war by both sides. On the German side, the Schlieffen Plan, which was posthumously reformed, as well as the Verdun Offensive, were the two biggest single attacks the Germans launched within the first three years of the war \u2014 with counter-attacks as well as smaller offensives in the Flanders areas, particularly at Ypres, also being among the German offensives launched prior to 1918. While the offensive of 1914, as well as the possible gas attacks of April 22\u201324, 1915 may have been the two closest times the Germans came to winning the war on the Western Front \u2014 the third closest was no doubt the launching of Operation Michael in March 1918 which saw the Germans pushing the British and French right into the northern suburbs of Paris. During the first week of this offensive alone, the British are believed to have sustained up to 300,000 casualties in a vain attempt to stem the German tide from sweeping out the rest of the Entente Army. Paris itself was nearly captured, and only the sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of British and French soldiers over the next few weeks saw the German numbers hollow out and quickly allow the Entente to start regaining some loss ground. By the summer of that year, the Entente were preparing for yet another summer offensive \u2014 having suffered greatly the year before in the quagmire fields of Passchendaele. A growing number of American soldiers had started to arrive during the late summer, helping to contribute soldiers in engagements of their own, including the Argonne Forest. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth won several battles in quick succession, including Amiens, Arras and Cambrai.  Above: ??? By October, the Germans and their allies, who were facing a communist revolution similar to what the Russians had suffered, began to lose hope that the war could be won. On November 7, 1918 \u2014 the same day that the Bavarian Soviet Republic was officially created \u2014 the German commanders surrendered and demanded an instant ceasefire. The Entente refused, stating that the ceasefire would not come into effect until November 11, 1918 at 11 AM, by which time another 100,000 soldiers, as well as thousands of civilians, would either lose their lives or become physically impaired, often times for life. Coincidentally, the war lasted just long enough for General Arthur Currie, commander of the Canadian Armed forces, to launch the attack at Mons \u2014 the same village that the British first encountered their German foes four years earlier, and lost. This time, the Entente managed to take the village, causing some of the last shots of the war to be fired taking place within earshot of where the first shots had also been fired, back in August 1914.  THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR This odd coincidence meant that future generations would get the impression that the war was simply a long war of attrition and stalemates, when in fact, the war was far more mobile and revolutionary than has been credited. At the start of the war, armies were still marching in rank formation similar to the Napoleonic Wars a century earlier, with riflemen representing virtually every combat unit on the battlefield. Within four years, this had changed, with armies fighting in smaller squads with a variety of weapons, and aircraft and military vehicles becoming increasingly relied upon. Granted, when it came to tanks, the Germans did not think as highly of them as they should have \u2014 building only twenty tanks in comparison to the thousands used by the Entente \u2014 but the Germans nonetheless were more advanced when it came to providing standards of living for their front line soldiers that were overall more advanced than the Entente.  Above: W-W-W-W-W-E-E-E-E-E!!!!! Vimy Ridge, most well-known as a battle fought by Canadian soldiers between April 9\u201312, 1917, was also the first time in military history that maps were given to every soldier participating in the battle. Until then, only officers were issued maps. Currie decided to change all of that when it became clear that in the event that an officer was killed or wounded, non-commissioned soldiers would need to carry on and be able to understand their objectives. Canadian soldiers were therefore trained how to read a map before the battle was to commence on Easter Monday, and a model of Vimy Ridge was also created to give the attacking infantry a 3d version of the issued maps they were expected to understand. Aircraft also became more useful over the next four years as being a good way to spot out enemy targets, as well as being able to scout enemy trenches from the relative safety of the air. Most pilots were not killed from the war, but were instead killed while in training. In the event they were shot down in a dogfight, an experienced pilot would have been able to land their aircraft without causing death or injury to themselves. Enemy pilots would also rarely continue shooting after a plane was downed, since it was seen as dishonourable to not give their opponent a chance to save their lives.  Above: Current Score: 80\u20131 On the Eastern Front, far fewer stalemates occurred, which meant that the war on the Eastern Front was even more mobile than on the Western Front \u2014 with cavalry charges and constant advancing and retreating being common throughout the war.  GALLIPOLI Looking to the South-East, the Ottoman Empire, which had also joined the war in 1915 on the side of the Central Powers, is most remembered today for the Campaign of Gallipoli. However, just like the Somme, Gallipoli was never intended to be a campaign that would nearly jeopardise the entire war in the Middle East for the Entente, but a simple landing with little to no resistance expected. A month before the landing, on March 18, 1915, the French and British had launched a naval assault, immediately followed with a bombardment of several land targets that were intended to soften up Ottoman defences. While several ships were sunk that day, including the French ship Bouvet, which had struck a mine, as well as the British ship Irresistible \u2014 the operation was regarded a success, and the landings were prepared.  Above: Bienvenue! From the beginning, delays occurred which gave the Ottomans extended time to prepare. Initially planned for April 23rd, the attack was not carried out until April 25th when British, French and Anzac soldiers began landing on several beaches \u2014 including Kum Kale, which was where most of the French landed, as well as Cape Helles, which was where most Commonwealth soldiers were landed. For the first few hours of the attack, the Entente were successful in beating off the Ottomans with few losses of their own. However, there was a lot of confusion regarding where their objectives were \u2014 due to British cartographers, including T.E. Lawrence, later known as Lawrence of Arabia \u2014 making several crucial mistakes regarding the layout of the Gallipoli region which caused the Entente soldiers to not take advantage of their momentum and capitalise on their early success and capture the surrounding hills when they were still undefended. By the time the Entente attempted to correct their mistakes, it was too late, as the Ottomans had sent in reinforcements and captured the hills before the Entente could take them. While the Entente tried for the next week to take those hills in order to gain a breakthrough, the Ottomans proved to be just as determined to hold them, and so the Entente ultimately never advanced more than a few kilometres inland throughout the eight months that the land campaign would last before the French and Commonwealth forces would steadily withdraw, with the last defenders officially leaving during the dead of night on January 9, 1916.  Above: Lawrence of Arabia\u2019s Future Enemies If the Entente had received better map information, or if the attacking Entente had realised the mistake early on and corrected it, it is very likely that the Entente would have taken the high ground on the first day of the landing, and the outcome of the campaign would have been far different than it ended up being. It will never be known whether or not a better result of the Gallipoli campaign would have also meant an earlier end to the war, but it most certainly would not have become the Somme of Ottoman Europe. And if commanders on both sides had not made costly errors which resulted in battles that resulted in scores of combatants being killed and the fields littered with their bodies as a result with little to no short-term gains: World War One would not have received the undeserved reputation of being a war of trenches.
