            "answer_text": "Most empires didn't view in this way. The British and Roman empires saw trade and improvement of life and bringing civilisation to people who lived in brutal conditions. This way they could keep the peace in their own and other lands and make life better for themselves and others through taxes and trade. Some empires were bloody and harsh like the Ottomans who forced conversions and kidnapped children or the Horde of Ghengis who had a very short term empire and one of the most violent. But empires weren't about inferior people's being exploited. If that was the case the empire would ride in destroy the country and carry off booty as had happened before in earlier history with little care for staying there and improving the lot of the people living there which was a costly investment. For example the British in India put Indians in charge of their own regions and Indians still ran many of the businesses. The British never had a mind to take over and subjugate inferior people, but infact wanted peace for the Indians and themselves so slowly began to take control and give structure to the land when they were asked to do so. Ultimately creating a unified India we see today. In America similarly the colonists were protected by the royal navy and sent supplies and new personnel regularly ensuring they could survive and eventually become self sufficient. Also long term there was no desire to keep these countries in this state forever. But to build them to the point they were self sufficient. No one viewed the people as inferior, though they may have thought their position was inferior through technology or rulers when dealing with less advanced cultures. People knew that man has the potential if given the same advantages. So to answer your question most empires cared about their colonies or they wouldn't have lasted long or gone down the empire route in the first case. Usually people who thought others inferior exterminated them or enslaved them as a race as the Indians did to the lower castes, as africans and south Americans did to opposing tribes and as Ottomans did to Europeans in the Balkans to a lesser extent.

            "answer_text": "An empire is a machine and cannot care about anyone, for better or worse. People representing empires have cared about the people they were put in charge of and tried to use their power for that purpose. Presumably that includes even the rulers, though that is claiming telepathy. In fact though, whether or not an emperor cares about his people is beside the point. Realistically no one cares about numbers except in the abstract and people one does not know are numbers. There is no reason however that an emperor could not have sense of duty, or enlightened self-interest. ",
