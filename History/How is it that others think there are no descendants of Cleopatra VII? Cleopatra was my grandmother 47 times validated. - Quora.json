            "answer_text": "Cleopatra's line did not end with her as you said. Her daughter and youngest two sons, her children with Mark Antony, outlived her and their father and where brought back to Rome were they where raised in Octavian/Augustus' household, and while of the two sons one most likely died from disease relatively early and the fate of the other is almost entirely unknown the daughter, Cleopatra Selene II, however grew up and was married to Juba II, who had also been raised in Augustus' home and further was the heir to the Roman client kingdom Mauritania. After their marriage that couple ruled Mauritania from Caesarea(modern Cherchell, Algeria) and had one son, Ptolemy of Mauretania. He was the king famously lured to Rome and executed by Caligula, but he also left a daughter, Drusilla. Drusilla was first married to a Greek named Antonius Felix, but was later divorced by him as he fell in love with another woman, Drusillas second marriage was then with the Priest King of Emesa Sohaemus. Drusillas descendants then became the Royal family of Emesa, who while they where eventually stripped of their royal status when Emessa was absorbed into the Roman province of Syria maintained their hereditary position as high priests of the Sun God Elagabalus. This until one of daughter, Julia Domna, of this family was prophesied to be destined to marry a future king, a man named Septimius Severus allegedly heard this legend and tracke her down and married her. She bore him two sons, today known to us as Caracalla and Geta, and following year of the five emperors Septimius Severus came out as the founder of the Sevaran dynasty. When he died Caracalla and Geta inherited the Roman empire and after them the grandchildren of Julia Domnas sister, Julia Maesa, Elagabalus and Alexander Severus also got their turns as Emperors. Alexander Severus is then generally being viewed as the last Emperor of the Principate, meaning a direct descendant of Cleopatra saw the end of the Imperial order established by the man responsible for her death.\ufeff ",

Likely a huge portion of the population of places once ruled by Rome have her somewhere in their genealogy. Now, I think your claim that Cleopatra was my grandmother 47 times validated. Seems unlikely. It's possible that she is an ancestor, but the number of generations seems off. Cleopatra died in 30BC. Even if she had had a child that same year that makes for 2048 years between then and now. Now as you claim her to be Great x47 Grandma that means that there are 49 ancestors between you and her. Even if you are the oldest living person at 117 years old , that means that the average age of each ancestor when the next generation was born was 39 years old. Assuming that you had a mix of male and female ancestors, your female ancestors would be having kids unusually late and your male ancestors would be quite ancient with respect to their spouses. ",

Cleopatra\u2019s known family tree extends for several more generations after her death, though things do eventually become quite doubtful after a while. That said, how has it been validated that Cleopatra is your ancestor? There are all kinds of family legends about people\u2019s ancestry which are, it turns out, completely false. There are any number of people in the US, for example, who claim Cherokee ancestry, but it doesn\u2019t take more than a little genetic testing to prove that one way or another. Now, if you\u2019ve had DNA testing establishing a relationship with Cleopatra, then that\u2019s excellent. However, absent that or a 2000 year long chain of documentary evidence establishing your personal links with the Ptolemaic dynasty, let me gently suggest that there are other, more plausible explanations for your belief in a particularly glamorous ancestor.
