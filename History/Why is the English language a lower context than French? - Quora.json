            "answer_text": "Anthropology is not any part of my expertise set, but I\u2019ll take a stab at this. French speakers enjoy a high quantity of cultural similarity. The same jokes, myths, stories and complete background are largely held by all French people. This means that when they speak to each other, they can use this shared body of knowledge as context for any discussion. So there are many things that need not be said, because they will be understood by anyone who is French, and that is one thing that is meant by \u2018being French\u2019. Americans (I\u2019ll pick on my own countrymen, thank you) are a nation of immigrants. The \u2018melting pot\u2019 is not complete, and not all Americans know about, say, Paul Bunyan. I do because I lived in Michigan, and that particular set of tall tales is very common there. But I can\u2019t use Paul or Babe (his giant blue ox) as the basis for a description of something. The fact that not all Americans know of Paul means that I would often have to explain him - so I wouldn\u2019t save any time at all. While there are things that (just about) all Americans know of, it\u2019s a skimpy set compared to the richness of any of the old European countries. So it\u2019s not specifically the language that\u2019s low context, it\u2019s that my countrymen have less shared experience to draw on. This means that when I speak my US English in the USA, I have to explain more of the little things that French speakers (within France, especially) can take for granted and slide over. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not quite know what you mean. \u2018Context in language are the words surrounding a meaning. Putting into context. So the person asking the question has little grasp of English, as I don\u2019t understand \u2018lower\u2019? If it means \u2018less\u2019, then it is a troll question. And from huge ignorance. France has between about 100,000 -130,000 words. But up to 300,000 actual words attributed to the language. English has by far the most words in the world. Certainly in the western world. English has at least 170,000 words. Much because it is a hitch pitch if languages. This is why I would say without argument. The greatest literature giants are British. Yes, France and Italy: art, classical music, opera etc\u2026.But Britain literature. Shakespeare, Milton, Dickens, Austen, Bronte, Agatha Christie, Byron, DH Lawrence, Shelley, Chaucer, Kipling, Hardy, Tennyson, Tolkien, Johnson, Joyce, Orwell, Ian Fleming, Conan Doyle, CS Lewis\u2026\u2026 Britain also compiled the first dictionary. So if the question implies that English is less rich than French, then it is very wrong. However, I love the Rich French accent! ",
