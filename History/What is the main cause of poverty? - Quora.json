            "answer_text": "It is all due to global politics dictated by arms dealers, mega corporations and hegemonic ambitions of major leaders. As a result, terrorists can get money and weapons easier than the poor get food and medicine. All the global jihadi groups whether the ISIS, Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, Lashkar-e-Toiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad etc are vital for the healthy bottom lines of global arms manufacturers. Needless to say, they are useful pawns in the major power rivalry. I am astonished to see extremely well fed people are still killing each other in places lie Syria or Libya. The Iraq and Afghanistan wars against terror consumed trillions of dollar \u2014 with global approval!! Yemen presents a unique example of extreme poverty in a filthy rich neighborhood, and it is purely due to distorted ideology. In Yemen, the humanity is suffering due to Shia-Sunni tribal warfare, despite following the same prophet and same Book. Now talk about money to fight global warming or global poverty \u2014 you won\u2019t see any initiative from the global bully US or its allies. They have created an economic world order where just 1% humanity controls as much wealth as rest of the 99%. You would never see tabloids like Forbes counting poverty or increasing numbers of climate refugees \u2014 unless of course for glamour purpose. Why? Because poverty brings down labor input costs for the corporate houses \u2014 therefore, poverty is simply wonderful as it grows companies\u2019 bottom lines. Now just look at Trumps foolish threat of tariff war against the poor neighbor Mexico, if it doesn\u2019t help curb illegal migration into the US. A sane way to achieve what he wants is to help Mexico develop in multiple ways and raise the standard of life there. A mighty nation like the US could easily do that \u2014 it would automatically discourage Mexicans from leaving their home and country. But that\u2019s not possible in a world run on animal behavioral science \u2014 you kill me or I kill you (survival of the fittest)! ",

            "answer_text": "The guy who said you need to define poverty first has a really valid point, and he even describes his experience of going from satisfaction with his life, to being oppressed by relative poverty, without much change in his conditions of living. I think what most people are really appalled at is privation, and the world actually does have enough resources to provide for every living person so that none need suffer privation. There is enough food, and water, and housing, there is nearly enough potential for simple medical care, like treating broken bones, infections, and vaccinations. Here in the US homeless people sleep outside boarded up building that might home them at a lower cost than the services we DO provide them as homeless persons. Enough food gets thrown away to feed all the hungry. It is a matter of priorities and distribution that underlies privation now, most of the time, in most of the world. Wars and famines displace people, and cause temporary states in which many people suffer privation. Dragging that privation out for years in refugee camps that do not meet their needs is a matter of distribution and priorities. In underdeveloped nations, many families or persons value large numbers of children, because that is the only form of social safety net they have - but if their priorities were different, they might instead value fewer children that would not overburden their local resources, and live better. Some people value the rental profits, or even more fundamentally, the property tax value, of unoccupied buildings suitable for habitation more than housing people. Some people value the convenience of just throwing away food that does not sell, over making sure it gets to someone who will eat it, even if they do not profit from it. If we want to eradicate long term privation for all mankind, we CAN do that, but we have to change our priorities, and work on distribution. If we want to eliminate relative poverty, well that is a LOT harder, and maybe not a really great goal anyway. People LIKE to strive to better themselves, and so long as that is possible, it is fine to have relative poverty, because without it, you can\u2019t strive for relative wealth. It is probably worthwhile to narrow the gap between the wealthy and the poor though, and it is certainly worthwhile to eliminate privation. ",
