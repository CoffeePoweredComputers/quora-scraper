            "answer_text": "This is a really interesting question: thanks for asking it. Like the best questions on Quora, there is much more to it than one might first think. First, let\u2019s get rid of the idea that travelling by horseback was better, in any way, than sailing. During the Middle Ages, Edinburgh to London was a long, slow and extremely dangerous journey and would have taken anything up to a month and a half with a well shod horse. Travelling in a group would have been essential as would either a diplomatic or Papal safe passage passport. Of course, a court messenger carrying an important communication could have done better but for 99% of the population, travelling from Scotland to England by land was horrendously difficult and very dangerous. In a cart, things would have been even worse. So to sea travel. I\u2019m going to assume that we are using a state of the art Caravel built in Portugal in the mid-15th century. Our ship would have a tonnage of around 100 and a 75 feet waterline. At this length, and waterline, she is capable of a theoretical maximum speed of 11kts: note theoretical.  Beginning in Leith, Edinburgh\u2019s port, the first issue is being warped away from the dock \u2013 being pulled out to sea by rowing boats. With a ship as small as ours this isn\u2019t a huge problem but it is still a two or three hour job to get her clear of the dock and into the river Forth. Timed correctly, with the tide on the ebb, we could be off the North Berwick headland in another three hours. Now the fun really begins. These medieval ships sailed best with the wind behind them on what is called a reach. I\u2019m going to be doubly kind and give our skipper a north by north-easterly wind which is blowing at a nice 15kts (about 18mph): in other words, perfect conditions. He can now sail across the wind which will get him out into the North Sea and then bear away to the south on a nice long reach. In these ideal conditions, he will manage around 8kts. However, his watch keeping will have to be spot on because that wind is also pushing him on to the shore \u2013 and certain death \u2013 so he will probably stand off from the coast by maybe 20 miles. This will add to his overall journey distance. If I were sailing this passage, without the aid of a diesel engine, this is what I would do. Theoretically, the distance to London is 500 miles and, at an average of 8kts, it should take about two and half days. But, there is already half a day getting started on the passage and at least the same to go from somewhere off Shoeburyness to Greenwich. In total, this will give three days plus. Of course, the theory is vastly different from the practice. During some parts of Christopher Columbus\u2019 first Americas\u2019 expedition he managed only a mile a day. Regardless, let\u2019s give our skipper every advantage and say that the north by north-easterly in consistent and steady: he really is a lucky sailor! Even so, he has to stand off well away from Cromer and this increases his total distance even more. If the weather changes then so does the passage time \u2013 and dramatically. Medieval ships did not sail well across the wind and drifted badly downwind. Given a shift to the west and our skipper would have to come across the wind to go east round Norfolk adding expensive miles to his journey. Of course, a south-westerly \u2013 the prevailing wind in Britain \u2013 would pose real problems. Now, his 8kts average speed looks like fantasy. Finally, if the weather turned nasty then the smart thing to do was to put into any of the east coast ports which were offering safe havens. For sure, that\u2019s what I would be doing. So, in totally and absolutely perfect conditions and an utterly blessed, incident free, passage three and half days from Leith to Greenwich. If things were just ordinarily imperfect, seven days and given any of a huge range of potential problems a couple of weeks. Still, all this was still much better than travelling over land which was slower, vastly more dangerous and you couldn\u2019t carry sufficient goods to make a profit on the journey. If you like sailing stories do have a look at my book \u201cHostie\u201d which is the fictional story of a young woman\u2019s adventures sailing in Greece.
