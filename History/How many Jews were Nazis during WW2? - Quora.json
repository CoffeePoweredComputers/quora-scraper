            "answer_text": "One specific example comes to mind. One can think of more if you consider that 150,000 Mischlinger fought for Germany. Mischlinger though were mixed. So many didn\u2019t even view themselves as Jewish, but found out they were when the race laws were enacted. Also it is worth distinguishing between those who fought for country and those who supported Hitler and Anti-semitism. This brings me on to one example. In 1921 the Association of German National Jews was set up. It had 7,000 members. They existed during the Weimar Republic and espoused their support for Hitler. They were lead by Max Naumann who was a staunch patriot from an assimilated Jewish family who advocated the eradication of Jewish identity and the expulsion of Eastern European Jews. On Hitler\u2019s ascent: \"We have always held the well-being of the German people and the fatherland, to which we feel inextricably linked, above our own well-being. Thus we greeted the results of January, 1933, even though it has brought hardship for us personally.\" He described Eastern European Jews as \u2018dangerous guests from the East\u2019 who were \u2018racially inferior.\u2019 Naumann was from a well established West Prussian family. He stated that Nazi actions against the Jews were justified because Jews weren\u2019t assimilated enough. \u201cUnwilling to slough off their oriental traits, they are a disturbing factor to us who are bound to the soil.\u201d He referred to the NSDAP as being the only party capable of bringing about the \u2018Rebirth of Germandom.\u2019 He advocated the confiscation of properties of Eastern Jews. His argument was that the only solution to anti-semitism was strict assimilation. He blamed the Jews for antisemitism, which included non Eastern-European Jews. Their lack of a desire to assimilate like him. Particular racist vitriol was reserved for the Eastern Europeans however. His views were opposed by the vast majority of Jews for understandable reasons. He evidently misread Hitler and thought his desire to assimilate, be a Nazi, and fight the Jews would gain him acceptance. This was proved wrong when he was arrested by the Gestapo and his organisation disbanded. Just an addition. Quite bizarrely he would end his meetings with his organisation by unveiling the Hitler salute and yell \u201cDown with Us!!\u201d  ",

Movie director Kurt Gerron was first forced into collaboration with the NS-regime , and finally died in the Auschwitz Concentration Camp.He is amongst others famous for the 1944 pseudo documentary propaganda film Thersienstadt.Believe it or not, Magda Goebbels/Quandt the First Lady of the Third Reich was a Zionist in her early days. She even learned the Hebrew language and wore a necklace with the Star of David (\u2721) attached. One of her former names (apart from Quandt) was Friedlaender and she had a relation with her Zionist classmate Viktor Chaim Arlosoroff. He took her for a Jew because of her name that she adopted from her step (or even biological ?) father Richard Friedlaender a Jewish merchant who died in the Buchenwald concentration camp on Feb. 18th, 1939. She didn\u2019t lift a finger to rescue him for good reason.
