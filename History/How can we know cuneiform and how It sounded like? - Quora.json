            "answer_text": "Cuneiform is among the earliest methods of writing used by the Sumerians about 6,000 years ago. Cuneiform means it has a characteristic \u2018wedge shape.\u2019 Cuneiform poses certain challenges to translate and interpret meaning. One person who almost devoted his life to doing this is Zechariah Sitchin who wrote a series of 7 books called \u2018The Earth Chronicles.\u2019 The reality is, it is almost impossible to know exactly what the Sumerians were really saying, the context of the messages they were giving, and why they felt the need to give their stories some degree of permanence. The reward Sitchin got for his effort was an onslaught of controversy. It\u2019s interesting. To me cuneiform meaning \u2018wedge shape\u2019 is misleading because it looks to me more like a writing made of \u2018pictures\u2019 than varied use of wedges. I think the main distinguishing factor of deciding something is cuneiform is the place(s) where it is found to exist. I am not really qualified to make further comment on how you technically recognize it and separate it from other forms of writing. I am curious that you would want to know what it \u2018sounded\u2019 like. The pure version of the \u2018language\u2019 used at the time is lost. It disappeared in the cultural streams that flowed historically from the civilization of Sumer to the degree that its purity was totally lost. But your question leads me to also wonder what \u2018music\u2019 they had, the tonal sounds they expressed, the feelings experienced, and the dances of celebration they performed. All of these questions, one day, will be answered. These answers will become available from two sources: 1) access gained by individual souls to their soul records which reveal the experiences they personally had in Sumer and 2) access to the Akashic Records which not only contains the soul records, but also the complete recorded history of Creation since its inception. It is my guess that since you are asking these questions, that your soul is somehow yearning to revisit experiences you personally had in Sumer. I hope my answer touches this yearning and somehow your soul is bathed in the comfort that the day will come when it will find the peace of knowing and experiencing that it needs. May you find your own love, joy, and peace through the shortest route. ",

            "answer_text": "We don't but every once in a while we can make an educated guess. Our best friend is, of course, Akkadian which, thank God, is Semitic (so, you know, actually related to languages that we know perfectly well). And so we see what kind of Akkadian words look distinctly non-Semitic and then reasonably assume they are probably loanwords from Sumerian. When it comes to Sumerian, some pictographs will be accompanied by phonetic signs which gives us a hint about its meaning. Sadly, however, a good chunk of words we know only by their Akkadian/Semitic pronunciation and if those are never represented in Sumerian by anything other than a pictogram, then all we can do is just use Akkadian as an indispensable intermediary. All of which, ironically, gives Sumerian this distinct Semitic feel which it most definitely didn't possess. Imagine if overnight all knowledge of Chinese pronunciation became lost and then we would have to rely on the Japanese kanji to reach a consensus that the closest to proper way of rendering \u4e1c\u4eac in Chinese would be \u201cTokyo\u201d rather than \u201cD\u014dngj\u012bng\u201d. That's essentially what even the best Assyriologist out there would have to deal with if he were suddenly teleported to the city of Ur 3,000 years B.C. And that's not even mentioning the tones which, as many claim, quite likely were an inherent feature of Sumerian, due to the sheer amount of homophones which would otherwise transform the entire language into incomprehensible gibberish when spoken out loud.
