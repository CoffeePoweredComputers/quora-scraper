            "answer_text": "The \u201cOpen Door Policy\u201d was a neutral-looking cover for the US ultimatum blocking the Russian-German attempt to partition North China into colonies. US diplomats William Woodville Rockhill and Hay counseled the Qing court to disavow the Boxers, which gave the US space to lobby against abolition of the Qing court, preserving the Qing state. \u201cInternational colony\u201d is not a particularly informative formulation. There were very different eras including the treaty port and Taiping Rebellion era, then a resurgence of the Qing state, and then sudden attack by Japan and Europeans from 1894. After 1900 China had avoided dismemberment and started to modernize rapidly, but was still hampered by the Boxer Indemnity debt, 87% to European countries and 50% to Russia and Germany alone, which eventually triggered the Railway Protection Movement and 1911 revolution.
