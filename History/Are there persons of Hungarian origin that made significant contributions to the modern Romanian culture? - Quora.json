            "answer_text": "Yes. I\u2019d start with the Hungarian prince of Transylvania, Gabriel Bethlen (Bethlen G\u00e1bor) - who supported the building of various schools for Romanians in Transylvania; the first known poem written in Romanian was written by a guy who studied in one of these schools, IIRC - , but I doubt his accomplishments in relation to Romanians would be considered part of the modern period. The Hungarian composer B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k also comes to mind, one of the founders of ethnomusicology; he kinda put the (Western) Romanian folklore on the musical map. Feel free to listen to his Romanian Folk Dances if you don\u2019t believe me. Sure, his contribution was an indirect one but it should still count. Carol Pop de Szathmari, (Szathm\u00e1ry Pap K\u00e1roly) considered to be the world's first combat photographer and first world (known) combat reporter. Became the Romanian Royal House\u2019s (first?) official photographer. J\u00f3zsef Sebesty\u00e9n, created the interwar Romanian Coat of Arms on which the current one is based on. Vida G\u00e9za, who was a famous sculptor of the communist period. In the sports area, besides the ones mentioned already by Mr. Marinescu in his answer, I\u2019d like to add B\u00e9la and M\u00e1rta K\u00e1rolyi, who had significant results as head coaches of the Romanian Olympic Women\u2019s Gymnast team (most notably, Nadia Comaneci\u2019s first-ever perfect 10 in the 1976 Summer Montreal Olympics). They also trained Ecaterina Szabo (Szab\u00f3 Katalin) yet another great Romanian gymnast most famous for her tremendous effort at the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics. Moving on to footbal, one cannot forget that the 1986\u2019s European Champions\u2019 Cup Winners, Steaua Bucharest, besides being coached by a certain Emerich Jenei (Jenei Imre)it also featured another Hungarian ethnic, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00f6l\u00f6ni (considered one of the best Romanian footballers ever). Special mentions: 19th century\u2019s K\u00e1roly \u00c1cs (The Elder), Ko\u00f3s Ferenc or \u00c1rp\u00e1d Bitay\u2019s work did not influence Romanian modern (and folk) culture directly, but tried to expose Hungarians to it, by translating it into Hungarian. Same goes for Veress S\u00e1ndor (founder of the Romanian cartography) and his son, Veress Endre. Also I\u2019d like to add the Riman\u00f3czy architects, K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Sr. and his son, K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Jr. Again, their contribution is not intentional or direct, but my hometown would not look the way it looks today, without their work. PS: How could I forget Mr. Szabolcs Cseh, probably the best Romanian stuntman seen in Romanian films. (mainly pre-1990 ones). He established the first Romanian professional stuntmen team, while previously being the first professional fight coordinator (hired for that position) and has worked on probably every action scene in a Romanian film in the communist period and many afterwards (about 150+ films and TV projects).

            "answer_text": "There is an interesting confusion and overlapping in all this. Romanians tend to consider great athletes and other significant, high-profile people of Hungarian background, mother tongue and identity, living in Romania, as Romanians, sometimes as a compromise adding \u201cof Hungarian origin\u201d. This is why - to maintain the facade of the homogeneous Romanian nation-state - these people were forced, mostly against their will, to change their names to its Romanian version and Szab\u00f3 Katalin was known in the world as Ecaterina Szabo, Bal\u00e1zs Jol\u00e1n back in the 60s as Iolanda Balas, B\u00f6l\u00f6ni L\u00e1szl\u00f3 as Ladislau Boloni and Jenei Imre as Emerich Jenei, to name just a few. While - still maintaining that the borders of the Hungarian nation and state do not coincide - in Hungary by many they were considered as Hungarians and seen with a sympathy reserved usually for co-nationals. Romanians, however, also tend to think that the borders of the Romanian nation and state do not coincide, while covering all present day Romania they extend to neighboring countries, mostly to Moldova which has a significant Romanian(speaking) majority. These most Romanians consider as part of the Romanian nation, even if at present outside the actual state borders. (While, in somewhat contradicting terms they tend to reject the idea that, for example, the Szekely community, in the very middle of Romania, would in any sense be part of the Hungarian nation.) Quite confusing, is it not? ",
