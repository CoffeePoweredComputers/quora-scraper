            "answer_text": "Alexander was a compassionate leader, he would show respect to common people as he did a King. I believe, from the histories I have read of him, communication was to be true and loyal\u2026 I don\u2019t believe he even had hired men to do flattering, as so many rulers have done over the centuries. His father was a strategic military leader. Alexander would see his fathers military ethics and make his own set of military ethics when he would go to war. He was a part of the Calvary and fought alongside the men he respected and had a duty to be a good leader. He engaged in the cultural practices and traditions when he was in a foreign leaders empire as not to be seen as rude or malcontent towards the people who graciously invited and entertained his troops, warriors. A very well educated man we are sure of, as his teacher of the earth and sciences was Aristotle. The Nicomachean Ethics that Aristotle wrote shows in the way Alexander behaved,personal virtues and responsibilities of being a citizen\u2026Alexander extended his empire into India a remarkable feat for a man not even 30 years old at the time. He was born in Pella Macedonia and his mother loved him truly and wished his life success and happiness\u2026 he also loved his mother very much. When I read about her and his love for her I really started to like Alexander The Great, someone so admired and respected showed love and compassion to his mother\u2026 he did not try to rule her. Oh, and let\u2019s not forget Busephelous the black stallion Alexander rode in battle and showed kindness to when the horse was spooked by his shadow on the ground\u2026. It is only the sun. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on your definition of Great. Alexander the Great- was Alexander the III of Macedon. He was born in Pella, in Greece in 356 BC. He succeeded his father Philip the II- at the age of 20. Most of his life was spent on an unprecedented military campaign spanning from Greece to Northwestern India. Not only is- was he undefeated in battle- but is widely considered one of history\u2019s greatest military commanders. One immediate legacy was the rise of the Hellenistic Period. Essentially from his death - 300 years- would see some of the most fruitful periods. This also accounts for the failing states East of the Tigris- some which began failing prior to Alexander\u2019s death. Between the founding of cities and blending of cultures- such a mix was unheard of back then. ",
