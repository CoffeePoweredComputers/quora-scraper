            "answer_text": "Despite all the religious answers of the biblical tale storyline, I think it is worthy and moral to tell the truth. Sure some religious belief in a story sounds great in some answer and reasoning. But the fact is those are just claimed assumptions to some fairytale mythology of a story that is just made up. If one was to take a step out of religion and the or ideologicalism concepts and writings they created to fit the narratives they already believed in . If they were to step bbn out and study writings and records hy other numerous civilizations that lived in those same regions and that in some cases enemies to Egypt. There are no records of millions of Hebrew/Jewish slaves being kept in that time era . There was no exodus..there is no evidences of a group of people wandering in a desert area that was small enough that a person can cross that desert are in under 2 weeks. There is no evidences of a Moses. There is no records of a encounter to free any species slaves. There is no records of Egypt having any amount of that number of slaves of one particular group of people and according to factual historicity of records of Egypt and the surrounding civilizations who dealt with Egypt and as also traded and sold slaves to Egypt, that the hebrew jews were never slaves at that particular period of time to Egypt at all. Theres a huge difference between what a religion writes as their own historicity at a point literally thousands of years later and create it to be whatever they want it to be in narrative. And the actual demonstrable evidences and facts of proven historicity of those times. Literally, the Moses story never happened. ALL honest and true historians accept this as fact. Those who contend it are apologists and want and need these stories to be true..they are not being honest and sincere. They are letting beliefs and faith of religion get in the way of facts and demonstrable evidences of truth. They may be historians..but if your going to let a belief system get in the way of telling factual and demonstrable history..your not much of a historian..your more of just a story teller who wants a particular narrative belief told rather than what truth is.
