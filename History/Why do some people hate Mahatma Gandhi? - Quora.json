            "answer_text": "We can be sure, Gandhi was a lot of things. He certainly did some amazing things. He changed the very face of activism and civil disobedience forever, for instance, for which humanity owes the man a great deal of gratitude. Mahatma roughly translates as \u2018great soul\u2019. The man had a dark side, as do we all. You may decide yourself, if you still think him worthy of the title after knowing his dark side, which I\u2019ll write about a little here.  These girls above are Gandhi\u2019s great-nieces, the granddaughters of one of his siblings. He was unusually close to them, not in a \u201ckindly grandfather figure\u201d sort of way, but in an uncomfortably sexual way\u2026 Gandhi wanted to prove how virtuous he was, how pure. So he would ask the girls at night, to disrobe and strip naked, and sleep with him. He himself would also get naked, and hold them in his arms. His goal was not to get aroused; this frequently failed. Secondly, his goal was to not have sex with them. In this goal, it appears he succeeded. This practice started when Gandhi was in his seventies and the girls around fifteen or sixteen.  He would also have baths with them. Naked, of course. He would soap in their bodies, and wash them. Very, very thoroughly. Next, he\u2019d have the girls wash him as well. Again, to \u2018test his purity\u2019. Hollywood stars have been \u2018cancelled\u2019 for a lot less \u2014 Louis C.K. masturbated in front of women, which was nasty, but at least the women were adults. In Gandhi\u2019s case, his creepy little purity tests took place with girls who were, Underage at the time it started and,His own relatives, as he was their great-uncleIn an extra cruel twist, Gandhi had stopped having sex with his wife years prior. He considered her ugly and unattractive and compared her, rather viciously, to a \u2018cow\u2019. When she was already an elderly lady, she fell ill\u2026 doctors recommended using penicilline on her, but Gandhi advised her to not take it, distrusting Western medicine. She died of her illness\u2026 when he himself got sick not much later, Gandhi was offered the same medicine. He did not refuse, and survived the disease\u2026 I\u2019m not saying Gandhi isn\u2019t heroic, isn\u2019t good, wasn\u2019t a man of virtue in many ways but\u2026 his sexual life is creepy, and the way he treated his wife makes him come across as a total bastard. Definitely a mixed bag. ",

            "answer_text": "Though Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is regarded as \u201cMahatma\u201d or the great soul by most of the people in the Indian subcontinent but there are thousands of people in the subcontinent who hate Gandhi . The reasons why Mahatma Gandhi is not revered by these people are worth understanding as it gives a clear picture of the mindset of the Indian aam admi.  Unromantic ideas - The ideas of non violence and austerity are lofty . And more importantly they are boring and unromantic. Most young people cannot see rationale in these principles . They strongly believe that these principles are not practicable.Partially Politically motivated - The Indian National Congress has used the name of the Mahatma to cover up their sins. They have used the name \u201cGandhi\u201d year after year to run a democratic monarchy . It is obvious thus that political opponents of the INC would therefore try to smear and defame the name of Gandhi. Therefore the hatred is at least partially politically motivated.Partition of India - Partition of India was a sin committed by Indian National Congress and the Muslim League . Millions of people lost their lives in the exodus that followed the partition. Rape and murder were common place events . Mahatma Gandhi by stooping to the iron will and power lust of Mohammad Ali Jinnah was directly responsible for this holocaust . As a natural consequence he is hated. Murder (even when done with good intentions) is murder.Nathuram Godse and his speech - Nathuram Godse was not an eccentric as is claimed by most doctored and biased text books that are written about Gandhi . In fact he was very adept at articulation . He made a very zealous argument on the floor of the court justifying why he killed Gandhi. This statement was subsequently not released in public domain. When it was finally released(after a lot of legal struggle) it\u2019s content was distributed all over India . This content was absorbed very readily and his ideas spread like wild fire . This emotional speech is one of the fundamental reasons why Gandhi is hated.Personal front - Gandhi\u2019s obsession with celibacy was so much that it can be taken for perversion. In fact it may some of his \u201cexperiments\u201d were outright weird. Though I don\u2019t deny that there might have been some use of these experiments , most people would not be able to make much sense of it . And hence would brand him a pedophile and pervert.Hypocrisy- The following is an excerpt from pp. 167-169 of 100 THINGS YOU\u2019RE NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW by Russ Kick]GANDHI REFUSED TO LET HIS DYING WIFE TAKE PENICILLIN YET TOOK QUININE TO SAVE HIMSELFGandhi is often ranked, directly or subtly, alongside Jesus Christ and Martin Luther King Jr. as one of the greatest peacemakers \u2013 indeed, one of the greatest human beings \u2013 of all time. The mythology that surrounds him \u2013 which he built, leaving his followers, admirers, and hagiographers to reinforce and embellish \u2013 has almost completely smothered the many unflattering facts about him. In such a compact book, space doesn\u2019t permit a full exploration of Gandhi\u2019s numerous, consequential skeletons \u2013 his racism toward blacks and whites, his betrayal of the Untouchables, his acquiescence toward the Nazis. Instead let\u2019s focus on something more personal and, in some ways, more upsetting. In August 1942, Gandhi and his wife, Kasturba, among others, were imprisoned by the British in Aga Khan Palace, near Poona. Kasturba had poor circulation and she\u2019d weathered several heart attacks. While detained in the palace, she developed bronchial pneumonia. One of her four sons, Devadas, wanted her to take penicillin. Gandhi refused. He was okay with her receiving traditional remedies, such as water from the Ganges, but he refused her any medicines, including this newfangled antibiotic, saying that the Almighty would have to heal her. \u201cThe Life and Death of Mahatma Gandhi\u201d quotes him on February 19, 1944; \u201cIf God wills it, He will pull her through.\u201d \u201cGandhi: A Life\u201d adds this wisdom from the Mahatma: \u201cYou cannot cure your mother now, no matter what wonder drugs you may muster. She is in God\u2019s hands now.\u201d Three days later, Devadas was still pushing for the penicillin, but Gandhi shot back: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you trust God?\u201d Kasturba died that day. The next night, Gandhi cried out: \u201cBut how God tested my faith!\u201d He told one of Kasturba\u2019s doctors that the antibiotic wouldn\u2019t have saved her and that allowing her to have it \u201cwould have meant the bankruptcy of my faith.\u201d (Emphasis mine.) But Gandhi\u2019s faith wasn\u2019t much of an obstacle a short time later when it was his *** on the line. A mere six weeks after Kasturba died, Gandhi was flattened by malaria. He stuck to an all-liquid diet as his doctors tried to convince him to take quinine. But Gandhi completely refused and died of the disease, right? No, actually, after three weeks of deterioration, he took the diabolical drug and quickly recovered. The stuff about trusting God\u2019s will and testing faith only applied when his wife\u2019s life hung in the balance. When he needed a drug to stave off the Grim Reaper, down the hatch it went. This is just one example of his hypocrisy . The truth is that there are many more. Obscure statements - \u201cGandhi believed Indian women who were raped lost their value as human beings. He argued that fathers could be justified in killing daughters who had been sexually assaulted for the sake of family and community honor.\u201d There are many such examples of Gandhi \u2018s statement which demonstrate a high level of misogyny and racism. Hating him therefore is obvious.In conclusion I would like to say that though some of the movements like the Dandi March etc were great successes , most of Gandhian principles are too exalted for people to follow it . In some cases the principles were so exalted that Gandhi himself could not follow it . Presence of such principles are the root cause of the hate that Gandhi receives. ",
