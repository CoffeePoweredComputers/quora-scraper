            "answer_text": "Yes! Lincoln\u2019s Crimes He raised a huge army at his own will without the approval of Congress. He started a war of choice in violation of every principle of Christian just war teaching. He said that he had to violate the Constitution in order to save it. He declared the elected legislatures of thirteen States to be \u201ccombinations\u201d of criminals that he had to suppress. He said he was indifferent to slavery but would use any force necessary to collect taxes. He sent combat troops from the battlefield to bombard and occupy New York City. He sent the Army to arrest in the middle of the night thousands of private citizens for expressing their opinions. And held them incommunicado in military prisons with total denial of due process of law. And had his soldiers destroy newspaper plants. He was the first ruler in the civilized world to make medicine a contraband of war. He signed for his cronies special licenses to purchase valuable cotton from an enemy country even though he had forbidden such trade and punished other people for the same practice. He refused medical care and food to his own soldiers held by the enemy country. He presided over the bombardment and house-by-house destruction of cities and towns that were undefended and not military targets. His forces deliberately targeted women and children and destroyed their housing, food supply, and private belongings. His occupying forces engaged in imprisonment, torture, and execution of civilians and seizing them as hostages. Under him the Army had the largest number of criminals, mercenaries, and foreigners. He was the first American President to plot the assassination of an opposing head of state. He had the least affiliation with Christianity of any American President and blamed God for starting the war over which he presided. He voted for and praised a law which forbade black people from settling in his State. He said that all black people should be expelled from the United States because they could never be full-fledged citizens. He was the first to force citizens to accept as legal money pieces of paper unbacked by gold or silver. He was the first President to institute an income tax. He was the first President to pile up a national debt too vast to be paid off in a generation. ",

            "answer_text": "A fun question, but first we ought to define what a tyrant was. In modern usage, a tyrant is simply someone whom you feel is oppressing you, and breaking the law. John Locke also said a tyrant was a leader who acted against the law: \u201cWhere Law ends, Tyranny begins.\u201d However, we might ask Plato for his definition, per the Republic: \u201cHow then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant? \u2026 He begins to grow unpopular. \u2026 Then comes the famous request for a bodyguard, which is the device of all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career \u2013 \u2018Let not the people\u2019s friend,\u2019 as they say, \u2018be lost to them.\u2019 \u2026 The people readily assent; all their fears are for him \u2013 they have none for themselves. \u2026 And \u2026 the protector of whom we spoke, is to be seen \u2026 the overthrower of many, standing up in the chariot of state with the reins in his hand, no longer protector, but tyrant absolute. \u2026 The lion and serpent element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength.\u201d His point being that when the ruler begins declaring the need for soldiers to defend himself, his rule, and his nation (in that order) you have a tyrant. To that end, the framers defined the tyrant thus: \u201cIn time of actual war, great discretionary powers are constantly given to the Executive Magistrate. Constant apprehension of War, has the same tendency to render the head too large for the body. A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty. The means of defense against foreign danger have been always the instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended. Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.\u201d -James Madison, June 29 1787 So we should define a tyrant as: Someone (who labels themself a protector of the vulnerable) who desires a powerful army (both to protect them and their rule)Someone who constantly fearmongers on the need for a larger army - a standing army - to defend and ultimately to enslaveSomeone who eventually realizes they have such power that the laws no longer apply, what they want - they take.Let us now apply our test to Lincoln: Did he desire a powerful army to protect himself and his rule?Consider Fort Sumter, although he ordered the troops there not to return fire, he had also ordered a military buildup there - which the South Carolinians took to mean he intended to invade. This was Casus Belli. Lincoln then, on April 13th called for 75,000 troops at a time when Congress was not in session - a breach of the constitution - only Congress has that power.On May 3, 1861 he called for ever more troops, this time with 3-year retainers without regard to the will of congress.Did he fearmonger for a perpetually larger army?April 21, 1861 - Lincoln instructed the navy to buy 5 more vessels for a blockade - neither the aqcuisition nor the blockade were approved by congress.Did he eventually believe himself beyond the lawApril 27, 1861 - Lincoln suspended Habeas CorpusHe subsequently ignored Ex Parte Merryman which declared him in contempt of the constitution.According to Lincoln\u2019s bodyguard - Ward Hill Lamon, he then issued an arrest warrant for Taney, though it was never delivered, the authenticity of this claim is unknown though many of the newspapers he followed proposed the move.Lincoln arrested over 14,000 political prisoners - many without even listing charges, let alone trials. Including the Grandson of Francis Scott Key who later wrote American Bastille on the topic.The Lincoln Administration and Arbitrary Arrests: A ReconsiderationLincoln had his troops stationed in Maryland intimidate voters, and cast votes themselves to sway the November elections in 1861Lincoln shuttered over 300 Northern Newspapers and imprisoned their editors/writers during the war.His \u201cdefense\u201d: \u201cMeasures, however unconstitutional, might become lawful by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the Constitution, through the preservation of the nation.\u201dLincoln issued the Emancipation Proclomation, despite being told by his council that states and not the Federal had jurisdiction over the issue as per the 10th Amendment - he told them it did not matter.As a result he was able to impress (meaning, re-enslave) over 186,000 fleeing southern slaves of which 68,000 died in Union Slavery.Lincoln Nationalized the railroads - an unconstitutional seizure - and ran them during the war.So rather than answer a question, I\u2019d rather ask whether you think these are the actions of a tyrant, or not? And if not, what further action would you require in order for it to be? Something else you may find interesting, the Roman Imperators were not considered to be Dictators in their own time, but rather the \u201cdefenders of the republic\u201d it was only from the outside that they were diagnosed as having despots. And the obligatory quote from the founders: \u201cRebellion to tyrants is obediance to God.\u201d -Benjamin Franklin ",
