Since it was sold to it current owner, AOL has degraded its email, torn away all spam filters for blocking email, as the former filters do not exist. It\u2019s stripped. Its overall quality is very poor, as everybody is only using 20% of it anymore. News items are poor. NEWS items have a slideshow with ads in our faces yet WE ARE PAYING for email WITH ADS on EVERY PAGE, EVERY EMAIL, EVERY NEWS ITEM. Most of us who started with AOL very early, have our long time known screen names for our friends, for business and because it has NO spam filters, MY email has taken 3 years to cultivate spam filters and I had to download that myself. AOL HAS BECOME WORSE THAN ANY FREE EMAIL SERVICE. THE NEW OWNER OF AOL HAS RUINED THE ENTIRE SERVICE. ",
