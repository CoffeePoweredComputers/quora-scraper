            "answer_text": "Although \u201cHinduism\u201d is recognized worldwide as a \u201creligion\u201d, it is better not to view it as a religion, otherwise you get everything wrong, just as this question does. Hindu traditions are spiritual traditions. Spirituality is the \u201cdefault state of being\u201d of all humans, it is the \u201chuman condition\u201d or \u201cstate of mind\u201d. Hindu philosophy is an exploration into the state of the mind and its complexity, why we think, speak and behave the way we do, what is character or personality, what qualities are desirable in humans that makes them trustworthy or otherwise, and so on. And its focus is on developing the mind \u201cinfinitely\u201d. It is why it is entirely about the practices. The texts are important sources of reference information of the experiences of others who have gone down this path in exploring the mind, broken through to reach a state of infinite wisdom, infinite bliss. It is the ancient traditions of messiahs and prophets, however, knowledge that can easily be misrepresented by the deceitful to manipulate the na\u00efve. We are all born with all the tools we need to have a personal compact with our God, and no institution (like the Church, for example) should ever change that order of the universe. ",
