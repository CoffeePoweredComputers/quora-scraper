            "answer_text": "Reagan was a very likable guy in real life, his fellow actors, directors, and others in the entertainment industry liked him. He was down earth and treated people he did business with fairly, and seemed unaffected by his fame and fortune. He was elected the head of the actors union for several terms. He was also a very patriotic American, as were the majority of his post WWII generation. He felt his democratic party was drifting from fundamental American beliefs and values and became a Republican. In spite of this he remained liked and respected by his peers. He was elected governor of California twice during which time he successfully reformed California\u2019s Welfare system, that stopped the sharp growth and reduced welfare by 300,000 people while at the same time providing increased benefits to those that actually needed them. He reduced spending, and increased taxes to balance the enormous deficit budget. The average citizen was doing much better, and the economy was improved and climbing. He promised to apply the same fix to the federal government, and after the disastrous Carter years had similar success earning him two terms as president. He brought about the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, he strengthened the military, and responded decisively against terrorism. He was a brilliant and inspirational public speaker, the media referred to him as \u201cThe Great Communicator,\u201d and this contributed to his growing popularity. So those are some of the reasons people liked him so much. ",

            "answer_text": "People liked former President Reagan so much because our country enjoyed a time of great prosperity under his administration. Our standard of living and quality of life were tremendous during those eight years. Unprecedented! There had been a malaise in our country prior to Reagan taking office and then when he took office that malaise lifted. People were proud of our country again. Americans were happier then than they were at any other time in the last fifty years! You could see it all around you. Of course, we had a big problem at the time he took office; The threat of nuclear armageddon! The USSR had told us: \u201cWe will bury you\u201d! They literally wanted to run the world. Well, we weren\u2019t going to have that, and with Ronald reagan leading the way, we won The Cold War without a single missile ever needing to be fired. It was a remarkable accomplishment! The Berlin Wall came down! Do you know how Reagan did it? He did it by bankrupting the Soviets. He knew they would try to keep up with us in the arms race, but of course they wouldn\u2019t be able to because they didn\u2019t have a strong enough economy to match our spending. Why? Because their economy was built on the faulty premise that communism works! Ha ha ha! It didn\u2019t work for anyone prior to the USSR and has not worked for anyone since. I have a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Business, I had to take economics classes as part of my college curriculum, and I have an excellent understanding of why that is so. I won\u2019t try to condense four years of college education into this answer. I don\u2019t think that would be especially productive, but I can leave you with with the two basic ideas that are the foundation of our economic system: Incentive is good! When people know that if they work with hard and smart they will get rewarded for it, then productivity goes up! People will work as hard and as intelligently as they can, just so long as they have reason to believe they will be rewarded for it.Competition is good! By having a multitude of businesses in any given industry all competing with each other to try to provide the best product for the consumer at the lowest price, the consumers are the winners! They get the best quality products for the lowest possible price! That\u2019s something communists never understood. Oh well, it\u2019s their loss.",
