            "answer_text": "The most important thing about 7 wonders of the world is that they are WONDERS.Their mind blowing architecture, planning and its implementation in a non-technical era is itself a surprising fact.Just think about it can you find another great wall of China in the world ,another macchu pichu,another great pyramid in any part of the world.This are just some of the examples,think about the remaining wonders of the world.This were made centuries before and still they are all OK,they were made in such a time, when there was no machine for construction, implementation and still such marvellous architecture were built. There are many wonders in the world, we select only seven ,but each and every wonder of the world has certain story,certain science and also certain mysteries.That's what I think about the wonders of the world,and I hope that in near future, I will be able to visit each and every wonder of the world ",

When people hear that I am from Las Vegas they ask me all about MY city. I saw all of mine in less than three years and spent three weeks in India, Three weeks in China and at LEAST a week in all the others. To celebrate my last one - Christ the Redeemer Statue in Rio, I spent five days in a five star hotel ON THE BEACH in Ipanima in the middle of January. ",
