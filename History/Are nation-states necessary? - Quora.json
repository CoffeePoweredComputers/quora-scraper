            "answer_text": "The experience of federal states like Canada, the United States and Switzerland, among others, do tend to indicate that some form of local control is the best for all concerned.  As such, attempting to have a one \"unified world government\" is probably a bad idea for several reasons:- There's no reason to try to go with one legal system.  There are a few basic legal systems and, alhtough they work differently, the people who use them are generally happy with them.- It does make it easier to deal with language differences.  Even in Canada, federal laws have to be written in both English and French, but the laws of most provinces don't have to be.  Law is particularly hard to translate and there are many cases where the English and French texts don't match.- There's a good reason for local government; it makes it easier to get in touch with your politicians.  I've been to Toronto City Hall and Queens Park (Ontario's legislature) more times than I can count, but far away Ottawa only a few times and the United Nations even fewer times.  - As the Eurozone has shown, different regions have different borrowing needs.  Having multiple government borrowers and currencies can often be a good idea. ",

Nations who feel oppressed in their state should be (and often, do) gain independence. All those together make it likely that most states will end up with a nation forming a strong majority. ",

Examples would be pretty much all European and Asian countries except China are all based on ethnicity and culture, America is a nation state by that definition because Americans do not identify as an ethnicity and their country is not based on culture, but on nationality, they identify by their political ideology, not ethnicity, China is the same by the way despite the fact that their gov. is actively trying to create the idea of a single Chinese ethnic identity. So in that sense, sooner or later, all countries will become \u2018\u2019nation states\u2019\u2019 because a single ethnicity will no longer exist. ",
