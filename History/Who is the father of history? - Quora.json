            "answer_text": "Leopold van Rahnke, an Austrian professor and philosopher who developed the idea of history as a science is the \u201cfather of history\u201d. He created the way history is written as provable beyond some measure of doubt. Many people today still try to refute his work because they want history to be written to make a point or support ideology, not to reflect actual events. Fox News is an example of an organization that constantly tries to create history based on ideology instead of the \u201cfacts\u201d and people who talk of \u201calternative facts\u201d are also trying to create their own history. von Rahnke said there were three kinds of history. The first was the event as it happened and the truth of that is lost forever. The second is the painstaking recreation of the truth through tested sources, cited, reliable evidence and reporting and the tested veracity of the reporters. The third type of history is what we read in the history books and that is mostly lies and legend established by people in power who want to sway opinion or change the way things are believed in the future. For example, the Republicans in Texas forcing textbook writers to refer to \u201cslaves\u201d in the American South as \u201cforeign workers\u201d is an attempt to change history by creating an image in the minds of students about what happened in the South. In the end, most people are more interested in their own personal version of history than in what actually happened and will alter history to suit their agenda. This is why Howard Zinn\u2019s \u201cHistory of the People of the United States\u201d is so reviled, especially by the right wing. It strives to report the actual events through cited research, and not the legend. No one wants the truth. It hurts their agenda too much. Leopold von Ranke - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Herodotus is traditionally regarded as the father of history. He was a Greek historian who was born in Halicarnassus in thePersian Empire(modern-dayBodrum,Turkey) and lived in the fifth century BC (c.484\u2013c. 425 BC), a contemporary of Thucydides,Socrates, and Euripides. He is often referred to as \"The Father of History\", a title first conferred byCicero;he was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigation\u2014specifically, by collecting his materials systematically and critically, and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative. \u201cThe Histories\u201d is the only work which he is known to have produced, a record of his \"inquiry\" on the origins of theGreco-Persian Wars; it primarily deals with the lives of Croesus,Cyrus,Cambyses,Smerdis,Darius, and Xerxes and the battles of Marathon,Thermopylae,Artemisium,Salamis,Plataea, andMycale; however, its many cultural,ethnographical, geographical,historiographical, and other digressions form a defining and essential part of the Histories and contain a wealth of information.Some of his stories are fanciful and others inaccurate, yet he states that he is reporting only what he was told; a sizable portion of the information he provided was later confirmed by historians and archaeologists. Despite Herodotus's historical significance, little is knownof his personal life.  Herodotus announced the size and scope of his work at the beginning of hisResearchesorHistories: Here are presented the results of the enquiry carried out by Herodotus ofHalicarnassus. The purpose is to prevent the traces of human events from being erased by time, and to preserve the fame of the important and remarkable achievements produced by both Greeks and non-Greeks; among the matters covered is, in particular, thecause of the hostilities between Greeks and non-Greeks. \u2014\u2009Herodotus,The Histories Robin Waterfield translation (2008) Courtesy: WIKIPEDIA ",
