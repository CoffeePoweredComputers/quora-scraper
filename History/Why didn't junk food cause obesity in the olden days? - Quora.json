            "answer_text": "Well it depends on what you call junk food.  I am 60 years old.  In my life I have seen the invention of junk food.  I recall eating at McDonalds not long after the chain went national. Burgers were $.15.  So junk food was pretty much invented in the 1960's and onward. It might come to shock to you, but what we eat, underwent a profound and irrevocable change in the 1960's.  You would in a million years never guess what singular event changed it.  It had nothing to do with the food industry, or the FDA.  It had to do with the Federal Highway Authority.  It was the beginning of the construction of the Interstate Highway system.   Before that transportation arterial system was built the different regions of the US had their own cuisine and food heritage, because the US developed from a subsistence farm culture.  Each family in each region, grew, hunted, fished or picked their own food and fed themselves.  There were no national supermarket chains or chains of restaurants. The government in an effort to capture a history of these regional eating habits and employ out of work writers, undertook a program during the Great Depression.  Writers were sent out to gather information and write on the subject, documenting the eating habits and customs of some arbitrarily drawn regional areas. The project was never completed (like so many other things undertake by the government) because something called WWII happened along. So the manuscripts were placed in the National Archives until an enterprising food writer called Mark Kurlansky found out about it. He edited the manuscripts into a shorter version and had it published.  It is called Food From a Former World: how America ate before the Interstate Highway System.   It is an interesting read, some parts are better than others.  It contains old recipes, documents things like the New England Clam Bake, the Texas Beef Barbeque, Deep South corn meal based dishes, Pacific Northwest Salmon dishes and others.The Food of a Younger Land: A portrait of American food- before the national highway system, before chainres taurants, and before frozen food, when the nation's foodwas seasonal, regional, : Mark Kurlansky: 9781594484575: Amazon.com: Books The thing is it will enlighten you to the diversity of cuisine, a lot of which still exists but is on the verge of extinction due to the deluge of fast food travesties of chain restaurants, and fusion cooking with other styles. One man's junk food is another man's meat.  I call just about everything not cooked in my own kitchen by me or my wife, junk food.  Don't think that just because you buy it at a \"reputable\" chain restaurant or food purveyor like Boston Market, that it isn't junk food.   They all make it as cheap as they can, and cut as many corners as they can, to maximize profit.   I ran a catering business and know what the large national food suppliers sell.  Their prepackaged stuff is inexpensive...why?  Because they use the most expensive ingredients?  Hardly. I recall getting cheese cakes for under $6 a pop in cartons of two.  The markup on chain restaurant food is mindboggling.  Its the labor that is expensive. However if you are talking about \"junk food\" as in candy, chips, sodas, basically everything you can get in convenience store, then I have a few things to say about why kids are obese today. 1) we had PE in school through high school. 2) we played outside till dark.  Summers it was from sun up till after sundown.  Usually till 10pm.  We played things like Kick the Can.  Even as teenagers we went places, walked or biked.  We did not sit on our cell phones or in front of a computer. 3) Our parents did not restrict our movements out of fear.  Some kind of national hysteria has sprung up about kids and abduction. Either we were a lot smarter or kids have gotten a lot dumber about strangers and places they should or should not go. 4) Sodas were a treat, not a replacement for water.  The average can of soda contains the equivalent of about 3/4 of a cup of sugar.  It does not take a genius to know what that means if you drink 3-4 of those a day.  This alone probably explains why diabetes is at epidemic proportions. 5) Our mothers fed us, not major corporations or other strangers.  Our mothers fed us like their mothers fed them.  Usually wholesome nutritious food, made with their hands, or at least cooked with their hands.  I recall my grandmother making all of her own bread.  We had fresh fruit, strawberries, grapes, peaches, pears, apples, or pastries made by mom or grandmother from then for dessert.   That was our junk food.   My mother made my lunch or I ate cafeteria all through school.  6) Intake of fast food was minimal.  I recall eating McD's or other chain fast food when we were on the road between military duty stations Only.   The only exception was going to the Tasty Freeze to get soft served ice cream cones.  Most store bought sweets were a treat, not a staple. Bottom line.  We as kids were active, and we were not allowed to eat a lot of crap. Case in point.  In high school at six feet I weighted 160 lbs and it was only when I started working out, running that I put on muscular weight.  My brother, who was 15 years younger than me.  Was only 5 when my father retired from the military and settle down in one place.  My brother when he graduated high school weighed in excess of 300lbs at 6'1\".  The only difference between the two of us, was he was born in 1970, and I was born in 1955. He lived his life in the midst of the junk food revolution.  Chips, sodas, candy, and other crap was readily available.  He got a lot of it at home, things we could not afford on the family budget back when I was a kid, were readily available at home for him.  Ice cream every night, sodas when he wanted them.  Fast food just down the street. Last word is Americans are too trusting of the food industry by far.  The recent Bluebell Ice Cream debacle is evidence of that.  They trust doctors the same way, and neither are deserving of it.  They are all driven by the same thing, money.  Americans trust that everything they put in their mouths is wholesome, nourishing and good for them.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.   The mantra of the food makers is, cheaper, faster, more profitable.  Why replace sugar with high fructose corn syrup?  Its less expensive and tastes more intensely sweet than sugar.  No matter that it has been proven more harmful to your health.  Why push grains, grains, grains and more grains?  Because our national economy depends on it and we pay millions in farm subsidies to grow all that grain. America started getting fatter the moment we started pushing more carbs, carbs in its many forms, down our collective throats.  Do this little check:  take a look at your chain restaurant plate, or fast food bag.  Bet you will see this:  bread, potatoes in one form or another, flour breading, and noodles.  You will see them all or part of them, in every serving.  How much fresh fruit, or vegetables do you see if you don't order it special?  Of course that salad will contain bread croutons, and you'll get all the breadsticks or warm baked bread you can stuff down.  Carbs, carbs, carbs. Don't get me wrong, I love bread and carbs in the form of vegetables, I just do not like my meals made up of 70% white starchy carbs. So the reasons are pretty clear.  It is a problem today because of personal choices on the one hand and the food industry on the other. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Junk Food\" and the fast food industry is relatively new. I can recall in the 1960's having my first Macdonald's Burger. It cost $.15 and was about four inches across, the patty was about 1/4 inch thick, and it had catsup, mustard and pickles on it. I think we got fries, which were small. The combo probably had less calories than its current contemporary.Back then fast food was not a way of life, it was a treat. Most families still at dinner at home. Mom's sent kids to school with brown bag lunches, or you ate the cafeteria hot lunch.The invasion of fast food into daily culture was just beginning. To get a wide eye opening view of the changes wrought over the last fifty years you need to read the book, \"Food of a Younger Land: How America ate before the Interstate Highway system.\" It is by Mark Kurlansky https://www.amazon.com/Food-Younger-Land-portrait-American/dp/1594484570/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1476107762&sr=8-1&keywords=food+of+a+younger+land The book is edited from writings commissioned by the WPA during the Depression to keep writers employed. It gives a glimpse of how the Americans in the different regions cooked and ate before the highway system built post war II knitted all the parts of the US together in one homogenous whole. It is hard to think about a US without nationwide chain restaurants or fast food joints. When you traveled to Oregon from Georgia, the menu you saw at the local cafe might be a bit baffling to you. Not so today. What you get a Mc'ds or Burger King is the same from coast to coast. Chilis or Taco Bell serve up the same thing in LA as they do in Portland Maine. So with all this convenience at your finger tips and tongues, is it any wonder that people probably eat out two times a day if not more? I have been cooking for myself for 45 years starting when I was 16 years old. I cooked in college for me and my roommates and for three wives. I rarely eat out and when I do its a treat. Sadly, like yesterday, it is generally a disappointment. I took my wife out for brunch, and the food was pitiful. Not only was it cold when we got it, the coffee was weak, the omelet was overcooked, and the has browns soggy and cold. The pancake was good, but the warm syrup already had a skin over it. When we go out we usually end up figuring we wasted our money because we could do it better and cheaper at home, which is why we rarely eat out and nearly never eat junk food. On my way to the gym in the morning I see cars already lined up at the local burger joint drive thru that serves breakfast. Americans are addicted to lousy convenient food. My daughter in law only recently realized how much money she wasted on fast food and began cooking at home.So couple the high calories of fast food, with the relative inactivity and sedentary lifestyles most Americans have you get obesity. There are a lot of variables involved that people do not factor in. Fifty years ago, central air conditioning at home or in the workplace was not a given. I went to school until the 1970's in un air conditioned buildings. We expect to and generally live our lives in an environment dialed in at around 76 degrees F. Now I ask you, how hungry are you when its 85 degrees? We do not on average want to be hauling around a full heavy gut when its relatively warm or hot outside. But if its cool, and comfortable we tend to overeat. Couple that with the real or imagined fears we inflict on ourselves that prevent us from letting our kids be kids and run around outside and play. Instead they veg out in front of the TV, video games, tablets or phones. I venture that kids today have less than 10% of the playtime imagination of kids the same age 50 years ago. They get all their entertainment served up to them on a platter. When was the last time you saw kids building a fort or playhouse in the yard with a box a refrigerator came in? Probably never. Now add to those things the concentrated industrialized substances we now call fast food and you have what you see today. Did you know that some fries are sprayed with a sugar solution which crisps and browns them in the fryer? We all know about the protein slime that is added to some so called beef patties. Industrialized foods have all manner of additives, flavorings and other substances added to make it more palatable and less expensive to make. \"Cane sugar? We don't need no stinking cane sugar!\" Nope, industry discovered high fructose corn syrup is less expensive and is actually sweeter than cane sugar. No matter that is horrible for you, people still guzzle it down by the quart in sodas and just about everything else that is sweet including so called \"sports drinks.\" When I ate brunch yesterday, I watched a family get in their car. The parents in their mid to late thirties were each probably sixty pounds over weight. Mom was as big around as she was tall, dad was not far behind. The saddest part were the kids: boy, probably ten or twelve already had a gut hanging over his belt, and his younger sister looked to be 25 pounds overweight too. That would be about 50% of her normal weight. Same for the boy, who probably should have weighed maybe 75-80 lbs, but probably weighted 100lbs or more. I know how it works, I had a morbidly obese brother who at 21 weighted over 300lbs. At his age I weighed 175lbs. What was the difference? Fast food. He was 15 years younger than me, did not cook and when he was hungry raided the refrigerator. When my parents tried to limit what he ate, he drove down to the dairy queen and wolfed down a few burgers and fries. His weight did not get him a tree and a drunk driver did. So I will never know it his fork would have killed him or not. I would bet on the fork though. ",
