            "answer_text": "As a former Librarian (I know better than most) that categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Of necessity Librarians study Boolean Logic because it is an essential tool for an understanding of Library Classification and Cataloguing and the design and construction of search engines a basic tool for the conduct of research. In this digital age (as I understand it) a basic understanding of Boolean Logic is now taught in Secondary School; Information and Communications Technology, Information Science, Computer Science and Mathematics courses. In a nutshell Boolean Operators are the and/or/not search terms which researchers use to broaden or narrow a search of a computerised database in order to generate the desired number of \u201chits\u201d, in a target range : if your search is too broad you end up with too much information (information overload) conversely if your search is too narrow you end up missing useful information and if you get it just right you end up with just the right amount of information for an 80,000 word thesis or an 800 word essay or term paper. Too return to the subject of your question about history, useful and essential are not mutually exclusive categories (logically speaking) something which is essential is an absolute necessity, it is more than merely useful, to take an example some form of engine to provide motive power for an automobile is essential, whereas a spare wheel and jack are merely useful, you may be able to get by without them if you carry a mobile (cell) phone and have breakdown cover. If history is an essential tool for understanding society it goes beyond being a merely useful tool to being an absolute necessity. Where do I stand on the debate about whether History is a useful discipline or one which is absolutely essential? I would have to say that History is paradoxical : on the one hand it is possible for societies to make some progress with out an understanding of history, on the other it is a demonstrable fact that such societies only make limited progress before they breakdown and regress. I would have to say that George Santayana hit the nail on the head when he sagely observed that, \u201cThose who cannot learn from History are doomed to repeat it.\u201d q.v.
