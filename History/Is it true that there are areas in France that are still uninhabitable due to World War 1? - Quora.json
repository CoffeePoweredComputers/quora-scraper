Though the war has been over for nearly 102 years as of this writing, it is still hard to imagine the scale of it and the impact it had on Europe from an American perspective that largely forgot it. In areas of northern France there are areas called Zone Rouge or \u201cRed Zones\u201d that are considered to be to dangerous for humans to live or work. And while reduced from what they once were, it is believed it will take between 300\u2013700 years to clean them. Unexploded bombs and mines, dangerous chemicals, human and animal remains and other things still exist as a hazard. In some places 99% of plants still die from Arsenic poisoning. In France and Belgium ever year there is still the \u201ciron harvest\u201d of remains of shells, bullets, barbed wire and other bits are turned up. Things that may still be \u201clive\u201d are carefully placed in slots in utility poles so that the military can collect them and destroy them safely. There are also many villages who \u201cdied for France\u201d in the fighting that have never been rebuilt or annexed by other settlements, but whose memories are kept alive.

            "answer_text": "Great Question! Yes, there are areas that are not habitable, also called in French the Red Zone, or Zone Rouge. After the First World War came to an end in 1918, the French made 12000 sq km of Verdun uninhabitable and too costly to rehabilitate due to their lack of funding at the time.  Even though nobody lives in the Red Zone, the French still recognizes the villages that were destroyed within the zone to be municipalities. They even have their own \u201cdesignated mayors who receive government money to receive guests and preserve the memory of what\u2019s left\u201d(The nine ghost villages of northern France)  In this area, you can find exploded shells with gas, undetonated grenades, ammunitions, polluted soil with toxins and human remains, chemical plants, two arsenic filled plots of land with a 99 percent plant mortality rate.  In Fact, people find bombs from the war all around France today. There was a massive harvest that led to a huge finding of bombs around French grounds. Also, I would like to note that Verdun is actually close to Paris! Only two hours or so! It\u2019s pretty crazy that Paris sits only a few miles away from WW1 plagued battle fields.
