            "answer_text": "It all had to do with trade. The Silk Road was long and treacherous, but sea routes were faster and more cargo could be carried than if pack animals were used. The Portuguese and Spanish took the lead in searching for new routes, with Spain trying to reach China via the Atlantic, thus discovering the wealth of the new world, and the Portuguese reaching China and India by passing the southern tip of Africa. They were aided by innovations in ship building. Before, ships were designed for Mediterranean voyages, but new innovations produced ships that could brave the rough Atlantic waters enabling long term voyages. These innovations didn't reach the stubborn Atlantic shipwrights until much later allowing Spain and Portugal to open new trade routes and colonies with little competition. Unfortunately exploration for its own sake wasn't the main motivator until later, as always it comes down to making money. ",
