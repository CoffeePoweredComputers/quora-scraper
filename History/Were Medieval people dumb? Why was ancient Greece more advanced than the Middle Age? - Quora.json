            "answer_text": "In the ancient world, if you asked someone, \u201cwhat lies west of Persia?\u201d the answer would\u2019ve been the Mediterranean Sea. In Latin, the sea between two lands. Greece was somewhat removed from the rest of the ancient world, and Rome even more so! If you knew anything about the lands north of Macedonia, it was rumor and legend. Even so, I don\u2019t think the medieval Europeans were dumber than Ancient Greeks. England\u2019s merchant ship navy in the Hundred Years\u2019 War was unimpressive, but let\u2019s put them against the worlds biggest rowboat. And the Greek land is rugged, so Northern fields will feed soldiers better. And pants are actually a good idea. Did I mention ancient ships sink when the wind blows? It\u2019s important to remember that most of the time, a stable, rigid state can best a smarter but less sturdy one. The president can buy an atom bomb but YOUR country can buy an election. If ancient Northern Europe was less out of the way and Greece were landlocked, history would have been different! ",
