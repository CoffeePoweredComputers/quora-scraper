            "answer_text": "Millions and millions, between massacres, retaliation, famines, mismanagement, imperialist warmongering, forced conquest, vengeance, repression and other causes\u2026 If you think about the british empire as an empire, then the period it spanned being such is long, nearly three centuries, and for the most part of that time, it was a very brutal and opressive regime worldwide. As a whole, it caused directly or indirectly many, many, many deaths, with estimates ranging in millions, but there's no systematic way of knowing the real number in our modern days. The period is long, the geographical range is wide, and their imperialist attitude was often atrocious, so you get to read about american settlers and the near wiping out of native americans, just as you get to read about enslaved, humilliated or murdered australian aborigins, africans, islanders, and even some asians, especially in India, all of them victims of the britons. If you count intereuropean imperial warfare, quite a lot of european people died by their hands too. Being the largest empire in history, lasting that long, and not being precisely the most humane and not quite the most magnanimous or well tempered, you may as well expect a large list of crimes, atrocities, horrors, and their respective denial attempts thrown by britons to avoid giving off a bad image and mostly to prevent paying reparations for the trouble caused. That said, unless you're naive enough to think western colonists were really benign with their colonized populations apart from the privileged treatment given to their own settlers abroad, it seems to me this empire was quite a bloody mess, and that's why I never liked it. I'm speaking English even though it's not my native tongue, so that must speak about their influence, but I'm not british thankfully and as such I don't need to feel pride about their gritty past, and that's why I can judge from afar, and be free to state that the british empire is my least favorite empire in history, and that I just like the language, which existed before it, and evidently outlasted it, being a bit more useful to the world than their historical crimes.

            "answer_text": "The short answer is that it is unclear. According to the Indian columnist Bhaskar Menon, the British Empire 'killed with famine, sword and fire more people than Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun, Hitler or Stalin. In the defense of its imperial interests it has precipitated two World Wars and is now presiding over an empire of crime that drains the poorest countries of their hard-earned wealth. During the days of Empire and now, treachery has been a staple in Britain's international relations'. See: http://archive.larouchepac.com/node/25632 The British journalist Johann Hari writing in The Independent in 2006 argued that Britain possibly killed up to 29 million Indians in the late nineteenth century alone:http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-the-truth-our-empire-killed-millions-404631.html This claim has been disputed by a number of leading historians, but The Independent has effectively repeated the claim in its list of the five worst atrocities carried out by the British Empire (2016): http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/worst-atrocities-british-empire-amritsar-boer-war-concentration-camp-mau-mau-a6821756.html Interestingly, an article in another British newspaper The Guardian, has pointed out that many people in Britain are simply not aware of the Empire's past because they are not taught about it: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/23/british-empire-crimes-ignore-atrocities It must be said that many empires behaved this way, and the British are not an exception. While the British Empire contributed positively to the world in a number of ways, it also had many negative impacts on history, countries and peoples - it was heavily involved in the Atlantic slave trade for one, used concentration camps, brutally supressed uprisings at times, etc. Most large empires will have blood on their hands to varying degree, whether it is through conquest, colonisation, the implementation of rule, control of the colony, or suppression of the people and opposition. Inevitably, given that the British Empire was the largest in history and that it existed from the sixteenth century into the twentieth century, the activities and policies of the Empire would have resulted in the deaths of many people - I doubt you could put an exact figure on it.
