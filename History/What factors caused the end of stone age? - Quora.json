            "answer_text": "I taught a course in college called \u201cHistory of the Personal Computer\u201d. One of the questions I constantly asked my students was: \u201cSo, is it here where the PC revolution started?\u201d, and the landmarks were many: The Altair, the Apple II, the IBM PC, the Mac, the Internet\u2026. and the funny thing is, in every case, the answer was \u201cNo!\u201d History doesn\u2019t switch from one era to the next one in one day. Historians need to put a reference point in order to set up some parameters to explain the changes. But those paramenters are arbitrary and by concensus. Even in many places, as today, people are still in the Stone Age. So, we Homo Sapiens discovered metals, and learned how to work them. And that killed the Stone Age, right? Wrong! For a long time, we humans combined our use of stone tools and metal tools, overlapping both technologies. Some cultures mastered metal work, while others kept working with stones, improving over the work on it. So, consensus tells us the Stone Age ends when humans started building metal tools, starting with copper. The fact is, we kept combining copper with stone for tools. We moved to bronze and iron, and even then, stone was still a thing. So, in certain ways, it never ended. We still use stones for certain things, and as I mentioned, some cultures remain in the Stone Age. The so called \u201cend\u201d is just a parameter for us to understand dramatic changes in the human\u2019s staus quo. ",

            "answer_text": "The main reason the stone age ended was agriculture. Humans had always known that seeds terminate when planted, so they put this knowledge to use. This combined with the domestication and migration outside of africa led to the end of the stone age. These small neolithic settlements later grew into large cities and kingdoms and centralized government, specialization of labor, food surplusses, and trade led to the rise of the first civilizations in the fertile crescent.
