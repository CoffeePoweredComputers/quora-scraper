NeighborhoodScout\u2019s Murder Capitals of America \u2013 2020 Jan 2, 2020 | by: Dr. Andrew Schiller | Crime  Countdown of the Top 30 Cities in the U.S. with the Highest Murder Rates \u2013 2020 The murder capital of America isn\u2019t Chicago, but it is in Illinois for the second straight year. With nearly one murder per 1,000 residents, this year\u2019s murder capital is East St. Louis, IL and has a murder rate 17.5 times the national average, and 4 times Chicago\u2019s murder rate. Louisiana has the highest number of murder capitals on the list with 4. Jackson, MS fell off the list this year with a pretty impressive drop from 60 to 37 homicides and a significant decrease in the overall violent crime rate. No cities in the entire New York-New England region or the western U.S. made the list. Big cities and small, our crime research reveals the 30 cities in America with the highest number of murders per 1,000 residents. Murder is the willful (non-negligent) killing of one human being by another. We limited our research to cities with 25,000 or more people. Data used for this research are the number of murders reported to have occurred in each city, and the population of each city. Crime data we use are the most recent data the FBI classifies as \u2018Final, non-preliminary.\u2019 It is the most up-to-date and fully vetted data with complete national coverage that is available. We insist on using Final, Non-Preliminary data for our analyses and analytics, rather than basing our research on preliminary data that may need to be updated or have errors in it. Based on the latest national data available at the time of publication, representing calendar year 2018 and released in September 2019, this report reveals interesting patterns about crime and murder in America. Click on any city in the list below to see a full crime report and neighborhood crime map. For more information, see our FAQ on how we rank the cities with the highest murder rates in America.
