Scratched the surface for sure, but no one here ever thought we wouldn\u2019t be back. Physically, we have scars. You have to see the big picture. Katrina hit in August of 2005. I think the last body recovered was in March of 2006. There was a lot to do. In the months to a year after Katrina, there was cleanup. We had the pleasure to host tourists who simply wanted to come and spend money in our economy to help us back up. The next few years were rebuilding. Most of what was destroyed was rebuilt. There are some places that didn\u2019t recover as well as others. There was a bit of contraction. Some things moved - a few schools relocated, some businesses. The Lower Ninth Ward has a swath that was not rebuilt, not because it wasn\u2019t OK to rebuild, but simply because the owners couldn\u2019t afford to rebuild. So even today there are stairs standing that used to be in front of a home that no longer exists. But we have grown as a city. Economically we were back to being pretty good before COVID-19 hit. We had a lot of young people move to town in the aftermath of Katrina. Gentrification isn\u2019t always the best thing, but in our case, we needed warm bodies to help bolster our economy and a lot of people moved away and never came back because they found better opportunities elsewhere, or they moved and their kids were in better schools. The overall is that the city had for all intents and purposes really recovered within 7\u20138 years after the storm. By around 2012 we were fully running at speed, and regrowing. Even with a slack economy, we were still at least holding ground. The interesting thing is the pandemic. While it\u2019s affected the whole country, for a place that really relied on tourism, it\u2019s been a death blow, from which there may not be a strong recovery. With Katrina, other people could come here and help. With the coronavirus, everyone is locked down because everyone nationally is dealing with the same issue. Unemployment is as high as it\u2019s ever been. Were it for a few weeks or months, we\u2019d weather it. But this virus is doing things Katrina didn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t. Businesses are shutting down and may not be able to come back at any time. There was no point in Katrina where SO many businesses were just completely closed for so long. My place was closed for 1.5 months. By 6 months, we weren\u2019t business as usual, but we had plenty enough business to survive. This may be worse than Katrina. ",

            "answer_text": "I live outside of New Orleans but visited more than I can count. I live about 30 miles away from Baton Rouge, which is up the river. Agreeing with the natives answers, define recovering. There are areas that will never be the same, whereas others (pre-coronavirus) ended up doing better because of it. I like to hate on New Orleans people because of their unique characteristics, unnerving weirdness and determination. If it wasnt for that New Orleans would be a different place today. A lot was learned, a lot was upgraded, a lot will never return, a lot are saying they will only die there and nowhere else, and a lot of the good and some of the bad hasnt changed a bit. You can still go there (again pre-coronavirus) and do and experience exactly what you could have experienced before Katrina, in that sense it has recovered, in the same sense a soldier surviving a bomb. Part of him may be lost, but his soul and mind still continues to fight. ",
