            "answer_text": "Butchered would not be the correct word. The IE languages spoken in Central Asia and Siberia were gradually replaced by Turkic languages from the east. Historical and archaeological evidence indicates that Central Asia and Southern Siberia had been inhabited by Indo-European (specifically Indo-Iranian ) ethnic groups from c. 2000 BC to early centuries AD. This occupation was the result of the Sintashta- Andronovo expansion c. 2100 - 1500 BC out of the Pontic-Caspian steppes  Languages spoken across Eurasia in the first millennium BC However by the time the Scythians migrated west to Eastern Europe, substantial mixing with non IE populations seems to have taken place. During the period of the Great Migrations (300 - 500 AD), Turkic tribes from the Eastern steppes moved west, displacing the earlier Iranian inhabitants- Scythians and Sarmatians. This is the event that seems to have kick-started the Barbarian invasions of Europe and Southern Asia that destroyed the Western Roman Empire and ravaged many others. After this, the region of Inner Asia continued to be occupied by the Turkic tribes and they even gradually expanded westwards and southwards, founding the Ottoman Empire of Turkey and various Muslim kingdoms of the Middle East and India. The Iranian languages spoken in Central Asia (with the exception of Tajik still spoken in the Pamir highlands) were replaced by Turkic languages.  So the IE population of Central Asia was largely replaced by Turks though their genetic legacy still appears in the region. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, actually no. Central asias population consisted of two big people: indo europeans to the west and turkic people to the east (mostly kazakhstan, krygyzstan and mongolia were populated by turkic people and in some cases also by indo europeans), after the fall of the gokturk empire most turkic people migrated more to the western regions of central asia, some intermingled with the indo europeans. Some did not.Some tribe who went deep into europe like bolgars, khazars, sibir also vanished due to intermixing. However the indo europeans in central asia didint have a massive population to begin with. This is why they didint survive except for the tajiks and pashtuns. Years Before turkic people migrated to the western regions of central asia, many indo europeans migrated out of centrla asia, this is why their number were already small. Also not all places of central asia - which is a massive geographic area - was populated.Example:Modernday persia was populated by semitic elamites, the indo iranics tribe moved there, mixed with the elamites and kinda absorbed them. And dont forget the persians are one of the biggest people of indo iranics, same thing can be also said for medians and other indo iranics.This is why indo european population wasnt that huge because their biggest tribe left central asia centuries ago. The middle east was mostly semitic with some other people. Iranics, turkic people also came later. So turkic people really didint kill indo europeans, some of them intermigled with them, some migrated out of central asia, some became fixed in places that were not populated. However the mongol empire did indeed kill many indoeuropeans, the mongols mostly attacked big cities and indoeuropeans were often times settled people.Mongolians burned entire cities. And after the mongol empire was build, many mongol tribes came IN ADDITION to the turkic ones to central asia. For example hazara, some uzbek and kazakh clans are of mongolic origin. This is why turkic people and mongolic are dominant. ",
