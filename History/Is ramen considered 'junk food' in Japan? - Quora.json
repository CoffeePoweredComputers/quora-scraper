            "answer_text": "Ramen prepared at a restaurant is still considered (rightfully) unhealthy, though I can\u2019t comment further on other cultural attitudes towards it. Treating it like it\u2019s healthy because it\u2019s somehow \u2018high quality\u2019 (hint, it\u2019s made with the exact same ingredients people cook with at home) is foolish. Compared to the rather light, rice-based meals common in Japanese cuisine, ramen is filled with oil, salt, and the fattiest possible cuts of meat to add flavor. For a hungry young person, this is often welcome on occasion, but it\u2019s clearly quite unhealthy. Take a look at a standard bowl of tonkotsu ramen; there will invariably be several slices of marinated, fatty pork belly, half or a whole salted egg, some sliced mushrooms, a few sheets of salted laver, some thinly chopped chives and perhaps two or three leaves or pieces of bok choy or other greens. This is consistent with my experience at Japanese-catered ramen shops in Tokyo as well as every picture I find online. I couldn\u2019t find too many references to nutrition facts (as Japanese restaurants are not obligated to publish them), but a quick search finds an article here So How Bad Is Ramen For You, Anyway? saying that a standard bowl of ramen at an international Japanese chain in Toronto is about 1,250 calories (certainly consistent with my experience), has 70 grams of fat (daily intake recommended is between 45\u201375 g) and 2,860 mg of salt, which is double the recommended *daily* amount for an adult. Compare it to a Whopper meal at BK here: Burger King Nutrition Facts & Calorie Information: Carbs, Calories, etc, and for god\u2019s sake, a Triple Whopper with Cheese is\u2026 healthier for you. 1470 mg of salt (HALF that of a bowl of ramen), 1220 calories (same). A regular Whopper is a measly 980 mg of salt and 660 calories. Restaurant made ramen is incredibly unhealthy, on the same level as instant noodles. Next time somebody tries to tell you ramen is \u2018good for you\u2019 because it\u2019s \u2018high quality\u2019, ignore them. They\u2019re beyond your help. ",

            "answer_text": "Ramen (proper ramen not the instant ramen that Zoran referred to below) is not considered junk food but there isn\u2019t really the same concept of junk food as in western countries. Proper ramen broth takes hours to prepare, particularly the styles that are made using pork or beef bones. Ramen shops tend to have a faster turnover than izakayas or other restaurants so might be seen as \u2018fast\u2019 food but they are, usually, high quality so not \u2018junk\u2019 food. ",
