            "answer_text": "A2A by Ron Shabbaz! :-) Well, the first civilizations in the Middle East and Egypt were born near the rivers, Tigris, Euphrates and Nile.  Roman, Indian (Dravida) and Chinese civilizations were born near rivers too, Tiber, Yellow river, Yangtze and Indus\u2026    But some civilizations like the Greek one were born \u201cthanks\u201d to the sea\u2026  But, Illyrians? Illyrians didn't create one civilization, but many civilizations, especially in the south, were Illyrian people created cities and states based on the Greek model (because S. Illyrians lived close to Greece). The first attested Illyrian civilization was made by the Enchelii tribe in the 8th Century\u2026  The Kingdom of Enchelii was settled around Prespa and Ohrid lakes, after the kingdom fell and was divided. Encheli Kingdom was always in war with Northern Greeks, Herodotus recorded an attack made by the Encheli counter the temple of Delphi.  The representation of an Illyrian noble warrior in 500 B.C. After the Enchelii, other tribes created civilizations, Taulanti, Ardiaei, Luburnians and Dardani\u2026  Kingdoms of Illyria (ruled by Ardiaei tribe) and Dardania  Liburnian Kingdom  Empire of Illyria before Roman conquest Taulanti\u2019s kingdom fell because it was conquered by the Macedonians of Philip and Alexander, Liburnians created an \u201cEmpire\u201d in the Adriatic thanks to their piracy activities, they settled also in Corf\u00f9, Dardanians were governed by the dynasty of Bardyllis (Bardhyll, white star in Albanian), that governed both Dardania and Illyria after the Taulantii. But, the most powerful civilization in Illyria was the Ardiaei kingdom, Agron expanded it on Pannonia and inglobed the tribes in the north (including the Liburni), and the kingdom became an Empire, when queen Teuta took the power, almost all Illyrians were unified in a single country, there were also some non-Illyrian ethnic minorities (Celts, Phrygians, Greeks, etc\u2026).  Artistic representation of queen Teuta and Illyrian warrior during an attack, Illyrians practiced piracy and the cult of war Unfortunately Illyrian tribes continued to fought each other, even mountains were a problem, communication was not so good, especially in the north, were Illyrians were not so civilized as in the south. In the 2nd Century B.C. Illyrians lost their empire and their fragile unity, thanks to that, Romans could defeat Illyrians and conquer the territory (but they sweat a lot for that, Illyrians were able warriors, more than Romans, the problem was the fact that they weren't really united as the Romans), the northern Illyrian tribes became independent and returned to their tribal life, Luburnians recreate their Kingdom but it was conquered too, in the end of 1-2nd Century A.D. all Illyria was under Roman rule.  Maximum expqnsion of Roman Empire There was also a revolt, but it was suppressed and Illyrians were Romanized (with the exception of the South Illyrians that became the proto-Albanians, but Latin influenced our language). So, Illyrians created a civilization and it would be a great and powerful if it had not been for the Romans. :-(  Illyrian Helmet ",
