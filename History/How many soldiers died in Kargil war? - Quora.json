            "answer_text": "I don't know numbers that I can tell you how many soldiers had died. But if we talk about proportions then we lost large number of soldiers as compared to Pakistan's.Kargil war was not stopped there at 1999, it's still going on by the name of ceasefire. We are saving borders & still we are loosing our people. I think we have no numbers that we can tell how many soldiers had given sacrifices & are giving still now.The number will be always uncertain.
