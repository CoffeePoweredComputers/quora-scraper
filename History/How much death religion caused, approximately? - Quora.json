            "answer_text": "false religion is to be differentiated from pure and undefiled religion. for example Jesus said be harmless as doves. in the latter day saints religion, it is said to renounce war and not to kill, nor do anything like it. compared to Islam, all christians, jews and apostates must be killed. unless they vow to become muslim. but that would violate both faith and freedom and liberty even freedom of conscious where the bible teaches one version of Jesus and the according to the bible by comparison the Koran teaches an antichrist or satan as their savior. so where the islamic religion teachers murder, and lying, also rape and beating women, there cannot be justification of islam being the religion of God. so you have to count the deaths by each religion and then determine which religion doesnt kill in the name of God by following holiness rather than secret combinations.
