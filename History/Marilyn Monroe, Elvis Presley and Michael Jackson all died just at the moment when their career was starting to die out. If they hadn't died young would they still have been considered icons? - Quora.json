            "answer_text": "So here's where that's tricky. Their careers began to die for the same reason that they did. Monroe was difficult to work with toward the end. Her drug and alcohol dependency were really not assets on set, so fewer directors were interested in working with her. Those who were happened to be lesser directors with lesser scripts, so the movies being made were less good. Then, as she was in worse performances, her prestige dropped and she was then offered even lesser roles. Elvis followed the same trajectory. By his death, he'd been doing almost nothing but Vegas revues and his importance as a popular musician had faded. His last real hit was Suspicious Minds, which is frankly my favorite Elvis song, but it didn't have the traction of any of his previous works. Same sort of deal, though: an alcoholic drugged Elvis wasn't someone that top-tier producers wanted to work with, so the songs he got to record were inferior to those he had years prior. Michael Jackson hit the same wall. His life went a bit insane, he became difficult to work with (as well as a PR disaster), and so he stopped getting opportunities that would have helped him.  The thing is that they were already legends. They had been displaced in their fields by newer artists, but they were never unpopular. Sure, they stopped releasing new popular music and films, but they were already remembered fondly. Seven Year Itch was referenced countless times in other television and movies, specifically the skirt flipping up from the sidewalk vent, while Monroe was still alive. She was a pop culture reference, a meme even, prior to her death. Elvis Presley sold out his Vegas residency nearly every weekend until his death. Despite not releasing albums regularly, he was in the ten best-selling musicians in every one of the ten years prior to his death. Michael Jackson was a big enough star that I was born in the 1990s, missing effectively all of his career, and most everyone I knew was familiar with his hits well before he died.  Kenny Rogers died a few weeks ago. He hadn't released music in years. He's always going to be remembered, despite his career slowing, because he already has been remembered. They were all legends in their own right, and they will continue to be. ",
