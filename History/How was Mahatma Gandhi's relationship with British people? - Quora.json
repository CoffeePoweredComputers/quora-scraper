            "answer_text": "Since the question requires to primarily focus on the view point of commoners, I will concentrate on the specific instances and statements given by British personalities other than the viceroys and officers in India.  Vox populi, Gandhi was a leader of the masses and was exceptionally revered beyond borders for his humanitarian outlook and still continues to be.     Gandhi\u2019s admiration for the BritishGandhi  returned in 1914, equipped with a new method of action anda long-meditated programme for India\u2019s regeneration. Gandhi was in those days an enthusiastic supporter of the British Empire. It stood for ideals with which he had \u2018fallen in love\u2019, had given him unrestricted access to Britain and South Africa, and had exposed him to many new ways of life and thought.Not surprisingly he urged his countrymen in London and India to support the British war effort, and himself raised Indian Ambulance Corps in London in 1914 and recruited for the British army in India in 1918. Although a votary of non-violence, he insisted that his loyalty to the empire required him to give ithis full support in times of need.  The incident with the Judge- Non-cooperation MovementFor his leadership in the Non-cooperation Movement, Gandhi was arrested in March 1922 and tried.  He did not hire a lawyer and faced the prosecutor alone, symbolizing the helplessness of subject India before a well-organized colonial state. He did not  defend himself either, and used the occasion to explain why \u2018from a staunch loyalist and co-operator\u2019  he had \u2018become an uncompromising non-co-operator\u2019. The deeply moved British judge bowed to Gandhi and remarked that Gandhi was   in a different category from any person I\u2019ve ever tried or am likely to have to try He reluctantly sentenced him to six years\u2019 imprisonment, saying that, iffor some reason the government were to release him sooner, no none would be \u2018better pleased\u2019than he'. Gandhi responded by thanking the judge both for the most courteous manner in which he had treated him and for imposing a sentence that was \u2018as light as any judge\u2019 could have imposed under the circumstances. The trial, a remarkable episode in British colonial history, highlighted Gandhi\u2019s style of operation, and the respect Gandhi inspired among the British.  Rendezvous with the distinguished \u2013 Round table conference (1931)The 1930 Satyagraha led to negotiations in London, where Gandhi arrived inSeptember 1931. A popular and much sought-after figure, he met and impressed many leaders of opinion, Oxford academics, religious figures, and even George Bernard Shaw and Charlie Chaplin. He visited different parts of the country including Lancashire, where he apologized to the textile workers for the damage his boycott of British cloth had caused them and asked for their sympathetic understanding.  He made a \u2018never to be forgotten\u2019 visit to C. P. Scott of the Manchester Guardian, \u2018the most impartial and the most honest paper in Great Britain\u2019. He visited the King at Buckingham Palace dressed in his usual loincloth, which he had adopted in 1922 as a mark of his identification with the poor, throwing over his shoulders a shawl that he had worn in Britain to protect him against the cold. When a journalist commented on his sparse attire, he replied that \u2018the King had enough on for both of us\u2019.                              [ Gandhi with Charlie Chaplin ]  Evans and RogersIn the same year, during his visit to London, two body-guards : Sergeant Evans and Sergeant Rogers were assigned by Scotland Yard for his protection. The detectives shared Gandhi\u2019s hectic and painstaking schedule throughout the day. They would wake up at 4 AM and followed him on his morning walks in cold and foggy weather.This continued for several days.Once back in India, Gandhi initiated the boycott of all British goods. He however called his secretary and told him to get two English watches for the detectives. His secretary searched several shops in Mumbai and at last bought two watches.\u201c Why English watches? \u201c ---wondered his secretary. Gandhi replied,\u201d I promised them English watches. The delighted Evans and Rogers did receive those watches as presents from Gandhi.  SheridanSheridan, traveler and author of many travel books, who was privileged to be with Gandhi during his Round Table Conference days in England in 1931 to model his portrait, wrote about his availability to all who sought his advice,  \u201cEvery morning, from ten to twelve, he was available to all those who sought his advice or proffered appreciation. He received them with a fraternal kindliness and tolerance, but never let them interrupt his spinning\u201d    Gilbert MurrayGilbert Murray, Emeritus Professor, University of Oxford, testified about Gandhi: In a world where the rulers of nations are relying more and more upon brute force and the nations trusting their lives and hopes to systems which represent the very denial of law and brotherhood, Mr. Gandhi stands out as an isolated and most impressive figure. He is a ruler obeyed by millions, not because they fear him but because they love him. Gandhi believed in the \u201cGreat Oneness,\u201d according to which everything is part of God. \u201cI am a Hindu and a Muslim and a Christian and a Jew\u201d, he said.He was honored and adored by not just Hindus, but also by the British, both common men and imperialists. =============================================== Documentary: Infamous assasinations - Mahatma Gandhihttp://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/gandhi-parekh.pdfhttp://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/ijls/new/vol7iss2/IJLS_Vol7Iss2_Barnabas_pp132-150.pdf ",
