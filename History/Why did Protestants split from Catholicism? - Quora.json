            "answer_text": "In understanding the history of Protestant Church and the Reformation,  it is important to first understand that one of the claims that the  Roman Catholic Church makes is that of apostolic succession. This simply  means that they claim a unique authority over all other churches and  denominations because they claim the line of Roman Catholic Popes back  throughout the centuries, all the way to the Apostle Peter. In their  view, this gives the Roman Catholic Church a unique authority that  supersedes all other denominations or churches. According to the  Catholic Encyclopedia, this apostolic succession is only \u201cfound in the  Catholic Church\u201d and no \u201cseparate Churches have any valid claim to it.\u201d It is because of this apostolic succession that the Roman Catholic  Church claims a unique authority to interpret Scripture and to establish  doctrine, as well the claim of having a supreme leader in the Pope who  is infallible (without error) when speaking \u201cex cathedra\u201d\u2014that is, in  the exercise of his office as pastor and teacher of all Christians.  Therefore, according to the Roman Catholic view, the teaching or  traditions of the Roman Catholic Church as they come from the Pope are  equally as infallible and authoritative as the Scriptures themselves.  This is one of the major differences between Roman Catholics and  Protestants and was one of the foundational reasons for the Protestant  Reformation. Of course, the Roman Catholics are not the only ones who try to claim  unique authority through apostolic succession or by tracing the roots of  their church back to the original apostles. The Eastern Orthodox Church  also claims apostolic succession, although their claim is very similar  to the Roman Catholic view. The split between Eastern Orthodoxy and  Roman Catholicism did not occur until the \u201cGreat Schism\u201d in A.D. 1054.   There are also some Protestant denominations or groups that will try to  establish a \u201cTrail of Blood\u201d that can be traced back through the  centuries to the first century church and the apostles themselves. While  these Protestants do not hold to apostolic succession in order to  establish the authority of a \u201cPope\u201d as an infallible leader, they still  look to that connection to the early church in at least some small  degree to establish the authority of their doctrines and practices. The problem with any of these attempts to trace a line of succession  back to the apostles, whether it is Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, or  Protestant, is that they all are attempts to derive or support the  authority of what they believe and teach from the wrong source, that of  some real or perceived connection with the apostles, instead of deriving  it from the Word of God. It is important for Christians to realize that  direct apostolic succession is not necessary in order for a church or  denomination to have authority. God has given and preserved the supreme  authority for all matters of faith and practice in His Holy Word, the  Bible. Therefore, an individual church\u2019s or denomination\u2019s authority  today does not come through some tie to the first century church and the  apostles. Instead, it comes only and directly from the written Word of  God. A church or denomination\u2019s teachings are authoritative and binding  on Christians only if they represent the true meaning and clear teaching  of Scripture. This is important in order to understand the connection  between Protestantism and the Roman Catholic Church, and the reason that  the Protestant Reformation took place. In regards to the history of Christianity and the claims of apostolic  succession, as well as the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s claim of being the  one true Church with unique authority, it is important that to  understand a couple of key points. First, we must realize that even in  the days of the apostles and the first century church, false teachers  were a significant problem. We know this because warnings against  heresies and false teachers are found in all the later New Testament  writings. Jesus Himself warned that these false teachers would be like  \u201cwolves in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d (Matthew 7:15), and that there would be  both \u201ctares and wheat\u201d that would exist together until the day of  judgment when He separates the saved from the lost, the true \u201cborn  again\u201d believer from those that have not truly received Him (Matthew  13:24-30). This is important in understanding church history, because  from almost the very beginning false teachers and false teachings have  been invading the church and leading people astray. Despite this, there  have also been true \u201cborn again\u201d believers who held fast to the biblical  doctrine of salvation by grace alone through faith alone in Christ  alone, throughout all ages, even in the darkest period of the dark ages. The second thing to realize to correctly understand church history is  that the word catholic simply means \u201cuniversal.\u201d This is important  because in the early Christian writings of the first and second  centuries, when the term catholic is used, it is referring to the  \u201cuniversal church\u201d or \u201cbody of Christ\u201d that is made up of \u201cborn again\u201d  believers from every tribe, tongue and nation (Revelation 5:9; 7:9).  However, like many other words over time, the word catholic began to  take on new meaning, or came to be used in a new sense. Over time, the  concept of a \u201cuniversal\u201d or \u201ccatholic\u201d church began to evolve into the  concept that all churches formed together one church, not just  spiritually, but also visibly, extending throughout the world. This  misunderstanding of the nature of the visible church (which always has  contained both \u201cwheat and tares\u201d) and the invisible church (the body of  Christ which is only made up of born again believers) would lead to the  concept of a visible Holy Catholic Church, outside of which there is no  salvation. It is out of this misunderstanding of the nature of the  universal church that the Roman Catholic Church evolved. Prior to the Constantine\u2019s conversion to Christianity in A.D. 315,  Christians had been persecuted by the Roman government. With his  conversion, Christianity became an allowed religion of the Roman Empire  (and later became the official religion), and thus the \u201cvisible\u201d Church  became joined with the power of the Roman government. This marriage of  church and state led to the formation of the Roman Catholic Church, and  over time caused the Roman Catholic Church to refine its doctrine and  develop its structure in a way that best served the purpose of the Roman  government. During this time, opposing the Roman Catholic Church was  the same as opposing the Roman government and carried with it severe  penalties. If one disagreed with some doctrine of the Roman Catholic  Church, it was a serious charge that often resulted in excommunication  and sometimes even death. Yet throughout this time of history, there were true \u201cborn again\u201d  Christians who would rise up and oppose the secularization of the Roman  Catholic Church and the perversion of the faith that followed. Through  this church-and-state combination, the Roman Catholic Church effectively  silenced those who opposed any of its doctrines or practices, and truly  became almost a universal church throughout the Roman Empire. There  were always pockets of resistance to some of the unbiblical practices  and teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, yet they were relatively  small and isolated. Prior to the Protestant Reformation in the sixteenth  century, men such as John Wycliffe in England, John Huss in  Czechoslovakia, and John of Wessel in Germany had all given their lives  for their opposition to some of the unbiblical teachings of the Roman  Catholic Church. The opposition to the Roman Catholic Church and its false teaching came  to a head in the sixteenth century, when a Roman Catholic monk named  Martin Luther posted his 95 propositions (or theses) against the  teachings of the Roman Catholic Church on the Castle Church door at  Wittenberg, Germany. Luther\u2019s intention was to bring reform to the Roman  Catholic Church, and in doing so was challenging the authority of the  Pope. With the refusal of the Roman Catholic Church to heed Luther\u2019s  call to reformation and return to biblical doctrines and practices, the  Protestant Reformation began.  From this Reformation four major  divisions or traditions of Protestantism would emerge: Lutheran,  Reformed, Anabaptist, and Anglican. During this time God raised up godly  men in different countries in order to once again restore churches  throughout the world to their biblical roots and to biblical doctrines  and practices. Underlying the Protestant Reformation lay four basic doctrines in which  the reformers believed the Roman Catholic Church to be in error. These  four questions or doctrines are How is a person saved? Where does  religious authority lie? What is the church? And what is the essence of  Christian living? In answering these questions, Protestant Reformers  such as Martin Luther, Ulrich Zwingli, John Calvin, and John Knox  established what would be known as the \u201cFive Solas\u201d of the Reformation  (sola being the Latin word for \u201calone\u201d). These five points of doctrine  were at the heart of the Protestant Reformation, and it was for these  five essential Biblical doctrines that the Protestant Reformers would  take their stand against the Roman Catholic Church, resisting the  demands placed on them to recant, even to the point of death. These five  essential doctrines of the Protestant Reformation are as follows: 1-\u201cSola Scriptura,\u201d or Scripture Alone: This affirms the Biblical  doctrine that the Bible alone is the sole authority for all matters of  faith and practice. Scripture and Scripture alone is the standard by  which all teachings and doctrines of the church must be measured. As  Martin Luther so eloquently stated when asked to recant on his  teachings, \"Unless I am convinced by Scripture and plain reason - I do  not accept the authority of the popes and councils, for they have  contradicted each other - my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I  cannot and I will not recant anything for to go against conscience is  neither right nor safe. God help me. Amen.\" 2\u2014\u201cSola Gratia,\u201d Salvation by Grace Alone: This affirms the Biblical  doctrine that salvation is by God\u2019s grace alone and that we are rescued  from His wrath by His grace alone. God\u2019s grace in Christ is not merely  necessary, but is the sole efficient cause of salvation. This grace is  the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit that brings us to Christ by  releasing us from our bondage to sin and raising us from spiritual death  to spiritual life. 3\u2014\u201cSola Fide,\u201d Salvation by Faith Alone: This affirms the Biblical  doctrine that justification is by grace alone through faith alone  because of Christ alone. It is by faith in Christ that His righteousness  is imputed to us as the only possible satisfaction of God\u2019s perfect  justice. 4\u2014\u201cSolus Christus,\u201d In Christ Alone: This affirms the Biblical doctrine  that salvation is found in Christ alone and that His sinless life and  substitutionary atonement alone are sufficient for our justification and  reconciliation to God the Father. The gospel has not been preached if  Christ\u2019s substitutionary work is not declared, and if faith in Christ  and His work is not solicited. 5\u2014\u201cSoli Deo Gloria, For the Glory of God Alone: This affirms the  Biblical doctrine that salvation is of God and has been accomplished by  God for His glory alone. It affirms that as Christians we must glorify  Him always, and must live our entire lives before the face of God, under  the authority of God, and for His glory alone. These five important and fundamental doctrines are the reason for the  Protestant Reformation. They are at the heart of where the Roman  Catholic Church went wrong in its doctrine, and why the Protestant  Reformation was necessary to return churches throughout the world to  correct doctrine and biblical teaching. They are just as important today  in evaluating a church and its teachings as they were then. In many  ways, much of Protestant Christianity needs to be challenged to return  to these fundamental doctrines of the faith, much like the reformers  challenged the Roman Catholic Church to do in the sixteenth century.

            "answer_text": " It goes back to the Tudor period in England. Henry  VIII was the King at that time and he married Katherine of Aragon, his brother Arthur's widow; the Pope issued a dispensation. After 10 years of marriage, Henry did not had a son but had an legitimate daughter, Mary and an illegitimate son, Henry Fitzroy. I would personally say, Henry's soul was the most scrutinised in the Catholic realm, he even wrote a pamphlet with the hep of Thomas More in response to Luther. according to Henry, his marriage was not recognised in the eyes of god, so he asked Rome for an annulment, years went by and he even dismissed his Chancellor Cardinal Wolsey, a butchers boy. He finally got his annulment, when parliament made him the supreme head of the Church in England and he married Anne Boleyn. The first major split off from Rome and the Catholic church was the Eastern Orthodox church, from which all the various Orthodox groups came--Russian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, Syrian Orthodox, etc. The Eastern churches were really the first split-off from Rome. Later, of course, Protestantism split off from Romanism also. Martin Luther was the leader of the Reformation when Protestantism first split off from Catholicism, and the Lutherans were the first major Protestant denomination and the largest and most powerful, because they swept Germany and the Scandinavian countries, and that's why Luther's usually given credit for being the leader of the Reformation. But there were also many other reformers: Savonarola in Italy, John Knox in Scotland and Henry VIII in England and Calvin in France. Calvin was a Frenchman who had to take refuge in Switzerland, where John Knox visited, studied under and became a follower of Calvin and then returned to Scotland and led the Reformation there, organising the Presbyterian Church. So the modern-day Baptists and Presbyterians are usually considered descendants of the Calvinist Movement of those days, although there were Anabaptists before that. They followed Calvin and were called Calvinists, and their major doctrine was called Calvinism. Salvation by grace!Eternal Salvation!Once saved, always saved! That was Calvin's strong doctrine, along the line of Luther's also: Salvation purely by grace, not by works. Because at the time of the Reformation, the Catholic Church was strictly a religion of works and practices and church-going and ceremonies and all the rest. And that's still what they preach today, let's face it: You've really got to earn your Salvation by your works! And of course, nobody could ever make it that way! So they're building their Salvation on a poor foundation of their own self-righteousness, when only Jesus can save! In those days all of those reformers were considered Protestants because they Protested! They were protest-ants--Protestants. And of course they were risking their lives to do it, because the Catholic Church held sway and held power and controlled the System and the police and they very often didn't hesitate to slaughter them or throw them in prison or beat them or whatever! One big army and invasion that the Pope sent North slaughtered one million Protestants in Bavaria alone!And that's why Bavaria is almost solidly Catholic to this very day! So the protestants got their biggest push primarily from Martin Luther, and John Calvin was sort of the Luther of France, and virtually all of those first Protestants were \"grace\" people. They were sick of the Catholic Church, which was all works, so to really make the break they had to break completely with a real doctrine of grace!\"Once saved, always saved!\"  ",
