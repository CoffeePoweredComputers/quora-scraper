I heard from my professor that there are more books written on History than any other subject. However, if your end goal is to get a job after BA (Hons) in history? Then, I would say change your major. You will definitely get a job after BA (Hons) in history. However, there is too much competition as the opportunities are limited. I hope it helps. ",
