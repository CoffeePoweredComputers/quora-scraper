            "answer_text": "The Romans were not really obsessed with racial purity like 19th century Europeans. The impression one gets from reading Livy\u2019s History of Rome is that in Rome\u2019s earliest days, Roman aldermen were almost desperate to populate the place. Measures included the \u201cRape of the Sabines\u201d where Romans stole the women of a nearby town and the existence of Arx, a sanctuary between the temples of Jupiter and Juno on Capitoline Hill where any criminal on the run could elude his pursuers. I get the feeling that the ancient Greeks and Jews were a lot more fixated on unmixed parentage of their own ethnic groups than the Romans. Romans, at one level accepted any person from any ethnic group who acted Roman, although the strict definition of \u201cacting Roman\u201d was changed over time from the stern and austere Patricians of the Early Republic to the cosmopolitanism of the Late Republic and to the extreme cosmopolitanism of the 2nd Century to the daemon worship of the 3rd to the Christianity of the 4th and 5th. That said, there was still a very snobby upper class in the Patricians and Senatorial class who thought everybody outside their circle wasn\u2019t really Roman, but those folks were like the 1% or their day. In the city of Rome itself, the most densely populated district was the Subura, a polyglot and polyethnic neighborhood where freed slaves and foreigners met and rubbed elbows with the descendants of the oldest farming families from the Republic who were disenfranchised during the Republic and sent to the urban center looking for work. The Subura was almost like a microcosm of the Roman Empire itself where outside groups were brought in and Romanized. Even in the centuries when Rome was confined to the middle of the Apennine Peninsula, there were merchants and priests of Carthaginian, Jewish, Anatolian and Egyptian cultures present in the city of Rome herself. So, in conclusion, the \u201cRace\u201d of Ancient Rome was a very mixed or blended combination of pretty much all the ethnic groups represented in the confines of the borders of the Roman Empire as it changed over time. At the beginning, it was the people of Italy, later becoming more a combination of Mediterranean types, then more Germanic in character as more slaves then soldiers cam from the North. But again, Romans were not as interested in race as specific features as much as culture or the combination of culture and geography. ",

The Romans were part of the Latin group which was part of the Italic Group which was culturally closer to Hellenes. if you want more read my answer to a similar question. Antonio Arcano-Silva's answer to Are Greeks considered white? They were not White, White was the Germanics and Celtics. they describe themselves are being in between Middle eastern and Whites, the beginning they had dark curly wavy hair creme colored skin. they could have been even darker they fought the already established people there the Etruscans and they had copper-colored skin they were absorbed by the Romans. here a fairly realistic depiction of a Roman Fighting an Etruscan, armed in Greek style manner. Etruscan were believed to be a North African group.  Romans were Darker colored and Etruscan would kind of like a reddish colored tan. Remember racism is something new, it was created by colonialism due to the inferiority complex of White Europeans since they descended from Barbarians and there almost nothing knows of Pre-Celt Europe while the rest of the world had ancient civilizations. Back then racist by skin color was non-existent at least I never read anything ancient about racism by skin color. what they hated was an association, they disliked other tribes, nations, empires due to competition\u2026. but the later Roman Empire itself was multicultural. it\u2019s ironic that we see our past as savage yet they had more common sense than today.

Citizens in Roman Britain and in Germania had lighter complexions and were more likely to have red/blonde hair than citizens in North Africa. As for the city of Rome itself, it was a melting pot of the different ethnicities in the Empire. Most residents of the city were Mediterranean in appearance, but people with blond/red-hair and people with sub-Saharan African appearance were also relatively common in the city. Ostensibly, Italic and Celtic languages might belong to the same branch of Indo-European so the earliest \u201cRomans\u201d might have some \u201cCeltic\u201d traits such as red hair. But we must also remember that physical traits and language families don\u2019t correlate perfectly. When a new culture/language takes over, it is usually done via assimilation of and intermarriage with indigenous peoples rather than complete population replacement (the cases of European colonization of what is now the US and Canada were actually rare exceptions rather than the norm).
