            "answer_text": "It killed off half the population of Europe. What was before the plague cheap and plentiful labor became more expensive as laborers and even God forbid peasants could suddenly demand higher wages and even leave their lord\u2019s estates to work in the towns and cities. On a less positive note nobody knew exactly what caused the Black Death and many thought it was God\u2019s wrath on a sinful society. This brought many people to join groups like the Flagellants who demonstrated their penance by walking around the countryside whipping themselves. These groups were eventually suppressed by Church and State brutally as they were seen as a threat to stability. ",
