            "answer_text": "Comparing GGS (Guns Germs and Steel) to Shakespeare is ridiculous. Terms like \u201cwork of genius\u201d are entirely inappropriate. It does have some value, but Diamond goes way over the top to make his point, and unfortunately engages in some dishonest rhetoric to get there. GGS addresses a major question in world history and sociology: how and why did the West gain such a power advantage over the rest of the world? Many other historians have tackled this question; William McNeill wrote his classic The Rise of the West - Wikipedia in 1963, and it\u2019s still an excellent resource today. Western global dominance has been the cause of some major problems. The worst of them were imposed on the victims of Western colonialism and other nations which lacked the military and economic power to withstand Western imperialism. It\u2019s also caused problems in the West however; power corrupts, and Westerners have had to make a conscious effort to avoid that corruption. Within the field of history it has led to a reframing effort, converting the \u201cRise of the West\u201d into a more value-neutral form: Great Divergence - Wikipedia The \u201cGreat Divergence\u201d recognizes that prior to 1800 China and India had levels of economic and technological development comparable or superior to the West, and it was only after the Industrial Revolution that they were left behind. GGS was written with this same ideological goal. Diamond emphasizes that Westerners are not intrinsically superior to other people, and argues that it was only due to accidents of geography that the West gained global dominance. This message resonates with Westerners anxious to eschew racist aggrandizement and with non-Westerners alike; strange as it may sound, personal self-esteem is tightly coupled to feelings of tribal prestige. Just as there are risks associated with a false sense of racial or cultural superiority, inferiority complexes are also damaging. Jared Diamond undoubtedly has good intentions. Unfortunately GGS is more of a feel-good polemic than a true analysis of history and culture. For people who want a feel-good experience, GGS can be very enjoyable. For anyone wanting a more insightful understanding of history it\u2019s pretty useless. Calling it a \u201cwork of true genius\u201d is a joke. But it\u2019s still an enjoyable and good-hearted read.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll tell you fun fact. Seoul National University is doubtlessly, the number one university of South Korea. According to this announcement, \u2018Guns, Germs, and Steel\u2019 was most borrowed book in 2013, to students of the University borrowed from their library. https://en.snu.ac.kr/snunow/snu_media/coverage?md=v&bbsidx=119698 Do you know more shocking fact? That is, the status of \u2018the most borrowed book\u2019 of \u2018Guns, Germs and Steel\u2019 have been constant from 2010 to 2019. Of course, that fact doesn\u2019t directly support that the book is meaningful. But it might be one of supporting evidence. And as you know, South Korea is a small peninsula country at the end-tip of Eurasia and its position is the farthest place of traditional center of humankind. So, indigenous and localized culture was always basic trait of them. But they praise the book and the views in the book. And readers constantly recommend the book to freshmen. What does it mean? It tells, Idiosyncracies in that book is not in the level of gaining severe criticism. But of course, an impression and implications from a book varies. If one emphasized the fact, he can downplay the book. In my humble view, this book has made many people in the developed country, to be humble. It is the best point of this book in practical sense.
