            "answer_text": "Without official response from Quora developers, all we can do is guess. Personally, I believe that the devs regard their BOOKMARK function as a practical equivalent to browsing history, and therefore sincerely believe that \u201cnothing is broken/why fix it?\u201d I would like to call on loyal Quora users, thousands upon thousands of us, to respectfully TELL the developers: \u201cQuora IS broken! We love Quora, but its usability is crippled without browsing history! We love Quora, PLEASE FIX IT!\u201d Because Quora indeed IS broken. Browsing Quora is like reading a newspaper printed with disappearing ink\u2026 the previous article is GONE. Just blank newsprint now, where a moment ago there was something very interesting. Quora, why is it GONE? Why must it disappear? Browsing history has a totally different function than bookmarking: Browsing history requires zero user effort up front, meaning that it is always available. The usefulness of Bookmarking is only available AFTER you've bookmarked something, which means if you didn't bookmark it, as soon as you go onto the \u201cnext thing\u201d in Quora, IT IS ALREADY TOO LATE. Just about every other browsing platform has browsing HISTORY, so this peculiarity of Quora is jarring to Quora users and VERY frustrating to anyone just trying to find his way back to something he read a few minutes ago.Attempting to use the BOOKMARKING feature as a SUBSTITUTE for browsing history, means that you'd have to bookmark every browsing step. And then you'd have to go back and DELETE them (additional extra effort) otherwise your bookmarks will eventually overwhelm you. If you save EVERYTHING, you become a hoarder. You don't want to live in that house!Bookmarking is used for an entirely different purpose, a conscious and mindful notation of a particular topic. And this can be split into \u201ccurated\u201d and \u201cnot curated\u201d, which are SO DIFFERENT from each other that they amount to different functions, akin to the difference between a filing cabinet for business records, and Post-It notes on the fridge. CURATED links are the sorts of things that you build up over time, and BECAUSE they accumulate, you must \u201ccurate\u201d (organize into folders or categories) to keep them manageable. Curating keeps your silly cat video links separate from your important work saving the world from COVID-19, and separate from your Egyptology addiction, etc etc). Curated links are completely different from temporary links which aren't kept indefinitely. You don't keep the shopping list after you have bought everything on the list. If you come across something in your browsing that you want to share with your spouse this evening, bookmark it, share it this evening. And delete it later.Browsing history is neither of these things. It's footprints on the beach. It's looking in the rearview mirror and being able to SEE where you have been. It's roads and and bridges that continue to exist AFTER you've traveled them, allowing you to turn around. The real world HAS browsing history, because the rearview mirror SHOWS what's behind you, and the roads and towns you just visited don't vanish into a featureless, uninhabited prairie the moment you make a U-turn. Why does Quora\u2019s user-experience reality violate this feature of \u201creal\u201d reality? The brain EXPECTS the past to exist, at least as MEMORY.Browsing history works SYNERGISTICALLY with bookmarking: you might decide that you really SHOULD have bookmarked that thing you looked at ten minutes ago, or an hour ago, or yesterday\u2026 Stepping backwards through your browsing history allows you to go BACK and bookmark it, or at least review it. Sometimes it is subsequent/related Quora content that makes you really want to revisit that \u201cthing\u201d you were looking at 45 minutes ago. Sometimes it's your brother calling on the phone, and you tell him about something you saw on Quora. All you can do is describe it to him \u2026and as he listens to your boring/inadequate description of the fantastic thing, you lamely assure him \u201ctrust me, it was REALLY COOL\u201d. You certainly can't find your way back to it so you can't read it to him or send him a link. Why didn't you bookmark it 45 minutes ago? Because you didn't KNOW 45 minutes ago, that you'd have \u201cnot bookmarked regret\u201d 45 minutes in the future. The synergy BETWEEN bookmarking and browser history shows just how fundamentally DIFFERENT they are. A cartoonist sketches lightly in pencil to lay out the scene, and then inks over with India ink. They are similar in that they are both writing/drawing tools, but their differences allow them to be used SYNERGISTICALLY. Pencil+pen=synergy. Pencil+pencil=2 pencils\u2026 no synergy.And finally, browsing history helps the \u201cQuora experience\u201d survive when other things go wrong. I was watching one of those \u201creaction\u201d videos, such as the guy who previously only listens to rap music, hearing Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody for the first time, and being blown away by it. Or the Jazz snob or Classical music snob who thinks that rock is simple minded noise, finding out that Led Zeppelin did things with key changes, extremely sophisticated time signature switches and overlays (polyrhythms) that can only be described with advanced music theory terminology. And then the old jazz/classical guy pulls on his white beard and says \u201cOh. Wow. Led Zeppelin? Wow. Man, I've been blowing them off for 50 years\u201d. My question to Quora devs is, What do you do when you're halfway through the video, and the video freezes, and Quora takes a crap? You are halfway through, it stops, you try to unfreeze the video and the next thing you know, Quora blinks and you're in a completely different place. This isn't what you were watching 3 seconds ago! You've spent ten minutes watching the \u201csetup\u201d and now Quora hiccups and you will NEVER find your way back? Well, today I was watching a reaction video of a beautiful young black lady, she's a huge NBA fan, she knows the stars, she knows their stats, but she's just too young to know about Larry Bird. She\u2019s HEARD of Larry Bird. She's reading the Wikipedia article on Bird, she's commenting knowledgeably on what she's reading, she's nodding her head appreciatively, her eyes show that this Larry Bird guy is WAAAAYYYY more than she ever expected. And now, beautiful lady clicks on the link to the Larry Bird highlights reel, we see Larry pass the ball to his teammate BETWEEN the legs of the defender, we see her eyes widen at how how slick that move was, we see a three second blip of Bird's famous trash-talking\u2026 amused shock registers on her face at what a badass this skinny white guy is, and then \u2026 the video freezes. I try to unfreeze it, and everything's gone. I'm in a new universe now. I don't get to watch the rest of this video. I don't get to watch the BEST PART of this video. I've invested ten minutes leading up to this point. Maybe this frozen video isn't Quora's fault. Maybe it's my iPad. Maybe the service hosting the video steam is the problem. I don't blame the Quora app for things like THAT.BUT I DO blame the Quora app for making it impossible for me to see how it turned out. Browser history, PLEASE? Quora app IS broken. We love it, but it's BROKEN. I would like to call on Quora USERS to \u201chammer\u201d on this topic, until the devs realize that, well, maybe the \u201ccomplainers\u201d are actually RIGHT\u2026 maybe bookmarking ISN'T a substitute for browser history. They aren't \u201ccomplainers\u201d, they are FANS, trying to help us make Quora BETTER. So please, fellow Quorites. Bug them. Pester them. Beg them. Remind them. I don't know how stubborn or dug in the devs are, but we need them to change their minds. We may need hundreds of users to tell them. We may need THOUSANDS. Or it won't ever get fixed. If you agree, please upvote, or write your own \u2026 ",

(Quora urgently needs to implement it) However, a few days ago, I faced a similar situation wherein I wanted to refer the answer I read long back and forgot to bookmark. The only thing I remembered was Happiness Jar. I did the following (and so should you)- ~Step-1:  ~Step-2:  Now, it is all left up to you. Search a bit around and if you precisely recall a typical keyword, you\u2019ll have the results. *Bonus* If you wish to revisit those answers wherein you upvoted or left a comment, but didn\u2019t bookmark it, go to the My Activity section in your profile. You have everything that you need.  Thank you for the A2A Sibasish Mishra ",
