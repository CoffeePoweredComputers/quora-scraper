            "answer_text": "Because historians and chroniclers of global history, who have mostly been of Western origin, have agreed not to name any of the other conflicts that have involved more than simple regional squabbles anything but \u201cWorld War.\u201d As a comment on Thirafi Dide\u2019s answer and maps, I pointed out that making a similar map on all the interests and players in the First and Second Congo Wars, the Angolan war, and most importantly (I\u2019m just adding this part), the Middle East, prove that we have had many more conflicts that deserve to be titled \u201cWorld War\u201d but haven\u2019t been. The goal here has been to diminish their extent in the history of the world to lie to us that we have enjoyed a period of relative peace since the founding of the United Nations. But this is only true if you live in Europe or America themselves, and not in the many states across where they have, and continue to, wage war. To build on this, I\u2019d point out that Fidel Castro was not just a minor player in the Angolan war for independence. Or the Algerian one. Or the Guinean one. Or in Ethiopia. He sent planeloads of supplies and thousands of soldiers across the world to assist in these wars, and even the Congo Wars[1] . These rebellions, as they are normally titled, were not simple conflicts. They brought in global players pulling on different ends, and cost millions of lives. Combined, they make World War I and II look like child\u2019s play. Estimates from the Second Congo War had estimates of 5.4 million deaths, which was then revised down by half when it was no longer convenient[2]. The conflict was causing 45, 000 deaths a month, half of them small children[3]. Account for the fact that these figures are estimates and the Congo Wars have raged in jungles and frontiers no white researcher would dare venture into, and you can estimate these figures to be much higher. That\u2019s just one example, and I don\u2019t even want to show you how the Middle East has been the epicenter of World War 3 for decades. The question then is, what makes a war significant enough to be called a \u201cWorld War\u201d by historians like me? Is it the who, the when, the where, or the what is being squabbled and killed over?

            "answer_text": "The question to be answered first is: why has there been a world war at all, or, more exact: Why hasn't there been a world war in - let's say - the 18th century? A war with fights all around the globe needs a certain technology that hadn\u2019t been developed until the late 19th century: - long distance transportation systems (with a certain speed and size) - long distance communication systems (again: with a certain speed) - tons of weapons and ammo and a constant supply by a huge modern industry At 1900, all of that was there, and I guesss the leaders of the world felt like boys on Christmas Day: they couldn't wait to see it work! At that time there had only been few bigger wars you could call wars of the industial age: The US Civil war, the Crimean war and the war between Germany and France in 1870/71. Warfare was changing dramatically! But it wasn\u2019t until the Great War, that the image of war as a gentlemen's sport on horseback was abandoned. Soldiers were reduced to victims. They were bombed, shot, gassed, irrespective of the side on which they were fighting. The Great War traumatized many. Even Private Hitler, who was deeply convicted that a man's life was worth nothing. Men die, but their people lives on, so you better feel for nations and not individuals. WWII is often regarded as a sequel from WWI, with similar actors. But the technology had advanced and made it almost impossible to happen: By the end of WWII at least, the enemy\u2019s homeland was in reach of weapons, and the amount of destruction had become so huge, that the enemy\u2019s country as well as your own country could be damaged severely. Since then, wars are kind of limited. World Wars are very unlikely nowadays. ",
