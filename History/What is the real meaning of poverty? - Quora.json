            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve known exactly one person I perceived as regal, a man of such openness, honesty, self-assurance, good nature and good humor that his presence was infectiously positive. He had been raised not just in poverty but abject poverty, impoverishment at a neolithic level\u2014handmade, dirt-floor mud hut; no electricity or running water; all food from hunting, fishing or scratch-earth farming; no vehicles; no stores; no medicine. (Why does research say there is no difference in happiness between an African native and a billionaire but there is between one that earns 40k per year and one that earns 20k per year?) Material Poverty. That I refer to as material poverty. My mother and her six brothers and sisters were raised in it. My grandfather had a secure job as a postmaster when she was born for the princely salary then of $8000. He decided to invest it in his life-long dream of owning his own farm just before the stock crash of \u201929. They survived the long depression as sharecroppers in rural Mississippi. My mother did not own a store-bought toy or dress growing up. Starting as a young child, she worked long days six-days-a-week in the cotton fields. She and her siblings ended up educated and accomplished, pillars of their communities, fun, engaging, generous. (What are ways in which poor children can outperform rich privileged children?) I grew up with no fear of material poverty\u2014even considered it salubrious, a honer of wits, a builder of discipline, a developer of character and realistic expectations. But poverty comes in another form that chills me every time I see it. Poverty of the Spirit. I refer to it as poverty of the spirit, and, oddly, it can occur at levels of income that would have seemed opulent to my mother\u2019s family or to my regal friend. Let me hasten to add that I see it as a social dynamic rather than a character flaw, but I can\u2019t really say that I have a grasp of what\u2019s at work. For example, the boys were raised in Menlo Park, California, an affluent area. When we hit the local supermarkets for our shopping forays, they each had their assignments: \u201cYou go to the bread aisle, you go get the ground beef, you pick out a dessert. Converge back at the cart.\u201d But especially when we were at the local Safeway, we\u2019d see couples pushing a cart with the kids required to be right at their side, often holding onto the cart. The parents were clearly putting a premium on not calling any attention to themselves; the children were shushed if they spoke up, and their every request was curbed. These children were being taught right in front of my eyes to think of themselves as lesser, indeed, to be lesser. That is in stark contrast to the poor children I saw traveling the world as a young man. In Korea, in Panama, in the Dominican Republic\u2026 kids were much more poor, but exuberant, cocky, engaging. They didn\u2019t think of themselves as lesser. I understand that the cause behind poverty of the spirit is social stigma. I\u2019m just not certain what accumulation of looks, tones, comments and so on from others around them can so wound a person\u2019s pride. My mother and her siblings were made to feel they were coping with adverse circumstance, not that they were victims or lesser. Having been poor and humble, she would admonish me, \u201cGod made each and every one of us, and He doesn\u2019t play favorites.\u201d That was a foremost lesson in raising my own sons\u2014you are neither below or above anyone else. Because of her lesson, I developed an approach that I\u2019ve since learned to call \u201ctalking to the king,\u201d from the old saw, \u201cTalk to the king in any man, and the king will appear.\u201d I have, over the course of an up-and-down life, had occasion to befriend a number of down-and-outers. Invariably, they rapidly brighten to being treated as an equal. I understand that many people have endured affliction and travails too much to bear, but in general I fear that poverty of the spirit arises simply because we are not kind and respectful to each other. It\u2019s not poverty; it\u2019s man\u2019s inhumanity to man. ",

            "answer_text": "We have an international definition of poverty. That\u2019s the World Banks number for \u201cabsolute poverty\u201d. Less than $1.90 a day. That\u2019s at today\u2019s American prices. It really does mean walking into Walmart with just less than two bucks and buying all your food, clothing, shelter, health care and everything for one person for one day. Note that this includes the value of food that you grow yourself and so on. It is the value of what you get to consume, not what you buy. The reason we use this number? Because that\u2019s about the historical norm for human beings since the invention of agriculture. This is pretty much how near all human beings - kings and priests excepted - lived from the beginning of history. It only really began to change in any significant way with the arrival of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Yes, there were minor changes here and there, maybe average lifestyles climbed to $5 a day for some people in a good time then fell back again. But up to 1750 there was never any really major deviation from this absolute poverty standard. Which is why we use it of course. Also, some 9.5% or so of all humans still live at this level, down from perhaps 50% 5 decades ago. There are other definitions of poverty out there but they\u2019re all really about inequality. Some have more than others, that\u2019s true, but that\u2019s not poverty, that\u2019s inequality. The usual measure for relative poverty is less than 60% of median income in that society. That really is a measure of inequality, not poverty. ",
