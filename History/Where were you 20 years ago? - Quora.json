            "answer_text": "Jan. 1999, I was lying on the hot sands of Waikiki Beach. Performing my seasonal duties as Beach Master of Waikiki and living the dream. Living the dream indeed, for I was still unaware of my true iguana nature. Believing myself to be a human, albeit a strange one, I would build my beach displays, my sand signs, bring in the boats hourly, consume my free Mai Tai\u2019s as payment, police the beach for cigarette butts, weave coconut leaf headbands for the kids, and generally just \u2018spread the Aloha\u2019. If it was middle of Jan., on a Sun., I would have been broadcasting the NFL playoffs from my HQ. on the beach, \u2018Hawai\u2019ian style\u2019. Donning my radio and headphones, I would have built one sand sign for Atlanta, another for Minnesota, in the NFC title game. With each score I would scramble into position, wipe off the previous numeral, and carve the updated data. Keeping all passing Malahini well informed. As I recall, that game kept me busy, as the Falcons won in OT. 30- 27.The AFC title game required a second set of signs with the Denver Broncos besting the N.Y. Jets, 23- 10. Less work, but still tiring. But I digress. I would have been on the phone a great deal, relaying instructions to my subordinates on how to counsel the President during his embarrassing impeachment proceedings. Bill finally took my advice and payed off Paula Jones $850,000 to officially end the sexual harassment lawsuit. He had to pull $375,000 from he and Hillary\u2019s personal funds and cash in $475,000 from his insurance policy to do it but, hey, if he had listened to me sooner his affair with Monica Lewinski would never have been exposed through Paula\u2019s lawsuit and there would have been no investigation leading to his impeachment by the House and subsequent trial in the Senate. Tch. (Or was that another hallucination?) But I digress. Ah, the beginning of 1999 was a glorious time for me. I had a thriving landscape business with several employees. Three crew leads that could handle the work while I wintered in Waikiki and summered at Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Adams, Mt. Snoqualmie, and occasionally returned to do the paperwork and bid contracts. I was sharing this huge 2-story house on 5 acres with my brother-in-law and his family. I had a large circle of good friends with whom I shared many great adventures. I was a healthy 44, in the prime of life and life was good. Little did I know that before the year would be out, I would be practically non-functional as a result of a mental breakdown after my wife of 20 years ran off to Reno with my best friend. (Yeah, I know\u2026oldest story in the book.) That my business would be in shambles, I would contract COPD and I would be homeless as a result of a trumped up rape charge. A lot to deal with while living in my truck. After hitting rock bottom, recovery took several years. So, where I was 20 years ago today, I would have been perfectly happy to have remained there. In limbo. This Month in History: January. ",

Let\u2019s work backwards. 13\u201318 years ago( I don\u2019t want to reveal my age) , before I was born ,before I was inside my mother , I was inside my father as a sperm. For the creation of this sperm , carbs and proteins would have been used. So before I was a sperm , I was a bunch of proteins and carbs. How did these proteins and carbs come inside my dad\u2019s body? Either directly or indirectly from plants. How did these protein molecules( amino acids ) and carbs form in the plants? Plants obtain resources for formation of proteins and carbs from 3 sources. From the soil , plants take in several mineralsFor formation of proteins , Nitrate and Nitrite salts are required. These are absorbed from the soil itself but the nitrate salts enter the soil from the atmosphere due to nitrification.From rivers , the plant takes water.Thus 20 years ago , I was in the soil , in the atmosphere and in a river. ~Thug ",

I had been married just a little over a year and my wife and I were desperately (and ultimately unsuccessfully) trying to get pregnant. My employer was in the process of being acquired by General Electric. Inexplicably, I somehow ended up in the middle of contract negotiations. I was totally over my head, but plowed forward anyway. The deal was closed in July of that year. At the same time I was managing a handful of R&D contracts I\u2019d been awarded. Government agency work. Mainly DoE, U.S. Army, and SCAQMD. Also, I was thinking that after 17 years with the same company, it was time to find a new home. It took more than 18 months before I found a suitable position, but it was one of the best decisions of my life. ",

And I was doing well with the former in spite of how much time I spent with the latter. In fact, it was around that time that I got a perfect score in German for an entire trimester. I was very proud of that. I had little else to be proud of, truth be told. I was also struggling with my sexuality. I had been taught that sex was bad. And I was wrestling with the idea that I, too, was a sexual being. Did that mean I was bad? I did not want to be bad. I did not want to have sexual feelings. Religious and conservative, I very much sympathized with Frollo. That is where I was 20 years ago, both in location and in disposition. ",

            "answer_text": "20 years ago, i had just turned 15. And in January 1999, we were still in Malbazar, district Jalpaiguri, West Bengal. Actually just out of curiosity i found couple of pictures from Google Maps,  There you can see Gurudwara Road(we used to call it Gurudwara Lane). I searched via Caltex More, which was the only major area i remembered. I can recognize the Kali Mandir. And actually, I found a Picture of the Gurudwara, on Google Maps, by RK Thakur, so Thanks to him,  The Picture is from Dec 2018, so its New. Our Gurudwara had a name also, which I am reading for the first time, Gurudwara Navi Sikh Sangat Mal.(\u0a17\u0a41\u0a30\u0a26\u0a41\u0a06\u0a30\u0a3e \u0a28\u0a35\u0a40 \u0a38\u0a3f\u0a71\u0a16 \u0a38\u0a70\u0a17\u0a24 \u0a2e\u0a3e\u0a32) Infact, i am seeing the Gurudwara after 20 years. The adjacent blue door on the right side, used to be weighing scale business of my Uncle. This is Caesar School,  This is Father John on the Right,  There seems to be a big new Temple made there now, its the Hanuman Mandir,  The local scenery is like this,   As you can see, the area is very \u2018Green\u2019, that is because it rains like 9 months of the year. It was said that at the back yard of our house, 50\u201360 years ago was like a Jungle with many wild animals, even Tigers. Even today is mostly a forest area. And its called \u2018at the foothills of the Himalayas\u2019 , because you can actually see the mountains from your house or while just standing. This type of area we used to go for local picnics, like Maruti Nadi.  Finally, I found out that there is a Buddhist Temple also, How can i miss it :)  Its written, \u09a8\u09bf\u09ac\u09cd\u09ac\u09be\u09a8\u0982 \u09aa\u09b0\u09ae\u0982 \u09b8\u09c1\u0996\u0982 , Nibb\u0101na\u1e41 parama\u1e41 sukha\u1e41, in Bengali, meaning Nirvana is the absolute pleasure. Thinking about it, i would not have much problem going back and living there in that environment, there is a certain serenity and tranquility about the location. Life is generally slow paced and less hectic compared to big cities. I left Bengal in mid 1999 after 10th Board Exams and we as a family left Bengal in the year 2000, after my younger brother passed 10th Grade. So, that's where I was 20 years ago, actually I don't feel that time has gone by too fast, It feels like I have lived some kind of life. Also, many here or other social media may not be even born 20 years ago, so i dont feel that young anymore, and that is ok :) There is actually a Video made by the Mal Municipality about MalBazar, for anyone interested in how the North East or the Dooars region looks like,  ",
