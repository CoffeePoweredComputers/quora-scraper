            "answer_text": "Yes. I had it used on me seems like many times. So much i burned a hole in my brain. Anytime i would use my god side, they would wipe my memory. Last time only partially worked because i was a 13 year old kid, the doctor said no more, you\u2019re damaging his brain. The image shown was ww2 footage of the nazi Reich. Then i can\u2019t remember anything. It was Dr. Death who invented it. Find it yourself if you\u2019re more interested. That plague right now, that is my divine retribution. Wake the hell up and LEARN SOMETHING. It\u2019s called tough love. If i have to kill millions to get you all to move in a righteous direction, so be it. I\u2019ve already killed over a million that i know of. As for that cabal, those false kings. Men who think themselves gods\u2014not demi gods like me. No these are just men. I will send them all to the deepest abyss. The only way for them to escape is when i crush their soul in my hand. They deserve no mercy. As a man, i just want to move on. I just want what is rightfully mine\u2014i above anyone on this planet have earned it. As a god, i am seriously considering killing you all. Gods, Demons, Humans. All ERASED. That is how furious, how purely wrathful my god half is. Because that me, was ignored above all else through these memory wipes. The more you ignore your shadow self, the darker it is. Many START ignoring theirs mid teen years, until about 25. So 10 years. I\u2019ve had mine ignored for over 20 years. That. That is psychology and the spiritual. TRUTH in ONE. SO YES, MEMORY WIPE ARE REAL. ",

            "answer_text": "No, but give me 15 minutes and I could probably invent them. Just need a rag and some toilet water. I'd put the two together and call it Mind wipes. My slogan would be you'd have to be out of your mind to use these or something. I don't think I'd have to worry about getting a patent. I don't know, it's still in the conceptualisation phase.
