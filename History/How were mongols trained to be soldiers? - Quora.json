            "answer_text": "i have read the various accounts alleging how the Mongol Army was trained but wonder what is the source of this information? was a vault of Mongol Horde training manuals or films recently uncovered? has the Mongol equivalent of Sandhurst or West Point been unearthed? one might ask given the glowing accounts of the Mongol\u2019s training, discipline and other virtues why the Army degraded so quickly? 57 years after Genghis Khan\u2019s death the Mongol force attacking Hungary in 1285 was annihilated. a year later the Mongols were routed in Poland. the Mongols Never posed a serious threat to those countries or Europe again. what happened to the vaunted Mongol war machine? as time went on the Mongol Army was regularly defeated but what had changed? did they forget how to fight or finally just come up against competent military opponents? could it be the prowess of the Mongols is just a myth? certainly once the Mongols were crushed they never ever became a military threat to any civilized nations but life on the steppe had hardly changed since Genghis Khan's time. the thing that had changed is civilized societies were no longer easy targets for a bunch of horse riding thugs. the Industrial Revolution sealed the nomads fate. Railways and repeating rifles allowed sedentary peoples to penetrate even the most wild and remote areas and conquer even the most determined and fierce of nomadic warriors. in the end the Mongols like other nomads couldn\u2019t even defend themselves.
