Estimates tend to run around 10,000 workers: Estimates given by various archaeologists for the size of the workforce at Giza tend to hover around 10,000 people for all three pyramids. These people were well-fed; in a study published in 2013, Richard Redding, the chief research officer at AERA, and colleagues found that enough cattle, sheep and goats were slaughtered every day to produce 4,000 pounds of meat, on average, to feed the pyramid builders. The finding was detailed in the book \"Proceedings of the 10th Meeting of the ICAZ Working Group 'Archaeozoology of Southwest Asia and Adjacent Areas'\" (Peeters Publishing, 2013). Redding used the animal bone remains found at Giza, and the nutritional requirements for a person doing hard labor, to make the discovery. How Were the Egyptian Pyramids Built? Solved!

            "answer_text": "The general academic consensus at the moment is: Stone was quarried elsewhere, and was taken to the pyramid side by boat, using the Nile and canals. There were skilled workers year-round, but during the annual inundation, idle farmers would serve as extra manual labor. They may have earned food, or simply viewed the work as a civic obligation. The limestone building stones would be dragged into place using ropes, and perhaps wooden sledges to ease movement. A system of ramps would have been put in place as the pyramid rose in height to get stones to the appropriate level. Opinions differ as to how many and how they would have been arranged. Casing stones would have been applied at the end, then polished. Thousands probably worked on the heavy manual labor\u2014dragging stones into place. There are no instructions left to us on how they were built\u2014we\u2019re inferring from some illustrations from the New Kingdom showing large statues being dragged by hundreds of men with ropes. We know there were skilled on-site workers from workers villages which have been uncovered by archeologists. ",
