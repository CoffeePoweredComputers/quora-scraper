            "answer_text": "In a socialist planned economy, production does not actually have to be on a monetary budget but can be seen as a question of allocating production resources and raw materials. In practice, using money to calculate this is far easier than to deal directly with resources and materials. But to grossly simplify, Moscow was paying Moscow to manufacture tanks. Given infinite resources and materials, it should have been simply a matter of ordering the number of tanks needed. ",

There were some tanks and other weapons supplied to Russia on a lend/lease basis but they paled in comparison to the internal production the Soviets made with the T34. Over 85,000 tanks ",
