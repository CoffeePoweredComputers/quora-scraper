            "answer_text": "I am going to be rather blunt here - the information given on this thread ranges from general | vague | theoretical to false to outright dangerous financial suicide. Yes, there is some links and references that will definitely help but I have yet to see an answer that explains step-by-step on how to do this. After all, who would you rather want to listen to - someone who Googled their info, someone who is marketing their printing services or someone who has his own online shop and social presence? Before I get to the technical info, let me first dispel some incorrect and/or misleading information and then I will get to a brief theoretical introduction. The bulk of this post, however, will be technical information to show you exactly what you need to do to set a business like this up. Disclaimer 1: There is no way that I can fit all the information necessary in this answer. It is enough to fill an entire book. Perhaps I should do a video on it though? Let me know in the comments if there is a need for this. I am definitely not going to spend hours and hours on producing a video tutorial if people don\u2019t indicate beforehand that they would like to see something like that. Disclaimer 2: I will be using my own business as an example. So there will be links and screenshots to my own stuff. Do I hope that this article will drive some traffic? Of course I do. But I believe that the value I will be providing will be so awesome that this is not seen as spam, as per Quora\u2019s spam policy. Dispelling the Myths Myth 1: Setting up an online tshirt shop is quick and easy. Excuse me while I try to recover from laughing. To put this in perspective, I am a web developer and graphic designer. And I can tell you that to set up a PROPER online presence is neither easy nor quick. You are either lucky or really, REALLY good of you start seeing sales within the first two months. I would wager that most online businesses of this nature never see any income. Myth 2: You need to borrow money from friends and family and buy stock and printing equipment. Yes, do this if you are completely off your rocker and you want to make life-long enemies of your friends and family. You need to start off by spending as little as possible. Remember, the odds are against you and you likely to fail for quite some time before you hopefully get it right. You can\u2019t afford to have debt during the start-up stage! These are your costs: Computer with broadband Internet access. This is kinda non-negotiable. Yes you can get away with a cheapie laptop but definitely upgrade your PC as soon as you can afford it. This is the tool that you are going to be using for up to 30 hours per day especially during the startup phase so you can\u2019t afford to be frustrated and hindered in your production. At least if the business fails you will still be able to use the PC, it won\u2019t be a very expensive doorstop like useless printing equipment. This is my hardware setup: Core i5 processor - really the bare minimum in processing power as graphic design and especially video production takes up lots and lots of processing juice.GTX 660 graphics card (a bit old in the tooth but gets the job done)16GB RAM - As with the processor, you really need plenty of RAM for high-quality design work.10TB Hard drive storage - you can get away with less but I am admittedly a bit of a hoarder.CMStorm mechanical keyboard - go as clicky as you can get. You can thank me later. You will be spending lots and lots of time typing,Razor Naga mouse - this one was a bit of a disappointment. Get a mouse that is ergonomically superior. Carpal tunnel syndrome is real and is a bitch.49\u2033 + 27\u2033 dual monitors - You need screen real estate and plenty of it for proper design work. The cool thing is that 4k TV\u2019s has now become much cheaper and can be effectively used as PC monitors. Dual monitor setup is HIGHLY recommended.Marantz 4140 hifi with Dyna speakers \u2014 ok you are not likely to be fortunate enough to get your paws on a system like this but good sound is a must. You will want to do audio stuff like video and you need to be able to hear properly. And it helps to keep you putting in 28 hour days if you listen to good music. I recommend EBM like Funker Vogt to keep you going. Get a good headset at the very least.Sound recording setup - I have a variety of mics, mixers etc. Getting your voice to sound right in recordings is VERY difficult.Canon DSLR & Gitup Git2 actioncam - Your cellphone camera is probably not going to cut it for video productions. the Gitup is pretty cool quality at half the price of the comparable GoPro model.Software: Start off by using Gimp for image editing, it is free. It can be downloaded here: GIMP You can also download Adobe CS2 for free here: Get a Free Photoshop Download Legally from Adobe (Not a Torrent) | PCsteps.com Later on you will want to purchase a more recent version of Adobe\u2019s products. You will primarily use Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Audition. You will need to watch YouTube tutorials on how to use these applications, I am not going to teach you that in this answer. Nuance Dragon dictation software is a nice-to-have that you might want to check out. You can probably churn out words faster with your mouth than with your fingers. And you are going to be churning out lots and lots of words. Website hosting My hosting is around $15 per year at Host4Africa.com GET MORE FOR LESS!, main page, low cost Web Hosting for South Africa and the world. but they do have some stuff that you need to be able to work around e.g. if you are developing your website locally on DesktopServer and then you try to migrate to the live host you will run into server timeouts. You need to contact them with specific instructions on how to temporarily adjust their server-side settings in order for this to work. If you need details on these instructions you can send me a query at https://krossbait.com/contact/ and I will send you the instructions. I don\u2019t think it is a good idea to post it publicly here. BTW - I highly recommend this approach where you first develop locally and then migrate. You could be stuck for months on development and then you are paying for hosting that you don\u2019t need. I lost 10 months on my one site due to getting busy with other projects. What a waste! Get Desktopserver here : DesktopServer - Create locally installed WordPress Websites \u2022 ServerPress, LLC. and install it on your PC, it is free. Use this plugin to migrate the website to the live server: All-in-One WP Migration So now it is settled, you need three things to start - PC, Internet access, Web hosting. Myth 3: Once your store is set up the money start rolling in The truth is that the Interwebs doesn\u2019t even know that you exist. You won\u2019t be found in the search engines. Nobody will find you online, even if they searched for your store name. Myth 4: Shopify is your best option (as recommended by many answers on this thread) I don\u2019t have anything per se against Shopify. For all I know it is a wonderful platform. But it has a monthly subscription fee. That means it is not a viable option in my opinion. If Shopify\u2019s business model was similar to MailChip\u2019s model where they only start charging you when your business has reached a certain level my opinion would have been different. Fixed expense with a uncertain income? No way baby. I bumped my head hard enough previously with Aweber. Myth 5: Step 1 - Research your market / know your market / find the right opportunity Nonsense. I might know that the robotics market is a vastly untapped market that screams for more engineers. Can I action any ideas there? Highly unlikely if not impossible. The first step is to make a shortlist of things that YOU are interested in. You are going to be spending an awful lot of time and energy on this business, it better be about something that you are passionate about and that you have lots of affinity for. If the topic isn\u2019t your passionate heartbeat there is no way that you are going to stick with it. Only after you have identified your topic, do you seek to match it with market opportunities. How do you do that? Let\u2019s move on to the next section so that I can explain the technical stuff: The Technical Stuff Finding a Market Opportunity Let\u2019s have a looksie at the process that I went through in order to identify my main business topic: Orgasm Art Memes Genre: BDSM I wondered to myself what I really like. I have worked in a number of industries before and most of them bored the living hell out of me. I have an exceptional imagination (I know because I had myself professionally tested), I have a dark sense of humour and I like sex (Duh). So my thoughts started wandering towards our deep and dark sexual desires and I thought of ways to make fun of it. Very subtle fun - sensual before funny. I have some experience in the life-style which I think is crucial. If you embark on something with theoretical knowledge only you will soon be seen as a fake or a wannabee. I then quickly evaluated the idea in my head: Will I have a target market? Yes, almost all people are interested in sex Can I find a viable niche market? Sure, BDSM is a recognized niche. 50 Shades proved that the niche is large enough to be viable. So far so good, now it was time to look at real numbers. Google Adwords Keyword research is a field of study in its own so I am really just going to show you a few basics. Short tail A vague keyword/phrase with lots of traffic and also lots of competition. Long tail A detailed keyword/phrase with low traffic and hopefully also low competition. Why is this important? Let\u2019s have a looksie at Google Adwords. You will need to register a free account here: Google PPC Online Advertising  We will be using the keyword tool that is accessible on the top righthand-side of the screen. First, we will get keyword ideas and then we will match them against specific key phrase search volumes and competition. Here we have used the keyword \u201cBDSM\u201d and sorted according to competition. We are only interested in phrases with low competition. We are looking for two categories of volume 1k - 10k and 10k - 100k. More than 100k and you are trying to compete in the field where all the big boys are and you are not likely to appear in search results. 1k - 10k is less competitive and you are more likely to be able to compete here. Less than 1k and the volume is not high enough to make it worth your while. Make a spreadsheet listing all the key phrases that matches these criteria AND that are related to the central topic that you are starting to formulate in your head. In my case I wanted it to be a sexy and funny spanking themed idea producing art, clothing and stories. I was definitely not going to hire actors and start making BDSM films. Also, I know very little of the Japanese BDSM culture so for these reasons phrases like \u201cbondage video\u201d and \u201cjapanese bondage\u201d did not make my list, even though they fit the volume and competition parameters. Then an idea struck - memes is a very popular method of making fun of things and lends itself very well to the medium of printed tshirts. Checking actual search volumes for specific phrases to following helped guide me to come up with \u201corgasm art memes\u201d as my site\u2019s central theme.  \u201cArt\u201d, \u201cmemes\u201d & \u201corgasm\u201d are all short tail. The competition might be low but good luck trying to compete using those three by themselves. \u201cOrgasm art\u201d, \u201corgasm meme\u201d & \u201corgasm art meme\u201d are all long tail with the latter being the most specific. Now we can also see something interesting here - why did I used \u201corgasm meme\u201d as a keyword. Well the easy answer is that at the time when I did this research it fit my criteria. Google Trends is a useful tool to see how keyword popularity goes up and down over time: Google Trends But in any case, I will rank if someone searches for \u201corgasm art\u201d or for \u201corgasm meme\u201d. Of course I will be very competitive if someone searches for \u201corgasm art meme\u201d but very few people search for that specific term. Now, as I did this check now for the article, my website has magically disappeared from the search rankings so I am rather alarmed. But fortunately I have a backup plan - my web presence extends beyond my website only. I wanted to discuss it later but this might as well be a good place to just show you the value of being present on as many places as possible:  And on Quora  Quick investigation So my website has all but disappeared from Google. Yesterday I still ranked quite prominently. The Google Search Console might provide a clue, seems like the host server is giving errors when Google tries to crawl it. I will have to investigate further once I have completed this article.  I know I jumped a bit ahead but I feel that its good that you get to have a look over my shoulder in realtime as I do these things. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll come back to the Search Console. Topic Research Conclusion We now have the three necessary elements in place: Something that I know fairly well and that I am passionate about. Something that I will want to keep researching and that I am willing to spend most of my waking hours with.A general idea that the topic and its specific niche is viable.A specific, refined keyword analysis that proves that there are enough search volumes and the competition is low enough for me to be able to compete.Hosting and Domain Name Your domain name is crucial. I slipped up here because I decided on https://krossbait.com before I did proper keyword research. I can kinda kick myself but I compensate by branding \u201ckrossbait.com\u201d as prominently as possible. But it would have been better if my keywords appeared in my URL. The https:// part is very important. You want to buy a SSL certificate right off the bat. It certifies your website as secure and accomplishes two things: Helps search rankings.Makes customers trust you more and therefore more likely to buy.Use a domain checker such as the one at Domain Registration to check for name availability. Some of the decisions you will have to make are: Length of nameKeyword inclusionLikelihood of typing errorsExtension e.g. .com or .org. If you want whoisguard (keeping your details private) .com is the way to go.Similar names of the competitionContent Management Platform I use Wordpress and therefore I will only use it in my discussion. You will need to install Wordpress on your hosting, typically using something like Softalicious. ***Important*** Your hosting plan needs to include at least one database or Wordpress will not be able to run. Website Building This is really not as simple as people make it out to be. Fortunately there are quite a number of good tutorials on YouTube on Wordpress development. I am not going to explain it here, I am just going to show you a couple of important points. I use the Storefront theme as its Woocommerce\u2019s native theme. Plugins I use Add From Server - to bypass the 4mb upload limit of media files. I FTP large files directly and then use the plugin to associate them in the media library.Advanced Woo Search - A cool search bar that is much more user-friendly than the default search bar.Akismet Anti-Spam - Keeps the leeches from spamming your website.Contact Form 7 - This is how your audience communicates with you.Custom Twitter Feeds - I am very active on Twitter. This displays my twitter feed on my site in the footer. Always good to link platforms.Dashboard Directory Size - Helps me keep an eye on how much disk space I am using on the server.Easy FancyBox - Necessary for lightbox, a nice way to display images.Flamingo - Stores all contact form queries in the database. Absolutely critical!Google Analytics for WordPress by MonsterInsights - Helps me to analyse web stats.MailChimp for WordPress - Used for email marketing.Max Mega Menu - A real nice menuMax Mega Menu - StoreFront Integration - makes Max Mega Menu work with the Storefront theme.MetaSlider - Method to display images.Orbisius Child Theme Creator - Always create a child theme.

This plugin automates the process.Redux Framework - Necessary for lightbox support.Sassy Social Share - Critical, gives me as well as visitors a way to share my products and posts on various social media platforms.Social Count Plus - Social credibility, tells people how many followers I have.Storefront Footer Text - Gives you the ability to edit the default footer text of the theme.Storefront Top Bar - Gives me two additional widget areas at the top of the screen, I use one for my search bar.Woo Product Slider and Carousel with category - Way to display products.WooCommerce - The heart of the website, the ecommerce platform.WooCommerce PayPal Express Checkout Gateway - Gateway that enables me to receive moolah from people when they buy my stuff.WooCommerce shop to Facebook - My shop is on Facebook as well. Cross-linking platforms, remember?WP Add Custom CSS - I can enter CSS code here to alter the appearance of website elements e.g. hide the default search bar.WP Super Cache - Makes my site fasterWP User Avatars - Put my pic next to my posts. Good for branding purposes.WP-DBManager - Optimize and backup the database. If things go wrong with the database you are in a world of hurt.WP-Optimize - Makes my site run efficiently.Yoast SEO - Highly critical, help me to let my site be discovered by the search engines.Select YouTube - Way for me to embed YouTube videos in my site.Absolute Privacy (not active) - Locks my website down when I am busy developing .All in one wp migration (not active) \u2014 Migrates my website from Desktopserver to the live environment. Also used to make backups.wp all import (not active) - make bulk changes to product data by importing and exportingwp all export (not active) - make bulk changes to product data by importing and exportingSite Identity Your branding needs to be consistent yet everything must not just be an exact copy of a copy. Your keyword list is of crucial importance here.  Building SEO Pages Yoast is your friend here. You really really need to have it installed. First things first, we are going to build the home page. Don\u2019t just call it \u201cHome\u201d, rather use this opportunity to stuff you main keyphrase in there like so:  Now add your content. Be sure to add some attractive and relevant pics that are not copyright protected. And easy way of finding images is with Google Images and selecting \u201cLabelled for reuse\u201d And seeing that you will be creating your own designs you should have images to put on your pages.  You will need to refer back to you keyword spreadsheet and make sure that you use your keywords but in normal, natural language. In the old days people just stuffed keywords but Google has gotten clever and will penalize you for that. Use the Yoast control panel at the bottom of the screen to make your SEO as good as possible. You goal is to convert red and orange lights to green lights.  You SEO status is also displayed on the right hand of the screen;  So you build page for page and then you set up product categories. For each of these you follow the same meticulous process. (Are you convinced yet that people are talking nonsense when they say that it is quick and easy to build a website?) Your final outcome of all this is that you want to build a menu that reflects the hierarchy of pages and categories like this:  You will need to activate Product Categories in the Screen Options to be able to add them to the menu.  I know it has been quite an information overload so far but the good news is that there is still plenty to come. If you have gotten stuck up to this point, you are welcome to drop me a line at https://krossbait.com/contact/ Product Creation I have products that exist on five platforms. All of the platforms have their own tools with its own positives and negatives. I like the detail and control that is built into the Prinful mockup interface. Redbubble is good for putting the same design on multiple types of products all at once. Printful: The primary source of products that appears on my website. Interestprint: I only use them because Printful doesn\u2019t do underwear. For my specific market this is very important. People are more likely to wear something naughty if only they and their intimate partners know about it. This:  is an easier sale than this:  Redbubble: A separate set of products exist here: krossbait: Top Selling T-Shirts, Posters, Greeting Cards, Stickers, Wall Art and More. The benefit, as shown earlier is that this goes on no matter what happens to my website. Plus, Redbubble is much bigger and receives more traffic than I do. Rather than to compete, I joined forces. A link to the Redbubble store is in the sidebar that appears on every page. Crosslinking, remember?  DeviantArt: Prints of the original artwork can be bought here: krossbait on DeviantArt Not only is it a potential source of income, but like everything, it is crosslinked and I am hoping that DeviantArt visitors might visit my site as well.   Here you can see that another user has added my works to his watchlist. that is the beauty of joining forces and working collaboratively. The idea is to pass on as much love as possible and then people will do the same for you. Internet marketing is like jail \u2026 you can\u2019t make it on your own.  Amazon: I make use of Kindle Direct Printing and it is linked to my website:  Remember that all products must be tagged properly. Your keyword research comes into play here an it might be more efficient for you to export your products to Excel, do the tagging and the import back to Wordpress. Be careful with the WP All Import process, don\u2019t wipe out all of the products that you have so painstakingly created. Submitting Sitemaps Up to this point Google and Bing has virtually no idea that you even exist. You need to kindly inform them that they need to tell people about you. You accomplish this by submitting sitemaps. Step 1 is to create the sitemaps in Yoast. Open the configuration wizard and follow the prompts:  The next part is quite tricky - to find the damn sitemaps. Click on the \u201cFeatures\u201d tab in Yoast and then on the question mark next to \u201cXML Sitemaps\u201d. Then the \u201cSee the Sitemaps\u201d link.  A new tab should open with the sitemaps. You want to copy and paste them one by one in the sitemaps dialogue box in the Google Search Console: Search Console - Home. You will have to sign up and create a property. This can be really confusing. Remember you can drop me a line on the link further up in this article if you need help. Just copy and past the part directly after .com/ as illustrated below.   Wait a couple of days until the sitemaps are indexed. Follow the same process for Bing: Bing - Webmaster Tools Backlinks Backlinks are one of the ways in which Google determines how relevant your site is. If a high authority site links to yours then you get some delicious link juice. But how the hell are you supposed to get that right? Asking bloggers whether you can be a guest blogger and make sure that your blogpost contains backlinks. Ugh \u2026 personally I am way too shy to ever consider doing this.100% Free SEO Tools - SmallSEOTools.com - use the backlink maker. The have some other nifty tools on their site as well and it is free.Backlinks in social media - when you create a Pinterest profile, for example, you get the opportunity to put your website link in your bio. Unfortunately many social media platforms mark links as \u201cnofollow\u201d which means that it won\u2019t really count as backlinks.Social Media Marketing And you thought that it was hard up to here. Fear not, now the real work starts. You can\u2019t just be on one place. You need to be as everywhere as possible. You need to get the maximum followers everywhere and accomplish that without triggering ant-spam policies that could get you suspended or banned. You also need to understand the difference in post persistence between the different platforms. I will discuss the posting strategy to the different platforms after all the platforms have been introduced. What is important to keep in mind regarding followers and likes is that it not only determines your potential audience but it also demonstrates credibility. So we might run campaigns simply to collect Facebook likes or we might jump on a SDV train in Twitter to collect followers but none of those will be potential customers for us. Those are just social credibility numbers and should be seen as only that. The last thing before we get to the individual platforms is stats and measurability. All the platforms have some way of analyzing who sees your posts, tweets etc. Use the analytics to get a better understanding of your potential. I can guarantee that some of your most brilliant posts will receive little attention while the post that you wrote half asleep suddenly goes viral. Social media is a temperamental beast. Facebook I will admit, I have no love for Facebook. I am there just because I have to be. It is the only platform where I get random video calls throughout the day and night from virtual strangers. It creeps the hell out of me. And Facebook probably has the harshest anti-spam triggers. Screw with that and they will lock you out of your account for days. Don\u2019t try to send too many friend requests at a time. Don\u2019t try to post too many posts in direct succession. You will need an account with a business page. Fill in all the relevant details. You will need to come back to this page to update it with links to your other social accounts - everything needs to crosslink, remember? Note how my branding is aligned to my website as well as to my other platforms and how my other platforms are linked - Albie Kross  On the business page you will need to have a store. In order to do this you need to open a Please Login again - StoreYa.com account and the WooCommerce shop to Facebook plugin installed on your website. Follow the instructions and port your Woocommerce products to the Facebook store. Can be a bit tricky, make sure you read the StoreYa instructions carefully. To get Facebook friends you can basically do things to start off: Search for topics on Facebook relevant to your business and invite people who show up in these searches.Search for groups relevant to your business and join. Some of the groups will first ask some screening questions.As mentioned before \u2026 be very very careful on how you send friend requests. Facebook WILL get its panties in a bunch and lock you out of your account if irregular activity is detected. Posts on Facebook timelines are moderately persistent. People generally get a couple of moments to view before it moves down out of sight on the screen. This means that you will need to repost stuff, but certainly not as frequently as with Twitter. If you would like to know how to get 10 000 likes on Facebook within three to four days, you can contact me. Facebook\u2019s paid advertising is probably the most powerful out there due to the power of demographics that you get to harness. But for now I am going to skip over it. First start making sales before you start spending money on paid advertising, right? Twitter Tweets are the least persistent of all. If you login to Tweetdeck you will be amazed how quickly your timeline moves when you have a sizable amount of followers. This means that you really have to stand out in order to catch the audience\u2019s attention. When you fill out your bio, include some hashtags to make it easier to be discovered. There is plenty of info on the interwebs about hashtags so I am not going to repeat it. What I will mention is to include #SDV and #IFB. You are telling people that you will follow them back if they follow you. (You must actually do it as well, don\u2019t be a prick) This is how mine looks, notice the branding and the use of hashtags: KrossBait (@albie_kross) | Twitter  I recommend using Unfollower Stats :: Track and unfollow your unfollowers! to manage your followers. Follow back all the little darling angels who followed you and unfollow all the ratbastard psychotics who don\u2019t follow you back. Be very careful here, although Twitter doesn\u2019t really care about spam when you post, it does get all PMSsy when you start mass unfollowing people. How do you get Twitter followers: Post some really funny and original tweetsLike and retweet good tweetsEngage with people either by comments or by retweeting and including a comment. Most twits don\u2019t really bother to interact so you can really stand out if you interact regularly.Jump on an SDV train every now and then when it comes along. It is basically a pact between a bunch of people that everybody will retweet a tweet and follow everybody that retweeted. You can pick up quite a few followers like this.I have used a service like Get More Twitter Followers at BestFollowers with varying levels of success.Pintrest Pinterest is great in the sense that your pins don\u2019t disappear, they stay on the boards where you have pinned them. The complete opposite of Twitter, therefore. To gain followers you must pin great content. Have a looksie here krossbait.com (krossbait)  Notice how my boards are organized? One for each marketplace where I am active in that contains the products of that marketplace and then a general board where I pin anything that catches my eye. So there is certainly plenty of eye-candy for visitors to my boards, not just plain old product pins. Then there is a sneaky, yet incredibly powerful way to gain followers - you \u201csteal\u201d them. Search for the hashtag that you are interested in and select \u201cboards\u201d  Now go through each of the people listed below and look for someone with a sizable number of followers i.e. the popular kid on the playground. Click on their followers and start following them one by one. The cool thing is that Pinterest will not get all fascist on you when you do this - they will not lock you out or hard-limit you on your follower/following ratio like Twitter does. All that will happen is that a soft lock is activated after something like 100 follows and you just have to wait for a while before you can follow again.   What you are doing is identifying a popular person with similar interests as yourself (and your shop) and you are asking the people who like their stuff to become a part of your tribe as well. Guess what, they probably won\u2019t mind because they are interested in the topic, right? So you get to put your products in front of people who are already interested. What is more, many of the cool kid\u2019s followers will be small-fry, as can be seen in the above screenshot. They are not online marketers, they are probably just people browsing. The cool kid might not pay any attention back to you but the masses following him or her might just be thrilled that another cool kid is paying attention to them. How cool is that! Quora Quora is my favourite social media platform because its the least creepy and the depth of the engagement is so much more meaningful than on any of the other platforms. The biggest challenge with Quora is that you can\u2019t be too obvious with marketing your stuff. No, you are here to raise awareness by being helpful and you have to tread very carefully not to offend or to be caught spamming. If the Quora mods get you in their visors the consequences are severe. Your posts are either collapsed, deleted or you and all of your content are deleted. Loy Machedo comes to mind \u2026 Posts are fairly persistent in the sense that people tend to see stuff similar to that they have already been looking at. It is not a simple first-in-first-out feed like with Twitter. There are no funny tricks or hacks that I have been able to discover with Quora, it is pretty much based on the strength of the content that you create and how well you interact with others in the comments sections. And of course you can share your answers on Twitter and Facebook. Google + This is the platform that I am the least familiar with, I have only recently started really using it. I am still not entirely convinced that it will be useful but we\u2019ll see. Platforms that I don\u2019t use but that might be worth checking out Reddit Quora kinda replaced Reddit for me. That is not to say that Reddit is no good but I really have stuff to do besides social media. Instagram Yeah, I know its big. But uploading from your phone??? Dealbreaker for me, sorry. Yes I know that there are workarounds but I use my PC as my workstation and if you are going to make it difficult for me to use my PC then I am not all that interested, thank you. Stumbleupon I kinda missed this one, lets see what happens when it moves over to Mix at the end of the month. Posting Strategy First you will need to set up Sassy Social Share on your website (This can be tricky, shout if you need help). You wan to see social sharing icons under your products like illustrated below  The posting strategy basically consists of new content posted on Quora as well as Twitter and then feeding content between the platforms. Some of it is fairly automated and some requires intense manual actions. Share each product to each social platform. Facebook is going to get all cranky and you will have to redo most of your products later when the Facebook anti-spam triggers. Pinterest and Twitter will have no problems. You are going to post once only to Pinterest because once its done its done. With Twitter you should make it a daily activity because you are fighting for attention on the Twitterfeed, right? With Facebook you are probably going to get distracted after the anti-spam triggers and you will forget to go back. But you should try to. Make sure you fill out proper descriptions for your product pins, including hashtags (Pinterest allows up to four). Now go to Twitter and start tweeting original content, retweeting other twits\u2019 tweets , liking and commenting. The stuff that Twitter was supposedly designed for, you know? You can\u2019t just tweet your products because your flock is gonna fly away, you need to keep them entertained. Pin interesting pics in your Twitterfeed. Quora is next. This is going to be your most energy-sapping process because you will have to concentrate about what you post. Good content is key here. Share your post to Facebook and Twitter. Then copy and paste your answer and create a blogpost on your website with your answer. Link your website to Quora where the original answer can be seen. Politely ask on your website for an upvote on Quora if the reader enjoyed the answer. DO NOT LINK THE QUORA ANSWER BACK TO YOUR WEBSITE! It is seen as spam and your answers will be automatically deleted by the mods and good luck appealing their decision. Now go to Pinterest and share your pins to Facebook and Twitter. The process repeats over and over. Promotions Social media works a bit differently than traditional marketing. With traditional marketing you presented your product offer to the market and the market hopefully bought. With social media marketing you first have to work your butt off to create value for people and then after you have taken massive action in order to win trust and goodwill, you can present your products to your audience. Giving away free stuff is a good way to build goodwill and the reason why you are giving it away is because you want email addresses in return. That\u2019s right my darlings, you are busy with listbuilding/email campaign marketing. This is the freebee that I am currently offering in exchange for email addresses: https://bit.ly/2taTs6r   The pic has some animation because I want it to catch the eye of the visitor as soon as a page is opened (you can do some pretty cool .gif animations in Photoshop). I am also offering pretty good value, not only do you get immediate access to an audio story but you also get a discount on selected goodies in the store. Firstly, I chose an audiobook because it is somewhat different than the usual free report/pdf/booklet that is normally offered. Secondly, the discount is a win-win because I would rather sell more stuff at a lower margin than less stuff at a higher margin. I don\u2019t care about stuff like inventory, machine maintenance, staff salaries etc. (Still think it is a good idea do buy printing machines when you are starting out?) The real value for me, of course, is the email address that I score. Because I am going to use that address in my future email marketing campaigns. And before you think that this is something sleazy to do, rest assured, I will not do it in a sleazy way. Each newsletter will be content-orientated with just a small section dedicated to a new product or two. The idea is like this - hey buddy, here is something funny/useful/amusing for you to read/look at. Oh, by the way, we are a shop and we do have products. Would you mind taking a looksie? See? No reason why sales have to be pushy and sleazy. Lets take this post as another example. It took me pretty much 12 hours to write this. I must be a really, really nice person, right? Well I am but that is besides the point. I am hoping to get something out of this. Actually two things: I am hoping to form new business relationships. People might read this and say to themselves \u201cHey, looks like this person actually has somewhat of a clue. Maybe we should ask for help in our business\u201d.I wan to give exposure to the platforms that I am active on.I really want to help people. Only by being valuable to people do we create value for ourselves. And we get paid according to our value.Ok that was three things \u2026 I know. Conclusion So we have covered quite a bit of ground and I am sure that I forgot half of the important stuff. Please do fill the gaps for me by contributing in the comments. And give me a shout if you need help. And let me know in the comments if I should make a video on this. How can I start my own T-shirt business? ",

            "answer_text": "T-shirt printing is a very inexpensive business to start. I would begin as a reseller. This will help you get to know the products, your market and build a good book of business before you spend the cash to buy the equipment yourself. Setup your business and get a reseller license (sales and use license). If you\u2019ve never done that, an attorney or accountant can help. It\u2019s not super difficult though. Once you get that established, you can buy clothing wholesale. My favorite places to buy clothing are SanMar, Heritage Sportswear, and Bodek and Rhodes but there are hundreds of places. Most of these places will have free shipping deals in place if you buy a certain amount or if it\u2019s going to a large decorator. Spend some time learning about the various products that are available. Gildan 2000, a 6.1 oz cotton t-shirt is the most popular product for my customers. Then find some close wholesale decorators otherwise called contract printers. Lots of places will give you as a reseller a discount. Try to get one as close to you as possible because of shipping costs. Once you have your business established and accounts with wholesale garment suppliers and contract printers, start selling. Talk to your local schools, churches, run clubs, anybody who you see with a custom t-shirt or think would want one. When you get your first order, buy your garments from a place like SanMar, ship it to your contract printer along with any artwork you\u2019d like. They\u2019ll print it and either drop-ship it to your client or send it to you, you deliver and invoice and you\u2019re done! Once you build your book of business and you feel comfortable with the process, you\u2019ll want to consider buying equipment and doing the printing yourself. When you\u2019re at that point, that\u2019s a different question altogether! ",
