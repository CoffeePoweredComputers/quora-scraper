            "answer_text": "The question of \u201cHow\u201d this surge of protestant revival in the UK and the US occurred, is easy: men and women with a lot of charisma, stamina, conviction, oratory skill and determination, started spiritual movements, usually relating to the Christian faith, in their own respective regions and were highly successful for a time, in helping many renew, intensify and deepen their spiritual development. As to WHY it occured in the mid to late 18th century, and not earlier or later, this is not an easy question. The popular consensus, however, is that 200 to 250 years on, the protestant revolution was loosing steam and highly organized religious organizations were becoming stagnant, beaurocratic and inflexible in doctrine and structure as they developed\u2026. \u201cmainstream\u201d Christianity increasingly failed to meet and encourage the spiritual development of many, and the \u201cAwakening\u201d was a response to this\u2026. when its time for a change, some folks will nearly always take up the challenge!!
