            "answer_text": "To complement Alan Clement's answer, here what Wikipedia had to say:  T-shirts, made of a light, inexpensive fabric, were easy to clean. The earliest T-shirt dates back to sometime between the Spanish\u2013American War and 1913, when the U.S. Navy began issuing them as undergarments.[2] The word \"T-shirt\" became part of American English by the 1920s, and appeared in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.[2] Following World War II, it became common to see veterans wearing their uniform trousers with their T-shirts as casual clothing. They became even more popular in the 1950s after Marlon Brando wore one in A Streetcar Named Desire, finally achieving status as fashionable, stand-alone, outer-wear garments.[3] Often boys wore them while doing chores and playing outside, eventually opening up the idea of wearing them as general-purpose casual clothing.Printed T-shirts were in limited use by 1942 when an Air Corps Gunnery School T-shirt appeared on the cover of Life magazine. In the 1960s, printed T-shirts gained popularity for self-expression as well for advertisements, protests, and souvenirs.[2] ",
