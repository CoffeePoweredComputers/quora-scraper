            "answer_text": "Actually, a more accurate question would be:  what gave the Confederacy any hope that might succeed?  The Union advantages in the Civil War were significant and probably insurmountable. 1.  The Union had better senior officers.  Oh, I know, that's not the conventional wisdom where a lot of people like to preach about Robert E. Lee.  But the reality is this:  out of the US Regular Army, make a list of who went north and who went south and you'll find that for every really good officer who went with the Confederacy, there were about 3-4 that stayed with the Union.  For every Robert E. Lee, there was a Winfield Hancock, John Reynolds, and Billy Sherman for the Union.  He never got a chance to show it (b/c he was never placed in a dominant role) but John Reynolds was regarded by their peers as no worse than Lee's equal.  If you look at the officers in the Regular Army at the time of the secession, the North got the pick of the litter.  Winfield Scott favored Lee (and so people tend to repeat the praise) but the bulk of the best officers stayed in the Union army.  And officers like Sheridan, Sherman, Thomas, and Lew Wallace performed very well during the war. 2.  The Confederate leadership in the West was inept.  Nathan Bedford Forrest was an amazing commander but got command too late in the West to make a difference.  Patrick Cleburne may have actually been the best Southern Commander in the war (including Lee) but he was killed at Franklin.  Otherwise, the list of senior Confederate commanders in the West was a study in mediocrity and incompetence with a few okay (but not good) senior officers mixed in:  Braxton Bragg, Edmund Kirby Smith, Simon Bolivar Buckner, John Bell Hood, Albert Sydney Johnston, Leonidas Polk, PT Beauregard, Sterling Price, Earl Van Dorn, Richard Taylor...you probably don't recognize more than 1 or 2 of those names but each one was commander of a Confederate Army at one point in the West and all did terribly.  In the history of warfare, it's almost impossible to find such a sustained period of ineptitude as the Confederate forces in the West--over 3 years, they had one tactical victory, one draw and nothing but defeats.  There were some smaller victors by Forrest but they came too little, too late. Why do I focus on the West?  B/c when the Union won in the Western Theater, there was no hope for the Confederacy.  By winning in the west, they split the Confederacy in half (making movement of troops and transport of provisions across the South nearly impossible).  It tied down tens of thousands of confederate soldiers that were badly needed elsewhere (for instance 1/4th of all Georgians who enlisted never left the state during the Civil War).   3.  Manpower.  The Union had more troops.  And then they added the US Colored Infantry (another 200,000 troops, highly motivated and eager to fight).  Meanwhile, every soldier the Confederacy lost, they couldn't replace.Loss of good commanders (like Turner Ashby, Jeb Stuart, Jackson, and Cleburne) was especially bad.  By the end of the war, Lee was having to reply on people like George Pickett and Richard Ewell as his senior commanders (though Gordon was good). 4.  Industry.  But not in the ways most people think.  Yes, the north could produce more shoes, more cannon, more coffee, more minie balls than the Confederacy.  But they also produced more marksmen too.  Let me explain...the stereotype is of Southern country boys and Northern city slickers.  The reality at that point is that 95% of all Americans (north or south) lived in the country.  Most of the troops in both armies were country boys who knew how to hunt.  The difference is that many confederate troops showed up with their family muskets--smoothbore.  And all Union troops were equipped with rifled muskets.  Tests by the same squad firing first smooth bore and then rifled muskets showed that at 300 yards, the smoothbore had an accuracy of 14% while the rifled musket had an accuracy rate of 46%.  And while we're talking about equipment, the Union had much better logistics.  Napoleon famously said that an army marches on it's stomach.  The Northern troops were better supplied than Confederate troops were. 5.  Artillery.  The Union was not just producing more cannon but much better cannon.  And it was better trained and better led.  Union artillery was a huge edge during the war.  At Malvern Hill, the 3rd day at Gettysburg, and at Franklin, Confederate units launched massive assaults against massed Union artillery and failed miserably.  Every time the South faced massed Union artillery, they always were crushed when attacking.  Additionally, during key moments at battles, the Confederate artillery tended to run out of rounds (3rd day at Gettysburg for instance) or didn't have nearly the same dominant affect of the Union artillery. 6.  Inept strategy.  The Union \"Anaconda\" strategy made sense and was effective.  The Confederacy really didn't have a strategy.  Both attempts to invade the North (at Antietam and then Gettysburg) failed on all accounts.  Antietam cost Lee the offensive capability of his best two attacking units (1st Virginia Stonewall Brigade, 1st Texas brigade...both were bled white at that battle and were never powerful attacking units again).  He failed to get Maryland to join the war for the South.  He failed to get new recruits for his army.  At Gettysburg, he destroyed his army as an offensive force and failed to take pressure off of Vicksburg (and once Vicksburg fell, the South was guaranteed to lose the war).   Otherwise, the Southern strategy was to fight on, bleed the Union and hope that they got tired of the war.  This was basically the same strategy of the Japanese during WW-II after Midway:  fight on and hope that the \"weak\" Americans would get tired and offer a truce. 7.  Huge difference in Leadership.  I don't mean the generals (I talked about that in #1).  The reality is that the President of your country makes a big difference.  Jefferson Davis was...meh.  Abraham Lincoln was an amazing combination of integrity and political shrewdness, one of the greatest leaders this country has ever had the good fortune to be blessed with.  If you think I'm exaggerating the difference, think of this:  if Joe Johnston had not been wounded at the battle of Seven Pines, Robert E. Lee probably never would have been given command of a Confederate Army (Davis had put Johnston in command), Richmond likely would have fallen and the Civil War ended 3 years earlier. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly? Stupidity. Since I\u2019m hopelessly outnumbered on here, I can only say \u201cthe way I was told\u201d for this. The way I was told, not in any Yankee history books, is that the South wanted to be left alone. The vote was taken and 13 states opted to leave the \u201cunion.\u201d When Lincoln invaded, we choose to fight a limited war, simply to drive the union out of the states that had sided with the Confederacy. The way I was taught, this was not a Civil War. In a civil war, two sides are fighting for control of the government. In other words, this would have been a civil war IF both the North and South were fighting for control of Washington. It wasn\u2019t. The South cared not for Washington or the North. All that was wanted was the states that seceded from the Union. In fact, they set up the capital as Richmond, VA, just across the river from DC. In modern terms, \u201cscrew Washington.\u201d So, when southern troops got within shot of Washington, rather than taking DC, they left. Major screw up. Looking back, we should have pushed into Washington and captured it and Lincoln, ending the war right then and there. Instead, we returned to CS soil and let the invaders invade again. This gave them time to secure the ports and stop imports that were vital to the South. At the start of the war, we were vastly superior to the North\u2019s troops when it came to marksmanship and horsemanship. With loss of the ports, we lost fresh weapons, food, horses, and other supplies that were not only needed for the troops but also for the civilians that Lincoln starved to death and later that Sherman starved in his \u201cscorched earth\u201d policy to break Southern moral. If the South had pushed on, we would not have done this to the North. Lee controlled his troops, unlike Grant and Sherman. We were to see how the Union fought in the Indian Wars, where genocide was the order of the day. ",
