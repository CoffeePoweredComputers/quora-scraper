            "answer_text": "Barrel length does not play an important role in the accuracy of a firearm and increasing barrel length does literally nothing to increase mechanical accuracy. Barrel stiffness plays an important role in mechanical accuracy because when a barrel heats and cools, minute changes in the precise shape of the barrel as well as the way the barrel vibrates as bullets are accelerated through the barrel are among the main mechanical causes of bullets deviating from their expected flight path and being less accurate. With that in mind, shorter and thicker barrels which have less opportunity to change shape or droop will always be more mechanically accurate than longer or thinner barrels of equal quality. Optimal barrel lengths vary wildly in terms of precise length depending on the exact model of firearm being used in conjunction with the exact type of ammunition being used. In general, an optimal barrel length in terms of accuracy will be as short as possible while still achieving consistent propellant burn volumes to ensure all bullets leave the barrel at the same velocity as well as achieving consistent gyroscopic stabilization, which is normally not a concern at all because gyroscopic stabilization occurs within the length of a bullet\u2019s bearing surface with a barrel\u2019s rifling except in progressively rifled barrels. With that being said, increased barrel length does typically increase bullet velocity because bullets have a longer time to accelerate which in turn helps bullets get to targets faster and fall less due to the force of gravity while in flight. While increased bullet velocity isn\u2019t inherently tied to accuracy, it does decrease the amount of bullet drop which might have to be compensated for, which improves accuracy in the sense that it\u2019s easier to aim. Additionally, if iron sights mounted to the barrel are being used, an increased sight radius decreases possible errors in sight alignment and increasing barrel length is one possible method of increasing sight radius. With that being said, with the current increasingly prevalent use of optical sights and continually decreasing use of iron sights, increasing barrel length to increase sight radius isn\u2019t an especially good trade off. Iron sights should only be used as a backup sighting method due to drastically better optical sights being readily accessible and affordable. Finally, if you\u2019re looking for a maximum barrel length to stay under, knowing that extra barrel length can grant gains in bullet velocity but not necessarily accuracy, try to stay under 24 inches (609.6 millimeters) in total barrel length including muzzle devices like flash hiders or sound suppressors for rifles or shotguns and under 6 inches (152.4 millimeters) for pistols. Beyond those barrel lengths, guns become really unwieldy and bang into things a lot when being carried. ",

            "answer_text": "In terms of ballistics Jon Kelley\u2019s answer is correct. But I\u2019ll give you another consideration. A barrel can become too long when it makes the gun cumbersome or unwieldy for its intended role or purpose. If you\u2019re dealing with a concealed carry pistol, then maybe 5 inches is too long. But a pistol you carry for hunting, you might want 10\u201312 inches, for the same caliber. (The most common calibers for concealed carry don\u2019t necessarily get used for hunting that often, but it could happen, and the point remains.) Heck, the concept of the carbine came about for similar reasons. A full length rifle barrel was just too long to be handy on horseback. Similarly, a rifle you intend to carry when hunting in heavy brush or in the woods probably needs to be shorter barreled than the one you take Elk hunting in Colorado\u2019s wide open spaces, just so you can walk without hitting every branch in sight. Oh, and a correction. Barrel length isn\u2019t really inherently important in terms of accuracy. Sight radius is - in terms of the ability for a shooter to be accurate with the weapon. But as long as the barrel is straight and the sights are properly aligned, it\u2019s going to go where the barrel is pointed, even with a shorter barrel. It\u2019s only at longer ranges where the added velocity a long barrel allows becomes particularly relevant to accuracy, as higher velocity leads to flatter trajectories and less wind deflection. ",

            "answer_text": "someone asked nearly the same question a few months ago\u2026 I suggest you do a search for the thread. Here was my answer: \u201cI\u2019m probably going to ruffle some feathers with this response; but the fact is, barrel length does not equate to accuracy. Anyone who claims that a particular barrel length will provide the greatest accuracy for a given rifle/round is either grossly over-simplifying the issue (to a fault) or does not fully understand the factors at play here. ***Note: I am going to keep this discussion as simple as possible and I am going to try and minimize the technical jargon, in an effort to make this comprehensible for as many people as possible. Further, I asm not going to get deep into the weeds on all of the technical aspects and contributing factors. People have written entire books on this subject. If you would like for me to explain something further, or go deeper into a given topic, please ask and I will do my best to respond. If you are one of those trolls who likes to nit-pick people\u2019s responses to try and show everyone how \u201csmart\u201d you are\u2026 please spare me; its juvenile and boring.*** There is a lot of \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d on the topic of what is the optimal barrel length for various calibers. However, these optimal barrel lengths optimize VELOCITY NOT ACCURACY (Velocity is not accuracy and velocity does not create accuracy). Further, these \u201crules of thumb\u201d are just that\u2026 broad generalities that are not universally correct. For example, one of the other respondents claimed that a barrel length that produces \u201conly a small muzzle flash\u201d (thereby optimizing the amount of powder burned from the cartridge) will optimize accuracy. While this does ensure that the potential of the charge (the load of powder in the cartridge) is optimized, it does not take powder burn rate into account (ie. a fast-burning powder vs. a slow burning powder). Firing a cartridge with a faster burning powder will allow you to burn more powder and increase your velocity (within the pressure limits of your rifle) over a slower burning load, while producing the same muzzle flash. So, even when we limit the discussion to the proper metric, it is still clearly imprecise. All of that said\u2026 does velocity have an effect on the accuracy of any given projectile? Yes, it does. However, increasing the velocity of any given projectile is not necessarily going to improve its accuracy. It is far more complicated than that. Also, the velocity loss, per inch of barrel is likely much less significant than one would expect. Numerous studies have been done on this, many of which can be easily found on the internet. An effective discussion on the interplay between velocity and accuracy is going to be far too expansive and complicated (and boring) for this forum. So, let me offer three different case studies that completely disprove the conventional wisdom, regarding optimal barrel length for any given caliber/round, instead. The first is an experiment that was conducted by Todd Hodnett (President of Accuracy 1st, regular contributor to SNIPER Magazine as well as numerous blogs and such, and world renown firearms instructor). He did a test on the .338 Lapua, where he started with a 27\u2033 barrel and kept cutting it down, 1\u2033 at a time, all the way to 18\u2033\u2026 conducting accuracy tests at every length. He found that the \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d did not hold. To this day, does not go longer than a 20\u201d barrel on any of his bolt guns. (I will try to dig up the article and provide a link for it). The second is a parallel experiment that was conducted by Dan Zimmerman (Managing Editor of Truth About Guns). I really don\u2019t know anything about this guy, so I\u2019m not vouching for him as any kind of an expert on the topic (though he may very well be). I\u2019m simply including his article because it is remarkably similar to Todd\u2019s experiment; it provides comparable results with an even more common caliber; and I have a link to the article for you to reference if you wish. Anyway, he did his experiment on a .308 bolt gun with a 27\u2033, 18\u2033, 16\u2033 and 13.5\u2033 barrel\u2026 he also tested with numerous different bullets and at various distances. His test also disproved the belief that longer barrels are inherently more accurate. His article is an easy read and provides supporting data; it can be seen here: The Truth About Barrel Length, Muzzle Velocity and Accuracy - The Truth About Guns The last case study I will offer is one of my own personal rifles. I built a Stiller Tac-30 Short Action, in .308 cal., with an 18\u2033 Bartlein (1:8 RH twist, sendero contour) barrel, on a McMillan Ultralight stock. According to \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d this rifle should not be able to hit the broad side of a barn\u2026 and I\u2019ve had more \u201cexpert\u201d shooters tell me so than I can count. Shooting Federal Gold Medal Match 175gr HPBT (factory ammunition), I am shooting sub- 1/3 MOA groups (that means that all of the bullet holes will fit INSIDE of a dime at 100 yards). When I develop a hand load for the rifle, that group size will likely be even smaller. Other folks have brought up other factors that effect the accuracy of a rifle, like barrel thickness and twist rate. Here are some things to consider with respect to those factors: Barrel Weight: When you fire your rifle, the barrel vibrates/oscillates at a particular frequency (like a sine wave). So, as the barrel oscillates, the direction that the muzzle it is pointed actually changes. Where the barrel is in its phase (the exact point in its cycle of oscillation), when the projectile exits it, will effect the trajectory. A lighter barrel will have a relatively greater amplitude of its oscillation (height of the sine wave) and, therefore, have the potential for a greater deviation in the trajectory of the projectile. So, a heavier barrel reduces the POTENTIAL deviation, but does not necessarily reduce the ACTUAL deviation. The more \u201cconsistent\u201d your ammunition is (measured by standard deviation) the less of an effect this oscillation will have. More consistent ammunition will leave the barrel at a more consistent point in the phase of oscillation (the closer to the center/0, the better). So, if you are shooting hand loads and/or good match-grade ammunition, some of this effect will be mitigated. That said, by experimenting with the load, you can find a round that exits the muzzle as close to the center/0 of the phase of oscillation as possible. So, a heavier barrel can potentially reduce deviation from barrel oscillation and increase accuracy. Shooting high-quality ammunition can potentially reduce deviation from barrel oscillation and increase accuracy. Finding a round that is \u201ctuned\u201d to your rifle can potentially reduce deviation from barrel oscillation and increase accuracy. Doing two of these things will have a greater effect. Doing all three will have the greatest effect. Your priorities and needs should determine which (if any of these things you do). For example, if you do not want the weight that goes along with a heavy barrel, don\u2019t buy one! If your groups aren't tight enough, experiment with your ammunition and find a load that works better with what you have. Twist Rate: Todd Hodnett has written several articles challenging the \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d regarding twist rates (\u201cThe Future of Twist Rates\u201d SNIPER Magazine 2013, being the best example). Depending on what you are shooting (projectile and distance), you could benefit significantly from a faster twist rate.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Actually , given appropriate Barrel stiffness and rifling twist and barrel bedding, barrel length plays little role in basic firearm accuracy. When using iron sights, a long barrel allows for a longer sight radius which indeed adds to accuracy, but that\u2019s not really Barrel related. With good optics a 18 or 19 inch barrel can provide as good accuracy as longer barrels. Short Barrel snub nosed Handguns, test fired from a mechanical rest which removes human error from the equation , have been demonstrated to be as mechanically accurate as 6\u201d and 8\u201d barrelled Guns. The problem with snub nose accuracy is that it is harder for a human to shoot them accurately , again that sight radius thing, but they are generally not mechanically less accurate. ",
