            "answer_text": "Let me write some extreme and off topic ideas here and you are welcome to report me anytime you want. Most religious activities represent nothing but stupidity. From what I can see, religions often try their best to set moral values for people. Someone thinks it's nice, some doesn't. I, fortunately, belong to the later group. You see, moral values change, you can't stick to the same stupid book for thousands of years. 5000 years ago, human eating and human sacrificing were considered moral. 3000 years ago, trading slaves was considered moral. 1500 years ago, burning witches on a cross was considered moral. 1000 years ago, shitting on the street was considered moral. 500 years ago, murdering homosexual people was considered moral. Most religions claim that they represent ultimate morality. That claim itself is stupid enough. Do above things today, then see what happens to you. You can't burn or boom someone to death just because he/she doesn't believe your fucking book. That\u2019s why we criticise ISIS. You might say that they are extremists, but no, they are not. Put them back in 7th centry, they are perfectly moral. They are doing nothing but sticking to the same old, fucked up, uesless book. Any religion with an omnipresent and omnipotent God like Jesus or Allah is doomed, they can't change what their holy book says, and eventually part of it will become anti human. I am so glad that China didn't develop such system. Guess what our domestic religion Taoism believe? \u2018Believe or fuck off, I am going to be immortal through training.\u2019 ",

            "answer_text": "Why don\u2019t people learn something about China and Confucianism before asking questions like these? China has developed religions, Taoism and Chan Buddhism, plus various regional worship of local gods. Confucianism does allow for the existence of gods. Chinese people worshipped the spirits of their ancestors as well as Heaven. They just weren\u2019t arrogant enough to assign human characteristics to Heaven. Confucianism maintained that gods and spirits cannot be known (\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u8bba), so they were agnostic in their regards towards gods. Since they cannot be known, they were not relevant in discussions of temporal matters like state policy and personal morality. They were respected, but kept at a distance for day-to-day matters (\u656c\u9b3c\u795e\u800c\u8fdc\u4e4b). Confucianist moral ideals include filial piety (\u5b5d) and love and benevolence for everyone, including strangers (\u56db\u6d77\u4e4b\u5185\uff0c\u7686\u5144\u5f1f\u4e5f). If you want to claim that religion is the master of morality and throne, perhaps educate yourself on the history of the crusades and the treatment of Jewish people throughout European history. ",
