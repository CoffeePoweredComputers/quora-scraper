            "answer_text": "It was the last chunk of dirt in the contiguous, continental land mass that wasn\u2019t a state. There weren\u2019t very many people here and we couldn\u2019t count the Native Americans so we didn\u2019t quite qualify. Out of pity, the powers in Washington said \u201cCount every miner, rancher, cowboy, bar keeper, faro dealer, and scoundrel that you can find anywhere in that godforsaken country and round up their numbers so that there are enough people there to make it a state!!\u201d. Arizona submitted a couple of drafts of a state constitution that did not pass muster with the powers that be in Washington DC but finally we agreed on a State Constitution. So on February 14, 1912 Arizona became officially a State. Otherwise Arizona would have stood in the way of Hawaii and Alaska ever becoming states. How Arizona almost didn't become a state The United States didn't want Arizona. Congress only begrudgingly named it a territory in the first place, and to gain statehood -- joining the 47 others -- was too grand a gesture for this rude, crude land in the Southwestern desert filled with scoundrels and ne're-do-wells. Just ask anyone east of the Missouri River from 1856 until 1912. That's 56 long years; over five decades of wanting and petitioning and planning and building and praying. So, when statehood finally came on Feb. 14, 1912, the party was something spectacular to behold. . . . \"We prefer to remain a territory indefinitely rather than lose our identity,\" read a petition. The Phoenix City Council was so mad that President Theodore Roosevelt seemed to give tacit approval of jointure that it changed the name of Roosevelt Street to Cleveland Street (but would eventually change it back again.) Arizona started calling itself the \"47th state\" in anticipation of things turning around, and in 1910, they finally did. Congress overcame its fears and told the territory to write a constitution. Arizona's Constitutional Convention opened on Oct. 10, 1910, and ran for 60 days, producing what was then considered either \"one of the most progressive\" constitutions of any state, or \"socialistic and undemocratic.\" It did not include voting rights for women but did include the initiative, referendum and recall, including the recall of judges that President William Howard Taft had warned he would never approve. While some in Arizona, including its newspapers, claimed the entire effort was \"all for naught\" because of the recall, voters loved the constitution, passing it on Feb. 9, 1911, by 12,534 to 3,920. Taft upheld his promise and vetoed the constitution, telling the Arizona Territory it would never be admitted with that provision. Arizona responded like an obedient child, removing the recall of judges and going back to voters, who approved the sanitized constitution. Arizona was approved for statehood but would face one more disappointment. It had hoped to be admitted on Feb. 12, the birthday of President Lincoln, who remained a state champion for making it a territory in the first place. But Taft was busy then and didn't sign until Valentine's Day on Feb. 14, 1912. Meanwhile, New Mexico, which didn't tinker with Taft's rules on a constitution, was admitted as the 47th state on Jan. 6, 1912, making Arizona the 48th. Ditat Deus - God enriches (and looks kindly on these sun drenched scoundrels) ",

            "answer_text": "Robert, that\u2019s a great question. The answer appears to be language. According to veteran New Mexico reporter Leslie Linthicum, New Mexico first petitioned to join the union in 1850 after forming a state constitution. In the 62 years between the original petition and admittance, New Mexico was frequently in the running as 16 other states, from Minnesota to Montana, were admitted. The deciding difference? According to Linthicum: \u201cOn the plus side, New Mexico met and exceeded the population requirement, it had established public schools and developed a strong livestock industry. On the negative side, New Mexico was predominantly Hispano, its adults were largely illiterate and its language and culture were very different from the \u201cAmericans\u201d who were deciding who would join them as a nation.\u201d I do know that New Mexico would not accept admittance unless a provision in its constitution making Spanish and English both the official languages of the state was accepted, and it was in 1912. Esto es verdad. O, ellos mi dijernon que estos is verdad. Y Leslie Linthicum. ",
