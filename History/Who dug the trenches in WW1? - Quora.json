            "answer_text": "The vast majority of the trenches and fortifications used in all theaters of the war (Western Front, Eastern Front, Balkan, Mesapotamia, Sinai etc.) were dug by the soldiers themselves. After the war of movement ended and trench warfare began on the Western Front after the First Battle of the Aisne (13 - 28 September, 1914), digging trenches became essential to a soldier\u2019s survival, so most of them became very good at it. As Ernst Junger, one of Germany\u2019s most decorated WWI veterans put it, \u201cthe work of maintaining and building fortifications took up most of a soldiers time\u201d, \u201cmuch of a trench warrior\u2019s day was spent building, repairing and taking turns on watch with occasional breaks for meals and sleep\u201d. Trenches needed constant maintenance. Water had to be constantly pumped out (a daily chore during the fall and spring months), the walls (often 8\u201312ft tall on either side) had to be reinforced with wood and repaired when they took damage from shelling. Underground bunkers and dugouts had to be built and repaired. The communication trenches that led from the frontline trenches out to the rear also had to be clear of debris. Enemy artillery and mortar fire was constant, even in \u201cquiet\u201d areas of the front, so there was always damage to be repaired and work to be done. Soldiers were trained in digging and basic carpentry but what helped enormously was the fact that many of them were carpenters and builders in civilian life and they were able show their comrades the proper way to get stuff done. Below: German soldiers on watch   Above: Typical front line fortifications As you can see, these structures can get pretty elaborate. These guys were pros at what they did. Anyway sorry if that was a bit long, I hope it helps regardless! Also check out the Great War series on youtube if you want to know more, great stuff.
