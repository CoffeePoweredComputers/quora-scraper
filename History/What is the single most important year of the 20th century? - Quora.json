            "answer_text": "I would have to select 1945, because it represented the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. In January of that year, the Nazi Holocaust was still ongoing, as SS troops coerced 60,000 Jewish prisoners to go on a forced march that left almost 15,000 people dead. In February, Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Josef Stalin hold the Yalta Conference where they make preparations for the post-Nazi world order, but the U.S. didn\u2019t know yet that their delegation included Soviet spies. In the same month, the American invasion begins as U.S. troops plant an American flag on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. By April, Allied troops liberate several Nazi concentration camps, the Italian resistance executes Benito Mussolini, FDR dies suddenly of a heart attack, and Hitler kills himself in his bunker as the Third Reich collapses. The following month, the Soviet Army announces the fall of Berlin, an event which leads to Germany being split in half between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. On May 8, Nazi Germany surrenders, ushering in V-E Day, which officially ends World War II in Europe. In June, the United Nations Charter is drafted to create a framework for the new postwar order, a safeguard to prevent any war on the scale of World War I or World War II from happening again. In July, the U.S. completes the first successful test of an atomic bomb, making nuclear war a possibility for the first time. In August, the U.S. drops atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which convinces the Japanese government to surrender only a day after the bombing of Nagasaki. In September, Ho Chi Minh takes advantage of the defeat of the Japanese to announce the formation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This event was not noticed much by the United States citizenry at the time, but it paved the way for the U.S. to get entangled in the Vietnam War over a decade later. By October, new nations start rebelling against the former colonial masters and military occupiers. Mahatma Gandhi and Jawarhalal Nehru demand Britain to leave India. Mongolia votes for independence from China, and Indonesians start fighting against English and Dutch colonial troops. In November, the Allies begin the Nuremberg trials against the Nazi leaders for their crimes against humanity, but lower-ranking Nazi scientists are left off the hook, because the United States needs them to help build a rocketry program to fight the Soviet Union. In December, the World Bank is created, which creates a financial underpinning for the new international regime that emerged after the defeat of the Nazis. Before 1945, the United States was a relatively co-equal partner with Great Britain. After 1945, the United States becomes the world\u2019s undisputed democratic capitalist superpower. Before 1945, many nations and ethnic groups had to put their aspirations for independence on hold while the Great Powers fought a world war. After 1945, new nationalist movements form, and Great Britain sees the beginning of the end of its empire. Before 1945, the United States and the Soviet Union were allies in the fight against Nazi fascism. After 1945, the United States and the Soviet Union were the primary superpower rivals in the world, engaged in long, drawn-out \u201ccold war.\u201d In short, the year 1945 was the most important year of the 20th century, because almost nothing before that era was the same as it was after that era.

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a hard question. I would say one of the years that the world wars began or ended, as those wars really shaped the whole century. But in the second half of the 20th Century, 1989 was the most important year: it marked the end of the Cold War with the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the failure of social/political reforms in China. Those two events determined the geopolitical environment we now live in. The 20th Century was a time of ideological conflict, between liberal democracy and other political ideologies, most notably fascism and communism. 1989 marked the triumph of liberal democracy, and the beginning of a brief period of ideological consensus, throughout Europe at least. Some historians even talked about the \u2018end of history.\u2019 Then, in September 2001, a new ideological conflict began (or you could say returned) between radical Islam and the (mostly secular) West, which has so far defined the early 21st Century. I\u2019d like to add: historians sometimes talk about the \u2018Long 19th Century\u2019 which lasted from 1789 to 1914. I would say that the 20th Century really lasted from 1914 to 1989 or 1991. ",
