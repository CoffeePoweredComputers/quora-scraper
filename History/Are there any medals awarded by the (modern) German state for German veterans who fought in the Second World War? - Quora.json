            "answer_text": "German veterans of WW2 had of course in many cases been awarded Orders/medals/badges during the war. Problem was that most of them had the swastika as part of their design. Also, some were awarded by organizations that were declared illegal after the war ie: the SS, SA, HJ, etc. In other words nazi organizations\u2026 not the legal German army, navy and air forces, etc. Some veterans had the offending symbol removed or did so themselves so they could continue to wear their awards on such occasions that required that. When West German was again permitted to have a military, primarily to act as our ally and to counter Soviet block forces many who had served in WW2 joined the new services. In 1959 a law was passed which basically allowed the legal reissue of awards from WW2 to German veterans, having been redesigned to remove the swastika. The German government did not reissue the awards per se, but the veterans could purchase them, showing their documents to prove their entitlement to said awards. They could be worn on their new uniforms in service to the West German state. These awards are collectible being in three main categories. Early, high quality made with some original pieces made and left over from WW2, Middle, being early made but still quality pieces for the most part. Late, being of lesser quality and getting to the point where they are shadows of their former selves. No WW2 veterans have served for quite some time so these later awards are primarily made for novice collectors. Early and middle ones, especially if named are sought after. You can find many pictures and much information on the web in general and on military collecting forums as well. You can also find these on say Ebay and such but the majority are current (late) production and much of it is simply junk. The early and some middle ones were indeed worn by the vets and therefore are actual awards with some history behind them. ",
