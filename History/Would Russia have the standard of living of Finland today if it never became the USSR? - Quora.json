            "answer_text": "It is hard to say because a lot of changes appeared from the 1917 Empire of Russia to the 2017 Federation of Russia. Plus unlike the tiny homogenous and underpopulated Finland, Russia is gigantic spanning from Black and Baltic Seas to Pacific Ocean with 16 borders, 11 times zone and 150 millions inhabitants, the most populated country in Europe. Don\u2019t get me wrong I know people density in Finland is twice as much as Russia, but still I\u2019m talking about people, about ethnic groups, religious, disparities, etc. Finland is a very homogenous country with a 5 millions inhabitants which is easy to control, to educate, etc. In 1917 Russia was of course flamboyant and very European\u2026 in St-Petersburg or Moscow, but a significant part of the population was analphabetic, many populations in rural areas, particularly in Siberia and Russian Far East, were asbolutely miserable, the serfdom was abolished in 1861 and in 1871 in some provinces, etc\u2026 In 1890\u2019s Imperial Russia population was 122 millions (which is a bit misleading because it incorporated territories that are no longer Russian now). USA population at the same period was about 68 millions and people were much more educated than Russians on average. My point is that is possible that Russia would enjoy Western high standards of living such as Finland in 2017 if USSR never happened. That said it\u2019s also possible that the huge disparities that existed during the Imperial era would still exist nowadays. ",

            "answer_text": "No. It is highly unlikely that it would be the same. It could be higher or lower \u2013 I don\u2019t want to start a flame war here - but a like-for-like progression would be impossible for the following reasons: We (us Finns and our neighbours Russians) have a different religion and culture. We are mostly Protestants, them Orthodox. (Although the importance of religion has diminished througout the years, a 100 years ago it made a difference.) We have a high common cultural background with the Swedes, they don\u2019t. Ethnically, Finns are a part of a small Finno-Ugric group, the Russians are Slavs. We use Latin script (=letters), they use Cyrillic. And there are many other differences that all add up to: No, the standard of living would be different. To be clear, I assumed that with Russia you meant the area populated by ethnic Russians: excluding the many parts of Imperial Russia that have become independent since 1917, and the areas of current Russia that also have different ethnicities and cultures. In the highly unlikely scenario that Imperial Russia had stayed intact, the economies of course would have stayed much more similar. ",
