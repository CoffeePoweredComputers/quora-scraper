            "answer_text": "if she controls sex, she controls the husband (as long as he dont go cheating on her) so in my house my wife charges me for sex, blowjobs,handjobs,i even have to pay to lick her pussy. it started as a joke she wasnt getting any satisfaction from my small penis so wasnt really interested in sex but i need it very frequently so 1 time in desperation i said i will pay her and she was semi horny herself so she agreed.after that it became a regular thing and she liked making me pay for it, it made her feel strong and in control. that was a few of years ago these days its the normal in our house shes got a price list and she increases rates every year also charges a small penis tax which also has been going up annually. she keeps a record of everything we do and on pay day i get a bill from her and i transfer the money into her account. if she aint happy with me, if i have upset her or havent done my share of household stuff she will punish me by with holding sex she has chastity devices etc that she will use, or she will add a extra premium for sex (upset wives cost double-is what she normally says). for us its working nicely i get all the sex i want and for her its like a extra part time job she makes a few hundred pounds per month and she dont even have to dip into her normal salary and shes got me under her control. even now im being extra nice to her so hopefully next months rate review increases wont be hefty lol.

I understand they\u2019re more cooperative than the live models who will eat you out of house and home $10 at at time\u2026  \u2026and make you a slave to scrubbing stains out of their skivvies.  However, aside from giving you a run for your money, when Rob the 6-thousand-dollar-man gets old, you can trade him in for a newer model without the expense of divorce! Other than that, he\u2019s like the real thing as he never moves from the couch and he won\u2019t take out the trash either! ;) My apologies to anyone unintentionally offended. ",
