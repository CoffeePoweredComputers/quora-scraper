            "answer_text": "This answer is only about books on the Second World War :  Anthony Beevor's account \"The Second World War - Anthony Beevor\" is good to start reading about WW2. It reads like a very interesting story, and introduces you to the main events, milestones, and strategic milestones of the War. I found this to be a gripping book, and couldn't bring myself to put it down and i am sure you will too. The Second World War by Antony Beevor: review - Telegraph This is for the reader who wants to understand the War from a new reader perspective. This book reads like a story, and is exciting, enthralling and makes you want to keep turning the pages. If you don't have a good view about the important strategic actions of the War, and generally want to learn about it from the beginning, this is the best book for you. However, if you've been reading regularly about events in the Second World War, are aware of the main strategic events, alliances, key actions, and wish to have a more in-depth, \"human account\" of the war, then i thoroughly recommend Max Hasting's Inferno A.K.A All Hell Let Loose - The World at War 1939-1945 Max Hasting's account relies on his deep study of the human, strategic and historical events of the War, and he has presented several high quality, poignant accounts from people's recollections, journals, writings that give you a good human perspective of the War. This is one of the BEST books i've ever read. Highly recommended. All Hell Let Loose by Max Hastings \u2013 review If you wish to contrast the two books, here's a good place to do so Amazon.com:      Lake's review of The Second World War But don't just read the reviews! Go ahead, buy one of these books. I assure you that you'll really enjoy it, and would definitely be moved by the masterful accounts. I have had the great opportunity to read Cornelius Ryan's \"The Last Battle\" that describes  the invasion of Berlin in stark, recent terms (not historical - this was written about twenty years after, and Ryan has had the opportunity to interview a lot of survivors) during my formative years. It was a very depressing read for a 13 year old boy, but it was definitely the one source that kindled my interest in the history of the World.  I'd recommend his much more popular \"The Longest Day\" to you, for an account of the D-Day invasion, although Anthony Beevor does a great job at it too, but Ryan does a deeper, more recent look (this book was written a generation before the above two)  The Longest Day: D-Day book re-released - Telegraph Start with Mr. Beevor if you must, but in your lifetime, definitely make time for these two. Cheers, and Happy reading! ",
