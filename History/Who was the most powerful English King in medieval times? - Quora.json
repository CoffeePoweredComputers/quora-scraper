            "answer_text": "Depends on how you define medieval, but my money is on Henry II. He built an empire that included Ireland, England, and about half of what we now consider France, including the richest province, Aquitaine. He was a smart and active king, skilled in both warfare and diplomacy. He also made a number of reforms to English law. He left his empire to his son Richard the Lionheart, who died young and without any children. Richard left it to his younger brother John, who was cruel and rapacious and lost almost all of the French part in wars with the King of France. ",

            "answer_text": "My money would have to be on Henry II, because he was an English (not British) King who directly controlled the largest territory (I'll assume that to be the type of power you mean). Henry II was King of England, a large part of Ireland, and slightly more than half of France. It was a few Kings later that we lost France, and got stuff like Magna Carta, that first put any form of limitations on the absolute power of the monarchy up to then. ",
