            "answer_text": "Not exactly. The Italians are the product of centuries of invasions and mixtures between peoples. The Sabines, together with the Etruscans, the Latins, the Aequi, the Ligurians, the Samnites, the Sabellians and the Hernics, among others, were ancient peoples who inhabited pre-Roman Italy. Its origin can not be determined with certainty, but it is believed that they were in Lazio since prehistory and, once the Republic was established, they were assimilated to the culture and became citizens of Rome. According Virgilius they were linked to the Trojan legend of the creation of Rome.  To populate the newly created city, R\u00f3mulo accepted all types of refugees and uprooted from neighboring cities, of Latin origin. The colony was formed entirely by men, but to build a city women were also needed. They then placed their eyes on the daughters of the Sabines, who inhabited the neighboring hill of the Quirinal. Rome was founded on April 21, 753 a. C.  To get hold of them, Latinos organized a big party, with chariot races and banquets, and when the Sabines were overcome by the vapors of wine, they kidnapped their women to build families.  The Roman Empire became so big that there were a lot of different people with different cultures living in it. So you can\u2019t really say there was one way of living in the Roman Empire. There were many different ways of living. Families living in the Roman Empire took many different forms. In general, there was more equality between men and women under Roman law than there was under the Greeks or under West Asian law. But there was more equality in the western part of the Empire, in Europe and North Africa (including Egypt), than there was in the east, in West Asia. There, most people followed West Asian and Greek traditions.  People of minority races or cultures probably were more comfortable under the Roman Empire than they were before or after. There were people of so many different cultures travelling around the empire interacting with each other that there seems to have been a lot of tolerance for other cultures. On the other hand, this contact did also cause tension. Sometimes that tension burst out into violent persecutions of minority groups.  People were forced into slavery in every corner of the Roman empire, from the beginning to the end. But again the kind of slavery and the way enslaved people were treated depended on where you were and also on when. In Italy and Sicily, and maybe in some other places, big farms were worked by slave field-hands, who were very badly treated.  Other slaves were house servants, like nannies, nurses, cooks, laundry-women, and stable-boys who took care of the horses. A lot of enslaved people also worked for the Roman government, or for private businesses, as managers, or running a shop, or in small factories. Still other enslaved people were criminals who had been sentenced to work in the mines or other hard labor as punishment. Even if they were freed, people who had once been enslaved still didn\u2019t have the same rights as other people, but their children did, if they had been born free.  All over the Roman empire, many boys in cities probably went to school. Some girls went too, but most girls were not allowed to go to school. Out in the countryside, in small villages, probably hardly anyone could read or write. Very few people went to college, but those that did often travelled far from home, to Athens or Alexandria in Egypt, for a good education.  Partly at school, and partly through their families or just playing ball games outside, kids all over the Roman empire did have lots of friends.  Girls and boys from rich families, however, were not allowed to get romantic together. Most marriages among the upper classes were arranged by the parents. It was probably different, and more like today, for the poor.  In addition to this initial population structure, the \"pure\" Romans mix their race with that of the invaders through history. The Etruscans, in central Italy (Tuscany and northern Lazio), eighth century BC a.C. - 1st century BC;The ancient Greeks, in southern Italy and Sicily, 8th century BC C. - 290/280 a. C.;The Romans, who dominated all of Italy from the 1st century BC until the fall of the Western Empire;Several barbarian peoples, from the IVth to the VI century AD;The Longobards, mainly in Northern Italy during the High Middle Ages (6th-7th centuries AD);The Byzantines, mainly in the South of Italy and in Ravenna during the high Middle Ages (6th-7th centuries AD);The Arabs, in Sicily (from 827 until the fall of Noto in 1091);The Franks, in central and northern Italy (8th-9th centuries AD). His most important emperors, Carlo Magno, founded the Holy Roman Empire;The Normans, from 1000 to 1194 in Sicily and southern Italy;The Svevos (of present-day Germany) in the 12th century and later the Angioini (in present-day France), in Sicily and southern Italy;From the second half of the XVI century to the end of the XVII century the Spanish domination, direct or indirect in almost all Italy;In the 18th century and in the 19th century the Asburga (Austrian) domination, direct or indirect, in a large part of Northern Italy andThe Napoleonic domination, in almost all Italy from 1796 to 1814. All these invasions and migrations produced ties of blood with the original races to give the characteristics of the Italians at the beginning of the XX Century. Advanced the current Century, it is not restricted knowledge that there is a second Islamic invasion ~silent and peaceful~ over all of Europe, as well as the influx of black populations that settled everywhere ~fleeing from misery and war in their lands~ and that today are part, if you will, of the Italian typology.

            "answer_text": "It's extremely likely, though of course all sorts of things could change the picture.  We can only talk about averages and probabilities:  if, in fact, you're descended from a couple that moved to Italy from Germany in the 15th century to work in the woolen mills of Florence -- or one that came from Libya in the 1960s -- the statistics are very different.  At it's peak in the late first and early second centuries Rome had a nominal population of over a million.  'Italy' -- not quite synonymous with the modern nation-state but close enough for horseshoes -- had a population of  8 million or so: Rome, therefore, accounted for something between 12 and 15 % of the population of the peninsula.   A modern Italian has  between 67 and 82 generations of ancestors to get back to the age of  Julius Caesar in 46 BC, depending on whether you choose to use 25 or 30 years as a generation.  Either way, that's a lot of ancestors.   Exactly how many is very hard to actually figure out. For, say, 67 generations the 'theoretical' number of ancestors is 1.1805916e+21 -- that, a 1.18 followed by 21 zeros.  82 generations is about 32,000 times more than that.  Adds up fast...  In practice, though, the overwhelming  majority of those trillions of slots are actually duplicates: the further back you go, there more frequently you are descended from the same person through multiple lines (this is known as \"pedigree collapse\").   Still, for this many generations  the total is still so unavoidably large that on average, anyway, a modern Italian is descended from everyone in Caesar's Italy.  Which suggests that for most modern Italians, something like 1 in 8 of their ancestors at one point came the urbs.    BTW, one good example of an exception to the statistics is  Caesar himself.  His only known biological heir,  Caesarion, disappeared after Octavian defeated Cleopatra in 30 BC although an ancient rumor had it that he escaped to India with Cleopatra's treasure... ... In which case most of modern India is descended from Caesar.  On average. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends what do you mean with \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cRomans\u201d. Roman was the name given, during the first phase of the Roman expansion, to all the people who lived within the city limits. During the extension of the empire the name was extended to all those who lived in the empire itself. If with \u201cdescendants of the Romans\u201d you mean a mix of all the peoples who were part of the empire the answer is no. Italians are not the descendants of all the people inside the empire. At same times if you mean that we are only the \u201cdescendants of the Latins\u201d (the Italic tribes that founded Rome) the answer is still no but if you mean that we are the descendants of the Italics populations that lived in Italy with Latins and were genetically related to them yes, practically we are still the same of Roman times. We are mostly the descendants of the Italic tribes that lived Italy during the foundation of Rome and during the Empire.  Roman frescos in Pompeii and Rome that represents rich people of italiac ancestory :       After the collapse of Roman empire Italians were conquered by different people but the amount of mix was absolutely not enough for change the \u201cethnic background\u201d of Italic people except for 3 regions : Sicily/ Trentino-South Tyrol / Friuli. The last 2 regions are so near to Austrian and Slovenian border that they were considered non italics but Romans themselves. Sicily is different because it was considered Italic but they had strong connection with middle Eastern during the \u201cEmirate of Sicily\u201d, unlike most of the south that was under Lombards in that times (Principality of Benevento, Principality of Salerno, Principality of Capua, Duchy of Amalfi and Duchy of Naples) or Byzantine Empire (Greeks).  If you exclude these regions that are located on the opposite and most extreme sides of Italy all those who are in the middle are descendants of the Italian peoples who have always lived in Italy together with the Latins who founded Rome. The only really mix was with Greeks during the foundation and first expansion of Rome. You can see this even in Italian genetics : we are southern European. Population structure of modern-day Italians reveals patterns of ancient and archaic ancestries in Southern Europe Here some Romans that looked exactly like modern days italians :     You can see more in this answer : Federica Tavoletta's answer to Why do historical human statue in Rome looks more like Northern European than Rome Italian local people?

            "answer_text": "Are Italians descendants of the Romans? First of all, what do you mean by Romans? There were citizens of the Roman Empire that were not racially descended from Romans: they were Romans, but not descended from Romolus and Remus, so to speak. The very indigenous population of the Italian paeninsula was not racially Roman: I am referring, for instance, to the Etruscans, that were basically exterminated by the Romans, who were reputed not to be from the Italian Paeninsula. Famous Latin writers like Titus Livius, for instance, were not pure descendants of Romulus and Remus, so to speak: Titus Livius was probably of barbarian descent (probably of Venetic descent, a maybe celtic population, proficient with horse husbandry and metal crafting, expecially jewellery). That was by no means unusual: the Romans tended to assimilate and absorb other populations, and such was the prestige of their culture that in most cases everybody then wanted to be reputed only Roman, forgetting their own descent. In any case, Italy has been subjected of so many waves of migration since the Roman Empire, that it seems absurd to think about finding pure Roman (??? Whatever that means) blood in modern Italians. I would concede to finding traces of it in the Italian population in general\u2026but in any case, how would you recognise it, what actually would you define as Roman blood? Another point: different regions and even towns in Italy may have had different history of migrations, some were more secluded, some less. So, there may be more original blood in one place than in another\u2026but again if that original blood is of the type you are searching is very dubious. ",

            "answer_text": "One can\u2019t equate Italian=Roman. Rome, before the empire was a city state in south-central Italy whose people were ethnically part of the Latin speaking population that made up the region of Latium. They were part of the Italic tribes that lived in much of Italy and spoke related languages (like Umbrian). To the North were the Etruscans, a mysterious people who spoke a separate language. Beyond them were Celtic tribes as well as the Venetii. In the South of Italy were the Greek city states that made up \u201cMagna Graecia\u201d as the Romans called it. These where the first Greeks the Romans encountered, they used their tribal name, \u201cGraikoi\u201d to refer to all the Hellenes. It was also these Greeks that had a heavy influence on the cultures of Italy such as passing on their version of the alphabet rather than the one used in Athens which became the standard for Greek in the Hellenistic period. The Romans would later become the dominate power in Latium before conquering all of Italy and the islands near by. After that Rome began to expand outside of Italy and the Roman Empire would form. The Italian peninsula from about Naples (Neapolis at the time) north, along with Iberia, Gallia, Dacia and parts of the Balkans would be Latinized. Southern Italy largely remained Greek (and part of the Byzantine/(Eastern) Roman Empire for much of the middle ages\u2014the area would not be largely Italicized until after about 1500, and even today Greek speaking villages still exist. The people of Italy, like most Europeans are largely descended of the neolithic populations that lived in the peninsula. That being said if one is referring to specifically \u201cRoman\u201d (or more accurately Latin/Italic) ancestry among Italians today it would be mostly found among central Italians. Among the Southern Italians they show a close relationship to Greeks even today \u201cuna facia, una racia\u201d (it should also be noted that some of the neolithic DNA that entered into Greece thousands of years ago made its way to Southern Italy next, the two regions have always had \u201ctraffic\u201d between them up until the early Ottoman period. Northern Italians show decent from the Etruscans and beyond them show a background similar to that of the South-east French, Swiss, and Austrians. So to answer the questions Italians are largely descended of the people who lived in Italy during the Roman period but the people of the region around Rome today are the specific decedents of the ethnic Latin Romans.

The Roman republic first and the Roman empire later expanded into an already populated place, assimilating into its own citizenship anyone was there, who didn't change their blood just because somebody else was printing their passports. Between those people there whee some already organized civilizations (like the Greeks or the Etruscan) or the nomadic tribes who populated the north plane and the alps (mostly of Celt, Gaul or Goth origin). The Roman soldiers where not that much to overtake those entire populations, that continue to exist under the new order. And some of them also became Roman soldiers or Roman administrators. (so that not all Romans where \u2026 from Rome!) The west-Roman empire, then, ceased to exist at about 500 d.c. with the existing population ruling themselves or ruled by other bordering populations, like the Ostrogoth, the Francs (motly ex-Gauls) the Lombards (ex- Celt and Guals) the Bizantine (mostly ex-Greeks) and lots of others who succeeded across the centuries. Even the term Italian is not meaningful to define a descendant: it can mean a citizen of the Kingdom or Republic of Italy (from 1861 onward), with no meaning about his personal origin, and not exactly the same territory: who is in and who is out? Are people from Bolzano Italian? are they Roman? What about Trieste or Gorizia, or the Savoy, that\u2019s actually in France? What about he Swiss Ticino?) or \u201csomeone living in the Italian peninsula\u201d (Is northern Italy parto of it? Where does the \u201cpeninsula\u201d starts? Is the Massa-Senigallia line meaningful for that?) Romans certainly have descendants, but you cannot find them anymore in a well specific place: too many years and generations and intermixing with other people, some already there before them, some getting there after them.

            "answer_text": "Generally speaking, yes.  Italy has been invaded and settled in by many peoples since the fall of Rome, but on the whole the numbers of these newcomers were small compared to the population of Italy.  The Ostrogoths, for example, numbered only a few tens of thousands at most.  They formed a political and military elite that ruled over a population of millions, but made little impact on the ethnic make-up of the Italian peninsula.  The same goes for later invaders and colonists such as the Lombards and Normans. This means the vast majority of modern Italians are descendants of people who regarded themselves as Romans by the time of the end of the Empire.  But it also needs to be remembered that Rome in particular and Italy in general was a cultural and ethnic melting pot during the centuries of the Roman Empire.  Not only was it a magnet for people from all over Europe and the Mediterranean, but it also had a population of slaves that numbered in the millions.  And those slaves almost always came from outside Italy.  This means the \"Romans\" were a very mixed lot and by the end of the Empire most Romans in Italy had large numbers of Greeks, Celts, Spaniards, North Africans and Germanics in their family background. The we need to remember that those who regarded themselves as Romans in the Republic and early Empire and who had no non-Italian ancestry at all had once not regarded themselves as \"Roman\" at all.  Most Romans who came from somewhere in Italy other than Rome itself had Uscan, Etruscan, Sabine, Samnite or other non-Roman ancestry. So modern Italians are mainly descended from the \"Romans\", but the Romans themselves were a very mixed lot. ",

(lex Plautia Papiria) which extended Roman citizenship to all Italics under the river Po. The Lex Roscia, in 49 B.C., gave the Roman citizenship to Gallia Cisalpina denizens as well. Finally the Lex Antoniniana gave the status of Roman citizen to all the inhabitants of the Roman Empire. Besides, there were several way to acquire Roman citizenship, apart from the existing laws. One could become Roman citizen because one had served as a Roman \u201cpoliceman\u201d (Vigiles), because one had paid a hefty amount of money to build a home in Rome, because one had sold wheat to Rome, because one had been a miller in Rome for a certain number of years. A libertus (an enfranchised slave) became a Roman citizen, while a foreign woman who married a Roma citizen did not (but her children did, until Lex Minicia de liberis, which stated that all children with a foreign parent shoud be considered strangers). As almost everybody in Italy was actually a Roman citizen after 49 B.C. well, yes, I believe that at least a part of the present day Italian citizens actually descend from Romans. Of course, after the collapse of the Roman Empire, Italy was invaded several times and by several different peoples: Huns, Longobards, Goths, Frankishs, Normans, Spaniards, Moors. Each one of them left pinches of their ADN all over the place. Thus, you can find very Nordic-looking Italians and very Mediterranean-looking Italian (even in the same family), with all the possible shades in the middle. For example, here are three contemporary Italian actors. Silvio Muccino (nordic looking)  Raoul Bova (half and half)  Pierfrancesco Favino (mediterranean)  We are a mightily mixed people. And believe me, it is a very good thing. ",

            "answer_text": "A difficult question to answer. The original Romans ended up ruling territories in the Italian peninsula, the Mediterranean and Europe much vaster than their ability to populate them single handedly. Of course many populations of non Roman origin in Italy such as Sabines, Samnites, Etruscans, Greeks from the Magna Graecia, etc.,  ended up under Roman rule and somehow integrated into the Roman society. As Roman rule extended, many more peoples living within the boundaries of the Empire integrated linguistically and otherwise into the Roman way of life. The edict of Caracalla in 212 A.D. made all citizens living within the boundaries of the Empire citizens of Rome. Were they Romans? How many of the original uncontaminated Romans descending from Aeneas were left at the end of the Empire? Difficult question to answer. Yet if you travel around Italy today you cannot fail to trace in the inhabitants of local regions somatic traits and sometimes even behaviours and traditions that are reminiscent of the different peoples that settled the peninsula before the Romans and during and after the Empire: in Emila Romagna (Bologna) you have ample evidence of presence of Celts, in Tuscany of Etruscans, in Umbria of Osco-Umbrians, in Abruzzi of Sabines, in Campania of Samnites, in Lombardy of Longobards, present also in the Duchy of Benevento in the Campania region, in Sicily even of Arabs, Normans and Greeks, in Sardinia of Phoenicians originating from what is called Lebanon today, and, why not?, in Rome of Romans: you even see some of them dressed as gladiators standing by the Colosseum for the tourists to take pictures with. To conclude what is more important than the genetic aspect of the \"Roman\" question is the legacy which Rome left to posterity: its concepts of organized society, of the Law, of tolerance of assimilated cultures and religions (up to the moment when Christianity prevailed!), its keen interest in science and culture and, last but not least, its ability to shape a language that still survives in practically all European and American languages today in its alphabet and vocabulary. Even the language we are now using to communicate owes most of its vocabulary (48%) to the language of Rome.In this sense we can say that we are all \"Romans\" to a certain degree, ",

            "answer_text": "It depends which part of Italy you are talking about, as well as other factors such as historical migrations, imperial conquests, genetic compositions and population movements. Romans themselves were not a homogeneous group, as I don\u2019t think any group in the Mediterranean were, but themselves comprise a mixture of Latin & other local Italic or Indo-European tribes, and Etruscans. The Latins were simply one branch of the Italic tribes, who themselves descend from the ever-influential Indo-Europeans. Indo-European men tended to take foreign women as wives through their migration, so who knows what ancient neolithic or hunter-gatherer population they mixed with along the way. Central & North Italy would have the most amount of Roman genes, as this is where Roman civilization began, and mainly settled/colonised. It is unlikely that anyone in Italy descends from only one group of people. Culturally, the whole of Italy is mainly Italian with regional differences. Sicily & Calabria probably have the most prominent cultural differences. Central & Northern Italy have the most IE genes, specifically Italic & Germanic, as well as Etruscan, and other ancient neolithic migratory populations from the Middle East, and the Eurasian steppes. Southern Italians have a bit more of a complicated history in regards to this. It would depend entirely on the person\u2019s local region, and it\u2019s history. Southern Italy has historically been populated by many different ethno-linguistic groups, such as the Illyrians, Sardinians, Italics, Etruscans, Vandals, Normans, Greeks, Phoenicians, Berbers, Iberians, Ligures (ancient French), Arabs, Hebrews, etc. Some regions of Southern Italy have a long history of Greek or Albanian settlement, while others have a long history of Arab or Berber settlement. While I find history, and human genetics very interesting, I can only speak for myself on this matter. As a person who comes from Italy (Calabria), I had my DNA tested by AncestryDNA, and found out that 82% of my ancestry was from Italy. Now, the interesting thing is that under the \u2018regions of Italy\u2019 section, I had no connection to any region besides Sicily. What does this mean? Well, it means that it is highly unlikely I have any Roman or \u201cLatin\u201d ancestry. Native Sicilians just by themselves descend from 5 main groups. 1. The Sicels - a likely Italic, Ligurian or Illyrian (probably Italic) tribe, who gave the Island of Sicily it\u2019s name. 2. Elymians. - a non-IE people who originated from an Aegean island, who themselves descend from a number of typical MENA/European neolithic populations. 3. The Sicanians, a native neolithic people from Iberia, specifically Valencia, who immigrated to Sicily since ancient times, one of the oldest inhabitants of the land, and the oldest recorded inhabitants of the land. 4. South-Western European hunter-gatherer nomads, originally from the Caucasus & Eurasian steppes. 5. Ancient Neolithic populations from the Middle East, North Africa & Eurasia. Hope this answered your question. :-) Here is the remarkable Elymian temple at Segesta, dated around the 500s bc.  ",

            "answer_text": "Not really, because Italy has some of the widest genetics in Europe. Yet, because of the history of this empire has its burst center right in Italy, where the empire expanded and grew, it was widely argued that, are Italians truly the descendants of the Romans. In that case, we can say both yes and no. Yes: Italy was the center, and the most centralized part of the Roman nation. Italian culture in modern era has many resemblance to the ancient Roman culture. The previous Italian military dictatorships sought to use the Roman heritage to do so. The center of Roman Empire is today\u2019s capital of Italy, the oldest existing capital of an empire.No: Italians are too wide and too decent, due to immigration and ethnic assimilation. Almost every Romans were gone, or assimilated. Roman Empire had expanded across Europe so almost every European nations can claim they are descendants of Romans. Italians today do not speak Latin language, but just a variety of it.You can argue the possibility that Italians are true descendants of the Romans. You can argue the other. Overall, since the Roman Empire\u2019s strongest and most powerful centre is in Italy today, and even when Italy was reunited at 1860s, the Savoys proclaimed Rome as capital, this is very likely that the Italians are somehow closely related, perhaps closest, among the ancient Romans. Yet that doesn\u2019t mean they are completely children of the Romans due to the spread of Renaissance and the later influence from the Germans and Slavs, which tend to absorb many aspects in Italian society today.

            "answer_text": "It makes little sense asking what the Romans were, genetically. And there isn\u2019t even need to call the Empire or Barbarian invasions which came later. Rome was always a melting pot, Rome of the beginning was politically and economically more an Etruscan city than anything else, a population which puzzled everybody at the time as much they do now, so the strangest hypothesis were made, even if today it\u2019s thought they were simply autochthonous. So you could find there a good many \u201cupper class\u201d Etruscans, nobles, merchants and a large Latin workforce, shepards, peasants, and of course they mixed. Also, the Etruscans as a whole should have been a larger population than the others in the area, they had been much richer and evolved for much longer time. You add all others center \u201cItalic\u201d ethnicities they came in contact very soon with, all kind of peoples in the north, Celts, Rethians not to speak of Greeks in the south (which were far from being \u201cpure blood\u201d in their own right). Troian origins and myths were invented later, when they learned the existence of such things from the Greeks, to support the organisation of the state, probably, it\u2019s some greeks that invented it at the beginning. So nobody knew what the ethnic Romans were from day one, Rome was a political concept. Rome is Law, boldly engraved in the stone, Roman is what the Roman Law says is Roman, no tricks, no double meanings. And after endless centuries, the \u201cbyzantine\u201d (a name which never existed) armies, a pool of everybody which would take pages to list, still marched high and proud under the SPQR banner and called themselves Romans. And yes, in Italy you can probably find some genetic markers of what are supposed to be ancient Etruscans and Latins more than in other places, but playing with insignificant genetic markers makes no sense.

            "answer_text": "Only to some extent. Italians are the final product of centuries of invasions, and they can be genetically very different. Romans were in fact the inhabitants of Rome and the region around it, today's Lazio region, and as they expanded into the rest of the italian peninsula they conquered and/or absorbed several other populations, like Etruscans in Tuscany and Greeks in southern Italy, an area previously known as \u201cMagna Grecia\u201d (Great Greece) and Venetians in the Italian North-east: these previously inhabited (1500\u20131100 b.C.) a region between today's Germany and Poland. North-western Italy was originally inhabited by Celtic populations and so were the big islands Sardegna and Corsica. Later on to northwestern Italy came a people from a western Germany region around Elbe river. They were called Longobards, and mainly settled in today's Lombardy. Also Goths, another people from eastern Germany, settled and left their traces in northern Italy. There was a brief occupation of Sicily on parts of Arabs, but their discriminating policies didn't allow a mix-up with locals, except some muslims who married local women - the opposite being not allowed. They were defeated - and the survivors deported back to Africa - when Normans arrived there from Northern Europe. You can still meet blue-eyed blond-haired people in Sicily, who are descendants of Normans. There have been more foreign dominations/occupations on part of Austria, France and Spain and chances are that their DNA mixed to some extent to that of locals... So Italians are only culturally and linguistically the descendants of ancient Romans, their genetic heritage is a multinational mixture. ",

So although Rome would have been invaded by outsiders, as well as having foreign people living in rome for many years, I guess that it is statistically possible that someone living in Rome today might well be the direct descendent of a Latin speaking Roman citizen . And of course, many ' Roman citizens' were people like St Paul - folks who lived far from Rome, were not racially linked to the latin people who founded the city and who were *legally* considered Roman citizens when it came to their rights.  If you want to consider St Paul, and people like him,  as ' ancient Romans' , the chances are increased of finding an \" ancient roman 2 among your ancestry, even if you lived in New York ! ",

            "answer_text": "As Steve Theodore explained Italy can not be equated with Rome. If you take Romans to mean citizens of Rome/Latium then only a small amount of the genetic heritage of modern day Italians will be \"Roman\". If, however, you are asking whether modern day Italians are descended from the population that lived in Italy during Roman times the answer is: most probably and in most cases yes. I don't have enough knowledge about Northern and Central Italy. There have been a few studies about the Etruscan descent of areas in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna but the jury is still out mainly because there isn't a reference sample to compare modern Italians to. Maybe archaeogenetics will tell us in time.  On the other hand the continuity of the population in Southern Italy and Sicily is proven by their close genetic relationship with modern day Greeks that is evident in all genetic studies. As a friend from Naples said \"Misma faccia, misma razza\" or \"Una faccia, una razza\" as we say in Greece. The common ancestors were Greek settlers who lived before the Romans and the population exchange between Greece and Italy virtually ceased after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. So it is safe to presume that the similarity, one might say identity, is the result of both populations descent from the respective ancient populations.

I mean, yes, for sure and definetley italians are the descendents of ancient romans, we don't simply live by chance in the same place. But is true as well that Italians are not ONLY the descendants of ancient romans, we have many other ancestors (whose part may be smaller or bigger, usually by far smaller than the romans, but not always). However, we don't fall in the trap  italy has been conquered so the population has been replaced everytime.. most common people remained the same, only the holigarchy changed. the \"Romans\" to begin with is a concept that changes a lot during the time. Now, even if we don't consider the roman citizenship (that has been for long time something different from being a real roman, it had for centuries great importance wheather you were from italy or from a province), we see that in different times romans were a small tribe that little by little conquered all the italic peninsula. Etrurians were not considered romans in the begin, but were surely romans later...  ",

            "answer_text": "Romans were those who were citizen of Rome and later of its Empire. That had nothing to do with origin or even race, a concept that was unknown to Romans who looked at a person as Roman only when he was a Citizen, regardless of any other consideration. One could be or become a citizen by birth, adoption or concession. So, while Gaius Julius Caesar was \"undusputably\" from a patrician family that traced its noble origin to Troy, via Iulo and Aeneas, and even to Venus, who had had a fling with Aeneas, Caesar was as Roman as any other citizen born in Northern Africa, Illyria, Gaul or Syria of families of African, Illyrian, Gallic or Syrian stock and even as any Libertus, a freed slave that had been made a citizen (remember Ben Hur after he saves the Roman Admiral?) The gloomy concept if Race did evolve as a consequence of the fall of the Western Roman Empire, when the victors - the barbarian of yesteryears, those who would plunge Europe into the dark ages - had only their origin to oppose to the cultural splendors of those they had subjugated militarily but could not even conceive to equal on any other level, so, to distinguish themselves, preserve and maintain their status of military victors and novel, if crassly incompetent rulers, they only had Race, Provenance and Origin to rely upon. From this complex and quite inelegant background, all the future nationalities of the whole of the Mediterranean basin were formed, and successively modified and reshaped generally thanks to the sword, with the result that no one today can rightfully claim being The True Descendant of Rome more or less than another, even those able to show - assuming that were at all feasible and possible - a direct DNA link with Cicero, Sulla and Terentius. It is also truth that we Italian use today a language that is the natural evolution of Latin, but Latin was not an exclusive preserve of Rome or of the Italian peninsula, rather, it was the scholarly, political, military and administrative language of the whole empire that spanned from Portugal to Azerbaijan and from the Adrian Wall to Egypt. The flip-side of the coin is that a great many can today claim being the descendants of Rome and rightful co-heirs to her grandeur. They are the ones who, today still benefit from the Roman Laws embedded in the legal systems of their countries; those who, still today, walk on Roman roads, on Roman Bridges, admire daily Roman architecture, and in general benefit from Roman culture. In this light, yes, Italians are the descendants of ancient Roman, as are the French, the Croatian and the Spaniard as well as many others. ",

Italy is made up of four main ethnic groups (north, centre, south and Sardinia, for want of better names) that have no special relationship to each other. The north and the centre are two separate things but quite close to each other and part of the northern/central European continuum. Sardinia is a world apart with respect to any European ethnic group. The south is a thing apart in the sense that the genetic distance between the centre/north and the south is far larger than the distance between the centre/north and any central European country. These four ethnic groups are (like any other ethnic group in Europe and elsewhere) the result of the mixing of a number of components but they are no more mixed than other European ethnic groups. Quite the contrary, indeed! Italy (in the sense of its separate ethnic groups) turned out to be one of the less mixed group of Europe. And, for those who refer to post Roman (alledged) invasions: the Norman contribution outside Palermo was close to zero and there were very few Austrians or French or Spaniards who moved to the various pre \u201cunity\u201d states of Italy. You should rather talk about Celts, Ligurians, Veneti, Reti, Villanoviani, Umbri, Piceni and so on \u2026 ",

If you\u2019re referring to the people who originated from central Italy and Latium, I would say that at this point in time it would be impossible to answer unfortunately. How would anyone be able to trace his/her ancestry back to the original peoples of central Italy when it was tribal about 2500 years ago. Furthermore, a Roman almost 2000 years ago could have been anyone who lived anywhere from Britain to the Middle East. Just as people move to different places now, people from all over the empire came to Italy, and vice versa. Roman citizens and other Italians would have migrated to other parts of the empire like Spain, Gaul, or Britain. Also many slaves were brought into Italy. I\u2019d say the honest answer would be that if you are of Italian descent you would have a decent chance of having at least some ancestors who were Roman citizens or who were the original peoples of central Italy, especially if your family has deep roots in Rome or central Italy.

            "answer_text": "People living actually in the Italian peninsula (and not being recent immigrants) have a quite mixed ancestry. In the bronze-age different cultures were preexisting in Italy. Since the 7th Century BC and on, the southern part and Sicily were massively colonized by Greeks. These ones were displaces (as many other tribes) by Latins, a tribe populating an area where one town called Rome prevailed over their tribal neighbors, and over all other tribes of the peninsula. As barbarian tribes started getting citizenship from 1st Century BC on, ethnical mixture became more common. Since the 4th Century AD more and more often, germanic peoples from the north entered the Italian peninsula. By the 6th Century AD the germanic kingdom of the Lombards was fully established in the area. During the late middle age and early Renaissance the region, particularly the north, got great contact with French, Spanish and German populations during the Italian wars. So today Italian population may have some early Roman ascendancy, but the ethnic mixing is quite big. ",

It is inevitable that italians have a part of roman genes in them, but they also probably have wisigoth genes, greek genes, gallic genes, and so on. So genetically speaking, this question makes little sense. Culturally speaking, the italians are from the romance peoples and so are in a way the descendants of the Romans. Again, it is arguable that there was also other significant influences on their culture, or that all the romance peoples are the descendants of the romans because of that, but the italian culture has been subject to 2 waves of roman influence. The first one was obviously the Republic/Empire, an influence which is shared by all romance peoples. The second one is the Renaissance, sparked by the fall of Constantinople in 1453 and the return of old knowledge, artists and the likes to Italy, the Eastern Roman Empire being no more. Other nearby romance peoples such as France also felt that 2nd wave, but Italy was directly impacted, while France was impacted by the Italian Renaissance. So, in terms of culture, yes, one could argue that the italians are the descendants of the Romans. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but\u2026. Yes, because as of 90 B.C. all free men in Italy were Roman citizens by law, and under the Empire later that status became more important than any other identity. It was difficult if not impossible for any non-citizen to live in Italy unless as a slave or visiting nobility. But in the later empire \u201cbarbarian\u201d tribes were allowed to migrate in, first in Germania and Gaul but later into Italy itself, without them necessarily becoming Romans. So once the empire broke down in the west, everyone in Italy was either Roman or Romanized, and by the time the barbarian incursions had ended and the Frankish kingdom established, everyone in Italy had Roman ancestors because the tribes who had come in intermarried with the Romans. Thus today\u2019s Italians are descendants of the Romans, but not just of the Romans; there is Goth and Hun and other blood mixed in. Though it\u2019s worth noting that Italy is not unique in this; the same is mostly true of France and of Spain as well, and for that matter of Greece, since by the time Rome had been sacked several times and no longer ruled in the west, everyone in Greece had become a Roman citizen as well.

Anyways is worth reminding that Italy was inhabitated by different peoples that were conquered and assimilated into the Latin culture, so this is the reason of differences among North, Central and South Italy in terms of DNA. If you talking about the culture, our language (or languages, if we take into consideration also the local ones) and culture are the product of the evolution of the Latin culture. ",

But you have to know that 40% of the population were slaves from all over the empire. Than the \u201cGreat migration\u201d happened and gothic and germanic tribes setteled the area. We don\u2019t want to talk about the Slavic people in north Italy. There are 150 thousand of them. Than there is large population of Germans in South Tyrol. The Normans were overlords over large part of South Italy. Than the muslims came and populated Sicily with people from Africa and Middle east. So if you want to claim that Italians are direct decendants of the ancient Romans you are wrong because at this point(even with Romanian immigrants and other people) you can claim that people from all over the empire are direct decendants of the Romans. Here you go from the historical point of view. ",

I am 50 percent northern Italian, 48 percent German/French and 20 percent Austrian, Serbian and Hungarian. I am sure contemporary Romans would also find a lot of diversity. Ancient Romans, I imagine, would also show genetic diversity. An expert in genetics could answer this question more accurately.

Roman citizenship was not conferred by blood, but as a privilege to those who lived acording to Roman culture. In the I century b.C. all the people from Italy became citizens and, 300 years later, this right was universally granted to every free person living in the Empire, including people from Lybia and North Africa. Posterior migrants (Goths, Lombards, etc) mixed with the Roman population of Italy and so it is highly unlikely that a modern Italian doesn\u2019t have at least one Roman ancestor. The exception are migrants that came from lands outside the former Roman Empire (Eastern Europe, Far East, Americas and sub Saharan Africa). ",

It is sure that Italians descend from ancient Italic populations, but we can\u2019t verify if Italians have, Lombards, Normans etc. It is also impossible to confirm with a genetic precision if someone descends from a specific Italic population. Genetic results give an approximate percentage of Italian origins. I was born and raised in the Province of Rome and my parents, grandparents and great-grandparents were born in the same Province, so I identify myself with Rome. However I don\u2019t have a Mediterranean look, I\u2019m Nordic some Italians thought I was from Northern Italy and in fact I live here, but I come from Lazio. My hair are light brown, my complexion is fair and my eyes are green brown. A lot of people told me that I look German and when I was a child, my hair were light blonde. At the same time people were surprised to notice that my eyes were brown and my mother told me that I was a rarity because most blonde people have fair eyes. So I also think to have a Germanic or Eastern European ancestry. My grandmother\u2019s name was Lutgarda and it is a Germanic name, soon after I discovered that her town near Rome was visited by many German, Austrian, French and Danish portrait painters. Who knows what happened after the fall of the Roman Empire ? ",

From the first, Etruscans intermarried with the Romans, and diluted the gene pool with Middle Eastern and Celtic DNA. The Romans, seeing inbreeding as a source of weakness and seeking to expand their numbers, took Sabines and others as their wives. The struggle for privilege and social supremacy worked in the opposite direction, with Romans struggling to keep Greeks, the closest large and fitted DNA group, from taking over through various biases and \u201cchauvinist\u201d laws. Greeks were not allowed to wear a toga, call themselves Roman, etc. So, you might find Italians saying they are Roman, and with good cause (I discovered that my paternal y DNA was identical with that found in a village outside of Bologna 1300 years, ago), but in general Italians are a mixture of Italic, Greek, Celtic, Germanic (Gothic-Swedish), Spanish (Iberian-Western Mediterranean), and other similar types.
