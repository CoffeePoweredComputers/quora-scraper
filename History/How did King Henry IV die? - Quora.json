            "answer_text": "At the age of 41 King Henry IV was experiencing several ailments. And, the king's health steadily deteriorated, he contracted a form of skin disease, variously considered to be leprosy, syphilis or psoriasis. He is said to have developed a large tumor under his nose, while his body was covered in suppurating sores. The maladies he suffered from have been the subject of a wide range of theories which it is impossible to confirm, they range from epilepsy to a form of cardiovascular disease. His death was sudden and unexpected. The cause of his death has been attributed to, amongst other things, pneumonia, typhoid, and appendicitis. He suffered a seizure whilst praying at St. Edward's shrine at Westminster and was carried to the to the abbot's house. The first King of the House of Lancaster died on 20th of March 1413, in the Jerusalem chamber at Westminster. During his lifetime it had been predicted that Henry would die in Jerusalem. The king himself took this to mean that he would die on Crusade. He was not buried at Westminster, the traditional mausoleum of English kings, but at Canterbury Cathedral, in the Trinity Chapel, near to the shrine of Thomas A' Becket and opposite the tomb of the Black Prince. During Henry's reign, the cult of St. Thomas Becket was extremely popular and Henry was particularly devoted to Becket. His widow, Joan of Brittany, had an altar tomb built over the spot.   ",

Henry IV - National Portrait Gallery Henry was the first King of England since the Conquest whose mother tongue was English. Known as Henry Bolingbroke before he became king, he was the son of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. Henry seized the throne in 1399 after overthrowing and imprisoning Richard II.
