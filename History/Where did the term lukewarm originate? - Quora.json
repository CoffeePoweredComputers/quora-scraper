            "answer_text": "This term dates back to prehistoric cave men days when \u201cmen\u201d ruled with clubs and dragged their cave women by the feet into their caves when they misbehaved or did not follow orders. Yes, this is how this whole thing started out. One day, the caveman asked his rather hairy and disheveled cave companion for a hot tub and a scrub. While she stoked the flames and pour the water into the porcelain tub back then, he watched his favorite episodes of the Flintstones on the bedrock channel. After watching about an hours worth of his favorite TV show he jumped into the tub and with a deafening scream yelled at her - \u201cLook Worm\u201d this water is not hot! . He clubbed her that night and each and every night for about 50,000 years until another woman, Ida R. Forbes mercifully invented the hot water heater in 1917. Ms. Forbes received her hot water heater patent on December 25, 1917. Talk about necessity being the mother of invention. It was the best Christmas gift that that lumpy head cave woman had ever received. So for the sake of adding two new words into the Webster\u2019s Dictionary, they replaced \u201cLook Worm\u201d with \u201cLukewarm\u201d in March, 1959. Everybody has lived happily ever after since. Don\u2019t believe me, look it up yourself in the internet Ida R. Forbes, inventor of the hot water heater, finally stops the clubbing! ",

            "answer_text": "It turns out, while today using \u201cluke\u201d to mean \u201cwarm\u201d has gone out of fashion, possibly due to the popularity of the name \u201cLuke\u201d, at one time that\u2019s what the word meant. This came from the fact that \u201cluke\u201d derived from \u201clew\u201d or \u201clewk\u201d or \u201cleuk\u201d, in Middle English, which meant \u201ctepid\u201d (slightly warm). This in turn came from the Old English adverb \u201chl\u0113owe\u201d, which means \u201cwarm or sunny\u201d. Finally, \u201chl\u0113owe\u201d came from the Proto-Germanic *hl\u0113waz, meaning \u201cwarm\u201d. The word \u201clukewarm\u201d popped up around the 14th century as meaning \u201cslightly warm\u201d. Within two centuries, it also began having a figurative meaning, that of \u201clacking in enthusiasm\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Where did the term lukewarm originate? The English adjective lukewarm, \"neither cold nor hot, tepid,\" late 14c., is a combination of warm (adj.) + luke (adj.) \"tepid\" (c. 1200). It is a word of unknown origin. Perhaps it is from Middle Dutch or Old Frisian leuk \"tepid, weak,\" or an unexplained variant of Old English hleowe (adv.) \"warm,\" all of which are from Proto-Germanic *khlewaz (from PIE root *kele- (1) \"warm;\" compare lee). The figurative sense of \"lacking in zeal, not ardent\" (of persons or their actions) is from 1520s. Related: Lukewarmly; lukewarmness. Luke-warmth (1590s) is marked \"rare\" in OED. ",
