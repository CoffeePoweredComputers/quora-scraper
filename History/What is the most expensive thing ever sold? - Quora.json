ONCE YOU HAVE MESSED WITH IT THEN ONLY YOU WILL COME TO KNOW THAT THIS STATEMENT IS NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH !! Mostly people don\u2019t realise it\u2019s importance before they themselves have experienced feeling bad like hell!! Once reached a messed up state of health,they put in every sort of efforts to bring their body back to the optimal state of functioning. These may be : 1)MONETARY efforts- like their own income,savings,health-insurance,aid from friends and family, and even loans and donations,etc) 2)PHYSICAL efforts- like exercising,ceasing to be lazy,moulding their habits and lifestyle for the same,etc) And not to forget travelling the world for finding the best doctor and begging and pleading to doctor and god simultaneously, I.e.not taking any kind of chance!! The price of even a single organ transplant(includes medicines,Pre and post-operative care and sometimes nurses too) is quite big. That too when you are lucky enough to find a donor and everything falls into the right place. Now,imagine if you\u2019ve messed up with multiple organs. Infact, it becomes exponentially expensive with regard to the damage done to it. Even after all restoration processes,mostly it isn\u2019t the same feeling as that of a healthy body. Infact money starts to lose all it's value when you can\u2019t get back the same state of health by all the money in the world. DON\u2019T BELIEVE ME,ASK ANY BILLIONAIRE!! ",
