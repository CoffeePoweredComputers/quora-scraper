Contemporary Egypt, is mostly an ethnic admixture between foreign invaders, conquerors and indigenous African people. Autosomally, as a whole, they tend to cluster more with Eurasian especially the Middle East. In the south, populations like Nubians cluster more with Africans (and thus Ancient Egyptians). All this is because of massive immigration from Europe and western Asia which started in the Late New Period. Well after Egypt was ancient. The Hyksos (Aamu) foreign rule during the second intermediate period, as well as during the late periods up to now (Assyrians, Greek, Roman, Arab conquest, British colonization, etc).This is all common knowledge, but it doesn't change the fact that the genisis of Egypt was African. Unlike the later Greco-Romans and later peoples,the foreigners who settled in Ancient Egypt did not change the fundamental character of the culture and society, they adopted it. Neither did they come in sufficient numbers to change the physical characteristics of the people fundamentally. For the most part, they settled in the Delta. If you had ever been to Egypt, you would know that the Delta is not part of the Nile Valley. The ancient Egyptians were not Near Eastern people. If you\u2019re referring to the time preceding the Ptolemaic Period, I\u2019m sure most of those mummies would test as European, Near Eastern. If you\u2019re referring to any time period prior the 26th Dynasty, you couldn\u2019t be more wrong. Many of today\u2019s Egyptians are not necessarily representative of Ancients due to outside migration and admixture from European/Arab sources, particularly in Lower Egypt. Some Coptic claims to be pharanoic descendants not supported by DNA studies or cultural history showing heavy Arabization since 900 AD. Copts are culturally assimilated immigrants (Christian).  Modern Egyptians a mixed population with European and Arab strands-not identical to ancients. Quote(s): \u201cClassical genetic studies show a high degree of genetic heterogeneity in the modern Egyptian population, suggesting that this population is descended from a mixture of African, Asian, and Arabian stock (Mahmoud et al. 1987; Hafez et al. 1986).

Y-chromosome analysis in Egypt, Hum Biology, 74:5, 645-658. Research paper: Y-chromosome analysis in Egypt suggests a genetic regional continuity in Northeastern Africa. New DNA data suggests that many modern Egyptians are not identical to the ancient Egyptians. While there is some linkage among SOME of today's Egyptians, particularly in the tropical south, (from whence the Dynasties sprung), new data indicates that many Egyptians today are Arabized/Eurasian types or hybrids. This is not necessarily a new finding. Bone studies show that the very late periodEgyptians (600-350BC) have datasets that are not \"typically\" Egyptians, like the earlier tropical African types before. Still, especially in the south, the tropical African influence still shows. Note this is not an \"either/or\" situation- but a matter of degree. MOST modern Egyptians seem Arabized/Eurasian but the DNA data still shows about one-third African, even with the Arabized takeover of Egypt.

These results therefore do not support the Petrie concept of a \\Dynastic race\" (Petrie, 1939; Derry, 1956). Instead, the results suggest that the Egyptian state was not the product of mass movement of populations into the Egyptian Nile region, but rather that it was the result of primarily indigenous development combined with prolonged small-scale migration, potentially from trade, military, or other contacts\u201d.

Saharan-Sudanic inheritance of Nile Valley settlers. Data on the peopling of the Nile Valley do not appear to support earlier historical notions of an initial wave of Caucasoid invaders entering from the North in order to introduce civilization. Mainstream data shows gradual movement and peopling from the south- the Saharan zone and associated parts of the Sudanic region, fusing with indigenous Nilotic elements already in place, leading into the development of the well-known Egyptian kingdoms, not sweeping insertions from the Mediterranean, Mesopotamia or elsewhere.(AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY 83:35-48 (1990). See Wiki article Predynastic Egypt for the now discounted Dynastic Race Theory. As to the Saharan movement even Afrocentric critics such as Mary Lefkowitz note: Quote(s): \"Recent work on skeletons and DNA suggests that the people who settled in the Nile valley, like all of humankind, came from somewhere south of the Sahara; they were not (as some nineteenth-century scholars had supposed) invaders from the North.

She found that the earlier samples were relatively more homogeneous in comparison to the later groups. However, overall results indicated genetic continuity over the Egyptian Predynastic and Early Dynastic periods, albeit with a high level of genetic diversity within the population, suggesting an indigenous process of state formation. She also concluded that while the biological patterning of the Egyptian population varied across time, no consistent temporal or spatial trends are apparent.

In studies based on anatomical traits and measurements of crania, similarities have been found between Nile Valley crania from 30,000, 20,000 and 12,000 years ago and various African remains from more recent times (see Thoma 1984; Brauer and Rimbach 1990; Angel and Kelley 1986; Keita 1993). Studies of crania from southern predynastic Egypt, from the formative period (4000-3100 B.C.), show them usually to be more similar to the crania of ancient Nubians, Kushites, Saharans, or modern groups from the Horn of Africa than to those of dynastic northern Egyptians or ancient or modern Southern Europeans\u201d.

Source: (Barry Kemp. (2006) Ancient Egypt: Anatomy of a Civilization. p. 54)\u201d. \u201cOver the long run of northeastern African history, what emerges most strongly is the extent to which ancient Egypt's culture grew from sub-Saharan African roots. The earliest foundations of the culture that was to evolve into that of dynastic Egypt were laid, as we have already discovered, by Afrasan immigrants from the general direction of the southern Red Sea hills, who arrived probably well before 10,000 B.C.E. The new inhabitants brought with them a language directly ancestral to ancient Egyptian. They introduced to Egypt the idea of using wild grasses or grains as food. They also introduced a new religion Its central belief, in the efficacy of clan deities, explains the traceability of the ancient Egyptian gods to different particular Egyptians localities: originally they were the deities of the local communities, whose members in still earlier times had belonged to a clan or a group of related clans\u201d.

Today however, essentially autochthonous explanations are preferred based on what we call the substratum theory, whereby all the civilizations in question, even in their differences and peculiarities share a common cultural substratum as occurs in the northern world among Indo-European civilizations\u201d. Source: CERVELL\u00d3 AUTUORI, Joseph, Egypt, Africa and the Ancient World. \u201cThe predominant craniometric pattern in the Abydos royal tombs is 'southern' (tropical African variant), and this is consistent with what would be expected based on the literature and other results (Keita, 1990). This pattern is seen in both group and unknown analyses... Archaeology and history seem to provide the most parsimonious explanation for the variation in the royal tombs at Abydos.. Tomb design suggests the presence of northerners in the south in late Nakada times (Hoffman, 1988) when the unification probably took place. Delta names are attached to some of the tombs at Abydos (Gardiner, 1961; Yurco, 1990, personal communication), thus perhaps supporting Petrie's (1939) and Gardiner's contention that north-south marriages were undertaken to legitimize the hegemony of the south. The courtiers of northern elites would have accompanied them\u201d. \u201cGiven all of the above, it is probably not possible to view the Abydos royal tomb sample as representative of the general southern Upper Egyptian population of the time. Southern elites and/or their descendants eventually came to be buried in the north (Hoffman, 1988). Hence early Second Dynasty kings and Djoser (Dynasty 111) (Hayes, 1953) and his descendants are not buried in Abydos. Petrie (1939) states that the Third Dynasty, buried in the north, was of Sudanese origin, but southern Egypt is equally likely. This perhaps explains Harris and Weeks' (1973) suggested findings of southern morphologies in some Old Kingdom Giza remains, also verified in portraiture (Drake, 1987). Further study would be required to ascertain trends in the general population of both regions. The strong Sudanese affinity noted in the unknown analyses may reflect the Nubian interactions with upper Egypt in predynastic times prior to Egyptian unification (Williams, 1980,1986)...\u201d Source: (S.

The question is answered right on the walls of and numerous monuments and ubiquitous artefacts found in the well preserved great pyramids. The people who built the pyramids and other collosal land marks knew that one day their history and heritage will be \u201cstolen\u201d that was why they built such enduring monuments and used hieroglyphs and pictures depicting both everyday life and sacred rituals and rites even though they had alphabetical writing. The \u201coriginal\u201d Egyptians were black. But please note that Egypt at its height was much much larger than what you see today which was cut haphazardly by the Europeans when they carved up Africa amongst themselves. It stretched down south all the way into parts of east and central Africa, with tributes coming from all these places making it very rich. To really talk about Egypt you would need to be specific with regards to the time or period as Egypt changed hands since it was conquered by Alexander the great (after who the ancient city of Alexandria is named ). It was the greatest kingdom in the world and also the center of learning of technology, arts and science. People from all over the world came to learn in its sacred places which at some point was off limits for europeans until the \u201choly pharaoh\u201d allowed them in freely and reduced egypts army as he hated war. There are many ancient accounts that detail the physical descriptions of the teachers and inhabitants of Thebes (wesat in ancient egyptian) and the were black. The longest river in Africa is the Nile with its delta situated in Egypt so its only natural that they lived and bred with other black kingdoms like Ethiopia and what European scholars call Nubian kindoms. Please do not get me wrong, at some point in its history there were many races living and trading in Egypt as it was also a commercial powerhouse. Its position between 2 continents and the natural connectivity provided by the great Nile meant that people and commerce was natural. its current inhabitants conquered it in AD 641 and continue to hold it. Today Africa has many races, black, white, Arab and many versions brought about by long term inter breeding like Berbers.
