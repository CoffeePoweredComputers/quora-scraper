            "answer_text": "Scholars disagree about whether or not King Solomon actually existed. There are many who support the view that he did, but there are a least a few who support the view that he probably did not. Many more take the position that we cannot know whether or not he existed. In my view, it is highly probable that King Solomon was a real historical figure, at least in the nominal sense, but I agree that we obviously cannot know for certain because, unfortunately, we have very few records from the time when he is supposed to have ruled. The account of Solomon\u2019s life found in the books of 2 Samuel and 1 Kings is part of the Deuteronomistic History, which comprises the books of Joshua, Judges, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, and 2 Kings. These books were all originally one work, but were incrementally divided into smaller sections. The Deuteronomistic History is believed by most scholars to have been originally composed during the reign of King Josiah of Judah (ruled c. 640\u2013609) and to have been revised later during the Babylonian Exile (c. 597\u2013539 BC). That means it was originally written roughly 300 years after Solomon is supposed to have ruled. We know from archaeological inscriptions that the later kings of Judah described in the Deuteronomistic History were definitely real rulers. There is no doubt, for instance, that the Omrides really existed and that they really ruled the small, Iron Age kingdom of Judah. We also know from the Tel Dan Stele that these kings claimed to be descended from a founder named David. Contrary to what apologists will tell you, the Tel Dan Stele does not prove that David himself existed, but it does prove that kings of Judah claimed to be descended from someone called \u201cDavid.\u201d That is a strong indication in favor of David\u2019s historical existence, but it does not necessarily prove anything. Many kings in the ancient world claimed to be descended from legendary figures.  If Solomon was a historical figure, he could not have possibly been nearly as wealthy, powerful, or influential as he is described in the Hebrew Bible and would have certainly been more of a minor regional chieftain. The archaeological record makes it painfully clear that, during the time when Solomon is said to have ruled, Judah was a tiny, insignificant kingdom and Jerusalem just one of many small villages. Most scholars generally agree that the Deuteronomistic History greatly exaggerates the glory of David and Solomon and inaccurately portrays them as monolatrists to serve a contemporary propagandistic purpose. The Deuteronomistic History, you see, is basically a huge propaganda piece for Josiah, the reigning monarch at the time when it was originally written, who was an ardent supporter of the small faction of Judahites calling for the worship of Yahweh alone. Even if Solomon did exist as a historical king of Judah in the tenth century BC, the Solomon we know from the Hebrew Bible is not the Solomon of history, but rather the Solomon of later imagination. That does not mean that the story of Solomon is without meaning, though, or that we should discard it as worthless. The idea of a lost golden age when rulers were ideally wise and just is an idea that still appeals to us to this very day and represents what we all look for in our own leaders. I do not know how effective the Biblical Solomon would be if he were president of the United States (no doubt far more effective than the man who is president right now), but the sense of longing for a wise and just ruler is still the same as it was 2,600 years ago.  For more information on this subject, a great book that I highly recommend is The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology\u2019s New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts by Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman. The authors are both reputable and widely-published scholars and the book does an excellent job of summarizing the mainstream view of the history of the Hebrew Bible for a lay audience. ",

            "answer_text": "There almost certainly was a King David, so it is possible that his successor was Solomon. According to the Bible, King Solomon was the son of David. If he did exist, almost everything we are told about King Solomon is fictional. He would have been little more than a tribal warlord, with limited power over a small region around Jerusalem, rather than a hereditary king and ruler of a great empire stretching north through Israel and even into Galilee and Syria. When a large and elaborate structure was discovered by archaeologists in the northern Israel city of Megiddo, they immediately assumed it to contain the stables of Solomon, even going as far as to date other important sites across the Ancient Near East based on the biblical date of the stables. Recent scholarship has recognised that the structure was actually a warehouse and that it appears to date from the time of King Omri. As more evidence comes to light, it is now apparent that Judah was too small and poor in the tenth century BCE to have dominated the larger and more prosperous northern region of Israel, and certainly not to have invaded large areas to the north. An important consensus now is that there was no United Monarchy of Judah and Israel. The defining legend of Solomon was his great wisdom, gifted to him by God. If there ever was a King Solomon, the Bible says that he was the wisest of kings. So, although not actually a wise ruler on the biblical evidence, he was a wise ruler in tradition. To support this tradition, the Books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes and even some Psalms were eventually attributed to King Solomon, although scholars can readily prove that they were actually compiled after the Babylonian Exile. Lester L. Grabbe says, in Ancient Israel: What Do We Know and How Do We Know It? that he does not discount the existence of King Solomon: \u201cHis name echoing the old god of Jerusalem (Shalim/Shalem) is suggestive of reality rather than simply the piety of the David story.\u201d He goes on, to say that the episode about Solomon and the Queen of Sheba was invented by the post-Deuteronomic redactor.
