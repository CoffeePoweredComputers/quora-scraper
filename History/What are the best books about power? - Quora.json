She also has a pitch-dark sense of humor that she wields perfectly.\" --Michael Schaub, NPR In THE POWER, the world is a recognizable place: there's a rich Nigerian boy who lounges around the family pool; a foster kid whose religious parents hide their true nature; an ambitious American politician; a tough London girl from a tricky family. But then a vital new force takes root and flourishes, causing their lives to converge with devastating effect. Teenage girls now have immense physical power--they can cause agonizing pain and even death. And, with this small twist of nature, the world drastically resets. From award-winning author Naomi Alderman, THE POWER is speculative fiction at its most ambitious and provocative, at once taking us on a thrilling journey to an alternate reality, and exposing our own world in bold and surprising ways.

Anyway, each power struggle is another type of war. According to Britannica: \u2018\u2019 Sunzi, Wade-Giles romanization Sun-tzu, also spelled Sun Tzu, personal name Sun Wu, (flourished 5th century BC), reputed author of the Chinese classic Bingfa (The Art of War), the earliest known treatise on war and military science. Sunzi, a military strategist and general who served the state of Wu near the end of the Spring and Autumn Period (770\u2013476 BC), is traditionally considered the author of The Art of War, but the work is more likely to have been written early in the Warring States period (475\u2013221 BC), at a time when China was divided into six or seven states that often resorted to war with each other in their struggles for supremacy. The Art of War is a systematic guide to strategy and tactics for rulers and commanders. The book discusses various maneuvers and the effect of terrain on the outcome of battles. It stresses the importance of accurate information about the enemy\u2019s forces, dispositions and deployments, and movements. This is summarized in the axiom \u201cKnow the enemy and know yourself, and you can fight a hundred battles with no danger of defeat.\u201d It also emphasizes the unpredictability of battle and the use of flexible strategies and tactics. The book\u2019s insistence on the close relationship between political considerations and military policy greatly influenced some modern strategists. Mao Zedong and the Chinese communists took from The Art of War many of the tactics they utilized in fighting the Japanese and, later, the Chinese Nationalists. \u2018\u2019 Source: Sunzi | Chinese strategist  Source of the picture: The Art Of War Summary + PDF - Four Minute Books \u201cThe supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.\u201d \u2015 Sun Tzu, The Art of War \u201cAppear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.\u201d \u2015 Sun Tzu, The Art of War \u201cTo know your Enemy, you must become your Enemy.\u201d \u2015 Sun Tzu \u201cOpportunities multiply as they are seized.\u201d \u2015 Sun Tzu Source of the quotes: Sun Tzu Quotes (Author of The Art of War) ",
