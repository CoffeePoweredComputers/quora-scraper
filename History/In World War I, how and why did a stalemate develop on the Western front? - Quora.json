            "answer_text": "How: there were enough troops on either side to man the entire front line from Switzerland to the sea, and the state of technological advance at the time favoured prepared defence over offence - not just machine guns and artillery, but also the limitations on communication which made it impossible for attacking commanders to respond to changing situations. Why: after the failure of the Schlieffen plan and defeat at the Marne in Autumn 1914, the Germans had a war on two (or indeed more) fronts to manage. They concluded that they could withdraw to favourable defensive positions in France and hold them while concentrating on the Eastern front - following the principle of reinforcing success, after their big victory at Tannenberg. They made few large scale attacks on the Western front with the aim of gaining ground until April 1918 after the Russians had left the war (Second Ypres is probably the main exception; the attack at Verdun was an attempt to wear down French army manpower rather than an attempt to improve a position). The French, British and Belgians were effectively forced onto the offensive as their primary purpose was to push the Germans back off occupied French and Belgian soil, but did not manage to combine the manpower, tactical doctrine and technical advances needed to do so until the last year of the war .

            "answer_text": "The Germans tried to push into Paris but French reconnaissance found German armies and counterattackes. WW 1 was fought with new weapons and it was almost slaughter to try to advance so each side dug in and started building defenses. The trenches stretched hugely on the western front. Any advance from any side was met with a barrage of weapon fire. For example in the battle of the Somme almost no land was gained but huge amounts of soldiers died. In effect the new weapons and the digging in of the western front effectively stalemated the war. ",
