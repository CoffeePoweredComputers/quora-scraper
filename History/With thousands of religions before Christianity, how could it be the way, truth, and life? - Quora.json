            "answer_text": "I think this depends on how you interpret \u201cthe way, truth, and life\u201d. If you interpret it as being a strict \u201cChristianity is the only path to God\u201d, then it seems pretty problematic. But not all Christians adhere to a strict \u201cChristianity is the only correct religion\u201d. For example, the New Church, which follows the writings of Emmanuel Swedenborg, has a belief that anyone who sincerely questions and seeks out the truth, will end up close to God, no matter what type of belief system they are raised within, including both atheistic and polytheistic belief systems. This belief makes sense to me. I actually know a number of mainstream Christians (i.e. members of various denominations) who came to the same or similar conclusions on their own, through reflection, prayer, reason, and logic. We\u2019re all doing the best we can in live, to discern the truth. It makes some sense that if a person believes in a particular religion or belief system, that they would think that that religion is the \u201cmost true\u201d, at least if they, like most forms of Protestantism do, place a lot of emphasis on correctness of belief. (Not all religions, not even all forms of Christianity, have this emphasis.) But when we start adhering strictly to this idea that one religion is \u201ccorrect\u201d and the others are all \u201cfalse\u201d, in an all-or-nothing fashion, this leads to all sorts of harmful outcomes. For one, you get a smug, superior attitude towards religion, which seems to me to be fundamentally at odds with the core teachings of Chrisitainty as I understand them, and as they are depicted in the gospels in the Bible. The Gospels depict religious sects of the Pharisees and Sadducees as having this sort of attitude, and they\u2019re depicted as hypocrites and as the \u201cbad guys\u201d in the story so to speak, an example to the readers and to Christians of \u201chow not to be\u201d. For two, you often get hate too, you get Christian missionaries coming in and destroying traditional and indigenous cultures because they\u2019re \u201cevil\u201d or \u201cblasphemous\u201d. Again, this is at odds with a lot of core Christian values, and seems woefully out of touch with the narrative in the gospels. And thirdly you get just absurd stuff like \u201csoul counting\u201d, groups that try to \u201csave\u201d as many people as possible and it\u2019s all shallow, like, getting people to profess faith in Jesus Christ in front of some crowd, out of social pressure, people spreading their religion in ways that emphasize counting numbers of people instead of quality and sincerity of faith. Again this seems out of touch with the core teachings of Christianity. So I think all these things make clear that I soldly reject (and I think it\u2019s common sense to reject) these sort of narrow, rigid interpretations of Christianity that insist adherents to other religions are damned and their belief systems are blasphemous. So back to the original question, with this in mind. I think people can believe Christianity is the way, truth, and life, without necessarily rejecting or condemning other religions. When Jesus came on the scene, and in the ensuing years and processes after that, something new took form. Christians happen to be the people who believe that this is the best we can do, the closest to truth. Not all Christians though believe that all these other religions are false or heretical. A lot of them believe, like I do, and like some denominations even formally believe, that if a person grows up in any tradition and sincerely seeks the truth, they will become closer to God. So in this framework, these other religions are just the best people can do. Who knows exactly which aspects of their beliefs are true and good, and which aren\u2019t? I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not omniscient. But I\u2019m not about to totally judge or dismiss any of them, that seems absurd to me, and I think this points out the absurdity and falsehood in the literalistic, fundamentalist forms of Christianity and other religions, that strongly condemn other religions. That, to me, seems the only contradiction here. ",

            "answer_text": "No religion predates what we now know as Christianity, since the first Gospel preacher was God Himself. He came looking for Adam and Eve, who acknowledged their guilt before Him. Then He told them of the coming of \u201cthe seed of the woman\u201d who would crush the head of Satan, even though it would be personally painful. Seed of the woman is a direct reference to the virgin birth of Christ, as woman do not in the natural have seed. God then killed innocent animals (the first blood ever shed on earth- picturing Christ\u2019s blood) and which also would done at the hands of God the Father. The hides of these animals were fashioned into garments to cover the nakedness of the first two sinners. This spiritually pictured their sinfulness being covered in the sight of God by the robe of Christ\u2019s righteousness after having the penalty for sin paid by the blood of Jesus. Christianity and all other dispensations from Adam, thru Abraham to the first advent and into the Millennium have salvation by grace through faith in Christ\u2019s blood as the unifying truth. Many also ran ancient religions had,even as today\u2019s new age religions, mutations of aspects of the story of redemption mixed into their errors. ",
