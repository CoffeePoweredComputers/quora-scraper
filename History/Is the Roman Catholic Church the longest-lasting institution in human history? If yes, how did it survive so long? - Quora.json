            "answer_text": "The Catholic Church is one of the oldest continuous elected institutions, though there are other religions like Buddhism that are much older, and other people have already mentioned Japan\u2019s extremely ancient monarchy. To answer your question, while devout Catholics would claim the church\u2019s longevity shows it was divinely inspired, I find a more logical explanation for the Catholic Church\u2019s ability to outlast other institutions is because for 2000 years they have promised our ultimate fate is not the grave, where other institutions, and especially monarchies during this time have come and gone. Cultures change and evolve over time, but humans have always wanted to believe our lives have meaning now, and that we have a place in the hereafter \u2014or want to know where did I come from, why am I here, and where am I going? No other institution has been able to appeal to such basic human questions at such a scale than the Catholic Church, not now, in the Middle Ages, or in Ancient Roman times, which could be the reason they are so good at surviving, even with the many scandals they have been involved in over the centuries.

            "answer_text": "The Catholic Papacy\u2019s apostolic succession (along with the Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch and Jerusalem) are most likely the world\u2019s oldest; then, followed closely by the Armenian and Malankara (Mar Thoma) Christians of India. The only institution I know of that claims a more ancient origin (6th cent. B.C.) is the Chrysanthemum Throne of Japan. However, modern scholarship, supported by recent discoveries in the Japanese archeological field, now tends toward a revised dating of around the 4th to the 6th cent. A.D. While on the other hand, the Roman Church\u2019s papacy is well attested in ancient records as well as archaeology down to modern times. Even so, to respond to the last part of your question, if you would ask a Catholic the question as to why it survived so long, they no doubt would point you to the Gospel of St. Matthew 16:18\u2014 \u201cAnd I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\u201d ",
