            "answer_text": "We have beautiful, cultivated, and vivid internal worlds. Because of this we don't feel the need to entertain people. If being ourselves isn't enough, that's ok. INFJs don't care. INFJs may be perceived as boring if someone doesn't know us deeply and doesn't try to. INFJs make great first impressions but unless someone is consistently trying to get to know them, they'll take it as a sign the relationship wasn't meant to be (they won't force any camaraderie). And from then on you'll only ever see the bare minimum of an INFJ\u2019s personality which can be boring compared to how interesting and fun they truly are. And also those people that are into going crazy and doing reckless shit in the name of \u201cfun\u201d are going to find INFJs to be the party pooper or grandma (I've actually been called that). Because an INFJ\u2019s sense of fun comes from within not the other way around. We don\u2019t need drugs, alcohol, or peer pressure from extroverts to have a good time. We need fresh air, open-minded people, a couple lighthearted conversationalists, and our imagination. We're high on life already and if you can't see pass the \u201cboring\u201d 1.) You're missing out 2.) You're not putting enough effort into cracking the INFJ's shell. And I know, the shell is thick. But what's inside is magical. I love INFJs so much. ",

            "answer_text": "INFJs are the least boring people. They have the capabilities of acting like an extrovert, and are socially capable enough to blend in with new people and easily make friends. They also have their quiet intuitive side, so they are the perfect wingman for a social event. They can easily see when you\u2019re getting peopled out and can come up with an escape plan. They have an enormous creative capacity so they can make staying home on a rainy day fun. There is a competitive aspect to them so they can be fun to play games with that involve on the spot creativity. Pictionary comes to mind\u2026. They are not the most patient people which usually translates to wanting to stay engaged and keep the surrounding content new and fresh. They always want to go on a drive, do some activity like cooking or playing with the dogs\u2026 anything stimulating. They light up a room of people when they get comfortable, telling jokes and poking fun in a good natured and light hearted way. They are also really good at managing groups of intermixed friends and making everyone feel welcome and included. ",
