            "answer_text": "China has more than four times as many people as the United States. The only way it can be kept beneath the United States in GDP is if the average Chinese citizen produces less than 25% as much as the average American citizen. It is absolutely inevitable that China\u2019s economy will pass the United States economy. We should root for this because failure to do so would represent an economic catastrophe of horrific magnitude (even worse than Mao\u2019s economic policies, which killed tens of millions, kept over a billion people in extreme poverty, and held the China back for decades). And indeed, the United States has a long history of supporting better economics for the people of China (although obviously Deng Xiaoping deserves the bulk of the credit). Japan has less than 40% as many people as the United States. For a brief moment in 1991, their GDP per capita was nearly 10% higher than the US. People drew all sorts of unreasonable assumptions based on this. When I started MIT, all freshmen were asked to read a book about how Japan is kicking our ass. But Japan was NEVER likely to catch the United States in terms of raw economic power. So the main difference is that China is certain to pass the US, and Japan was always certain not to. ",

            "answer_text": "Japan\u2019s economic growth was less a challenge and more a peak. Japan used its collectivist culture that values detailed precision. To grow heavy industries and supply quality related international products to the international market. These products ranged from consumer products right up to industrial goods. But it peaked and then declined to more sustainable levels. There is 100+million people in Japan and the landmass is a long relatively thin island archipelago. Japan is very resource poor. China on the other hand is a large land mass comparable to the US. It has over 1 billion+ people. It has access to a diverse range of resources in its own country that Japan never had. The US and the west gave a majority of its manufacturing capacity to China. It\u2019s has a collectivist culture but one that is more authoritarian than the Japanese. It is a quasi capitalist state. The state has extensive powers but does allow capitalist independence to exist if it doesn\u2019t interfere with the state. Ultimately China is a capitalist state that the US never had to compete against before. The USSR the US\u2019 biggest competitor to date failed not so much because of the US but in spite of it. With excessive controls on human interaction that stuffed up the economy. The USSR was run by party ideologs. After Mao China was run by engineers but is now run by people that look to understand and manage capitalism. ",
