            "answer_text": "This is really two questions - \u201cHow were Gentlemen supposed to behave\u201d and \u201cHow did Gentlemen behave\u201d The first had whole books devoted to it and whole books to dress and deportment alone. A gentleman did not answer his own door, a gentleman did not carry a brown paper parcel tied up with string, a gentleman did not unfurl his umbrella unless it was absolutely tipping it down, a gentleman walked on the road side of the pavement when accompanying a lady, at the racecourse a gentleman himself never approached the betting office, when paying a social call a gentleman never gave a reason for leaving, a gentleman did not dance continuously with one and the same lady\u2026 (and that is scratching the surface). They were supposed to set an example Unfortunately for this ideal many gentlemen were very wealthy and had lots of time on their hands and great privacy. This spawned lots of opportunities for bad behaviour. Also the bad sort of gentleman also seemed, almost by some fatal instinct, to flock together which produced a sort of mutual escalation. By the later Victorian era, fortunately for their survival, the wiser older people in the gentry had mastered robust legal methods of trickle feeding their cash to the less wise younger ones so it was much less frequent for whole family fortunes to be squandered at White\u2019s (a Gentleman\u2019s Club at the top of St James Street) like they were in the Georgian days. Massive debt was a way of life for Gentlemen - many businesses that catered to them worked on the basis that they would receive about a quarter of what they were owed each year. This was one of the reasons that high class products were very expensive. A dark side of this was mercenary marriages and insincere courtships. A gentleman marrying was often a great cause for celebration amongst local tradesmen. So, when it comes to the second, all human life is here from gay postman fetishes to snot sandwiches. ",

            "answer_text": "I think what all these answers miss is the blatant hypocrisy of the Victorian era. Sure, Victorian gentlemen were, in general, unscrupulously polite to members of their own social class, especially women, but they felt no such compunctions towards members of lower social classes. And here\u2019s where we get into the dark underbelly of Victorian London. Snobbery was rampant (for instance, the upper classes considered the middle class to be a bunch of upstarts who, to quote Dickens \u201csmelt a little too much of the workshop\u201d \u2014 ie, they made their money by *gasp* working for it instead of having inherited it or coming by it in some other genteel fashion). The poor were obviously poor because they deserved it (either through sin, vice, or laziness), rather than through bad luck and circumstances being stacked against them. Workhouses didn\u2019t exist to help the poor, they existed to punish them, and Victorian gentlemen felt a sense of smug superiority that they weren\u2019t those dreadful poor people and never would be. And then there\u2019s the whole issue of gender and the various ways that Victorian prudery and the Cult of the Home played out. Victorian men were quite polite to other women within their social class, in public. In private, it was perfectly reasonable to \u201ccorrect\u201d (beat) your wife, they were the legal owners of all their wives property (even income the wives earned themselves) and they could dispose of it any way they cared to, there was no legal concept of marital rape, and they could send their wives away and prevent them from seeing their own children if the relationship became acrimonious. A woman could be cast off pretty much at will, and it did happen (the old phrase \u201cplaying the Dickens\u201d actually relates to how Charles Dickens treated his wife of decades, gaslighting her, insulting her to her friends, and finally casting her off for a teenage actress after she\u2019d borne him numerous children. and restricting her access to those children). Oh, yeah, and having a mistress was super-common (but heaven forbid the wives have a piece on the side). Often, these mistresses were fully financially supported by the men (their own homes, regular cash allowances, gifts) and sometimes the men even maintained whole separate families with their mistresses. All of this money could, of course, have been contributing to his legal wife and children, but there was no recourse since all property was the husband\u2019s to dispose of how he wished. And then there were the prostitutes, hundreds of thousands in London alone. And, rather than assume that this was a problem of the lower class, we need to bear in mind that the lower class didn\u2019t actually have that much discretionary income to speak of. By and large, prostitutes were a way for \u201crespectable\u201d men not to sully respectable women but still let off steam. For much of the (very long) Victorian era prostitution wasn\u2019t even considered all that big a deal (although, towards the end of the era, moral crusaders started to take note). And, despite their liking for loose women, a premium was placed on virginity. Brothels would auction off the virginity of young females (sometimes repeatedly) and a journalist named Stead demonstrated that it was actually possible to buy a virgin outright (not her virginity, but HER) for 5 pounds (several thousand pounds in modern buying power). What I\u2019m trying to say is that, in many ways, Victorian gentlemen led two lives. There was a polite, classy, sophisticated, moral public life, and then there was a private life that would make modern tabloid journalists drool. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a very big question \u2014 the Victorian era was long, and the world and England changed a lot in that time. One thing that one might highlight, though, is that this was the era in which gentlemen were expected to set an example. In 18th century England, there was little sense that an aristocrat was expected to behave better than anyone else. By the time of Dickens, though, a sense was beginning to exist that those in the higher social strata had a responsibility to behave well. Perhaps this was an outcome of increased availability of information and of the era of European revolutions \u2014 there was a greater need for those at the top of the social heap to justify their privilege by doing something positive. Perhaps this tied in with Empire. Not sure \u2014 but certainly, it\u2019s something distinctive about the Victorian concept of a gentleman. Another point one could mention is that in many ways Victorian England was a kind of warrior society, emphasizing courage under fire and an honorable death \u2014 there was a great emphasis on physical bravery, and acts of personal courage (and gratuitous risk-taking) that seem quite insane now were fairly common \u2014 not only in warfare and exploration but in foxhunting, for example. Perhaps it had something to do with the Napoleonic wars, and perhaps something to do with the Empire again \u2014 certainly both those things created both a need for tough men, and a supply of tough men who sometimes lacked much of an outlet for their skills. The idea that an Englishman should be able to physically fight against superior odds, rally the troops and survive in hostile conditions generally came in with the Victorian era and didn\u2019t become unfashionable again until the aftermath of World War 1. Just two points among many. The Victorian gentleman would have seemed very moral and responsible to his 18th century equivalent, and would have seemed very tough and brave to his 17th century equivalent. He would also have seemed very uninterested in fashion, by comparison to the near-obsession with clothes that marked Europe in preceding eras. He would also, sadly, very often have unfortunate facial hair\u2026 ",

Locker room talk was confined to men only, and then only in the privacy of the billiard room from which women were excluded. But basically these rules tended to apply when dealing with ladies. With the lower orders in the streets of London or in the brothels things were rather different. A little story involving junior officers and a Madame who had been had up before the courts for running a child brothel for paedophile members of the upper orders may illustrate this nicely. When the barristers managed to get the case dismissed, the officers unhooked the horses from her carriage and hauled her in triumph through the streets of London. ",

The woman's space was the home and she had to submit to the male. To alterate that order, they said, was to go against the law of God and against nature itself. As you can see those tauhgts still valid today with a rather small variation, the ideas and behavior haven\u00b4t changed that much. To be a gentleman demands still certain qualities like honesty, good behavior towards society, punktuality, cleanliness, and following the stablished order, rules and traditions. ",

            "answer_text": "Victorian gentleman in the upper class behaved socially and proper. Young Victorian gentleman would make the decisions to their marriage (women had no rights back then). Middle Class gentleman would behave like any ordinary gentleman if they had a proffesion like a doctor, teacher, bookseller or worked in a store. Upper class gentleman would spend their times in nightclubs talking about political stuff, marriages, history, art etc & drinking brandy. Gentleman in low class areas behaved like slums even to their wives (some would rape women) and go out drinking in bars and use gutter language and some would steal from upper class people. ",
