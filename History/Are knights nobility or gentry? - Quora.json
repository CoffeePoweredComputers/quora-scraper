            "answer_text": "At first they were lower gentry, and in late medeival times they had to be born noble and were called milites nobiles, and then knighthood was more limited to the nobles only. From the 15th to 18th centuries the Lords helped appointing Knights of the 50 shires from the gentry to influence and lead the commons in parliament. The Royal house has appointed around 250 European Royal honorary knights in the last 600 years. And the Order of the Garter from 1350 is a noble knighthood only for the sovereign, the Prince of Wales and maximum 24 living persons. In Sweden there is a House of Nobility since 400 years called the House of Knights, which was the seat of the Nobles in the Parliament of the Four States, until abolished via reforms in representation in 1865.

Other countries vary. Some do not have formal aristocracies anymore, but the knights would have been included at the time when the aristocracies fell (still got beheaded in the French Revolution). ",
