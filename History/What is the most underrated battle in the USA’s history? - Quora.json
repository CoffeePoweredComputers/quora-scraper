            "answer_text": "The defence of the Phillipines from December1941 to May 1942. Up to Then the Axis Forces had achieved fast victories and used that momentum to push on for more victories. In the Phillipines the determined defence put up by the US and local Forces was by far the longest defensive battle by the allies. It slowed the Japanese advance southwards which was critical to keep Australia safe. Holding up the Japanese for six months at the time they every where else achieved fast, overwhelming victories was strategically critical. Although a tactical loss, the BotP was arguably as strategically important for US success as the victories at Midway and Guadalcanal. Had the Phillipines fallen as quickly as, say, the crushing defeat of the British in Singapore, the Southern Pacific campaign would have been very different indeed. It was a defeat but the US made the Japanese work so hard and long for it that it helped turn the tide of war against them. It has an equivalence with say Dunkirk 1940 in Western Europe, where the nature of defeat helped achieve the later victory. ",
