            "answer_text": "I don't believe \u201chate\u201d is the correct word. Envy would be a better choice. Russia has always been sort of the redheaded step child of the \u201cfirst world\u201d while America has been the \u201cgolden boy\u201d since WWI. The Russian economy has never lived up to the promise of Marx, while the American\u2019s thrived in complete contradiction to Marx and the Soviet leader\u2019s predictions. World War II was a horrible, tragic event for the Soviets. Their country was wrecked by the invading Germans. They suffered horrendous casualties both on the battle field and in civilian areas. America, however, was virtually untouched and received the credit for victory over the Nazis. During the Cold War era, Russia was really only at the table because of her military might which, while large, was mostly about her atomic weapons. She never developed a true blue water navy that could challenge the American preeminence and lagged behind in almost every technological area compared to the west and especially America. The deficit militarially was brutally demonstrated by the first Gulf War when America\u2019s technological edge was displayed for the entire world against Soviet weapons, which at the time, were first line systems. I suppose the world treats Russia a bit like that brutish neighbor who thinks he is cultured but is looked down upon with a bit of pity by everyone else. Russia realizes this and is constantly struggling to prove they really are better. Their attempts are generally on the brute force side so they make no progress toward their goal of actual acceptance by the West. ",

            "answer_text": "Au contraire. Russia does not hate the United States. Judging by Russia\u2019s action of hacking Hillary\u2019s private bathroom server, it should be obvious they love America by exposing the truth about Hillary\u2019s illegal activity. They could easily have helped the American Media cover up Hillary\u2019s deceitfulness, and stayed silent which may have resulted in Crooked Hillary becoming President. The Russians exposing the truth prevented that disaster. The Russians are actually more patriotic than the American media. They saw illegal activity and they made sure Americans knew about it. The American media tried to seeep Hillary\u2019s crimes under the rug. I trust the Russians way more than the Libs and leftists in America. Russia didn't say anything bad about America. They simply provided the verbatim truth. No distortion of the facts. No opinions. No innuendo. Wow. Wouldn't it be great if CNN and MSNBC reported the news like the Russians? Just the facts, Jack! ",
