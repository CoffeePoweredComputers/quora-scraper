            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll try to answer your question because I was embroiled in a dilemma quite similar to this, the previous year. I wanted to pursue a degree in English from a reputable college in India. Enough said. I took on the task of researching some of the best institutes in the country for the same and the results were narrowed down to the following colleges- Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi UniversitySt. Stephen\u2019s College, Delhi UniversitySt. Xavier\u2019s College, MumbaiFergusson College, PuneChrist University, BangaloreSymbiosis School of Liberal Arts, PuneMy top ranked choices, LSR and Stephen\u2019s, were the most difficult to get into, owing to the admission criteria which solely depends upon the sky-high (literally) \u2018cutoffs\u2019. Anything below a 95 in your Boards wouldn't work for LSR and Stephen\u2019s would set the bar higher with more than a 97%. The good thing is, there is no dearth of excellent institutions in our country. If your 12th Grade marks fall short of these astronomically high marks, try your luck in the other colleges from the aforementioned. Christ University and Symbiosis, Pune have their own entrance examinations and interview which is a more holistic admission process. Good Luck! ",
