            "answer_text": "Regardless of most answers to this question, I would say that Romans did not care that much about race, in the sense most answers have used the term. It's very easy to apply current standards and prejudices to ancient times. Of course there were prejudices - they were human, alas!   There were prejudices against people living outside the Empire - they were mostly thought of as barbarians - and from a civilised Roman's perspective, they were. During the first centuries of the Empire, Roman Citizenship was very restricted, and given only to people whom the Romans thought could benefit them (St. Paul was a Roman Citizen, as his father had been a panjandrum in Tarsus). Not being a citizen meant that you lacked a lot of rights (and had to pay taxes, and serve in the Army (so, not very much as in the U.S., eh?).  Not being a citizen means that you could not participate in Roman politics, i.e. your life span was probably longer. You could, however, be a politician  in your province.  In general, Romans (in Italy) probably did their best to look down on those strange creatures living in the provinces (sort of like, I have been told, the French look at Belgians - they speak the same language, but THEY EAT LOBSTER WITH MAYONNAISE...) . But there was no discrimination based on skin colour or any such physical attributes. Very soon, Gauls were made senators and the like. Once the barbarians had been romanized, they were eligible. in AD 212 the Roman Emperor Caracalla made all free men in the Empire citizenship, and gave free women the same rights as Roman women. After that,  the throne was up for grabs for anyone ruthless, capable and suicidal enough to want it. Race, the way it is perceived by many today, is an effect of slavery. Now, in Antiquity, slaves were almost always enemies defeated in battle. Most Greek slaves were people from next door; Roman slaves were also initially POW's. Later on, when the steady stream om vanquished neighbours dwindled, slave farms were created. But Roman slaves had rights, and the son of a freed slave could easily became a Roman Citizen. The Imperial administration in Rome was almost entirely staffed by freedmen and slaves (mostly because they were more reliable than citizens and would not gain much from conspiring...). This sort of slavery disappeared more or less with the fall of West Rome (serfs were not slaves). However, slavery continued in the East (i.e., what we today call the Middle East). After the Muslim conquest of most of that part, a problem arose. A muslim could not be a slave, so a new source had to be found. East Africa was the solution! The people there were not muslims, and therefore a legitimate target. African chiefs soon saw the economic advantage of selling their enemies (and, sometimes, their friends) to Muslim traders. When the Western merchants came to West Africa, the chiefs were altogether too happy to deal with them, too. And as the Caribbean sugar plantations had run out of Indians, Africans was the solution the the problem!  Now, Europe by this time had come to the realization that slavery Was Not A Good Thing, generally. But, if we start regarding blacks as somewhat subhuman, our consciences could be allayed. Romans did not think like that, at all. The current infectious undercurrents (and, sometimes, overcurrents) of  'racial discrimination' is due to a lethal combination of Middle East slavery, greedy African chiefs and the European sweet tooth  (mostly, but by no means exclusively, supplied by the British, I am afraid). There are, of course, differences between people of different ancestry. But these differences are, as we all know, cosmetic. And prejudices are almost always directed at minorities - if they look different. When Mussolini got in bed with Hitler, they tried to introduce the German brand of antisemitism, but it didn't work. Italian Jews did not look that different from the ordinary (especially southern) Italians. ",

            "answer_text": "Racism was a big issue in Rome and a main course of its decline and fall. BUT: Racism had nothing to do with skincolour (the kind of racism that americans are obsessed with). No racism from the beginningFrom the beginning there was no racism in Rome. The USP of Rome was that is was an open society that welcomed any man who was in need of a fresh start. If you were prepared to fight and die for Rome you would also be allowed to live in Rome. This made Rome a very assimilative society. It was a good idea to change your ethnicity and become a roman. Entire people converted and became romans  If you were roman citizen you were in, regardless of your skincolour. On the other hand, if you were born a slave or somehow became a slave, you were not human, not even subhuman. You were a thing. A tool with ability to speak. This had nothing to do with skincolour. The declineAs the Roman empire growth it became less attractive for romans to be soldiers. It meant to walk a very long distance, carrying an enourmous burden and if you would come home it would be after a very long time. So the romans did not want to be soldiers. Over time they lost their abilities to fight in an army. Instead the roman wars were fought by forreign people. First soldiers were recruited one at the time. Later on entire people were enrolled into the roman army. Ordinary work was done be slaves. Even what we would consider very qualified and attractive work was done by slaves. For a roman citizen it would be degrading to do the work of a slave. Deprived of their ability and will to work or to fight the romans prefered to live of welfare. This was a very boring way of life but was made bearable by a large amounth of easy entertainment (As looking at people beeing killed). The only thing the roman citizen had to offer in return for bread and spectacle was their vote. Rome was a city that produced little but the political legitimity that the political elit needed. Racism developsThe leader of the Roman Empire used to be choosen from the best and the brightest of the army leaders. A succesfull general could be emperor. Now where all good soldiers and competent general germans. They wished nothing more than to be romans. But the roman citizens realised that they could not compete with the germans (as they spend their lazy days with pleasure and entertainment). The romans became convinced that competence what not enough . You had to be a roman to benefit from the Roman Empire. Only a Roman could be emperor and germans could never be romans. Racism destroys The EmpireThe situation was know that only incompetent men could be emperor. There where several men who could have saved The Empire but they were all germans and thus not allowed to save The Empire.  The worst waste was Aetius. He was not only a roman aristocrat he could also act as an german king or even a hunn (he lived several years as a hostage with the hunns). He was perfect to unite romans and germans. He was the best candidate to be emperor but was murdered by the emperor himself. ConclusionRacism develops when priviliged people does not have any other arguments for their priviligies.  Racism is a destructive force Racism can hit regardless of skincolour(Just look how burakumin is treated in Japan) ",

            "answer_text": "No, the Romans nor the Greeks before them (nor any civilization before) were not racists. They had practiced discrimination, but not based on race. The modern concept of 'race' was born out of the organized 'slave trade' of Black Africans, first practiced by the Arabs after the fall of the Roman Empire (see Greger Leijonhufvud's answer), and which culminated into the Trans-Atlantic African slave trade.  I addition to Greger Leijonhufvud's excellent answer...   Source: International Socialist Review  \"The classical empires of Greece and Rome were based on slave labor. But ancient slavery was not viewed in racial terms. Slaves were most often captives in wars or conquered peoples. If we understand white people as originating in what is today Europe, then most slaves in ancient Greece and Rome were white. Roman law made slaves the property of their owners, while maintaining a \u201cformal lack of interest in the slave\u2019s ethnic or racial provenance.\u201d Over the years, slave manumission produced a mixed population of slave and free in Roman-ruled areas in which all came to be seen as \u201cRomans.\u201d5 The Greeks drew a sharper line between Greeks and \u201cbarbarians,\u201d those subject to slavery. Again, this was not viewed in racial or ethnic terms, as the socialist historian of the Haitian Revolution, C.L.R. James, explained: [H]istorically it is pretty well proved now that the ancient Greeks and Romans knew nothing about race. They had another standard\u2014civilized and barbarian\u2014and you could have white skin and be a barbarian and you could be black and civilized.6 More importantly, encounters in the ancient world between the Mediterranean world and black Africans did not produce an upsurge of racism against Africans. In Before Color Prejudice, Howard University classics professor Frank Snowden documented innumerable accounts of interaction between the Greco-Roman and Egyptian civilizations and the Kush, Nubian, and Ethiopian kingdoms of Africa. He found substantial evidence of integration of black Africans in the occupational hierarchies of the ancient Mediterranean empires and Black-white intermarriage. Black and mixed race gods appeared in Mediterranean art, and at least one Roman emperor, Septimius Severus, was an African. Snowden concluded: There is little doubt that many blacks were physically assimilated into the predominantly white population of the Mediterranean world, in which there were no institutional barriers or social pressures against black-white unions. In antiquity, then, black-white sexual relations were never the cause of great emotional crises.The ancient pattern, similar in some respects to the Mahgrebian and the Latin American attitude toward racial mixture, probably contributed to the absence of a pronounced color prejudice in antiquity.7 Between the 10th and 16th centuries, the chief source of slaves in Western Europe was Eastern Europe. In fact, the word \u201cslave\u201d comes from the word \u201cSlav,\u201d the people of Eastern Europe. In the Middle Ages, most people sold into slavery in Europe came from Eastern Europe, the Slavic countries. In Eastern Europe, Russia stood out as the major area where slaveholders and slaves were of the same ethnicity. Of course, by modern-day racial descriptions the Slavs and Russian slaves were white. This outline doesn\u2019t mean to suggest a \u201cpre-capitalist\u201d Golden Age of racial tolerance, least of all in the slave societies of antiquity. Empires viewed themselves as centers of the universe and looked on foreigners as inferiors. Ancient Greece and Rome fought wars of conquest against peoples they presumed to be less advanced. Religious scholars interpreted the Hebrew Bible\u2019s \u201ccurse of Ham\u201d from the story of Noah to condemn Africans to slavery. Cultural and religious associations of the color white with light and angels and the color black with darkness and evil persisted. But none of these cultural or ideological factors explain the rise of New World slavery or the \u201cmodern\u201d notions of racism that developed from it.\"  ",

The appearance of, say, a typical native of western Europe might differ in general appearance to the average inhabitant of Palmyra but that was about it. There were civilised people - Romans (obviously) and Greeks, and other more useful foreigners like Egyptians - provincials, and barbarians\u2026 who seem to have generally been assumed to be either so far beneath contempt they were assumed to be semi-human or the malign spawn of a competing power (one that had graduated from pathetic to representing a palpable threat).* The unique selling point of Rome, as has already been noted, is that wholesale adoption of Rome's laws, social and civic obligations - including a willingness to unstintingly pay taxes - yielded full citizenship status, and the eventual inclusion of provincials in the senate, and in time the imperial line of succession. In short a Roman might be described as having physical characteristics that could be called racial where we would use national or geographical labels, so long as the \u2018race\u2019 was considered a member of the club, and not a despised barbarian, it was a descriptive term, much like the IC system. (And seemingly put to much the same purpose.) See IC codes - Wikipedia Physical Description of Jesus * A little like the simplistic treatment of foreigners in low production value genre action movies and unabashed modern propaganda peices from the Nazi era onwards.

Carthage was perhaps the most obvious, after fighting 3 wars, the Romans made sure there would be no 4th war. There was  a certain amount of cultural fear and loathing of the Carthaginians, based on cultural snobbery on the part of the Romans... but it was not a 'color' factor. This was not based on 'skin' color, but competition for resources in the Mediterranean... The Romans after 3 wars with the Jews in Judea and the Eastern Mediterranean, made sure there was no 4th war, again with 'eradicating' results for those in the eastern Mediterranean. There were many other enclaves of Jews throughout the empire and they were not eradicated at the same time, to the same degree as in Palestine. The Romans however were never really able to subdue the Germans beyond the Rhine or what is now north Bavaria/Austria, despite number of battles or military expeditions. The Romans were never really able to subdue the eastern Middle East.  ",
