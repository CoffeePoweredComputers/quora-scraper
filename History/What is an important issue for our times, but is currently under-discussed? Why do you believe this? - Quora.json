            "answer_text": "While the 7/24 media is distracting everyone with petty politics and heads getting chopped off the financial elites are losing control and are going to plunge the entire world into chaos. 2008 was just a dress rehearsal. Sovereign debt, not just in the US but worldwide, ballooning to historic levels. This means that the only way the debt can be retired will be through massive inflation and currency devaluation. People with assets are not concerned with inflation because the nominal \u201cvalue\u201d of their assets increase with inflation. In other words, if your home is worth $500,000 and it jumps to $900,000 you\u2019re not too concerned, except everything else you pay for has also increased. If you\u2019re well off it\u2019s not a problem but if you\u2019re on a fixed income or living paycheck to paycheck, you\u2019re screwed, little by little. The elites are a lot more afraid of a devaluation. What do you think will happen if China and the Arabs refuse to accept dollars? When gas went from $0.249 to $0.499 practically overnight, a lot of middle class families were hurt, especially when everything else was allowed to creep up, but not the wages. In 1971 the Federal Minimum wage was $1.60 and one hour of work would buy 6 gallons of gas. Now the minimum wage is $7.25 and you can only get 2 gallons of gas for one hour of work. And this has happened across the board. Why do you think so many families need to have two incomes just make ends meet? If they do it like they did before and slowly inflate the currency and not devalue the dollar you\u2019ll see the minimum wage at $72,50/hour, but gas will probably be $72.50/gallon. If they lose control like they did in 2008 some of the power companies won\u2019t be able to buy fuel at any price and the lights and gas will go down. People living in high rises will be screwed. ATMs won\u2019t work. I needn\u2019t go into all the possible scenarios, but it could get really ugly.  ",

It stems from one group of people finding power over another. It's based on ridiculous ideas, like your skin color, gender, sexual orientation or religion somehow makes you special. You're not. We are all gooey unachieving carbon based life forms. We all bleed red. What can\u2019t we get along? Thanks for the A2A ",
