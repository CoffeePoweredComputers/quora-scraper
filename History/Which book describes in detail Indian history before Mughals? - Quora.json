            "answer_text": "I think that there is a vast time period of nearly two thousand years of the known and recognised history of India before the Mughal period.Thus, it is not possible to cover this vast time period in one book,but I shall try to suggest a number of books which may help you to cover it as far as possible. For a general reader, the first book is \u201cThe Wonder that was India\u201d written by A L Basham. This will give you many insights covering in great details about the life, society, culture, philosophy, architecture etc of the ancient India. The second book is \u201cThe History of India(Volume1)\u201dby Romilla Thaper published by the Penguin publishing house .It covers the period from the ancient to the early medieval period of India before the advent of the Mughals.For the political history, you can go through the books of L. Mukherjee. The books published by the NCERT for +2 are also very relevant. You can go through the books by Sri NeelKanth Shastri for the history of the South India.The book \u201cThe History of India(Three Parts)\u201dby the three authors published by the Macmillan is also quite useful, covering the three periods of this great country. I hope that you will find it useful. ",
