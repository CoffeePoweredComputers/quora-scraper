            "answer_text": "The economy collapsed. It took several hundred years for the European economy to achieve a similar level of complexity and diversity. In the short run this meant returning to a barter economy with no single currency accepted everywhere. That is, a Roman solidus was the same in Egypt as it was in Londinium; no one had to exchange it. (Value is always lost in currency exchanges.) A Roman governor in Aquitania could appeal to neighboring governors or to the Senate for help. Barbarian kings were at each other\u2019s throats (including their own family members). The Roman economy was strong enough to finance extensive public roads, aqueducts, fountains, sewage systems, and a standing army. The first European nation to afford a standing army was England after her civil war (more than a thousand years after the collapse of the Western empire). It was illegal to torture citizen suspects to get a confession in Roman law. The torture of suspects was normal in the barbarian kingdoms. Romans didn\u2019t care what you believed, as long as you observed pro forma rules for honoring the Emperor. Catholics vigorously prosecuted heretics, and bishops replaced the secular Roman magistrates. Kinship lines also changed. ",

            "answer_text": "I assume you refer to the end of the Western part of Roman empire. It was not a fall because the king Odoacer simply sent back to Constantinople, to the legittimate emperor Zeno, the imperial insigna of the last usurper, Romulus Augustus. The Roman Empire fell almost 1000 years later when the last emperor Constantinus XI died while defending Constantinople from Turks. By that time only north of Gaul, East part of Retia and Illiria were still under Roman power. In Gaul we had Franks and Visigoths, the latter occupied also Spain, Suebi were in Lusitania. Alamans and Burgunds in East Gaul and part of Retia. Vandals in Africa, Sardinia, Corsica and Sicily; Herulans, Rugians and Scirians in Italy. Net, the day after September 4 476, when Romulus was deposed, nothing changed because everything has already changed in the 80 years before. The major change on the Mediterranean were the raids conducted by Vandals once the occupied Carthage and took possession of its fleet. All the coasts of Mediterranean were plundered, West and East Romans tried several time to recover Africa with no result until the Eastern emperor Justinian succeeded with his great general Belisarius.
