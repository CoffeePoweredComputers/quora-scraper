            "answer_text": "As of January 11, 2020, we now have our answer.  TFW you win an election with more votes than any other candidate in history only a year after getting destroyed in a previous election Tsai Ing-wen was a broken president after her \u201cDemocratic\u201d \u201cProgressive\u201d Party, which has ruled Taiwan since 2016, was smothered in the local elections of November 24, 2018. Out of the 22 counties and cities up for election, the DPP only won six (down from 13 in 2014), whereas the opposition Kuomintang won 15 (up from six in 2014). To make matters worse, the KMT won by a landslide in Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan that had long been considered DPP territory (think Utah or Tennessee for Republicans). The KMT candidate who won the mayoral race in Kaohsiung became the most popular politician in Taiwan. And in Taipei, where Tsai lives, the mayoral election ended with the DPP\u2019s candidate winning only 17 percent of the vote.  Results of the 2018 Taiwanese local elections. Blue = KMT, Green= DPP It was humiliating, and Tsai knew it. Before the election, her administration had already pissed off most people by being totally incompetent. Her approval rating sunk not so long after she took office, and it didn\u2019t get better. In line with tradition, Tsai stepped down as leader of her party, handing over her position to a nobody. She could run for a second presidential term starting in 2020, but no one thought she could win as she was polling lower than almost every possible candidate who could challenge her in the next election. Some advised Tsai not to run again, as she would lose and become the first one-term president in Taiwan\u2019s history (I once joked that Tsai was asking for international support to fight mainland China because she ran out of supporters at home). If that wasn\u2019t humiliating enough, William Lai Ching-te, Tsai\u2019s former premier, threw his hat into the ring, becoming the first person from an incumbent president\u2019s party to challenge the incumbent president. Tsai ran for reelection anyway, announcing her candidacy not to the public out in the public (as politicians usually do), but on a plane to a reporter from CNN.  Just as Tsai\u2019s fortunes could get any worse\u2026the KMT started discussing who they should run against Tsai in the next presidential election. Han Kuo-yu, the KMT\u2019s candidate who had won in Kaohsiung and gained a fanatical following not only in Kaohsiung but across Taiwan as well, was pressured by his fanbase and the party to run for president. Han had just taken office as mayor of Kaohsiung, and running for president and potentially winning another election by a landslide would effectively mean abandoning the people who had voted for him and leaving the city with another \u201crunaway mayor\u201d (previously, it was a DPP mayor who ditched Kaohsiung to serve in Tsai\u2019s administration). But Han decided to run for president, a decision that blew away much of the support that had helped him win in Kaohsiung. His approval rating began to drop, while Tsai\u2019s started to increase.  Han Kuo-yu Then someone else entered the KMT presidential primary: Terry Gou, the CEO of Foxconn, who wasn\u2019t even an active KMT party member but enjoyed some degree of grassroots support, especially from people who didn\u2019t traditionally support the KMT. And those who thought Han is better off staying in Kaohsiung because he had just been elected. The KMT became split between Han\u2019s fanatical supporters, Gou\u2019s fanatical supporters, and people who were put off by both candidates because of their background. The party ultimately nominated Han, but Gou took off on his own and started rubbing shoulders with politicians outside of the KMT, taking his own fanbase with him. The KMT\u2019s popularity decreased, Han\u2019s popularity decreased, while Tsai\u2019s popularity continued to increase.  Terry Gou (right) Then the protests in Hong Kong broke out. It all began with a man from Hong Kong murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan before fleeing back to Hong Kong, and Taiwan wanting him back but not getting him back because of the lack of an extradition agreement. So Hong Kong introduced a law that would allow extradition to places with which it doesn\u2019t have an extradition agreement, which also happened to include mainland China and sparked protests that dragged on until they became violent. Unsurprisingly, the unrest was branded by the West as an uprising against China, while Tsai, whose party is against all things China, seized the opportunity to claim that the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy was not working in Hong Kong and thus wouldn\u2019t work in Taiwan either, painting herself as a defender of \u201cTaiwan\u2019s sovereignty,\u201d freedom, and democracy and her opponents as Chinese puppets. At that point, the election turned from a simple popularity contest to a race to see who is more anti-China, which Tsai is naturally better at. Tsai\u2019s popularity kept going up; soon, she overtook Han and every other potential candidate in the polls.  Opinion polling for the 2020 Taiwanese general election - Wikipedia Then James Soong, a veteran politician who formerly belonged in the KMT but went on to form his own party, popped out of nowhere and entered the race. He didn\u2019t take many of Han\u2019s votes, but he was able to take some by default. And he had the backing of Terry Gou and some of his fans. Tsai\u2019s popularity reached its peak.  James Soong On January 11, 13 months and 18 days after Tsai\u2019s DPP was slaughtered in the local elections, the people of Taiwan went to the polls again to elect their next president and parliament. Also eligible to vote were 1.18 million first-time voters who were born during the 1990s, when government-sponsored \u201cTaiwanization\u201d (desinicization) began, and raised in an environment to think of themselves as Taiwanese, not Chinese. It was a sunny day. The votes were counted.  Tsai won over 8.1 million votes, more than any other presidential candidate in Taiwanese history. Her vote share is 57%, compared to 56% when she was first elected by a landslide in 2016. The DPP retained its majority in parliament, though it lost a few seats. Han, who was the most popular politician in Taiwan about a year ago, trailed by over 2 million votes. It wasn\u2019t even close. Laugh or cry, but this will go down as one of the top 10 anime turnarounds in political history.  *airhorn sound effect* ",

            "answer_text": "@Jamin Chen had a great drama to tell. But I have a better one to tell. At least she was in scene. Our hero was a total backbencher ! We didn't even think he existed. Ladies and Gentlemen, Presenting you our Hero of the story !  Oops , not a clear photo, I'll post a better one.  Looks bit amusing, but Better na ! Don't get carried by his sheepish smile, he is the shrewdest politicians I know now. He will even give Amit Shah (Will post this man's CV, he can we make a dysfunctional man get elected to any democratic office) a run for his money ! So where was he what was he doing ? He was a basically an old horse who everyone thought will just retire as a normal politician with just a ministry level experience. No one in the TamilNadu, India thought people will even try to pronounce his name badly. He is from Edappadi, a Taluk or county in our state. He was a farmer who made Jaggery (brown sugar cakes) in his hometown and joined ADMK( a state level party). He rose through ranks and was party loyalist. But he was a popular face or a crowd puller. Most of India or even his own state didn't know he was a Minister until he was appointed as a Chief Minister just by chance ! But there was only on thing that worked in his favor and it was Caste ! (The very same thing TN people brag about being eliminated) Him getting nominated itself was a crazy story. From the year 2011, TamilNadu was facing state elections. This time nothing new happened. Our state has the habit of switching parties in the top and ADMK came to power. What you see in the first picture, is the cabinet of that administration which took charge after winning elections. He was Minister of Highways and Minor Ports at that time.  Jayalalithaa was the CM at that time. And her administration was quite decent, so people also elected her again for next elections in 2016. So where is the rise of our Hero. Not until her death in the same year on 5th Dec. She was autocratic in nature and she didn't even develop a system of hierarchical leadership. People even expected her party to be doomed. As there was no hierarchy or even a proper leadership. Another vicious lady who was her close friend entered the Arena.  Oh boy, she looks like a devil, doesn't she. She installed, the puppet of her old friend Jaya named O Pannerselvam. Below is the video of taking Oath.  But our devil was not patient, she wanted power quickly, and our Loyalist is a loyalist of her dead friend and the party, never the loyalist of her. She was getting tired of it, so she forced him out soon. AIADMK\u2009urges Sasikala to \u2018immediately\u2019 take charge as Tamil Nadu CM And the drama started, she was getting lot of opposition and people also hated her getting the Throne. And she also threw Pannerselvam out who forms a separate camp. But he didn't have the money to finance his camp and is looking for support. And suddenly Jaya's old corruption case was reopened and both Devil and her friend were convicted. This forced her to go into Prison and she named our Hero to the post. And now our Hero starts the game. Our Hero kicks out the Devil and her family out of the party. The Devil's family now form a separate party called AMMK. Meanwhile the Pannerselvam camp running out of funds and steam is looking back to tap into his crowd.  But he lacks the infrastructure and now way our OPS(guy in center) can take on our heros faction who has the numbers and money. So he decides to go back to his party but our Shrewd hero gives him an Ultimatum. Join as a deputy to him, on fear of going irrelevant, OPS joins the party along with his camp and is given Deputy CM post. AIADMK merger: How Panneerselvam, Palaniswami factions struck deal to keep Sasikala out Thus our Hero even today is continuing to hold the the CM Throne.  He also strengthened his hold well. He put many main ministers from his caste and hold a strong sway in the Western TN. He has polished his speaking skills and his oratory is listenable when compared to the opposition leader who is famed for his rolling tongue[He once said wall on the Cat instead of cat on the wall]. Another Bonus pic  Our hero looks smart, doesn't he ? The answer is not complete yet, I still need to edit to make the answer much interesting. ",
