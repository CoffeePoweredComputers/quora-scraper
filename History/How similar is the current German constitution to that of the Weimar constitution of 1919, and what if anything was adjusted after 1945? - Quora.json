            "answer_text": "In brief, the primary difference is that the new German constitution formally enshrines a fundamental commitment to human dignity. This is unprecedented language. It writes, \u201cHuman dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority.\u201d This sentiment is heavily influenced by Kantian philosophy, in which respect for others\u2019 dignity is the basis for moral duty. Kant is one of Germany\u2019s most championed and notable philosophers, which is why the German constitution, in its revision, reflects many of Kant\u2019s ideals. One interesting ramification of its emphasis on human dignity is that Germany has one of the most humane criminal justice systems, in terms of its conditions of confinement for prisoners and sentencing. Unlike prisons in the US, which often deprive its criminals of basic human rights, such as sanitary living conditions, Germany is at the forefront of rehabilitative criminal justice, providing prisoners with their own room, smoking-breaks, the ability to wear their own clothes, etc. This is due in large part to Germany\u2019s constitutional respect for human dignity. Here is a link to a series of articles on Germany\u2019s criminal justice system: How Germany Does Prison ",

            "answer_text": "Some notable differences are: Individual rights being put in first place, human dignity being the most basic value of the constitutional order.Article 1 (1) Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority. (2) The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world. (3) The following basic rights shall bind the legislature, the executive and the judiciary as directly applicable law. This makes breaches of the basic rights (articles 1\u201319) directly illegal. The basic rights are not at the disposal of a majority in parliament. The former, enforced by a strong and independent Constitutional Court, available to everyone claiming that legislation and acts of the executive violate their individual rights.No wide ranging emergency powers for the president, which were instrumental in securing Hitler\u2019s grip on power.The parliamentary vote of no confidence can only be a Constructive vote of no confidence i.e. the government cannot be toppled by a coalition of parties that only agree who they do not want as Chancellor but cannot agree on whom they do want.Measures to forestall the military becoming a State within a state - strong parliamentary control of the military; the military may not be used for purposes of internal security.",
