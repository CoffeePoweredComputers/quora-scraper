            "answer_text": "This is a very controversial issue and some authoritative historians like Robert Paxton carried out a lot of research to provide a balanced view. My answer is just a reminder of what is generally admitted as true I have no privileged source of information; PETAIN WAS THE LEGITIMATE LEADER OF FRANCE when he signed in June 1940 an armistice with Hitler. He was not a stooge of the Germans, like Quisling in Norway, he was a fascist (a friend of Franco) also an antisemite (but Roosvelt, Churchill and de Gaulle have never protested publicly against the extermination of Jews !) he depised however Hitler, like many professional soldiers did. The WHOLE FRENCH ADMINISTRATION SWORE FIDELITY TO PETAIN : all the 90 Pr\u00e9fets (with the sole exception of Jean Moulin) all the judges (including those who condemned after the war P\u00e9tain) the police (that rounded up the Jews and put them in the Veld\u2019hiv sports arena). Indeed the Paris police revolted against the German occupiers only when the Allies were reported nearing the capital\u2026 INTIAL \u201cRESISTANCE\u201d JUNE 1940 - JUNE 1941. Until the agression of the USSR by Hitler the Communist Party felt that the Molotov-Ribbentrop treaty implied solidarity with the the Soviets and did not authorize any action against the Germans. A number of red interlectuals started printing pamphlets (often refugees from the Spanish civil war, Poles, Jews). The reaction of the occupiers was extremely violent : 148 mainly Communists were executed ! AFTER JUNE 1941 : THE COMMUNIST PARTY ORGANIZED THE RESISTANCE; However since the Party was persecuted a large number of separate groups were concerned. A first terrorist act had consisted in murdering a random German officer in a suburb of Nantes ( Chateaubriant): immediately 48 hostages were executed. However this was a turning point : the Communists stopped such agressions and the Germans realized that it was better to let the French authorities deal with the population as they did not want to tie down too many occupation troops. So there were many pamphlets printed, false identity cards issued, some Jews hidden\u2026and intense competition amongst the \u201cresistance groups\u201d in order to be recognized by London and to get arms and cash AFTER APRIL 1942 the collaboration was personified by PIERRE LAVAL. When P\u00e9tain tried to get rid of him, the German authorities forced him to name Laval to the job of Prime Minister in charge of the Ministries located in Paris. P\u00e9tain at the time wasn\u2019t even allowed to visit his capital ! The Laval regime started by instituting the STO Service de Travail Obligatoire\u2026meaning the compulsory manning of German factories by French workers\u2026and this resulted in the wholesale fleeing of young men in the MAQUIS (hard to reach areas in the mountains) Most French were politically FENCE-SITTING, their hostility increasing as Germany after the winter of 1943 seemed to be losing the war. However the most important preoccupation of the population was the decreasing amount of food that the ration cards allowed to purchase\u2026Random agressions of German soldiers was mainly carried out by the MANUCHIAN GROUP, a desperate organisation of immigrants of Eastern Jewish communist origin fighting without the support of the Party. They ended up being caught and executed. Some actual sabotage acts were carried out by Communist railroad workers, unfastening railroad tracks and sometimes blowing up trains\u2026but this had only LIMITED EFFECTIVENESS in slowing down the movement of German troops. The fight against the numerous resistance movements (that numbered many leaders and few troops) was carried out by the MILICE (Axis friendly French paramilitary) \u2026and so very few German troops were needed to occupy France.  However once the Allies had liberated most of France, suddenly the number of \u201cresistance fighters\u201d multiplied considerably. When at the end of the war de Gaulle reviewed those irregular forces, made up almost exclusively of high ranking officers, he is said to have stopped in front of one of the rare non decorated \u201cheroes\u201d and is reported to have asked : \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with you ? Can\u2019t you sew ? \u201c  ",

            "answer_text": "I can't answer the last part of that question because I honestly haven't looked into it. The first part I think I can. The French resistance were an outstanding resource for the Allies. Not in terms of combat, or overall casualties and damage caused to the German forces, although in a short window (operation Overlord) it could be argued they where the most devastating and effective combat unit the allies possessed. It comes to what the resistance was for, and how the allies used it. Forthis I will not be talking about Paris, as that was in my view an uprising and a separate topic. The Resistance provided the Allies with three incalculable services. 1 intelligence gathering. No one can gather Intel like a local. Many times German attempts to deceive allied observation Aircraft would be countered by resistance intelligence reports. Such a thing happened in Normandy, an SS (I think) panzer unit was hiding in woodland, but they had chosen to \u201cdouble bluff\u201d the allies, they hid their tanks but not their track marks, while a few miles away an engineer unit had driven over a few fields by another patch of woodland and then attempted to \u201chide\u201d the track marks. The allies thought this is where the unit was hidden and proceeded to bomb it, shell it etc but couldnt see any wrecks and thought the Germans were still there. Only when French Resistance units pointed out where they really were did the Allies switch targets. 2. Recovery of aircrew. The French repatriated hundreds of downed airmen, this was especially vital in the Battle of Britain period, the Germans never had such a resource. 3. Embedding SOE agents and special forces. The Resistance where exellent at helping agents and special forces get in country and close to target/s. They could also help with evacuation when needed. 4. Direct action. The blowing up of railways, phone lines, bridges, laying road markings for allied forces to use, mining German roads etc. All of these things in a very quick time frame distracted, disoriented and slowed the German response.
