            "answer_text": "First let us understand what a society is. A society is a group of people residing in a particular area having a same thought process. There are various kinds of societies, for example, Indian society where there are various cultural groups; where each cultural group follow their own tradition but each and every cultural group is again tied to each other with a fine thread of respect, a feeling of secularism and so on. In the same way there are societies like American society where they follow a same kind of culture throughout the country. There is diversity in their culture even but very less. India has much more diversity in their culture so naturally it is a different society from the American society. Now if we look towards the tribal society, they are much more attached with the nature. Their culture and tradition all are linked with the nature. Each and every tribal society is different from each other. The Munda of Indian tribal society is different from the Blackfeet American tribal society. Now let me classify how sociologists classified society: Hunting and gathering society.Pastoral societyHorticulture societyAgricultural society.Industrial societyPost- industrial society.All the developing and developed countries are mainly based on agricultural pattern, industrial pattern of society. And few parts of these countries are dominated by the hunting and gathering pattern of society. ",

            "answer_text": "The mass media, especially the newspapers during the Gilded Age (after the Civil War until about 1896) propagated the idea of social stratification, dividing the nation into several \u201csocieties\u201d based on economic inequality and exaggerating the differences between them in what was called \u201cYellow Journalism[1].\u201d Basically ordered from poorest to richest, terms like paupers, peasants, laborers, tradesmen, professionals, management, business owners, vassals, landlords, sovereigns. Mostly they were called \u201chigh society\u201d and \u201clow society\u201d this would fool the Middle Class into believing it was slightly better than the destitute, thereby convincing them they could settle down in the muck. Eventually a form of journalism called Muckraking[2] would start exposing this fraud. Footnotes[1] Yellow journalism - Wikipedia[2] Muckraker - Wikipedia",
