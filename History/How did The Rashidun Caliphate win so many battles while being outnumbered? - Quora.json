            "answer_text": "The Arabs of the Rashidun Caliphate invaded two empires exhausted by decades of war but still capable of fielding huge armies just not as qualitative and competent as before since both empires lost many of their best generals during the course of the conflict as well as many of their veterans. It should be noted however that the initial goal of the earliest Muslim conquest was rather an attempt to unify the ethnic Arabs in the fringes of the Roman and Persian empires and bring them to their new religion of Islam instead of outright conquering these empires or rather reducing them to a mere midget as the situations changed. But whatever the situation, the Arabs still won their battles done in the name of the earliest known jihad in history. Despite its home region being a desert it being ideal to horseback or camelback armies, the Rashidun armies were actually mostly infantry with only the small yet elite Mobile Guard being their true cavalry force. It is actually misleading to believe that the Arabs mostly relied on cavalry to defeat larger armies while in reality it was otherwise the case; this is stemmed from the fact that the Arabs came from the desert and from the statement abovementioned.  A Rashidun footman, the mainstay of the early Muslim armies.  The different branches of the Rashidun infantry arm. The cavalry arm in the Rashidun army was actually proportionately very small, and were mostly limited to the Mobile Guard elite led personally by army generals themselves, including Khalid bin Walid. These were mainly used as follow-up battering rams at the event that victory for them is assured, and for them to keep the status quo of the battle in their favor should it go badly by charging and countercharging. Compared to the cataphracts of the Roman and Persian armies, the Rashidun Mobile Guard cavalry was outnumbered and rather lightly armed and armored but this is more than compensated by their greater mobility and agility; they were the army\u2019s elite shock unit. Other regular cavalry units in the Rashidun army were smaller in size still, but same to their Mobile Guard they were as well mobile and agile although nowhere near as elite as them; they were used for scouting ahead of enemies before a battle is joined. While they do have a number of horses and camels in the army, most of these were limited to troop and supply transport purposes in the same lime as the army lorries today. To prove this, we have Alexander the Great who marched his footmen-majority Greek armies from western Anatolia to Mesopotamia via Egypt in three years from 334 to 331 BC. The Arabs of Khalid bin Walid marched from Mesopotamia to Palestine via Syria also in three years from 633 to 636 AD; however, some books were sourced that the earliest instance they entered Persian Mesopotamia was in 629, which might make the timespan into 7 years. If the Rashidun army was a cavalry-majority army they would have completed the campaign in less than a year or so, but being an infantry-majority force it was not to be.  Alexander the Great\u2019s march in red, Khalid bin Walid\u2019s march in green, all in the same span of time. Notice how short bin Walid\u2019s march was compared to Alexander\u2019s despite the same span of time performed. The Rashidun armies started their campaign with nothing to spare other than blunt swords, small circular wicker shields and Arab robes. Only when they defeated Persian border patrols in what is now Iraq did they acquire some armor in the form of metal plates and chainmails and some decent weaponry in the form of better quality swords and spears, but this is mostly only reserved for the elites in the army. In raw thinking, having little or no armor meant suicide while fighting against a heavily armed and armored, let alone numerous, foe, but having such has its stipends. The Arabs having little or no armor to don can march more quickly and fight more agilely and can move in or out to different sectors rapidly at will; even on foot they still did the same. This rapidity is why the Persians failed to respond on time and as a result only within a few months Mesopotamia fell quickly to them. It is also the reason why the Romans lost at Yarmuk, although the reason there lies more on the incompetence of their commanders rather than their battlefield performance. Their religious fanaticism to their Allah, which caused the jihad in the first place, only motivated them to fight more fiercely. In sharp contrast to the earlier unification campaigns of the Caliphate across the Arabian Peninsula where units were based per tribe i.e. tribal contingents, reforms were made in the army so that it is based on units of 100 for a company, 1000 for a battallion, 4000 for a division, and 10,000 or more for an army composed of men from all over the Arabian Peninsula \u2014 and later conquered peoples joining their side \u2014 with zero regards to tribal connections. Unifying them all is their indoctrination by the Caliph and other imams to the will of their Allah and to Islam, stressing out that it was their objective to unify the world in front of them under the Islamic faith and the will of the late Prophet Muhammad. There was no formal training for the men in the army, they joined simply because they were either called by the higher religious authorities to join the jihad or voluntarily joined it out of the want to search for new trading posts for their desert caravans. Training is limited to duels between individuals, and battle formations were ordered only by their commanders on the spot as they were told. Battlefield tactics of the Rashidun armies under Khalid bin Walid are refined to perfection. At Yarmuk, bin Walid formed his infantry, the vast majority of his army, into a very tight schiltron/phalanx formation called the tabi\u2019a to compensate for them being lightly armored to counter the more heavily armed and armoured Roman legions and their vassals. In that way, with the Arabs tightly packed together with some on the front sitting or laying prone while those in the back standing with their swords and spears erect outward, they can pick on and kill Roman legionnaires one by one as their rigid formations rather only permit one line of infantry at a time. While bin Walid was not in command of another army stationed in Iraq, the Arabs did the same thing on Qadisiyah against the Persians and won.  The Arab tabi\u2019a formation used during the Battle of Yarmuk in 636 AD. Also, they have a subterfuge tactic to demoralize their enemies. In the eve of battle, while the bulk of their army was already present on the battlefield, some parts of their army came in bands of hundreds as a continuous stream of reinforcements, giving the impression to their enemies that they have a larger force coming to them while they still always possess numerical advantage. It worked in a few major battles. The effect of champion vs champion duels during several battles that the Muslims initiated could never be understated. This is where the Mobarizun, the gladiators of the Rashidun army of which the commander Khalid bin Walid is one among other commanders, comes in. They were trained on how to deal with enemy champions and commanders by fighting them efficiently in close quarters combat, with their fighting skills using the sword honed to near perfection. It was said that bin Walid had 6 of his swords broken for fighting enemy commanders and killing them one by one in a battle that left the now leaderless enemy severely demoralized before the battle proper even started. Although there may have been seldom champion duels that occured during the hundred years-long conflict between Rome and Persia, such duels on a greater frequency have only occured during the early Muslim conquests and fights akin to Hector vs Achilles or David vs Goliath (but with \u2018David\u2019 holding a sword instead of a sling) became commonplace throughout the campaigns, with considerable consequences to each side in terms of morale. The campaigns of the Rashidun Caliphate were basically one of the earliest forms of blitzkrieg in history, in that combined-arms units, cavalry and infantry, worked together to achieve a campaign goal while marching rapidly. They were just way too fast for their enemies to be dealt with. The vast and massive but more cumbersome armies of Rome and Persia failed to timely respond to the threat, and were rather frustratingly sluggish as they do that. More so, the Arabs quickly adapt to whatever changes occur on the battlefield as demonstrated in Yarmuk and Qadisiyah. ",
