            "answer_text": "Okay but i have issues with the other Answers  A. Not supporting the American Revolution. It was a plan of the French War Party which hated Britain and did not care at all for the American colonists and it was a colossal mistake. Whether the colonists had a moral right i can not answer but was it fair the French poor had to pay more taxes because the American settlers refused to pay their taxes.  Czarina Catherine II the Great B. It would have been an excellent opportunity to bring Russia into the Coalition France-Austria as Czarina Catherine the Great HATED the American Revolution while Empress Maria Theresa, his mother-in-law had warned Louis XVI not to support the colonists.  Empress-Dowager Maria Theresa, Queen of Hungary, Bohemia etc. C. Try to avoid the endless wars with Britain as they were far too costly. If not there was a formidable Coalition against the British. Still better, keeping out of Wars altogether as the Wars and the famines it caused had been the bane of Louis XIV and Louis XV. D. The French Protestants had got tolerance in an Edict of 1787 BEFORE the Revolution, the Protestants in Alsace-Lorraine always had near equal rights and the Jews in these French \u201cGerman Lands\u201dalready had some rights too. Try to expand this, imitating Austria under Emperor Joseph II, the brother-in-law.  Emperor Joseph II. He hated ostentation and was a radical reformer. E. The King had already proposed taxation of nobles and clergy and even had the support of his brother , the Count of Provence, on this.  Louis, Count of Provence, highly intellectual, later King Louis XVIII G. More representation of the commoners would be an excellent idea but avoiding the \u201cEtats Generaux\u201d. Maybe some kind of decentralization by commoners, not the nobles. H. The socalled \u201cParlements\u201d, a kind of Courts should never have been recalled. I. Curtailing the rights of the nobility. Following the solution of more progressive countries..  Versailles J. Trying to ease down on the money spent on Planet Versailles. Make it less costly by setting a financial expert on it. More efficiency would have helped. Much of the costs were NOT caused by the individual spending of the royals but by keeping this curious construct floating. And if not possible -sigh- relocate to Paris but not the dreadful Tuileries.  Tuileries, circa 1860 K, A complete overhaul of taxation. Was actually tried but failed.  Bastille 1715 L. Arbitrary arrests were already a thing of the past. M. Trying to keep the prices of bread fixed . The plan of Louis XV was excellent but kept the grain merchants in power, like foxes guarding a hen house. N. Ending what was left of serfdom, imitating Austria and Prussia. There were hardly any serfs left but it was bad for France\u2019s reputation as an Enlightened Monarchy. Much of this was already told by the French author Andre Maurois long ago, before World War TWO>  Andre Maurois Was it really good to imitate Britain. Imitating other Enlightened Monarchies, which were more progressive, would also have been a step in the right direction. The Grandduchy of Tuscany under Archduke Leopold, the Austrian lands under Emperor Joseph II and even crazy Prussia under King Frederick II.  Archduke Leopold, first Grandduke of Tuscany, later Emperor Leopold II, reformer And i forgot: keeping an eye on Prussia for except Britain few countries hated France more than Prussia under Frederick II! Louis once mentioned to Count Fersen that he should have acted after the Bastille. Sick the French Army on the culprits who thought to get away with murder. Sending the Queen with her children to Vienna would also have been a good idea. As Austria was France\u2019s most trusted Ally. ",

            "answer_text": " The French Revolution is easily avoided with the benefit of hindsight, also known as history. King Louis XVI should have: Opened up direct lines of communication with all classes and regions, especially including the Third Estate (non-clerical commoners), and solicit any political help needed to pass reforms in the best interests of France.Accepted a constitutional monarchy similar to the one preserved to this day in Great Britain, with an elected parliament and an independent judiciary.Taxed the nobility and the clergy commensurate with their ability to pay. The power of the parlements (provincial courts of appeal) should have been reduced, as these blocked tax reform.Eliminated privileges enjoyed by the nobility, including but not limited to their exclusive hunting rights, and made all offices and positions open to all classes.Eliminated tithes and church taxes, required the Catholic Church to support itself, and granted Protestant, other Christian and Jewish religions freedom of worship and organization.Never gone into debt to finance the American Revolution or other wars (or re-structured French debt to permit more time to pay debt).Reduced the expenses of the royal court and French government and eliminated all ostentatious displays of wealth or fashion by his wife the queen and all of the nobility.Sold some royal and state-owned assets.Collected tax revenues directly rather than having tax farmers.Increased trade, commerce and income by becoming less mercantilist, less protectionist and less interventionist in France\u2019s economic laws and policies.Kept France out of wars until the stated reforms were accomplished.Ceased all arbitrary arrests and actions.Adopted something similar to Napoleon\u2019s Civil Code.",
