            "answer_text": "First, the word \u2018\u2019Casualty\u2019\u2019 means; person killed or injured in a war or accident. World War II gathered the richest harvest of human life in the history of the world. In total, it is said that 72,468,900 people died However Estimating the number of deaths caused by war or other violent conflicts is controversial. Different historians present many different estimates of the number of victims of World War II . The authors of the book \"Oxford Companion to World War II\" maintain that \"estimates of the number of dead are notoriously unreliable\". Top 5 countries that lost most people are as follows: Soviet Union - 23,400,000: What is so shocking about the Soviet Union\u2019s deaths is that most of the 23 million casualties was caused by a single man \u2013 Joseph Stalin. The vicious leader killed many more people than Adolf Hitler, and is in fact, known as the biggest killer in history. It is estimated that he caused the death of 43 million people, although many of the deaths did not come during World War II. The rest of the death toll can be accounted for as Soviet Union soldiers who died in the terrible battles against Germany. The infamous Battle of Stalingrad alone killed almost 2 million people. China - 20,000,000: The Nanking Massacre was a genocide Japan committed in the former Chinese capital of Nanjing (Nanking). During a six-week period, the Japanese military killed thousands and thousands of unarmed civilians, and tortured up to 80,000 more in a vile manner. Additionally, General Yasuji Okamura implemented his Three Alls Policy (Kill All, Burn All, Loot All) was responsible for around 3 million deaths in of itself. Due to the Japanese, 80% of Chinese who died during World War II were civilians. The way Japan slaughtered innocent Chinese is what caused tension between Japan and the rest of the world for many years, whether fair or unfair. Germany - 8,680,000: A great deal of the deaths came from the military, as Hitler\u2019s aggressive tactics took a toll on those fighting. Over 300,000 German civilians were also killed by their own government, as they were deemed dangerous by the Nazis. A further 400,000 more were killed in aerial attacks by the Allies. It is estimated that 5.3 million deaths were military, and 3.3 were civilians. Poland - 5,820,000: Almost 22% of Poland\u2019s population was killed during World War II, and 3 million of the deaths were from Jews being killed in the Holocaust. It had the highest pre-war Jewish population in Europe. Almost 80% of Jews in German-occupied Europe were killed in the Holocaust. Numerous Polish citizens were also killed in the infamous blitzkriegs the Germans conducted. Poland was first invaded in September of 1939 and, despite their valiant effort, was outmatched and surrendered a month later. German forces reportedly lined up Polish citizens and shot them dead, with execution sites found with bodies numbering up to 20,000. When Poland was liberated in 1944, 90% of the deaths the country suffered was from civilians. Dutch East Indies - 4,000,000: When Japan attacked Indonesia in late 1941 and early 1942, the Royal Dutch East Indies Army was vastly outnumbered, and quickly lost. All able-bodied Europeans in the country were taken as Prisoners of War (POWs), and around 25% did not survive their imprisonment. The UN later estimated that 4 million Indonesians died from starvation and forced labor. The allied forces tried to assist, but were crushed by the Japanese in the Battles of Java Sea, Sunda Strait, and Second Java Sea. However, the Japanese did stop Dutch rule, and encouraged the independence movement. In 1949, Indonesia officially became a country.

            "answer_text": "That is a matter of great debate Estimates vary from nation to nation, not all nations use the same criteria, or the same terminology. Additionally, many records are missing, or, are incomplete, and many overlap other figures. Some estimates include deaths from forced population transfers following the war From what I have read, the death toll could be as high as 80 million. This number takes into consideration the following: Military Deaths -Combat related -Prisoners of war -Those that died of disease Civilian Deaths -Combat related -Holocaust Victims -Those that died from war related famine and disease -Those that died during forced population transfers following the war. The Civilian death toll exceeded total military deaths. In most cases, the suffering of civilian populations under German or Japanese occupation cannot be over stated, particularly in Eastern Europe, Russia and in the Pacific Theater. -100K Allied Airmen died during the bombing campaign of Germany -45K Allied Merchant Seaman died in the battle of the Atlantic -Over 18K Soviets (Russians) died every day they were in the war from 6/41 - 5/45 -Poland lost 17% of it\u2019s population, Russia 14%, Greece and Yugoslavia 10% -3.5 Million Russian Prisoners of war died in captivity -The Netherlands was the worst country to be Jewish, over 90% of Dutch Jews died during the war. -German deaths stood at around 7 million, about 8% of the population -Japanese deaths stood at around 2.75 million, about 4% of the population -Deaths from forced post war population transfers, that included violence, disease, and suicide numbered around two million. -At least 1.5 million German Women were raped during the closing months of the war, and in the first years of occupation. -Estimates vary, on Roma (Gypsy) deaths, but 200K seems highly probable. -200k Women from countries occupied by Japan were forced into military brothels, These \u201cComfort Women\u201d were one of the great tragedies the war. -large numbers of ordinary dissidents, homosexual\u2019s, opinionated clergy and others perished in German Prisons and Concentration Camps. -85% of German U-Boat crews died during the war -80% of soviet males born in 1923 did not survive the war Appeasement, which is the greatest of all evils caused this awful war, in the end appeasement always costs more lives. The world wastes it\u2019s time on fruitless negotiations, and sanctions, which do nothing but provide time for a rogue nation to get stronger, braver, and it serves to only emboldens them, and the longer it goes on the harder it becomes to deal with them. At some point, it becomes intolerable, and by that time the death toll will be much higher than if we had acted in the first place. ",
