            "answer_text": "The Maritime Museum of San Diego has recently completed a replica of Juan Rodriguez de Cabrillo's ship, the San Salvador.  This as the first European vessel to land in California, entering San Diego Bay in 1542. The sails have just been rigged, so we'll find out how she does within a few months.  Most people suspect that the added weight of modern safety gear (lots of ballast for stability) and the two diesel engines will slow her down a lot. San Salvador Replica My guess is that the Spanish galleons of a century later might have done 5-6 nudos (knots) on a good day; maybe a couple more in ideal conditions with a strong wind from astern.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve done a lot of research with ship\u2019s logbooks from the 18th and 19th centuries, and most of those ships (East Indiamen primarily) averaged 8\u20139 knots over a voyage of about 14,000 miles, much of which was spent in the trade winds. Over a region of variable winds, slightly slower average speeds might be expected. Galleons also would have been slowed down 1\u20132 knots by their width and broad bows. If we\u2019re talking about the famous Manila galleons, speed was gained by the Pacific counter-currents, but ship configuration might reduce potential speed. As a result, a 17th century galleon might sail 7 knots per hour, 168 nautical miles a day, and 1,176 nautical miles a week. ",
