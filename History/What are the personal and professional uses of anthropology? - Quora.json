            "answer_text": "The most general answer is that anthropologists are called to ask and answer questions about human life and human variation, but that doesn't really mean much unless it is broken down further. Classically, anthropology is broken down into four fields (you might hear of anthropology schools that pride themselves in offering all four fields), which offer different forms of expertise. These four fields are related, but in a general sense concern themselves with different aspects of human existence (language, human body/evolution, material culture, and social organization). The following examples are mere snapshots of the many possible jobs for which anthropologists are uniquely suited. Linguistic Anthropology concerns itself with human language- how it serves as a tool for thought and social action in the world. These anthropologists find themselves studying and documenting different languages in the world both to discover interesting insights about language in general but also to do more practical work preserving or promoting languages that find themselves threatened by those that see those languages and/or people that speak them as defunct in some kind of way. These kinds of conflicts can be seen domestically in attacks on different vernacular forms of English (popular called \"ebonics\") or internationally in the form of inclusion or exclusion of certain dialects or languages from national education movements. Physical Anthropology concerns itself in human variation in the form of physical body developments. These anthropologists study how different bones grow and how these patterns are influenced by the environment. Again, human variation is an important phenomenon that anthropologists seek to understand. This field has been popularized on the show Bones, in which the anthropologist detective investigates the bones of victims and is able to tell certain things about their life histories, such as a traumatic events, diet, and life-style. Physical anthropologists are particularly suited to investigate public health issues, which often involve what is a referred to as a \"mismatch\" between evolutionary developments in the human body and the contemporary environment. For example, Physical Anthropologists generate a lot of the public health understandings about the rise and spread of Type II diabetes, cancer, and asthma around the world. Physical Anthropologists also find purchase lending their expertise to those interested in human development from birth, providing recommendations or insights into pregnancy and child raising. Archeology concerns itself with material culture- the things humans make and use. These anthropologists can offer insights into the lives of those that are no longer around through the artifacts that have been left behind. They have been essential to understanding the lives of those in ancient civilizations, like those in Egypt and the Americas. Indiana Jones is a popularized version of an archeologist, representing the romanticized search for, and theft of, ancient artifacts. Archeologists have also concerned themselves with applying their insights into today's cultures, treating trash dumps, for example, as modern day archeological sites.  Finally, Socio/Cultural Anthropology concerns itself with patterns of human social behavior- how groups of people organize themselves, understand themselves and the world around them, and act according to and in spite of those organizations and understandings. These are the anthropologists of yore that went to some remote tribe for a year at a time and then returned home to write the definitive account of that people and their way of life. In general, these anthropologists focus on creating accounts of variations in human experiences of the world, lending them a vast amount of material since there are a countless number of such variations. Other than researching and teaching in the university setting, these anthropologists find themselves called to be expert witnesses in courts to testify about the importance of certain kinds of rituals, or the validity of a group's claim that it constitutes a Native American tribe, for example. They might also take on more political roles, advocating for some group that finds itself disenfranchised in some way by documenting and disseminating information about that disenfranchisement. They work as policy analysts, applying their methods to analyze how different kinds of policies are enacted on the ground, sometimes in ways that contradict their original intentions. They work in various professional fields as cultural liaisons, helping to communicate between some kind of professional service organization and the different culture for which they hope to provide a service. This work occurs in medicine, where different people throughout the world have very different understandings of health, healing, and sickness than we do in the West. Some contentious work today also includes assisting the military through expertise about and communication with foreign communities, aiding the military in taking control of and managing those communities (though this role has been denounced by the American Anthropological Association). Finally, in the corporate world, anthropologists are utilized heavily in the marketing business, using their methods to discover the kinds of ad campaigns that appeal to different kinds of people. They also might analyze social behavior in stores to help develop more profitable layouts for businesses. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s basic for all human activities. You can use anthropology to learn about a community and help them achieve better food/health/education services. You can help psychologists and psychiatrists by providing key information about the social behaviour and values that move a determined population, so you can asess their health better. You can help bussiness men to get to know a society, its core values and needs to make better investments and prevent disaster, or see better opportunities by joining some communities with common interests. You can help lawyers to understand the real context in which they\u2019re making new laws and rules, so they can more effectively adress an issue, avoiding ambiguity or inappropiatness. You can help the philosopher and the artist to see their social context as a bigger construct and social game, instead of just abstract, universal, almost-obvious notions of the human nature/mind/consciusness. You can help politicians to make better messages so they can be understood by a bigger audience, to know better about the people they work for and what people really need. You can help biologist and enviromentalists by showing them how species interact with human societies in many different levels (economical/religious/historical) and how there are better ways to make animal welfare possible without damaging or going against human communities. You can help the military to know how their enemies organize, what they value so they can be more diplomatic or what their allies are after, in a bigger sociological/anthropologica picture. You can help religious people realize the history and ways of religion in many different places, what they all have in common and what they\u2019re all after, and what is to be made of religion today, if there\u2019s something to be changed or preserved. You can help TV Show producers to make better shows in terms of social welfare and education. Anthropology is essential for human living. Actually we all do anthropological activity without studying it. What we professionals study are many theoretical frameworks that some people have made in order to understand human nature/ways, and a lot of empirical research, so we can have a bigger perspective of what humanity is through its existence from the very beggining to the modern day, with the hope to develop some good hints or few insights on how things will be tomorrow based on the decisions we make today. I like to say that anthropology is like philosophy, but in a more historical-empirical way. Also, you can always use anthropology to enjoy the human creation and to be more forgiving of its wrongdoings. It inspires you a lot about your own potential and the potential of those around you. ",
