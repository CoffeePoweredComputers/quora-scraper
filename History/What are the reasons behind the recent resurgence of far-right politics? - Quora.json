Buckley\u2019s Sharon Statement in 1962 that created the Young Americans for Freedom that is the farm system of corporate crypto-Nazi apparatchik and alt-right storm troopers of the GOP Deep State that coalesced around Donald T. Regan until Nancy fired his ass, and just confirmed Kavanugh. This isn\u2019t brand new: you just required Trump\u2019s election for the scales to be removed from your eyes.   ",

            "answer_text": "All over the world we are seeing the effects of globalism which is amoral. It is not immoral but indifferent to suffering and lack of opportunity. In the new global economy some get fantastically wealthy but it is doing nothing for the vast majority. So people are doing what people do when they are angry and scared. They get nationalistic and right wing and blame things on immigrants and minorities and the stereotype \u2018other\u2019. It is really the fault of the new global economy and the fact that society has not caught up enough to know where to put the breaks and reorganize things. If we are not dead from global warming we will figure this out. ",
