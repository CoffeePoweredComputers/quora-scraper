            "answer_text": "Perhaps they were, perhaps they were not. Regardless, to say they were grateful would directly conflict with the overwhelming narrative of amazing white heroes that dominates our history textbooks. To admit that any white settler may have needed help from any non-white drops a large turd in the punch bowl of a social caste system based on race, wealth, ancestry, and fame. Sadly, some find it heretical to suggest anyone not fit their assigned stereotypes, and they lobbied hard to influence textbooks. ",
