            "answer_text": "I would hope that at least a good many of the children of this decade\u20142020\u20132030\u2014will have \u201cwholesome nostalgia and character-making memories\u201d despite the virus. First of all, I would hope that the virus won\u2019t extend for 10 years. Secondly, I feel that if children have good, loving parents, they can get through all kinds of things. When I\u2019m walking around, I see children walking with their parents. Both the parents and children have masks on, and I think about how the children seem to be fine. They\u2019re not pulling at their masks or complaining. Many children have had more time with their parents since the pandemic took hold. They may actually feel more loved and connected than before. I try to imagine what it would have been like to have had a pandemic when I was growing up. I can get a little claustrophobic thinking about being in quarantine with my parents, but I\u2019d like to think that they would have come to appreciate us more (I could always dream). It sure would have been nice if my father would have used his extra leisure time to talk with us and spend time with us. I hope for the children\u2019s sake that they have some positive memories of this time. They may regret some of the time lost, of course, but I would hope that they could look back on some good memories. It doesn\u2019t necessarily take a trip to Disneyworld to make a child happy. One of my happiest childhood memories is when my brothers and I would sit around my dad\u2019s big desk and help him with small tasks for his wholesale business. We felt so appreciated and useful. ",
