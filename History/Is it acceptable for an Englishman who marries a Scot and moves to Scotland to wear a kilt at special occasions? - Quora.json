            "answer_text": "In 1822 King George IV wore a kilt to a function in Edinburgh. At that time, a few Highlanders were still wearing full 12 yard woolen kilts. Here was an Englishman wearing a kilt similar to those worn be The Black Watch; a shorter kilt wrapped at the waist with a shoulder sash. This sparked a rush of men wanting to buy kilts. Wilson's of Bannockburn began creating a range of patterns (setts) of tartans. Wilson began naming these tartans after clans. This made sense as families within a clan tended to weave similar patterns. The tartan however wasn't the real mark of a clan; this came from badges and other forms of identification such as sprigs of juniper or Heather. Army regiments started using tartans as methods of identification and clans started to use their regiments tartan as their means of identification. Attempts were made to confirm with clan chieftains what their actual tartan was; most claimed to have no idea. In 1842 two brothers claiming to be grandsons of Prince Charlie produced a book of tartans called Vestiarum Scoticum selecting 75 different setts. They claimed the information came from Mary Queen of Scots although they never managed to reveal the manuscript when asked. Tartans became very popular in England with Queen Victoria bring a huge fan. Clan chieftains began claiming tartans for rear of being lost in the rush! Back to the question: can an Englishman married to a Scot wear a kilt for a special occasion, the answer lies in history. Follow a trend started by an English King. Today unfortunately there is way too much BS around kilts. Today's kilts are (like it or not) a far cry from the original 12 yard kilt, a monsterous heavy, inconvenient garment designed to keep impoverished Highlanders earn in very cold weather. Today's kilts tend to be partly or wholly synthetic. I have two poly rayon kilts and two cotton ones. They can be worn dressed up or down depending on the circumstance. Had these fabrics been available in the 1840\u2019s, no doubt kilt makers would have used them in the same way Beethoven would have used electric guitars had they been invented. Knowing ones history is important; when I'm wearing a kilt and someone asks me if I'm a Scot (and I have Scots heritage having been conceived in Edinburgh by a Scots father) I just smile and say the English popularised kilts in Scotland, didn't you know that? When you realize the State of California has a tartan, the mystique around kilts starts to fade. Wear a kilt wherever and whenever you want. If you're wearing it to a wedding, check the dress code first. (Source: \u201cHow the Scots invented the modern world\u201d by Arthur Herman, 2001.) ",

Anyone who wishes can wear a kilt, a sporran, a dirk and calf high socks if they wish to do so. There are rules, however, about which plaid or tartan each can wear. It depends on your clan or sept. Now there is the difficult bit. There are as many different rules as there are people who reckon they know what they are\u2026 I\u2019m a McFarlane. I was brought up to believe that I could wear the McFarlane plaid, the Royal Stuart/Stewart and, very exclusively, the Hunting Stewart. But then there are differences of opinion about exactly what each of those really should look like. I am so glad to be able to clarify all this for you\u2026 ",
