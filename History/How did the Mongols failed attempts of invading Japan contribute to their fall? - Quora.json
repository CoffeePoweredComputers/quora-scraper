            "answer_text": "The inevitable end of Mongols, as it happens with most of the successful empires built by extraordinarily capable leaders, has more to do with lack of central leadership and resulting infighting. The Mongols followed old tradition of Kurultai where the council of the family members would gather to declare successor. The next successor wouldn\u2019t always be the eldest son. Matters were complicated further when the great Khan would have different favorite and \u2018senior\u2019 wives who could claim that their son was the true heir. A glance at Genghis Khan\u2019s family tree would reveal the sheer number eligible contenders who could rightfully claim to be the Great Khan when the Kurultai commenced. The division began right before Kublai assumed the title of the Great Khan. When M\u00f6ngke (Kublai\u2019s eldest brother and ruler) died, the next Kurultai could not be successful. Kublai himself was born to the youngest son of Genghis. Hence all the remaining three family lines, each belonging to Genghis\u2019s sons claimed the throne. Eventually each of the four lines separated the entire empire in four parts and the head of largest chunk to the south east nominally held the title of the Greta Khan. This is the fragmented empire, inherited by Kublai-  Even though there was a semblance of unity, all the four divisions pretty much pursued their own goals and policies. The division was further accelerated when Kublai conquered China and moved the traditional capital from Mongolian steppes to a Chinese city (present day Beijing). Eventually, Kublai would declare himself the founding emperor of the Yuan dynasty. His future actions resemble more to a traditional Chinese emperor, complete with cultural undertones, than to rugged steppe leader of Mongols. Even his portraits depict a thoroughly Sinicized version of a benevolent ruler.  Consequently, by the time Kublai implemented his Japanese invasion, he was more of a Chinese emperor than a Great Khan. Even though, both his attempts failed, none of them were existential threats. He also invaded Korea, Vietnam, island in southern sees and part of western Europe. Some of them were successful some were not, like Japan. The land Kublai controlled was too vast and abundant in resources. He would rule over one of the most stable and prosperous period as Emperor of China. As other rulers followed Kublai, even though they held the nominal title of the Great Khan, their control over the remaining Mongol empire continuously waned. The remaining subdivisions were having trouble with infighting and succession issues as well. By the time Kublai\u2019s Yuan empire came to its end the remaining Mongol rulers wouldn\u2019t even consider them Mongol due to excessive exposure to the Chinese culture. The issue of succession would forever plague the descendants of Genghis. Eventually, any capable leader could claim the lineage to Genghis to legitimize the rule. Which is what a vanquished son of provincial ruler in central Asia did. He claimed the right of divine rule because his link to the Great Khan through Timur. His name was Babur, founder of the Mughal dynasty in India.  KurultaiDivision of the Mongol EmpireYuan dynasty",

If a great number of soldiers die, the country gets unstable. People stand for their rights, and other empires benefit from it. Attacks become easy and hence the downfall of Mongols and many other empires in the same way. ",
