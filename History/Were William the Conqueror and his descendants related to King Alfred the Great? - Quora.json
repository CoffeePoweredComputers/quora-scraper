            "answer_text": "William the Conqueror was not a descendant of Alfred the Great. He was related, of course, but not through common ancestors who are traceable through records. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say their most recent common ancestor was an unknown and unknowable 3rd to 5th century warlord who led Frankish/Saxon pirate raids in the post-Roman Channel. One of these could easily have left descendants in 1) the families who would later become William\u2019s Breton and Frankish ancestors and 2) the families who would become Alfred\u2019s Anglo-Saxon ancestors. William\u2019s only politically important relationship to Alfred was that in 1066 his first cousin once removed on his mother\u2019s side was Edward the Confessor\u2014one of only two living male-line descendants of Alfred. William\u2019s claim was that Edward chose him as heir, and he conquered based on that claim. As for William\u2019s descendants, however, all were descendants of Alfred the Great. That is, if we assume William the Bastard\u2014same man (not his preferred name)\u2014had no illegitimate children of his own. He didn\u2019t acknowledge any, and most genealogists doubt the most commonly claimed one\u2014William Peverel. So, William the Conqueror\u2019s eight known children were all born to his wife Matilda of Flanders, who was a descendant of Alfred the Great through one line. So Alfred the Great was William the Conqueror\u2019s great-great-great-great-great-grandfather-in-law. Alfred the Great, King of England m. Ealhswith\u00a0\u00c6lfthryth m.

But they all already had at least one. ",

            "answer_text": "William isn\u2019t related to Alfred in the sense of \u2018sharing blood\u2019, or William being a direct descendant of Alfred\u2019s. William\u2019s children however were related to Alfred There are also several links between the House of Normandy and the House of Wessex that I will mention. William\u2019s great-great aunt was Emma of Normandy. Emma married \u00c6thelred, King of England, who was the great-great grandson of Alfred. William\u2019s wife was Matilda of Flanders she the great(x5) granddaughter of Alfred. This means that William and Matilda\u2019s children, King William II and King Henry I were the great(x6) grandchildren of Alfred. Henry I further linked the line of the House of Normandy to that of the House of Wessex by marrying Matilda of Scotland, she may have been the daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland, but she was also great(x5) granddaughter of Alfred and the great granddaughter of Edmund Ironside ,King of England. So this means that their daughter, Matilda, is related to Alfred on both were fathers and mothers side. The rest of the Monarchs of England are all descended from Matilda, obviously included her son Henry II, who went on the become one of England\u2019s greatest Kings  Henry II, Great grandson of William the Conquerer and the great(x8) grandson of Alfred the great. Henry II is considered by some to be England\u2019s greatest king ",
