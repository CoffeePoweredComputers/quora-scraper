            "answer_text": "Most likely the answer is yes. They can monitor the traffic and see what you've been searching. That said, unless you are searching some pretty heavy topics (stuff that definitely wouldn't fly with your parents), the chances of them noticing your traffic and looking into it would be slim to none. If you would like to combat them viewing your searches, you can use a VPN. I use a free VPN on my iPhone called FreeVPN. Watch an ad before connecting, then connect and enjoy (from what I've seen) unlimited data usage. Works for me at my school and is pretty fast too. ",
