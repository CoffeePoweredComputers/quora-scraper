            "answer_text": "It was the search for spices which provided the impetus for exploration outside Europe and North Africa. Europe was suffering huge falls in population from bubonic plague and it was thought that nutmeg in particular could cure or protect against this deadly disease. The old routes across indonesia , the Indian ocean, The Arabian Sea, The Middle East and Ottoman empire required spices to change hands many times, each with a mark up for profit and above that Ottoman taxes, so by the time they Reached Europe prices were astronomical; more precious than gold. Columbus\u2019 mission was to find a way round the earth to the East by going west but only 5 or so years later Vasco da Gama found a route around Africa and thence to India and eventually to the Spice Islands of the East Indes (now Indonesia). Dutch and then English merchants joined in the race and fought wars between each other and the Portuguese for the rights to trade. Later, in addition to spices came gold, silver ,tobacco, chocolate, coffee, rubber, sugar and exotic vegetables like potatoes and tomatoes from South America, ivory from Africa and silk, gems, cotton, porcelain and tea from China & India. The pope wanted in on the action and so the Catholic Church sent missionaries to pacify the natives and \u2018save souls\u2019 for christianity. After warehouses, churches were often the next thing to be built at harbours and trading posts. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a number of reasons, but the predominant reason would be trade. Europeans had developed wide trading networks over many centuries, and had tapped into sophisticated Asian and African trading routes. Prior to the fifteenth century the Genoans, driven by competition with the Venetians, began to expand their activities across Europe and crucially also into North Africa and Portugal. These Genoese merchants and sailors took goods, ideas and technologies with them to Portugal that were used by the Portuguese. Moreover, they also shared the desire to enrich themselves by extending their trading activities into Africa in the hope of gaining access to other networks. Portugal lacked certain resources, and therefore for the Portuguese it meant sense to enrich themselves through trade. This activity was notably seen under Henry the Navigator (1394 - 1460): HISTORY OF PORTUGAL Another important reason for the Age of Exploration is the Fall of Constantinople (1453). The control of the former area of Byzantium acted as an incentive for Europeans to look for new ways to gain access to Asia and the Silk Roads, partly because they did not want to pay additional taxes levied by the Ottomans. Europeans, particularly the Portuguese and Spanish early on, began to search for new routes to the East and influenced other European nations to do the same.
