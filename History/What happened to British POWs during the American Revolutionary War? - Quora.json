            "answer_text": "In the 18th century, when there was a war, the opposing sides would quickly work out what was called a \u201ccartel,\u201d or prisoner exchange. The two sides would then periodically swap prisoners; nobody had the facilities or resources to hold POWs for the duration in an era when wars could drag on for nearly a decade. I can\u2019t speak for the American Revolutionary War in what became the U.S., but in India (to which the conflict spread in 1778), the POW rules of European warfare applied in battles between the British and the French. Surrendering troops would lay down their arms and cry, \u201cParole!\u201d This was the formal way to surrender. If you were an officer, you handed over your sidearm, and you were sent to a secure enemy town, where you\u2019d swear not to escape, etc., or serve again in the war. You\u2019d then be billeted on a local family, and you\u2019d get a little spending money. You were permitted to attend balls and banquets, maybe take your horse out for a ride, etc., all very civilized. If you were an officer. If you were a soldier, things were tougher. The British locked French POWs in an old rice warehouse in Madras (Chennai), which eventually housed several hundred men. The French, meanwhile, shipped British POWs to Mauritius, were they were locked up in old forts, jails, etc., while their officers lived on the local plantations. Occasionally, a neutral vessel would be chartered to undertake a POW exchange. Occasionally, officers were returned to their own side, but their governments were bound to let them honor their promise not to serve again during the war. If you fell into the hands of the Marathas or the Mysoreans, however, you faced a far more precarious fate. To begin with, the European niceties didn\u2019t apply. If they let you live, you might end up languishing in a dungeon, sometimes in chains; you might be tortured and \u201cconverted\u201d to Islam (which would involve circumcision), and forced to join their side, and even issued a wife (usually a captive herself); or you might be dragged out one day and murdered, sometimes by having a nail driven into your brain. Stories were told of professional strongmen (wrestlers) being used to crush skulls and break necks. A lot of horrific things were attributed to the Mysoreans, but one charge that was not true was that they threw British POWs over cliffs. A few sepoys (Indian soldiers working for the British) may have suffered this fate, but I never found any evidence of British soldiers taking a dive when I worked in the archives on this; and that\u2019s good, because those cliffs in Mysore are hundreds of feet high. The worst thing about being a prisoner of the Mysoreans, however, was that they didn\u2019t always release you when the war was over. That and the fact that you usually received no medical attention if wounded or sick. The Mysoreans usually kept British officers they captured in a special lockup in their capital, Seringapatam. The officers were given a small stipend, with which to buy food, etc., but this was supplied to them by the British Government. The conditions in this prison seem to have been on a par with what British soldiers experienced in Japanese POW camps in Southeast Asia during WWII, albeit with slightly better food. ",

            "answer_text": "They were in fact badly treated. Colonel Campbell of the 78th was kept chained for months on the pretence that Ethan Allen of the Green Montain boys was being badly treated. The Loyalist Soldiers were even more badly treated and were kept down in mines for instance. However, much of it was caused by the financial problems the rebels had. The Patriots were also very bad at providing for their own troops let alone British prisoners, After the Warm the Patriots did not pay their men the land promised. In contrast British soldiers did very well after the War if they settled in Canada. One reason the Scots had such an impact in Canada was that so many were soldiers that they were a landowning class from the American Revolution on. ",
