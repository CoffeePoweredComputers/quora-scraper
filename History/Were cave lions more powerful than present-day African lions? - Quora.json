            "answer_text": "Yes. African lions nowadays weigh 212 to 580 pounds cave lions weighed 440 to 770 pounds   Cave lions were larger and stronger than any big cat that lives in the wild today. African lions have a bite of 691 to 1,200 psi cave lions had a bite of 1,800 psi according to some articles. Lions hunt just about anything from deer to African elephants . Males can hunt zebra Nile crocs and even cape buffalo alone which can weigh up to 2,300 pounds ! Cave lions hunted elk giant bison,mammoth s and cave bear. Cave lions can hunt elk young bison and mammoth alone . They often hunted solo like a tiger but hunted big animals in pairs or in 3 . They hunted cave bears while hibernating and killed female bears head on but not males. So yea cave lions were alot stronger than today's African lions and would probably beat them 9/10 times. When scientists do clone cave lions they'll be the most dominant big cat.  ",

Examinations of their bones reveal that, while they did share similar body proportions to African lions, the limb bones were thicker relative to their length, i.e. they were more robustly built than their extant counterpart. This would likely mean that they were more powerful. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02724634.2018.1467921?journalCode=ujvp20 ",
