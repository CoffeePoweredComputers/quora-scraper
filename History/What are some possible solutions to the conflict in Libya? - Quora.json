There are several possibly \u201csolutions\u201d to the conflict in Libya and the most likely (generically speaking) one of them is that some corrupt and brutal regime will end up holding power and \u201ccleansing\u201d the country of \u201canti-social elements\u201d. The least likely \u201csolution\u201d to the conflict is that a widely recognized and accepted government will be installed after free, fair, open, and honest elections and will then proceed to govern Lybia in the best interests of all Libyans.

            "answer_text": "First of all, let\u2019s try to identify the conflict; The conflict is mainly between multiple militias that have strong military existence on the ground, these militias group together so it has more impact. Many foreign countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Emirates, and Egypt .. etc supports the militias that fits their interests. The possible solutions are: _ one side wins, but this is quite unlikely in the near future, and there is no real harmony even within each side anyway. _ Splitting the power by an agreement. Due to the fjnancial pressure on militias because of the stopping of oil supplies and the less finance from foreign countries, the sides have been trying to reach some kind of an agreement, but not much progress so far.
