            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t speak about other countries, but in England there were no out gay kings in the modern sense of the term out during the Middle Ages. However, there were some whose bi- or homosexuality was an open secret in their own lifetime. James the 1st was nicknamed \u201cQueen James\u201d in his own court. He had a series of young male lovers.Edward the 2nd had a famous and public love affair with Piers GavestonRichard the Lionheart had a love affair with the King of France, although he also married, and pursued many women.William Rufus\u2019s court was accused of effeminacy and sodomy by the church in his lifetime. They couldn\u2019t make those charges directly against the king without being accused of treason, so this was the closest they could come. Almost uniquely among English monarchs, he never married or had children, despite ruling as an adult for 13 years, so you may draw your own conclusions.",
