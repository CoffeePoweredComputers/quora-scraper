            "answer_text": "They were killed, worked to death, tortured, forced to be human guinea pigs for medical experiments, forced to cremate the bodies and clean up the gas chambers, starved, and used as slave laborers. There is one small group of 142 Jewish concentration camp inmates who were selected to work in a Nazi counterfeiting operation Operation Bernhard. The Nazis used a couple barracks in Sachsenahusen concentration camp to hold the Jewish prisoners who helped the Nazis make counterfeit British pound notes, passports, identification cards, and any other documents the Nazis needed. The Jews selected were printers, copper engravers, graphic artists, former bankers, and also included 1 professional counterfeiter who had been arrested before the war for counterfeiting money. Unlike the rest of the Jews held in the camps, they were treated humanely, they were fed appropriately, they didn\u2019t have to do back breaking work every day, and they weren\u2019t subject to beatings or arbitrarily shot, but when the war was almost over a few of them were killed when they got sick because the SS didn\u2019t want to take them to a hospital, and they were all supposed to be killed before they could be liberated, but the SS ended up leaving them in a different camp and ran away before the Western Allies liberated the camp.

            "answer_text": "It really depends on which camp they were in and which work they were forced to do, but as a rule they were starved, beaten, overworked, made to stand at roll call for hours in all kinds of weather wearing prison rags, packed into barracks which were unheated and where lice and disease would run rampant, then they\u2019d end up with typhus, spotted fever, pneumonia, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, and be left without any medical care.
