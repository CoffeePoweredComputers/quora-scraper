            "answer_text": "It is not clear what is the meaning of your question. Serbs and other people living around were under occupation for many years by the Ottoman Turkish empire, Hungary, Austria, Italy, etc. From the First Serbian Uprising against the Turks in 1804. Serbs managed to free themselves from the occupying powers. Austro-Hungarian empire was slowly pushing towards South-East. They annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina and were trying to find an excuse to occupy or at least significantly defeat Kingdom of Serbia which was aspiring to unite all Serbs and to foster resistance against the Austro-Hungarians. An organization of anti-Austro-Hungarian regime called Mlada Bosna (Young Bosnia) populated mainly by Serbs, was fighting against the Austro-Hungarians. At the time, chief of the Army Intelligence Service, Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijevic-Apis (one of the leading stars in the secret organization called Black Hand (Crna ruka) which murdered King and Queen of Serbia, removed the Obrenovic dynasty and brought in Karadjordjevic dynasty) was actively plotting against the Austro-Hungarians. He helped with the arms, training, etc and basically knew that the Mlada Bosna was preparing assassination of Archduke Ferdinand. At the time Serbia just emerged victorious from the I and II Balkan Wars and definitely did not need another war. Some members of the Serbian government knew about the plans for the assassination of the Archduke. His visit to Sarajevo was to observe military manoeuvres of the Austro-Hungarian army in and around Sarajevo. Those military exercises were planned for 28.06.1914. which is the most holy date in the Serbian calendar. On 28.06.1389. (St Vitus Day or Vidovdan) Serbian King Lazar Hrebeljanovic lost a major battle at the Kosovo field. After that defeat Serbia was conquered and occupied by Otoman Turks for the next 500 years. So, it can be assumed that the Austro-Hungarians chose that particular date as a major provocation against all the Serbs. Serbian government informed the Austrian government in Vienna about the planned assassination but the Austrians chose to ignore that information. Previously, Austro-Hungarians and Germans were trying to find an excuse to start a major war. So, the assassination of the Archduke came as a golden opportunity. They started the war, pushed all the world in major disaster, lost the war and the empire, made it possible for Balkan peoples to unite in the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs which later became Kingdom of Yugoslavia, etc. In the war Kingdom of Serbia lost more than one million people due to the war and epidemics. Every second adult male lost life in the war. ",
