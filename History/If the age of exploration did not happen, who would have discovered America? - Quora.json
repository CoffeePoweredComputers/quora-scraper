            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Ozo. Leif Erikson, as Antonina Pereguda so elegantly pointed out, discovered Newfoundland. Leif was the son of Erik the Red himself a truly interesting Viking! Leif went that far West after hearing reports from other Vikings who\u2019d strayed. Leif attempted to found a settlement but it failed. See the chapter titled \u201cDiscovering Vinland! Leif Erikson - Wikipedia I saw in the notes a Norwegian discovered the settlement\u2019s ruins in 1960. Now to Columbus: He did not set out to discover the New World; he was looking for a trade route that was faster and less life-threatening than having to round the Cape of Good Hope.  So his \u201cdiscovery was an accident. In fact, Columbus believed the indigenous people he encountered to be Indians living on an island away from the Indian Subcontinent. That\u2019s why Native Americans were saddled with the label American Indians. The point of all this being somebody would have happened upon it sooner or later. It might have been anyone! ",

            "answer_text": "\u2026 You mean if the world just ended before the 15th century? Or do you mean that it happened differently than in our history and someone else reported the existence of the Americas to Europe? I mean, presuming that Europe is still a thing. Even if the entire world didn\u2019t end, maybe Europe as such doesn\u2019t exist by the time anyone gets around to trying to tell them about the Americas. You\u2019ve offered not the slightest hint of why the Age of Exploration didn\u2019t happen. It could be anything from the entire universe just suffering a random total existential failure or later historians deciding to call it the Age of Expansion or Age of Exploitation instead (or just not coming up with a particular name for it). One of these things is a bit more plausible and doesn\u2019t change anything that actually happened other than how history books referred to it later. ",
