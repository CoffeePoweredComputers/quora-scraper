            "answer_text": "Britain had few slaves in the United Kingdom itself. There were doubts about its legality at home, with some old cases saying it was not. Their issue was ending slavery in their colonies in the Caribbean and Africa, which they handled by raising a huge amount of money to pay off the owners. That is the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833. Half was paid directly to British slave owners in Africa and the Caribbean, half to their owners living in Britain. That\u2019s 20 million pounds, about 15 million borrowed. And it was mostly paid to the wealthy and well-connected. They did not include slaves owned in places like Ceylon. ",
