            "answer_text": "When it debuted in 1982, USA Today's publisher Gannett billed it as \"The Nation's Newspaper.\" Gannett presented the first newspaper to embrace color and graphics (often at the expense of quality journalism). Gannett also opted for a logo rather than just its newspaper's name in a traditional blackletter or serif typeface. The all caps, stacked bold sans serif typography and graphic globe, reversed out of a blue rectangle, were designed to be different in an image-conscious 80s way. (Another sign of this- the 1980 reintroduction of Gentlemen's Quarterly magazine to the monthly dubbed GQ, and the made-for-TV Reagan presidency). \"ALL CAPS\" was not such an original stroke of genius. It just made sense to balance the USA and globe icon. The difference was that the logo was evidence of a corporate move to focus on style over substance. I think it can be argued that the trivial interest in graphics in USA Today was an early sign of the decay of the fourth estate. That and CNN. I think Time's cover logo is not an overt statement of style or originality. It's just worked well for nearly 90 years. Their sister magazine Life also put its name in all caps in a signature red rectangle (it's had to compete with a board game and a breakfast cereal of the same name). In contrast to Time, Life's design was much more evidence of its focus on image, as it presented the best news and cultural photography available. I think it makes sense to consider a newer trend of magazine design. I'm speaking of the cover design and logos of Worth, Bloomberg Businessweek, and Harvard Business Review. Stacked bold Helvetica-esque sans serif type at the top left of the cover is taking over magazine racks. It's refreshing, but at risk of being another corporate fad. ",
