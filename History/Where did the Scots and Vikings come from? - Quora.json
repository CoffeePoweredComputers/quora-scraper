            "answer_text": "Hi We Scots are Gaels, as are the Cornish, the Welsh, the Irish, the Manx, the French.. let me explain.. The Gaels have a 7000 year heritage, the central nation was Gaul which is now called the modern France. Around 7000\u20135000BC there was still a land bridge going from northern Gaul to to the south of what is now modern England, the early Gauls crossed that bridge and began colonizing the area, which was not an island yet. Gaels are the original inhabitants of these (current) isles, sadly known as the \u2018British Isles\u2019. The Scandinavians are a splinter group of a germanic tribe, much like the English are an offshoot of their Germanic tribe (the Saxons, Anglo-Saxon, Anglo =Engl). Germany then Denmark then up to Norway, Sweden, Iceland* they spread out becoming more and more their own selves. rightly so. here\u2019s a map I made, based from around 1500BC to 500BC  Once the island was cut off the Saxons (English) started moving in and took over the south west of the island. You can see Scotland and Wales were much larger. The system of governance was dynastal, meaning the head of the family was the head of the community, Gaels were known as fierce warriors, very family oriented and peaceful for the most part to other Gaels (don\u2019t believe everything you hear about \u2018wars\u2019 within the Gaels .. no civilization could make a trading route so advanced, if they were constantly at war). We had a colony in Galatia, St. Paul even wrote to the Galatians.. which when I read that book now, I take a certain pride that these were my relatives, and the relatives of all Gael peoples. King Kenneth McAlpin a Norwegian sailor turned nobleman turned politician, The First King of Scotland, was a unifying force throughout what would become the Kingdom of Scotland. Every Scot of every clan can trace their lineage back to Kenneth, as he founded the clan system. We are all descended from him. I am descended from him via~ Shaws>MacIntoshes>McDuffs> King (Dub) Duff MacMalcolm his great great grandson. And all Scots of a clan can trace their ancestry back to King Kenneth. This is why I say of Norway, Scotland and Norway are half sisters. Every Scot has Scandinavian Norwegian blood via King Kenneth. I hope I answered your question and enlightened your day. *You can see Catalonia (and other parts of Northern Spain), Northern Italy, part of Romania and the Anatolian mountain range are all part of that Gael heritage, even though Turkey is mostly Arabic in ethnicity, some Turkish remember they are part Gael. I had a Turkish acquaintance once who mentioned this to me, but I was too stupid to understand it, and it wasn\u2019t until ten years later when I researched did I understand. I feel stupid remembering that moment when he told me and I was oblivious. *(The Fins are also Scandinavian.. but that\u2019s (too many herring in the kettle) whole other topic as they have complicated roots and politics that I won\u2019t go into here, there\u2019s also the unpopular history they have with the Russians, which they like to avoid etc) *Because Kenneth was Scandinavian, he used the Scandinavian system for clan system much like Iceland still uses a very similar system for personal last names.. \u2018Mac\u2019 means \u2018son of\u2019 in Scots, the Scandinavian system such as; Alfred Alfredsson, his father\u2019s name is Alfred also.
