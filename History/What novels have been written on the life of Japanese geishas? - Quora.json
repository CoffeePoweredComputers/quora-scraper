            "answer_text": "\u201cSnow Country\u201d by Yasunari Kawabata. Its plot centers on a geisha named Komoko who works at an onsen in the Japanese countryside of yukiguni, an area which receives more snow than almost any place on Earth. The plot is simple and could be summed up in a few sentences, but in Kawabata\u2019s works the story is secondary to the epiphanic precision in which he paints the emotions of his characters and juxtaposes them with delicate descriptions of landscapes. It is a love story written with the elegance of a haiku, and one of the classics of Japanese literature. Kawabata was one of the most important post-war Japanese novelists. He won the Nobel Prize of Literature in 1968 \"for his narrative mastery, which with great sensibility expresses the essence of the Japanese mind\". Snow Country is probably his most famous work and was one of the three works cited when he was awarded the Nobel Prize. Some people have recommended \u201cMemoirs of a Geisha\u201d; while it\u2019s a decent romance novel, it\u2019s not going to give you an authentic Japanese perspective since it was written by an English author, Arthur Golden.
