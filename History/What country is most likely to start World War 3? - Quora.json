            "answer_text": "World War 3 will start as most wars do, by alliances with smaller nations. No hot war begins with a big slugging match. It starts with overwhelming force against a territory that can\u2019t defend itself over reasons typically involving land disputes and resources. The most likely cause today are two hotspots that would easily grow out of control. Taiwan - Even as the United States no longer formally recognizes them, we keep them around in the same way China keeps North Korea around. If China decides to finally follow through on threats of invading, then this could potentially draw the US in. It all depends on the current president and Congress at the time it happens. I\u2019d say it would be an unpopular War so if China were careful about how they approached it, then it wouldn\u2019t grow into a World War. If the US does get involved, it likely means China will be contained and forced to give reparations as well as dismantling their South China Sea island bases and relinquish territorial claims they have with other nations. It won\u2019t include an actual landing in China because they have a large arsenal of nuclear weapons they would likely use if they felt threatened. It would make more sense to have an active blockade and a campaign to free Taiwan and end it there. This would be a coalition of the willing so technically not a World War unless mistakes were made. Baltic States - The litttle green men are across the border in large numbers and their scenario in Crimea and the Donbas reads like a chapter out of World War playbooks. They were obligated to intervene when the evil Ukrainians were trying to suppress their poor innocent Russian brethren in a war of culture so they were obligated to help the Russian speaking oppressed there. The Baltic\u2019s represent a large area of valuable coast and still have a large Russian minority. Russian citizens in those nations aren\u2019t allowed to vote, so they would qualify as being oppressed. The only thing preventing it is Article 5 of NATO. This would escalate right away and if Russia attempted a similar proxy war, they would fail. This scenario would break norms by escalating into a war quickly if they chose to intervene on behalf of their proxy forces. A hot war would likely be fought in places like the Baltic\u2019s, Kaliningrad, Belarus and Ukraine. It wouldn\u2019t include principal land like Russia, America or mainland Europe without the risk of escalating beyond cruise missiles. I\u2019m too worried to consider how it looks the minute the first cruise missile lands in the US or Russia and at what point that escalates to something more. ",

            "answer_text": "On current form I would say the United States. For a war to be called a Third World War it would need to have the US, China and/ or Russia involved. I don\u2019t think it would be as a result of direct confrontation between the US and Russia or China but an escalation over a third party such as North Korea or an Eastern European nation like the Ukraine . If you look at the world from a non western perspective, America effectively has a constraining ring around China with bases in Japan, Korea, Guam and Okinawa. It also has reasonable relations with Vietnam. This is the equivalent of the CONUS having semi belligerent neighbours in Mexico, Canada, Hawai and the Caribbean all of whom have bases for China or Russia. Russia is similarly challenged with a powerful NATO on its western flank and right up to its borders and Japan and Alaska in the Pacific. Both of these nations therefore feel somewhat defensive. All it would take is for America to launch some sort of strike on North Korea over nuclear weapons and China might feel to the need to strike back at Taiwan as a warning to the USA. Alternately if the Chinese politburo has rising discontent at home due to the trade war with the US, it might feel it has no other option than to lash out. Then again if America pushes for closer relations or increases sales of high end military equipment with Taiwan this could cause China to invade rather than lose face. In the case of Russia it could be a misunderstanding in the Syria which sees US and Russian forces clash. My point is that nations under pressure can react in unpredictable and dangerous ways. America is exerting pressure on China through the trade war and Russia via sanctions. Whether this is justified or not is a different question. The good news is that I doubt the war would last long or escalate. All three are aware of the high stakes involved. It would probably be clashes at sea or in Syria backed up by cyber warfare. ",
