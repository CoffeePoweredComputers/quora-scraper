            "answer_text": "There are several causes for the decline of the Mughal empire. The major reasons are; the decline was gradual and although some historians blame Aurangzeb for sowing the seeds of decline, the empire continued for another 150 years after his death.Firstly, the nature of the empire that because of its administration. The Mughals had a very huge empire which was very difficult to control because of this the emperor could not know what was happening in every part of the empire. the Mughal empire was huge and within the empire there was an array of different religions. It should also not be forgotten that it was often true that huge sums were wasted when emperors died and there was a succession dispute.Secondly, because of the weak control as the wealth influence of the nobility grew so that they became highly powerful at court and some of the emperors found it very difficult to control them. With weak control from the centre, the Mansabadari system was not sufficiently supervised and administrative efficiency declined. Discontent grew and revenue from tax collection declined.Lastly, the arrival of the British. Since the time of Jehangir the English East India Company tried to take advantage of the wealth to be gained by trade with India. England had been the first country to experience the industrial revolution. Its industries were producing cheap manufactured goods which were sold around the world. The weaknesses of the Mughal empire, together with the strength of the British, meant that the fall of one of the mightiest dynasties in history was almost inevitable. ",

            "answer_text": "No, arrival of the East India Company is one of the significant reasons but not the most important reasons. There are other factors that are responsible which are listed as follows- Aurangzeb had fought a long war in the deccan that had depleted the military and financial resources of the empire.The later mughal emperors were not efficient enough in handling the administration.The empire faced severe retaliations from the Marathas, sikhs and other combined forces.In addition to this there are other factors as well which led to a significant decline of the empire.
