            "answer_text": "Okay the question can not be answered in a few words but i guess that's what makes an answer simple and interesting. Short ,compact and serving the purpose World war 2 or Second World War is one the largest military conflict in History which stretched for 6 bloody long years from September 9 1939 to May 8th (European theater) or September 2nd 1945(Pacific theater), fought mainly between two alliances, the Allied and the Axis powers Allied comprised of Great Britain, The United States, Russia, Exiled Polish Govt. , Provisional French Govt., British Commonwealth i.e Canada, Australia, India(if you say so) and China. Axis power included Germany, Japan, Italy, Romania, Free French Vici Forces. In short Germany invaded Poland on Sep 9 1939, making England and France to immediately declare on Germany. Russia at the initial stage had a secret pact with Hitler and invaded Poland on the same day as well. Poland was equally divided by Germany and Russia. Later Hitler disregarded the friendly pact and invaded Russia in 1941. Russia thus shifter from Axis power to Allied power as you can guess. In 1940 Hitler turned his eyes towards France, France fell in a few weeks, then came Great Britain's time, but England being an island nation and the largest naval power at that time Hitler couldn't succeed. Germany and Italy fought alongside in Northern Africa as well but eventually were removed completely by end 1942. At a pint during mid 1942 Hitler conquered almost 80% of Europe and 30% of Russia.  Hitlers campaigns and conquers followed with massive war crimes, mass killing, especially against Jews.  By end 1942 German forces were too stretched and weak, Allied forces for the first time started tasting victories against Germany. By mid 1944 German forces were totally driven out of mainland Russia,Hungary. This was the scenario in the European theater of war. In the pacific theater Japan was a major power and were in a killing spree all over the South Asian archipelago, they attacked USA in Pearl Harbor in Dec 1941 thus making USA enter the war. USA fought Japan throughout the war only in the pacific. No Japanese foot soldier ever landed in American mainland neither did any American soldier ever stepped in Japanese mainland. Most of Japanese colonies of held territory were liberated by Allied forced by mid 1945.  European theater ended when Germany surrendered in May 1945 and Pacific theater came to an end when Japan surrendered after the Atomic detonations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki World war 2 witnessed almost 60 million deaths (which goes as high as 80 million if death related to diseases and famine are included) and 80% of them are military casualties. Russia, Germany, China and Poland suffered the maximum damage.  6 million Jews were systematically slaughtered by Hitlers Germany as a process for the Final Solution.  The horrors of the war were immense from such mammoth loss of life, cities were reduced to rubble, entire countries totally razed, millions were homeless, thousands were raped, widespread famine, diseases. The end of the war led to the foundation of two political poles, or two super powers. One is United states of America and the other being USSR. It also sowed the seeds for a Third World war. ",

            "answer_text": "World War II \u201cisn\u2019t\u201d anything. World War II WAS a global war that began, according to most historians, with Japanese aggression in China in 1937, and separately in Europe with the German invasion of Poland in September 1939. The European war originally was largely confined to the European landmass, except for actions at sea all over the world, until the Germans, having conquered Norway, Denmark, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, turned east again and invaded the Soviet Union. The USA was initially not a combatant but played a significant role as a supplier of food, arms, munitions, and raw materials to Great Britain and to the USSR, and then took an increasing role in protecting the shipping from the US and Canada to Britain, putting it in conflict with German U-Boats in an undeclared naval war. The USA was brought into the war by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, Wake Island in the mid-Pacific, Guam in the Marianas, and the Philippines in December 1941, and then Germany declared war on the US days after the Pearl Harbor attack, so that this was now truly a global war. This was humankind\u2019s most destructive war to date, and it involved widespread bombing of cities, the first (and so far only) use of nuclear weapons in war, and the development and, for that time, the perfection of many weapons systems and technologies, including jet engines to power airplanes, the use of aircraft carriers, advanced radar and sonar techniques, and the development of unmanned ballistic rockets by the Germans. It was also the war that saw indiscriminate slaughter of civilians, not only as \u201cincidental\u201d or \u201cancillary\u201d casualties as in bombing of urban industries, but in the German slave labor camps and death camps, the German extermination programs outside of the camps (mostly in portions of the USSR invade by them), of Chinese civilians by the Japanese, and by the Soviets in their POW and political prisoner camps, which were mostly a new phenomenon in the pantheon of awful behaviors exhibited by some human beings against others. Thus WW II was a historical event, which ended in practical terms in 1945 with the surrender of the German and Japanese armed forces. Actual peace treaties didn\u2019t come until later. It had many long-term consequences, and is best understood by reading detailed histories about its origins, the events that led up to it, and the events that transpired during it. This is not a small task if you really don\u2019t know any of this and ask this question sincerely\u2026you have a lot of reading to do to properly understand this. ",
