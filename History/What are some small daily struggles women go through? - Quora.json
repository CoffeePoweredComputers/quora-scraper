            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat are some small daily struggles women go through? Activities like drying long hair, shaving your armpits/legs etc. Nothing about sexism please\u201c. Alright, so you want to know some daily struggles women go through in life, but only if these struggles don't have anything to do with sexism. I'm sorry, but if you want to know what women really are struggling with (shaving your legs isn't a struggle, it's a choice; it's something you do because you want to, not because you have to), then you shouldn't try to set up any rules and restrictions; if you want to hear what women are struggling with, then let us write what our struggles are (and I'm sure gonna list mine no matter if you want to hear them or not): I find it really tiring to constantly see questions such as \u201cWhat do girls/women like to do?\u201d, \u201cHow do I learn to understand women?\u201d, and \u201cWhat will my girlfriend like to receive for her birthday?\u201d. These questions imply that all women are the same and that we aren't individual human beings, when in reality, we enjoy tons of different things and are often very different from each other.Some other struggles (for me as an individual, not for all women in the world) currently include doing the dishes, studying chemistry for hours, walking my dog in the rain, trying to decide what to do with my life and how to make money, while also trying to get enough exercise, trying to accept all the evil in the world and being there for my friends and relatives no matter if I have the energy for it or not. Life isn't always easy, and sometimes I'm struggling, whereas other times, I'm really happy; sometimes both things at once.Oh and I would also define it as a struggle to see a question like this on Quora and to be told by anyone that I can't talk about sexism. I am capable of struggling with lots of other things than drying my hair, thank you. When it all comes down to it, most of my struggles are struggles many people in the Western world are facing, too, no matter their gender.",
