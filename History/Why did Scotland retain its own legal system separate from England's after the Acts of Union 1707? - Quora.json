            "answer_text": "Nowadays there is very little difference between Scots and English law. Terminology is different and land law is very different and the court precedents differ on criminal law but 90% of it is either identical or so close to identical it may as-well be. This was not the case in 1707. Both systems differed enormously. Scotland was not yet even a functional democracy so jurisprudence regarding sovereignty of parliament had not even been developed yet. Scottish law was driven by adherence to principles (some very ancient) and English law was dependent on common law or the spoken judgements of legal authorities. The problem in 1707 is there was no real means of combining the two and neither system was superior to the other. The faculty of advocates had been established for 200 years, the court of session and HCJ both as old. This highly developed field had no expertise in English law so could not adapt it. The same is true of English legal scholars and Scots law. To summarise combining the two was not possible and an \u201cannexation\u201d even more impossible. The only option left was the one taken. Caveats however that while the legal systems remained separate they Recognise the same supreme source of law (parliament)For civil law have the same highest appellant court (HOL 1707\u20132009, UKSC 2009-)The country was therefore able to function easily with both systems being extant. Over centuries convergence has taken place to produce the world class legal system of the UK in the present day. Areas such as companies law, immigration law, employment law, constitutional law, international law, commercial law and customs and excise regulations can be referred to as \u201cBritish law\u201d. Contract law is so similar it may aswell be identical despite converging from different places. To answer your question there was no reasonable alternative in 1707 than what happened. It was not an annexation it was two advanced equal partners choosing to do what was best for both. A combined legal system was unworkable as neither was superior and neither would have any reason to consent to it. There are numerous ratios from the HOL in the 18th and 19th centuries from Judges struggling with a \u201cforeign system\u201d. Scots law has increasingly grown to include common law discourse and legislation has grown to play a larger part in English law. Natural convergence was preferable to the chaos of the alternative. ",

            "answer_text": "Because the Union with Scotland Act 1706 Article XVIII and XXV (Union with Scotland Act 1706) have ruled that except for regulations on trade customs, excises and inconsistent laws, both English and Scottish laws shall remain as such. This is confirmed in the Union with England Act 1707 (Union with England Act 1707). This principle is agreed in the Treaty of Union 1706 Article 18 and 19. As a result, the Union never had a united jurisdiction from the very beginning. This practice is latter followed by Ireland in 1801. Scots law is very ancient, probably even earlier than England as a country. It's nearly impossible to merge English and Scottish laws. Thus, attempts to create a single jurisdiction during the Acts of Union will be seen as some kinds of suppression. Also, it's not uncommon for a country composing different legal systems. Louisiana and Quebec are substantially different from American and Canadian laws, both federal and state/provincial levels. ",
