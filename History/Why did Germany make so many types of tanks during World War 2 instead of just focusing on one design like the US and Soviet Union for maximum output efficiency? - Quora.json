            "answer_text": "A very good question. Germany had supply shortages long before the war. They knew that the combined allied production could outproduce that. The Germans did have a few main battle tanks such as the Sturmgeschutz variants and the panzer iii and iv. Also the tiger tanks and it\u2019s variants and also the panther tanks (panzer v) The Germans opted for reliability rather then quantity. Their formations were also not tank heavy. The Germans were reluctant into engaging into tank on tank warfare. This can be seen in Rommel\u2019s tactics in North Africa, where he would bait British tanks into kill zones where anti tank guns and infantry would wait for them. The Germans knew that tank on tank warfare was bad. The constant need to replace tanks would drain resources they could have used elsewhere. The large number of tanks would either make good target practice for enemy aircraft and it would consume too much fuel. The focus on reliability has more tactical value. German attack formations would not be with tanks first, as it is motorized divisions and infantry who would need to start a fire fight and only then for the tanks to engage an enemy and support infantry on infantry. The Germans adopted this tactic earlier in the war. The allies only learned this much later that combined arms warfare is good. As for the variations, the Germans had to keep producing better tanks, as the allies were now producing better anti tank guns, which could be easily moved around (towed) and set up faster. The Germans had to opt for thicker front armor and more sloped designs. The later model tanks were also designed to travel faster then earlier models. When you think of tank destroyer tanks, do not look at games and movies. These tanks were mainly used to ambush enemy tank formations by destroying the first tank in the column and then the last tank. This would create confusion and the German tank crews would have time to eliminate as many tanks as possible. The tank formations were also very versatile, with only one tiger with a number of other tanks, as they were not such a common sight on the battlefield as believed. The Germans had to build tanks to suite their current needs. If they did not build better tanks, they would lose more tanks. If they built more tanks, they would lose resources. Each tank also had a specific purpose and in their tanker training it was sufficiently outlined how tank formations battle orders go. They would have to use these powerful tanks to their advantage as not many would come around. Staying with one design too long makes it obsolete. Making many cheaper ones, drops their resource supplies. There wasn\u2019t much oil, nor exotic metals for proper Luftwaffe support. ",

            "answer_text": "Well the question is wrong The germans did use many types of tanks (as seen below) and self propelled guns, but so did the US and USSR (more seen below). Of note, I am only including tanks made in each country, and which saw combat, so no panzer 35 or 38s or any of their versions Now just to show, the german tanks and AFVs:  Neubaufahrzeug super heavy tank  King tiger  Tiger 1  Panzer 3  Panzer 4  Panzer 5 panther  Panzer 1  Panzer 2  Stug 3  Stug 4  Brummbar  Sturmtiger  Dicker Max  Jagdpanther  Jagdpanzer 4  Marder 1  Marder 2  The other marder 2  Nashorn  Another version of the panzer 4  Panzerjager 1  Elephant tank destroyer  Jagdtiger  10.5cm leFH 18/1 (Sf) auf Geschutzwagen IVb  Bison self propelled guns  15cm s.l.G.33 auf Fahrgestell Pz.Kpfw.ll (Sf.)  Hummel self propelled guns  Hummel wasp self propelled guns  Wasp self propelled guns  Flakpanzer 1  Whirlwind flak guns  Mobilewagon flak guns  Sd.Kfz.13 light armoured cars  Sd. kfz.222 armoured cars  6 Rad-heavy armoured cars  8 Rad-heavy armoured cars  Puma heavy armoured cars  Sd.kfz. 247 APCs  Sd. kfz. 250  Sd. kfz. 251  Sd. Kfz. 253 For a total of 41 vehicles- 3 halftracks, 6 armoured cars, 3 flak guns, 10 SPGs, 11 TDs, and 8 tanks Now on to the american vehicles  MTLS-1G14 light tanks  M3  M4 medium tanks  M26 pershings  M26 super pershings  M22 locust tanks  M2 light tanks  M24 chaffee light tanks  M3 light tanks  M5  CTLS-4TA  CTMS-1TB1  M6 tank destroyer  M10 tank destroyer  M18  M36  M7  M8  M2  M3  M8 armoured cars  M3 scout cars  LVT-1  LVT-2  LVT-3  LVT-4 water buffalo  LVT-1A amtrack  Jumbo tanks For a total of 28 vehicles, including 2 halftracks, 13 tanks, 4 tank destroyers, 2 self propelled guns, 2 armoured cars, and 5 amphibious vehicles. So they did use a large amount if vehicles, and more tanks then the germans (at least which they built) Now the soviets:  IS-1  IS-2  KV-1  KV-1S, a version with less armour and a different gun  KV-85, a IS-1 turret on a kv chassis  T-35 heavy tanks  T-24, which were heavily modified and used as pillboxes  T-28  T-34s  BT-2s  BT-5s  Bt-7  KHtz-16 tractor tanks  NI tractor tanks  T-26  T-50  T-60  T-70s  T-37  T-38  T-40  SU-100  SU-85  Zis-30  ISU-122  ISU-152  KV-2  SU-122  SU-152  SU-76  SU-76i  BA-10 armoured cars  BA-11  BA-20 light armoured cars  BA-27 armoured cars  BA-3  BA-64  BAI heavy armoured cars  Fai light armoured cars For a total of 39 vehicles, including 8 armoured cars, 6 assault guns, 1 self propelled guns, 3 tank destroyers, and 19 tank types, which is far more then any other nation So the germans did actually use less of their own types of tanks then both the US and USSR, however they used many more types of tank destroyer and self propelled guns, as well as tanks from another nations. This is because they had to build an entire armoured force during the war-so using existing chassis and updating them was all they could do, as well as using everything else they took. ",
