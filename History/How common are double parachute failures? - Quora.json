            "answer_text": "It is extremely rare for both your main and reserve not deploy. Sometimes in very extreme circumstances a reserve may have a partial malfunction, such as a line over, but can still be landed with some extent of injury. Main canopy malfunctions are much more common than reserve malfunctions, because they are often packed with haste to get on another jump and around distractions like others talking to you while you pack. A reserve, on the other hand, is packed by a FAA certified rigger who goes through a deliberate step-by-step process while packing a reserve which can take over an hour. Reserves also deploy under the pressure of a spring-load pilotchute which forces the pilotchute into clean air creating immediate drag pulling the reserve closing pin that contains the reserve canopy. Parachutes want to open and fly by design. As outsiders looking into the sport of skydiving this is a common question, the most assumed reason non-skydivers believe skydivers die. Actually this is quite, quite rare. Actually, about half of skydiving fatalities are highly skilled canopy pilots flying very high performance canopies such as the Comp Velocity, Peregrine, Xaos, etc. Landing these canopies takes immense skill and concentration, one miscalculation can be fatal and often is. This is something that can take hundreds of jumps and years to build up to, but with the esprit to become better, a better badass, comes a price. Pushing the envelope in any high speed sport has a price. Also, I am seeing that BASE fatalities are being convoluted with skydiving fatalities because of the popularity of wingsuits. BASE jumping is the most dangerous extreme sport. Skydiving is much, much more safer than BASE jumping, in fact most BASE jumpers have hundreds of skydives before they start to BASE jump. Wingsuits add a great amount of complexity to skydiving and BASE jumping. Proximity flying, that is flying a wingsuit close to terrain is extremely dangerous and is a fatality multiplier to merely BASE jumping. I leave you with this, statistically you have a greater chance of being killed driving to a dropzone than you do boarding an airplane only to jump out of it with two parachutes. ",

            "answer_text": "QUESTION: How common are double parachute failures? How common or rare is it that both the parachutes will fail to deploy? ANSWER: Most of the answer has been given by the five people who got to this question before me, but I was asked to answer, so I will add just this observation. As Dave said, parachutes, by design, just \u201cwant\u201d to open and fly. It is very, very rare for a properly-maintained parachute - main or reserve - to fail. I have seen (no kidding) people wearing a parachute system, with an unpacked main parachute, just stuff that parachute into a garbage bag, or simply wad it up and hold it against their chest, then jump from a plane and release the bundle. It opened and flew, and the person landed safely. The two people I saw do this were using old parachutes and didn\u2019t mind if the fabric got friction damage. Most of the care and neatness that jumpers (or professional packers) impose on a main parachute is for the purpose of getting all that fabric into a tight container and having some hope of closing it. The main thing you want, on a consistent basis, is for the lines to not wrap around portions of the canopy, which can result in malfunctions of varying severity and possibly friction burns to a rather expensive piece of textile engineering. When uninformed people talk about a \u201cparachute failure\u201d, it usually occurred because the parachutist was in bad position at opening time. Ideal is to be flat, face-to-earth, and stable. This allows the pilot-chute to pull the parachute out of its container and cleanly off your back, with the lines and employment-assist devices all nicely oriented and coming out in their intended sequence. Second best is to be head-high vertical, or near-vertical when you dump, which has the same advantage as flat-dumb-and-happy except you are falling faster, so the opening will be harder when it happens. Asymmetric positions or tumbling can cause the parachute to come out with uneven line-lengths and tension, causing possible line-overs or one side of the canopy opening before the other, flying around and eating itself. Other pilot-induced problems at deployment can trap the slider (or other deployment-damping device) making it unable to operate, which prevents opening (fully or partially). Reserve parachutes are packed with exquisite care and attention, but if the person using one just separated from a \u201cfailed\u201d main that was gyrating violently, they might not have time (or might be in a panic at that point) to stabilize their fall before they deploy the reserve - or the reserve was deployed by the action of detaching the main - and so again the person\u2019s position/orientation and motion might interfere with a clean deployment. This is why responsible dropzones, clubs, and national organizations insist on a slightly conservative normal deployment altitude. It gives the skydiver time to recognize a problem with the main, and do something about it in deliberate fashion\u2026 which helps ensure the reserve will come out properly and do its job. ",
