            "answer_text": "It goes without saying that this is a morally reprehensible suggestion for two reasons. Slavery is a great moral evil, and assigning slave status on the basis of race is an independent evil. It\u2019s worth answering only because it can clear up some popular misconceptions about slavery. There have been many different types of slavery in the world. I assume you are asking about a system similar to the southern US prior to the Emancipation Proclamation. The purely economic damage done to African-Americans in the US before the Civil War came from racism, not slavery, and was worse in free states than in slave states, and did not go away when slaves were freed. Slavery is terrible for a lot of reasons, but economic deprivation of slaves was not the important one in the 19th century US. The main thing stolen from slaves was freedom and the possibility of future economic betterment, not current economic support. Calling someone a slave does not solve the problem of how to get them to work. If you are legally allowed to beat or kill them, as with galley slaves or some mining slaves or Nazi labor camps, you can force some low-quality work out of them, but they don\u2019t live long under these conditions, and the cost of overseeing and maintaining them is close to the value of the work they produce. This kind of slavery would be economically similar to killing people, their net economic product would become negligible. In the southern US, slaves were motivated by wages, both cash and in kind. Many of them, particularly skilled slaves, lived and worked independently and paid their owners fees. While there were beatings and murders, those did not stop when slavery ended, and people were legally allowed to beat servants as well as slaves at the time. From an economic standpoint, you treat a car you own better than one you rent, so life expectancy and physical care was higher for slaves than for free paid workers, and sometimes higher than for their owners. Therefore, slaves were not cheap labor, especially because you had to buy them and support them throughout their lives, as well as pay them to work. It was cheaper to hire a free person by the day with no responsibility to support his family, or pay for his upbringing or retirement, who you could beat, and replace if you injured him, or fire at zero cost. Slaves were exceptionally efficient labor. A group of slaves running a plantation with a nominal white overseer (who was instructed not to interfere or bother the slaves) was far more productive than the same number of hired hands. This was for the same reason the Israeli kibbutz or the Iroquois and Huron Great Lakes farms or Amish villages or other cooperative self-sufficient agriculture schemes work so well. A defined group of people with no ambitions beyond working the land can do a much better job than day laborers; they have the motivation of owners because the more they produce the better they live, but also the advantages of a cooperative group over an individual. So for this scheme to make economic sense, you would have to organize the slaves in groups that could do work more efficiently than employees, because the slaves would cost more than employees. Assuming you could do that, the economic effect would be similar to the same people had joining cooperative societies\u2014they they all became Hutterian Brethren. The slave owners would demand a share of the production, but this would be considerably less than what free people pay in taxes. The skilled slaves who are more valuable as independent workers than as part of cooperative groups, would continue doing what they are doing now, just paying a fee to their owners. But again, that fee would be less than they had been paying in taxes. So it would have a similar effect as a tax cut for some skilled workers. ",

            "answer_text": "This was an answer to another question, but it applies. If slavery were reinstated today, would you buy a slave? Slavery HAS been reinstated. Only now it's a voluntary system. Think about it-you work hard to basically pay for sustenance and living quarters. I got a very nasty resonses-something along the lines of \u201cWell, today you can quit. You can go anywhere. You don\u2019t have to have a master with you-but other than that, yeah, they are EXACTLY the same.\u201d And this was my rebuttal: Technically, a slave could \u2018quit\u2019 by running away. of course, that would mean leaving friends and family, housing, and food behind. And you would get hunted. Almost exactly the same scenario I would face if I decided not to pay my property taxes and run. Might want to check and see how much of that money you work for is actually yours. General consensus is that over 34% goes to the government-if you add in all of the other taxes-sin, 1812, state, fuel. tire disposal, local, consumption, and what have you-you\u2019ll find that number is closer to 78%. If you check, you will find that leftover 22% frequently this is the same number that plantation managers would figure in for cost of feeding and clothing the slaves. I can document this if you wish. Retirement money-gone-either due to inflation (yet another tax) or to the bank bailouts back in 2008. How do you live? By staying in service to some company and hoping to heck that you don\u2019t outlive your usefulness. I believe that slaves pretty much worked \u2018until death do us part\u2019 as well. (A \u2018mortgage\u2019 is literally a \u2018contract until death\u2019.) Vacations-better have your paperwork in order, citizen. God help you if you have ANY criminal arrest (whether or not the charges were dropped) tied to your passport-you might not get back in. You know that unaccompanied slaves going into town were required to have their papers, right? Clothes-easily the highest quality that China can give-at the cost of jobs. Jobs that were feeding your neighbors, and supplying tax revenue for your schools. Freedom to do whatever you choose? I want to go to Yosemite-oops. Mr. Checkbook says to sit back down if I want to have doors that close, stuff in my fridge, things happen when I hit a light switch, etc. Not much left over after paying for that-you will notice that I didn\u2019t mention a 68\u2033 TV, or 900 channels, or Netflix, or a $700 cell phone, or a Mercedes in that line up. What if I want to march in Washington? And say unpopular things? 1st Amendment has become *some restrictions apply. See for details. How about if I want to go shirtless in a restaurant? Drive faster than the speed limit? (How about if the speed limit isn\u2019t posted? Or somebody decides that I was \u2018driving unsafely\u2019 of \u2018too fast for conditions\u2019?) How about have a cold frothy beer in a government park, or walking down the street? How about play my stereo loudly? Work on my car in the front yard? Walk around my house totally nude with the curtains open? (OK, maybe in this case the government has it right\u2026). But a beer at 9 a.m. Sunday morning? Build a patio without permission? Manager or master-I assure you-EVERY job has a manager/master/- Whether they are payroll, or have the title, or are client/cop/code enforcement you WILL be answering to someone else with VERY little control over the outcome. I am not saying slavery was fun-but it is not as far removed from our lifestyles as we would like to believe. Try to start a business without permission from the state. Or get married. Or drive a car. Or work on one for that matter. Try to get a job without papers. Try to move anywhere, for that matter. Try to have a dog without permission. Collect on Social Security? (You know, the Ponzi scheme that you are FORCED to buy into?) Slaves couldn\u2019t do much without permission-I am seeing a trend\u2026 How about drive your car without insurance-with absolutely NO promise that Insurance will EVER pay out for you or the person you hit/or hit you (This one I know for a fact). Don\u2019t forget the Health Insurance that you are now FORCED to buy-to cover people that didn\u2019t even have to prove that they are a citizen. And said health insurance is under NO obligation to pay for a needed procedure if it decides that the Heath Plan Administrator knows more than your doctor. And get ready to pay a HUGE penalty if you don\u2019t buy the insurance. Watch what happens when YOUR son or daughter is disfigured or killed fighting some pseudo-war in order to protect some politicians investment account. Try to borrow money on a handshake. Try to decide (as a young male) that you don\u2019t WANT to die for your country-so you refuse to sign up for selective service. (during the Civil war slaves were pressed into military service-this is different from now exactly how?) . Try to publicly criticism the president using words that even HINT of violence (and interpretation is huge). Try to send an email with the presidents name and the word \u2018bomb\u2019 in it. try to withdraw your OWN money without ID and papers-and yet when someone hacks your account without either tell me how hard it is to get your money back. See how fast your life ends if the IRS decides that you\u2019ve evaded taxes-and subsequently get every cent frozen so that you can\u2019t even pay a lawyer to defend you. See what happens if a cop decides to frame you for something, or you have a judge send your child to prison so that he can earn an extra $1000 from the prison administrator. See what happens if someone decides you are an enemy non-combatant-you will simply disappear with no reference towards your \u2018rights\u2019. And don\u2019t forget our abortion of an education system-one that was originally set up to teach the immigrants how to read the machines-and how it was further twisted by The Rockefeller Foundation in the early 1900\u2019s into a system that is designed to keep people just smart enough to take orders, stay at their jobs and spend their lives up to their necks in dept-money is really really important; doesn\u2019t it seem a bit strange that there does not exist (that I am aware of) one single class all the way up to high school that teaches one how to manage it? How to invest it wisely? The difference between good debt and bad debt? This is a great country-but people shouldn\u2019t get so blindsided by Mom, apple pie and the flag that we forgot that our \u2018leaders\u2019 are NOT leaders-they are Temporary Employees-and WE are the employers. And we have failed miserably at keeping them from becoming our masters, our rulers, our noble class- who keep crunching the populace further and further by voting themselves and their buddies generous gifts from the public treasury. Much like fire-great servant, horrible master. Our masters don\u2019t use whips or stocks-but they are within arms reach, I assure you. Try bucking the system and see how fast you become educated to this. i ",
