            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know any \u201cgood\u201d. There is lot of bad, e.g: The Soviet authorities, having gained control over Estonia, immediately imposed a regime of terror. During the first year of Soviet occupation (1940\u20131941) over 8,000 people, including most of the country's leading politicians and military officers, were arrested. About 2,200 of the arrested were executed in Estonia, while most of the others were moved to Gulag prison camps in Russia, from where very few were later able to return alive. On 14 June 1941, when mass deportations took place simultaneously in all three Baltic countries, about 10,000 Estonian civilians were deported to Siberia and other remote areas of the Soviet Union, where nearly half of them later perished. Of the 32,100 Estonian men who were forcibly relocated to Russia under the pretext of mobilisation into the Soviet army after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, nearly 40 percent died within the next year in the so-called \"labour battalions\" of hunger, cold and overworking. During the first Soviet occupation of 1940\u201341 about 500 Jews were deported to Siberia. History of Estonia - Wikipedia Political repressions followed with mass deportations of around 130,000 citizens carried out by the Soviets.[3]:48 The Serov Instructions, \"On the Procedure for carrying out the Deportation of Anti-Soviet Elements from Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia\", contained detailed procedures and protocols to observe in the deportation of Baltic nationals. Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940) - Wikipedia And somebody says soon: Wikipedia is not reliable, but there is ovet 100 sources! Read those. Finland is very similar to Baltic countries. If you compare Finland and Baltic countries about 1990, when they started to come independent, you can notice that EVERYTHING was much better at Finland. Finland is not so excellent, that is not reason, but but they did not have occupation. Before 1939 Baltic countries were more developed than Finland. They had more influence from Middle-Europe etc. Answer: Soviet Union do more harm than good since there were no good at all. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, The USSR did far more harm than good in the Baltic States as well as in every other country the Soviets occupied. The USSR was like a vampire sucking the life and wealth out of every nation in their sphere of influence and bringing that wealth back to Moscow for the benefit of a very few elite Party members and their friends. If the Soviet Union had been so great and wonderful they would have allowed free travel to all non Soviet countries. Having said that. There were some benefits the Soviet government brought to the Baltics. New factories, thousands of apartment buildings so everyone could have their own apartment. Some good roads, especially in Lithuania, good and free education. There was also less ethnic tension out of fear rather than real acceptance. Some of my family members look back on Soviet times with fondness. Friendships, school, jobs for everyone, nice movies and music. But the filter of nostalgia is often not as clear as reality. For most people, Soviet times were a nightmare in the occupied countries and in Russia itself. I worked in Moscow in the 80\u2019s and remember the nightmare well. I have some fond memories but it was not a life I would want to repeat. ",
