            "answer_text": "It depends, would be my answer. It is an absolutely stunning historical site in an unmatched physical location. You can\u2019t turn your head without seeing something jawdropping. For me, the being there at sunrise was not really a thing - but I live on the edge of the prairie and see sunrises almost every day that would knock your socks off, so seeing the sun come up over a mountain didn\u2019t mean as much to me. The way it works is you get up way too early, climb onto one of a series of buses in the dark and go up a terrifying switchback road, and push your way through the crowd to see the sunrise. It\u2019s the only place I\u2019ve ever gone where being there early isn\u2019t an asset. Second, there are a lot of people. But it\u2019s a big site, and once you\u2019re through the gates I never felt crowded. There is the option of the three day walk through the mountains, arriving at daybreak. I can\u2019t speak to that, because I have some physical limitations that preclude that sort of trip, plus I would have been terrified of falling about half the time. I\u2019m confident that is a different experience than just getting on a bus and riding to the top. Overrated? I believe there is a trend that anything a bunch of people want to see makes it by definition not worth seeing. Not so long ago I saw a travel article about visiting Florence and it suggested skipping The David. That sort of thing is just stupid - if people have been entranced by something for hundreds of years, there is probably a reason. The only problem with going to a popular tourist site is that it\u2019s a little harder to make a real human connection with the people there - more often than not a tourist is just seen as a dollar bill dispenser and you need to fight past that. Go to Machu Picchu. I can\u2019t imagine regretting it. ",

Some things are the same: the incredible view, the awe I feel looking at these structures built so high up, the deep green land, bright blue sky, and brilliant white clouds contrasting with the grey stones, and the llamas cropping the grass. Some things have changed: more excavation has revealed how and where the stones came from, improvement in the conservation of the site has stabilized it, and the methods of getting to the site have been improved. But some things haven\u2019t. It is an important part of human history, showing us what we can do with our minds and muscles if we want, but still living in harmony with nature. ",
