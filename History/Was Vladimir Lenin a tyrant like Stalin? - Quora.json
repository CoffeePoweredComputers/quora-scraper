            "answer_text": "Yes, but not as bad as Stalin. Lenin was more committed to social justice & other far left principles while Stalin tended to virtue signal or to pretend he cared about it. Lenin allowed some private property & market mechanisms to flourished while Stalin quashed them. Lenin allowed L.G.B.T.Q.I.A.+ people, women & ethnic/religious/racial minorities to flourish proud in the open. Stalin quashed them & persecuted them. Stalin ordered population transfers of entire ethnic groups to specific areas into GULAGs for alleged NAZI ties. Stalin purged most of the old Bolsheviks for fear that they could take away his power. Lenin tended to tolerate some disagreement as long as they were not anarchists or entirely opposed to his regime. Stalin never tolerated disagreement & imprisoned & killed people often based upon trumped up charges which were even pushed by quotas on how many people to kill. Lenin did not have as much of a personality cult as Stalin did; Stalin\u2019s personality cult was extremely widespread & tended to portray him as if he were a God or the Soviet Union\u2019s savior.

Here is why the revolution in Russia in the end failed and why Stalin resorted to totalitarianism: Why-did-socialism-fail-in-Russia/answer/Rosa-Lichtenstein Lenin: The Original Dictator? In Defence of Lenin and the October Revolution ============================ Whenever I post anything about Marx, Marxism, communism, or socialism, right-wing Quorans pile into me about the \u2018evils of communism\u2019, as if I haven\u2019t heard this a thousand times already, or as if they were the very first to make that point. In order to forestall the seemingly inevitable, and to save me having to make the same points over and over again in response, such irate individuals are encouraged to follow the above links for my pre-emptive answer. Abusive Quorans and time-wasters will have their posts deleted and will be blocked. I am tired of being patient with such individuals and with having to be all sweetness and light in return. Some complain that this is censorship; it isn't. It is to remind such individuals that if they can't be bothered to read and then reply to my actual arguments (follow the links above), they can't expect me to listen to them in return. Those who want to be civil and argue like grown-ups will, of course, be listened to. I don't issue second warnings. ",
