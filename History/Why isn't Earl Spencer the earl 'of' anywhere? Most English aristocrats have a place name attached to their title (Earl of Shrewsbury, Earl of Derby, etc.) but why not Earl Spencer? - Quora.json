            "answer_text": "Historically, the lowest rank of peers, the barons, hardly ever had a title with a place name: their titles reflected the family name. A few take the form Baron X of Y, and a few of the very oldest have the form Baron de X (which generally predates the use of family names). The senior peers, the Dukes, have always used a place name as a title. The oldest earldoms also used place names, but from the 18th century some started to use family names, sometimes with the addition of a place name in the form Earl X of Y. Earl Spencer was actually the fourth to take that form - and it became more common in the 19th and 20th centuries. Those elevated to the peerage, or promoted within it, have usually been given some say in which titles they took, and it probably reflects an increasing pride in a historic family name. ",
