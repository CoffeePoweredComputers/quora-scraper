            "answer_text": "What idol did Prophet Muhammad not break? Christians were labeled as Easter Worshipers.What about Muslims who revere the Black stone? Touched, bowed down and even kissed?  We can safely say that they are \u201cBlack stone worshipers\u201d. Offensive as it is, it is. The idol that Muhammad failed to removed was first, Himself (his likes & dislikes)Black Stone(Muslim / Imam kissed the stone)  (Pope, kissed statue of baby Jesus)  Can you see the difference?  3 \u201cYou shall have no other gods before me. 4 \u201cYou shall not make for yourself an image (object) in the form of ANYTHING in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. 5 You shall NOT bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God\u2026 ~ Exodus 20 : 3\u20135 It other words, don\u2019t even ATTEMPT to make one. Bowing down is an act of worship.  In every angle, it STILL falls in the category of Idolatry. Idolatry - is an act of worship to an idol. Idol - something you replace God with your - status, money, desire and a person you revere. And even object that you believe that will intercede for you to God Himself.
