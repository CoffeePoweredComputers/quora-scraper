            "answer_text": " This is a piece of basalt formed into to a simple wedge for chopping and scraping. It's about two million years old, from the Olduvai gorge in what is now Tanzania. It looks like it might just be a conveniently shaped rock, but detailed analysis shows evidence that it was chipped into that shape with regular hard impacts from another rock. Although this is the oldest one in the BM, other similar tools have been found in modern day Ethiopia that are about 2.6 million years old. The oldest decorative item in the museum is also an chopping tool like this. It is much better made, and very large. In fact its so large it would be very impractical to use, and for this reason was thought to be symbolic or decorative in nature. It dates from about 1.5 million years ago. ",

            "answer_text": "A two million year old stone tool from olduvai gouge in Tanzania. The museum is actually older than America, 17 years older, and it was almost housed in Buckingham house, before the king decided to rebuild it as a palace. It got so big that the National library and National History museum were re-housed in separate buildings, thus before the National History moved to Kensington, the oldest objectbwas a 27 million year old lump of schist from the Isle of Lewis.
