            "answer_text": " Talleyrand was an intelligent and farsighted individual with a good knowledge of history, diplomacy and statecraft, even though he was corrupt. He wanted Napoleon to establish his dynasty on negotiated agreements, treaties, diplomacy, sound economic policies and a reasonable political arrangement rather than trying to control all of Europe, fighting one battle after the next, believing power depended solely on military victories and acting in a dictatorial manner. Talleyrand had to obey Napoleon and suck up to him. Talleyrand was partly lame and may have resented Napoleon\u2019s vigor. Talleyrand saw Napoleon\u2019s unlimited ambition as a problem. Talleyrand cautioned against invading Spain and Russia, thought France had reached the limit of its expansion, and wanted Napoleon to be less severe on defeated foes. Napoleon would not take Talleyrand\u2019s advice, and fired Talleyrand, calling him \u201cshit in a silk stocking.\u201d Talleyrand knew Napoleon was leading France down the wrong path. He also knew that Napoleon would not listen to reason, was a born fighter who relied on military victories to get ahead and who would cause many Frenchmen and Europeans to die. Talleyrand lasted while Napoleon burned out. Talleyrand had to accept Napoleon even though he knew better what would help France in the long run. ",

Talleyrand served as foreign minister for all governments; Jacobin, the Consulate, the Empire, and the restored Kingdom, without ever being on the wrong side. He continually plotted with Bernadotte and Fouche against Napoleon, sometimes idly, others more seriously. He also disagreed with Napoleon on key policy such as the shooting of the Duc D\u2019Enghien and the invasion of Russia and Spain. ",
