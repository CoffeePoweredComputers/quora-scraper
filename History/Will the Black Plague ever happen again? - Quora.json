            "answer_text": "It won't become a pandemic the way it was in the 16th century, as we have sanitation systems in place that prevent the public health risks people faced at that time. That said, people do occasionally still contract bubonic plague. There is currently a reported case of infection in northern Arizona, And my Uncle was actually the 1st reported case in medical history of a patient who survived all 4 stages of bubonic plague infection. Now he lost several digits to buboes, and was in a coma for awhile, but he ended up pulling through. You can Google it-his name is Steve Gaylord, and he lives in CA. He contracted the plague by trying to fish a mouse that his chat was choking on out of its throat- he was cut or scratched somehow in the process, and that was all it took. ",

            "answer_text": "The Black Plauge never happened. Neither did the Black Plow. The Black Plague happened, and it could happen again because rats are everywhere, and other than hyenas, they happen to be the biggest problem on the planet today, which is why they are known as vermin. Rats frequent places like East Somerville, Massachusetts, Brockton, Massachusetts, and East Saint Louis, Illinois. If the Black Plague were to start again, it would happen in one of these three locations. The one piece of advice which I would like to share with everybody on the planet would be to beware of flea infested rats. ",
