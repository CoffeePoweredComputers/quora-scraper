            "answer_text": "Hello there, That\u2019s a list \ud83e\udd23not a single type\u2026 There are so many greats in the world of military aviation, and its terribly hard to pick one. Do we go hot rod fighter, bomber, or do we look at trainers, transports, helicopters ? There were a lot during that period\u2026and then we get to prototype systems, some of which were greats just for existing. Considering the period 1960\u20131970, I suppose I have to pick one \u2026 And before you say \u2018Oh, you are cheating!\u2019 NO , I am not - this aircraft was produced from 1969 to 1991, and therefore is eligible. Here is it is - sweetie darling - the one, the only\u2026.  Grumman F-14 Tomcat ! OK, so it flew in 1970 for the first time, but it was designed and built in prototype form in the late 1960\u2019s, from 1967 to 1969 - fast work in terms of a development time for a super-fighter. We need to remember that all the \u2018greats\u2019 of the 1960\u2019s in service were most often designed and built during the 1950\u2019s, with a few exceptions e.g. the YF-12. Of the 1960\u2019s types, the numbers were fewer. Some were protracted in their development enough to be considered 1970\u2019s designs, which is fair. But the Tomcat just squeaks in as a 1960\u2019s design - and if pressed I would say it is my favourite from the period, in terms of being successful, for its form, for its power, and for all that it did.  But there are so many others\u2026.  The Mirage IIIEZ for instance\u2026  the Mirage G  The TSR 2  Atlas-Aermacchi Impala \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.  And many besides. I know I have cheated a little, but the F-14 Tomcat most definitely squeaks in as my favourite aircraft of the 1960\u2019s in terms of development and point of time of creation. My 2c worth, very much, and kind regards.  Reference : Grumman F-14 Tomcat - Wikipedia ",

The Air National Guard base near my had F101 Voodoos on duty at all times in case nuclear bombers from the Soviet Union arrived. The F101 Voodoo was armed with two nuclear tipped rockets. Not missiles, just rockets. They drilled aligning towards a flight of bombers then firing their rockets. Firing nuclear tipped rockets. Over CANADA. As an opening volley of a global thermonuclear war. At some point someone was so desperate they thought this might be a good idea. ",
