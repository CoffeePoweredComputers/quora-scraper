            "answer_text": "Simple answer: Both. Ancient Greeks thought of themselves as Athenian, Macedonian, Syracusian, Theban, Ionian, etc., as a mater of Nationality - e.g. my country is the city and surrounding areas of Athens. In parallel, Ancient Greeks thought of themselves as Greek (Hellene/Helinas/\u0388\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2) as a mater of Ethnicity. An example would be a Greek living in the United States. He/she may be an American by nationality, but ethnically is Greek. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about this topic (which has shades of complexity), there is a fantastic book by the Harvard Center for Hellenic Studies: Ancient Perceptions of Greek Ethnicity ",

            "answer_text": "I am sure you did not read Homer\u2019s Odyssey, for\u2026had you read it will come across many passages that when he refers to the Greeks collectively he often uses the words <<Danae>> or <<PanHellens>>. We all know that Hommer\u2019s Odyssey describes the Trojan war fought many thousands of years ago between the Greeks and Trojans at the time when Mycenae was at the pick of their power. long before Athens was established as the supreme city state in the Hellenic world. On individual terms, he refers to them by their tribal name or their place of origins such as <<Argites>> meaning the people from Argos or Melelaos of Sparta, Odysseus of Ithaca. When referencing to the followers of Achilles, par examples he refers to them as the <<mirmidons>> this is not derived by their origin but from their tribal name. What we need to have in mind is that the Greeks of antiquity were tribal people whose loyalty was to their city and their King and often fought each other mainly over land issues but at the same time knew that all were the same nation, had the same customs and traditions and although spoke different dialects it eas the same Greek language. This exists even to our days. The Cypriots par example speak in their own (Cypriot) dialect of the Greek language same for the Cretans, the Pontious (people from Pontus, the area of the black sea) the Grecians ( south Italy) etc. ",
