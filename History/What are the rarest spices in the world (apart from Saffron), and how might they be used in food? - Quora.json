            "answer_text": "It's hard to find a rare spice, because a spice can be rare in one region and common in another. Also these days, we have found ways to cultivate and grow plants in anytime of year. Saffron is dubbed rare because it takes a lot of effort to harvest. The stigma has to be manually picked from the flower. I can name a few other spices that can be considered rare to some SUMAC I put this as rare because in the western part of the world sumac is considered to be a poisonous plant. In the Middle East however, this spice is widely used in dishes. It adds a tangy sour taste to dishes and is usually added to salads and a top meats and rice.MAHLAB This is a spice that is also quite expensive. It is mostly found used in middle eastern desserts. It has a nutty flavour to it. It is also difficult to harvest as it is a kernal found inside of a cherry seedDRIED LIME this is exactly as it states it's a whole like fully dried. Turns out looking like a hard black / blonde ball (the size of a ping pong ball). It has a a distinguished taste from the lime itself. Somewhat earthy in flavour.MACE I added this because we all know a part of this plant that is quite common. Nutmeg is the seed and mace is the outer peel. It is also harvested manually, which means it requires effort and time. Mace has a similar taste to nutmeg, but a little more peppery.BLACK CARDAMOM we know of cardamom, but black cardamom is totally different and sometimes More expensive in price.ANAR SEED also known as dried pomegranate seeds. This spice gives a sour flavour to dishes (much like sumac) help enhance flavour of some foods and giving them depth.AMCHUR POWDER this is simply dried mango powder.PIPAL PEPPER Also known as long pepper. Was used often in the past, but black pepper has gained popularity. Long pepper has a similar flavour to black pepper but with less of a kick (less heat and more sweet flavour to it)Kind of like a mix of black pepper and allspice and cinnamonGALANGAL quite common in regions like Thailand, this spice is a root, similar to ginger. It has a close taste to ginger, but less tangy and spicy and more floral in taste.",

            "answer_text": "I believe even Vanilla is quite labour intensive, very hard to maintain and obviously very expensive. It's also seasonal which makes it super rare. It's almost close to impossible to grow vanilla unless you hand pollinate the flowers every morning at the certain time. This is a piece of information from some coffee, cardamom and pepper planters in South India that have tried to cultivate vanilla before and had to stop because of expenses and too many difficulties. The weather in most places is not at all suited to help vanilla harvesting. When you buy vanilla ice cream it's often flavoured artificially. Unless you can see the black dots (seeds) mixed in with your ice cream, it may or may not be genuine vanilla flavour. Always look for natural vanilla. The flavour is just beautiful, but it's also quite expensive. ",
