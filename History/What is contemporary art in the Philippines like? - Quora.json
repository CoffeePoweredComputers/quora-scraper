            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a very active art and music scene here. I recently visited Angono, the \u201cart capital of the Philippines\u201d which is in Rizal, considered the cultural capital of the islands. There are a number of galleries and museums in Angono and elsewhere. The Laguna region also has several graphic artists, indie komiks writers and artists and there\u2019s a \u201czine scene\u201d (self published magazine) that\u2019s very lively with several conferences per year.  I have met a handful of indie komiks artists and authors when I visited the Komikon Grande festival in Pasig last November. Malantot by Iya Regalario, JV Tanjuatco\u2019s Mythopolis, everything I\u2019ve read by Lady Storykeeper, there\u2019s so much great work coming out of the Filipino indie komiks and zine scene that I\u2019ve seen so far and still getting into it.  If you\u2019re going to visit and interested in the art scene, there are many galleries and museums in Metro-Manila, but make sure to check out Angono, Rizal as well. You can check out the art and sculptures in Balaw-Balaw or Nemiranda Arthouse while you wait on food if, like me, you love eating as much as feasting on beautiful art. If you get down around the Higantes festival in November you can also see the gigantic papier mache \u201cpuppets\u201d (so large they\u2019re operated from inside like a reverse marionette). The artist who founded Balaw Balaw restaurant and gallery is also the one who spearheaded the revival of traditional Higantes parade festival in the 80\u2019s as well. I got a chance to talk to his son during my trip to Angono last year.  ",

            "answer_text": "2 of the most known Filipino artist in the Philippines are Fernando Amorsolo and Malang Manansala. They are considered national artists. Amorsolo: my personal favorite. His works usually depicts the typical Filipino farm life, the beauty of the Philippine countryside, the honor of work, and women.             Manansala: whereas Amorsolo depicts the farm life, Manansala depicts the street life of the poor.         ",
