            "answer_text": "Yes, Hannibal did in fact lose a battle. To be More precise, he lost the Battle of Zama, fought in 202 BC in what was then Carthage but what is now Tunisia. After Hannibal\u2019s famous march over the Alps with his War Elephants, he proceeded to spend the next few years giving any Roman Army that dared oppose him a savage kicking. He led one Roman army into a trap at the Battle of the Trebia, ambushed and outflanked another at Lake Trasimene, and encircled and annihilated a third at Cannae. By this point the Romans finally figured out that maybe throwing armies at Hannibal was not the best idea. They adopted the Fabian strategy, named after its inventor Quintus Fabius Maximus Verricossus, which consisted of following Hannibal around at a safe distance, taunting him and waiting for him to wear himself out. Meanwhile, the Romans sent an expeditionary force to Iberia, then under Carthagianian rule, under the command of Publius Cornelius Scipio, who kicked the Carthaginians out of Iberia before moving on to Carthage itself. With their best general in Italy, the Carthaginians were forced to make peace. However, they recalled Hannibal back to Carthage and then deliberately broke the peace terms. Which led to the final confrontation between the Carthaginians, 40,000 men led by Hannibal, and the 35,000 Romans led by Scipio. The Romans had a big advantage though; They had managed to convince Numidia, suppliers of quality cavalry to the Carthaginians, to switch sides and join them; consequently Scipio had Numidian cavalry at his disposal and Hannibal didn\u2019t. Hannibal did have War Elephants though, and sent them at the Roman lines. The Romans had learnt how to deal with them and simply opened their lines, allowing the elephants to pass through harmlessly, before dealing with them safely in the Roman rear. The Roman cavalry with their new Numidian allies attacked and defeated the Carthaginian cavalry, while the opposing infantry fought brutally. The Battle was eventually decided when the Roman and Numidian cavalry returned from chasing away the Carthaginian cavalrymen and smashed straight into the Carthaginian rear. The Romans lost 5,000 men dead while the Carthaginians had four times that number killed. The war was lost, and Scipio was far less inclined to be lenient to Carthage now. Consequently, he imposed humiliating peace terms on them, reducing Carthage to a mere vassal state of Rome until it was razed to the ground completely in the aftermath of the Third Punic War 60 years later. Hannibal didn\u2019t die at Zama though; he was exiled from Carthage and poisoned himself 20 years later after somebody betrayed him to the Romans. (I apologise if there is any mistakes, I tried to correct as much as possible but there was something wrong with my bloody phone keyboard today). ",
