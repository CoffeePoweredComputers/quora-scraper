            "answer_text": "Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes had the greatest chins in the history of heavyweight championship boxing, Louis did not and was knocked out by a very good boxer in the form of Max Schmeling, Max wouldn`t have even been able to hurt Holmes or Ali. Louis was open to right hands at the time he lost to Schmeling but he fixed this defensive problem by the time he destroyed Schmeling in their famous rematch, Holmes may have had a great chin but the reason why experts know this is because he was himself very easy to hit with right hands, Louis was far better defensively than Holmes, so I would rate Louis above Larry. Ali was harder to hit than Holmes because he would stand on the edge of punching range where he could simply move his head slightly to evade a punch while staying in range and throw really fast counters, Ezzard Charles had a great defense also and was better than Louis when they met as Joe was coming to the end of his reign, a younger Joe would have landed more punches but it still would have been a great fight. Rocky Marciano beat Louis when he was way past it, again a younger Louis would have been dangerous for Rocky but even in his prime Louis didn`t like fighting swarmers, out of all the names above you could find the greatest heavyweight of all time except for Schmeling because Louis destroyed him in their rematch, but Max was still one hell of a fighter and Louis`s display on that day may be the fight that proved he really was the greatest heavy of all time, I hope this little tit bit helps.

            "answer_text": "At his absolute best you could never discount Mike Tyson when discussing the best Heavyweight of all time. In his prime he was as strong as a bull, was exceptionally quick with his hands and body movement and had concussive power in both hands whilst being able to take the most powerful shots of his opponents. Couple this with his ability to slip shots and counter with rapid power combinations he was totally formidable opponent indeed. I can\u2019t think of anyone that would have relished fighting Tyson in his prime. ",
