            "answer_text": "Some of the more interesting details from the books that I read: Marshal Georgy Zhukov: After seeing Zhukov at the Victory Parade in Berlin on September 7, 1945, General George Patton wrote to his wife describing the Soviet Marshal: \u201cHe was in full-dress uniform much like comic opera and covered with medals. He is short, rather fat, and has a prehensile chin like an ape but good, blue eyes.\u201d (6)In 1963, when author Cornelius Ryan wrote the book \u201cThe last battle\u201d about the battle of Berlin, he came to the Soviet Union and was granted access to Soviet military archives, make copies and take them out of the country. He was also allowed to meet and interview anyone who had taken part in the battle, from privates to Marshals (Rokossovsky, Konev, etc.), except for Zhukov. (5)Marshal Konstantin K. Rokossovksy: Accused of being a spy for Poland and Japan, Rokossovsky was imprisoned for two and a half years during Stalin\u2019s Great Purge. Despite being tortured, he flatly refused to confess to the crimes he had not committed and never informed on his colleagues. He was finally released in 1940 and restored to his former rank. (Details here)While he was in prison, his wife chose to suffer all the hardships of being the wife of an \u201cenemy of the people\u201d rather than renouncing her husband. (1)While doing research to write his book, Dr. Boris Sokolov was unable to find a single order regarding the shooting of specific officers under Rokossovsky\u2019s command, whereas an ample number of such orders over Zhukov\u2019s signature or those of other \u201cMarshals of Victory\u201d have been preserved. The author, therefore, concluded that Rokossovsky was the most humane of all the Soviet military commanders. (1)General Semyon Bogdanov - Commander of the 2nd Guards Tank Army: Like Marshal Rokossovsky, General Bogdanov was also victimized by Stalin\u2019s Great Purge. Arrested in May 1938, he was imprisoned and tortured for over a year before being released in October 1939.On the 8th of May 1945, Bogdanov arrived early at the German surrender ceremony and mistakenly sat on a seat reserved for the German delegation. A staff officer whispered in his ears and he \u201cjumped up, literally as if stung by a snake.\u201d (3)Marshal Ivan Konev On the first day of the battle of Berlin (16th of April 1945), a sniper\u2019s bullet hit the tripod of Konev\u2019s artillery glasses, only inches away from his head. (5)Konev was a voracious reader. He kept a small library at his headquarters and occasionally surprised his staff by quoting passages from Turgenev and Pushkin. (5)Konev started his military career as an artilleryman and was a poor horseback rider. Therefore, he was in no way able to lead the Victory Parade in Red Square, June 1945. (By comparison, Rokossovsky and Zhukov started their career in the cavalry and were allowed to lead the Parade) (1) - A relevant, interesting story hereIn January 1945, troops of Konev\u2019s 1st Ukrainian Front liberated the infamous Auschwitz concentration camp - the largest Nazi camp in existence. Konev was nearby but decided not to visit the camp because he was afraid the horror would affect his military judgements. In his own words: \u201cI had already received the first reports of what that camp was actually like. It was not that I did not want to see that death camp with my own eyes; I simply made up my mind not to see it. The combat operations were in full swing, and to command them was such a strain that I could find neither the time nor justification for abandoning myself to my own emotions. (7)General Ivan Fedyuninsky - Commander of the 2nd Shock Army (after the infamous Andrey Vlasov had surrendered to the Germans) Fedyuninsky was wounded 4 time during the Second World War, every time it happened on the 20th of the month. Near the end of the war, he never went out of his headquarters on that day. (3)While stationed near Leningrad, he had experienced first hand the unspeakable privations during the brutal 900-day siege of the city. When the fighting reached German soil in 1945, most Soviet commanders simply turned a blind eye toward their men\u2019s behavior but Fedyuninsky didn\u2019t want the the looted resources to be squandered. So he specifically ordered his men to load German livestock, sugar, rice, etc. on to trains which were sent to Leningrad to compensate its citizens for all their sufferings during the siege. (3)General Alexander Rodimtsev - commander of the 13th Guards Rifle Division at Stalingrad. He was personally brave and greatly respected by his troops who claimed that their greatest fear if wounded was of a transfer to another formation when passed fit for duty. (2)Rodimtsev crossed the Volga to Stalingrad together with his men on the 14 September 1942. When they were ashore, Rodimtsev and 5 staff officers ran for half a mile, under intense artillery fire, to General Chuikov\u2019s headquarters. In that brief journey, German shells killed three of his companions. Rodimtsev was covered in dirt but luckily unharmed. (4)From left to right: General Bogdanov, Fedyuninsky and Rodimtsev.  General Vasily Chuikov - Commander of the 62nd Army at Stalingrad: During the battle of Stalingrad, Chuikov suffered from severe stress-induced eczema and his hands had to be bandaged to absorb oozing lesions on his fingers. (4)Toward the end of the battle, Chuikov crossed to the east bank of the Volga to attend a party. On his return, the drunken general fell through a hole in the ice and had to be fished out of the freezing water. (2)Sources: (1) Boris Sokolov, \u2018Marshal K.K.

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, one of, or perhap the finest Soviet general, is also one of the least remembered - by Americans, at least: \"Aleksandr Mikhaylovich Vasilevsky (\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0301\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0301\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439) Aleksandr Vasilevsky. His finest achievement was the final major campaign of WWII, which in fact triggered the Japanese surrender decision (not the Nagasaki atom bomb) - Soviet invasion of Manchuria. \"The Far East Command, under Marshal of the Soviet Union Aleksandr Vasilevsky, had a plan to conquer Manchuria that was simple but huge in scale, calling for a massive pincer movement over all of Manchuria. This was to be performed by the Transbaikal Front from the west and by the 1st Far Eastern Front from the east; the 2nd Far Eastern Front was to attack the center of the pocket from the north. The only Soviet equivalent of a theater command that operated during the war (apart from the short-lived 1941 \u201cDirections\u201d in the west), Far East Command, consisted of three Red Army fronts.\u201d I cover this in detail, here: If you were to pick one general from history to command your military, who would you pick? Nevertheless, I also am a longtime admirer of General Rokossovsky Konstantin Rokossovsky. While other contributors have illuminated the career of this exceptional general, I would add a small, but perhaps something worthy of remembering, for both Americans and perhaps for Russians. WWII is so remote, that youngsters today forget the considerable sincere good will, particularly between the working people of both countries, during those very dark years. Sitting today in heated apartments, enjoying nutritious, warm and tasty meals, surfing the Internet on their computers, they cannot imagine the fact that WWII was such a close, desperate matter, or how ghastly (often) were the experiences of family servicemen (and women: How did the Soviet T-34's outmaneuver the technologically superior German Panzer tanks?) in combat, or that their parents could actually have even been on the losing side. (I recently read a Russian army veteran\u2019s comment that the smell of rotting flesh was everywhere strong, even 10 miles from the front lines.) The actual outcome of WWII was the result of truly dedicated, allied cooperation, from millions of ordinary working class people across the world, with all its inevitable failings and disappointments. There exists in Moscow, open today, a Unique Lend Lease Museum In Moscow. Among its many interesting exhibition articles (many (most?) donated from personal Russian collections) sits General Rokossovsky\u2019s personal Lend Lease jeep - still in operating order. Russians are not alone in understanding, and respecting the essential contributions made to allied victory, by people on the opposite side of the world, people whom then, they could never meet, or even communicate with - no Internet during their lifetimes. Their counterparts had the same problem, but they also remember: the Ira G. Ross Aerospace Museum, in Niagara Falls, NY. The museum contains a Soviet Lend lease P-39, recovered from Russia in 2009.
