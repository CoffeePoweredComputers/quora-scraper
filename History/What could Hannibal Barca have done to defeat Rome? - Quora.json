            "answer_text": "The question: How could Hannibal have succeeded in destroying Rome? He would have needed to think like a Roman, and he couldn\u2019t do that even with all of his hatred of Rome. As Hu Jinqin states in his answer, Hannibal\u2019s intention was to beat Rome in battle so badly that it would sue for peace on favorable terms. That\u2019s what city-states did back then. They\u2019d fight and when one side started losing badly they\u2019d sue for peace. Except for Rome. Rome was different, very different. For Rome every battle was a fight to the death, and when things went badly, the Roman ideal was to continue fighting. Of course in battle Roman soldiers fled, but the Romans were so embarrassed by the survivors of Cannae that they sent them to Sicily instead of using them to protect Rome from Hannibal. It would take almost 20 years before the survivors had fought valiantly enough to recover from their survival at Cannae. Note: the shame was not in the loss but the fact they didn\u2019t die fighting. To put it bluntly and in modern terms, the Romans were bad-asses. Hannibal should have realized this but he couldn\u2019t think like a Roman. He was too steeped in his own Phoenician culture to really understand that Rome would never capitulate to Carthage. He would have had to destroy Rome almost down to the last man, woman and child - and he lacked the resources to do that with his small force of mercenaries and Gallic allies that survived the trip across the Alps. Cannae offers many lessons to the modern warrior, but one of its most subtle is this failure of Hannibal to \u201cthink like a Roman.\u201d Had he done so I believe he would either have bided his time to amass more troops, then struck at Rome in a more conventional manner - or he would have not attacked Rome at all.  Couldn\u2019t Think Like a Roman His failure stands as a warning for all warriors to work to put aside their own cultural assumptions and try to think completely like the enemy. It remains a challenge and a skill that only a few soldiers attain, but when they do they are almost invincible in the field. Hannibal would meet such a man at Zama, Scipio Africanus, a master of the art who had no problem thinking like his enemy. ",

            "answer_text": "Believe it or not, Hannibal COULD\u2019VE sacked the city. (Wether or not he wouldve succeeded is lost to time) He was the 1st REAL bitch slapping for Rome. He toy\u2019d with them, out thought them, out manuvered them and just straight up out fought them. He showed Rome how indefencless they Work due to roman soldiers being so spread out across the provinces. Rome put every legion they could against Hannibal yet were beaten and quite easily I might add. At one point Hannibal is said to be within 50 miles of Rome herself. Hannibal also did something quite genius, He told his soldiers not to attack any of the senators or aristocrats villas out in the countryside. His soldiers could rape & pillage and do as they pleased. As long as it wasn't in a senator's villa or residence. Why is this simple act of a work of genius ? Because during this time Rome was basically clueless on how to beat Hannibal. Their best legions were just too far to fight so they stalled doing nothing. Standing around doing nothing wasn't the \u201cRoman\u201d thing to do and the general population became uneasy. They chanted marched demanded Rome's elite to do something. After a few months of this is when Hannibal did the already mentioned \u201cact of genius\u201d. He knew Rome was going through turbulence within itself and by simply telling his armies not to touch any of the senators or aristocracies properties. From the Roman public's point of view this looked as if the Senate had struck a deal with Hannibal to leave their belongings alone, yet sold out everybody else. This caused a major riot and now Rome was fighting amongst itself as Hannibal stood in the outskirts up on the hill calmly watching. Rome had to act to calm the people so they sent additional forces that were just not ready for a guy like Hannibal and were all beaten. Rome was almost at its end if Hannibal chose any day to sack Rome that would have been the end of it but a Roman soldier had a smart idea. A man name Scipio marched all the way to Carthage, Hannibal's home city, and sacked it knowing for sure that Hannibal would have to come back to protect it leaving Rome alone. Hannibal was eventually beaten by Scipio and excaped to live years before he would eventually take his own life. But it's interesting to think how Western civilization could have been changed by one man's decision. Hope this helped. SPQR Forever!!! ",
