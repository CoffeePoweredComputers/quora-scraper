            "answer_text": "Why is Ronald Reagan hated so much? This is a real head-scratcher. Reagan made the stupidest white trash on earth feel like they were somebody, and he made almost everyone feel good about America\u2019s prospects. His ability to make suckers feel good about themselves made Reagan a political God. Some suckers wake up. Reagan is coming into disrepute because the effects of his policies, which metastasized into cancers on blue collar Americans, are now acute. The \u2018woke\u2019 parts of blue collar America elected both Obama and Trump, reacting with visceral anger against establishment politicians in both parties. Voodoo economics (aka, supply side or trickle down) are, at the federal government level, tantamount to giving a violent drug addict an unlimited credit card with a balloon payment due at some unknowable future time, and then, after years with no reported crimes by the addict (who now lives peacefully and well accumulating debt) having \u201cexperts\u201d claim the problem of addiction-fueled violence is solved. Voodoo economics (aka, supply side economics) ignores the risks of debt, voodoo economics ALSO ignores the costs of debt, and voodoo economics ignores the congenital debilitating effects of debt. Supply side economics - government policies subsidizing corporations like Amazon and Walmart at the expense of blue collar Americans - effectively sells out working class people to corporations, essentially by billing working class people for the privilege of working for corporations that pay little or no income tax and also get subsidies from government. In 1980 aggregate US federal debt was about $10,000 per person and the population was about 60% of what it is after thirty years of lightly restricted illegal immigration. As of June, 2018, the US per capita debt is $61,000, or about ten times what it was when Reagan\u2019s puppeteers began pulling strings to get Reagan to sign supply side policies into law. Who can say what your share is today? It is the same as every newborn child\u2019s share, that is what we know. If the Chinese successfully attempt to collect on Treasuries, then Reaganomics\u2019 entire house of cards comes tumbling down. Massive debt is the core element of voodoo economics, as are open borders, free trade, and abandoning maintenance of federal highways and bridges because the money that paid those services before Reagan is now paid out in salaries to bloated government and debt service. Inevitable (predictable) results of voodoo economics include decaying infrastructure and the destruction of America\u2019s blue collar middle class. America\u2019s blue collar and low skill workers have not got a pay raise since Reagan. The degeneration of roads, bridges and public utilities is blatantly obvious, as is the lack of industrial capacity in the US today. Another predictable but, given the quality of thinking by Regan, Weinberger, Greenspan et al, unexpected consequence of voodoo economic policies is asset inflation. I am laughing as loud as I cried in the 1980s1990s thinking how the Reagan and Clinton clownshows missed the concept that most debt is secured by assets and that an inevitable result of massive increases in public and private debt is asset inflation. There is more\u2026 all of it maddening. Reagan is under increasing scrutiny because now it is obvious the dimwitted son of a bitch\u2019s handlers fooled so many people so completely by using the amiable old dunce as a prop to divert voters while they enabled selected global entities to loot the US Treasury early and often. I am laughing out loud thinking how establishment media parasites stood in line to support criminals and to calm alarmed Americans during the 2008 crash- and after, when voodoo economics led - twice in six months - to government bailouts of failed global enterprises. Free markets? Is the government picking winners part of a free market economy? Under supply side economic policy, yes, picking winners is a free market system.Capitalism? Is picking winners capitalism? Under supply side economic policy, yes, picking winners is capitalism.Reagan is losing ground because nobody likes to see a fool or an idiot in the mirror. To an increasing number of meritocrats Reagan represents their personal and political stupidity and gullibility. More and more blue collar whites turn away from Trump because the great communicator lied to them before he fucked them, while he fucked them, and after he fucked them. In sum, more people take a dimmer view of Reagan today because more victims of voodoo economic policies have figured out that the great communicator stole goodwill Americans believed they were giving.

            "answer_text": "You forgot that he singlehandedly ended the Cold War (sarcasm!) although curiously it didn't happen until he was out of office. There are several things to understand about President Ronald Reagan and the cultlike admiration of many people even today. First is that many of \u201chis\u201d successes were possible only with the help of others. The stimulus package of tax cuts and spending programs, that was written and passed by a Democratic Congress that worked with, not against, the President. As for the Cold War, there are many individuals who made essential contributions to that effort over a period of decades. Reagan is not one. He just happened to be President during a critical period when the old generation of Soviet leaders died off and a new kind of leader emerged, Mikhail Gorbachev. It\u2019s possible that Reagan might have slowed down the peace process. It\u2019s also important to know that the accomplishments attributed to Reagan came at great cost. The tax cuts and military buildup meant horrendous budget deficits. That's what I'm most angry about, that his stupid Reaganomics led to a huge increase in the national debt that is passed along to future generations. Reagan promised that he could cut taxes, spend more on weapons, and balance the budget. When the first two happened and the third went drastically wrong he just laughed and said that two out of three wasn't bad. My children will the price, literally, because of his foolish priorities. Lastly it must be pointed out that Reagan was a hypocrite and a phony. His words didn't match his actions. He talked about faith and family and morality yet his church life was minimal and mostly for show and he was a poor example of a father. He said that individuals should take care of social services instead of the government yet he gave pitifully little to charity himself. He spoke like a great warrior yet when other actors and celebrities enlisted for combat in WW II he played it safe. The significant military actions during his time included the disasterous Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, when he cut and run following the deaths of 241 Americans, and the highly successful but unnecessary invasion of a postage stamp sized island nation in the Caribbean that few had even heard of. He talked about compassion and yet he refused to address the AIDS crisis because it was mostly homosexuals anyway. He revered the Constitution but then trampled all over it during the bizarre Iran Contra Scandal. He talked about personal responsibility but couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to admit that he lied to his country. You describe Reagan as someone who \u201cbelieve[s] in traditions and conservative values\u201d. He certainly talked a lot about those things, and it's possible that he even believed in them, but he didn't live them. Ask any true fiscal conservative if they think it's fine to borrow bigger sums of money so that you can spend more on fancy gadgets, and then stick your kids with the bill. That is not true conservatism. Over the past 40 years, from Carter to Obama, the most fiscally responsible Presidents are probably Bush I, Clinton, and Obama. And the ironic thing is that Bush got fired for being fiscally responsible. Over the same period the best Presidents in terms of devotion to church and family were probably Carter, Bush II, and Obama. Notice who\u2019s missing. The best thing I can say about Reagan is that when America was feeling pretty bad about itself, he made a lot of people happier and more optimistic. That's something, I guess, but I was never one of those people. ",
