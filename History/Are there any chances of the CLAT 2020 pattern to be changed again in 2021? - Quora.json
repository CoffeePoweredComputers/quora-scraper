            "answer_text": "Hi It\u2019s quite sceptical to say this. Since the paper pattern has changed, it does require a lot of practice but I have seen a lot many aspirants who have started their practices on time without pinning the blame on COVID-19 and studying in this hope, that soon after their Boards, they will writing CLAT in order to get in an NLU. Now, let say that there can be the chances of getting the pattern changed or syllabus can also get curtailed, but until 2020 CLAT happens, no one can straight-up say this. So, just work on your concepts and hope for the best! :) ",
