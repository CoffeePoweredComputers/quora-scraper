            "answer_text": "If you were wounded but not immediately killed most likely you would be maimed in such a way that retreat would be difficult or impossible. If you were still a threat you were expected to fight as an enemy soldier would kill you without hesitation, if you weren't you would probably bleed to death before you got a chance to retreat. Now let's presume you avoid both of those fates for the sake of argument. Your side was victorious in the battle and your wound was crippling like a broken femur but not immediately lethal as your artery wasn't sheared off. Depending on if you were important enough to save like a nobleman second or third in line son they would try to treat your wounds likely by amputation if it was a crippled limb. If not or if the damage was too great you would either be subjected to a mercy kill where your own side finished the job as quick as they could manage or left to die as the damage took its toll. A lot of the details are dependent on Era and location though as different locations had different customs but most often you would either be killed or die of your injuries with an inability to retreat.

Many didn\u2019t make it, it was easy for a disoriented wounded man to get trampled underfoot, and the enemy would generally dispatch any wounded on the ground. Your chances were much better if you were walking wounded and could be helped to the rear by your comrades. Being wounded was a legitimate reason to fall out of formation though, nobody was expected to keep fighting while badly wounded. Having said that, you could be in a lot of trouble if you tried to go to the rear without a wound that had taken you out of the fight. Some armies did maintain full-time medics, but in most cases battlefield medicine was primitive or non-existent. Soldiers would treat a lot of their own injuries and your chances of survival with a serious wound weren\u2019t good. Even if you stopped the bleeding and dressed the wound your chance of dying from infection later was pretty high. ",

            "answer_text": "It was less a problem of permission and more a problem of possibility. These were the days of close order formations meaning as long as you could \u201ckeep on trucking\u201d you were better served by making short work of your enemy and then getting medical attention at your leisure than try to work your way through the press backwards. And if you couldn\u2019t, odds were that you would be trampled into the mud of the battlefield rather make it back to safety. The only exception were cavalry and skirmishers, who actually had the ability to go back and did so if they were no longer combat effective and people considered too important to leave on the field\u2026 though such people frequently refused such chances.
