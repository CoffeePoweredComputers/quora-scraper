            "answer_text": "Politically, Hitler\u2019s absorption of Czechoslovakia unequivocally showed his intentions to the world. While Britain and France\u2019s \u201cappeasement\u201d at the Munich conference arguably emboldened him going forward, Hitler\u2019s follow-up seizure of the rest of the country demonstrated that such a policy couldn\u2019t work, and therefore made inevitable the Allies\u2019 declaration of war after the invasion of Poland. Materially, Western Czechoslovakia (Bohemia and Moravia) had been a major arms and industrial center for the old Austro-Hungarian empire \u2014 Most notably the Skoda and Tatra companies. As Germany was starved for industrial capacity as it built up its armed forces, gaining that production capacity was enormously helpful. The actual arms of the old Czechoslovakian army (Artillery, machine guns, tanks, trucks, and more) as well as new, Czech-designed equipment, were vital to Germany in the early \u201cBlitzkrieg\u201d years, and remained important to the end of the war. Likely the most famous and important Czech-produced item used by the Germans was the LT-38 tank, known in German service as the Panzer 38(t). This was probably the best tank in the world in its weight-class at the time it was introduced, and made up the backbone of the Panzer force during the invasion of France. Though it was quickly outclassed as main battle tanks grew in size, the Germans made use of their chassis for a wide range of self-propelled artillery and tank destroyers through the end of the war. Great Britain also produced and made important use of some Czech-designed arms \u2014 Their standard light machine gun, the \u201cBren\u201d, and a number of mostly tank-mounted rifle caliber and larger machine guns, generally known by the name \u201cBesa\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Czech partisans carried out the only targeted assassination of a top ranking Nazi by the Allies, Reinhard Heydrich. Operation Anthropoid - Wikipedia Heydrich was widely acknowledged at the time and since as both the most capable and the most evil of the top ranking Nazis, Hitler called him \u201cthe man with the iron heart\u201d. Reinhard Heydrich - Wikipedia Had he lived, he couldn\u2019t have changed the final result of the War but I am sure he would in the three further years it lasted have ensured countless more millions died somehow, somewhere through his genius for evil. It\u2019s arguably the most successful Resistance operation of WW2 seen anywhere and the biggest contribution in the War of Czechoslovakia. We should all Saulte the brave Czech partisans who killed Heydrich. ",
