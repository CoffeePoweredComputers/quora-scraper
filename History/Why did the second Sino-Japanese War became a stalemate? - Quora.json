            "answer_text": "Ultimately, because wars need a political solution , and the Japanese never had a working political solution. War is not just about defeating the other side\u2019s armies, to rule over their land, their people would need to agree to it or the fighting would just keep on going . The problem when comparing Japan to say.. the Manchus or the Mongols is that the former (especially the Manchus) more or less ran China the same way as the Han chinese dynasty it replaced (literally.) with only some minor changes and some cultural things they force on. This was enough to get the core population to sign on especially the gentry class . Japan however, never made such attempts, and this was also the 20th century already, and general concept of nation state is even stronger, as such basically none of the puppet government they supported in China ( from Manchukuo to several others.) was seen as legitimate by the local population. Japan\u2019s propaganda of driving out the colonial powers made more sense in say.. SE Asia, but China was already a Republic at the time. and was never truly colonized to the same extend anyway. This seeps back into the military side as Japan never really felt secure enough to go all in on attacking ChongQing for example, it simply could not move their armies unhindered through much of what\u2019s theoretically already conquered lands. when they could not operate logistically once they leave the confines of the Yangtsi River (and some of the coastal areas. ) The Chinese armies were also not idiots, they were quite aware going in that they would not be able to fight strait up with the Japanese at that point, but they had many advantages such as numbers, local support and general defense in depth. The reality is , even the Japanese didn\u2019t trust their puppet states. Machukuo theoretically had an army of 200,000 + , but the Japanese never was willing to put them into the front line, because they are well aware that their loyalties were dubious at best, and thus they never put much resource into it either (and that\u2019s with them owning the region for quiet awhile already.). you\u2019d think that if this was a video game they conquer all these place then they can draw their man power and resource into an even greater war machine, when in reality it cost them even more men and money to keep an eye on and the efficiency of the resource transition was meh at best. Even the Koreans and Taiwanese, whom had been subjugated forever, they were quite unwilling to put their manpower into the war effort until it became desperate, most of the Taiwanese conscripted still worked as porters and not soldiers.

            "answer_text": "China is huge. By huge I mean roughly the same size as all of Europe from the Ural Mountains to the Atlantic. Even if we discount the sparsely populated west, China is much larger than the current day EU, with none of the nautical paths to get around it as much more of the country is deep inland. Couple this fundamental geographical issue with the nonexistent infrastructure in early 20th century China (outside of Manchuria and the Yangtze Delta anyways), and you get a landmass that is nearly impossible to occupy. As a result, while the Germans could quickly move supplies and men around Europe with the continent\u2019s well developed rail lines and roads, the Japanese would have to literally carry all their weapons and supplies on their backs and march over 1,000 miles from a port like Shanghai to the Nationalist capital at Chongqing. All this while fighting a poorly armed but fiercely determined resistance with too many countryside hideouts to realistically crush. On top of this, Japan didn\u2019t have enough soldiers to cover the vast expanse of China. Japanese forces in China never amounted to much more than 1 million men, and of those, half were stationed in Manchuria. 500,000 soldiers simply isn\u2019t enough to police an area larger than Western Europe when the populace is overwhelmingly uncooperative, even with regular bouts of mass slaughter meant to cow them. Continuing to attack into China would mean those men would be spread even thinner, ensuring Chinese guerrillas would have even more free reign in supposedly occupied territory or allowing the regular Nationalist Army to strike elsewhere along the front line. Japan took on too Herculean of a project in conquering a nation as massive as China while their policies of casual brutality certainly didn\u2019t help in making them any local friends. ",
