A person in a state of coma is described as being comatose  A comatose person exhibits a complete absence of wakefulness and is unable to consciously feel, speak, hear, or move.For a patient to maintain consciousness, two important neurological components must function. The first is the cerebral cortex\u2014the gray matter that forms the outer layer of the brain. The other is a structure located in the brainstem, called reticular activating system (RAS). Injury to either or both of these components is sufficient to cause a patient to experience a coma Generally, a person who is unable to voluntarily open the eyes, does not have a sleep-wake cycle, is unresponsive in spite of strong tactile (painful) or verbal stimuli, and who generally scores between 3 and on the Glasgow Coma Scale is considered in a coma ",
