            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Those of us who dislike Reagan dislike him for the following reasons: He embraced the \"greed is good\" philosophy. Reagan made it acceptable for people to be self centered. We no longer have a sense of interconnectedness as a society because of Reagan. We also as a society spend a lot of time worshiping wealth and those that have it in large part because of the economic philosophies and deification of the business/free market  that Reagan ushered in. Rich=good, hardworking, smart, and poor equals=lazy, stupid. This philosophy has resulted in the cruel cuts in our social safety net-after all, if you believe that poor people are lazy, stupid, and are poor because they made bad decisions, it's easier to cut them off and let them fend for themselves. He started the trend of enriching the rich at the expense of the poor. Reagan's tax decreases largely benefited the very richest Americans at the expense of everyone else. Many people are not aware that Reagan raised taxes on the middle class-he hiked the payroll taxes on working Americans and removed deductions from the tax code that middle class Americans largely benefitted from, such as being able to deduct interests on consumer loans. He devalued the role and purpose of government. Reagan took the first giant steps toward discrediting the role of government as a solution to problems. His quip that \"the  scariest words were 'I'm from the government, and I'm here to help'\" made a lot of people laugh and clap, but in reality, his philosophy as embodied in those  words  resulted in a mistrust in the government as an agent of change so large that Republicans nowadays don't even pretend to govern anymore. And Democrats, in order to win elections, have had to incorporate that philosophy as well to some degree-Clinton's statement \"the era of big government is over\" is an explicit acknowledgement of how powerful a grip this philosophy regarding government's role in our society had become. We now have people running for office who don't believe in the government as a tool for crafting the society that we want to have, and that is having far reaching effects on our ability to solve such problems as wealth inequality, poverty, education,  climate change, unemployment, and other issues. To a lesser degree, he continued the Republican party's race problem. Most notably, at his appearance at a rally in Philadelphia, Mississippi, where he stated he was for \"states rights\". Sound innocuous? Well, only if you didn't know that was where four civil rights workers were killed fighting for the right to vote for blacks. Not to mention his lies regarding \"welfare queens\" and \"strong young bucks\" driving Cadillacs around while collecting welfare checks. The Republicans had a race problem prior to Reagan, but he certainly didn't improve it. ",
