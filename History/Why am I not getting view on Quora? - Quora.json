            "answer_text": "Nikhil you\u2019re still new to Quora and have a small answers count (15). You need to build your profile with a lot more content to gain more reachability. I\u2019d suggest you focus on writing quality answers, which don\u2019t necessarily have pictures in them. Follow and pick out topics that interest you and share your knowledge. Try to write well formatted answers and pour your heart out in your writing :) Slowly you will see the views rising. But don\u2019t keep the views/upvotes/followers count as your main objective. Enjoy your stay at Quora. Read answers by other writers. Try to learn from their writing style. Try to better yourself everyday. And you\u2019ll gain alot from this platform. Be patient and keep working at it. P.S: Quora has some rules. Go through them and don\u2019t violate them, else even your best answers might get collapsed. ",
