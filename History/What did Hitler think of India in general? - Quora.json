            "answer_text": "Hitler was quite scornful of them as they were part of the British Empire and he didn\u2019t think of them as true Aryans. The Indian separatist leader who contributed and arranged for Indian troops to serve in the Indian legion with the Germans was told by Hitler that the Germans and Indians were blood brothers, but he said that he would have executed Gandhi for his complaints about the Raj when meeting with the Viceroy. This is more like his feelings. In short, he considered them to be undesirables and a weak, useless Asiatic group that was stupid and worthless for fighting against the superior British. He even was claimed to have said that the British should shoot Gandhi and execute members of the Indian Independence movement while he and the Japanese, who were pushing to India, were going to divide the land after the British were defeated. They didn\u2019t fit his definition of Aryan because they had mixed and mingled with the British and other ethnic groups for years, so they were not racially \u201cpure.\u201d The only reason he talked nicely to Bose was because he needed the men during D-Day. He always was like that when he needed manpower. Quite ironic considering more than 4500 served in both the Wehrmacht and the SS. Not to get too sidetracked but there was also a Free Arabian Legion, which I have always found interesting. Hitler always wanted India to remain under British administration; what got him to form the Indian Legion was Bose\u2019s determination and his shortage of manpower. He was actually impressed by Bose\u2019s intelligence and even allowed him to marry a German woman. Interestingly enough, Heinrich Himmler was fascinated by India and considered them to be \u201cancient white Aryans.\u201d Hitler\u2019s personal view of the nation hardly changed all the way to his death. Aryan = Germany and its allies. Non Aryan = Rest of the World.  ",
