            "answer_text": "Documentary on the annals of Mohyals and my tribute to them:- Mohyal Br\u0101hma\u1e47as were Savar\u1e47\u0101 Sen\u0101 and a paramilitary of \u0100ryas that branched from Saraswats. Post the havoc Ashoka reeked undermining Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism, military-industrial complex of Bh\u0101ratavar\u1e63a, Br\u0101hma\u1e47as did their best to fill the vacuum in power structure by taking up k\u1e63atriya\u1e25 udyoga and numerous Br\u0101hma\u1e47a R\u0101jyas were established within & outside Bh\u0101ratavar\u1e63a. From the time of Paurava the Great who vanquished Alexander's expedition thwarting his aspirations till today Mohyals offer unrelenting service to our M\u0101t\u1e5bubh\u016bm\u012b. Hindu Shahi Dynasty established by Mohyals acted as a fortress of G\u0101ndh\u0101ra resisting Arabs and Gaznavids for three centuries. Mohyals played a pivotal role in the solidification of Sikhism from Bhai Sati Das, Mati Das, Banda Bahadhur assisting Sikh Gurus, becoming hutatma in the process. Mohyals helped consolidate Sikh empire. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as disproportionately represented Swarajya and Swadeshi movements. 70% of the revolutionaries who became amara veeras were Br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Of which Mohyals formed large numbers along with Bengali Brahmins, Chitpavans, Bhumihars, Tyagis. During partition, Mohyals formed militias to rescue the Hindus & Sikhs. Whenever Jihadis spotted Hindu caravans they attacked them but dared not to attack Mohyal's caravans. British would've clubbed Mohyals as Rajputs had it not been for Arya Samaj's intervention. Because British had an hard time fathoming the existence of militant race within Br\u0101hma\u1e47a j\u0101tis since antiquity. 37.7% of officers at Indian Army are Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Mohyals would likely form a large chunk of it. They lend service to the ingrate state and are thriving in various fields because of their no nonsense attitude. This is deeply rooted in the psyche of martial jatis. Secondly jatis that closely-knit together prosper. If you want to learn about of Br\u0101hma\u1e47ic religio-culture, I recommend exhuming Surendranath Dasgupta's 5 vol. compendium---'A history of Indian philosophy' along with Dr. Radhakrishnan's two part---'Indian philosophy'. But if you're looking for k\u1e63atriya\u1e25 exploits of Br\u0101hma\u1e47as look upto Mohyals. Tamil Br\u0101hma\u1e47as don't even have modicum of obstinacy neither do many other Br\u0101hma\u1e47a upaj\u0101tis. In order to survive in this Anti-Br\u0101hma\u1e47ical state surrounded by our enemies, our var\u1e47\u0101 has to imbibe k\u1e63atriya\u1e25tva and arm ourselves with \u015a\u0101stra as well. Afterall Mohyals, Bhumihars, Chitpavans, Tyagis are genetically & Karmically related to us through patrinlineal Sapta\u1e5b\u1e63i ancestry. ",

Banda Singh Bahadur who was a devotee of 10th Sikh Guru Gobind Singh Ji was a Dogra, other Dogras inspired by Banda Singh Bahadur started following Sikhism. Dogras held high positions in Lahore Raj until Punjab was occupied by British in 1849. ",
