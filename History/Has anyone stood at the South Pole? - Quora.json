The actual Geographic South Pole which is the point between the north and south pole which forms the axis the world spins one, and a ceremonial south pole which is 100 or so metres away. The ceremonial pole is a little bit closer to the station so this is the one people tend to get their hero shots at. The geographic south pole has a marker which is moved back to it\u2019s correct position every year since the ice that sits atop the pole gradually slides down towards the ocean. These photos were taken in the middle of summer (January) when it was a mild -45c and yes it is damn cold still. You don\u2019t want your skin uncovered for very long. Geographical South Pole (and it\u2019s marker)   Ceremonial South Pole  ",

Now annually, several hundred people stand by the cerimonial Pole (I read Siple's book about how the reflective globe (an experiment left over) and the barber pole were made). I've been within 400 miles. I was told, should I go back with the USAP, they will wrangle a DV (Distinguished Visitor) seat for me. I said, that's nice but not essential. I go more to the Arctic these days. My friend Thom's photo at the Pole was with a satellite dish which he used to send the first email from Pole. My friend Roxanne got me a Ski South Pole tee shirt: 1/2 inch of powder, 2 miles of base. The USA has a base (Amundsen-Scott Station) as a way to contest the various pie slice claims of other countries. Another couple friends just came back from their civilian (January) visit there using a Russian transport with a Borck Air Twin Otter for the last leg. They took all the usual photos with the ceremonial Pole. ",

Mathematically they were within about 1 nautical mile of the South Geographical Pole. All survived the trek and returned to Norway. ",
