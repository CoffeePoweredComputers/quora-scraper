He is known for, among other things, having unified mathematically the 5 original versions of string theory, by adding one extra spatial dimension, which gave rise to what he called \u201cM - Theory\u201d - the extra spatial dimension creates the possibility of multiple 10 - dimensional universes (9 spatial + time) - like ours, according to string theory\u2019s claim - therefore being a \u201cmultiverse\u201d string theory, that\u2019s my non-physicist-but-Physics-lover\u2019s understanding :-) Dear physicist colleagues, please correct me if needed.
