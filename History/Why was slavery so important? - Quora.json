            "answer_text": "First of all, we need to understand what slavery is - in no way is the invention of evil Europeans, and in the following rows we will explain the origins, evolution and reasons for the existence of such a social category. It must be understood that slavery was not a process belonging to a single ethnic group, often having masters and slaves being part of the same people. Slavery occurred 11,000 years ago during the so-called Neolithic Revolution, when the foundations of agriculture were laid. The slave system evolved massively into large civilizations such as Sumer, Ancient Egypt, Nubia, Ancient China, the Akkadian Empire, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Ancient Greece, India, the Roman Empire, the Arab Caliphate and Sultanate, pre-Columbian civilizations. So until now we have established that slavery has been the basis of society throughout history. Questions are asked, \"Who are the rulers?\" and \"What gives them the right to be master?\". Despite the ideas of contemporary society, various human groups (each defined by a particular race and culture) are not equal, and because of the natural selection that applies to the human society, certain populations are placed above others from different points of view. This approach is applied from small communities, such as tribes, to empires or multi-state alliances. Obviously, there are sometimes factors such as the number of individuals or geographical conditions, or simply luck - things that can change the power ratio in some cases but do not change the overall picture. So, until now we found out that the one who had the right to have slaves was the one who was somehow proven as superior, most often by war. Turning to history, we find out that the blacks became slaves long before the arrival of the Europeans, and that after their arrival there were a large number of blacks who participated as slave sellers or masters. We also find out that Muslim Arabs massively took European Christians as slaves, and the same Arabs took a large number of African blacks as slaves. In the Inca empire, a slave system finds out that it is compulsory to work for one family member, a system later adopted by the Spanish Empire. China, a civilization from which we had incredibly many documents, had slavery regulated by laws from ancient times. The Vikings often had also Western European slaves. The first to start giving up the slave system was the Europeans, starting with Iceland, 1117, Lithuania, 1588, followed shortly by the Japanese, 1590, but without eliminating it altogether. Denmark and Norway abolished slavery in 1803, the United Kingdom and the United States in 1807, gradually followed by all other European nations and not only. The last country to abolish slavery was, ironically, Mauritania in 2007. It is estimated that 17% of the population are still slaves today. And so we come to answer \"Why was slavery so important?\". The answer is incredibly simple. For economic reasons, beyond any justification of superiority. The cheap work handset defines what some people today call neo-slavery. When you have cheap labor, you have products. When you have products, you have money. When you have money, you have power. Although slavery has a long, complicated history, the explanation is not based on the wretchedness of certain social groups but simply on economic and sometimes political reasons which, in their context, make sense to this social system. Obviously, this does not excuse the suffering caused by the masters, especially in modern times, but let us be realistic: and if the roles would be reversed the situation would be the same because it simply mirrors the human society and, to some extent, the nature itself (there are other species that practice some form of slavery like bees or ants).

            "answer_text": "I can only speak upon American slavery as now. So, let\u2019s put it this way. Random white men establish that it\u2019s okay to steal people from their country to work for them because the Bible did it.(Bible Fun Fact: slaves was another word for servant who chose to work for a certain master. Important word: chose). These same men kidnap, rape, torture and kill the non submissive and even the complying Africans before bringing them to America. Hint hint, it\u2019s never okay to split up families and murder. So after they take these guys to America, they make them do hard heavy jobs. This include standing in hot humid temperatures and picking cotton, tending to animals and crops, building and other sorts that\u2019d break the average persons back. This continues for years on years. The First White House and many other historical and neeeded buildings from the early times were built on the backs of slaves. Not only that but food was prepared and sent over by slaves (Another little hint: food and cotton were the prize of the southern economy). This would be okay if 1.) they weren\u2019t slaves and chose to do these things on their own and decided to travel to America, 2.) they received some credit and not just be ignored and still mistreated and 3.) if white men would have helped them a bit more. So to answer your question, slavery is very important to our American history since our economy major economic status was started thanks to them and the work to establish this country was also dramatically helped by them.
