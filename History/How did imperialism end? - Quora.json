            "answer_text": "It didn't. And never will. Imperialism is the policy of extending a country's (or other sovereign states) power through colonisation, millitary power or other means. Imperial policies are as old as governments and human desire themselves. You can see modern examples of imperialism in the news. The best known one is the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation (Russia) in 2014. One that's happening right now is being conducted by China as it builds an over abundance of millitary bases on islands in the South China Sea. The reason they are doing this is to exert their influence over southern Asian nations that have laid claim to the territory of the sea (Which might I add, is Roch in oil and natural gasses; one of the largest underwater deposits in the world). This is in a bid to force them off these islands and allow China to take the claimed resources for themselves. They will often say that this is because of China's historical claim in the region, but really what they're saying is \u201cgive me resources please\u201d. Finally, you might not like it but Israel was created out of imperialism itself as it took over regions in Palestine that sometimes, depending on the source, you can read even find it on a map. ",

            "answer_text": "As Nicholas says, it hasn\u2019t, though it has changed its way of working. The trouble is that \u201cimperialism\u201d varies in its form. There were many land-based empires based on subduing your neighbours, and the great overseas empires often based on direct colonisation of territory occupied by much less technologically advanced people, or, in the case of India, for example, by a clever application of divide and rule. The great colonial empires disappeared for many reasons. The powers weakened each other by fighting each other (and that applies to land-based empires too). The colonised started to organise for freedom, often using ideas that were current in their \u201cmaster\u2019s\u201d home territory. The Imperial powers lost the will to impose their rule directly (many were smashed up by fighting each other). There are other ways of domination: capital ownership, corruption, staging coups to get \u201cfriendly\u201d local governments. Officially, everybody is against imperialism. It is a bit like \u201cthe love that dares not speak its name\u201d. In practice, might still equals right in many parts of the world. ",

Initiate a financial crisis, force large numbers of people to sell their houses and land cheap (guess who is buying?), then resell it during recovery time for 4\u201310 times the price, on credit. Enslaving middle class in developped countries with unbelievable debt and make the poor of the world poorer, is the one wicked way of imperialism. How else would work, in desperation, all these people to make the rich richer? ",
