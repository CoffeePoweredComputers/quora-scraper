            "answer_text": "Edit:   Colony is a technology that will give rise to a strange world - Imagine this- there's a significant technology needed for healthy human life like maybe the ability to harvest water from the air for free, but its patented by Nestle.  As a subversive response to this demonic yet totally legal situation you could have engineers that don't know each other, pirating the product and getting paid, and the results are in the form of releasing the blueprints for free and selling the products for the cheapest price, or gifted to those in need from the excess profits (buy one give one model), to help the most people.  The water collectors are being made in a location most are unaware of.  The contributors can even be paid by the public to complete this task, which millions of people are funding anonymously because it is so important that it should happen.  It's digital constitution for the crowdfunding of it states that no one owns this project and decision making is aggregated from the contributors.  There is no single point of failure, and the overhead of management is practically made irrelevant through the aggregated super manager of the whole group. I've quoted someone before on here- the change that will be most significant in the next hundred years will not be technological, but sociological.  In light of new blockchain technogies like Ethereum and Colony I'm going to explain what they are and how they can change the world we live in, potentially more so than any other sociological change we have ever seen in human history.  Ethereum and Colony are technologies yes, but they will transform sociologically how we relate, collaborate, organise and create with each other.  Their success will depend on adoption.  Currently, in general, open source ideas that form organisations today have a great deal of trouble organising themselves to the same degree of efficiency (with regard to use of human time and skill) than their older and more highly controlled counterparts - capitalist business models that use patent control and monetary reward.  Getting venture capital for open source projects is often difficult because the new paradigm presents other unknown challenges to an investor, even though those challenges can be resolved favourably. Projects like Colony are incredible because they allow me to do things like this- I'm sick of telecommunications companys.  Take Canada and Australia, they just get more expensive all the time.  Any notion of progress in this necessary technology for humans is laughable with the monkey monopolies that run the game currently, their incentive and greed are inverse to each other.  The public know they are a mafia and that it's a wrought, but most are powerless to do anything.  Governments are not too good at running projects like telecommunications companies efficiently either- With Colony and Etherum I could propose to create an entirely new type of public asset, for the commons.  The contracts are digital and determine how contributions are recognised and how payment is released.  Contributions can be in the form of cash and other assets but also the labour and workforce that make the project possible.  The currency of the system being called nectar measures each individuals contribution.  There is no singular owner of this self organising system.  Colony distributes decision making and aggregates problems and solutions based on what people know, and their performance and contribution to the system.  That result determines what should happen, as well as how and who can do it.  I can propose to solve something, or I could be invited to solve something, both are possible.  I can take part in projects that inspire me, or perhaps the ones that no one wants to do will be rewarded more highly depending on the measured need for it.  The system allows for looking after the people that make the project possible, but for it to also enable what is normally termed profit or excess in those actions to be fed back to the commons if the constitution determines that.  Those excesses could be in the form of making the service cheaper, open sourcing its work, or it could be utilised to create and maintain other assets for the commons.  It's always going to have to adapt, and flaws need to be visible to get the most out of that, this is the most important thing these technologies need to pay attention too.  One potential shortcoming is that visionaries could be limited by the aggregated results, and sometimes those risks can provide incredible results. Ethereum is the crypto-currency component of what makes this possible.  It is a currency that has equivalents in bandwidth, computation, and drive storage and the complexity of the key used to represent those items of value.  Very different to a fiat currency system based entirely on faith.  It is also significant in that it allows currency, internet infrastructure and data to be distributed around the world anonymously.  This is a big deal because when politicians and corporations create laws around copyright, they are essentially on the wrong side of history.  I'm actually saying, give up now.  It doesn't even matter what my opinion is on copyright because it is about to become irrelevant when people have the means of storing data in a distributed network anonymously, it wont be able to be taken down, because no one will know what server it's on. Colony is the organisation component of what we are talking about, and I'm ecstatic about what it can do.  In the last year I've seen first hand how hard it is for people to live self sufficiently in community and be organised, driven, and have faith that their hard work is recognised and valued by their peers.  Currently for humans, monkey politics still dominate and I challenge anyone to find a self sufficient community that isn't dysfunctional. Colony makes it possible for me to create a new community, and in this community contributions can be proposed by anyone invited into the community, people can ask for invites of course.  Contributions can recorded and continuously weighted and valued by their peers in the system.  Decision making is distributed so there can never be any single point of failure in the system like what often happens in management and male dominated hierarchies.  People can put out requests for things to take place, or proposals, even if they cant do it themselves and colony will distrubute what is needed to determine what is that worth in nectar, when it should be done and find out who is best suited to doing that task.  In the end you have a system that measures and values peoples input whatever that may be, and you dont have anyone single point of failure for getting things done.  This is a huge deal.  When people know how they can contribute, if they are afraid of not being recognised for it they may not want to do anything.    Colony could even be our next level blueprint for what government looks like - without any single ruler, but a decentralised aggregate where we actually have a greater level of connectedness with the laws in our own localities and protection from singular top down structures prone to corruption.  Instantaneous referendum could replace all federal law in the careful and dangerous circumstances where federal laws are required.  Any non-decentralised point of vulnerability like a federal law represents opportunity for the virus of corruption to infect us.  The source code of the new blueprint government must therfore also be open source, or it represents the same potential point of failure. Anything built off Colony is of course incomplete in that any system can start out with immense flaws - since it can't begin to project the issues that may arise as time goes by.  Competitiveness can still be an issue, but I still this approach of organising could surpass the primitive and megalithic structures of corporations.  This is particularly in Colony's power to motivate the contributors that make it possible because they can have a measured stake and share in the outcome if it bears fruit.  People will take much bigger risks if they think its going to be valued.  I wouldn't be afraid of investing a fair amount of money in a hybrid technological and ecologically minded community that has these kinds of principles to guide where it could go. Colony and Ethereum can provide the means.   I will now continue what the what in 4 components.  1.  To fund as much open source knowledge and tools as we can - the cost of living can become the smallest possible.  The efficiency of humanity with regard to environmental resources and the amount of time we spend to live comfortably would be greatly improved.  Things are made to last, and with a level of co-operation that humanity cannot even dream of.  We waste much creating competitive rubbish, or worse a monopoly that doesn't actually make anything better than it has to, a product only has to be \"good enough\" to not cause a lawsuit. 2.  To decentralise and open source government - to create a wiki republic.To distinguish and educate people on the difference between a democracy, corporatocracy, and a truly decentralised republic, and protecting it.  I like the last one - with enough diversity and interdependence that is more localised and relevant to each village/locality.  It can have more immunity to corruption.  In decentralisation, laws are more relevant to locality.  Bigger governments mean more laws for more people at once and it breaks under its own weight.  Having a central federal government at all needs to be seriously questioned.  In a wikimocracy any law that applied to an entire country could more easily be handled by referendum.  For some cases standardisation has its advantages - like street signage :)Democracy or the common 2 party system really has a weak immune system against corruption, its not much bettter than socialism or communism.In an open source government politicians aren't required, only civil servants to execute the code that we the people agree upon.  The only reason why politicians existed in the first place in many countries was be able to represent the views of its people in one room, so the ideas can have it out.  The internet kinda changes that.  The politician is obsolete in this paradigm if one acknowledges the politician is supposed to represent what you want.  It is not their place to play a role as an elite ruling class because \"they know better\".An added benefit of this proposed approach I believe is people will naturally become more involved, educated, and passionate about their local politics because the effects are so rapidly and directly experienced by their own involvement.  We get feedback, whereas right now, there is a great disconnect, delay and feeling of ineffectiveness which creates apathy.This is not a fool proof answer in a nutshell, just a suggested radical change that I think has some great benefits to remove the gap between a ruling class and the ruled.   3.  To decentralise currency/banking and eliminate the fiat currency system.  We have foolishly agreed to allow a system with a set of exponential curves that would stand anyone's hair on end (when we consider the planet is finite).  Space travel is not the answer here.  We are in insanity right now.  Masses of people without homes and masses of homes without people.  Governments bailing out banks instead of people with their own money (equated to your energy).  Money created out of thin air enslaves us to the interest, which can never be paid back.  Interest used to be outlawed and was called usury.  I think that concept needs to be revisited.  The result of a small class collecting interest is that money becomes scarcer for the majority with time, and because of its percieved scarcity, one always feels they never have enough.  Achieving any kind of balance from such a system is IMPOSSIBLE.All money actually represents debt, it is created with debt, and without debt there can be no money.  The money you hold in you hand is not wealth, it is inverse wealth.  Not reversing this Orwellian perception will be at our peril.  An alternative to some kind of monetary revolution (a hard task) is also potentially resolved in number 1 and self sufficiency.  If all villages are self sustaining economies then they can easily function upon their own monetary systems of integrity - one's that perhaps approximate the truer transfer of wealth in barter.  There are many alternatives here and we need to get creative. 4.  Through number 1, it may be realised that a higher quality of living could be achieved by tending our own land, with self sufficiency and actually work less for our daily needs.  Why is that with all our technology and improvement in efficiency that we don't work less than we did 60 years ago?  The promise of the robot future is incompatible with capitalism because it equates to mass unemployment, not freedom.  I see creating self sufficient living, and tending land a more attractive alternative - a necessity to lessen our footprint and improve our quality of life and connection .  This compared to the unquestioned axiom of living in a city, in a house with a loan that enslaves people forever.  Spending your whole life to be able to own something just before your dead makes no sense. Currently, I see implementing number 1 as a precursor to the others, they will follow more naturally when the benefits of open source collaboration are fully realised.  That's why I helped Open Source Ecology make an Open Source soil mixer yesterday.  When we are able to collectively create everything required for our lives without owners of that intellectual property, I believe at that point, we win.  If you agree these principles are the right approach and you want to do it, read on.  Anyone can do a number of them. Learn to grow food - it's like printing your own money.A guerilla gardener in South Central LA If you have the means, invest in a small amount of land outside of the city that people can grow food on.  A group of people in many parts of the world can do this, potentially without a bank.  A house with a milion dollar debt seems like a silly idea?  This is the alternative - Maybe a hectare each for $25K if theres 10 of you doing it.  That value will vary, but this is a goal that is actually in reach for more people.  I'm not talking about rebuilding the failed communes of the 60's.  This is about realising that distributing our production, and care of the land by small groups of people is the only way out, stated by the UN too. 10 Reasons Why You Have to Quit Your Job This YearGet your time back, devote some of it to creating anything at all or things that are of use and make them open source.  Turn off the TV, consider deleting your facebook account.  I got a lot of time back doing that.  You might now find yourself bored.  Good, your just doing it wrong.  You just need to figure out what you want to create.  Share how to do it when its done and make that knowledge free. If making anything open source interests you, do it!  People of all talents can.  Even if its something you've never done before.  I have never fabricated a piece of large machinery before this week, but Open Source Ecology showed me how I could.  These are the machines we need to build, but anything you think is useful can be built, even a blender.Machines: Global Village Construction SetMany cities in the world have hackerspace groups open to anyone.  These are great melting pots to meet up with people for realising and building ideas.  If you're specialised in any of these areas then you can definitely help out others. Help crowd fund open source projects like the one above or any others that you believe have value.  I'm going to start another non-profit variant of this in Australia in a year.  I don't think we have anything like it currently.  So if you want to help there, or you can donate, or have skills, knowledge, or fundraising abilities that you think could enable this vision in Australia get in touch with me.
