            "answer_text": "The official name of the country is Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and it is considered a presidential democracy under the political classification. The president is the head of the state and he/she is elected every five years by the vote of the people. The prime minister is the head of the parliament and is selected to office by the majority vote of MPs. MPs themselves are selected from the vote of the people. A Socialist country is defined as \u201c a country where the government or the public as a whole has control over the economy. In a socialist country, the producing and dispersing of goods is owned by the government.Socialism is placed in between capitalism and communism\u201d In Sri Lanka both the public and private sectors contribute to the economy. The production and dispersing of many goods and services is not in fact owned by the public. However the public education system and the public healthcare system is owned and controled by the government and is free of charge. All tuition, lab fees, uniform fees and textbooks for students under 18 enrolled in public school system are provided by the state as are medical care to all patients who seek medical help from the public hospitals. Privately owned enterprises can and do exist. In fact, right now most of the enterprises are owned by private companies. And the government actively encourages private investments. So, Sri Lanka shows some characteristics of a socialist country while not being exactly a completely socialist state. Hope this helped! ",
