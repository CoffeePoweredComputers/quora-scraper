            "answer_text": "There is the view that Trotsky fought for leadership of the Central Committee, but he was designated by Lenin to be successor for Chairmanship. Trotsky would have ushered in the Fourth International. Some see Trotsky as an opportunist, changing his view/decisions with whatever his political whim was. He did change his mind about different ideas as new discussion came forth. That is one of the hallmarks of Trotskyism\u2026the ability to be fluid. Prior to the final vote in committee, there is much heated discussion. A view is not forced on any member, but one may strongly try to convince another to vote a particular way. After much heated discussion with a proposal viewed and voiced from every viewpoint that a member may conceive of, a final vote is taken with the members taking the party line. One may disagree in private with other committee members, but keep the party line to outsiders. One of other Socialists and Communists have with Trotskyists is the belief that we are Intellectualists who spend way too much time discussing the position at hand. Discussion should be the bedrock of any vote. Others also believe Trotskyists not to be also Marxist-Leninist. Trotskyism is not incongruent with Marxism or Leninism. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that it is the opposite, socialists and communists prefer Trotsky over Stalin but Trotskyism has been attracted a bunch of idiots that use entryism and split over random questions. Trotsky was not more humane even if Stalin did kill everyone within his range. So please, don\u2019t promote him as a better leader because he wasn\u2019t. The big difference between Stalin and Trotsky was the view on how to handle revolutionary situations. In exploited countries, Trotsky saw the necessity of going directly to the socialist stage since the capitalist in these was all too connected to the imperialist agents. Stalin, on the other hand, wanted a stage policy: feudalism-capitalism-socialism-communism. ",
