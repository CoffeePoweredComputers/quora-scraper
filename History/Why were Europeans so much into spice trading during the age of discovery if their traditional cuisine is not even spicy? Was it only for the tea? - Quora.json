            "answer_text": "Spices were enormously important in Europe in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and other spices were used for a variety of purposes. They were though to have medicinal properties, they formed the basis of incense used in churches, and they were used in great quantities in the cuisine of the upper classes. Exotic, expensive, and tasty, spices were an excellent status symbol. The thing about covering the taste of spoiled food was a myth, though; no amount of pepper will disguise the taste of rotten meat, and anybody who could afford spices could afford fresh food. And then, around the 16th and 17th centuries, things changed. There were a number of reasons for that. One is that the Protestant Reformation hit. In parts of Europe, incense went out of vogue and spices were perceived as a Catholic luxury. There was also a shift in \u201cmedical\u201d thinking about digestion. Rich, smooth, and creamy was in, spices were out. Finally, new trade routes to the east brought increased quantities of spices to Europe, dropping their prices and ironically making them less prominent as luxury goods. Spices were still used in more modest quantities on an individual basis (even though total imports had increased significantly), but things like tobacco, coffee, tea, and chocolate became more prestigious.

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a recipe for cinnamon brewet from 14th century France, translated into medieval-ish English by Janet Hinson: Cinnamon Brewet. Break up your poultry or other meat and stew it in water, putting wine therewith, and [then] fry it; then take raw almonds in their shells unpeeled and great plenty of cinnamon and bray then very well and moisten them with your broth or with beef broth and boil them with your meat; then bray ginger, cloves and grain [of Paradise] etc., and let it be thick and red. Of course, like most medieval recipes, this one describes spices as \u201cgreat plenty\u201d not a certain number of spoonfuls. So, the question is how much was a \u201cgreat plenty of cinnamon\u201d? Looking at a modern version of that recipe, we get the answer: half a teaspoon of cinnamon per pound of beef. Here\u2019s that modern recipe: Ingredients 4 lbs. Beef Roast 2 cups Almonds, ground 2 tsp. Cinnamon 1/2 tsp. Ginger 1/2 tsp. Cloves 2-4 cups Red Wine 2-3 cups Beef stock Method Season beef with sprinkling of cinnamon and brown on all sides. Place into a roasting pan add red wine and beef stock and half of the rest of the spices. Braise in a 350\u00b0F oven for 1 1/2 to 2 hours until well done. Remove from oven; take beef from roasting pan, drain juices and separate fat. Place meat broth into a sauce pan and bring to a boil, add almonds and begin to thicken. Taste, add additional spices as needed. Strain thickened sauce. Slice meat and serve with thickened sauce. You ask why Europeans traded for spices when their cuisine is not spicy. Europeans used spices sparingly and only in some special dishes, but they did use them, and greatly valued the contribution of spices to a dish (for example, calling the above dish \u201ccinnamon brewet\u201d despite it containing only a sprinkling of cinnamon). A culture with intensely spicy food will have very inexpensive spices. The culture won\u2019t be able to develop intensely spicy food without spices being inexpensive, and it wouldn\u2019t be worth sailing around the world to get something inexpensive (there is a market for many pounds of spices, but not for many dollars of spices). A culture like medieval Europe that used a small amount of highly valued spices could make spice merchants rich, because there was a market for spices, and the spices were worth enough per pound to cover the shipping costs.
