            "answer_text": "First of all life is not fair, and neither is history. Speaking of which, to understand why East Germany (GDR) was smaller you have to understand its history: After the second world war the whole of Germany was divided into four sectors amongst the allied forces: American, British, French, and Soviet, and so was Berlin:  Notice something already? East Germany simply is the Soviet sector. After the war the tensions between east and west grew quickly, and as a result the Russian sector got cut off the rest of Germany. The three west sectors eventually became West Germany (FRG). This was never about any Germans wanting the country to be divided, nor about fairness, but a simple result of the war and the subsequent cold war. If you look at a map of Europe of that time you can see that the Iron Curtain went right through Germany. For more details look here: Allied-occupied Germany - Wikipedia Iron Curtain - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, it was larger than one would have expected given the idea that East Germany being assigned to the USSR was technically 1/4 of the Four Power Agreement that created sectors of influence in Germany after the war. East Gergmany was also known as the SBZ (Sovietische Basatzungszone), the Soviet Occupation Zone. Considering the reality, East Germany was larger than it might have been if the Russians hadn\u2019t made the huge sacrifice it did in driving to Berlin during mid-1945.  With reference to Berlin, as the capital city of the defeated Germany it was also divided by the four powers. The Soviet sector violated the terms of the agreement by starting the isolation of Berlin by land routes in mid-1948 that led to the Berlin Airlift. It also violated the terms of the London Protocol by establishing Berlin as its capital city. West Germany, you will remember, created a new capital city in the smallish city of Bonn. ",
