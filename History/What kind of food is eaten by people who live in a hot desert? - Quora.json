However, per the Aramaco World magazine I once read, (back in the 1980s), the Arabic countries don\u2019t eat hot spices, like chili peppers. Lots of spice, yes, but not the kind that makes you sweat. They are trying to retain all the fluid they can, not lose it to sweat/evaporation. Spicy hot foods are specialties of hot HUMID climates, like Malaysia, and India, and the Caribbean Islands. Allspice, black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, cumin, nutmeg, mint, and anise. The tagine, (the pot, not the stew), retains the fluid of the food cooked in it, the tall steepled lid allowing the steam to rise, condense, and return to the lower base, saving water. And since they didn\u2019t use utensils, they also used flatbread and pita to eat with. ",

I really like fresh squeezed orange and lime juice to cool off with. I also like chilled hummus when it's warm outside. Ice cream is good, but i am not obsessed with it. But it seems like some people who live here prefer spicy hot food, and I sometimes like that kind of food too. It's just spicy, not like steaming hot. Good for you too. Kim chi can be good. Pasta salad I could go on and on but I won't ",
