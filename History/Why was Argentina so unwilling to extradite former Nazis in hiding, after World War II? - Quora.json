            "answer_text": " Adolf Eichmann, one of the most famous Nazi officials who sought haven in Argentina, both due to his inhumane actions, and Israel\u2019s epic hunt for him (adapted into the movie \u201cOperation Finale\u201d). Before my answer, I would just like to say that this doesn\u2019t say anything about Argentina itself, as not only was it not the only country to accept Nazis after WWII, the war criminals they were harboring had little effect on the country itself. Plus, these are all things of the past now. An observable, if not considerable part of Argentina\u2019s motives to take in the inhumane monsters was their quite clear alliance with the axis powers. Even though the country did declare war on the fascists, it was most likely to provide refuge and support for Germany, whose defeat they foresaw. Another reason was pure ideology. Sadly, the country was plagued with large amounts of anti-semitism during president Juan Domingo Peron\u2019s regime (more on him later). Argentina\u2019s distaste for the Jewish back then was never kept secret: the country had a small Jewish population even pre-WWII, and banned Jewish immigration completely when Germany started its prosecution of its Jewish population. Another driving factor was the oncoming Cold War. The western powers were quite against giving Nazi war criminals to their communist foes, so when the USSR asked for the return of several of their most deeply hated, the west sent some to South America, in particular Argentina. Also, Peron saw the numerous extremely anti-communist fascist leaders they harbored as a tool in negotiation in a (as they believed it) inevitable war between west and east. But after Peron lost power, quickly most of the bloodthirsty inhumane fascist leaders were brought to justice, including Adolf Eichmann. Again, I am in no way saying anything against Argentina: time passes, things change, corruption happens. ",

            "answer_text": "To extradite Argentina, you need a PRIOR TREATY with the country you are requesting. In addition, the crime must be CRIME IN ARGENTINA. The penalty to apply CANNOT BE DEATH, since it does not exist in Argentine law. Beyond the technicalities, the Argentines of that time saw with horror that the winners of a war try to put guys on trial just for losing it. The HOLOCAUST of Jews, Gypsies and others was not so clear and so widespread. For many Argentines, the Germans were received as people fleeing the war (like many Jews) As they were (both) working people, they had no problems integrating and living. I do remember the extradition of Erich Priebke to Italy. ",
