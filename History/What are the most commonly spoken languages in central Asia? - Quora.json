            "answer_text": "I have been to Central Asia about nine times in the last four years. When saying, \u201cCentral Asia,\u201d I\u2019m assuming we are talking about the countries of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. Now, each of these countries have their own language, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Turkmen, and Tajik, respectively. So there is no \u201cmain language\u201d in C.A. There is, however, this one thing; all of these nations were part of the Soviet Union, and therefore Russian language was imposed on them. Thus Russian is still used extensively in many places. I have been to Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, and I do not speak neither Kazakh, nor Kyrgyz, I do, however speak Russian. I am able to get around with Russian only in most places in these two countries. I have a close friend in Uzbekistan who tells me that you can get around knowing only Russian in Uzbekistan as well. Furthermore, I know Kazakh and Kyrgyz people that speak only Russian. Living in big cities they really don\u2019t have to know their language because Russian is used practically everywhere. This is not to say, however, that Russian is the main language in C.A., but is rather the Lingua Franca of the region. Once you leave the big cities and head out into the country, you will encounter people that will hardly know any Russian, and only speak their own language. For the exception of Tajik, the other four are Turkic languages, while Tajik is Indo-Iranian, related to Farsi. Besides their national languages there are very many smaller people groups that have their own languages, most of which are also Turkic, and some are not. The Turkic languages spoken in C.A. are rather close one to another, but speaking one does not guarantee you understanding the others. Kazakh and Kyrgyz are very close, while Uzbek is a bit more different, and I can\u2019t comment on Turkmen due to my limited knowledge about it. I absolutely love their culture, language, music, and cuisine, and cannot wait to get back to my favorite city, Bishkek. ",

            "answer_text": "Every country in Central Asia has own language. Kazakh, Uzbek, Turkmen and Kyrgyz languages belong to the group of Turkic languages. Tajik, Dari, and Pashto languages are very close to Farsi (Persian language). And people in Mongolia speak in Mongolian. In former Soviet Union countries (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan) Russian is a Lingua franca language. So there is no main language in Central Asia ",
