Instead he stated , correctly, that he has done more for blacks than the Great Emancipator who freed them. Biden then called Trump Lincoln in a demented state of mind. That\u2019s all. He didn\u2019t star the star \u2b50\ufe0f was Trump. ",

            "answer_text": "Because, Donald J. Trump, repeated his claim that he has done more for African Americans than any other president since or with the exception of, Abraham Lincoln.Then in one of, Biden\u2019s comments he mentioned Abraham Lincoln when addressing Trump\u2019s claim. Trump, interrupted and responded by saying that he never said that he WAS Abraham Lincoln but that he has done more since\u2026.Lincoln. The whole issue is nonsense and ultimately unimportant.Concerning, Trump\u2019s claim about having done more for blacks (AAs) than Lincoln each person should evaluate that claim for themselves. But it should be noted that, Harry Truman, desegregated the armed forces.Lyndon Johnson, passed the Civil Rights legislation in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1968. ",
