            "answer_text": "The other answers I've read suggest very admirable reasoning for Reagan's political transformation, but at the time he was governor of California I learned that the year he earned the greatest income as an actor was 1949, a year when he earned more than a million dollars.  In those years the maximum tax rate on personal income was above the 80th percentile, so Reagan was able to keep less than a fifth of his income at that time. That's when he became a doctrinaire opponent of taxing the wealthy. Our presidents in the years following that until 1981 - both Democrats and Republicans - entered politics fundamentally because they felt that those who had somewhat privileged lives should give back to those less privileged. These people uniformly objected to the government and other public institutions' ignoring the well-being of the downtrodden. Reagan was the first - but not the last - of our modern presidents who entered political life because he felt that government and other public institutions were ignoring the well-being of people like himself.

            "answer_text": "The question suggests that you're using a fixed ideological reference. An 'FDR' or  'Truman Democrat' doesn't quite mean what you think. A Wilson Democrat would agree that the US should invade the USSR to overthrow Communism and arrest all of our own Communists. An FDR Democrat would agree that the USSR was untrustworthy and that the US should start an anti-Soviet spy hunt. VENONA was one aspect of that. A Truman Democrat would support Truman's launch of the Red Scare and the Cold War. As good Democrats, Bobby Kennedy worked for Joe McCarthy and Ronald Reagan named names. At the Democratic Party Convention of 1948, Hubert Humphrey told the delegates that the Democrats should concern themselves more with civil rights than States rights. The Dixiecrats walked out and Truman chose a white supremacist as a running mate.  Over the next twenty years, the Democratic Party reinvented itself as a party of national government and civil rights. Reagan left with the Dixiecrats and the States rights faction of Truman/FDR's Democratic party.  By contrast, keeping in mind that at 17.2% of GDP the average federal government tax burden under Reagan set a modern high--probably the highest ever up to his time, and higher than say, under Obama--Reagan wasn't really a small gummint guy. In modern Republican spin, Reagan's big achievement was the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but his policies had relatively little to do with that.  His main fiscal achievements were two. In cooperation with the Republican controlled Senate, he restored the solvency of the Social Security trust fund. He also effectively socialized healthcare in the US. We just had to wait until recently for a president with the backbone to get it paid for. ",
