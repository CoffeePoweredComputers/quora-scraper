            "answer_text": "There are a lot of people who graduate in history with honours from University of Delhi and a majority of them certainly do not pursue a career in history. BA (Hons) History is among the most popular courses because, quite frankly, it has relatively lower cut offs. And you need to keep in mind that History, and Social Sciences at large, is not really a job oriented field and it is very rare that you are going to pursue a history related job after graduating. There is a very tiny fraction of people who actually go for Masters in History or pursue a career in History after graduating in history. BA (Hons) History is mostly a \u2018footing\u2019 course which most of the students do for the sake of doing graduation and do a variety of things after that, such as Mass Media, designing, preparation for government jobs, etc. I am pursuing History at University of Delhi and I hardly have a student around me who is here for history. So yes, students do a hell lot of things after they graduate in History. Some of them become really successful like Rajdeep Sardesai, Major Gaurav Arya, Dr Upinder Singh, etc, but you need to realise that these people are not the norm but exception. Most of the History graduates hardly make a decent living in a field even remotely related to their field of study, thanks to the sorry state of affairs in India where there are hardly any jobs for history folks and no, I am not discouraging you if you want to pursue this course. All that I want to say is that you need to know what you are signing up for and pursue it accordingly with all of your heart. I am studying history and I want to make a career in it and I know what I am signing up for. I know that there is not a job out there for me and I pursuing it accordingly, working to create a niche for myself. There was another questions about career opportunities for undergraduates in History which I answered a while back. You should read my answer there as well. Madhur Sharma's answer to What are my career options after doing graduation in history honours from Delhi University? Best wishes to you. Cheers. ",
