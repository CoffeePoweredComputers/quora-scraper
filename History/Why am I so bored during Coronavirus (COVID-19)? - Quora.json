            "answer_text": "You tell me why you are bored? I do not get bored, too much to see, do and learn. To me boredom it a state of mind, shuffle your thinking, find things to do. I know it is hard for some people to be shut in their homes, but we can use it as a time for personal growth. Read some good books, go for a long walk wearing a face mask, do not touch any solid surfaces or wear gloves. Find some games on the computer, there are lots of them. I have been doing chores around my home, cleaned of my deck, emptied all the pots, re-soiled them, planted veg and herbs, some of the seeds are old, so may not take, but I do have toms, green beans and some herbs up. I love to watch them grow, new life and hope to be able to feed myself this summer, maybe have enough to give away! If you like dogs, go to the pound and adopt someone who will give you love, good company and you can go for walks together. I have 2 cats I play with. Get in a chat group online, do jigsaws, word search, crosswords, learn to cook if you don\u2019t know how, cook yourself some nice meals. Make some bread or cup cakes, put the excess in the freezer. Learn how to do Tai Chi, or Yoga, there are beginner tapes on computer. See why I do not get bored. I wish you well, stay safe from the virus\u2026.Andria\u2026.. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks Harry for A2A. This is part of \u2018life experience package\u2019. People who are first timers in such a tight situation, they find it extremely tormenting. The restrictions imposed are against our sense of freedom. It hurts our pride. We forget that we are exposed to numerous limitations and we have to face with courage. So your feeling bored is because you are not used to the situations like that. You feel life is easy, may be with minor ups and downs. THE PANDEMIC HAS CLAMPED A BIG CHECK ON OUR ACTIVITIES. Our routines are blocked and altered. We feel helpless. We are unhappy for feeling that way. All the above feelings are translated to boredom. Facing with patience and courage is the only way. . . . Thanks for reading. ",
