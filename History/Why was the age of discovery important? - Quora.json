            "answer_text": "First of all this is not the age of discoveries and revelations from nature.This is the age of technology,techno inventions and the resulting pollution.Inventions are man\u2019s manipulations.They are not discoveries.Read below. Hatred for Nature Science is man\u2019s divorce to nature. The divorce extends to his own emotions, in addition to all organisms in the Biosphere. It simply is divorce to emotions, the emanations of breathing. As he cannot trust his breathing and the resulting flow of emotions, he has taken to technology, which now is the functioning substitute to his own perception. The basic gospel of Science is \u2018there is only a mechanical and technological fix for everything\u2019. Today a gigantic holocaust on every organism, which includes the dethronement of nature and substitution by mechanical processes, is taking place. Smugly and academically we call this holocaust, progress. All nations are busy militarizing. New and new weapons are tested, every test kills many organisms, the weapon sellers propagate fake tensions, to increase their sales. A big joint stock company manufacturing weapons will be having secret subsidiary companies in the nations which are adversaries, and they propel the sales of their weapons in both the adversaries. The MNCs are basically owned by the same people, though they have different names in different countries. Diseases are te results of new and new pollution created by industries. Every new invention and new process creates new poisons. I do not know whether there is any study that has investigated about the new diseases, started by the industrial revolution or disaster, diseases which simply did not exist before the industrial revolution. The mechanical fix has taken over even the subjects of study in the Universities. Every subject starts with a definition, defines the scope or the territory of the subject, and then takes to the mechanical relationships of the components of the divisions of the subject divided into chapters. There is simply no University that does not adopt the mechanical approach. There is no university that promotes perception by breathing, smelling and sensing, where free and lush nature is the basic need. Even the faculties of Philosophy are discontinued. The universities are actually taken over by business interests, and campus recruitment means, that there will be only courses that create employable trainees, trained in the mechanical processes or in accounting which must only be commercial accounting. These are the last days of the Biosphere and we call it the great advancement. Nature too must have fundamental rights which are more important than the fundamental rights written in constitutions.

            "answer_text": "It changed the entire world, some for the better some for the worse. The Native Americans were for the most part wiped out, but the Columbian Exchange brought entirely new food crops to the rest of the world fueling a rapid population growth in Europe, Asia and Africa. Ask yourself where would the world be today without corn, potatoes, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, squash and chocolate, also rubber, quinine, vanilla (with the negatives being tobacco and cocaine).
