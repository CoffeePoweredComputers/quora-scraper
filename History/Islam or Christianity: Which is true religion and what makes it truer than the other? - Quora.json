            "answer_text": "Islam or Christianity: Which is true religion and what makes it truer than the other?  False dilemma. That is, it\u2019s possible that both Christianity and Islam are false. However, I\u2019ll argue for Christianity for this answer. If any theological proposition violates known historical or scientific or logical consensus, that theological proposition is less likely to be true when compared with a theological proposition that does not violate known historical or scientific or logical consensus. For example, in Islamic theology the death of Jesus on the cross is rejected on theological bases. That is, Jesus did not die or get crucified but this just appeared so. Most Islamic beliefs say that another person was made to look like Jesus and that person was killed or crucified.The Islamic rejection is based on the Quranic dependence on Gnostic sources that are historically late and theologically infected with erroneousness. The Gnostic community rejected the god of Abraham because they believed that the god that created the physical world is an evil god. Therefore, there is a difficulty between history and theology in Islamic theology. Christian theology the death of Jesus on the cross is accepted on both theological bases and on historical bases.Therefore, there is no difficulty between history and theology in Christian theology.Since the Christian theological proposition agrees with history but the Islamic theological proposition disagrees with history, the Christian theological proposition is more likely to be true and the Islamic theological proposition less likely to be true. There are other major problems with the Islamic theological propositions. For example, Islam rejects a historical consensus (Jesus\u2019 death on the cross) on theological bases (theological bases are both unfalsifiable and unverifiable). Theological rejections of historical consensus are inferior to historical rejections of historical consensus because historical rejections are both falsifiable and verifiable and because unfalsifiable propositions commit the logical fallacy of unfalsifiability. Therefore, Islamic theological propositions (in context of Jesus\u2019 death on the cross) are far more inferior to that of Christian theological propositions.We can be certain that the Christian theological proposition is more likely to be true than the Islamic theological proportions and since Christian theology and Islamic theology are contradictory (only one can be true or both false), Christian theology is more likely to be true when compared to Islamic theology.Therefore, Christianity is more likely to be true than Islam.

            "answer_text": "Reading from the books of the Quran, Islam can be considered an outgrowth or an evolution of Christianity. The Quran contains books about Moses, Mary, and Jesus after all. However, Islam views these figures as prophets and it does not consider Jesus divine. In Islam, Jesus did not die on the cross nor was he resurrected. None of the foundational theological basis of Christianity marks or defines Jesus as far as Islam is concerned. The question of whether Islam or Christianity is the true religion is a question of which religion leads to a profound experience of God. The answer depends on how you view religion. If you view it in terms of honor, fidelity, and surrender, you could say that Islam is the true religion. There are variations of Christianity that could compete against Islam. Traditional Catholicism is an example of this. But if you define true religion as essentially God-based and involving actions by God that cannot be replicated by men then Bible-based evangelical Christianity is the true religion. Unlike most of the religions in the world, Bible-based Christianity is centered on God\u2019s grace for salvation. This means that the question of whether you go to heaven or hell does not depend on you. Your goodness or obedience to rules does not matter. Having come from a long line of believers does not count either. What matters is God deciding whether you belong to heaven or hell. That is how sovereign He is. Only God has the power to save. You can neither help Him nor earn His mercy. There is nothing you can do. The concept of grace is ingrained in the Bible. In the Books of Romans and Galatians, Apostle Paul wrote that salvation happens only through faith and God\u2019s grace. We only need to claim Jesus and He will give us salvation. If such is the case, does having the right conduct or following God\u2019s commands still matter? Is becoming a good person still important in Christianity? Of course, it is. But all these are brought about by your personal acceptance of Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior after you have confessed that you are a sinner and accepted His gift. Jesus already saved you. He already paid the price on the cross. He died the death that we all deserved as sinners. All we need to do is claim that by faith. We have to fully believe that we have been saved to become born again and when you are born again by the Holy Spirit something changes in you. Being born again is not a matter of ritual where water is sprinkled or poured over your head. It is what happens in the heart that matters. That is when the Holy Spirit convicts your heart and you quickly realize you are a sinner and that you need Jesus every single second. The more you love Him because He loved you first - and loved you enough to die for you, the more strength you will receive from the Holy Spirit to live a life that you were not living before. This is the reason many alcoholics, sex addicts, drug addicts, prostitutes, scumbags, liars, adulterers, and criminals get transformed. The reason is real Christianity, real religion does not lie. You may know the Bible very well, name all the saints, and light the candles the right way, but this will not save you. People can see if your life has changed. We do not mean a transformation here and there or a change that is short-lived. We mean a lifelong change that can only happen because of the Holy Spirit. That is the level of immediacy that Christianity demands from true followers. It is a demand, not an option. A lifelong change is impossible if you are going to lean on your own strength. If you are going to be a Christian solely on the account of your family being Christians, you will not succeed. You know you are living a lie and everybody else knows it too. But when you truly accept Jesus Christ you constantly do what you do because He lives in you. As Apostle Paul wrote in the Letter to the Galatians, \u201cIt is no longer I who lives but Christ who lives in me.\u201d You can tell the good tree from the bad tree by its fruit. If you have been a bad tree all your life; if you have been full of deceit, anger, unforgiveness, gossip, and other sins, you can start bearing good fruit by allowing Jesus to transform your heart through the Holy Spirit. What kind of fruit is this? The fruit of the Holy Spirit. In the Letter to the Galatians, Apostle Paul wrote that if you truly accept Jesus Christ despite yourself and your past, you will be able to love, experience real joy, have patience, be truly kind, express real goodness, be faithful and gentle, and practice self-control. An ancient great philosopher once said that we are what we consistently do. The Holy Spirit enables us to consistently become these. Christianity is fast-growing in many places in the world not because those places are being bombarded with Bibles. It is because people are beginning to live totally different lives. Case in point, people in many Catholic regions of Central and South America are switching to evangelical Christianity because they witnessed people who are alcoholics prostitutes, pimps, killers becoming completely different people after embracing the Lord. True religion bears fruit. It cannot be faked. It cannot be denied. Its only condition is you accept Jesus. As Jesus said in the Book of Revelations, \u201cI am standing at the door of your heart. If you open that door, I will come in.\u201d One way to phrase this in the bluntest yet accurate way possible is Jesus asks us to kill ourselves. Kill the old man. The man who is unable to forgive, the man who believes that his present must be an extension of the past and all its pain and trauma. That old man has to die for the new man to arise. There is a great book by the author E.A. Cruz entitled \u201cJesus Says Go Kill Yourself\u201d that lays out the Christian case for true religion. ",
