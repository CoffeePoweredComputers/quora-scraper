            "answer_text": "There have been five elections in which the winner did not get the most electoral votes. In one of them, the winner actually didn\u2019t get the most popular votes or electoral votes. They are: 1824. Andrew Jackson got 41.4% of the popular vote to John Quincy Adams\u2019 30.9%. Jackson also got 99 electoral votes to Quincy Adams\u2019 84. But, since no one received a majority of the electoral votes (131 were needed to win), a contingent election was held in the House of Representatives. Henry Clay, very influential in the House, got enough votes for Quincy Adams, since he hated Jackson, and Quincy Adams won the election.1876: The most screwed up presidential election in history. I won\u2019t go into details here, but there were questions about 20 electoral votes cast and Congress set up a special commission to determine what should be done with those votes. In the end, even though Samuel Tilden received the most popular votes (50.9% to Hayes\u2019 47.9%), Hayes got all 20 of the electoral votes in question, giving him a 185\u2013184 electoral win. Tilden is the only presidential candidate to lose an election while getting a majority of the popular vote.1888: Incumbent president Grover Cleveland got more popular votes than Benjamin Harrison (48.6% to 47.8%), Harrison won the electoral vote 233\u2013168. Four years later, Cleveland got revenge and beat Harrison in a rematch, returning Cleveland to the White House.2000. The \u201cFlorida hanging chad\u201d election and the second most screwed up presidential election in history. Al Gore got 48.4% of the popular vote to George W. Bush\u2019s 47.9%, Gore getting just a little over 500,000 more votes out of over 101 million cast. But, Bush got 271 electoral votes, one more than needed to win, over Gore\u2019s 266.2016. Hillary Clinton got 48.2% of the popular vote to Donald Trump\u2019s 46.1%. Trump won the electoral vote, though, 304\u2013227.",
