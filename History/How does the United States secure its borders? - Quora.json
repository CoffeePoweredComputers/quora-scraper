            "answer_text": "The Canadian border is famously well kept, with spaced markers and clearings.   A Alaska-Yukon border, it follows the 141st meridian and is about 647 miles long and marked by a clearing 20 feet across. Three crews, two American and one Canadian, are charged with maintaining this particular clearing. The entire border is marked this way and is maintained by the International Boundary  Commission.  A few centuries ago the United States and Canada, at the time still a part of the British empire, decided the 49th parallel would mark the border from Minnesota to Washington at the London convention in 1818. Then they sent a group to mark it with big stone markers. Needless to say traversing an uninhabited forest for hundreds of miles in a perfectly straight line with no gps didn't really work out to well so years later in 1925 the International Boundary Commission was founded.   However the border is almost completely uninhabited on either side and rarely do people cross it save for a number of checkpoints.  The Mexican border is a different story, it's the busiest border in the world, with almost a billion crossings back and forth legally and illegally annually. The secure fence act of 2006 had 700 miles of fencing built along the border, but the majority of the border is wide open.   The United States border patrol does most of the law enforcement and administration on the southern border and with over 21,000 agents it's one of the largest law enforcement agencies in the country. They're as well equipped as you would expect, with all terrain vehicles a small fleet of drones and several thousand checkpoints. Millions of illegal immigrants and goods are seized annually but the Government Accountability Office estimated in 2013 that only about 61% of these offenses are caught. I hope this answers your question.   ",
