            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a story that explains it beautifully. I read a brief account someone wrote of an experience they had. This person was walking with a friend, and they stopped at a newsstand so the friend could buy a newspaper. The man running the newsstand was surly, rude, and condescending. The friend paid for the paper, thanked the man politely, and they went on their way. The conversation that followed went like this: The person narrating the anecdote: \u201cWow, what\u2019s his problem?\u201d The friend: \u201cOh, he\u2019s always like that.\u201d Narrator: \u201cSo why were you so friendly to him?\u201d Friend: \u201cWhy should I let him control how I behave?\u201d That\u2019s Biden dealing with Trump, I think. There\u2019s also a story about Abraham Lincoln walking down the street with a friend and being confronted by someone angrily saying ugly things to him, clearly looking for a fight. Lincoln just tipped his hat to this person and kept on walking. When his friend asked how Lincoln could let some lowlife talk to him like that, Lincoln said that if he encountered a dog looking for a fight over occupancy of a square of the sidewalk, he walked about the dog at a safe distance rather than waste his time, energy, and safety fighting it. I think that\u2019s also Biden handling Trump. ",

            "answer_text": "Trump treats every opponent the same, he LIES and applies derogatory labels and names to his opponents to appeal to the racism, hate, anger, prejudice, religious bigotry, anti-immigration, etc. to turn the American public against his opponent. He does the opposite to his allies. There is no logic or truth in this strategy and that is why Trump will not and cannot answer a straight question in any interview - instead he simply quickly changes the topic and recites the same talking points over and over. This style is so obvious in every interview he does, in every question he answers, in every debate. If pressed on his lies, he will raise his voice to intimidate the reporter who always backs down out of respect for the presidency. Honest, truthful politicians with integrity that really want to help people and solve social issues EMBRACE logical, rhetorical debate based on facts in an organized and structured way to prove they have a better solution. They will accept and acknowledge facts, especially those contrary to their argument because in the end it is a search for the truth not a contest to see who wins. The one thing obvious to any business person is Trump does not believe in the WIN - WIN philosophy that is so critical in business. That is exactly WHY he is an utter failure in business and why he had so many bankruptcies. Trump believes in WIN - LOSE, he must win and his opponent must lose - that never works. It results in the chaos, confusion, and polarization so evident in his administration and our country. He literally starts a fight, pitting one side against the other in every speech he gives. He is literally starting another civil war and Putin is very happy about that. Save our country - VOTE EARLY - VOTE STRAIGHT DEMOCRAT ",
