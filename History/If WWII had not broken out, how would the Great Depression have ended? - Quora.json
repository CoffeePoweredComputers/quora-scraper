With new borrowing and new investment, money supply start to grow again, and Great Depression ends. or 2) much more pessimistically, the deflation process causes violate social upheavals, the society breaks down, and mini WWII breaks out all over...

            "answer_text": "One possibility As there are no proper medical care available in that time, there would be an outbreak of a deadly disease like Ebola now. Like now, many people might have died in the poor countries due to lack of proper medical care and the rich countries would be busy in protecting themselves and proving that they are powerful. Ultimately, the country which provides the medical care to the poor countries would eventually take it as a opportunity to get hold of the world.  The countries which don't like this would come to a fight against them and thus which would break out into World War II. PS: WWII was inevitable. It made the world realize the value of people and life. ",
