            "answer_text": "In the cat species, it\u2019s all about the \u201cPride\u201d. The Lionesses were probably saving their cubs from the male Lion. There is a reason to it, as each time a new Lion encroaches a specific territory, it wants all the previous traces to vanish. And to do it, the Lion starts with killing all the cubs as he is not the father of them. He then mates with the females to ensure the territory stays for long. The same process keeps going on. The male Lion usually fight among each other to mark their territory. But, in this video, the Lion was fighting for the pride and the Lionesses were fighting for their cubs. One can even ask \u201cwhy do this usually happen?\u201dA simple explanation to it: all the cat species are territorial in nature. Hence, they want to embrace their lands.This is a natural process and we are no one to interfere. Thank You Quora. ",
