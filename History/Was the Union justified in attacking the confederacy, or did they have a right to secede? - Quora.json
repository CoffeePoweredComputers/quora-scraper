            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cWas the Union justified in attacking the confederacy, or did they have a right to secede?\u201d Regardless of one\u2019s opinions on the reasons for the secessions (there were two separate strings of secessions, one following the Election of Abraham Lincoln, the second following Abraham Lincoln\u2019s calling for an army to invade the South.) secession actually is guaranteed under the constitution. Many people will argue that the constitution does not explicitly mention secession, so therefore it is not a state right. This attitude however, reflects an ignorance of the Bill of Rights. Amendment X \u201cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\u201d In other words, any right or power not specifically prohibited to the states by the constitution, or granted to the federal government, is a state right. Taken literally and logically, secession being part of anything, this makes secession a right. So legally, the Confederacy was in the right. Morally, it\u2019s a much more complicated matter. In another answer, it has been claimed that the South started the war by attacking Fort Sumter. The issue is a bit more complex. After secession, the South seized the coastal defense forts along the Atlantic. There was only one that wasn\u2019t immediately peacefully surrendered\u2014Fort Sumter. Upon learning of the siege, Abraham Lincoln dispatched a relief vessel. This was a military action, and could very easily be considered an act of war. At the very least, it was a provocation. The point in doing so was to force the Confederates to attack the Fort. Lincoln never negotiated with the South. Lincoln did much to fan the flames of war and did nothing to prevent it\u2019s outbreak, so I personally consider much of the onus of the war to be on his shoulders. ",

            "answer_text": " It depends on who you asked and when you asked them. The right of secession had been bandied about since the birth of the nation. There was a certain amount of hypocrisy from the New England states since they had pushed for secession earlier and even had a convention. Why? Because of race. New England wanted racial purity Among the whites and wanted to keep non whites out of the country. sounds a little hypocritical! \u201cContrary to standard accounts, the birthplace of American secessionist sentiment was not Charleston, South Carolina in 1860, but the heart of the New England Yankee culture -- Salem, Massachusetts -- more than half a century before the first shot was fired at Fort Sumter. From 1800 to 1815, there were three serious attempts at secession orchestrated by New England Federalists, who believed that the policies of the Jefferson and Madison administrations, especially the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the national embargo of 1807, and the War of 1812, were so disproportionately harmful to New England that they justified secession.\u201c \u201cIf these New England Federalists had been southerners and said the things they said in 1861 rather than in 1803, they would have long ago been denigrated by historians as maniacal \"fire eaters\" or traitors. \"I will rather anticipate a new confederacy, exempt from the corrupt and corrupting influence and oppression of the aristocratic Democrats of the South,\" wrote the prominent Massachusetts Federalist politician and U.S. Senator, Timothy Pickering, in 1803. \"There will be ... a separation,\" he predicted, and \"the white and black population will mark the boundary.\" \u201cHis colleague, Senator James Hillhouse, agreed, saying, \"The Eastern States must and will dissolve the Union and form a separate government.\" \"The Northern States must be governed by Virginia or must govern Virginia, and there is no middle ground,\" warned the conspiratorial Aaron Burr, who joined the New England Federalists in a secessionist plot (discussed below).\u201c \u201cThese \"Yankee Confederates\" were not an isolated band of radicals. They were among the leaders of the Federalist Party, many of whom had participated in the Revolutionary War and had even helped write the U.S. Constitution. John Hancock and Samuel Adams are among the best known of the New England Federalists who, by the early nineteenth century, were reaching their twilight years. The push for secession came primarily from the younger generation of Federalist leaders, including George Cabot, Elbridge Gerry, Theophilus Parsons, Timothy Pickering, Theodore Sedgwick, John Quincy Adams, Fisher Ames, Harrison Gray Otis, Josiah Quincy, and Joseph Story, among others. \u201cTheir cause, moreover, was virtually identical to the southern Confederacy's, a half century later: they were defending the principles of states' rights and self-government from an overbearing federal government. They condemned the Jefferson administration as being plagued by \"falsehood, fraud, and treachery,\" which induced \"oppression and barbarity\" and \"ruin among the nations.\" \u201cThey believed that the South -- especially Virginia -- was gaining too much wealth, power, and influence, and was using that influence against New England politically. Their complaints are virtually identical to John C. Calhoun's concerns, decades later, about the unjust regional impacts of excessive federal power. \u201cThe Federalists also believed strongly that homogeneity of race, and \"ethnic purity,\" were essential ingredients of a successful republic. These New Englanders thought of themselves as \"choice offspring of the choicest people, unpolluted by foreign blood.\" \u201cNew England Federalists were almost universally of English descent. Most of them agreed with William Smith Shaw that \"the grand cause of all our present difficulties may be traced . . . to so many hordes of Foreigners immigrating to America.\"10 \"Our progenitors were choice scions from the best English stock,\" added Federalist William Cunningham. Their \"natural wants\" did not \"force them here for subsistence, like the wild Irish and sour Germans in Pennsylvania.\" And, in a widely cited if not celebrated remark, William Stoughton stated that \"God sifted a whole Nation that he might send choice Grain over into this wilderness.\" \u201cGiven these strong feelings about the primacy and importance of ethnic purity, the Jeffersonian policy of expansionism -- especially the Louisiana Purchase which incorporated \"hordes of foreigners\" into the U.S. -- was an abomination to the Federalists. Josiah Quincy was one of the most respected and influential of the Federalists. He warned that the Louisiana Purchase obligated the nation to assimilate \"a number of French and Spanish subjects, whose habits, manners, and ideas of civil government are wholly foreign to republican institutions.\"Quincy felt so strongly about this that he clearly stated that if the purchase were consummated the only recourse for New England would be secession. For the purchase meant that the bonds of this Union are virtually dissolved; that the States which compose it are free from their moral obligation; and that, as it will be the right of all, so it will be the duty of some, to prepare definitely for a separation, amicably if they can, violently if they must. \u201cThe Federalists, as well as the Jeffersonians, understood that the Constitution was a carefully considered compact between the states which formed the union for certain well-defined reasons. Any measure that would fundamentally alter its relationships without a formal amendment would require consent of the parties to the compact. But the Louisiana Purchase was carried out by Jefferson and twenty-six senators -- without consulting Congress, and without first attaining any such agreement among the states. Many of the Federalists considered this to be a gross violation of the compact that made a mockery of states' rights.\u201d \u201cIt was at this point in history -- in 1803 -- that the New England Federalists began discussing secession. The ring leader was Pickering, who was among the most prominent of the Federalists. He had been elected colonel of the Essex County (Massachusetts) Militia at the outset of the American Revolution, and later served as adjutant general and quartermaster general of the Revolutionary Army. After the revolution, he was a member of Congress, Secretary of War, and U.S. Senator from Massachusetts.\u201c \u201cIn a letter to George Cabot, Pickering wrote of the \"depravity\" of Jefferson's \"plan of destruction\" and concluded that \"the principles of our Revolution [the Revolution of 1776] point to the remedy -- a separation. That this can be accomplished, and without spilling one drop of blood, I have little doubt.\" \u201c Pickering believed that the different cultures of the North and South were inherently incompatible and would only lead to perpetual political conflict, if not violence. \"The people of the East cannot reconcile their habits, views, and interests with those of the South and West.\" \u201cPickering undoubtedly had in mind the clear cultural differences among different sets of British immigrants that historian David Hackett Fischer outlined in his treatise, Albion's Seed.17 Fischer charts four distinct migrations to the U.S. from England: the exodus of Puritans from the east of England to Massachusetts from 1629-1640; the migration, from 1642 to 1675 of \"a small Royalist elite and large numbers of indentured servants\" to Virginia; a movement from the North Midlands of England and Wales to the Delaware Valley between 1675-1725; and the flow of English-speaking people from North Britain and Ireland to Appala-chia from 1718-1775.\u201c \u201cThese four groups had much in common, but were also very different in their religion, social ranks, history, language or dialect, folkways, and perhaps most importantly, their conceptions of \"order, power, and freedom.\"18 And these were just the differences among the four British cultures in Colonial America. Dutch, Spanish, French, and other immigrants created even more diversity. The Federalists, however, were stridently opposed to multicultural assimilation. They thought secession and a truly federal system of government was necessary to avoid violent clashes among these incompatible cultures. These men, being of European ancestry, understood fully how ethnic divisions had historically been the source of much slaughter and strife, as indeed they still are today.\u201c \u201cBut this cultural incompatibility need not extend to commercialrelationships. Pickering and other Federalists thought the creation of a northern confederacy would be economically beneficial to both North and South, while eliminating much of the political conflict that would inevitably occur under a more centralized governmental regime. \"A Northern confederacy would unite congenial characters, and present a fairer prospect of public happiness; while the Southern States, having a similarity of habits, might be left to manage their affairs in their own way.\" Secession would \"render a friendly and commercial intercourse\" between North and South, for the southern states would probably want to contract out for such things as naval protection by the northern confederacy, while the products of the South would \"be important to the navigation and commerce of the North.\" \u201cSome historians have portrayed Pickering and his colleagues as crackpots or traitors because of their secessionist views, but all they were really advocating is an American continent organized more along the lines of modern Switzerland, with its twenty-six cantons, than the highly-centralized mega-state the U.S. has become. In Switzerland, there are \"long-standing and deep linguistic, cultural and religious divisions -- French, Swiss-German, Italian, and a local language, Romansh, plus several dialects.\" These differences are typical of Europe and have been the source of violence and bloodshed there for centuries.\u201c \u201cWhat is unique about Switzerland is that despite these differences, it has enjoyed a much higher degree of peace, harmony, and prosperity than most of the rest of Europe over the past 150 years. One likely reason for this is that the Swiss have in common \"their political will to lead a free and independent life and to resist the imposition of foreign laws -- and especially foreign taxes.\"The Swiss system of highly decentralized and autonomous cantons greatly facilitates this goal. Something like the Swiss system seems to be exactly what the New England secessionists had in mind.\u201c \u201cIn 1804, the New England Federalists began plotting their strategy. In a letter to Theodore Lyman, Pickering explained that Massachusetts would \"take the lead\" in secession, upon which time \"Connecticut would instantly join,\" as would New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania \"east of the Susquehanna River.\" \u201cPickering and his associates decided that New York was the key to persuading all New England states to secede as a block. They struck a deal with Aaron Burr: the party apparatus would do all it could to help Burr get elected governor of New York, and in turn, Burr would see to it that New York promptly seceded and became part of the northern confederacy.\u201c \u201cThe election was very close, with Burr losing by only 7,000 votes, and exceptionally bitter, with Burr's opponent, Alexander Hamilton, denouncing him as lacking in integrity, dangerous, intemperate, profligate, and dictatorial.\u201d \u201cAfter the election, Burr demanded an apology, and when Hamilton refused, Burr challenged him to a duel. Burr won the duel, killing his adversary with one shot, and became a pariah. Hamilton was so well liked and respected throughout the United States that Burr could barely appear in public. The entire nation mourned the death of one of its founding fathers as \"more memorial services were held in New England than ever had been held for a native son.\" \u201cBecause of Burr's association with the Federalists, the death of Hamilton discredited and temporarily stopped the New England secession movement.\u201c \u201cAll during this episode, virtually no one questioned the right of any state to secede. Any objections that were raised were strictly utilitarian -- the timing was not right, the economic benefits might have been overestimated, and so on. Jefferson himself announced in his first inaugural address that \"if there be any among us who wish to dissolve the Union or to change its republican form, let them stand undisturbed, as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.\" \u201cJefferson was the co-author (with James Madison) of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798, which suggested that \"where powers were assumed by the national government which had not been granted by the States, nullification is the rightful remedy\" and that every state has an original, natural right \"to nullify of its own authority all assumptions of power by others, within its limits.\" \u201cThus, both major political parties believed in the inviolable states' rights of nullification and secession in the early nineteenth century\u201c ",
