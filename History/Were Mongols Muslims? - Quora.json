            "answer_text": "Quite a lot of them, actually. I am in fact a living testament to the fact. Mongols have variously embraced different religions including Islam and Nestorian Christianity stretching back to the Middle Ages. As they began to conquer the rest of Northern Asia, particularly the western part of it, they ended up integrating the various Turkic tribes, like the Qipchaks, who would had been Muslim for more than 300 years by that point. I recall one of the Khaans of the Altan Orda, Berke I think, having come across a group of Sufis from Khwarezm. The Khaan remarked that Iranians were cowards and that his hunting dogs were worth far more honour. However, the Iranians\u2019 response that this would only be true if they deviated from Shariah impressed Berke that he questioned them further about Islam and eventually became a Muslim. The rest of the Mongols in Altan Orda quickly followed suit, thus leading to the entire northwestern wing of the Ikh Mongol Uls to become a Muslim polity. Similar things happened in the Il-Khanate and the Ulus of Tsagadai. It is worth noting that these were all thoroughly Islamic places and the Mongols were ever a minority in the lands they conquered (indeed, the Mongols have always been a numerically small people in comparison to the other tribes of the steppes, though they have historically compensated for their smallness of numbers with their manliness and ferocity. Not for nothing does the word Mongol mean \u2018the brave ones\u2019). It stood to reason that they would eventually assimilate to the dominant Islamic culture of Central Asia and the Middle East even as the sons of Tolui submitted to Chinese culture in the Ulus of Ogedei. There\u2019s also a story that makes the rounds in Central Asia about how after having saluted the bravery of the exiled prince of Khwarezm, Jalaluddin Mingburnu, in Afghanistan, Chinggis Khaan himself is said to have visited the chieftains of Boxoro in what is now modern-day Uzbekistan and questioned them about Islam. Purportedly, he liked what he heard about it, except for the practice of Hajj which he found to be unneccesary. ",
