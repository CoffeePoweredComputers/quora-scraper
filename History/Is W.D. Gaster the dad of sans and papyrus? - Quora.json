            "answer_text": "Okay here is CONFIRMED info about Wing Dings 1.He was Asgore's former scientist that's described as \u201cbrilliant\u201d. 2.He was so brilliant that Asgore waited very long before looking for a new scientist because of Gaster's brilliance was\u201d irreplaceable\u201d. 4.He built the CORE,source of electricity for the whole underground. 3.\u201dHis life was cut short as he fell into one of his creations because\u201dhis experiments went wrong\u201d. 4.Thus he \u201cshattered across time and space\u201d. 5.He has his own followers showing how popular he was. 6.He wrote the ENTRY NUMBER SEVENTEEN given that it code is \u201cobj_gaster_room\u201d,confirming that it was written by him.This entry shows that Gaster experimenting with darkness and shows his obsession over absolute darkness and eventually shows that he has a connection with two characters. 7.He has his own theme 8.He's always associated with 6 number in the game's code 9.He's still listening 10.Naming the fallen human after him will result a game's crash Here all HEADCANONS 1.The most popular headcanon about him is that he's \u201cmystery man \u201cthat can be seen in waterfalls when your fun value is at 6.However,considering that Gaster \u201cshattered across time and space\u201d,it's very likely not Gaster ,or perhaps it's just a piece if him. 2.Another popular headcanon is that he's the brothers'father given the implications that he might be related to the brothers.But nothing confirm that he's necessarily their father as he could either be their grandpa,another brother or just a friend. 3.Another popular headcanon is that he's trapped in the void but not only it's never implied but it's directly contradicted by his follower who says that he's\u201dshattered across time and space\u201drather than being trapped in any void. 4.Another popular headcanon is that he's forgotten by everyone but none of his followers note it and his followers aswell as Asgore(who waited very long before getting a new scientist because of Gaster's brilliance when Gaster disappeared)still remember him. 5.Another headcanon that's not as popular as the previous ones is that Goner kid is related to Gaster given the fact that they looks like Gaster's followers and only appears in a specific fun value just like Gaster's followers.However,they never mention Gaster and it's never confirmed that they have any connection with him. And finally THEORIES(ideas endorced by some facts) 1.Considering that Sans's blasters are called \u201cGaster blasters\u201d,his scientific knowledge,that Papyrus implies using \u201cGaster blasters\u201dtoo,that Toby Fox confirmed that Papyrus and Sans has another \u201credacted\u201drelative and that Gaster,Sans and Papyrus are the only characters that speaks in a special front,the brothers likely have a connection with Gaster.Otherwise Toby simply had no reason to include those connections. 2.Toby Fox suggested that Gaster might be Sans and Papyrus's brother in of his tumblr's posts where Sans is talking to Frisk given this line: \"besides, it\u2019s rude to talk about people that are listening, right?Not everyone is as tough as my brother\u201d Considering that Papyrus isn't omniscient as Gaster is,the \u201cbrother\u201din question is very likely Gaster. 3.Gaster was likely alive when Chara fell,considering that the monsters settled the of rest the underground in the year 201X instead of continuing to hide in the ruins(since Toriel has a calendar from the year 201X in her house)and that the CORE is the source of electricity for the WHOLE underground and not just the ruins and that the only entrance to the CORE(Mettaton's hotel that was once just an apartments'building)was built in the year 2017 (as the memorial fountain was built this year). 4. It's implied that Gaster made some DT experiments given that Alphys doens't say that the DT extractor's blueprints aren\u201dhers\u201dbut just say \u201cTHE blueprints\u201dand as she wouldn't need any blueprints to use her own creation if she made the DT extractor machine. So it's likely that the DT extractor belonged to the former scientist aka Gaster.Plus combine it with the fact that the the true lab's generator seems to have a human soul in it,implying that Gaster secretly used a human soul for his DT experiments. 5. It seems like Gaster was somehow present during Alphys's dt experiments considering since his ENTRY NUMBER SEVENTEEN was written when Alphys was experimenting with DT. It's also important to note that Alphys's entry 17 is missing in the game and is only present in the strings as if Toby Fox deliberately wanted to confuse us or imply that there's a connection.Perhaps it implies that Alphys wrote her own \u201centry 17\u201dwhen Gaster(along his entry)disappeared due to his experiment related with darkness. 6.If he was REALLY present during Alphys's experiments,why was he replaced by Alphys in the first place?Asgore wouldn't replaced Gaster if he knew that he was still alive,maybe somehow he lived in the true lab without anyone noticing him?But why would he ?How could Alphys not notice him if Gaster lived in the true lab? So i see only one logical explanation:remember of the machine in Sans's lab?It's heavily implied that it was made by Gaster since it blueprints are written in \u201cweird symbols\u201dand the only \u201cweird symbols\u201dpresent in the game is in the ENTRY NUMBER SEVENTEEN,implying that the blueprints are written in wing dings and thus that the machine belonged to Gaster.This machine is heavily implied to be a time travel machine given that Sans has a photo from the pacifist end before it's even taken near this machine.If then,it's likely that Gaster actually went in the future(approximately when Alphys was experimenting with DT) and thus he \u201cdisappeared\u201dsince then from his past timeline and thus Asgore hired a new scientist. 7.The darkness-related experiment is very likely the world's destruction given that Chara says that destroying the world turn it into an \u201cabyss\u201dthat's said to be \u201cdark\u201din the official japanese translation.If it's true,then it's likely the experiment that caused Gaster to \u201cshatter across time and space\u201d. 8.But what happened to his two companions during this experiment?Did they dissapear?Scattered across time and space like he did?Or perhaps used the time travel machine to return to a point in the past before this experiment ever occurred?(thus erased Gaster's entry 17 and Alphys replaced it with her own one)You know the machine that's actually in Sans's lab?Interestingly,Snowdin's shopkeeper says that the brothers \u201cjust appeared one day and asserted themselves\u201dimplying that they appeared from nowhere,implying that they are time travelers.On the top of that,Sans is constantly talking about\u201dcoming back home\u201d(it been confirmed that it's not the surface)implying that they aren't from the current timeline and thus are likely time travels,which implies that he and Papyrus were present during Gaster's experiment. So it's possible that Sans was trying to fix the machine in order to return to his original timeline with Papyrus and possibly to collect Gaster's fragments across many timelines to \u201cfix him\u201d(which is implied by the fact that he has a drawing of \u201cthree smiling people\u201din his lab)and finally return together to their original timeline.

            "answer_text": "You should watch Handplates, it's just a fan comic, and it's still being made\u2026 but there's nothing to deny that it could be cannon. The premise is that Gaster created Sans and Papyrus from the bones on his hands. In the comic, it explains the glow that Papyrus and Sans have and why Sans only has one eye that glows. It's responsible for his own emotional well-being. This is why Sans is depressed and doesn't have a lot of energy, his emotional well-being is low, while Papyrus has both eyes that can glow, but not seen in the cannon game of Undertale. Also, the fact that Gaster falls into his own creation. There's lost game files that can change the FUN value of the game to create different things appearing, mostly Gaster's followers. They all say similar things, that WD Gaster fell into the core, vanished without a trace. The Goner kid explained it better though. He didn't die\u2026. You simply stop existing when you fall into the core. Everything else continues as normal. If Sans and Papyrus are a part of Gaster, like bone spurs that grew from his hole hands, then it's possible that part of their souls would be \u201ccorrupted\u201d. Like the Snowdin shop keeper even says that Sans and Papyrus asserted themselves one day, meaning that they just appeared. It could be the reason for them to appear out of nowhere. Sans and Papyrus found the house, there's no mention of it being for sale as far as I'm aware of. It could be WD Gaster's house when he was the royal scientist. In the comic, there's only his stuff, there's not his name, all the memories are there from people who knew him, excluding him. In the characters' dreams is the only place that Gaster can communicate from a place called \u201cThe void\u201d. When you also edit the FUN values, you can encounter a door that is to a sectioned off room. This is what most people believe where Gaster is, all alone, cut off from the world, in the void. Most people believe in Deltarune that this is a game made by Gaster. Don't know what the door with the fire underneath the seem could mean either, if it relates to Sans' room\u2026 but maybe Sans' room is in another dimension? Who knows. That's just a theory\u2026.. an Undertale theory lol It's very possible we could get answers in Deltarune? But Chapter 2 might take a long time :( Edit: Also, when we get close to the core and call Papyrus, he gets all quiet and looks concerned. Withholding information could be dire to the situation, but I also think that Papyrus could be sad that you didn't hang out with him and Undyne. I haven't tried this again after the Undyne arc, but I think it's still the same result. Unresponsive and despondent. Perhaps Sand and Papyrus do know about Gaster in mysterious ways, or Papyrus has found a way to contact him in his dreams, as mentioned from handplates. Sand, however, might know about the alternative timelines, or is very observant about that sort of thing. There's theories that the blue prints could also be Alphys, and could be the prototype for Omega Flowey's form. There's also a photograph in Sans lab that has three people you don't recognize on it and the words \u201cdon't forget\u201d. Some speculate that this could be Kris, Ralsei, and Susie. This could also be all the main Undertale characters from a long time ago, OR\u2026 It could be Gaster, Sans, and Papyrus, from a different timeline/dimension. Remember that when you save monsters in the pacifist ending? When they can't remember you, they have blotchy faces. This could be why Gaster's face could be blotchy in the photograph? You can't recognize him because you can't recognize or even remember him because he DOESNT exist in the timeline we are in. ",
