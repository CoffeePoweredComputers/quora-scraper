            "answer_text": " (image from internet) That\u2019s assuming were talking \u201creal\u201d magic (i.e. psychic power derived the warp), unless the witch in question is one of these guys;  (image from games workshop) or her;  (image from games workshop) or him;  (image from games workshop) Then well that\u2019s totally different, don\u2019t you know citizen, and even thinking of drawing that comparison is heresy. If however we are talking simple show/stage magic; Then maybe they just ignore you (read; your not important enough to note, best case.)Maybe instead they arrest you (read; torture a confession for something or other from you.)Maybe they put a bolt round through your skull for clearly annoying someone so much more important that you.Or worse, you will be declared a heretic and burned (but luckily your friends and family are left out of it.)Or worse still, you are declared a heretic and burned along with your whole family and friends too.Or absolute worse case, you, your family, your city, it all burns too.The Imperium is not known for its open-mindedness and understanding, best not to meddle in anything that might be occult or heretical. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends. Are you talking about stage magician-style magic? Or Harry Potter/Gandalf/Warhammer Fantasy magic? Stage Magician? It depends on who and what you show it to. Regular people might be a bit suspicious, but would probably say \u201cWell, I don\u2019t understand how he did it, but it\u2019s fun to watch\u201d. The Inquisition, or anyone related to the Ecclesiarchy, would probably take you away to one of their quiet back rooms, with the sound-baffling walls, and spend a couple of weeks slowly trying to get you to convince to either being a psyker or a heretic, before letting you drop dead and killing your entire social circle for being associates of a suspected heretic. They might even nuke the Hive itself - it depends on how badly you pissed them off in interrogation. Actual magic? Oh boy. You\u2019ve just outed yourself as a Psyker, my friend, and a pretty powerful one if you\u2019re able to manipulate the real world using the power of the Warp. Clearly you\u2019ve also known about your abilities for a while and have been hiding them for nefarious purposes, probably to summon Daemons or Tyranids to the world. You\u2019re a heretic, a traitor of the highest order, and if the Inquisition can\u2019t suppress your powers or summarily BLAM! you with their trusty Comissar, then that\u2019s an Exterminatus that\u2019s a-cookin\u2019. You just destroyed your entire planet. Look. The Imperium is hardly the most rational authoritarian dystopia place at the best of times - and the Inquisition is a thousand times worse. Magic is basically just Psyker powers, in the world of 40K, and most Psyker\u2019s powers are limited to being able to read emotions or peer slightly into the Warp. Actual physical manifestations of your powers mean you\u2019re a pretty bloody powerful Psyker, and one with excellent control over your powers - which means you both hid your powers and trained them secretly. Given that most Psykers found in the Imperium are turned into psychic Soylent Green to feed the Astronomican (and, by extension, the Emperor\u2019s disintegrating soul on the Golden Throne), and those who aren\u2019t are either turned into Astropaths (basically glorified telephones who are treated as such) or put through fairly torturous training to ensure loyalty to the Imperium, if you\u2019ve been hiding your powers and training them it can only mean you\u2019re a filthy heretic who wants to summon the Chaos Gods to your planet, and thus are clearly deserving of death, and cleansing with fire to remove your influence. The Imperium is a fucked up place, and horrifically dystopian. ",
