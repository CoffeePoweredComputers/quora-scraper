            "answer_text": "It is extremely difficult to recommend a single book that does a good job of representing all Native American history and culture. The standard reference work (although not universally beloved) is the 15-volume Handbook of North American Indians published by the Smithsonian Institution. (Wikipedia: Handbook of North American Indians) Columbia University also has a good series that (from what I've seen) assumes no prior knowledge yet does not condescend or avoid complexity. I've used and recommended The Columbia Guide to American Indians of the Southeast. (Book info at LibraryThing) For an overview of Native American communities in the present-day U.S., you could do worse than to browse Tiller's Guide to Indian Country, which is just out in a new edition. It has the advantage of having been produced by and for Native people. It serves as a corrective to the commonplace view of Indians as a disappearing people from the past. (Profile of lead author Veronica Tiller (Jicarilla Apache)) For a solid intro to academic insights into Native history, there is Facing East from Indian Country: A Native History of Early America. The author, Daniel K. Richter, is an expert on Iroquois history, and the book focuses mainly on the Northeast and the colonial centuries while also making more general observations. Later chapters get down to specific New England cases. Next, one of the most influential studies ever written about American Indians is The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region, 1650-1815, by Richard White. This one set off the academic equivalent of pack journalism, with junior historians finding \"middle grounds\" all over the place, often using White's concepts with far less subtlety than White did. It's a model study that makes sense of apparent chaos (viz., the frontiers of New France, Anglo-America, and a kaleidoscope of Algonquian and Siouan nations), yet in my opinion it defies summary. And if you're not full yet, see the short but brilliant Indian Work: Language and Livelihood in Native American History, by Daniel H. Usner Jr. This one focuses on more recent historical eras while making a case for how assumptions about Indians have shaped mainstream American thinking about poverty and related problems. It is my single favorite book on the economic history of American Indians, yet it also finds time to forever change your view of D.H. Lawrence and the Taos artists' colony. All three of these books are impressively researched and beautifully written. Between them they almost cover the entire continental U.S. (I wish I could recommend a good book on Native California. Perhaps the recent controversy over the canonization of mission priest Jun\u00edpero Serra has inspired some ongoing work. ADD: See Al Carroll's answer to this question.) I am trying to avoid going on about my own obsessive interest, the Creek Nation in the Southeast. The Creek wars (1813-14 and 1836) with the southern United States were instrumental in transforming the Deep South from Indian country to slave country while catapulting Andrew Jackson to national fame. General histories often pass quickly over the Southeast as a zone purged of all Indian history by the \"Trail of Tears,\" but that's far too reductive. Besides the Columbia volume already mentioned, if I could recommend a single academic book on the Redstick War (or First Creek War), I'd go with Sacred Revolt: The Muskogees' Struggle for a New World, by Joel Martin, which approaches the subject as religious history. For a more general summary of early Native revolts against U.S. hegemony, there is A Spirited Resistance: The North American Indian Struggle for Unity, 1745-1815, by Gregory Evans Dowd. To approach the same matter from a revisionist military historian's perspective, see The First Way of War: American War Making on the Frontier, 1607-1814, by John Grenier. Or if you're curious about the relationship between frontier warfare and the development of \"white\" identity, read Our Savage Neighbors: How Indian War Transformed Early America, by Peter Silver, drawing insights from the history of the Pennsylvania colony in the Seven Years War. This is much more substantial fare than the ever-popular (but seldom finished, I suspect) Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. If you want to proceed further into the southern Indian past, I heartily recommend the interdisciplinary tour de force Choctaw Genesis, by Patricia Galloway. Also, anything by Kathryn H. Braund (for the Creek Nation) or Theda Perdue (for the Cherokees and southern Indian women more generally). And I'll force myself to stop talking about the South now. No list would be complete without recommending some books by American Indians. Almost anything by the late scholar-activist Vine Deloria Jr. (God Is Red; Custer Died for Your Sins) is worth your trouble, although at times he reads like a pro controversis controversialist. Philip Deloria's Playing Indian is brilliant cultural history and very influential. Other scholars with more irreverent and deliberately accessible styles include humorist Paul Chaat Smith (Everything You Know about Indians Is Wrong) and legal scholar Robert Johnson (Savage Anxieties, which turns the tables on Western civilization by making sweeping generalizations from a Native perspective). There are also many more conventional academic studies by Native scholars, too many to list here, including some thought-provoking constructive criticism of conventional academic method. Finally, there are a few books produced by Indian sages, sometimes with the help of a \"white\" scholar. The most famous example is Black Elk Speaks, the words of a Lakota visionary as set down by John Neihardt in the 1930s. Other such books have to be regarded with caution, as they include work by \"plastic shamans\" and academic hucksters like Carlos Castaneda. An interesting, legit example from my region is Creek Indian Medicine Ways: The Enduring Power of Mvskoke Religion, by David Lewis Jr. (a Creek kithla or medicine man) and Ann T. Jordan (an anthropologist). ",

            "answer_text": "The definitive work I would recommend that shows the spirit of Native Americans, as well as the defeat they suffered, is the classic, \"Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee\". From Amazon, (I will leave the URL to connect t it,) it tells the story of the plight of Native Americans, and their struggles more eloquently than any text on the issue I have read. It is all fact, not fiction, and of course, opinions will be beckoned by any reader. It is not apologist, it is a story, and if there was one book to read to summarize the destruction of Native American Tribes and their territories, this is the seminal creed. IMO. AMAZON: \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, is Dee Brown's classic, eloquent, meticulously documented account of the systematic destruction of the American Indian culture during the second half of the nineteenth century. A national bestseller in hardcover for more than a year after its initial publication, it has sold over four million copies in multiple editions and has been translated into seventeen languages.Using council records, autobiographies, and firsthand descriptions, Brown allows great chiefs and warriors of the Dakota, Ute, Sioux, Cheyenne, and other tribes to tell us in their own words of the series of battles, massacres, and broken treaties that finally left them and their people demoralized and decimated. A unique and disturbing narrative told with force and clarity, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee changed forever our vision of how the West was won, and lost. It tells a story that should not be forgotten, and so must be retold from time to time.\" To purchase, follow this link, to those that dare to read it, it is heartbreaking: Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West: Dee Brown, Hampton Sides: http://www.amazon.com/Bury-My-Heart-Wounded-Knee/dp/0805086846/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1432706339&sr=8-1&keywords=bury+my+heart+at+wounded+knee ",
