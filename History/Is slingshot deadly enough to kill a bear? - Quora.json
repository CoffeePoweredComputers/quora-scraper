            "answer_text": "As a weapon no however it's a bit convoluted but you can kill a bear using a slingshot. First one needs to find a bear and get good and close\u2026 close enough to make sure you don't miss. Then step out into the open and let the poor bear have it! At this point the now confused and most likely pissed off bear will most likely charge and kill you. This having been done the authorities will very unfairly, have to hunt down and destroy i.e. kill the poor thing\u2026even though it's not guilty of anything but attacking in self defense a very cruel and stupid jackass that didn't know enough to not go out and piss-off a bear. And so with a slingshot being used the world will have lost a perfectly good bear to the unfortunate rules of the human beings and one idiot to\u2026.let's just say natural selection. It's not to different from the killing of a wild bear by feeding it\u2026.{killing a bear with marshmallows etc.}. Certainly not a very good trade off for any of us\u2026.especially the bear. ",

            "answer_text": "No all you'd do is make him mad. The band's would have to be so stiff you couldn't pull it back. The only possible exception is my old wrist rocket would shoot arrows. So with top notch broadheads and excellent shot placement it would be possible. Advisable, NO. Possible yes. One rule of thumb, when using primitive weapons never shoot at a bear that knows where you are. Also I doubt a wrist rocket has a pull weight legal for bear. Lighter pull weight=lower velocity= less penetration of vital organs. All which means the bear doesn't die until after you're dead. I suppose in a desperate survival situation, from a treestand, with arrows. It's possible. ",
