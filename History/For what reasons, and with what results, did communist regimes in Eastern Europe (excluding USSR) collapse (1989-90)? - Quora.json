            "answer_text": "I have been studying the Romanian Revolution - on YouTube it\u2019s possible to find raw footage of the events in Bucharest and other cities in the critical period, as well as other periods such as the elections in May-June 1990, the Mineriad counter-protests, and so forth. It\u2019s clear to me the publicly portrayed story of that revolution is not accurate. It would have been so easy for the government to send in military and the whole result would have been very different (at the cost of many dead people). But they didn\u2019t and it seems \u201cthe fix\u201d was in, meaning that to some extent the events were directed from elsewhere. Consider also the unlikelihood that several neighboring countries would all be able to spontaneously rise up in revolt against communist regimes, all at the same time. Why did that string of countries switch from communism to \u201cdemocracy\u201d one after another? Isn\u2019t that by itself a sign that the whole thing was directed from elsewhere? In Romania the official story is: In early December 1989, the Romanian government wanted to expel an ethnic-Hungarian priest who lived in Timisoara, but the locals rose up to protect him. Some of the locals were killed for their efforts, and that just caused more protests.By December 21, 1989, news of this had reached elsewhere in the country including Bucharest. On that morning Ceaucescu had a big speech with lots of cheering people just as he\u2019d done many times before. But this time the speech was interrupted by disgruntled shouting from the audience. Within an hour that turned into street protests that spun out of control.Shortly (IIRC on December 22), Ceaucescu and a small entourage escaped in a helicopter. By that time there were large scale protests in Bucharest.They were quickly captured and brought to a facility in Targoviste, and on December 25 they were executed after a brief trial.By the next summer open elections were held, the Communist party was banned, etc.I do not believe that actual events were as simple as that official story would have us believe. But let\u2019s get back to late December 1989. The videos I\u2019ve found on YouTube show three separate tracks of events. Street protests \u2014 People in the street were joyfully and jubilantly shouting slogans like \u201cNu sunt tsovarich, sunt Roman\u201d (We are not Tsovarich\u2019s, we are Romanians). They danced, held speeches, set up barricades, there was street fighting, with nearly 2000 people killed in the street, etc. The main focus seems to have been the downtown area, and the area around the TVR building.Power brokers \u2014 There\u2019s a room behind the balcony from which Ceaucescu made that speech. Once he vacated the scene, there was an intense discussion in that room with many power brokers including Military and Political. Some of them were insurgents, but others were Communist Party holdovers - like Ion Iliescu.TVR Studios \u2014 Over at the TVR studios there was a struggle for control over the message being presented on the television. Some of the videos show the intense struggle off-camera for that control.I\u2019m thinking that the people in the street thought they had the power, and it was their actions that toppled the government. You can see it in their faces in these videos, they\u2019re scared, uncertain, but also full of power. But taken as a whole, the discussions in those Power Broker venues could have turned out a lot different. Was there some outside influence that controlled the outcome in Romania? Obviously I think that\u2019s the case since Romania\u2019s revolution occurred in the context of the others which had happened. One documentary I watched made it clear that Iliescu and collaborators had planned the revolution at least a year ahead of time, and had discussed with other countries the likely response. Finally\u2026 while the Communist Party was officially banned, the parties that took its place were usually controlled by folks who had been high ranking Communist Party members. That means the country was still being run by Communists, but they weren\u2019t allowed to use the name Communist Party. This apparently did not sit well with a large chunk of the population. Hence, the protests continued long after the revolution, with a protest camp still in place in June 1990. Romania is still working to fix that problem. PSD is widely recognized as either the strongest or second strongest party, and is largely made up of former Communists. To me as an outsider it looks like PSD\u2019s rule of Romania has not been good, and has kept Romania from being well organized. ",

            "answer_text": "There where many differences in political systems. A big difference was the ability to produce the perceived needs for the people. In Eastern Europe the Iron Curtain dissappeared, so the people could see how the needs of people where fulfilled in the west. They wanted that too. But the system there was not able to deliver that. It was political driven in the east, as the system in the west was driven by political democratic insights and the needs for products and services from all people, not some commissions. So twofold reasons: unability to produce AND lack of perceived freedom. ",
