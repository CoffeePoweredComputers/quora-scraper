            "answer_text": "The answer is more complex than often presented. Joseph Glatthaar, in this book:  claims the following: Among the enlistees in 1861, slightly more than one in ten owned slaves personally. This compared favorably to the Confederacy as a whole, in which one in every twenty white persons owned slaves. Yet more than one in every four volunteers that first year lived with parents who were slaveholders. Combining those soldiers who owned slaves with those soldiers who lived with slaveholding family members, the proportion rose to 36 percent. That contrasted starkly with the 24.9 percent, or one in every four households, that owned slaves in the South, based on the 1860 census. Thus, volunteers in 1861 were 42 percent more likely to own slaves themselves or to live with family members who owned slaves than the general population. One in every ten volunteers in 1861 did not own slaves themselves but lived in households headed by non family members who did. This figure, combined with the 36 percent who owned or whose family members owned slaves, indicated that almost one of every two 1861 recruits lived with slaveholders. Thus, most of the young men in the first wave were not slave owners but were closely connected to someone that did. Slavery was a massive source of wealth and was the owners were the ruling class in the South. Indeed, it was undeniably a way of life. This still means, the majority of men that fought for the South were not slave owners or directly linked to slave ownership. Thus, these men were fighting against own interests. How so, you ask? Slave owners occupy the best land and free labor cannot compete with slave labor based on cost. Thus, the majority of confederates were fighting to make themselves poorer. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone who had a plantation own slaves. Robert E Lee was a plantation owner and a slave owner. In the south as in the north rich people could get out of the army by either providing a substitute someone paid to take their place or the case of the south proving that they had a certain number of slaves. Many of the people in the Confederate armies may have had only one or two slaves and been small farmers some of them were small farmers with no slaves at all. Read Ken Burns\u05f3s Book the Civil War or see the television series on PBS. Soldier when asked why he was fighting set because you\u2019re here. Not a direct quote but close enough. As I stated anyone with a working plantation almost always had slaves because they were the the work force. So yes some people in the Confederate armies were slaveowners and plantation owners and just poor farmers at the end of the war some Were convicts Yes sometimes gone with the wind does get it right others were children perhaps 12 or 15 years of age. General Lee may have been on the wrong side and fighting for the wrong ideology but he was by on all accounts a gentlemen in his time. Jesse James what is a \u201cgorilla\u201d and an outlaw. Kind of gives you a range of what the Southern soldier was like. ",
