            "answer_text": "Well, adding the disclaimer of literally every civilization being morally questionable, from West Africans\u2019 slave trade to Timurids\u2019\u2026 Timur, going through the Chinese lingchi & French wars on religion, the sins of the Aztecs could be: Keeping their dominions & subjugated peoples threatened at all times. This is why chiefdoms like the Totonacan Cempoala allied with the Spaniards.Keeping their \u2018enemies\u2019 in a constant state of warfare. Tlaxcala is the best example, but it\u2019s not the only one; virtually every bordering country suffered some sort of incursion: From the Yope tribes to the South to the Purepecha Kingdom to the West.Human sacrifices & Garland Wars. There were ritual wars in which the only objective was to capture enemy warriors, for them to be sacrificed at the top of the pyramid.Wearing their enemies\u2019 skin. Once, in their beginnings, the Tenochca (preferred name for the Aztecs) lured a chief from a kingdom that offered them asylum to offer his daughter in marriage. They killed her, dressed a boy with her skin & had her father look at the malicious boy \u201cdancing\u201d.Cannibalism. In today Mexico there is a dish called \u201cpozole\u201d. Well, that\u2019s a prehispanic delicasy that today is prepared with pork or chicken\u2026 but, there were neither pork nor chicken available to the Aztecs, right? ",

            "answer_text": "Bad? Why do you say they were bad? What is bad? They were actually very successful and had much prosperity. On the cusp of a golden age until\u2026yano\u2026Europe happened to them. All of the negative stigma of Mesoamerican civilization is either misunderstood or greatly exaggerated. No civilization is good or bad. There are always customs and aspects of them that are considered in hindsight to be morally atavistic but you can simply call a culture bad. Much less a large imperial civilization. Are we speaking of human sacrifice? Certainly to our \u201cold world\u201d sensibilities then it seems horrifying. Are we speaking of the subjugation of many city states around the valley of Mexico? That certainly seems terrible. But the European pagans practiced human sacrifice up until the Christianization of the north and perhaps beyond. Not to mention the horrible persecution of different religious groups and subgroups at that exact time. As for the subjugation of other groups, the \u201cold world\u201d basically perfected that and continue it in a slightly different fashion to this day. The Aztecs weren\u2019t \u201cbad\u201d they were different from anything Europe had ever known, seen or imagined. Their customs seemed(and seem to us now) horrifying..and yet at their core are not much different than what was going on in Europe, Africa and Asia(both East and West) at the time. ",
