            "answer_text": "You know I attended several investment strategy conference for \u201chigh net worth customers\u201d both in Jan 2019 and Jan 2020, I can\u2019t tell you about 2020 because I can\u2019t predict future, I can tell you about the results of 2019 though: At most 20% of their \u201cprophecies\u201d became true, which means 80% of their predictions turned out garbage. And those poeple are professional economists and investors who earned millions dollars every year. They couldn\u2019t even predict everything in the first 3 months\u2014-China\u2019s stock market index went from 2440 to 3288. What they told me was it was gonna be a bull market for a WHOLE year. Bull***t, the index of shanghai stock market was 3050.12 on Dec 31st, 2019 That\u2019s just one tiny aspect of China\u2019s economy in just ONE year, and they were completely wrong about it. Whoever under this question tells you that China\u2019s economy is gonna survive or not is lying to you. The world might be a very different place 100 years later, the 200+ countries we see today might not be the same then. What I do know is China\u2019s going to have severe demographic issue 20 years later.  It\u2019s not about sheer size of population, it\u2019s about population structure. China could still maintian a population of 1.3 billion 20 years later, but 1/4 of them will be 65+. Compared to Turkey\u2019s demographic struture:  Aging means less workers, less innovation(unless you\u2019re developing healthcare robot) and more people need care, empty social security. All of them are impact on economy and I\u2019m not seeing any signs of improvement. Let\u2019s survive the first 20 years then we talk about later. Cheers ",

            "answer_text": "NOBODY can predict the future that far, but everyone should dream -  CHINA has been around for 5000 years. Will it still be around next century, and strong? You bet. Strengths of China? Super long history, rich deep culture (rooted in Confucian ethics), and strength and homogeneity of a unitary civilisation state, and of course people - a huge smart and diligent population. \u201cAmong the major drivers for China\u2019s success are the Chinese people, the true creator of China\u2019s economic success and the great culture that shapes their characteristics: ambitious, hardworking, thrifty, caring for their families and relentlessly pursuing good education and success.\u201d Wait. \u201cDon\u2019t Japan and Korea have these too?\u201d (And Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong for most). YES, they have similar traits. But China has something those don\u2019t have. A strong authoritarian central government like CPC, (high performance core CPU), is part of the winning formula (heck, let pro-democracy nuts, pro-freedom freaks scream murder).Strengths of China\u2019s State and Governance Systems in the Eyes of Foreign Political Party Leaders How China governs.And stellar size. CHINA like both the USA and India will have the advantages of size; always be around unless something really disastrous happens. A big guy is hard to bully and suppress.WHAT can we tell over the last 2000 years?  Yes, China always was one of the top economies (with India, and the Roman Empire), except for a brief period of about a hundred years. It fell somewhat in that dark chaotic period, plus another key reason - a few industrialised nations grew rapidly and surpassed a stagnated and weakened China in chaos. After an explosive growth over 4 decades, China by 2014 re-claimed number 1 (PPP) and will likely hold pole position for the rest of this century, (barring a crazy war or a crisis within China domestically). As for the next 100 years? We would never know for sure. But below shows a glimpse based on basic assumptions of stability without severe disruptions. The GDP 2018 to 2100 Based on conservative understanding without any major upheaval (which itself would be a miracle), the world GDP would put China at the top, with India close behind, and USA remaining 3rd.  STABILITY vs CHAOS: China will more than others persist like it always has, but in what political or economic form is unclear. Throughout its long history, a fundamental prerequisite for growth and prosperity is stability - and the absence of chaos (geopolitics and wars, rebellions and wide spread discontent). Other big unknowns? Technology disruption (advanced high tech, AI, robotics), population (size, socio-economics) challenges and possibly climatic impact. CONCLUSION I believe China will persists in the next century with a strong economy. However, the next 5 to 10 years are crucial for China: The USA factor:Can USA constrain a rising China?Can both avoid a major Cold War or a hot war due to Thucydides trap?Can China manage her crucial relationship with this tough \u2018adversary\u2019. Despite the challenges imposed by US (allies in the West), can China beat the Middle Class trap - a risk that China must overcome, and the signs are she can.Can China ensure stability and growth to achieve her 2049 goal through economics transformation, One Belt and perhaps political adjustments to manage her own demographics, debt and socio-economics challenges.And ending with a quote: \u201cChina\u2019s success is built upon an inseparable three-legged stool: Pro-development government policies, learning from the West, and great cultural values that help create highly motivated and competitive human capital. Today, the global economic rivalry is not only a competition on governance of a nation, but also a competition on its human capital and cultural values. Any nation who wants to advance their economies needs address both.\u201d  OTHER REFERENCES GDP 1880 to 2040  Video: 35 Years of World Economic Evolution in 20 Seconds Attached a peak into what the populations could look like. China could peak at between 1.4 to 1.5 billion, and then slide back to 1.1 billion. India could overtake as early as 2025 which will then rise to a possible 1.5 or even 1.7 billion.
