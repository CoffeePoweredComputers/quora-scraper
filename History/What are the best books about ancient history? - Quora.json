            "answer_text": "Personally, I really enjoyed Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari. Sapiens \u2013 A Brief History of Humankind, by Yuval Noah Harari, examines the following fact: one hundred thousand years ago, there were six species of humans. Today, there are just one species of humans. Some questions Sapiens asks and answers: How did Homo Sapiens succeed in lasting throughout time? Why did Homo Sapiens go from groups of hunter-gathers to living in cities and nations? What makes Homo Sapiens unique to the animal kingdom?  Sapiens is broken up into four sections: The first section examines what Harari calls the \u201cCognitive Revolution\u201d. The Cognitive Revolution describes the time period where humans\u2019 brains developed and humans could now make tools and become more efficient in their work. The second section examines the Agricultural Revolution. Many of us know what occurred during this time period: humans went mainly hunting and gathering for their food to growing crops, domesticating various animals, and becoming sedentary. The third section is called \u201cThe Unification of Humankind\u201d. In this section, Harari looks at the social structures which have been put in place to unify humankind. Some of these structures include religion and nations. Here, Harari introduces his concept of the \u201cImagined Myth\u201d (more on this later). Finally, in the final section, called \u201cScientific Revolution\u201d, Harari looks at the recent past and talks about economic constructs, such as communism or capitalism, technological developments, and how the industrial revolution transformed the world once again. At the end of Sapiens, Harari tries to answer a few deep questions: Have we become happier as history has unfolded? With technological development and increases in efficiency of housing and food production, have we become happier? If we wanted to, could we break free from the influence of our ancestors? There are many questions Harari poses for the reader to think about. It will be interesting in the future as we continue to evolve. Interesting stuff, I\u2019d recommend it. ",

            "answer_text": "The History of the Ancient World : From the Earliest Accounts to the Fall of Rome Susan Wise Bauer (2007)  The Oxford Classical Dictionary Simon Hornblower (first published 1949) For more than half a century, the Oxford Classical Dictionary has been the unrivaled one-volume reference work on the Greco-Roman world. Whether one is interested in literature or art, philosophy or law, mythology or science, intimate details of daily life or broad cultural and historical trends, the OCD is the first place to turn for clear, authoritative information on all aspects of ancient culture. Greek History: The Basics Robin Osborne (2004). A very short, compressed primer on Greek history from the Dark Age up to the Roman conquest, written by one of the top experts.  Ancient Greece: A History in Eleven Cities Cartledge, Paul Anthony ( 2009) Designed for a non-expert audience, but again by a top expert, this book uses a series of microhistories to tell a story of Greece's history from the Dark Age to the Byzantine Empire.  \u2014 .  The Aegean Bronze Age Dickinson, Oliver ( 1994) A comprehensive synthesis of a wide range of data, useful for beginners and researchers alike.  The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe Ca. 1200 B.C. - Third Edition Drews, Robert ( 1993) This is the only halfway decent book on the Bronze Age collapse that affected Greece, Anatolia, and Syria. Drews' rebuttal of some widely-accepted theories on the collapse is the most useful part. His own argument, that the collapse was caused by changes in military practice, is much less useful (though his theory is at least no worse than its competitors).  \u1d05\u1d00\u0280\u1d0b \u1d00\u0262\u1d07 \u1d00\u0274\u1d05 \u1d00\u0280\u1d04\u029c\u1d00\u026a\u1d04 \u1d18\u1d07\u0280\u026a\u1d0f\u1d05 (\u1d04. 1100 \u2013 \u1d04. 479 \u0299\u1d04) Archaic Period (c. 800- 479 BCE)[1] Greek Dark Ages c. 1100 \u2013 c. 800 BC[2]  Archaic Greece: The Age of Experiment by Snodgrass, Anthony ( 1980) A classic book: though it has been superceded in some ways, this can probably be regarded as embodying the conservative orthodoxy on the period.  The Trojans and their Neighbours Trevor Bryce (2006) Though focused on Troy, this is currently the best book that deals with the relationship between Bronze Age Greeks and the peoples of Anatolia.  Greece in the Making 1200-479 BC Osborne, Robin ( 1996) One of the definitive surveys of Dark Age and Archaic Greece.  A Companion to Archaic Greece Kurt Raaflaub and Hans van Wees (2009). A thorough guide with over thirty chapters written by world experts.  (TEXTBOOK) A History of the Archaic Greek World: ca. 1200-479 BCE by Hall, Jonathan ( 2006) Another of the definitive histories of Dark Age and Archaic Greece, by one of the greatest living historians of the period. \"Scholars as well as students of historical practice and specialists in Greek history will find this book indispensable \u2026 Highly recommended.\" (Choice) \"Very attractive physical appearance \u2026 an extensive bibliography and index. Hall\u2019s style is clear and crisp \u2026 .The book is to be recommended.\" (Canadian Journal of History)  CLASSICAL PERIOD (479 TO 323 BCE)[3]  (upper-level undergraduates textbook) A History of the Classical Greek World: 478-323 BC P.J. Rhodes (2006). Partner to Jonathan Hall's textbook on Archaic Greece, listed above. Both provide accessible and up-to-date overviews of the period they cover. \u201cA leading authority on Athens, Rhodes has written a superbnarrative of Classical Greece for upper-level undergraduates:lucid, concise, and balanced. Welcome additions to the secondedition are chapters on life and culture, and brief selections fromcontemporary sources.\u201d (undergraduates textbook) The Greek World 479-323 BC Hornblower, Simon ( 1983) A frequently used overview, written by a top scholar. Hornblower also pays a nice amount of attention to cities other than Athens and Sparta. `To write a standard history which contains the essential material and yet is interesting and says things which have not been said before is one of the hardest tasks. Hornblower has performed it excellently.' - Times Literary Supplement `Packed with worthwhile ideas and impressive erudition. It will stimulate thought'. - David Whitehead, Classical Review `An undergraduate text book which neither the professional ancient historian can afford to ignore nor the interested non specialist fail to read with profit and pleasure' - History Today  ( )[4]  (TEXTBOOK) The Greek World After Alexander 323-30 BC by Shipley, Graham ( 1999) An introduction to the Hellenistic Period. For more in-depth detail, the researcher will still need to go to Peter Green's enormous Alexander to Actium (1990). \"the seventh volume to appear in Routledge 'History of the Ancient World' series is clearly and sensibly written, has an excellent and original selection of tables, maps, diagrams, and photographs, and provides and thorough, reliable, and up-to-date introduction to key topics.--Zofia H. Archibald, University of Liverpool.\"  (TEXBOOK) Thundering Zeus: The Making of Hellenistic Bactria by Holt, Frank L. ( 1999) A good introduction to Greek culture outside of its traditional homelands, and more specifically Greek cultures of the Hellenistic era. Well researched, and highly current.  A Companion to the Hellenistic World by Erskine, Andrew ( 2003) A thorough guide with nearly thirty chapters written by world experts.  Alexander the Great in His World by Thomas, Carol G. ( 2006) A fairly academic but very good biography of Alexander. \u201cAn engaging and persuasive book, which offers a newperspective \u2026 .It will maintain the interest of specialists\u2026 yet remain accessible to the general reader.\u201dCanadian Journal of History   Troy Between Greece and Rome: Local Tradition and Imperial Power by Erskine, Andrew ( 2001) In this book Andrew Erskine examines the role and meaning of Troy in the changing relationship between Greeks and Romans, as Rome is transformed from a minor Italian city into a Mediterranean superpower. The book seeks to understand the significance of Rome's Trojan origins for the Greeks by considering the place of Troy and Trojans in Greek culture. It moves beyond the more familiar spheres of art and literature to explore the countless, overlapping, local traditions, the stories that cities told about themselves, a world often neglected by scholars. \"A detailed and spirited sifting of evidence.\"--Times Higher Education Supplement  Greek Literature and the Roman Empire: The Politics of Imitation by Whitmarsh, Tim ( 2002) Greek Literature and the Roman Empire uses up-to-date literary and cultural theory to explore the phenomenal rise of interest in literary writing in Greece under the Roman Empire. Greek identity cannot be properly understood without appreciating the brilliant sophistication of the writers of the period, whose texts must be considered in the historical and cultural context of the battles for identity that raged under the vast, multicultural Roman Empire. \"An important contribution to the study of the so-called 'Second Sophistic' period.... Whitmarsh offers illuminating and provocative readings of texts both familiar and less known.\"--Choice  Local Knowledge and Microidentities in the Imperial Greek World by Whitmarsh, Tim ( 2010) \"The nine chapters, whose authors represent an all-star cast of thinkers about this period, are all innovative and well-written.\" Bryn Mawr Classical Review  (textbook) Mass and Elite in Democratic Athens: Rhetoric, Ideology, and the Power of the People Ober, Josiah ( 1989) Examines the political dynamics between different classes in democratic Athens, with an emphasis on the role of persuasive speaking in the assembly and the court system.  The Athenian Democracy in the Age of Demosthenes: Structure, Principles, and Ideology by Hansen, Mogens Herman ( 1991) A comprehensive account of the workings of Athenian democracy and of Athenian political ideology.  \uff33\uff30\uff21\uff32\uff34\uff21 900s\u2013192 BC[5]  (textbook) Sparta and Lakonia: A Regional History 1300-362 BC by Paul Cartledge (1979). While dated in many ways, this remains one of the pillars of scholarship on Sparta, and one of the works responsible for reviving the subject in the modern academy (textbook) Spartans: A New History Nigel M. Kennell (2010) An accessible new introduction to Sparta, taking into account the latest scholarship transforming our view on the subject. Sparta by Whitby, Michael ( 2001) An up-to-date collection of studies on aspects of Spartan history and society, most of them by the world's top historians of Sparta.  (textbook) A Companion to Sparta Anton Powell (2017) A collection of summaries of the very latest research on Sparta, written by the foremost scholars in the field.  The Ancient Greeks at War Louis Rawlings (2007 Perhaps the finest recent introduction to the topic; up-to-date and comprehensive. \"This is a fine book, which strikes a judicious balance between accessibility and scholarship, covering a much wider range of topics than most books on warfare, and offers an intelligent and original interpretation of its subject.\" --Hans van Wees, University College London Classical Greek Tactics: A Cultural History Roel Konijnendijk (2017) A comprehensive reassessment of how and why Greeks fought pitched battles. The Peloponnesian War by Kagan, Donald ( 2003) Written by one of the top experts on the war, this intelligent account is a condensed version of his four-volume history first published in the 1960s.   The Rise and Fall of Classical Greece Josiah Ober (2015)An attempt to explain the spectacular wealth and impressive achievements of Classical Greece through models from economic theory and game theory  The Ecology Of The Ancient Greek World by Sallares, Robert ( 1991)A tremendously important (though not always well-written) study of the relationship between the environment, the realities of agrarian economy, and human society.  The Invention of Coinage and the Monetization of Ancient Greece by Schaps, David ( 2003)A useful and sane study of the development of currency and its role in Greek society.  A Companion to Ancient Greek Government Hans Beck (2013)A collection of chapters on all aspects of Ancient Greek government - its different forms, institutions, practices, and values.  Courtesans and Fishcakes: The Consuming Passions of Classical Athens James Davidson (1997)An exploration of the theme of desire and the Greek obsession with controlling it; a survey of all the things and people the Greeks desired.  753 BC\u2013476 AD[6]  Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History by Mackay, Christopher S. ( 2005) A survey primarily covering political and military history. It provides a solid understanding of events, their significance and implications on the Roman state. It covers both Empire and Republic very efficiently.  Ancient Rome: From the Early Republic to the Death of Augustus by Dillon, Matthew ( 2015) A source book covering political developments, social phenomena, Roman religion, slavery/freedmen, women and their roles, and how Rome operated and evolved. The sources range from popular historians (Livy/Plutarch/Polybius) to inscriptions, laws and decrees, epitaphs, graffiti, speeches, poetry, etc. It is an essential source book for this period of time and is of unparalleled quality.  Mediterranean Anarchy, Interstate War, and the Rise of Rome by Eckstein, Arthur M. ( 2007) This book brought up an idea of why Rome came to be the preeminent Mediterranean power that hadn't really been explored extensively yet. Eckstein chose to explain it in modern Realist terms of political relations and alliances, rather than the raw brutality and tendencies towards violence which characterized the period - something he argues was not unique to Rome at all, nor were they \"better\" at it than anyone, as was the prevailing theory.
