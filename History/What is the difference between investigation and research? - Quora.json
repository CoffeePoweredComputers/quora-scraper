            "answer_text": "Research is scholarly inquiry, often it is done primarily by research scientists or their research assistants, often using one or more specialized tool(s). When meeting someone addressed by someone else as \u201cDoctor So-and-so,\u201d their answer to the question, \u201cAre you researcher or a physician?\u201d can tell you whether they are a Ph.D. (researcher) or an M.D. (physician) \u201cdoctor.\u201d (Only MDs are allowed to prescribe medicines.) Investigation is a type of research, often brought about by some unwanted situation (e.g., why a bridge failed under load, or a sudden, unexplained death). Due to the complexity and significance of many investigations, they are typically done by trained, experienced professional investigators or detectives. In China this type of activity may be combined in the work of law enforcement-and-justice officials called magistrates. Investigation generally implies official/thorough examination of facts, possible causes, and results. It is possible to do research into the possible cause(s) of death in connection with a sweeping high-profile murder investigation. So you can see that research is a more routine activity than an investigation. Scientific research generally produces some type of reasoned conclusion(s). Often, the results of murder investigations are inconclusive. Investigations are expected to produce reports of how things happen(ed), or how some scientific methods can be applied to learn the best possible explanation(s) for happenings, or how to deal with the cause(s) or those who made things happen. \u201cWe will do a thorough, full investigation.\u201d (This type of statement is often used to placate members of the press who inquire about a murder\u2014or other loss of life by possibly accidental or other yet unexplained cause(s).So when a police detective or spokesperson says that the present activity is \u201cjust a routine investigation\u201d this may be intended to mislead the audience\u2014because while much research or logging of data points may indeed be rather routine, all official investigations need to be conducted with emphasis on thoroughness and precision (to effectively learn how best to deal with the related concerns). A related word is inquiry (note that it has British and American pronunciation variants). Inquiry simply means the process of examining facts (or, more broadly, actors and situations). Here\u2019s another \u2018related\u2019 valid question: Is your research on his Facebook timeline part of the Jones murder investigation?",

            "answer_text": "is that investigate is to inquire into or study in order to ascertain facts or information while research is to search or examine with continued care; to seek diligently. An investigation can be either a \"formal inquiry\" or a \"systematic study\" by definition. The research is only the latter, a \"systematic study\". Therefore, investigation is a more general term, and research is more specific. Research seeks to generate new knowledge and test a hypothesis or support a thesis.   ",
