            "answer_text": " The divide was only possible due to gap between hindu- muslim relations which according to Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar could not be possible . I would briefly describe enormous mischief done by slogans and nostrums which Gandhi ji prescribed and followed , in pursuance of his policy , the fatal result we now know. Tearing india casually into Secular INDIA , Islamic PAKISTAN and later Islamic BANGLADESH . Still Gazwa-e-hind is hindered in India ( How cruel ? ). Here in this summary whenever riots had happened they were only happened in region of muslim majority and hindu minority . But if one community tries to outrage other by destroying their culture, raping women , killing children , forcible conversion then it is obvious for others to resist . Here are some - :  KHILAFAT - By 1914 Turkey's empire comprised of narrow strip of land . Sultan of Turkey became weak and young Turks forced Sultan to abdicate and thus Khilafat was downtrodden. India. Muslim believed it was Britishers who were responsible and thus khilafat movement was started. Mahatma miscalculated and misjudged the muslim's acceptance of congress support as a sign of merging with Congress. The movement was suppressed by combined efforts of Montague Chelmsford reforms and Britishers repression methods. Now desperate muslims lost their mind and started innumerable riots and targeting Hindus and victimized them. Thus Hindu muslim unity of Mahatma became a mirage. MOPLAH REBELLION - Malabar , Punjab, Bengal and North West Frontier province witnessed measurable scale cleansing of Hindus culture and raping women. Mahatma who brought this kept mum and later started relief funding for the moplahs instead of its victims. He even went further by declaring that their was just one case of forcible conversion in his paper 'Young India' in Malabar. He never corrected himself inspite being informed about correct numbers of hundreds by his muslim friend. Thus promised land of hindu muslim unity was not yet in sight. AFGHAN AMIR INTRIGUE - During the last breathe of khilafat movement Ali brothers tried to revive it under name of Islam. Slogans that whoever is against khilafat is against Islam were raised. Thus muslim got bounded by their solemn duty to support khilafat. Now amidst this, Ali brothers secretly invited Amir of Afghan to invade India. Mahatma inspite of knowing this extended his full support directly and indirectly. Late Mr. Shastri, Mr. C.Y. Chintamani editor of 'Leader' of Allahabad , Late Mr C.F. Andrew lifelong friend of Mahtama told him that his speeches and writings amount to support Amir's invasion. ATTACK ON ARYA SAMAJ - Gandhiji clearly showed his love for muslims by most unworthy and unprovoked attack on Arya samaj in 1924. He publicly denounced Arya samaj as to please Mohammedans was heart's desire of Mahatma. Mahtama growing influence in politics weakened Arya samaj and thus no follower of Swami Dayanand can become member in Gandhian congress. However some strong nationalist like late Lala Lajpat Rai and Swami Shradhanand were two staunch men who got hold of congress. As a result satyarth prakash was banned by government of Sindh. The two supported Gandhiji but were opposed to pro muslim policy of Gandhi ji and fought openly on this issue.Gandhiji's attack on samaj had not improved his popularity among Muslims but definitely provoked a muslim youth to murder Swami Shradhanand ji . Blames were thrown over Samaj's reactionary body but they could do nothing as everyone knew that samaj for hundreds years stood for abolition of untouchability long before Mahatma's birth. Popularised widow remarriage, denounced caste system and preached oneness not merely with hindus but whoever followed it's tenets. Swami Dayanand Saraswati founder of Arya samaj had no fus over violence and non violence. But his death and followed by demise of other political leaders , Gandhiji became all star by himself.SEPARATION OF SINDH - By 1928 jinnah established himself when Mahatma conceded his unjust and improper demands at expense of India democracy , nation and Hindus. He even supported the separation of Sindh from Bombay presidency and threw hindus to communal wolves. Numerous riots took place in Sindh- karachi, Sukkur , Shikarpur and other places Hindus were only sufferers . Thus Hindu muslim unity further receded from the horizon.LEAGUE's GOODBYE TO CONGRESS - With each defeat Gandhi ji became more desperate of achieving Hindu Muslim unity. He now increased his stakes and advocated for irrational concessions only to bring Mr. Jinnah and his enlist to support him. Muslims distance from mainstream national party increased and came to halt when in 1929 lahore session congress found muslim aloof from the resolution of independence. Now the hope of hindu muslim unity was hardly entertained by anybody but Gandhiji's desperation continued and he bent more and more for muslims to hop on.ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE AND COMMUNAL AWARD - After 1929 lahore session British understood the need for constitutional reforms . Round table conference held was for the same purpose under British PM McDonald. Congress party boycotted this conference and started a salt campaign for attainment of Poorna Swaraj. However congress regretted it boycott of first round table conference and decided to send Gandhi ji as representative of congress for second one . During second round table conference not even one decision was in support of democracy or nationalism. The Mahatma went step forward inviting Ramsay McDonald for giving communal award. Thus Mahatma was responsible for direct and substantial intrusion of communal electorate. However there is no wonder that when communal award presented Gandhiji did not protested and members were advised to 'Neither to support nor to reject it '. Those elected on communal franchise will have communal mind and would do nothing to bridge communalism and Nationalism. Thus two poles were developed and riots now began , Hindus became victims at hands of muslims . People became cynical of hindu muslim unity but Gandhiji's desperation did not tire out.( Reference : Pandit madan Mohan Malviya's speech against acceptance of communal award) ACCEPTANCE OF OFFICES AND RESIGNING IN HUFF - Provincial Autonomy was introduced in Government of India act of 1935. Congress first rejected the office but with the fear of being negated out of the national movement took office in July 1937. But a serious blunder was done that is exclusion of members of Muslim league as members of cabinet. Only muslims who were congressmen were admitted in cabinet. It would be correct elsewhere but in communal franchise and other tenets of separatism it was not feasible. Now not taking league members in its cabinet congress itself was labelled communalist . On other hand muslim were in no want of congress support , they already got needed sympathy from governors. In 1939 when congress resigned league took the opportunity, while congress seats fell vacant Muslim league members continued to hold their office. Thus communalism rose to its peak with muslim ministry on one hand and pro muslim governors on other hand. Hindu muslim unity became a dream but Gandhiji still hallucinated about leader of Hindus and Muslims.LEAGUE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF WAR - League passed a resolution to help British in war if changes is constitution of India could only be made with their full consent. Thus they got a political veto over political progress of the country. This assurance was given by Linlithgow in August 1940. Thus league did not created any nuisance for Britishers during war on other hand congress took it as opportunity to weaken British. Thus divide was further strengthen.CRIPPS PARTITION PROPOSAL ACCEPTED - Congress was in clear doubt of its stand . The war carried out till 1942. Every aid government needed was provided. In 1942 Cripps mission was presented , naturally mission failed . In 1942 All india congress committee held in Allahabad the principle of partition was rejected with overwhelming majority. But maulana Azad being the president of congress. Nullified the Allahbad session resolution and the situation back to where it started . British were effectively controlling provinces through muslim ministry and pro muslim governors .QUIT INDIA BY CONGRESS AND DIVIDE AND QUIT BY LEAGUE :Desperation of Gandhiji was at its peak and he evolved quit India movement. He slogan ' do or die ' was seen as a national rebellion. The government was quick and suppressive , a horde of leaders were imprisoned. Whole movement collapsed . Only heart melting cry of congress leaders to release the arrested leaders without formally withdrawing quit India movement. Gandhiji even staged a fast for his release but for two years until Germans were beaten he remained in jail. Mr Jinnah openly opposed 'Quit india ' as hostile to muslim and raised counter slogan ' Divide and Quit ' . That is where Mahatma's Hindu muslim unity had arrived.HINDI VERSUS HINDUSTAANI : This is the most absurd policy of Gandhiji. Hindi was most prior to be chosen as national language. Even Gandhiji himself gave great Impetus to Hindi language but in later years he came to knowledge that his muslims friends did not liked it . He at once became a turncoat and gave a new language known as Hindustani. Every one knows that there is no such language it is a bastard tongue and cross breed between Hindi and Urdu. In his desperation to appease muslims he insisted that hindustaani alone should be used as national language. His blind supporters began using words like \" Baadshah Ram\" and \" Begum Sita\" . But no-one not even he himself dared to speak Jinnah as Shri Jinnah and Maulana Azad as Pandit Azad. His one way traffic in search for Hindu muslim traffic took him nowhere. Hindustaani is actually urdu but Gandhiji could not advocate for urdu language therefore he tried to smuggle urdu under garb of Hindustaani.VANDE MATRAM NOT TO BE SUNG - Mahatma's insensible craving for support of muslim leaders was without regard of right or wrong , truth and justice. Some muslim disliked celebrated song of vande matram and thus Gandhiji stopped it's singing or recital wherever he could. In anti partition movement of Bengal in 1905 , people sang same song with great devotion for nation. Thus Gandhiji persuaded congress not to insist upon singing of vande matram . Thus now 'Jan gan man ' is our national anthem. The right should have been to enlighten the ignorant and remove the prejudice but Gandhiji's unrivalled rule of thirty years paved the way he wanted. Thus Hindu muslim unity became a one way road.SHIVA BAVANI BANNED - Gandhiji banned public recital of Shiva Bavani a beautiful collection of 52 verses by Hindu poet. This poem was on great ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The refrain of that collection says , \" If there were no shivaji , the entire country would have been converted to Islam \". Ending verses of poem - SUHRAWARDY PATRONISED - Two weeks before Pandit Nehru was to take office open massacre of Hindus broke out in Calcutta. Goverment took no steps to stop the massacre and Mr Suhrawardy's Government was not taken down. Gandhiji contracted a strange friendship with Suhrawardy . The massacre continued for three days , everything cruel , unjust happened under the nose of Guardians of law but no action was taken. Author of this massacre , Suhrawardy , was publicly described as martyr by Gandhiji. No wonder just after two months more violent outbreak started in Noakhali and Tipperah , 30,000 women were converted forcibly according to Arya samaj report. Number of killed wounded was 3 lacs. Suhrawardy gave Gandhiji protection wherever he went but owi g to all this Gandhiji never had courage to go to Noakhali district. All this massacre and atrocities by Suhrawardy were worthy enough for Gandhiji to label him as martyr.ATTITUDE TOWARDS HINDUS AND MUSLIM PRINCES - Gandhiji's followers successfully humiliated Jaipur , Bhavnagar and Rajkot states princes. They supported even a rebellion in Kashmir state against hindu prince . Muslim league not allowed Maharaj of gwalior to celebrate second millennium of Vikram Calendar. Thus in Hindu muslim clashes over this , muslims suffered some losses and Gandhiji came down on Maharaja.GANDHIJI ON FAST TO CAPACITY - In 1942 when Gandhiji was on fast to capacity and nobody was allowed to interview him. Only nearest and dearest were allowed to hop in. Mr C. Rajagopalachari smuggled himself in and hatched a plot of conceding Pakistan. Gandhiji discussed with Jinnah in later part of 1944 and offered Jinnah what we now know as Pakistan. Hindu muslim unity was making progress in negative direction.DESAI LIAQUAT AGREEMENT - In 1945 all major leaders were in jail or detained , then the Bhulabhai Desai signed an agreement with Liaquat Ali Khan to approach the conference. The agreement was that equal representation to muslims with Congress at said conference. The proposal however was made with previous knowledge and consent of Mahatma Gandhi. With this agreement of congress party , 20% were treated as 50 % and 80 % were brought down to 50%. The fact that Quit India had failed , congress had no alternative programme and events were moving on whether Congress party was ready or not. Jinnah was only gainer of this proposal.CABINET MISSION PLAN - In 1946 cabinet mission plan arrived India. The agreement was pivot of work of mission but it was fatal. Congress was honestly for a united india but it was not outright in its conviction. It lacked firmness. Jinnah on other hand demanded a divided india but demanded it firmly. Congress adopted the resolution for pakistan but did not agree to form a government. The jinnah started direct action council of muslim league. Thus Bengal, Punjab , Bihar , Bombay and other places of India became scenes of bloodshed , rapes , abduction , conversion and majority were hindus victims. Thus Mahatma goal was far away from unity.CONGRESS SURRENDERS TO JINNAH - By the following year congress gave up to muslim league and state of Pakistan was formed . Gandhiji did not uttered not even single word for lakhs of displaced hindus , his humanity was only for muslims . He always wanted india to respect all but could not muster up the courage to give same advice to jinnah for his pakistan.AMBIGUOUS STATEMENT ABOUT PAKISTAN - Gandhiji reluctantly opposed pakistan , he openly declared that if muslims want pakistan no one could stop them . Only Mahtama could understand what he declared.ILL ADVICE TO KASHMIR MAHARAJA - About Kashmir , Gandhiji again and again declared that Sheikh Abdullah should be entrusted the charge of state and that Maharaj of Kashmir should retire to Benaras for no reason other than muslim formed bulk of Kashmir population. However he did not applied this logic to Hyderabad where state was hindu Majority and ruler was muslim. Gandhiji never called upon Nizam to retire to Mecca.MOUNTBATTEN VIVISECTS INDIA - 50 % representation of muslim in congress made working of congress almost impossible. Riots, attacks , forcible conversion and rapes of Hindus could not be stopped. The more they became disloyal and treacherous , the more Gandhiji infatuation with them increased. Lord wavell who could not such cruelty on hindus had resigned and Mountbatten took the charge. Mountbatten was a military men and he was more indifferent to human slaughter. Perhaps he thought that by slaughter of Hindus or muslim only one would survive and his road would be cleared. Thus with background atrocities on hindus congress boasted it's principles and surrendered to Jinnah. This is what Gandhiji's 30 years boot licking of fanatics had caused. This is what congress called freedom or more precisely peaceful partition. I wonder if this was peaceful then what term should be used for violent ones. GANDHI ON COW SLAUGHTER- Gandhiji desire for protection of cows is very well known . But he did no effort in such direction. REMOVAL OF TRI COLOUR FLAG - Tri colour Flag with charkha was adopted by congress as National flag out of respect for Gandhiji. Prabhat pheris was never complete without flag unfurled. If hindu showed any allegiance to Bhagwa flag he was labelled communal. Gandhiji tricolour never saved Hindu woman from outrage , never protected hindu temples from desecration but still once Bhai Parmanand was mobbed by congress men for not paying homage to the flag. When Mahatma Gandhi was touring Noakhali and Tipper in 1946 , after the outrages over hindus , tri colour flag was flying on his temporary hut. But when muslim came to object he quickly directed it's removal. However , appeasement congress and Gandhiji carried out to bring muslim fanatic under his brood but great catholic Mahatma never got nearer to so called - hindu muslim unity.Source : Rex vs Nathuram godse and others Nathuram Godse\u2019s court statement in Gandhi Murder Case: Rex vs Nathuram Vinayak Godse and others Gandhiji\u2019s Politics X-rayed section 2 -> Book : Why I Assassinated Gandhi by Nathuram Godse ",

After launching the Quit India movement in 1942, which the Muslim League refused to join and then became increasingly popular, Partition probably became inevitable. These were exceptionally difficult and uncertain times, no one saw the future clearly - any more than we can today. It is pointless to judge any of those involved harshly. ",
