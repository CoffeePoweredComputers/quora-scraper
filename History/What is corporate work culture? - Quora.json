            "answer_text": "We have all heard the stories of a CEO or leader calling out that their work culture needs to be better; such as needing to be more open, or collaborative or innovative or whatever the current problem du jour happens to be; and then go ahead with some plan, initiative or effort that moves forward by ignortingt the initial call for culture change. I suspect that these leaders don\u2019t really understand the components of how work culture is created, changed, or sustained. I\u2019d argue further that each company work culture is working just fine for them, as evidenced by sustaining itself and resisting change. Perhaps the only time leaders \u2018wake up\u2019 so-to-speak is when they realize their work culture is actually resisting a necessary change that they need. Then they are often clueless on how to shift and modify their work culture. So the option left is to simply do more of the same; thinking maybe this time something will change. Sadly, I find this as the norm in most, if not all companies, that are seeking change. The irony here is that it is often the newcomer to the work culture system that sees things as they really are and as a newcomer they are in the least likely position to influence. As for the rest of us, we have simply gotten used to the way things are by making accommodations or by figuring out how to work the system. Okay, now on to the answer. The great \u2018ah-ha\u2019 I had years ago is that work culture is like the water fish swim within. The fish is probably not aware of the water unless it becomes toxic to the point that the fish cannot survive. If this analogy is accurate then it implies that everything that occurs at work is part of a system of reinforced behaviors that accumulate to norms that become part of a work culture system. If you want to know more about this check out the book on Work Culture: Your connection to lasting change at work. The book suggests that the look, feel, style, approach, whatever you want to call it, can be changed and modified, but you need to find what is holding it together. That is where you will find the greatest amount of resistance in the system, and it is the resistance to change (those things trying to keep things the same or as they are today) that needs to be addressed first in a way that opens their eyes to the possibility that there is another way of doing things in a systemic way.

            "answer_text": "Corporate work culture is driven by top-down management (like a pyramid) where a single individual makes a lot of money and the lower you go, the less you make, despite typically working the hardest. Corporate culture is maintained often times by ruthlessness, toxicity, and use of in-place mechanisms as control values specifically designed to achieve expected employee behaviors. In describing corporate work culture, companies basically use an existing template where they state their mission statement, objectives, and how they will use you (the employee) to reach and ostensibly exceed those objectives. These said objectives are really code words for revenue. The more the company makes, the more money that the CEO (and his/her cronies) makes, the more shareholders make, and the more money the board of directors individual members make. ",
