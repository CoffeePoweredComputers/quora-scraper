            "answer_text": "Sure. Many already are. However, it is not cost efficient to raise an army. It is much less expensive to bribe some key politicians to let them borrow the army of a powerful nation. Just ask any oil company or the Federal Reserve in the United States. They have been doing it for decades. In days past, railroads used the US Army to get rid of Indians who objected to train tracks being built across their hunting grounds and scaring away all the game. Go back even further than that and the large mercantile corporations used the militaries of Britain, Portugal, Spain and other European countries to protect their properties and trade routes. Sometimes it was difficult to determine where the private security force of a mercantile company ended and the military of a colonial power began. ",
