            "answer_text": "Without any doubt that would be a nuclear powered, nuclear armed submarine such as the Ohio class SSBNs. These are in essence capable of wiping out every major city of a major country. More lethal, offers faster delivery, potential anonymity and harder to counter than land based ICBMs Second would be a nuclear armed B-2 Spirit carrying standoff missiles. Something that will wreak unspeakable destruction without being detected. An ICBM launch will be detected within seconds/minutes. This will not until it releases weapons and 2 minutes before your city or assets blow up, offering an unprecedented first strike advantage. Hypersonic, nuclear or conventional warhead armed cruise missiles. Nobody has deployed these yet, except for maybe China (DF-17). The Russian Zircon and Brahmos II are still under development. Slated for 2025. I do not believe these weapons are in any deployable state yet, at least when it comes to accuracy and target discrimination. Hypersonic glide vehicles such as (Avangard) and shorter range HGVs on ballistic missiles such as DF-21D,Shaurya , Kinzhal etc. U.S had these aMaRVs in the 70s, but for some reason has obsoleted them and is now designing new ones. Maneuverable reentry vehicle - Wikipedia Third are short to mid range, hypersonic, nuclear or conventional warhead armed, short to mid range tactical ballistic missiles. Examples include: Iskander, LORA etc. can have air launched versions. Last are the old school ICBMs and regular MIRVs. Last because their launch and approach can be detected and a symmetric reply will be guaranteed. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the most powerful weapon in the world or in the history of mankind so far is a nuclear bomb called TSAR Bombs or RDS-220 ,which is a hydrogen bomb created and tested by then Soviet Union and now Russia in 30 October 1961 over Novaya zemlya island in the Russian arctic sea .  This detonation is considered to be the largest and disastrous , as the bomb is said to be 3800 times powerful than the bomb that detonated in Nagasaki in Japan during world war 2.  It had explosive capacity of 50 mega tons ,equivalent to 50 million tons of TNT. The explosion waves is said to be passed across the earth 3 times due to such a massive explosion and the pilots who dropped had felt a wave and disturbance even being few hundreds kilometres heights and away.  The dust and smoke had spread and stood 8 times the height of the Everest. It was such a mass explosion the human have ever had.
