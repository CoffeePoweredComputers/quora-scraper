            "answer_text": "It didn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t exist, so it didn\u2019t go. Let\u2019s imagine for a moment that you and I start a company. We each own 50% of the initially issued 1000 shares (out of 2,500 authorized, par value $.01, to avoid taxes) that we created as part of our incorporation. We get some investors, so we issue 1000 new shares for them, and now have 2000 shares issued. We hire a few C level types, and reverse-vest another 200 newly issued shares for them. A VC wants to invest, so we authorize more shares, do a 2000:1 split (because the VCs insist on setting up an employee option pool, but they want to make sure that the options are worthless, and they don\u2019t mind that it\u2019ll cost us unnecessary taxes every year), authorize another 5 million shares (total 10 million) and issue 2.5 million shares to the VCs in exchange for $10 million. So now we have a round at $4/share, so the company is worth $20 million on paper. Fast forward: We grow and grow and grow, and make an initial public offering at $100/share. There are about 8 million shares issued by this point (including shares issued by the company for the IPO itself to raise cash for the company), and so the company is \u201cworth\u201d $800 million. The total amount of money put into the company is still only $10 million, so where did \u201cthe money\u201d ($790 million) come from? The answer is: It didn\u2019t. It\u2019s simply the \u201clast share sold price\u201d times the number of shares outstanding minus the money invested. Now the great market bubble of 2020 comes along and the company\u2019s share price rises to $200. The company is now \u201cworth\u201d $1.6 billion, but only a total of 1 million shares have been sold thus by the VCs, the founders, and the employees (at prices between the initial $100 and the current $200). So while somewhere in the range of $100\u2013200 million came to the sellers (VCs, founders, employees), the other $1.3+ billion of \u201cmoney\u201d still does not exist in reality. It\u2019s still just \u201cmoney on paper\u201d. Now the great market panic of 2021 comes along and the company\u2019s share price drops from $200 down to $2. The company is now worth $16 million. Where did the other $1.584 billion go? The answer is (for the most part): It didn\u2019t. Many years of buying and selling later, the founders, VCs, and early employees have completely cashed out at share prices from the low of $2 to the high of $200. So not a single share remains in the original hands. Now when the share price rises and falls, it does so differently (in terms of net value) for each share, because each share was potentially bought at a different price. So each share-holder likely has either unrealized gains (the amount that their shares have appreciated in market value since buying them) or unrealized losses (the amount that their shares have depreciated in market value since buying them). However, only when those shares are actually bought by someone else will we know what the real amount (i.e. \u201crealized gain or loss\u201d) will be.

            "answer_text": "Yes, in fact, on average, the stock market crashes about once every decade. There was a crash in 1937, Dow down 50%. The 1970s was a period of ten years where the Dow entered at one price and closed out the decade at, within a few dollars, the exact same price; during that interim period were years where the Dow was up 25% and periods where it was down 25%. Nonetheless, it was a totally lost decade. 1987, in one day, the Dow lost 21% of its value; it took years to again reach pre-crash highs. 2000, the Dow lost 25% while the NASDAQ lost 75%. 2007, the Dow and NASDAQ both lost 50%. What separated the 1929 crash from everything following it was, or course, the depression (though the Dow did lose nearly 90% of its value), which was a combination of incredibly inept social and fiscal decisions made by the Hoover administration and Congress, notably the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act which severely stifled global trade, Hoover\u2019s raising of taxes in 1932, and the fed raised interest rates, plus the fact that the country was on the gold standard at the time of the crash which made it almost impossible to implement any type of monetary policy. Additionally, WWI pushed a lot of countries and farmers within the US to up their production, and when the war ended, overproduction caused farm prices to plummet in an era when there was no farm support; family farms fell to large farmers and the largely uneducated and unskilled flooded into the cities. When the market crashed, those folks were out of work with no place to go. Which is to say that a lot of extraordinary events came together to create the depression, most of which, individually, might not have triggered the depth of the depression, but in combination did. Today, my largest concern about \u201cthe next\u201d market crash is the fact that the debt is monumental and deficits are growing way out of control, and, with interest rates as low as they are, the fed will not have much maneuvering room to counter the effects of any economic slowdown, plus, the fed is already holding $3 trillion in debt instruments. My concern: another \u201cperfect storm brewing?\u201d ",
