            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question. For me, I believe the more I study life's purpose the more I become something of a niahlist. I then wonder if that's actually accurate. I have a moral compass. I treat people fairly, I don't have any prejudice in my heart and things actually do upset me, if someone is being mistreated or injustice is done. Personally, I believe I have struggled early on with balancing the obligation of being Christian and allowing myself the freedom of free thought and self awareness when marginalizing and compartmentalizing morality. Morality is subjective, as Woody Allen has taught us, and for me I think taking a step away from any kind of institution has allowed me to venture into very fulfilling, enlightening confrontation with possibilities when contrasting existence, purpose, love, intelligent design, perception and geogarphies imprint on our psyche. Most sane people are aware that only two real facts exsist when considering what we can actually control and that is our thoughts and our actions. Beyond this or before this or beside of this or over top of this, life is happening in one perpetual motion. Our perception of time is formatted for us to understand it in a way that fits our agendas and ultimately allows us to observe and experience it in a very abstract way, because humans have the ability to personalize things because we see ourselves in society not of society. I find myself more and more often not dismissing things, such as religion or culture and embracing it objectively with an appreciation of it's community and how a common good, or an agreed upon common good can bring people together to gage morality, kindness, sex and love, and as someone who sees life from a sociological spot in my own time while conscious, Im aware that I have lost my own space in this great experience and I struggle with not being a complete spectator because I feel if I become involved too intensely, I have the ability to disrupt the natural fluidity of the world around me and often times this leaves me very depressed, but I subject my happiness or would be happiness to observe the chaos which is this place in the now as I flow with it, not allowing myself to participate which is also an incredible injustice to myself and those who love me. Allowing nascent encroachment of facts and exploring wisdom which is truth in the dark, can be tragically yet beautifully rewarding. ",

            "answer_text": "Enlightenment is the ultimate Truth of the universe and of existence. Full enlightenment contains everything and does not discriminate between good and evil. You will realise the full scale of reality, so every dark thing in the world must be included. Every dark side that exists in the world must be fully accepted and integrated in order to understand EVERYTHING. Enlightenment is the breaking down of all boundaries and axions. There will be no difference between you and me, us and them, good and evil, bright and dark, existence and non-existence. Everything will be put into perspective and will be transcended. So in a way, yes, what you maybe consider dark at the moment is included and necessary in the ultimate truth. Every pain you can imagine is included in the ultimate truth. But consider that when you experience a state of enlightenment, you wont be able to tell the difference. Reality as a whole will be transcended. The false notion of dualism, of separating the world into some sort of categories, is the thing you are trying to get rid of in the spiritual process. Youre gonna become both light and dark and youre gonna realise, there was never a difference. And that's what's true. The only one who differentiates is ego. Amen ",
