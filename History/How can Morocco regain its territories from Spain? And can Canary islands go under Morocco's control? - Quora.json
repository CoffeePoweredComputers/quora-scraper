I\u2019m Dutch and I traveled to Spain, Morocco and Gibraltar and I\u2019m afraid that i don\u2019t agree with those answers. Answering Sergio Marrero Ponce, Nato might not be happy of the situation, but then Nato article 5 won\u2019t be accurate in this situation since there will be a contradiction \u201c the same way that Spain is part of Nato, Morocco is the biggest ally of the U.S outside Nato (with almost the same privileges, and the U.S will be obliged to defend Morocco as well\u201d. Convincing the local population won\u2019t work in a \u201csemi-non-democratic country as spain\u201d just look to what\u2019s happening in Catalonia as Madrid keeps violating basic human rights and criminalizing Catalan \u2018democratically elected leaders\u2019. Also, we must not forget that Morocco is economically more stable than Spain when we look to the official figures \u201cPublic debt =99% of the total Spanish GDP\u201d against 64.4% for the Moroccan GDP. Plus the unemployment rate in Spain of \u201c16%\u201d against only \u201c9.3%\u201d in Morocco that clearly shows that the living in Morroco is already far better than living in Spain, where Spain most income is North European countries donations, and their populations retirement money. Spain is diplomatically blackmailing the U.K about Gibraltar through the Brexit, other countries (like mine \u201cThe Netherlands\u201d) are already considering the Nexit, this is of course due to the poor European countries like Spain, Greece \u2026 . Spain knows that the economies of both Ceuta and Mellilia are based on the informal trade at those cities borders by the Moroccans, meaning, that Morocco doesn\u2019t even need to march this time to get those cities back but simply to stop the informal trade and the local population will be automatically be forced out from those cities. To conclude, Morocco is already capable of regaining those cities, but this north African country is not ready to risk it advanced status and partnership with the European Union over few km\u00b2 of land.

            "answer_text": "For the sake of argument, setting aside someone cannot regain something that was never theirs: Simply conquering or invading is out of the question. Killing or displacing the population won't work. NATO allies would not be happy.    The first step would be to convince the local population they are better off* being a part of Morroco than a part of Spain. This has worked out for Britain and Gibraltar. Morroco being part of the EU would help. To sum it up, first, make Morroco a far better place than Spain to live in. Someway get the population to want to be Morrocan rather than Spanish. Marching in won't work this time. This is practically imposible in the short run at least. Locals are Spanish and even muslim locals of Morrocan origin probably prefer being Spanish, or both Spanish and Morrocan.  Now, imagine this is achieved. You now have many (still) Spanish, citizens that want to be Morrocan instead and want the territory they live in to be free of Spanish rule because it's much better to be Morrocan. You have to make the rest of Spain want to give it up. Sounds a bit like Catalonia and highly unlikely to succeed. To sum it up: Make living in Morroco far better than living in Spain, and make Spain not want to hold on to that territory. This is something Morroco, today, is uncapable of.  And I would like to remind once again, you cannot \"re\"gain something you never had in the first place. * Better off: Simply means they would be happier. Would not care for cultural and historical ties, keeping their language and of course have better living standards. ",
