            "answer_text": "It would not be any different. Today children will die of starvation and war. Wars lead and perpetrated by both Islam & Christian Governments. Example: It is the U.K, a predominately Christian country who supply Saudi Arabia with missiles which are used to kill children. Example: Iran and Saudi Arabia both kill innocent civilians in Yemen. Both of the Islam Faith. The invasion of Iraq condemned in the Chilcot Inquiry was lead by Christian Governments. Islam is not a reason for somebody to want to die in a hail of bullets as they randomly and brutally kill innocent civilians. Those who brutally kill in terror attacks have read the ideology that ISIS and Al Qaeda have written as a Philosophy and applied it to the word of God. Those are not the words of the Prophet Muhammad. But there are many of Islam whose journey to Heaven is a road that rejects completely the immorality of the West. That is their choice . Is it any different from the Catholic Nuns who shield themselves from a decadent world? We of the West must learn to accept their chosen path. We must learn to live with their choice and ensure they are able to give voice to their place in the world. Then we will begin to offer an alternative to those whose absolute frustration with the West has turned to hate and isolation. There is no other way to stop the terrorists. You cannot kill them all. It could have been the Bible - the chosen word of the IRA and other groups who seek to add conviction to their belief. When 95% of Muslims pick-up the Quran they are not driven to a suicide bombing they are provided with a methodology for their chosen way of a Peaceful life. We and our extremely inward looking Governments urgently need to understand that we cannot use our own Christian morality to justify our actions, when we are taking sides in the Middle East and killing innocent civilians. Everyday in Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Africa innocent people continue to die because the West will not act as a legal united force. Nobody forces a radical at gun-point to become a suicide bomber. Nobody fills him or her full of drugs and points him to a crowded populated area. Nobody pays him vasts sums of money and provides him with a new post-bombing identity. Nobody kidnaps his wife and children and says they will die unless he kills innocent people.. Therefore the only way that a suicide terrorist can be provided with an alternative to his chosen path of martyrdom, is to allow him to see that he can be more use to God by using himself to bring Peace, not prolong war. We must counter the radical ideology of ISIS and Al Qaeda. But not as an ordered script , as a true belief a new Philosophy that explains God and allows an alternative to a system of democracy and representation that has failed the poor and those in conflicts. For that we also need a new Military Strategy and a support of the Middle East and Africa that is without corruption and with democracy. Ask your Governments why they have rejected mine. Let us hope that the rejection does not add to the words of Al Qaeda and ISIS. Our Peace will come from the word of God, that of Jesus and the Prophet Muhammad. www.showempathy.one  ",

            "answer_text": "The Arab tribes would not have united.The Sassanid and Byzantine empires would not have been overrun. Both would have continued plugging away at each other for a few hundred years. The people of the northern Middle East and North Africa would not have been converted away from Christianity to another religion. The various forms of Iranian religion would have survived and possibly been strengthened, with Mazdaism, Mithraism, Mandaeism, Manicheism, Yazdanism all viable faith forms from Mesopotamia eastwards.Baghdad would not have been founded.The Arian Germano-Roman regimes of Iberia and north-west Africa would have remained. Altho it\u2019s likely the Germanic languages (Visigothic, Suevic, Vandalic) would have died out as they did in OTL, the Romance languages would probably have survived, and what we call the \u2018Maghreb\u2019 would have been part of the Romance-speaking world. Maltese would probably be Romance. There might have developed a \u2018Berber-Romance\u2019 with a \u2018Amazigo\u2019 language written in a \u2018Tifinago\u2019 script.Christianity would have penetrated down into Africa, instead of Islam. There would have been no Delhi Sultanate, Ghaznavids, Mughals, or Islamisation of the Maldives or Indonesia. Of course there may have been other Afghan or Central Asian invasions of India.A fuller Byzantine empire might have better resisted the incoming Turkic peoples from Central Asia centuries later. They might have been stopped by the Persians even before then. Either of these two empires, assuming they still existed, might have put up a better fight against the Mongols (again, assuming the Mongol empire happened, since this is dependent on Genghis Khan).The Byzantine empire would have been stronger against Western Europe and Latin Christianity. As the Vatican assumed greater and greater pre-eminence the four Patriarchs in the Byzantine world (three of whom were overrun by Muslim rule in OTL) might have united against it and presented a more reasonable and consensual model of Christianity which might have been more attractive in eastern Europe and North Africa. Orthodox Christianity might have extended up to Czechia and Tunisia. Altho Justinian lost his throw of the dice in attempting to reconquer Italy in the 530s and \u201840s some of Western Europe might have come under Byzantine sway, perhaps as vassal states.Iconoclasm might not have happened, as it may have been inspired by Islamic aniconism (opinion varies). Egyptian, Levantine and Anatolian Greek would have survived, along with Aramaic. The crusades would not have happened, and there would have been no Knights Templar for Dan Brown to write books about. The Italian trade with Constantinople would not have come to an end with a conquest by such as the Ottomans. There would have been friendlier trade across the Mediterranean with the fellow Romance-speaking Christian North Africans, and probably no Mediterranean slave trade and piracy. We might still know how to make Greek fire.Much has been made of the Translation Movement and the House of Wisdom. But just because the Islamic Golden Age wasn\u2019t there doesn\u2019t mean Greek learning would be lost. It was lost mostly in Western Europe, but maybe it would have survived in the Byzantine and Sassanid worlds anyway. The question is would it then have been re-transmitted to Western Europe, in the later Middle Ages. Maybe yes, maybe no, but maybe it doesn\u2019t really matter, because maybe some other part of the world would have become dominant rather than Western Europe and taken that preserved ancient Greek learning and built on it in the same way Western Europe did in OTL.It\u2019s quite possible that tho Mohammed\u2019s religious revolution didn\u2019t happen, a different one did, somewhere, some other time, perhaps Russia or Afghanistan or the Sahara, and there would be a new force uniting people and conquering lands and forming empires and influencing other religions. If it happened somewhere like Iran it could have molded Zoroastrian, Hindu, Buddhist and Christian beliefs into one new faith that incorporated elements of all. This could have been a powerful force that expanded in all directions, and a resurgent Sassanid or post-Sassanid Persia with this religion and the inheritance of Greek and Indian learning might have been motivated to start exploring beyond the known world, eventually crossing oceans and connecting the world in the way that Western Europe did in OTL.The Arabs may eventually have been converted to Christianity or another religion. The peoples of North Africa and northern Middle East would not speak Arabic or consider themselves \u2018Arab\u2019. Mecca would not be considered a holy city and could be visited by people of any religion, altho most would not want to as it would just be a backwater and tourists would be much more attracted to the huge shrines and temples in Khorasan/Meroe/Kiev/Chechnya.",

On the other side, the Crusades would not have happenned. Islamic culture is very important to our own culture. Algorithm, algebrics, algarisms, astronomy, medicine, and a lot of beautiful histories, all involving djins, vizirs, princes, and Bagdad, nights in the desert, heroism, dangers, slaves, sailors, camels\u2026 Sorry, I got caught in a daydream trip. I think the arab culture, and the muslim religion and philosophy, enriched us in ways we cannot weight. We have a debt of gratitude to them, but we cannot ignore what happened there, what they became, and our responsability in that. I think that if Islam and Mohammed never happened, our world today could be worse in some aspects. Who knows? ",
