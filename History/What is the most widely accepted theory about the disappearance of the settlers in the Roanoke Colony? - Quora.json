            "answer_text": "Jeffrey Larson\u2019s answer is a good summary of the responsible speculation on the fate of the colonists. There has been a positive DNA match between people now living in the USA and British ancestors who were probably among the colonists, lending some credence to the notion that the early settlers were absorbed by native American tribes to the west and north of Roanoke. Here is an informative video:  It can also be helpful to consider the historical and economic forces in play at the time. The settlers went to the New World under a charter granted to Sir Walter Raleigh by Queen Elizabeth I. The deal was that he could claim the land, provided he could establish a permanent settlement. Raleigh and his investors were interested in resources -gold, especially- which they thought may be had in abundance. At the same time, England was prepping for a war with Spain, and this involved mandatory raids on Spanish ships, to relieve them of whatever treasure they might have and otherwise to challenge Spain\u2019s well established presence in the Caribbean, and along the east coast of North America. This ultimately climaxed in the famed and failed raid by the Spanish Armada against England, engaged by Drake, but ultimately destroyed by storms. Add to that the sometimes violent weather along the North Carolina coast (where dozens of ship wrecks may be found to this day) and you have a very dicey situation in terms of survival. And on top of all that, the area around Roanoke was in the middle of a serious drought. It is absolutely known that the colonists desperately needed more food and supplies from England, and a ship was dispatched back to the homeland. But provisioning was delayed by the war at sea with Spain. Thus the colonists, who were suffering, were cut off for four years from any relief, and a struggle for mere survival was at hand. It is reasonable to assume that the settlers had every reason to move off their island, and seek refuge, food, water and shelter inland. That is the most likely scenario, and the presence of their crockery and other items far from Roanoke, plus the emerging DNA studies, support the idea. Some years ago I spoke with a National Park Service employee at Fort Raleigh National Historic site, which maintains the grounds around the \u201clost colony\u201d and features an interesting introductory film about the history. I suggested that a DNA study might be helpful, and she agreed. But at that time, the human genome had only just been mapped, and DNA tests were too expensive. But the tests are cheap, now, and the investigation continues. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no definitive answer. However, evidence at the site lends credence to the theory that the colonists relocated peaceably to what was then Croatoan and is now Hatteras Island, and lived with an Indian tribe there. According to Powhatan, the chief of the Algonquins living nearest the Jamestown colony, he conducted a massacre of those Indians and any Europeans living with them just a few years before the Jamestown colony was established, meaning that the Roanoke colonists could have lived there peacefully for about 20 years. There is also evidence that they may have divided up between several Indian tribes in the area, so that Powhatan may not have gotten them all. As late as the 1880s there were Indians claiming to be descended from the Roanoke colonists, and prior to that there were reports of \"grey-eyed Indians\" and \"Indians living in two-story houses, which they were taught how to build by the colonists\". Some archeological evidence exists, but it is not conclusive. At the time, the area was subject to severe coastline erosion, so that any buildng remains erected by the colonists are now likely underwater. There is also a DNA project that is attempting to verify descent from the settlers, but so far it has not conclusively identified any living descendant. ",
