            "answer_text": "I disagree with the other answers and I somewhat doubt things like putting butter on sliced bread and then layering more food on it was common prior to the 18th century. There\u2019s an interesting tidbit found on wikipedia which echo\u2019s other things I read. The immediate culinary precursor with a direct connection to the English sandwich was to be found in the Netherlands of the seventeenth century, where the naturalist John Ray observed that in the taverns beef hung from the rafters \"which they cut into thin slices and eat with bread and butter laying the slices upon the butter\"\u2014explanatory specifications that reveal the Dutch belegde broodje, open-faced sandwich, was as yet unfamiliar in England.  A story which ties into that is that the Dutch stadhouder Maurice travelling with the army lodged in a farm and when he had a piece of bread on which he smeared butter he reached for the cheese only to have the farmer slap his hand and tell him he could not have that too. Putting both butter and cheese used to be considered something of an excess for those less well off. \u2018Zuivel op zuivel is het werk van de duivel\u2019 was still preached in the 18th century and it resurfaced when the Dutch faced a famine during WWII. The phrase translates to \u2018Dairy on dairy is the devils work. Putting butter on a piece of bread was one thing but as the examples above allude to putting cheese or meat on buttered bread was an outrageous display of excess or a curiosity which Englishmen in the 17th century had only seen in the Dutch Republic. How come sandwiches were only invented in the 18th century (John Montagu), when it's nothing more than food between 2 slices of bread (things that had existed for centuries)? You are working with a lot of assumptions here and possible projecting the present back on the past. Did people eat their bread in slices as you suggest or did they simply tear it?Did people eat their bread plain or did they dip it in sauce or pottage?When did people start putting butter on their bread?When did people start putting additional items of food on buttered bread?When did people put food on buttered bread and then turned it into an easy to eat package by putting a second slice of buttered bread on top?You can\u2019t just assume people had buttered sliced bread with food layered on top for centuries without some evidence for that practise. In all likelihood that practise of making open faced sandwiches only started between the 15th-17th century in the Low Countries with its relatively rich citizenry and extensive dairy farming from where it spread to England in the 17th or 18th century to become the true sandwich.

            "answer_text": "It is always the last guy who invents something that gets to name it, not the first. What John Montagu popularized was the practice of eating thinly sliced cold meats, imported cheese on thin buttered pieces of pain de mie, all of those were high end goods in the late 1700\u2019s. His name got stuck on what was a fancier version of low end bar food. The low end food would have been served early in the day to workmen of the day. There is at least one diary entry from a 16th century Londoner, when chronicles were the blogs of the day and any lettered person of means was keeping one, who wrote that he had bought the bread and cheese that was being pedaled to workmen as he rode north through Smithfield. He wasn\u2019t impressed with 2 roughly cut pieces of rye bread with crumbly cheese, onions, and mustard. We know that later such things were also sold in taverns and to travellers with the first record of meat being in them (in England) from the mid 17th Century. With that said they had been eating bread rolls broken open (not sliced in two) and stuffed with various cold items for centuries. It was also not uncommon to get baked bread rolls with items stuffed in them as well. Flatbreads rolled around toppings goes back thousands of years. ",
