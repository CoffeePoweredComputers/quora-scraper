            "answer_text": "Italy would have been safe from the defeat and fascism would have lasted for decades like Franco\u2019s regime did in Spain (but Franco was wiser than Mussolini because recalled the clash of Spanish and British Empires in 16th-17th centuries which signed the irrevocable international decline of the former). Therefore the Catholic church (urged by the prevailing non-Italian Catholics around the world) would have been obliged to became more progressive and liberal decades earlier than what is starting happening today with pope Francis\u2019 attempts, so that it could have played the role of main opponent in the Italian home politics.

            "answer_text": "I think the Fascist regime would have declined anyway. By 1938, the widespread consensus it had enjoyed earlier in the decade had pretty much evaporated; the government was at daggers drawn with the Church over the anti-Jewish race laws, which the Church had condemned with no ifs or buts. The Ethiopian war had involved the country into an expensive and pretty worthless adventure, and had made it astonishingly unpopular abroad. And the sense of oppression and restriction was growing. The great poet and satirist Trilussa, who came as close as anyone to being a voice of the people in a time of tyranny, wrote some astoundingly bitter and dark poems about 1938, describing the country (allegorically) as a low, dirty den, where everyone is reduced to their own shadow, because everyone is in terror of saying anything that was not allowed; and predicting WWII and the disaster to follow. Certainly Fascism would not have survived Mussolini, whenever he died. ",
