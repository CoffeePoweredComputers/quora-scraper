            "answer_text": "The full answer is a bit complex so I won\u2019t go into a lot of detail. Also, the development of television, including video cameras, was a long process with each little step built upon previous steps. So overall it took a few decades to get to a practial point. You may know that TV - especially pre-digital - scanned lines from top to bottom. The first system to do this didn\u2019t do it all electronically. The first video camera/television system was partially mechanical and used a spinning \u201cNipkow disk\u201d with holes in it. The first Nipkow disk was patented in 1885, but the first wireless experimental television transmission was made on November 25, 1925, but there were wired transmissions made even before then. The reason I mention it more as a system rather than just a camera is because if you have a video camera and nothing to watch the images with, the camera is just an expensive paperweight. The image below is of a \u201cflying spot scanner\u201d (it\u2019s mostly lights because the system needed a lot of light), which is one of the earliest types of video cameras.
