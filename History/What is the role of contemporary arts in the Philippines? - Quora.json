            "answer_text": "The role of art is a contested one no matter where you look, but this question is particularly interesting in the case of the Philippines, considering the way it was promoted by Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos. Ferdinand Marcos, being a corrupt and authoritarian dictator who suppressed democracy and held onto power for 21 years, needed positive public relations schemes, and his wife Imelda was a big fan of contemporary art. So, he and his wife poured money into contemporary art projects as a way of showing that the Philippines were a modern and progressive society, drawing attention away from their abuses of power. On the one hand, they actually promoted some cool stuff, such as an experimental sound-art project which was aired simultaneously on all of the country\u2019s radio stations. However, it should be noted that they were happy to promote art which was experimental, but not that art which was politically sensitive or critical of their regime. Nor should we forgive them for their corruption and human rights abuses and subversion of democracy, just because they funded some art projects. This is what we now call art-washing: the practice of funding the arts in order to clean up a tarnished public image. Some recent cases of art-washing which drew a lot of attention include the massive donations of the billionaire Koch Brothers to the Metropolitan Opera and Museum in New York, which were no doubt intended to make up for their actions polluting the environment and bank rolling far right wing politics. Or, there was the case of Warren B. Kanders, who recently was successfully pressured to step down from his role as a board member at the Whitney Museum, due to the fact that he made his millions selling teargas, which is used to suppress protest movements around the globe. As for the Philippines today, I think there is probably less public funding for contemporary art now than there was under the Marcos regime; however, I would also guess that artists now have more freedom to make whatever they want, and to criticize the government without censorship. Furthermore, I would argue that this is the ideal function of contemporary art, both in the Philippines and everywhere else: to give voice to self expression, whether that overtly involves politics or not (but then again, one could argue that the personal is always political). Perhaps if someone from the Philippines with knowledge of the contemporary art scene is reading this, they may be so kind as to tell us whether or not my assumptions are on the mark. I know the current President is not the most progressively minded guy, but I suspect he probably just ignores art and laughs off any critique leveled against him, like Trump, rather than deigning to censor artists, though I\u2019m just guessing, I could be wrong.
