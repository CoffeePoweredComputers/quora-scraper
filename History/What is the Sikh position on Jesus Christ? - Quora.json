            "answer_text": "I do not see any difference in a Sikh or a hindu so i as a hindu am going to answer this question which is asked for a Sikh to answer . For us Jesus Christ is a god for people of Europe . During his life he cared or treated needy and patients . Because of his growing popularity the authorities of his land became fearful of him ( in short ) , so they crucified him to finish a growing challenging danger . Now many of his followers have came to our land also . They search targets ( convertable people ) in our society and then convinces them that Jesus is better than Indian gods . Hinduism believes in let live . Many tribes have followed their tribal gods parallel to giant Hinduism in India . Hindus didn't tried ever to convert them . North eastern India which was tribal before 2000 have majority Christian ( anti Hinduism ) population now . Followers of Jesus are creating enemies for us among us . Such acts of missionaries are making us suspicious about godism of Jesus . These acts are persuading us ( Hindu Sikhs ) to find devilish faults in Jesus . I hope it helped . ",

            "answer_text": "Being Sikhs we have respect for Jesus Christ who is regarded as son of god. He taught the path of love and devotion to acquire the blessings of god, his sacrifice to get people out of sins is seen as a divine task. Our, philosophies, way of worship and central figure may be different but being Sikhs we are taught to practice universal brotherhood and see the whole world as our extended family... Peace ",
