            "answer_text": "The short answer would be to do something of note that historians would be obligated to record. I prefer the method of tackling some sort of major world issue: hunger for example. If achieving recognition for your works is your goal, I would strongly recommend studying the lives of the great men and women who have done so in the past. Anyone who has the moniker \"the Great\" would be a good start. The television show Vikings is an excellent starting resource for an in depth study of the Lothbrok's. As you study, you are going to notice strong similarities between such historical figures. Most notably: Honour, Ambition, Diligence, , Strength, Inquisitiveness, Tenacity, Adaptability, Intellegence, Wisdom, etc. The list can (and does) go on forever. To me however, the most important common thread is non-conformity. Great thinkers (and doers) rarely waste time listening to the negative thoughts of their contemporaries. When someone says something can not be done they consider it a challenge. You advance civilization by looking at the world differently, not by doing things the way that they have always been done. Being truly great is not an easy road. People tend to fear that which they do not understand. You will have to overcome the incredible amount of resistance that society in general has toward real and meaningful change. The people who think that they have power in this world have a vested interest in the status quo. Their wealth depends on it, and they are always ready to use their wealth (and anything else at their disposal) to eliminate maverick thinkers who might upset the balance of power or educate the masses. An educated populace is far easier to control than an educated one. The fact that literacy rates are plummeting at an alarming rate is no accident. You are likely to be publicly ostracized, and painted as a dangerous (and mentally unstable) subversive. Be prepared for this. Push through. We all have to. Reason must prevail. We now live in Police States. If we don't stand up for Justice, Freedom of Thought and Expression, and common human decency, then there is a real risk that they will disappear from the world entirely; existing only in the memories of those who once experienced them. The time to stand is now. Are you going to stand for what you believe in or keep complaining about the way thing are? Choose, and stick to your decision. Better to die well than to live your life as a slave to Corporate interest and the whims of a ruling elite that cares nothing for you or your children's future. ",

            "answer_text": "I like Matthew McVeagh\u2019s reply. I can add little to it, except: Put him in the right place, and any fool can make history. Try to avoid being a fool. Instead, try do something useful for the world. 2. Try plan things out a little, first. Too much planning, and you will never get anything done. Too little, and you may well be an accidental footnote of history. 3. Look at your strengths, your weaknesses, your education, training, skills, abilities, passion. What, in short, do you have to offer?4. Being famous, one thing. Being notorious, another. Note the difference. Try for fame. Bonnie and Clyde were notorious. They did make the history books, for now. In 100 years? Who knows. 5. Being a national, or state, or provincial leader, or a military man is a good start. Also risky. Conquering the world, is passe. 6. MONEY. Earn enough, and\u2026. But that is hard. Still, if you succeed in any way, the good news, is that you may well attract some. Unless you go for the Ghandi thing. 7. Can you sing, dance, write something (plays, films, poetry, movies, essays, ghost-writing, speeches, books, articles, etc.) Can invent or perfect something? Can you entertain? Cure a disease? Build something. See becoming famous involves DOING something (likely unusual, or big, or\u2026) that ends up making you famous. But it is SO easy to become famous for the wrong reasons. Killing John Lennon? BAD idea. IF you do it\u2026. Mention Matthew and I! (Which is another way. Get someone famous to notice and mention, you!) And note that Matthew and I, should you become rich, and powerful, would like a small memento of your thanks. Perhaps the deed to a platinum mine. As in the song Santa Baby. At any rate: Good luck! Hang in there. Shoot for the stars, and you may hit the moon. And do note: Doing ONE big thing is a way. But today, with \u201cthe social media\u201d, doing many small things WELL, ah, that is another opportunity!",
