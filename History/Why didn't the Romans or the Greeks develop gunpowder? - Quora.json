            "answer_text": "The Greeks and Romans knew all the ingredients of gunpowder: sulphur, charcoal, and saltpeter, or potassium nitrate. Sulphur is a kind of rock that occurs naturally. Charcoal everyone in Afro-Eurasia made by burning wood very slowly. Saltpeter forms naturally in manure as it rots, and you could mine it in caves where bats roosted and their guano rotted. Saltpeter is mentioned by ancient Egyptians and in the Bible, so it was well known to the Greeks and Romans, who seem to have used saltpeter as a kind of cleaning product, like soap. Ge Hong seems to have developed the first gunpowder, in China about 300 AD. But nobody thought to use gunpowder for military purposes for another 600 years, so it was hardly a breakthrough invention. It took people 400 years even to start using it for fireworks shows. In the time of classical Greece, there was not yet enough wealth to support an educated class of scientists who devoted themselves to chemistry, either in Greece or in China, or in most places in between. By the time of the Roman Empire, highly educated research scientists were doing that sort of experiment all across Afro-Eurasia. In India, they invented a very high quality steel. In Syria and Egypt, scientists invented ways to make clear glass by adding chemicals to the glass, and ways to make colored glass. Roman chemists experimented and developed better types of concrete, including a waterproof concrete. So they were inventing similar kinds of things - they just didn\u2019t invent this one. And in China, where Ge Hong did invent gunpowder, he doesn\u2019t seem to have thought it was very important, anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, why should they have? It\u2019s a weird mix of ingredients. Charcoal\u2019s dead common, certainly, and sulfur isn\u2019t that rare if you\u2019re an ancient alchemist, but saltpeter is rather less common. It was known and even used in some parts of the ancient world as a component in fire-starting materials. Dried fungi were impregnated with a saltpeter solution to make them easier to set fire to. Still, it\u2019s not something that would have been around in quantity. Moreover, it can be difficult to work with. Some forms of it are hygroscopic. That is, they absorb moisture from the atmosphere naturally. That tends to make the nascent gunpowder damp. It has to be properly treated and stored to make proper gunpowder. So, then, the initial invention of gunpowder in China appears to have been a fortuitous combination of ingredients, not something which someone could have figured out before doing it by accident. ",
