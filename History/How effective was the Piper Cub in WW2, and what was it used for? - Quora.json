            "answer_text": "The Cub, as well as several other similar aircraft were used primarily as \u201cUtility\u201d aircraft, often hauling senior officers to conferences, getting somebody from point \u201cA\u201d to wherever when speed was a necessity. They were also used for light local reconnaissance and more importantly, for spotting the fall of artillery fire and calling adjustments to the firing batteries. Some also modified as air ambulances, able to carry one passenger who had absolutely no hope of getting out of the plane if it should crash, as he was usually on a bare bones stretcher inside the fuselage, aft of the cockpit. It was \u201cNo-Frills\u201d flying, all the way, but many important tasks were completed successfully by those slow little low-altitude \u201cbug crushers\u201d. In essence, they served in every theater of Operations and carried out a wide variety of tasks. Just remembered, a Civil Air Patrol Piper Cub was credited with damaging a U-Boat (with the one depth charge they were able to carry) in the Chesapeake Bay in 1942 or \u201843; preventing it from submerging and hollering for help until the Coast Guard showed-up and finished her off. As I recall the story, the pilot fired his .45 at the sub\u2019s crew, preventing them from manning their anti-aircraft weapons or attempting repairs, while his Observer screamed like mad for some assistance.
