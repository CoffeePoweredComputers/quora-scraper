            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on the meat you\u2019re asking about. Meat has always been readily available for all classes of people, it is the type of meat that is available that differs among classes. Fish is available through all classes. Currently, white-meat fishes are cheapest and other fishes (like salmon) are more expensive. Historically, however, even salmon was a \u201cpoor-man\u2019s\u201d meal. It\u2019s the rise of commercial fishing that starts to change that, overfishing and fish farming contribute as well. As for land-based meat, game animals (bird, rabbit, deer, boar to an extent) were readily available for all classes. Rabbit and bird (aside from chicken) tend to be a higher class meal now as they are smaller in meat quantity per animal and fewer people breed them for meat purposes. Deer has become simultaneously a low-class and high-class, but not middle-class food: people who rely on hunting often take deer as it has a high meat per animal compared to many game animals while also being easily found (elk, moose, etc. are generally more dangerous to hunt); as a higher class food, deer are farmed (farms are limited, thus the meat is limited). Livestock are another story - pork and chicken are very cheap meats, beef is not. It is infinitely cheaper to keep pigs and chickens than it is to keep cattle. Pigs and chickens have also historically served another purpose of aiding with compost - both eat food scraps, usually with great gusto. Cows, on the other hand, need land to graze and often supplementary feed. Meat prices vary by the year and by the type, but it can still be considered a luxury good in some cases and in others, it is only just becoming a luxury good thanks to class discrepancies and artificial inflation.
