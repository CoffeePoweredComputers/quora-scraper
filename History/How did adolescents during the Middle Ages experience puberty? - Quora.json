Parents told their children what was happening to them when changes began to happen. They may have even looked forward to growing up. Girls who reached puberty during the middle ages were considered adults. Remember puberty has changed a lot since then. The age of conscent for nobility was 7\u201312. So she would be expected to have been married before puberty. Like girls of today, she would have reached puberty between ages 10\u201318. This would be her years of motherhood. She would be expected to have her first child during this time. The man she would have married would have been about 10 years older than she. He would have to fully provide for her care. All other girls would marry after reaching puberty. They would already have been promised to a young man (ages 20\u201340) in most cases. The city girls would be married around age 16- 18. Country girls would be married around ages 21\u201333. Puberty for each class would be a different experience. Medieval Maidens ",
