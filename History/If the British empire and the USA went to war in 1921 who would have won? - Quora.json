            "answer_text": "The United States. Other answers are comparing the US-British relationship in 1921 to the Chinese-US relationship today. This is a grossly flawed comparison. While the West was industrializing, China endured its century of humiliation. It had a large population, but its people were poor and did not have access to educational institutions and resources comparable to the West. The people of China were exploited by foreign powers, and the country went from one (or more) terribly mismanaged government to the next. It was only in the 1970s that a unified and strong China began a deliberate effort to industrialize. It has made remarkable progress, but it still has decades more to go before it makes up for a hundred year late start. The US didn\u2019t have a late start. What is now the United States was a part of the British Empire when the industrial revolution started, and it played a key role in that industrial revolution. Britain had spent centuries cutting down its forests for homes and ships and fire wood and at the start of the industrial revolution deforestation was already a major issue. Steel production required immense quantities of wood to be turned into charcoal, and this hampered Britain\u2019s steel production capability. The American colonies, with their vast forests and untapped mineral wealth were a natural location for steel production, and the British capitalized on this. Already by 1776, more steel was produced in the thirteen colonies than Britain itself. The loss of these colonies would be one of the main reasons why Britain had to rely on coal in the 19th century. And steel was of course just one of the industries that took off easily in the Americas. By 1921, America had been outproducing Britain by a significant margin for many decades. But America was not just a colonial possession rich in raw materials like say the African colonies in the Victorian Era. The people in the American colonies were British: they saw themselves and were seen by others as the same people who lived in Britain. In 1700, if you had a person each from London, Edinburgh, and New York the Scotsman would culturally be the odd one out. Americans were welcome in European schools, and they set up schools of the same caliber in America from the very beginning. In fact, Americans placed quite a bit more emphasis on education than their European counterparts. Massachusetts implemented mandatory primary education a century before the Prussian System of Frederick the Great, and male literacy rates in New England were around 70% by 1750 whereas in England proper they were around 40% (and just 28% on the continent).This all meant that America had a population that could actively partake in the technological developments of the industrial revolution, and they did. While in Britain the Factory System was developed, which placed great emphasis on placing large numbers of workers in centralized locations (factories) for the mass production of goods, what would come to be known as the American System was simultaneously developed which placed its emphasis on adopting machinery and designing with interchangeable parts which would greatly reduce the need for skilled labor. The American System of Manufacturing would eventually be adopted throughout Europe and indeed the world, and is what we think of as manufacturing today. Britain was certainly pumping out many important technological developments of its own which were adopted rapidly by America, but the point is that America was never decades behind Britain, or anyone else, technologically. It also didn\u2019t hurt that many of Europe\u2019s best and brightest immigrated to America throughout this period. Modern China can produce goods on a remarkable scale, but their labor force lacks the expertise and technology for producing goods of the same caliber as modern America; a century ago American industry was not just superior in scale to Britain but it was also at the technological forefront. Next let\u2019s consider the military dichotomies. China is a land power. Located on the largest contiguous continent, surrounded by other major land powers, it has faced invasion time and again over its long history, and it now employs a very large army so that only the suicidal would consider invading it again. Now there are some important takeaways about the Chinese mindset here: a clear emphasis on the army, as opposed to the navy; an emphasis on overwhelming numbers; an acceptance of large numbers of casualties, and an acceptance of war on its own soil. America on the other hand is separated by vast oceans from every serious rival it ever faced, it was colonized by people from an island nation that relied for a thousand years on its navy to protect from invasion. In its civil war, the country learned that overwhelming industrial power won wars, and it was much better to be the invader than the invaded. In the modern day, China has a small navy, and essentially no force projection capability. In 1921, America was the sole power with the capability to deploy tens of millions of men to the other side of the world. Modern China is a regional power trying to play industrial catch up while modern America is the World\u2019s first hyperpower. In 1921, America had been Britain\u2019s economic and military peer for decades. If China stays on its present course for 50 more years, then we may see an analogous relationship. Britain had the world\u2019s largest navy, but America\u2019s was a very close second and was not spread nearly as thin. The US actually had planned to build a whopping 50 dreadnoughts and eclipse the Royal Navy during WW1, but these plans were abandoned after the war ended and the US actually scrapped 14 battleships in 1919. The Washington Naval Treaty was an admission by the British that their era of Naval hegemony had ended. This is not to say that Britain\u2019s navy was impotent; if war broke out they\u2019ed probably win more battles than they\u2019ed lose, at least at the outset of the conflict. But the notion that America would be powerless in the face of a British blockade is absurd. If Britain spread their fleet out along the American coasts, the American\u2019s would be able to concentrate their forces and wipe out the British squadrons one by one, and Britain would need to keep many of its forces close to home to protect against the first navy capable of invading it since Trafalgar. If anything, with its much smaller coastline and mineable approaches and lack of indigenous natural resources, it is Britain that would be at risk from blockade. I think it\u2019s very important to note that in WW1 it was Britain that was in desperate need of American supplies, not the other way around. Now proceeding a little further, let\u2019s consider how the war actually plays out. Canada is right on the border with the US, and with its dramatically smaller population and lack of defensive barriers, it would require significant material support to resist a US invasion. The British had plans for a war with America, and in them they don\u2019t even try to hold Canada. Once the fighting stops on the continent, necessarily it becomes about jockeying for naval supremacy. In addition to building ships, power projection requires naval bases where these ships can refuel and rearm. Small battles would break out all around the world as each nation tried to seize the other\u2019s bases and thus get the upper hand navally in each theater. America, with its much larger manpower pool and larger industrial base would be able to take greater risks, launch more attacks, and suffer more losses than the British. Even if Britain locally can sink American ships with impunity, America can simply launch more ships than the enemy is capable of sinking (this was the strategy America employed in WW2 with the Liberty Ships). Eventually Britain will be forced to abandon many of its bases and colonies to concentrate forces on the defense of more strategically important core regions. Meanwhile, given that Britain is now at war with the colony that declared its independence and achieved great prosperity, there would likely be many throughout the empire who would see this as an opportunity to emulate the Americans and rebel at this time. Even if the colonial population didn\u2019t, the British high command would need to keep forces in reserve in case they did. The Americans of course would be more than willing to supply and bankroll these endeavors. Finally, to prevent America from using them as a beachhead for an invasion of the home islands, Britain would need to occupy territory throughout northern Europe, which would further isolate it from trade partners and allies (not that there would be many countries willing to fight a major war so shortly after WW1) as well as spread its limited forces even thinner. At this point though, the war stalls. As Galipolli shows, the world\u2019s technology at this point in time was not reliably capable of massive WW2 style amphibious assaults. Britain could not land a sizeable force on American shores, but America would not be able to land a sizeable force on the home islands either. The Pacific and Indian Oceans would be under American control, but the Royal Navy would still be formidable in the North Atlantic. The British empire would have dramatically changed in size and distribution, but it would not fall. At this point either the powers agree to peace terms which would be highly favorable to the Americans, or the war devolves into a prolonged stalemate where Europe falls under the British sphere of influence and the rest of the world under American hegemony. Britain would likely pursue close ties with Japan to give it some influence in the Pacific. Ultimately though both Britain and Japan are island nations starved for natural resources. Resource rich America will be materially capable of breaking the stalemate in its favor long before Britain will. There was a time when the British could defeat the Americans, but by 1921 that era had long passed. Britain was a force to be reckoned with, and would make an American victory costly, but there is only so much one can do against an enemy with essentially limitless resources. Britain may survive, but only by giving up huge amounts of territory and power to the new, unquestioned hegemon. ",

            "answer_text": "The British Empire without landing a single troop on the American continent. The United States in 1921 was effectively the China of today; massive economic expansion fuelled by producing goods and selling them to foreign markets. As has been evident by the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs upon China, it relies heavily upon the import of raw materials it doesn\u2019t have/can\u2019t produce e.g. superconductors from the US. When the US banned exports to ZTE, China\u2019s largest telecommunication equipment producing company, (had it not been lifted) ZTE would have collapsed.[1] There are a great many parallels between China today and the US in 1921. Just as the US is doing now, the British could embargo the export of key materials such as Steel, Titanium, Zinc, Rubber etc which were needed to produce cars, consumer goods, railroads which helped to fuel the US economy. See the difference between the US today and the British empire in 1921 is size.   China can still import and export to large markets like the EU, Russia, India, Indonesia etc despite the US trade embargo. The difference is in 1921 (especially considering German and French industry was still in ruins from WW1) the US had very few options outside the British empire. Not only did the British have control over a vast proportion of the worlds key industrial mineral sources in primarily Africa (and hence the ability to embargo US production capacity); it also had the worlds strongest navy and there would be no Washington Naval treaty in 1922. Hence Britain produces further Admiral (Hood) Class battlecruisers and potentially even pursues the production of the G3 class battlecruisers only further increasing the capability gap by adequately replacing vessels scrapped as a result of the treaty. In a state of war the UK could embargo all trade by blockading the east and west coast ports not allowing even foreign merchant vessels access to US ports. Sure the US would probably invade Canada, but in a matter of months if not weeks US industry would cease to function leading to the collapse of the US war effort. The US didn\u2019t even have a carrier in 1921, its first wouldn\u2019t be completed until 1922. The Royal Navy had 4, all of which had been in commission by at least 1918. You can\u2019t fight a war, if you can\u2019t produce the materials and weapons needed to fight. The US surrenders in a matter a weeks if not months. Now I highly doubt there would be any sort of occupation by the British as the good o\u2019l second amendment would have made such an act a futile effort. I imagine reparations, arms restriction treaty and perhaps the annexation of Hawaii and maybe the Philippines into the British empire would be the outcome.
