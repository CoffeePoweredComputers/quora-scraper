            "answer_text": "He was a very clever and shrewd operator. Having won himself effectively unlimited power, he persuaded the Senate to give him any specific powers that he reckoned he needed, rather than simply taking them for himself without any gestures towards the old Republican system. He was generous in distributing largesse to the citizens of Rome - always a good way of ensuring popularity. He embarked on a programme of public works and restoration that enabled him to claim he had found a city of brick and left it a city of marble - an exaggeration but not totally untrue. He tried, through various laws, to reimpose on the Romans the moral codes attributed to earlier times: his social legislation was distinctly backward-looking, but well-intentioned. He established a system of administering the provinces that was less oppressive than had previously been the case: tax collecting was formalised and made simpler; the provinces that needed military defence were under the emperor\u2019s oversight, run by officers appointed by him, while the Senate was able to manage the rest and thus ensure carer paths for their members. He called an effective halt to the expansion of the Empire, and consolidated what Rome already held. This led to the so-called Pax Romana, which is a slight exaggeration: he carried out a lengthy war to subdue a large part of the Iberian peninsula; he sent expeditions into upper Egypt and into the Arabian peninsula; he had continuing troubles on the northern frontiers, culminating in the loss of Varus\u2019s legions in the Teutoberger Wald. Like later emperors, he worked hard to establish a succession, but had poor luck with this, as the chosen successors all died, leaving him, faute de mieux, with Tiberius, who was a very competent soldier but not really emperor material. Finally, just to make sure we all understood what a good emperor he was, he left behind a story - Res Gestae Divi Augusti - that tells all the good bits of his principate, and was put up in letters of stone all round the Empire. You just have to remember that from the time he inherited Caesar\u2019s name and wealth his early career was ruthless and destructive. But becoming lord of all he surveyed seems to have made him a lot nicer. It didn\u2019t, however, stop him from dealing drastically with anything that looked like a revolt against his rule. ",

            "answer_text": " Stability Augustus was the first emperor of Rome as well all know. Many would see this as a bad thing. Afterall he took a Republic and turned it into an autocratic nightmare and modern Americans tend to look down on that sort of thing. However, the truth is never so simple. In truth to the ascension of Augustus spelled nothing but good things for Rome. It not only enabled to Empire to experience a period of strong economic growth but it also stabilized the entire empire. Prior to Augustus the Republic had crumbled. Caesar and the Senate had fought a bloody civil war and people were afraid. But even before Caesar and Pompey were fighting the entire political system had broken down. Political mobsters roamed the streets attacking any the decided were their rivals. Populists took control and violence became the norm. People were afraid, afraid of being attacked, afraid of purges, afraid for their families, and afraid for the future and this fear was palpable. Even this political instability was not the beginning of Rome\u2019s troubles as another massive civil war between Marius and Sula had come right before. In this civil war, both sides held Rome for separate periods of time and would begin exterminating all political opposition. So 100 years prior to Augustus\u2019s reign there had been 2 massive and bloody civil wars, a total breakdown of political systems, and an endless series of political revolts. Augustus put an end to all of this. There were no more civil wars, no threat of civil wars, no political violence, and no economic turmoil. The economy was allowed to grow and people were allowed to prosper. Augustus brought peace to a generation that had known nothing but constant war and violence.  Peace As stated above peace was a huge and crucial part of Augustus\u2019s reign. This didn\u2019t only mean internal peace but peace throughout the Empire.  The \u201cPax Romana\u201d was a result of Augustus\u2019s reign. He secured peace with Parthia, Germania, and Illyria. Sometimes this meant he marched in at the head of some legions. Sometimes this meant he worked diplomatically with rival empires to secure lasting peace. Either way Rome would enter nearly 100 years of peace thanks to Augustus. The effects of this peace cannot be overstated. Free from threats of invasion or civil war Rome could realize its full potential. The legionaries could go home to their families and the Treasury could be spent on welfare and new building projects.  Intelligence Augustus was nothing short of a genius. His reign is one long success story because every action he took was well thought out. For instance He did not rule in public but in private. He never acted like an emperor but instead like another elected official. He WAS the emperor and in reality, the senate was stacked with his supporters and he would quietly give orders behind the scenes. This lead to a perfect image for him. Caesar made himself a king/dictator and look what happened to him. Augustus was keen to avoid this fate so he brilliantly consolidated more power than Caesar ever had while appearing to have limited power.He knew his limitations. The most intelligent people are the most keenly aware of their own faults. Augustus was no exception. He was not a military mastermind or a great day to day administrator. So he found people that were and put them into powerful positions. Competence. While Augustus was a brilliant politician and a skilled strategist he was not a great military man or an experienced leader. Instead of trying to be something he wasn\u2019t he instead leaned on his ling time best friend Agrippa.  It is hard to overstate how important Agrippa was to Augustus. Agrippa was the second in command of the whole empire. He was heir, the top general, the top bureaucrat, and the father of the other heirs. You can equally credit Agrippa for Rome's strength in this period. When historians say Augustus won the battle of Actium they mean Agrippa won the battle of Actium. When we talk about Augustan forces retaking Sicily from rebels it was Agrippa leading the legions. Agrippa could be counted on to win battles and make good choices. In fact, he is safely one of Rome's greatest military and tactical minds. More important than Agrippa's ability to win was his loyalty. Many generals were capable of squashing a barbarian army with some legions but they would then turn around and use those legions to take the throne. Agrippa never even considered this and was nothing but a hardcore loyalist and supporter of the Augustan regime. Despite not being a patrician Augustus married Agrippa to his only daughter Julia and adopted him into the Imperial family. Agrippa would be made heir but sadly died shortly after this. However, his many sons would go on to become legendary Romans themselves and would indeed go on to father Roman Emperors themselves.  Character On his death bed Augustus\u2019s final words were \u201cdid I play the part well, then applaud as I exit\u201d. Augustus in his final moments was still concerned with doing a good job. Was Augustus cruel? Yes, he was when he needed to be. Was Augustus kind? Yes, he was when he could be. He was a man who possessed the right character for the job. My favorite Augustus story: After defeating Antony Augustus returned to Rome and was hailed, Imperator. Imperator at this meant victorious general and not a leader as we use it. Augustus loved birds- it was a life long passion of his. Upon returning home a man approached him with a Revan that said \u201call hail Imperator Augustus\u201d and Augustus loved this. He bought the bird for a ton of money and thanked the man for bringing it to him. Then another man did the same and Augustus again bought it for an exorbitant amount of money. Pretty soon everyone was buying revens and training them to talk. One man spent his life savings to buy a top-shelf Revan. As he went about training the bird to speak the bird refused to say what it was told. The man, in frustration, said: \u201call my time and money wasted\u201d. The bird decided to say that instead of \u201call hail Augustus\u201d. Every day the bird would squawk \u201call my time and money wasted\u201d on repeat. The man would still take the bird out and about with him regardless. One day this man stumbled upon Augustus giving a speech. While the speech was going on the bird started squawking \u201call my time and money wasted\u201d. Augustus heard the bird and invited the man on stage to ask about it. The man explained what happened and that he had wanted to bird to say \u201call hail Imperator Augustus\u201d. Augustus found this hilarious. He had tons of birds that hailed his name but there was a bird that reminded him it may all end up being for naught. Augustus bought this bird for even more than all the others and prized it above the rest.  Accomplishments Created the first modern police forceCreated a stable economyCreated a stable administrationEnded all large threats to Rome through diplomacy or conquestAppointed skilled people to key positionsFunded countless building projectsConquered EgyptIt\u2019s hard to state how important this was. The wealth and food imports from Egypt are what allowed the Roman Empire to survive for another 500 years. Something like half of all food came from Egypt and the money Egypt generated was enough to pay for 60 legions. ",

He understood that he wielded absolute power, more so than any other king or dictator of Rome. He also understood that the Roman people never wanted a king. So what he did was cleverly restructure the government where the Senate was still functional, and he gave himself the name imperator. Augustus made sure that power did not go to his head. He dressed modestly, lived in a small villa (I visited the site when I went to Rome in 2010). He was also a just ruler who never abused his power. With all that, the Roman people could breathe a sigh of relief knowing that even though they had a figurehead more powerful than a king, he was one that did not act like a potentate. Unfortunately, the successors of Augustus did not learn by his example. As I said, this is a very simple answer.  ",
