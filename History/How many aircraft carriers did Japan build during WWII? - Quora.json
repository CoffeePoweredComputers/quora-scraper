            "answer_text": "The question shouldn\u2019t be how many aircraft carriers Japan had at the end of World War II, but how many were operational. After the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, the Japanese Navy no longer had the aircraft to equip its surviving aircraft carriers nor trained pilots to man them. In addition, due to the continuous toll of Japanese tankers by the U.S. submarine campaign, it no longer had the fuel oil to steam its surviving warships or gasoline to fly its airplanes. At the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944, the surviving Japanese aircraft carriers were used as decoys for its battleships with few operational aircraft. To answer your question though, the following aircraft carriers were still afloat (although damaged) in Japanese harbors at the end of World War II although none were operational. HOSHO (the first Japanese aircraft carrier, at Kure), JUNYO (at Sasebo), RYUHO (at Kure), KATSURAGI (at Kure). Several others remained sunk in harbor (KAIYO, capsized in Beppu Bay; ASO (launched, only 60% complete at Kure), IKOMA (launched, only 60% complete at Kobe), KASAGI, 84% complete at Nagasaki; IBUKI (converted heavy cruiser), 80% complete at Kure. Some ships, HOSHO and KATSURAGI, were disarmed and used to repatriate Japanese troops through approximately mid-1946 before being broken up, Others were scrapped in the immediate post-war era. ",
