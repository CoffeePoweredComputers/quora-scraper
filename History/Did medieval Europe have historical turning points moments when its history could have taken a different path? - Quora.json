            "answer_text": "The falacy in the question is that European history is a single homogenous narrative like that of the USA or Australia. It isn't. Even today Europe comprises 50 different sovereign states each with its own turbulent and violent history. However, to answer the question, I suppose two battles against the Muslims set the course of European history and set different historical trajectories for Eastern and Western Europe: Charles Martel\u2019s victory over the Iberian Muslims near Tours in 732 ensured that Western Europe remained Christian. If it hadn't happened the way it did, would Western European development through the periods of the Renaissance, Reformation, Enlightenment and Agricultural, Scientific and Industrial Revolutions or would Europe West of the Elbe/North Danube line have occurred or followed the same historical trajectory as North Africa and the Middle East?The second is the fall off Constantinople in 1453 which consigned Eastern Europe to Muslim domination until the defeat of the Ottomans at Vienna in 1683 at the hands of the Austrians and the Polish/Lithuanian coalition.If neither of these events had occurred, the narrative of Western development would not have panned out the way that it did. What the Americas would look like today is a matter for conjecture. I suggest that the people of the Anglosphere, of whatever ethnicity, owe Charles Martel a vote of thanks. ",
