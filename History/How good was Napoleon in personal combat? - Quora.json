            "answer_text": "Yves Granger is right, Napoleon was not a line soldier but a brave and courageous one, the man who said \u201cBravery comes from blood, courage comes from thought\u201d, and who almost invariably led from the front. Napoleon, then known only as Bonaparte, graduated from the Ecole Militaire of Paris in 1785 as an artillery lieutenant j.g. who soon rose through the ranks, reaching the grade of Major-general at the age of 26. Although he was wounded in action only once, his physical courage was never in doubt and he never flinched away from putting himself in harm\u2019s way, directly leading the action in all the wars he conducted. One of the most famous examples of his leading from the front was at the 1796 Battle of the Arcole Bridge in Italy.  The French assault against the Austrian forces was teetering on the edge. Trying to inspire his men to attack, Bonaparte grabbed a flag, standing up in the open, in spite of a withering fire which hit several among his staff and killed his own aide-de-camp. The three-day battle ended in French victory. Another battle, also in Italy, the 1797 Battle of Rivoli, cemented Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s reputation as an \u201chomme de guerre\u201d, a courageous general, a successful tactician and a brilliant strategist who, for more than 20 years, gave the coalition armies of Europe a run for their money albeit at a steep cost and a terrible \u201cbutcher\u2019s bill\u201d for France.

            "answer_text": "We know a bit about his physical constitution. His school report cited his weakness in exercise although he had a strong constitution. At Toulon, Barras noted that his soul seemed greater than his physical strength which added to his charm. In his lighter days as First Consul, he played prisoner\u2019s base, where he hardly was the most agile of the group, as he often fell, but picked himself up laughing. His greatest physical feats, include his intercontinental forays, as well as his ability to ride at full-speed all day long on horseback, such as the occasion when he went to see his sick mother. ",
