            "answer_text": "Lenin was a leader of Russian national liberation revolution. He came to power when the puppet Interim government controlled by the West destroyed Russian army, cultivated separatism in provinces and alienated peasants - 87% of Russian population. Thinking Russia is weak enough Western powers started a colonial war against our country Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War - Wikipedia Combination of direct aggression and using mercenary armies made of locals but paid, armed and directed by the West was used to rip Russia into pieces and colonize it. How weak was Russia at the moment can be illustrated by the fact that even Poland and Romania managed to rip off Russian territories, annex and colonize them until 1939. The leader of a backward agrarian nation without an army, that was butchered by all the the worlds imperialist predators can hardly be considered \u201cthe most powerful dictator\u201d. Lenin had nothing but the words of truth at his disposal to lead the nation in its fight for independence and territorial integrity. Peasants demanded nationalization of land and Lenin delivered. Peasants wanted to be at home when land is distributed and Lenin signed peace treaty with Germany. Interim government insisted on free market, even though all nations at war established state monopoly on food distribution to ensure nobody dies of hunger. Lenin established the same system in Russia. Interim government disbanded the police and amnested all the criminals plunging the cities into criminal terror. Lenin called factory workers to establish worker militia that safeguarded Russian cities. All these measures were taken under pressure of a huge majority of population and in the interests of this majority. None of them would be possible if not for willing and eager cooperation of the population. But sure enough, western imperialists who lost their chance to destroy and colonize Russia call Lenin a \u201cdictator\u201d. ",

So my answer to your question is Mao Zedong. ",
