            "answer_text": "Insanity as we call it can be of many types. If the one you are talking about a medical condition, most likely it has a physical or pathological origin at some point after birth or, it can be due to ageing , where nerve cells starts to die out or brain tissue shows malfunctions. Mental illness can also be induced by trauma perceived for a long time or a sudden shock. Psychological soundness and preparedness of a fully grown mind can withstand a lot of emotional pressure though, it can overwork the hormones and neurons to cause early symptoms. According to ongoing researches some people are more prone to such illness or mental conditions after severe trauma than others due to some genetic risk factors in the family tree, like Alzheimer's syndrome, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Autistic tendencies etc. No one learns insanity however, a person (or child) might mimic or learn to take advantage of habits from a mentally challenged person if it benefits them in some way.

            "answer_text": "\u201cInsanity\u201d is a strong term. I\u2019ll answer the question as if it said \u201cmentally ill.\u201d The vast majority of mental illness is the result of childhood trauma. There is evidence of a genetic correlation, meaning ones genes could predispose one to certain disorders, but there would still need to be the trigger of trauma. Some mental illness can be the cause of physical damage to the brain, which can be fixed by surgery. This is rare. Substance abuse could damage the brain, or other factors, like Alzheimer\u2019s etc. causing people to lose the ability to think normally, but such would not normally be classified as \u201cmentally ill,\u201d even though the behavior could be similar.
