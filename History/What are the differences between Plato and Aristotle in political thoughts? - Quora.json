            "answer_text": "We don\u2019t know Plato\u2019s political thoughts, because the Republic \u2014 usually considered the main source of information on that topic \u2014 is actually an allegory for the right governance of the individual soul. The elements and operations of the soul are likened to a highly artificial city; all the specific details of that city, including things like communism and social classes, are subordinated to his metaphorical purpose. Hence none can be considered representative of Plato\u2019s actual political views. In his Book 2 of his Politics, Aristotle reviews and criticizes Plato\u2019s political theories. However the consensus is that he is unusually and inappropriately literal in his interpretation of the Republic, and mostly uses it as a foil to present his own theories. In any case, Aristotle comes out strongly in favor or aristocracy as a form of good civil government. Plato\u2019s views we can, in truth, merely guess at. Possibly, having seen virtually every form of government fail in Athens, he may have been skeptical that any system can work as long as people remain foolish and unvirtuous. ",
