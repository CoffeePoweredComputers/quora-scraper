            "answer_text": "You mean the dark nights of the soul? Usually, before and it usually involves pain, a lot of emotional and psychological pain. If you preserve your integrity and morality you should experience your continual experiential transient Self-remembrances or non-dual glimpses within a couple years. This is yet full enlightenment. You are just awakening to the fact you\u2019re not a person as you transcend space, time, and individuality. With this you can train or get used to two potentialities: omnipresence and omniscience. This will become your second nature over time. The real awakening usually or in my case involves a severe shake to my core being that ultimately leads me to acknowledging that I\u2019m not a doer and nobody else is a doer either. That God is the only doer and that there are no coincidences at all. I came to that convincingly after noticing multiple patterns in my life that were impossible to be mere coincidences. Then you will see synchronicities in people, events, and numbers on daily or almost daily basis (usually the numbers are predominant: 111/1111, 222/2222, 333, 444, 555/5555, 777/7777, 888/8888/88888, 999/9999, 000/0000). This confirms you\u2019re manifesting or co-creating your reality. That your third and final potentiality has been realized. You are also freed from all forms of addictions and tendency to sin. You health improves too. Emotional baggage is also gradually diminished like stress, anxiety, insecurity, hate, anger, etc. You don\u2019t feel pain in your experiences as you have no preferential experiences. At first you may feel you lose excitement as nothing really matters. You don\u2019t prefer anything over anything else. But over time you can get back to life and enjoy it knowing that all is meant to facilitate your spiritual growth in the name of love for love. You know every man is devoid of existence, ultimately and you can live impersonally and humbly as you know you\u2019re not the author of your own thoughts and actions, ultimately and thus you learn to love yourself and others unconditionally. You stop sinning because every encounter becomes an encounter with God. You know the person whom you meet doesn\u2019t know that but it doesn\u2019t matter as you know that. Then sinning doesn\u2019t make sense as why would you sin against that which is in control of you too? Life is then just a ride with the illusion of free will and choice. Ultimately, you can make anything happen by willing it but the matter of the fact is that you can\u2019t will what you\u2019re not meant to will\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Look at where these fingers are pointing. Point your own finger in the same direction. LOOK where they are pointing, POINT your attention in the same direction.  You want an awakening? I\u2019ll give it to you:  DO you see anyone there? Do you see your name? Your occupation? Do you see your memories? Your ideas? Do you see anything there at all? Do you see anything there at all? Do you see anything there at all? This is the reason it can happen at anytime, in no time, do you see time where these fingers are pointing? Do you see space where these fingers are pointing? Do you see life where these fingers are pointing? No, what you see instead is the whole world filling up your view, the entire universe even closer than your fingertips. This is the pointing to the moon, you are the moon and sun and stars and earth and internet and computers and light and dark and thusness. Now do you imagine that you can look in this direction better or worse than someone else? Do you imagine being better or worse than anyone else at looking in the direction of these fingers? NO I THINK NOT. This is the reason teachers of enlightenment say that they have nothing to teach. It\u2019s because it\u2019s right in our space all along, nothing changes but you recognize that this is it, it\u2019s the whole world all at once, and it\u2019s totally, completely, stupendously unidentifiable. It is God, Soul, Devil, Tragedy, Love, Commitment, Desire, Sanity, Peace, Harmony, Clarity, Sensation, Change Change Change. Yes, changes will occur for the ones who really want to keep looking. But a new peace and freedom will be found through the search WITHIN. DO you see where within is now? It\u2019s not at all out there, it\u2019s where these fingers point.
