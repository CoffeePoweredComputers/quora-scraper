            "answer_text": "First of all, the Spanish were settled in before the \u201ccolonials\u201d! Actually, a number of voyages had been made to North America before Columbus. The Vikings had landed in the 11th century and the English fisherman were working the Newfoundland banks before 1492. Columbus had visited these regions with the Portuguese in the 1470\u2019s. Actually, there were two Kingdoms that joined to form one Spain. This was the year in which King Ferdinand had finally ended the Christian (Catholic) war to drive the Muslim Moors off of the continent north of the Mediterranean Sea. Eventually, he married Isabella who ruled the the second half of what became Spain. The Spanish people were into the Spanish Inquisition when Columbus landed in the Bahama Islands. Then he sailed to what is known now as Haiti where the Taino Indian's were literally screwed, sodomized, and the children were raped, sodomized and made slaves. The Spanish exterminated the Indians by hand or by diseases like syphilis and ghonerra, measles, influenza, and a host of other diseases that the \u201ccivilized foreigners\u201d brought to the New World\u201d. Over 95 percent of the \u201cIndians\u201d in North America perished from diseases that the 'civilized' introduced to the New World. The Spanish had received a grant for the New World along with the Portuguese with the majority going to the Spanish. The English and French literally invaded the Spanish lands. The Spanish were under strict orders to treat the Indians with respect. The English and the French organized their unwanted men to \u201csettle or squat\u201d on Spanish land and their ships to overtake the Spanish ships\u2026especially the ones carrying gold and silver and other treasures. The French lost all their rights to land in America in 1783. Of course the English lost their rights in 1776. Ok then, the Spanish literature was superior--by far, than the French or especially the English. The Spaniards were the most like the Romans and many Romans who were driven out of Rome when the Barbarians (Goths and others) plundered Rome and the Emperor Constantine moved the capital of Rome to what we call Istanbul today. It was called Constantine then. At any rate, the Spanish were direct descendents of the aristocratic Romans and they kept \u201cexcellent\u201d records. Take for instance, Christopher Columbus's voyages and Americus Vespucci's and ANY Spanish vessel at that time\u2026 There was the crew's log and written record-number 1. Then the Catholic Church had there observer and recorder of what they saw. And Third, the state or rather the King had his group on any voyage recording events as they saw them. Actually, Hernando de Soto had the three same groups recording his travels through the southeast United States where they burned the Natives alive, cut their feet off or their hands above the wrist. They often cut the noses off of the Indians and\u2026well I must refer you to what I said earlier. The French had but two factions recording events: the King's recorder and perhaps the Pope's men. The English only had the Captain's log. What became Great Britain had many crude languages at this time. ",
