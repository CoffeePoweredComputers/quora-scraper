If you don\u2019t look in the absolutely right place it can be difficult to spot cave paintings, Nasca lines, pyramid ruins, or painted-over church paintings. The world is a big place to hide old art. There is probably very little reason for anyone to fake a cat in Peru, so I imagine it is legit. It\u2019s not as if someone can collect a million dollars for the discovery\u2026 ",
