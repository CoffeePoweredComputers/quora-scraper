            "answer_text": "The difference between British and Chinese soldiers is vast. Whereas the British Army is made up of professional and reserve soldiers, who live in a democracy and can leave the service after an agreed number of years. The Chinese are obligated to serve in the People\u2019s Liberation Army ( PLA). It is the sacred duty of every Chinese citizen between the age of 18 to 24 years to serve in the PLA that will be of 24 months duration. China is not a democracy and the population have no say in how long they serve within the armed forces. The last armed conflict between the British and Chinese armed forces was during the 1950s Korean War. June 1950. The North Korean Army launched an all out offensive against the South. The United Nations (UN) Security Council called upon it\u2019s members to support the Republic of Korea, and American forces were deployed to South Korea. They were joined by many other nations including Britain. At first the North Koreans made rapid progress, quickly taking the South Korean capital of Seoul and driving the South Korean and American troops back to the southern port of Pusan. British troops landed at Pusan and were sent straight in to battle at Naktong, on the western part of the Pusan defences.  September 1950. After an American and South Korean amphibious landing at Inchon 150 miles (240km) behind enemy lines that cut the North Korean communications lines. UN Forces rapidly pushed the North Korean army over the boarder and captured the North Korean capital Pyongyang. November 1950. As President Truman has dismissed Chinese warnings that the advancing UN forces towards the North Korean boarder would result in war. November 1950. The Chinese Liberation Army (PLA) intervened on a massive scale, that halted the UN advance. The UN forces were pushed all the way back to Seoul. The Armies. The 29th British Independent Infantry Brigade held a vital sector of the UN line. Commanded by Brigadier Tom Brodie, it comprised of the 1st Battalion Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, 1st Battalion Royal Gloucestershire Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel James Carne, 1st Battalion Royal Ulster Rifles and an attached Belgian Battalion. Supporting was a tank squadron of the 8th Kings Royal Irish Hussars, 45 Field Regiment Royal Artillery and the 170th Indipendent Mitterrand Battery. The Chinese offensive was commanded by General Peng Dehuai involving 300,000 troops attacking over a 40 mile front (64km). In Brodie\u2019s sector, his men faced three divisions of General Yang Dezhi\u2019s Army.  Chinese Liberation Army (PLA) flag.  Chinese Liberation Army propaganda poster. Edit: l have been informed by a Chinese contributor the the above text is in fact anti propaganda. The Battle. The 29th Brigades Battalion we\u2019re positioned on a hilltop south of the Imjin river while the Belgian Battalion was north of the river on Hill 196. The frontage was more suited to a Division than a Brigade but it was ment only as a temporary line so the positions were neither mined of or had the benefit of barbed wire. The Battalion were widely dispersed and unable to provide mutual support. To the rear lay the 8th Hussar\u2019s tanks and the guns of 45 Field Artillery Regiment. There was no medium or heavy artillery support available.  On the night of the 22nd April Chinese infantry waded across the Imjin river. On the left flank the Gloucestershire Regiment were heavily engaged, as were Northumberland Fusiliers to the east, with the two Battalions separated by the heights of Akamai San. The Chinese reconnaissance of the area showed the Chinese the disposition of 29 Brigade and the gaps between units. The Chinese military tactics in the 1950s was for thousands of troops attacking the enemy that was reminiscent to the tactics used during WW1, they also used bugle calls and flags as a mode of communication, Should the first wave of attacking troops fail then a second wave of troops would attack, their commanders had little or no regard for the number of casualties.  Chinese Army bugle recovered from the Gloster Vally on the Imjin. As dawn broke on the 25th April, the valley was shrouded in mist allowing the Chinese to infiltrate undetected. The 8th Hussar\u2019s tanks were ordered to advance up the valletly and render fire support to the Fusiliers and Riflemen, they were attacked by hordes of Chinese soldiers throwing sticky bombs at the tanks, these soldiers were machine gunned by other tank crews. Tanks reached the Royal Ulster Rifles and they moved forward to occupy Hill 398 to the east of the Fusiliers and route 11 that was the only possible line of withdrawal for the Brigade. The soldiers of the Northumberland Fusiliers, Glosters and Ulster Rifles has been reduced to hand to hand fighting with bayonets and even fists against the Chinese and still drove them back. On the night of the 23rd-24th April the Chinese reinforcements crossed the Imjin with orders to eliminating the Glosters the fighting continued with mounting casualties on both sides. On the 24th April an attempt was made to reinforce the Glosters, but the attempt failed as the Chinese now surrounded them. The Glosters were now on their own clustered on Hill 235 under repeated attacks and mortar fire. Throughout the whole action air strikes were called in but the Chinese were well trained in going to ground until air attacks had ceased, they then continued their attacks after suffering limited casualties during these air attacks. By now the entire Chinese 63rd Brigade was across the Imjin river and were threatening to trap the battalions. But still the Fusiliers, Glosters and Ulster Rifles clung on, repelling attack after attack and even directed their own artillery fire on to their positions. By mid-morning the order was given to withdraw. The exhausted men of the Fusiliers and Ulster Rifles were forced marched to safety along Route 11 which was covered by enemy fire. Tanks from the Hussars provided covering fire, The withdrawal was slow and many of the wounded and exhausted troops were loaded on to the rear of tanks, the Chinese inflicted many casualties on the men riding on the tanks. Only the Glosters had not withdrawn, that night they were given permission to break out from their positions, but as they were encircled most were killed or captured by the Chinese. The Brigade has lost a quarter of its strength, suffering 1,091 casualties, the Chinese casualties were estimated at 70,000. Edit: It has been stated that the 70,000 figure was for the whole Imjin battle and that the Imjin River Battle was in the region of 10,000 Chinese casualties. All units of the 29th Brigade has fought with great courage, but the Gloucestershire Regiment and 107 Battery 45 Field Regiment Royal Artillery were both awarded a US Presidential Unit Citation, the highest American award for heroism and collective gallantry.  These men attending a roll call after there withdrawal are the remainder of the Gloster Regiment, the rest of the regiment were either killed or captured.  The UN Korean Medal. ",
