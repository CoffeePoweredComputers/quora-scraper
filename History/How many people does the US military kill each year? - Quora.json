            "answer_text": "I read that question like your trying to suggest our military is walking about the world just killing whenever , wherever and whoever they want. Then they tally up all the bodies and have a party. Our brave courageous soldiers defend you and all of us every day. Now, in defense of this country they remove a threat. Then maybe you could just say thank you for your service. But in the course of the day, those who would do that soldier or this great nation harm can be engaged, then bet your ass theyll be eliminated. What gets me about questions like this, is how it doesn\u2019t matter how many US soldiers die in a year in our defense. No! your asking how many we \u201ckill\u201d Have you ever considered how many enemies you have out there. They don\u2019t care how tolerant and well adjusted you are. They don\u2019t care about your Feelings and opinions. They want you and your friends, family, and neighbors dead. Do you understand that? Do you really think if you could talk to them, they would listen to your mindless meaningless babble, give you a hug and all would be well? You ignorance and attitude suggests you\u2019ve never been touched by death in your family by our enemies. And I and many like us are untouched by it as well. That\u2019s what a great job our soldiers and military are doing , protecting us, and all we hold dear. NOT KILLING PEOPLE EACH YEAR!! ",

            "answer_text": "This varies every year. When I was on active duty, we were not in a war, so not many were killed. In 1991, when I was reactivated for Desert Storm, the number went up. So it is hard to give an average, because it varies so widely. But let\u2019s choose the Iraq war, which had several time periods. We\u2019d want to include the friendly forces lost, as well as those who are casualties. Battle losses etc: https://www.defense.gov/casualty.pdf Iraq war casualties Casualties of the Iraq War - Wikipedia Official estimates of Iraq War casualties range from 110,000 to 460,000. Iraq war logs: Classified US military documents released by WikiLeaks in October 2010, recorded 176,382 injuries, including 99,163 civilian injuries between January 2004 and December 2009. I am not sure if we can give a definitive number. But the current US Military is in deadly business, and it\u2019s very good a breaking things and killing people. ",
