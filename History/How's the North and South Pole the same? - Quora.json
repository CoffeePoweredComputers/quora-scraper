            "answer_text": "They have little similarities other than the obvious. Both magnetic poles are moving quickly in a migration across the Earth after wandering in the same area for a very long time. It is easier to list the differences. The South Pole is a continent, the North Pole is an ocean. The poles are oppositely charged. Cosmic rays, high energy charged particles from stars, that cause chemicals in the atmosphere to ionize into chemicals that deplete the ozone layer are more attracted to the South Pole so ozone depletion is higher there. When one is closer to the Sun in the winter the other is closer to the Sun in the summer. Little of the North Poles seasonal ice is on land, but most of Southern ice is on land. The Northern ice is melting very rapidly annually, but the Southern ice is losing little ice annually. That is the net ice melt from the ice melt and the ice buildup each year. The North has polar bears as the top predator, and the south has sea lions. Penguins live only in the South. Ice crystals form in the upper atmosphere over the South polar region but not so much over the North. ",

            "answer_text": "the only two commonly known similarities (\u2026the same\u2026) between the two are (that this author is aware of); they are at the extreme \u2018top\u2019 and \u2018bottom\u2019 of the Earth;where \u2018top\u2019 and 'bottom\u2019 refer to mankind\u2019s representation, in cartography, of the magnetic orientation, North (top) and South (bottom);and both are extremely cold.there are many dissimilarities between the two; the South pole lies above the continent of Antarctica, whereas the North pole is an ice sheet, a thick sheet, but still only ice;the length of the period of daylight hours vary at both extremities due to the Earth's axial 'tilt\u2019 to the N;the tilt of the axis to the N renders the period of daylight hours slightly longer than the opposite period of night hours at the N Pole;thus, at the S, the periods of daytime is shorter and night longer than the N;animal and flora life differ vastly;water drains down holes, as in the bathtub or kitchen sink, in different directions;clockwise (S) and anti-clockwise (N);which I still want to know, if, at the equator, does water go straight down (or not drain at all, which would defy gravity, so not that);it is interesting to note that at both Poles the magnetic location varies from the geological fixed position from 'time-to-time\u2019, and that neither is magnetically at the man-made geological spot;this is both a similarity and a dissimilarity where both magnetic N and S vary, but at different degrees of variation",
