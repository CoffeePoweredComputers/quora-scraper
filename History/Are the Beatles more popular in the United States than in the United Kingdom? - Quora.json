            "answer_text": "Well, Yes. And to address that, let\u2019s look at sales. What better measure of popularity then to judge them by than the number of people willing to lay out their hard-earned money for them. Beatles album sales by country: United States: 209.1 Million Canada: 13.6 Million United Kingdom: 7.5 Million (Numbers From: The Beatles Total Albums Sold - Statistic Brain ) From those numbers, it appears the beatles were 27.88 times more popular in the US than in the UK, and 1.81 times more popular in Canada than in the UK. The numbers look different if skewed by the relative population size of the countries, but the order remains the same. Albums sold per person: United States: 650 albums per 1000 population. Canada: 346 albums per 1000 population. United Kingdom: 117 per 1000 population. So you can see - the Beatles were anywhere from 5 to 25 times more popular in the US than in the UK. They were also from 2\u20133 times more popular in Canada than in the UK.  ",

It was music for our mums.(My brother who is two years older had seven Pauls in his class) . When I talk to American friends around the same age as me they all seem to love the Beatles will rave over the White Album and all can remember where they were when Lennon was murdered. ",
