            "answer_text": "There were many estates and manor houses serving as examples, and as other answers have noted, the topology, history, flora/fauna, or agriculture of the surrounding area often played a part, as did old family names. An author would want to avoid using the actual name of an existing place, so an adaptation might be in order. \u201cThornfield\u201d might have been an adaptation of \u201cThornhill,\u201d of which Bronte may have been aware. And few self-respecting Victorian novelists could resist packing a name with metaphorical meaning. In a sense, Jane enters a field of thorns when she arrives at her new place of employment. There\u2019s a dangerous past history intruding into the present, and in reaching for the rose of romance with Mr. Rochester, Jane endures many unexpected pains. The allusion to a beautiful rose hiding painful thorns is pretty thick on the ground in literature, and Bronte would have known a lot more than modern readers usually do. Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnet XXXV: No more be grieved at that which thou hast done: Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud: Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun, And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud. All men make faults . . . ",

            "answer_text": "They used their imaginations like any writer from any era. Use your brain to work out what Thornfield might mean. What usually grows in fields? Crops. Useful edible crops, like wheat or oats or cabbages. What does a thorn sum up to you? Something sharp and prickly and harmful. A field full of thorns would be harsh and dangerous (imagine Sleeping Beauty surrounded by impenetrable thorn bushes) Hence, Thornfield Hall is likely to be a harsh, bleak forbidding, uncomfortable place, as indeed it is in Jane Eyre.
