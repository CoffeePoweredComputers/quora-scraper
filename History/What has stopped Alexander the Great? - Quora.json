            "answer_text": "I am reproducing below, an extract from my book on Dr. Mathra Singh (Buy Shadow in the Fog Book Online at Low Prices in India) which is taken from the annexure showing history of Panjab: Alexander sent ahead a messenger with a letter asking Porus to surrender or suffer the consequences of war with the \u2018great king of kings, son of Philip of Macedon and addressed Porus as king of India. Porus gave a fitting reply, addressing him merely as Alexander the Greek, and reminding him that in times past king Philip of Macedon was himself a subject, paying tribute to the empire of Cyrus the Great and hence of no consequence. Porus challenged him to face his army which was not afraid to kill all the invaders. The battle eventually took place along the River Jhelum at a place not yet fully identified but is popularly thought to be near Bhera in Panjab. Alexander was also a little aprehensive as his army was going to face the massive elephants for the first time, indeed even seeing them for the first time. Eventually, a fierce battle took place and both the armies suffered heavy casualties. As Alexander\u2019s army was already reduced in strength due to constant wars over the last many years (inspite of regular replacement of his troops from Macedon, Greece and Persia), he prudently thought that if he were to proceed further, he would be decimated completely, mirroring the thoughts of his troops as well. Alexander\u2019s army therefore retreated back and went on to Babylon, then in Persia. Even while going back also, Alexander\u2019s army was constantly harried by Indian kingdoms. In a campaign at Sangala in Panjab, the Indian attack was so ferocious it completely destroyed the Greek cavalry, forcing Alexander to attack on foot. In the next battle, against the Malavs of Multan, he was felled by an Indian warrior whose arrow pierced Alexander\u2019s breastplate and ribs. These injuries perhaps led eventually to his death in Babylon. (Author\u2019s note: this description is taken from many alternate sources as Greek sources alone should not be relied upon as they have been found to be biased and depict different stories of this battle but all concluding as Alexander having won the battle.) Porus, having won was able to include the kingdom of Taxila and some more northern kingdoms as spoils of his victory and became even more powerful. Chandragupt, the emperor of the mighty kingdom of Magadh, entered into an alliance with Porus, giving Chandragupta a composite and powerful army made up of the Greeks, Kambojas, Scythians, Kiratas, Parasikas and Bactrians. Porus was probably killed by mistake by the Indian ruler Rakshasa around 320 BCE, who was trying to assassinate Chandragupt instead. Even after death, while Ambhi has been relegated to a footnote of history, Porus is still held in high esteem throughout India. End of extract. ",

            "answer_text": "Battle fatigue. If I were Alexander I would have done a few things differently Attack Magadha in a short quick devastating blitzkrieg and demand a surrender. The Nandas were hugely unpopular- their unpopularity was so legendary , stories of their wealth are there in the Tamil language too.The point is with the size of the standing army of the Nandas as reported to Alexander- the very news that terrified the Greek soldiers, they didn\u2019t attack Alexander- not when he was campaigning, not when he was not campaigning. They did nothing. The fear the Greek soldiers had never materialised! To understand this read : Mahmud of Ghazni - operations such as he had done.Take more break at each point , pacify the lands, win over the local populations , establish state and governance machineryAfter tactical objectives met quickly return to Macedonia or Babylon and establish strong central government.Basically closer to Seleucus Nicator (yes the man who lost to Chandragupta Maurya). Do not forget that Alexander was able to supply his armies and wage battle away from home for so long. Have any of his opponents done it in this manner ? ",
