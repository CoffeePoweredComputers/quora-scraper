            "answer_text": "As the other answers point out, America imposed a Constitution on Japan that mandated democracy. But this was not something entirely new to the Japanese. The previous Constitution, promulgated in 1890, had also called for democratic institutions of a sort, and the ensuing three decades showed promise of developing into a full-flowered democracy (the era was called the Taisho Democracy, after the era of Emperor Taisho 1912\u20131926). It could easily have evolved into a European style Prime Ministerial democratic state but then got hijacked by the militarists in the 1930s.

            "answer_text": "Japan became a democratic nation after adopting a new constitution while still under American occupation. The power of the military, the driving force behind the disastrous Japanese imperial adventure during the war, was substantially curtailed so that an elected parliament could govern the country. The emperor was still allowed to be the head of state albeit with just symbolic power. ",
