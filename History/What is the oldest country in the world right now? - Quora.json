            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Oldest continuous government with an uninterrupted continuum of heads of states is the Roman Empire, Ottoman Empire, Republic of Turkey continuation. Roman Empire had its first full-time head of state, as imperator, in Octavianus Augustus before the turn of the millennium. Roman Emperor Constantine moved the capital to today\u2019s Istanbul and the bulk of the empire continued in the East. When Odokavar conquored Rome, he acknowledged the Roman Empire continued, was inherited and represented by the East and that he had no claim on it. The Roman Empire continued under Justinian to rule most of Augustus\u2019 Roman Empire. They never ever used modern invented terminology such as Byzantine Empire or Eastern Roman Empire. It was Imperium Romanum only. In 1453 Muhammad son of Murad gained control of Istanbul, continued all Roman governmental institutions, declared himself as the next Roman Emperor, and his claim was recognised by existing religious and secular establishment. The old imperial families supported the Roman-Ottoman empire by being governors and bureucrats in it. Sultan Muhammad printed coins as Roman Emperor. Europe, except Hapsburg Austria (Holy Roman Empire), recognised him as the Roman Emperor diplomatically by accepting his superiority until the Treaty of Karlowitz 1699, where the Ottoman Empire was demanded to address Austria as the Roman Empire and accept being equal to it. Ottoman Empire was ended by the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 with the new recognised Turkish state in Ankara inheriting all of the Ottoman State with its financial debts. With no interruptions (apart from a short dispute during the crusades) Augustus Imperator\u2019s seat with legal inheritance came to the modern times as President of the Republic of Turkey. Official language changed from Latin to Greek to Turkish. Main religion changed from Roman polytheism to Orthodox Christianity to Islam. But it is the same seat. ",
