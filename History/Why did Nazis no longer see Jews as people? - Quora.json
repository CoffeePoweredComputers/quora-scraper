            "answer_text": "This is a minefield and I'm afraid that I might step on a few hidden mines if I answer but here goes: (a) Jews were believed to be parasites on society that contributed nothing useful to society. They were believed to be involved in the 1920s Jazz-era degradation of Weimar Germany. However, one has to remember that the Nazis were a 'conservative' revolutionary movement, meaning they looked to the distant Germanic past for their heroes and part of their ideology. Hatred of Jews was nothing new in Germany but before the Nazis had always been on the fringe of society. (b) Some of the Nazis, Himmler (in particular), believed that the Jews were fighting an eternal battle with the Aryan race. In much the same way, many current white nationalists feel the same way. You see this attitude in various ways in current American society, though no one really talks about it out loud. Remember, because of prohibitions during the Middle Ages on Jewish activities, they went into banking, jewelry, etc. - trades that were considered 'beneath' the nobles of the time who considered money 'dirty'. Hence, it was believed that there was a massive Jewish conspiracy (see books like \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\") because they seemed to be monopolizing banking, loans, etc. Therefore, when Hitler came to power it became fairly easy for him to play on people's fears. With all due respect to Joe Bernson it wasn't a national 'psychosis' - the country itself did not go crazy - regardless of acts like the 'Kristallnacht' and the Holocaust - those involved in it were completely sane and knew what they were doing. If they were crazy, there would have been no use in having the Nuremberg Trials, as the 'perpetrators' would have been considered 'criminally insane'. Sorry, but you can't have it both ways. The nation itself voted for Hitler and the Nazis because the Nazis gave ordinary Germans a sense of community that they never had before (remember, Germany was a new nation - it was united under the Prussian monarchy after the Frano-Prussian War) and 'national' groups really didn't come to the fore in Germany until after the First World War. Finally, you have to ask yourself - if you are anti-pornography, anti-interest, anti-'filth', anti-Communist, anti-political correctness, anti-radical politics, and you feel that your country has been 'stabbed in the back' by spineless politicians from a different race and that race had members involved in everything that you hated, wouldn't you blame every member of that race? To modern people (especially in the West), who have been brainwashed by almost 70 years of 'judge a man based on his character, not the color of his skin' - it's hard to understand how a country could do what the Germans did; however, try to look at the 'evidence' the way the Nazis looked at it - Jews created both capitalism and communism, Jews are responsible for the moral degradation of 'our' women and 'our' children with miscegenation, Jazz (or now, Rap) and various forms of popular culture. If you take a step back and look at it rationally, it makes sense somewhat. The German nation was blamed for WW1, even though they didn't start it. Hitler and many of the leading Nazis were WW1 vets (and they lost) and they were looking for someone to blame. Who better than an 'alien' race who doesn't share 'our' values? Especially when members of that 'alien' race look different, act differently, believe differently, isolate themselves and some are very well-known Communists (something that the Nazis hated with a fervor) - Marx, Engels, Lenin, Trotsky, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "It came down to the racial philosophies of the Nazis. They reclassified people into different races essentially then treating them as a different species. By redefining Jews in this way it meant they were not seen as human but as an inferior species that were there to pollute and degrade the superior species of the Aryans. Redefining the Jews in this manner it meant that the normal way we view each other which creates empathy towards our fellow human beings was bypassed and this not only enabled ,but encouraged, the treatment of Jews as nonhuman victims ",
