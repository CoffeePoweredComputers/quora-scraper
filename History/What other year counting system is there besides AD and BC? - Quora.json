            "answer_text": "There are over 30 different calendar dating systems, many built on faith, including the Gregorian (Christian) BC and AD. These include diverse units such as Solar phases or even animals (year of the Fire-Monkey). To provide a more unified dating system for use in education and science, the most commonly used dating units now are BCE (Before Common Era) and CE (Common Era) as these are supposedly a-religious, despite being based on the Christian BC and AD. They are now the accepted dating unit of the United Nations and in European educational establishments. Sciences still use other criteria. Archaeologists, for example, employ the unit BP which stands for Before Present. However, in this case \u2018present\u2019 is counted as 1950 for reasons I won\u2019t bore you with. So, 200BC = 200BCE or 2150BP. Even more specialised science, such as radiocarbon dating, use Calibrated BP and for longer time periods (used in geology) the convention is to use kya and mya for kilo-years ago (thousands) and mega-years ago (millions).
