            "answer_text": "To answer this I\u2019m going to use a nifty document that was available in 2019 and I\u2019ll have to see if they have a 2020 addition now or soon-ish. It\u2019s the World Air Forces 2019 document from Flight International. They appear to do their best to not only look at what aircraft each country has in each armed service branch but also to focus on how many are actually active/useable. Now to keep this simple we will go with exactly the Top 10 ranking that they have. Though I still highly recommend looking it up online and downloading the PDF. 10. Turkey: 1,067 active aircraft.9. Egypt: 1,092 active aircraft.8. France: 1,248 active aircraft.7. Pakistan: 1,342 active aircraft.6. Japan: 1,572 active aircraft.5. South Korea: 1,614 active aircraft.4. India: 2,082 active aircraft.3. China: 3,187 active aircraft.2. Russia: 4,078 active aircraft.1. USA: 13,398 active aircraft. Of course this is all branches for each country combined but I don\u2019t see that as an issue since not every country has a distinct \u201cAir Force\u201d. Also this isn\u2019t so much qualitative as it is quantitative. I think an important factor though is that \u201cactive\u201d means the aircraft are likely operable and this means the country in question is capable or \u201cpowerful\u201d enough to keep these numbers of aircraft working where other countries wouldn\u2019t be able to sustain the numbers.
