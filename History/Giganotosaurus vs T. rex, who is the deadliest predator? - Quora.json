            "answer_text": "Giganotosaurus vs T. rex, who is the deadliest predator?  Before there was the ridiculous Tyrannosaurus vs Spinosaurus debate raging non stop there was the just as ridiculous Tyrannosaurus vs Giganotosaurus debate. This is the original mega theropod showdown the original clash of the titans. These were both huge and very powerful animals and would have been the apex predators of there times and yes both of these animals lived millions of years apart and on different parts of the earth they never ever met. Even if we could somehow bring these titans together there's a good chance they would not even fight big predators tend to avoid conflict because they really don't want to get hurt and risk getting a serious injury that could prevent them from hunting. But let's take a look at these apex predators and see who would have had the advantage if this fight could off ever happened. Let's pretend they are having a conflict regarding food or territory dispute. Giganotosaurus Carolinii the giant southern lizard  Giganotosaurus skeleton  Giganotosaurus was one of the largest theropods that ever walked the earth but because we do not have a lot of fossil remains for the animal its maximum size is hard to determine. When Giganotosaurus was first described it was quite over-exaggerated with many estimations stating it was around 12 to 13 or 14 to even 16 meters long and weighed around 8 to 10 to over 15 tons and a lot of this information still exists on the internet. So because of these older size estimates Giganotosaurus is often exaggerated in the media and in video games similar to how Spinosaurus and other Dinosaurus are. So yes the supermassive version of Giganotosaurus featured in the video game ARK is very very inaccurate well, to be honest, all the dinosaurs in that game are inaccurate in fact I think they look pretty damn bad sorry back to the question. The below picture is a classic example of how Giganotosaurus was sometimes over-exaggerated in older dinosaur books.  Out of date size comparison from 1997  Yes there was once a time when we believed that Giganotosaurus was so large that its entire skull was nearly as long as the whole torso of a Tyrannosaurus rex. The above size comparison from 1997 is one of the older ones that still exist on the internet while it is very impressive it is out of date. We now have more accurate measurements on both of these animals. The holotype specimen for Giganotosaurus that is also the best-preserved specimen is estimated to be around 12.2 to 12.4 meters long and is estimated to weigh around 7.5 tons so a very large animal. The largest specimens of Tyrannosaurus we have so far are over 12 meters long and are estimated to weigh over 9 tons specimens such as Sue and the recently described Scotty are both estimated to weigh over 9 tons with some higher-end estimates putting their weights at over 10 tons. Making them the most massive theropods known to science so far. Quote from Franoys \u201cTyrannosaurus rex has the most robust hind limbs of any member of the theropoda, the mid-shaft femur circumference of the largest specimens is only matched by Deinocheirus mirificus specimen MPC-D 100/127, which with a femoral circumference of 560 mm, matches those of Tyrannosaurus specimens RTMP 81.12 1 and Samson (560 mm), but still outsized by those of RSM 2523.8 (590 mm) MOR 1128 (580 mm), and FMNH PR 2080 (580 mm). The tibia also have the biggest circumferences of any member of theropoda, and they are also the longest. Femoral and tibial circumferences have allometric physical correlations with body mass since they are weight bearing bones, meaning this could be further indication of Tyrannosaurus having the most massive theropod specimens within it (as indicated by Campione et al 2014).The femoral tibial and fibular condyles are very wide and robust, and so is the femoral head, therefore the joints were adapted to withstand a lot of stress. Tyrannosaurus also has the longest ilia registered in theropoda, meaning the ischiotibialis was very wide and massive, the forth trochanter is very well developed so the legs were powered by big muscles as well and they were the most massive between those of it's kind.\u2009\u201d Tyrannosaurus rex the tyrant lizard king  Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton by Vitamin Imagination  The specimen of Tyrannosaurus known as Sue is around 12.3 meters long and weighs around 9.2 to 9.7 tons while the newly described Scotty was even more massive its femur measures around 133 cm in length with a circumference of 59 cm. Sue\u2019s femur measures 132.1 cm in length and only has a circumference of 57.5 cm. While Scotty\u2019s skull is mostly complete, the length estimate of 161 cm that\u2019s 9 cm more than Sue\u2019s estimated skull length. Based on the skull and femur size its likely Scotty measured between 12.67 and 13.08 meters and could have weighed anywhere from 8,870 (9.7 tons) to 10,490 kilograms (11.5 tons). This makes Scotty the new record holder for largest T. rex and land carnivore just surpassing the previous record-holder that was Sue. Scotty the most robust and largest land predator currently known.  Scotty replica mount  Scotty surpasses Sue in 11 out of 13 bone measurements. Scotty's hip girdle is more robust than Sues is. This is important because the hip girdle is the center mass bearing structure for a theropod dinosaur. Besides being quite a bit thicker than Sue, the rest of its body collectively implies a much brawnier body shape than other big theropods. Plus a comparison of cubic femoral dimensions gives a much greater overall weight. The latest study regarding Scotty describes its shoulder bones, hips and it's leg bones and they are all larger with Scotty than the corresponding bones in the Sue specimen. Quote from W. Scott Pearsons \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until now we\u2019ve been able to take a step back and look at the specimen as a whole, \u201cAnd doing so there\u2019s an oh gosh moment because the specimen really is enormous.\u201d \u201cWe looked at this from a number of different angles. Obviously the best way to do it is the direct one-to-one comparisons through the various skeletal elements,\u201d Persons said. \u201cWhen you look at everything from the shoulder to the hip to the leg to portions of even the toe bones, yes, Scotty the Tyrannosaurus rex comes out consistently just a smidgen-bit larger than Sue.\u201d Both Sue and Scotty had their weights estimated in the latest study. The method used to calculate the mass in the latest study was the same for both of the specimens and the data shows that Scotty is heavier than Sue is. The latest study put Scotty's weight at an estimated 8870 kg(9.7 tons) while Sue is estimated at 8462 kg(9.3 tons) Scotty's weight compared to other big theropods going from its femur  This is also not the first time that Scotty has been estimated to out mass Sue. There was a study conducted back in 2014 that estimated the weight for some of the large theropod dinosaurs and both Sue and Scotty were included. This older study concluded that Sue was around 7377 kg (8.1 tons) while Scotty was 8004 kg (8.8 tons) You can view this older study here Body mass estimation in non\u2010avian bipeds using a theoretical conversion to quadruped stylopodial proportions Sue and Scotty the most massive theropod specimens known to science by Thedinorocker on diviantart.  Tyrannosaurus rex size. So this makes Tyrannosaurus the overall largest theropod so far known. T.rex is currently heavier than the Spinosaurus that is estimated to weigh 6.9 to over 7. 6 tons A mathematical analysis on Spinosaurus mass. and weighs more than the most complete Giganotosaurus specimen we have that is estimated to weigh 6840 kgs so around 7.5 tons A mathematical analysis on Giganotosaurus mass. overall Tyrannosaurus was the more robust animal with a more stocky build and a larger more barrel-shaped torso with a heavier skull. Top view comparison of Spinosaurus (largest specimen) with Tyrannosaurus (Sue) and Carcharodontosaurus a close relative of Giganotosaurus by Nelson Bass-Howell  More up to date comparison Tyrannosaurus rex specimen Sue weighing around 8400 kg(9.2 tons) to 8830 kgs (9.7 tons) with the Giganotosaurus holotype weighing around 6840 kgs (7.5 tons)  This is a more up to date comparison of these huge predators and as you can see with the remains that we have they are both very similar in size. With Tyrannosaurus being estimated to be the heavier animal. Tyrannosaurus rex specimen Stan 11.7 meters long and around 8.5 tons with the Giganotosaurus holotype 7.5 tons and 12.2 to 12.4 meters long by Franoys  Tyrannosaurus rex specimen Sue 12.3 meters long and 9.2 to 9.7 tons with the Giganotosaurus holotype 12.2 to 12.4 meters long and 7.5 tons  So it seems that Giganotosaurus does rival Tyrannosaurus in size but is not as heavily built. Like previously stated the absolute maximum sizes for these animals are hard to estimate because we just can not go back in time and view a big population of these animals. We can only go from what limited fossil remains we have. While the Giganotosaurus holotype specimen is the best preserved and therefore the best example of the genus for study there is another more fragmentary specimen. This is where most of the bigger size estimates for this animal come from and is known as MUCP-V95. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40662857_New_specimen_of_Giganotosaurus_carolinii_Coria_Salgado_1995_supports_it_as_the_largest_theropod_ever_found This specimen has been used to obtain sizes of 12.5 to over 13.2 meters long and estimated to weigh at around 8200 kg (9 tons) but this is very uncertain because all this specimen consists of is an isolated jaw fragment. Jaws tend to vary in size and shape quite often when it comes to theropod Dinosaurs so yes this could be a bigger Giganotosaurus individual or it could be a smaller 11 to 12-meter long animal or an individual that is the same size as the holotype that has a big jaw. This is because every species we see variation either small variations or larger more significant variations. We can never really be sure until we find a decent amount of the skeleton this is a problem often faced in palaeontology. When MUCPV-95 was first described It was supposed to be around 8% larger than the jaw bone for the Giganotosaurus holotype because of the dentary being 8% longer but further study found this to be incorrect. This is because the dentary of the holotype is actually incomplete. While MUCPV-95 is complete not because the MUCPv-95 jaw fragment is actually larger its highly possible the individual the MUCPV-95 came from was really not larger than the holotype at all. Both dentaries bones have been measured previously in other studies and the difference between them is a tiny three millimetres that is nothing in the grand scheme of things. But even then it is estimated that even a 13-meter long Giganotosaurus would weigh slightly less than the bulkier 12.3-meter long Tyrannosaurus so T.rex has a weight advantage due to it being more robustly built. It would require a 14-meter long Giganotosaurus to outweigh a 12.35-meter Tyrannosaurus rex and so far there is no evidence that shows Giganotosaurus growing that long no large-bodied fully terrestrial theropod has ever reliably reached that length outside of estimates that usually end up being inaccurate. Yet sadly you will find plenty of places on the internet that falsely state they could definitely reach that size and people then spread the misinformation around the web. Giganotosaurus Mucpv-95 size estimate with the Giganotosaurus holotype with Tyrannosaurus rex specimen Sue by Scott Hartman  Tyrannosaurus rex specimen Sue with the Giganotosaurus holotype side and top views by Scott Hartman.  Quote from Scott Hartman regarding the size of Giganotosaurus and Tyrannosaurus rex \u201cAs near as I can tell, despite Tyrannosaurus and Giganotosaurus appearing similar in size in side view, there is little question that T. rex is actually the larger theropod based on known specimens. To be fair, there's only one good specimen of Giganotosaurus, and it took most of a century to find Sue, so it's certainly possible that as additional specimens are collected we will find larger southern giants. As always, please remember we don't have a statistically valid population of specimens from any of these large dinosaurs, so we are only comparing individuals, not species.\u201c Tyrannosaurus specimen Sue by Franoys  Giganotosaurus holotype specimen by Franoys  Because of its bulkier and robustly built body and heaver skull, Tyrannosaurus weighs more than Giganotosaurus despite both animals being a similar length. Diagrams by Scott Hartman  Aren't we supposed to be fighting? Giganotosaurus specimen MUCP-V95 estimated size (13.2 meters long and around 8 to 9 tons) with Tyrannosaurus specimen Sue (12.3 meters long and 9.2 to 9.7 tons)   Tyrannosaurus specimen Sue (black) with the Giganotosaurus holotype (grey)  When it comes to strength both of these animals were very large and very powerful both had huge skulls filled with large teeth and both would have caused serious damage to whatever animals they decided to hunt down. Both animals were well adapted for hunting down other dinosaurs Tyrannosaurus was better adapted for crushing and breaking bones while staying hung on to its prey items while Giganotosaurus was better at cutting and slicing the flesh of its chosen prey so both predators were very well adapted for killing and that is why both animals were apex predators. Tyrannosaurus had a wider heavier and more compact skull it is solid and has fused nasal bones this means it could bite very very hard. It is estimated that Tyrannosaurus had the most powerful bite of any land animal ever known. some estimations put its bite force at around 4 to 6 tons with other modern studies putting it even higher. T.rex also had larger neck muscles than Giganotosaurus and research has shown that the neck of Tyrannosaurus would have helped it yielding its large skull when it was feeding and attacking other animals.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261329604_The_role_of_the_neck_in_the_feeding_behaviour_of_the_Tyrannosauridae_Inference_based_on_kinematics_and_muscle_function_of_extant_avians . Tyrannosaurus rex also had unique teeth they were designed more like railroad spikes and were perfect for absorbing the huge stresses that a bite from a tyrannosaurus could create.Tyrannosaurus had a unique way of hunting down its unfortunate prey. Unlike the other large theropods because of how its teeth and skull were designed it killed its prey by clamping down on them very hard and then just kept hanging on. Its robust teeth resisted breaking while other theropods would use a bite and slash then retreat tactic they could not bite and stay hanging on for long periods as Tyrannosaurus could. All of this means Tyrannosaurus could bite and crush and tear apart other animals it could crush bones into dust most other carnivores avoid bones because they are tough and can damage their teeth Tyrannosaurus did not have this problem and this is backed up by science. (PDF) Craniocervical feeding dynamics of Tyrannosaurus rex Tyrannosaurus rex has a very heavy and robustly built skull it was designed to withstand huge bite pressure T.rex has the most powerful bite for a land animal A T. rex bite could have crushed a car. Here's how. Robert T. Bakker a well-known paleontologist and expert on Tyrannosaurus rex had this to say regarding Tyrannosaurus and its unique skull and teeth design along with contemporary Triceratops and its extreme adaptations \u201c Our recent studies of T. rex teeth indicate very unusual adaptations for piercing the armor of horned dinosaurs and ankylosaurs. Most dino-meat-eaters have a long row of sharp teeth, with a few gaps where an old tooth has been shed and a new crown is growing in. T. rex is different. Tooth crowns are immensely swollen and reinforced. Crown replacement patterns produce a snaggle-toothed pattern where single crowns are isolated, with no crown ahead or behind. Result: a rex bite is delivered by a few thick tooth crowns, not a long row of equally tall dental blades. The rex bite is unique among better-known dinosaurs. Instead of inflicting a long, shallow wound, rex jaws would thrust a few crowns deep into bone armor, killing a Triceratops with a single blow. We see close-linked co-evolution here, a terminal Cretaceous arms race. Triceratops is the commonest horned dino of the time, the final dinosaurian Age, the Lancian. T\u2019tops departs from the ceratopsian tradition of frill construction. Torosaurus, very rare during the Lancian Age of the Cretaceous, retains that basic design: the frill is composed of thin bone rods that make a frame, with huge holes in the middle. Triceratops fills in the holes with greatly thickened bone. Why would Triceratops invest in five times as much bone volume in its frill? Well\u2026to me the answer is obvious. Because the commonest predator has evolved great, armor-penetrating teeth. The argument goes in the other direction \u2013 T. rex evolved swollen, tall tooth crowns to deal with the unusual protection of the commonest horned herbivore. Rexian armor-penetrating teeth would also be useful in overcoming the ankylosaurians \u2013 Ankylosaurus itself is twice the body bulk of its ancestors in the American Cretaceous.\u201d - Dr. Robert T. Bakker. T.rex was well adapted for dispatching large armored prey while Giganotosaurus was not as well adapted for this. Tyrannosaurus rex jaws and neck muscles were far more robust than any carcharodontosaurid. Giganotosaurus included.  Tyrannosaurus teeth with the roots attached designed to puncture through armour and crush bones   If you want to read more information regarding the bite power of Tyrannosaurus rex please see this answer here David Moscato's answer to Can you put the bite strength of a Tyrannosaurus rex into perspective? Giganotosaurus did not have the same type of skull as Tyrannosaurus. It was large and with the higher size estimates is slightly longer than the skull of Tyrannosaurus. But not fused together and less heavily built and its teeth were more blade-like it had a huge mouth full of knifes and would not have been capable of creating the huge bite forces that Tyrannosaurus could create. Its skull and teeth design were better designed to create huge wounds in prey items slicing up flesh and creating a lot of blood loss for its prey item eventually the animal would die from the huge wounds created by Giganotosaurus. It is also theorized by some experts that because of the more blade-like teeth of Giganotosaurus it would have been more efficient at hunting down Sauropods. Giganotosaurus had a lighter less robustly built skull than Tyrannosaurus rex so it could not bite as hard or stay gripped onto its prey items for sustained periods like Tyrannosaurs could. Its teeth were well designed to cut flesh and would have cut and sliced open the flesh of its prey items it was more effective at causing its prey to bleed out compared to Tyrannosaurus. Very deadly  Giganotosaurus tooth perfect for ripping and cutting the flesh of other animals  Giganotosaurus would have used its knife-like teeth to create huge wounds in its prey such as young sauropod dinosaurs.   Both hunting styles would have been very effective for dispatching prey and both of them would have been very deadly and effective tools when it comes to this conflict. Theropod dinosaurs seem to have had many instances of inter-species conflicts, for example, we have many Tyrannosaurus specimens that show evidence of face biting. So it's pretty safe to assume that Tyrannosaurus would have been trying to bite the face of its mighty rival and in my opinion, the Tyrannosaurus\u2019 bite would have been more damaging here. The Giganotosaurus cannot deliver the bite force that is necessary to damage or even crush the skull of a T. rex while the T.rex had a 4 to 6-ton bite force and could easily crush the other theropod\u2019s skull or crush and rip off its rivals jaw. Just imagine if the bone used in this video was the snout or the skull of a Giganotosaurus.  Tyrannosaurus had a bite so powerful it could crush a modern day car with little problem.  Giganotosaurus just could not do the same thing it did not have the skull and jaw or teeth design for gripping onto an animal then crushing bones. This does not mean its bite was not deadly however it was just adapted for killing in a different way to Tyrannosaurus. Mechanical Dinosaur Jaws Vs. Replica Borealopelta Body  This clip shows the possible biting power for Acrocanthosaurus a large theropod and member of the same family as Giganotosaurus. It is pretty safe to assume that Giganotosaurus had a bite that was as deadly as what is shown here in this clip. Acrocanthosaurus by Franoys  When it comes to speed many people like to state that Giganotosaurus would be faster than Tyrannosaurus this is also hard to prove because we simply can not watch these animals live there lives we can not view them walking running or hunting so we can only make educated guesses. Recent studies seem to suggest that Tyrannosaurus and members of its family might be the most agile theropods https://www.researchgate.net/pub...Tyrannosaurus and members of its family seem to have legs better suited for running and it seems that it could make faster turns than other theropods. With both of these animals being very massive I do not think there was a huge difference in speed or agility but more studies are needed here to clear it up. Speed estimates for various non-avian Dinosaurs Giganotosaurus and Tyrannosaurus included by Randomdinos on Diviantart Some non-avian dinosaur speed estimates  Many palaeontologists have looked at this fight there have been documentaries done of this subject one was made in the 90s called Beyond T. Rex. with many experts stating that Tyrannosaurus would have the advantage in a conflict. I believe these huge carnivores were just as powerful as each other and it would be a bloody and messy close fight but Tyrannosaurus definitely has the more powerful bite and was better adapted for staying hung on to animals while ripping and tearing and crushing its prey items. Giganotosaurus was not as well designed for this. Tyrannosaurus could end this encounter instantly by clamping down on the neck of its rival crushing it. So that is why If somehow some way we could bring these animals together I believe it would be 50/50 or 60/50 in favour of Tyrannosaurus. T.rex has a weight advantage and is the overall more robust animal with the much stronger bite with more robust jaw and neck muscles. Tyrannosaurus also has a more sophisticated brain than Giganotosaurus. So overall I would give the advantage to Tyrannosaurus rex but if the Giganotosaurus that is involved in this encounter was over 13 meters long and weighed 8 to over 9 tons it would be a much closer fight because the Tyrant lizard would not be throwing its rival around as easy but like I previously stated it is very uncertain if Giganotosaurus could actually grow to 13 meters long. We really need more fossil evidence when it comes to the animal we really need more fossil evidence for all Dinosaurs. Conflicts like this could go either way really just like animal conflicts today it's never a sure thing. If both animals in this conflict were at equal size and weight then it really is who ever gets the first deadly bite in. The Giganotosaurus could cause some serious damage with its slashing and slicing bite and could end the fight with one decent bite to the Tyrannosaurus it could easily slit open the throat of the Tyrant King. But the Tyrannosaurus is the more robust wider and heavier built animal armed with a 4 to 5 maybe 6-ton bite force if the Giganotosaurus ends up stuck in that vice-like grip and it can not escape its lights out. Thank you for taking the time to read my answer. Once again i will state that if you want to do your own research into these kind of topics about these animals I recommend you look at the studies and the work done by experts and palaeontologists and not just go looking on platforms such as Youtube the people making content on there most of the time do not use up to date information or are just highly inaccurate.

            "answer_text": "An interesting fight between the tyrant lizard king vs the tyrant of South America. This would be an interesting battle. Both dinosaurs are somewhat similar in design but they aren\u2019t closely related in fact, T.rex was more closet related to a chicken than a Giganotosaurus. But who would win? Let\u2019s find out, starting with Giganotosaurus.  Giganotosaurus was a large Carcharodontosaur from South America. It was also the largest of the family, barely surpassing Carcharodontosaurus in size. This beast lived in Argentina from 98\u201397 MYA. One of the largest theropods of all time, measuring 13 meters, standing 4 meters tall and weighing around 7 tonnes. Although it was mainly believe to hunt Argentinosaurus, the truth is it didn\u2019t hunt them. Giganotosaurus was the top predator of it\u2019s environment and did likely hunted in groups, not only to take down large prey but to also take care of their young most likely. Size would\u2019ve helped it steal kills from Ekrixinatosaurus as well. Having one of the largest skulls of any land carnivore, Giganotosaurus has a powerful bite, though not as powerful as Tyrannosaurus rex. Who we are going over, now.  Tyrannosaurus rex, the tyrant lizard king. This guy is very iconic, for one thing, it\u2019s tiny arms. However, those arms were very powerful and can easily lift a human. Tyrannosaurus rex was one of the most advanced dinosaurs to ever live. Both competitors are highly advanced theropod dinosaurs though. Being the most massive land carnivore discovered, it weighed 9+ tonnes and measured up to 13 meters. However, could they get bigger, yes they can. Unlike Giganotosaurus, it hunted more armored prey. But hold up, we have recent evidence to prove that they even coexisted with a Titanosaur. An Argentinosaurus sized Titanosaur, Alamosaurus, also my favorite sauropod. T.rexes were actually pretty agile for their size, in fact, Tyrannosaurs were the most agile theropods, so far. You think Giganotosaurus hunted larger prey? Well your wrong there, the sauropods Giganotosaurus only weighed 7 tonnes. Smaller than both a Rex, a Triceratops, an Alamosaurus, and a Edmontosaurus. Oh, have I mention that these guys were also cannibals? Having some of the largest brains of the non avian dinosaurs. Let\u2019s see a comparisons:  When people often say this, they call T.rex THICC! Well their right, Tyrannosaurus rex was far more robust and was smarter as well. Here\u2019s a rather strange example, Turf\u2019s Love Rex:  This Rex measured 40 feet long, but the strange part it is, it was only 15 years old when it died. If full adulthood, it would\u2019ve been the size of Scotty maybe even bigger. Now who would win? Personally, Tyrannosaurus rex would win 65% of the time. Why? Well it was smarter, more agile, had a more powerful bite, larger, more robust, etc. I think Tyrannosaurus rex severely outmatches Giganotosaurus. I can\u2019t think of any theropod being able to take down T.rex most of the time other than Zhuchengtyrannus. Now the main question is, who\u2019s the deadliest predator. Well in my opinion, T.rex. It was far smarter than any other Megatheropod found so far. It was also the most advanced. Giganotosaurus was an advanced theropod but no Megatheropod was as advanced as the Tyrannosaurs. ",
