            "answer_text": "That is impossible to say really, it would vary very much according to class and wealth. For poor people living in towns, small terraced houses were the norm \u2018two up, two down\u2019 as they were known (two rooms downstairs and two up). They were not built with bathrooms, for most working people, a bath once a week in a tin tub in front of the kitchen fire was the norm. The toilet would be outside, and often a row of houses might have to share one. Houses were often shared too by the very poor, a family might have only one room to live in (lots of these houses still exist, though nowadays they have bathrooms built on in extensions). The better off had bigger houses, and the better off you were the larger the house, since you would accommodate not only your family but a number of servants (three was the usual number for a comfortably off upper middle class family, and for the very well off it might be many more than that). The servants\u2019 rooms were usually in the attic. ",
