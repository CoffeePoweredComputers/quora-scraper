            "answer_text": "Electricity is not light. However, electricity is closely related to light. Electromagnetism has two constituents: charges and the electromagnetic field. A charge creates an electromagnetic field. A static charge just creates, well, an electrostatic field. A moving charge also creates a magnetic field. When there is a stream of moving charges, we call it an electric current. A stream of moving charges in a wire: that\u2019s the everyday phenomenon of electricity. A charge that accelerates (e.g., moves back-and-forth, such that the magnitude and direction of its velocity keeps changing all the time) creates a changing electromagnetic field. These changes can then propagate in the field over great distances. Far from charges, these propagating changes in the electromagnetic field take the form of waves, called (unsurprisingly) electromagnetic waves. The most important property of these electromagnetic waves is their frequency: the number of times the field \u201cwaves\u201d in a second. Low frequency electromagnetic waves are radio waves. Beyond radio waves, there is infrared light (which we usually perceive as radiated heat), then visible light, then ultraviolet light, X-rays and gamma rays. The visible light part of this electromagnetic spectrum is very small, actually; most electromagnetic waves are invisible to us, and we don\u2019t sense them in any way unless they are powerful enough to be perceived as heat. Electricity can produce light in many different ways. Traditional light bulbs use electricity to heat a wire. The wire gets hot because the charged particles of the current keep bouncing into the atoms and electrons of the wire, making them vibrate. These vibrating atoms and electrons, themselves charged particles, then emit electromagnetic waves as they wiggle back-and-forth: the wire filament in the incandescent bulb starts emitting light. There are more complicated (but more efficient) ways to produce light, relying on atomic physics. For instance, in an LED light source, the current transfers energy to electrons around atoms of a semiconductor. When these electrons fall back to their lowest energy ground state, a unit of light is emitted. Because this method does not involve heat, it is fundamentally less wasteful, more efficient than the incandescent way to produce light.  I thank my generous supporters on Patreon.

            "answer_text": "How is electricity light? Because electricity is usually conduction current, which is usually the flow of electrons, and we can make electrons (and positrons) out of light in gamma-gamma pair production. Then you can reverse the process in electron-positron annihilation:  As to how this actually works, various authors have suggested that the electron is a self-trapped 511keV photon in a spin \u00bd double loop \u201ctrivial knot\u201d configuration. See for example John Williamson and Martin van der Mark\u2019s 1996 paper Is the electron a photon with toroidal topology? and Qiu-Hong Hu\u2019s 2005 paper The nature of the electron:  Images by John Williamson and Martin van der Mark and by Qiu-Hong Hu. Another way that electricity is light is when it\u2019s displacement current. Take a look at the 2010 physicsworld article taming light at the nanoscale. That\u2019s where Nader Engheta talks about optical computing:  Fair use excerpt from taming light at the nanoscale Light is alternating displacement current, and is more fundamental than conduction current. This displacement current is a real displacement, which is why Maxwell said light consists of transverse undulations. Hence in gamma-gamma pair production light displaces its own path into a closed path. See my article on how pair production works for details. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you mean 'How does electricity turn into light?' Electricity moves through the circuit to a light bulb, where the lower resistance of the filament causes it to glow bright and hot as the current passes through it back to the source. Light bulb filaments are a metal specially chosen for it's stability when exposed to extreme heat(Not sure exactly what metal it is made of). Modern filaments are also chosen by the wavelength of light they emit. Common household incandescent bulbs emit a wavelength similar to that of our own sun, which is the most healthy for our eyes. You may notice that the filaments are substantially thinner than the wires in the rest of the circuit. This is because the resistance of any material is dependent not only on it's molecular structure, but also by how much mass it contains. By making an object thinner, you effectively decrease it's resistance. ",

When electrons flow in one direction, its anti particles flow in its opposite direction; and , that is the conventional current, which we call \u2018current\u2019 in practical life. Current only one quantitatively. Current is constituted by valence electrons mainly in major quantity. For a flow, respective pressure in flow direction is required. In electric current the electric pressure is the Voltage. How voltage is developed? concentration of electrical particles, the electron and positrons at their respective, opposite to each other points; strengthens the electric field between these two points, generating the electric current flow. The electric field of moving electrons react with orbiting electrons in a conductor generating light waves. Electricity is not light; but, it generates light. ",
