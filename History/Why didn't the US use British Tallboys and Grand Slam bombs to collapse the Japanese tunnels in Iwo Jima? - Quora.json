            "answer_text": "I will let you in on a little known secret about militaries around the world: they do not consider anything that any other military does as being \u201cgood enough\u201d to copy much less employ in warfare. If someone else thinks of it no one military (or in the case of the U.S. military) will bother with it because no one can take credit for it. Perfect late to current example: the Army, the Marines, the Navy and the Air Force ALL have different camo uniforms. Not just different but completely unalike. Does anyone actually believe that the Navy\u2019s camo uniform will make the wearers less visible while skulking around on an aircraft carrier? So back to the TallBoy and the Grand Slam bombs designed, developed and produced by the British. The reason that they were not used, besides the obvious one of availability in the Pacific Theater and at Iwo Jima, was that the damn things weighed so much (12,000 and 22,000 lbs respectively) that even the British could only deliver the things one at a time from only one type of aircraft that could carry it. When you add to that the fact that Army Air Corps bombers out of the Marianas (hundreds of miles away) were actually used to bomb Iwo Jima for two reason, i.e. nearest airfield was too far away and the U.S. wanted Iwo for its airfield alone as a refueling station to bomb the Japanese mainland, and my favorite reason, because prior to the landings the U.S. Navy bombarded the island for THREE DAYS rather than the 10 days that the U.S. Marines had requested. Of course, NO ONE on the American side knew what Japanese General Kuribayashi had done to fortify and connect the island by tunnels. After three days (delayed also by bad weather intermittently) the Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet (CinCPac) and Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas (CinCPOA), commanding Allied air, land, and sea forces during World War II commented prior to the landings, \"Well, this will be easy. The Japanese will surrender Iwo Jima without a fight.\" \u2013 Chester W. Nimitz. Famous last words that probably haunted him forever. So with all of this going against the use of the TallBoys and the Grand Slams not sure that they would have made much difference if they had been used. ",

            "answer_text": "There are, I suspect, any number of reasons. These were big bombs and the Americans did not have an aircraft with a bomb bay capable of carrying them. Even the Avro Lancaster, which had a very large bomb bay, had to be modified to carry the two weapons you have mentioned. The British didn\u2019t have a lot of these bombs to use. By the end of the war, the Tall Boys had been used on 35 missions between June 1944 and April of 1945. These did involve multiple aircraft, and there were more Tall Boys Available than Grand Slams. The Grand Slam was not available until March of 1945, after the battle for Iwo Jima had begun, and was used operationally only 42 times. That is 42 individual bombs\u2026not 42 missions involving multiple bombers. The Americans were working on their own version of the Tall Boy, the T-10, using American components, but they were not ready prior to the end of the war. Development was completed and they were used during the Korean war against railway bridges and reservoir dams. After the B-36 was retired the USAF didn\u2019t have an airplane that could carry the bombs. They were used in Vietnam. The tail sections were removed and the warheads were incorporated in the BLU-82 \u201cDaisy Cutter\u201d which was pushed out the back of a C-130. In addition, the USAF experimented with the Grand Slam, post-war, using B-29s which had been modified to carry the bomb but, as you can see, it didn\u2019t fit entirely internally.   You can find more photos here\u2026Bombs The Americans actually had the same problem with their atomic weapons, which were relatively large but still smaller than both the Tall Boy and Grand Slam weapons, and briefly considered using Avro Lancasters to carry them. Ultimately the decision was that it was easier to modify the B-29 to carry the atomic weapons rather than learning how to operate and maintain a new type. ",
