            "answer_text": "These answers seem to ignore the fact that countries like France, Germany, and the United States would be able to detect an invading force travelling to places like Luxembourg or Leichtenstein days in advance. It's not like Italy would just let any old country fly warplanes over their homeland without a pre-approved mission. Thus, I suggest Nauru as the easiest country to invade (and hold for a reasonable length of time). With a population of 10,000, a determined military could disguise soldiers in a civilian ship while preventing communications from leaving the island by sabotaging the island\u2019s power supply. If everything was planned out to the smallest of details, a skilled unit could seize control of the island without any other nation learning. It's far harder to do so now with the omni-presence of smartphones, but there must be some way to pull it off. Unlike in Luxembourg, people can't run away and escape to strong neighboring countries. Nauru\u2019s closest neighbor is 186 miles away. Cone to think of it, when\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve ever heard from Nauru? Maybe it's under foreign occupation right now. Nauru - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Bulgaria. Yeah, quite sad that I have to say my own country is the easiest to invade\u2026 but it\u2019s true. Once Bulgaria was the largest and most powerful country around, now it has 34000 soldiers with ~200 000 in reserve, except that those \u2018\u2019soldiers\u2019\u2019 don\u2019t even recieve training, most of them just go, enlist and go back home\u2026 Bulgaria has no large amount of resources whatsoever. Yeah, tanks do not run on rose oil. Its population is constantly shrinking, being ~6 million people at the moment, and there are smaller (in size and area) countries that have more population than that. It has about 150 un-upgraded T-72 tanks that are inferior should they have to fight even a post-ww2 era tank such as the M48 Patton because those tanks are the worse Soviet export versions. Out of those 150 tanks absolutely nobody knows how many are in condition to work. As a NATO member, Bulgaria should expect help if anything hostile appears at our doorstep, but I don\u2019t think NATO would care for some small country over there in Eastern Europe. 34000 soldiers and 150 tanks sounds impressive for a country this size and population, but it\u2019s a paper tiger, 34000 untrained soldiers who probably only know how to aim, fire a gun, clean and reload, and 150 tanks of which n work, and probably only partially, and even then older tanks could easily crush them because they are slow for a modern tank, they have no armor basically, and because probably nobody has any idea how to work with them.
