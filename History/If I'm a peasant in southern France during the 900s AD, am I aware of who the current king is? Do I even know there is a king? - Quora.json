AFAIR, such a peasant would not even be the subject of a \u201cKing of France\u201d. He will care more about who\u2019s the local ruler, duke, count or baron, because whatever guy rules in Paris, he definitely cannot influence the south more like said local ruler. And of course he would be much more interested about what happens on the other side of the Pyrenees (Moors, Arab kingdoms) and perhaps Italy (as a region, bot a state). ",
