Then the 12 adityas, 11 Rudras, 8 Vasus and 2 Ashwins were the most important (these 33 'gods' and all their descendants together were called as the 330,000 gods or 33,000,000 gods or 3,300,000 gods). The most important of the Adityas was one named Vishnu, of all Rudras, was the one named Shiva and of all Vasus, was the one named 'Agni'. Brihaspati and Sukrachaarya were most important with the rise of Indra among these 33 gods.

Then, Prahalada was most important, after whom was Bali. Vaivaswata Manu was the most important after that, followed by Bharata, followed by Prithu, followed by Harischandra. Sagara was the most important human after that, followed by Dileepa. Bhageeratha was the most important human thereafter, followed by Ambareesha.

Followed by Bharata (different than one mentioned above) who was most important after that. During this time Vyasa rose who then also became most important. Bheeshma was the most important after that. And he was followed by Yudhistra and Bheema and Arjuna. Pareekshit was most important after that followed by Janameyjaya.
