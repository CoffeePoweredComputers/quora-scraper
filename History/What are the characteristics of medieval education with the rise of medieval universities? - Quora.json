            "answer_text": "What are the characteristics of Medieval education with the rise of Medieval universities? A significant characteristic of a Medieval education was that it was in Latin. Latin was the universal language of instruction, diplomacy, and literature. If you didn\u2019t speak Latin and wanted an education, you learned the language as quickly as possible.  A rare peasant boy (girls were rarely educated) who showed promise might be tutored by his priest; otherwise, he received no education in Latin. A second characteristic was the narrow curriculum. Unlike 21st Century universities, Universities offered only seven subjects: logic (thinking skills), Latin grammar, astronomy, geometry, rhetoric (how to write or speak to persuade), arithmetic, and music theory. These seven were divided into the trivium and quadrivium. The easiest subjects were taught first: logic, grammar, and rhetoric. If you passed these, you continued into the quadrivium\u2014the remaining four subjects: advanced math, music, geometry, and astronomy. Eventually, universities added physics, moral philosophy, and metaphysics (cause and effect and defining the nature of things).  The third characteristic of the Medieval university is that they had no physical site. Instructors taught wherever they could beg, borrow, or rent a room. Students also boarded as best as they could afford. Over time, instructors attracted patrons, Nobility and wealthy merchants, and the university as we know it today began to form. It bought, rented, or built buildings specifically for instruction or housing.  Cambridge about 1575 A final characteristic of Medieval universities was the mobility of the instructors. An excellent instructor, the students liked, was often hotly courted by different institutions because when he moved, his students followed him. This brought revenue to the school. Memoria Press ",
