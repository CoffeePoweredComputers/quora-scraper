            "answer_text": "Besides nationalism, it was obvious that the central planning system of the Soviet Union was incapable to ensure production of fast moving consumer goods. In the end, the problems appeared even with some food, like sugar. Or toilet paper. Secondly, Soviet industry and military presence were also harmful to the nature, the army behaved not like caring hosts. Also, even if the Baltic people gladly helped in cases like Armenian or Tashkent earthquakes, their young conscripts were involved in needless dyedovchina and other threats for conscripts. They were also sent to Afghanistan. The older generation was sent to Chernobyl. Thirdly all this restrictions for going abroad, like even no border crossing point with Poland until 80s, was humilating. Finally, all restriction of religion / faith in atheistic USSR was always stressed, too. ",

            "answer_text": "Because they\u2019d been independent before the Second World War, and found that they quite liked the experience. That\u2019s roughly the simple answer. Moreover, particularly in Latvia and Estonia (less so in Lithuania, where the demographics were different), there was a strong sense that the indigenous nationality was on the verge of being obliterated through Russification. Large numbers of Russians moving into the countries will do that, after all. ",
