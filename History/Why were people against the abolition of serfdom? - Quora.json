            "answer_text": " Wat Tyler's Revolt of 1381 was seen as one of the consequences of the Black Plague which began in 1347. Along with lower taxes, abolition of courts of law & the dismissal of certain government officials, one of the rebels\u2019 demands was to end serfdom. The authorities brutally cracked down on the unrest. But the aristocrats saw the writing on the wall & quickly turned to sheep raising & exporting the wool for cash. So the serfs turned into tenant farmers. Who were later evicted during the Enclosures in England & the Highland Clearances in Scotland. Then they settled in urban ghettos where they abused gin & crime rates rose. Which led to convict transportations, first to America & then to Australia.

            "answer_text": "Serfdom was harsh for common people but had its advantages too. Serfs were the responsibility of their Lords. Unlike a industrialist who has a right to fire and hire workers, Lords didn't have right to fire their subjects, because that would lead to social chaos. In bad times, a Lord had to take care of his serfs or at least keep them under control. Having a Lord was similar to social security for common people. ",
