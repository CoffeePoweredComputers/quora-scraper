            "answer_text": " All behind you, Winston This cartoon, drawn by Low during World War II, shows Churchill and alongside him Clement Attlee, Ernest Bevin and Herbert Morrison. Immediately behind Churchill is the unmistakable figure of Neville Chamberlain. Attlee, Bevin and Morrison were from the Labour Party - in peace-time, they and Churchill were on the opposite side. Chamberlain was from the same party as Churchill, but of course Churchill had strongly opposed Chamberlain\u2019s policy of appeasement, which had disastrous results. The point of the image is clear: it was a time of national emergency, and thus a time to set aside the usual political differences and focus on the one important task - defeating Hitler. Standing behind Churchill did not mean approving of Churchill\u2019s whole political agenda, it meant standing behind the man who had been chosen to lead the nation through this crisis. Churchill did not engage Hitler in single combat. The Axis was defeated not by an individual, but by a whole generation. When people celebrate Churchill\u2019s speeches, we are not just celebrating one man\u2019s rhetorical skills, we are celebrating speeches that gave expression to the determination and courage of the nation that listened to those speeches, and put into practice the virtues that Churchill was preaching. This is why, when we celebrate Churchill\u2019s wartime leadership, we are celebrating the achievement of a generation. The fact that Churchill was a heroic leader during the war should not lead to an attitude of blind adoration. Even as the war was raging, there were many people who acknowledged that Winston was a good leader - for as long as the war lasted. There were many people who were aware that he had a flawed vision of the world - this is why, at the end of the war, he lost an election to Clement Attlee. Gratitude for Churchill\u2019s wartime leadership should not mean that we have to deny the fact that he was an imperialist, and our celebration of his achievements should not become a celebration of imperialism. But I think the converse also holds - his failings in other contexts should not stop us from celebrating his role in the Second World War. (Thanks to John Brown for pointing out that at one point, I wrote \u201cAttlee\u201d when I meant \u201cChamberlain\u201d, and to Alistair Shaw for pointing out my confusion between Aneurin Bevan and Ernest Bevin.)

            "answer_text": "During the Arcadia conference in 1942 and in line with the subsequent Rainbow 5 agreement in order to continue receiving US Lend-Lease Aid with a specific emphasis upon seven destroyers earmarked for the British Atlantic Fleet Roosevelt insisted and Churchill capitulated that Britain realign her trade preferences away from the Commonwealth nations to favour the United States. This ultimately caused the collapse of the British Empire and set VERY young nations such as Australia and New Zealand prematurely adrift and would over the course of the following decades redefine their social, economic and political landscapes. The redeeming quality of Roosevelt was that he was an elected US president and never pretended to be in it for anything other than American interests and at that particular time in history, the United States owed nothing to any of those nations.He wore his heart on his sleeve in this regard and his position was clear. Churchill, on the other hand, was a different kettle of fish. In return, as part of the agreement, Churchill insisted that American forces remain in Europe until such time as Germany was defeated, sidelining the Pacific theater and insisting that should it be necessary the Eastern Pacific be sacrificed. This included Australia and New Zealand through very pointedly nobody EVER mentioned this to the ANZACS. In order to keep Australian and New Zealand forces in North Africa and Southern Europe as long as possible as they watched, dismayed as the Japanese massed an invasion force on their northern border, Churchill continued to pacify the Australians with assurances that Britain (and America) would funnel assets into Australia's defense at the last moment. This kept them nervously fighting in the North African and European theaters until finally under imminent threat and against Churchill's demands they had no choice but to recall their troops to face the Japanese. This is why despite being everywhere throughout both World wars ANZAC forces were not present for the actual D Day landings. Meanwhile, Australian forces, still with the dust on them from North Africa and Greece returned to the Pacific and were forced to hold back the full might of the Japanese invasion force alone and unaided in the mountains of New Guinea for almost two years while they waited for American (and other ANZAC) forces to Island hop across the Western Pacific and reinforce them. It was a particularly sinister and dire episode of the Pacific war and despite Australia's loyalty and MASSIVE sacrifices for Britain from the outset of the Boer War and BOTH World wars, British assistance never arrived. This is the reason why Australians, while always extremely close and loyal to the British people almost to a man absolutely despise Churchill to this day. So who was the Villian? On one hand, Roosevelt was the architect of the collapse of the Commonwealth which set the young burgeoning nations of Australia and New Zealand prematurely adrift, caused them innumerable hardships and totally redefined their political and social landscapes. On the other, he was never anything but open about his motivations and of course, at the end of the day it was the Americans that come to Australia\u2019s aid. Churchill, on the other hand, has to take responsibility for his capitulation to Roosevelt\u2019s demands and despite Australia and New Zealand's long history of sacrificing for British interests, intentionally kept them in the dark, repeatedly outright lying to them by promising support which he never intended to deliver and was SECRETLY prepared not only to sacrifice them but from his perspective actually did so because he never did send those reinforcements. Certainly THE single most notable betrayal in modern human history and given Churchills, capitulation cost Britain their reputation, their wealth, their preeminence as a world power and their Commonwealth I am surprised more British people don\u2019t despise him as fervently as Australians do. So why did the UK decline after World War two?Churchill. Sure we won the war but that's not to say somebody else, making different decisions wouldn\u2019t have either.Even if it did come at a greater cost. I mean what was it we were fighting for anyway?Our way of life? Churchill not only completely failed in that PRIME objective but did so callously and dishonestly and I\u2019ll tell you one thing - while Australians love and admire their British brothers and sisters and have never held the British broadly responsible it will be centuries before we fully trust a British politician again. Lastly, if you think I am anti-British you should read my answer to: Reese Mac's answer to Why are the British so well respected in the world? (amongst MANY others) I am not anti-British.Sincerely - I both love and admire my British brothers and sisters - as I do Americans (I'm married to one).I am very specifically anti-Churchill, (the man) and to a lesser extent not particularly fond of Roosevelt.You will also find almost ALL multi-generational Anglo Australians agree with me.We\u2019re raised on it and Churchill's betrayal is as much a part of our narrative as Kangaroos and wombats.
