            "answer_text": "No it wasn't a hoax. In fact their were other smaller massacres as well. The S.S. killed American POWS and Belgian civilians. The S.S. units under the command of Joachim Peiper carried out most of them. Peiper said he never ordered his men to do that. Of course he was probably lying because they thought they were going to win. Or realized they were going to lose so why not kill some of the enemy and civilians. You know get our jollies on. After the war Peiper was tried but acquitted. A few other S.S. officers and soldiers were tried and sentenced to prison. Peiper was later murdered in France when his house was set on fire. They found his remains the next day. ",
