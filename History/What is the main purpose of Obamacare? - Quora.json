            "answer_text": "America was faced with a persistent problem: people were going bankrupt, or very close to it, due to medical expenses. There were countless stories of people getting into an accident, or getting a bad disease or developing some infirmity. They would go to the doctor and soon start receiving many large medical bills. $5000 for this, $7000 for that, $300 for a test (one of ten they have to take), $1000 per night in a hospital room, etc. etc. Totals quickly reach 60K or 100K or 200K. Most Americans don\u2019t have that kind of money. Their life savings are drained and they still have over 30K to pay. People cried out for help. For decades the politicians largely ignored those cries. Sometimes there would be bill to limit this or that expense, but it was never enough. Mandatory health insurance was the answer. Just like mandatory car insurance. Mitt Romney made the first move by instituting MassHealth (aka \u201cRomneycare\u201d) in Massachusetts. It was a success and the Republicans loved it since it forced people to get insurance which meant bigger profits for the always-profitable insurance industry, one of the biggest in America. Obama saw the success of MassHealth and he wanted to duplicate that across America. He wanted to help average Americans afford medical care without going bankrupt. He ran for President in 2008 touting his idea. He won. His team of writers and lawyers went to work adapting Romneycare for the entire nation. Republicans did an immediate about-face and started hating the new version of Romneycare: Obamacare. One suspects it isn\u2019t the plan that they hate, but the President who proposed it. (We can only guess the response if John McCain had won in 2008 and decided to tackle the issue.) Since Republicans want to repeal Obamacare (and they have nothing to replace it with, haven\u2019t even thought about it) this would mean they want to return to an America where bankruptcies caused by medical problems are common. This is further evidence they have no interest in helping average people, only the top 1% oligarchs matter. ",

            "answer_text": "The purpose of Obamacare is to make it affordable for individuals to purchase health insurance. Over time America's health care system evolved to where your employer determined the quality of your health insurance. Employers liked it because it helped them retain good employees. Employees are then less likely to leave a job that offers good insurance. However there was no law that employers had to offer health insurance. If you had a job that doesn't offer health insurance or are out of the work force you had to find an individual policy. Individual policies are very expensive and prior to Obamacare did not accept patients with pre-existing conditions. This meant that about 40-50 million Americans were uninsured. Obamacare or the ACA banned insurance companies from excluding people with pre-existing conditions, eliminated lifetime caps, allowed children to stay on their parents policies to the age of 26, subsidized the insurance premiums for lower income families and expanded Medicare coverage. In exchange for these benefits the ACA also imposed an individual mandate that penalizes people that do not purchase insurance. Republicans who virulently oppose the ACA fail to mention that it was modeled after their own plan. ",
