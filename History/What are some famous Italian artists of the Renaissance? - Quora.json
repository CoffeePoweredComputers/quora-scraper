Although the spirit of humanism prevailed the subject matter of the most of the Renaissance art was Christian. Renaissance art bloomed most profusely in Italy. I can name three artists who are famous and are held in high esteem by me : Raphael : ( Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino) 1483  Self portrait of Raphael - 1506 He achieved a rare blending of devotional feeling with a sense of beauty. Although He died at 37, he produced a great no.of paintings of which the most familiar is the Madonna.  List of works by Raphael - Wikipedia 2. Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni 1475  An Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance born in the Republic of Florence and patronized by the Medici family. Later he went to Rome.

Born in Florence , patronized by the Duke of Milan. \"Many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the \"Universal Genius\" or \"Renaissance Man\", an individual of \"unquenchable curiosity\" and \"feverishly inventive imagination\"\" or \"Renaissance Man\". Leonardo was, and is, renowned primarily as a painter. Among his works, the Mona Lisa is the most famous and most parodied portrait and The Last Supper the most reproduced religious painting of all time. Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon, being reproduced on items as varied as the euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts. Perhaps fifteen of his paintings have survived. Nevertheless, these few works, together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting, compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivaled only by that of his contemporary, Michelangelo. The last supper - 1495  The venetian school is an excellent example of the secularization of the Renaissance art . Artistic expression in Venice was worldly and materialistic. Titian : Tiziano Vecelli 1490 Recognized by his contemporaries as \"The Sun Amidst Small Stars\"  Tintoretto - 1519 was an Italian painter and a notable exponent of the Renaissance school.  trained for a short period by Titian and was a great admirer of Michelangelo, copying his drawings. Tinto\u2019s \"Miracle of the Slave\".  ",
