            "answer_text": "Gladiators weren\u2019t vegetarian. They ate meat every once in a while. A gladiator was a huge investment. Just like a modern racing horse. You invest a lot of money into a horse, its diet and training to make more money. Depending on century and gladiators type 2\u201320 percent of gladiators died at a fight. Even some free poor Romans were enrolled to be a gladiator because of regular food. And even then, these Romans needed the approval of magistrate. This indicates that being a gladiator wasn\u2019t that bad. The idea of gladiators being expandable slaves was not practiced as it portrayed to us. Roman law allowed slaves to gain their freedom at certain conditions. Some former slaves like Diocletian later became emperors. And gladiators were the most prestigious slaves. Gladiators\u2019 and gladiatrices\u2019 diets were carbohydrate based because they needed a layer of fat to protect their muscles from small cuts. This is one of the reasons of gladiators having a small death rate. Gladiators were regularly served barley because Romans believed it was strengthened the body. Cheapness of barley maybe a factor, but not a prominent one. Considering Roman Empire arranged daily meals for poor plebs, in Rome food was a luxury and Gladiators were served not the best but optimal food for their profession. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, most people in Rome ate very little meat. Roman diet was based on bread and vegetables, most proteins were provided by pulses, dairy, eggs, some fish, and the occasional meat. So, quite obviously that\u2019s what gladiators ate too. But there is more. When we think of gladiators we often think of something like this:  Or like this:  But gladiators competed in a sport where they played with sharp blades wearing almost no armor. Still their trainers didn\u2019t usually feel like wasting a perfectly good gladiator be having him rapidly killed, after months of training. So they preferred to protect their gladiators with something the fighter could wear regardless of armor: fat!  One of the few not cringeworthy things of Gladiator by Ridley Scott was the choice of Russel Crowe as main character. Now, our good Russel was never a slim man and, although he had probably lost weight for the film, he still didn\u2019t have the superdefined muscles that are so popular now. He retained a bit of fat to cover them up (not enough, but not far from being realistic) and protect them from shallow cuts. One good reason why gladiators ate lots of bread and beans is that they needed some fat layer to protect themselves. ",
