            "answer_text": "I personally think that Sumerian translations are in question. As far as I know they depend on cross-translations with Akkadian. It is in question whether Akkadians were fully capable of interpreting Sumerian though. Sumerian language was far more powerful than Akkadian, which was not based on cuneiform originally. Thus, any translation existing now is actually a crude interpretation, away from a dependable translation. Yet another cuneiform based language is of Hittites, which is in far more mystery than Sumerian. Again as far as I know cuneiform based languages we know tend to be agglutinative languages. Therefore, someone with information on agglutivative (at least knowing one language strictly agglutinative) will have more advantage translating a cuneiform based language. I think, someone knowing only the western languages, or even an automated approach based only on western rules, will fail. ",
