            "answer_text": "Why do Hungarians call Romanians \"Ol\u00e1h\"? This is coming from a Romanian perspective. Firstly, today \u201cOl\u00e1h\u201d is perceived by Romanians as an offence (not really a slur, but not far from it), especially if coming from a Hungarian. It is also safe to say that the Hungarians that would use it, are not doing it for the sake of sounding edgy/cool by using and old denomination \u2026 Secondly, Ol\u00e1h most likely derrived from the word \u201cVlach\u201d (which has been dissected to death here on Quora, so I won\u2019t bother explaining it once again). The term Vlach was generally used by non-Romanians to refer to the Romance-speaking populations in the Balkans (including the territory of what is now Romania). It is also similar to the exonym used by Hungarians to refer to Italians to this day: Olasz. According to most Romanian historians, Romanians are the descendants of the Romanized populations that managed to survived in the hilly and mountainous areas of the former Roman province of Dacia. This is called the Daco-Roman continuity theory. It\u2019s also the main reason we named ourselves Rom\u00e2ni, aka Romanians. Hungarian historians generally disagree, insisting on the immigrationist theory, which specifies that the Romanians living in the territory of the aforementioned Roman province, are the descendants of Romanized populations originating South of the Danube, that have migrated into what was by then Hungarian territory (commonly now known as Transylvania). Since Balkan Romance-speaking populations were named Vlachs (and many still used that exonym to this day, for various reasons), Hungarians started using their version of that word: Ol\u00e1h. Prior to the late 1800\u2019s the word wasn\u2019t seen as a slur or at least I don\u2019t think so - I mean, Nicolaus Olahus y\u2019know - but I think things changed by the end of the XIXth century. Initially, it was simply an exonym used by Hungarians to refer to Romanians, mainly those living within the Hungarian kingdom\u2019s borders - I don\u2019t know if it was used for Wallachians or Moldavians as well. By the end of the XIXth century it probably turned into an offensive word, or rather was perceived as such, by Romanians. Why? See the second and third paragraphs: it would negate the origin of the Romanians (according to the Romanian side). In that sense it was/is not much different from the slur currently used by Romanians when referring to Hungarians (the B-word). So if today, some Hungarians use the word Olah, to refer to Romanians, it\u2019s not really in a positive manner. ",

            "answer_text": "Hungarians do not cal Romanians ol\u00e1h. We call them rom\u00e1n, or, if we mean other ethnic people living in Romania, we call them rom\u00e1niai. Ol\u00e1h is an old term that was widely used until the mid 1800s but as Romanians didn\u2019t like the word, we changed it gradually. I guess the only reason it is still remembered is that Ol\u00e1h is among the 10 most frequent family names. I was not fully correct though. From time to time it comes up as a term mocking them. Most of us, when we ask the question at the age of 8\u201310, as to why this name was changed to Romanian, we are told that it\u2019s because Romanians dont like it. So we use it as a curseword. Example: these days the motorways in Hungary are full of caravans carrying 2nd hand German cars - not exacly according to Traffic Code stipulations (Romanians are famous about their inventious approach when it comes to rules). So I hear many people being frustrated from the near accident situations in the following context \u201cfuck the Ol\u00e1h was riding 95 km bypassing the truck going with 90\u201d. But in a normal conversation, it never comes up. Neither its written form. So let me rephrase your question: why Hungarians used to call Romanians as Ol\u00e1h? And I would highly emphasise the expression \u2018used to\u2019. ",
