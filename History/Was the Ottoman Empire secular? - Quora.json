            "answer_text": "This is a very interesting question which brings a very interesting answer. The Ottoman Empire was neither secular neither religious. It was multireligios. To understand this right, let's see the two flags on the Ottoman coat of arms adopted in 1844 following the Tanzimat reforms: a red flag and a green flag both having a Crescent and a star in their center. The red flag symbolized the secular power represented by the title of Sultan. The Ottoman chief of state as Sultan, had power over all the nations in the Empire. In principle, the 4 nations were: 1)Muslim (sunni) 2) Roman ( Eastern Orthodox Christian) 3) Armenian (Oriental Orthodox Christian including Syriacs and Copts) 4) Jewish. Each of these 4 nations had their own autonomy with their own code of laws and their own leader. Each of these leaders ( the patriarch of Constantinople, the chief mufti, the chief rabbi and the Armenian catholicos) occupied a seat in the Ottoman Cabinet at the Sultan\u2019s palace. (After the Tanzimat reforms, the Roman nation split into several nations due to rise of nationalism in the XIXth century). The green flag symbolized the religious power of the chief of state, represented by the title Calif. The Ottoman chief of state in the quality of Calif had no authority over the nations except the Muslim one. So, as a Calif, he gave orders to the Muslims and as a Sultan he gave orders to all his subjects. Following the Tanzimat reforms, the title of Calif and the religious authority it represented were downwashed as the Empire became westernized and modernized and thus de facto increasingly secular although on paper it still kept a religious vestige. In internal and foreign diplomatic affairs, the chief of state acted mostly as a Sultan but when wars were declared on non-Muslims, the chief of state acted mostly as a Calif, head of the jihadis. The last time this happened was in the war waged by the Ottoman Empire against Turkey in the early 20's. The Ottoman chief of state declared jihad on his authority as Calif against the Turkish independentists supported by the Soviet Union and lead by Mustafa Kemal. ",

            "answer_text": "If you do not judge according to today's conditions, you will see that your answer is yes. When the Ottoman Empire conquered a region, it allowed the region to protect its religion, language, culture and its own laws. In this respect, it has similarities with the United States. There are regional laws and taxes, and also federal taxes and laws. By arranging rules and taxes arising from religious differences, they ensured that everyone lived on equal terms. In addition, although the Ottoman Empire was an empire, people of many races and religions served in the upper ranks of the empire. They are judged under equal conditions. They also allowed people of all religions to open and operate places of worship. Therefore, many races, cultures, religions and structures have been preserved for hundreds of years. Below you can see the countries that are now in the regions that the Ottoman empire has been holding for hundreds of years. Protection of everything in these countries was due to the secular nature of the Ottoman Empire.
