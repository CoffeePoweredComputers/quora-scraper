            "answer_text": "Book written by a noble price winner in literature, whose work made a positive political impact on relation between between United States and Mexico : One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez!  Review : One of the 20th century's enduring works, One Hundred Years of Solitude is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement of a Nobel Prize winning career. The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America. Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel Garcia Marquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master. Alternately reverential and comical, One Hundred Years of Solitude weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race. Bill Clinton's Friendship With the Late Gabriel Garcia Marquez.  When he was elected president, Clinton ended the decades long travel ban on Garcia Marquez, which stemmed from the author's criticisms of U.S. foreign policy.Clinton was able to meet his idol at a dinner on Martha's Vineyard hosted by William Styron in 1995 that also included Garcia Marquez\u2019s longtime friend, Carlos Fuentes, and the owners of The Washington Post and The New York Times. The two could not come to an agreement on U.S.-Cuban relations, but were able to bond over literature. Their encounters would continue, and Garcia Marquez was invited to the White House several times. Per Clinton\u2019s account, Garcia Marquez was particularly fond of Clinton\u2019s daughter, Chelsea, and the author sent her English translations of his works. Its not just another best, instead a great book of 20th century! Ref : Gabriel-garcia-marquez relatiohship with Bill-Clinton IMG SRC: Google ",

            "answer_text": "The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner  (from Rushing Images) Critically, it is the book of the 20th century. Some lists will put it at some spot other than #1, like #6 or something. Don\u2019t believe their lies. It\u2019s #1. Faulkner wrote it at the nadir of his literary living. He was working for the post office where he lived in Mississippi, wondering if he\u2019d ever get published. Back then, there weren\u2019t self-publishing avenues like now. He had to hope he\u2019d get published by a commercial outfit. He set out to do it. There\u2019s the uneasy peace between the white family and its black servants, the tension endemic in on-the-verge-of-Depression South, the constant lack of knowing what\u2019s happening to what once was a great home\u2026 Quentin Compson (1891\u20131910) is the most important character of the 20th century even though he lived barely more than half his life in it. His perspective and experiences inform a reader in a way I\u2019ve never seen a character do that before or since. \u201cJune 2, 1910\u201d is the peak of 20th-century literature. Jason Compson is probably the vilest character I\u2019ve seen in any book. He\u2019s a truly horrific person, which only makes the reader want to go on further. Context-wise, this is a book by someone who\u2019d seen The Great Gatsby (1925) published earlier that decade, then blew it out of the water. Imagine seeing a great literary scene, punctuated by greats like Fitzgerald and Hemingway, and then dousing it in gas and lighting it on fire. That\u2019s what The Sound and the Fury did. ",
