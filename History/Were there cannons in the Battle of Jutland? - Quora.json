            "answer_text": "Yes, for instance on the British fleet: 1: King George V had 5 twin 13,5-inch guns as the main armament. 2. HMS Erin 5 twin 13.5-inch guns as the main armament. 3. HMS Iron Duke 5 twin 13.5-inch guns as the main armament. Note - the mid-turret was set between higher structures of the ship (funnels, bridge, anti-aircraft gun emplacements) that restricted its zone of fire to the side of the ship in an arc I would estimate to be from perhaps a 7:30 to 10:30 arc on the left (port) side and a 1:30 to 4:30 arc on the right (starboard) side of the ship. It could not fire at an enemy in front or behind the ship. On the German fleet the battleships had: SMS Konig 10 12-inch guns as the main armament.SMS Kaiser had 10 12-inch guns as the main armament.SMS Ostfriesland Konig 12 12-inch guns in 6 turrets as the main armament.These are only a few examples, all battleships of different classes and I think it is unnecessary to go into the guns on the battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers and other vessels involved.
