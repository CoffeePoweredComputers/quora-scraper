            "answer_text": "Election of 1912: Woodrow Wilson (Democrat) 435Theodore Roosevelt (Progressive) 88William Taft (Republican) 8Taft, the incumbent, won just two states, Utah and Vermont, at four EVs apiece. Roosevelt and Taft were personal friends, but the Republican Party had been split by differences in policy (this is an oversimplification, but the GOP under Roosevelt was free-trade but generally pro-labor union and aggressively antitrust; the Taft Republicans were protectionists but anti-union and mostly opposed to antitrust.) Wilson only got 42% of the popular vote nationwide but that was more than enough to win against a GOP that was running against itself and splitting support between two candidates. Adding insult to injury, Taft\u2019s running mate James Sherman, the incumbent Vice President, died just a week before the election (10/30/1912.) The electors that had been pledged to Sherman all voted for Nicolas Murray Butler for Vice President, at Taft\u2019s request. ",
