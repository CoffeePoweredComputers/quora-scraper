            "answer_text": "They likely had no idea. As you said, people moved slowly, perhaps they walked or used horses or something else. However, even if heading west, they would still be going too slowly to be able to discern an overly extended sunset. It would seem to set normally. I think they likely thought the sun would rise and then set at the same time anywhere they went, even for a person who traveled from Greece to the Orient. There was no communication like phone, and as such no one could talk to someone several \u201ctime zones\u201d away to find out the sun had already set there. Further, depending on how far back you are going when you ask about \u201cancient people\u201d, it may be a time when believed the earth was flat. In modern times, the time zones are an artificial construct. There is no mysterious line where I move an inch over that line and the time changes an hour, except as determined by man. Technically it\u2019s gradual as the earth revolves. But we are a time-oriented society where clocks seem to have great importance. Further, in America most states use daylight savings time, which means we further mess with the clocks by artificially changing our clock times in the spring and fall every year. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question. I think they simply deduced it. They knew the Earth was round and they knew that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. They could tell when it was noon by looking the shadow cast by a vertical stick. Since the sun is moving, they knew that it would be noon earlier in a town to the east, and later in a town to the west.  Until the invention of long distance railroads made it necessary to have standardized time, every town kept its own time, and set its church clock (which people took as definitive) based on the observed local noon.

So following from that, they would deduce that sailing west would mean that, from where they're standing, the sun rises above the horizon in the east at a later time compared to wherever they started from. The effect might not be noticeable on the journey unless they had a clock, but they should be able to figure it out based on things that were known at the time. ",

As recently as the 1900's, local time was just that. If it was noon in Chicago, it could be 11:58 a few mile west in Rockford and 11:59 and 12:01 a few miles further west in Molne. The US did not adopt a universal time standard until 1918. This was primarily due to the railroads needing a universal standard. ",

While it is true some ancient peoples figure out the world was round using math and common sense (sailing ships disappear from the hull up as the sail away, for example), there was no conception of a universal time or global 24 hour period.   In ancient Greece for example different cities only a day's walk away from each other had different days, weeks, months, and festivals to celebrate them.  The concept of universal time would have seemed absurd to them. ",
