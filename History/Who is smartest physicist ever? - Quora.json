            "answer_text": "Without comparable data, we cannot say with any certainty who was the smartest (defined by IQ) physicist. We can, however, with some certainty say who the most influential physicist was. There are a few candidates\u2014I would name Galileo, Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, and Bohr as possibilities. Galileo stands out in experimental physics (and observational astronomy); Maxwell\u2019s work in electromagnetism underlies modern technological civilization; Einstein\u2019s work influenced quantum mechanics and expanded and generalized the Newtonian view of the universe; and Bohr\u2019s interpretation of quantum mechanics remains highly influential. However, it is impossible not to give Newton top billing. The Newtonian theories of dynamics and gravitation still describe our day to day experience of the universe, and his work in mathematics in discovering the calculus (Leibnitz did it independently at the same time) enabled us to describe physical law in an elegant and compact way. He laid the foundations for the science of optics. If that were not enough, he founded the Royal Society and ran the Royal Mint. It is impossible to imagine how Western science and thought would have progressed without Newton. ",

            "answer_text": "Well One might think the answer as obvious but as per my opinion there are two scientists which I feel to be the greatest\u2026 Leonardo Da VinciThe reason I mentioned Leonardo Sir first is that he is an extraordinary man! He worked in hitech war weapons and armour, biology and anatomy of humans, mathematics and decoding patterns of nature, some world famous paintings and what not! No one can say that he used to live some 5 centuries back. 2. Albert Einstein The most distinguised part of Sir Einstein is not his IQ or intelligence but the way he challenged well established laws. He proved time to be relative and thus let to totally ground breaking discovery. He published several papers\u2026Each of them were extraordinary. His discoveries include: Special relativity theoryEnergy and mass equationBrownian motionPhotoelectric effect (for which he got noble prize in 1905)His main aim was to unify all the forces of nature and he worked very hard and achieved a lot in this field. His greatest power was imagination. He could find the equations and theory just by a thought experiment. A great theoretical physicist indeed! ",
