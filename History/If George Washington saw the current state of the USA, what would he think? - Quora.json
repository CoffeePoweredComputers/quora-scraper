            "answer_text": "Interesting question\u2026I\u2019m no historian, but I\u2019ll throw some thoughts: He\u2019d be shocked at how large and economically successful we are. The idea that we\u2019d control all this land probably would have seemed pretty unlikely to him in his time \u2014 The French, English, Spanish, and Native Americans tribes were all spread across the turf that is now strictly known as the USA. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d spend a long time learning about how that happened.He\u2019d probably be surprised by how racially integrated we are \u2014 likely pleasantly so, from what little we can gather of his thoughts on slavery. He seems to have believed slaves deserved better, but was resigned to that being the natural order of things, and something he couldn\u2019t afford to do anything about. Seeing Constitutional amendments related to that change would probably be a real eye-opener for him.On the other hand, the Civil War was everything he ever feared would happen, and he\u2019d probably read about that as if it were a horror movie.He\u2019d be appalled by all the partisan fighting, as that\u2019s something he specifically wrote about in his farewell address. Federalists & Democratic-Republicans were causing infighting in Congress and his cabinet, and blasting each other in the press. I think he\u2019d be disappointed to see that things didn\u2019t change after his warning. In fact, they\u2019re probably worse now than they have been since Hamilton & Jefferson were going at it in the country\u2019s first newspapers.He\u2019d be perplexed by how involved in world politics we are. Washington\u2019s America wasn\u2019t this big and influential. They had border disputes to handle, and were trying to avoid big issues with France & England, so it\u2019s not like they were foreign to diplomacy and trade issues. But, the sort of things America does in the middle east were things he actively avoided getting us into back then. (Take for instance, the slave uprisings in the Caribbean that the South wanted us to send troops to defeat)He\u2019d be really surprised we\u2019re still using the same constitution, or that there weren\u2019t a LOT more amendments to it. There were people \u2014 like Jefferson\u2014 who thought we should have a do-over on the Constitution every 10 years or so. Given Jefferson was running for President (and became VP) as Washington was exiting, I\u2019m thinking he expected that to work out\u2026of course, when you\u2019re dealing with a country of this size, a do-over might be a tire fire to get ratified, so he\u2019d probably understand why WE don\u2019t do it now. But, the 1800s didn\u2019t do it? That\u2019d be a surprise.As to whether what we\u2019re currently doing fits what he fought for, I think he fought for the right for us to do what we think is necessary. He wouldn\u2019t expect us to run things exactly the way they did\u2026as said before, they thought their constitution was for them, and some future generation would rework the whole thing if they saw drastic enough problems. He might be uncomfortable with America meddling in world affairs, but the idea of something like the UN even existing was foreign back then. All things considered, I think he\u2019d be intrigued by it, but likely wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with that level of influence being thrown around between sovereign nations. But, he\u2019d also be the first to say that\u2019s his opinion, and that he already placed his sword in the ground long ago. ",

            "answer_text": "He would be probably confused and wouldn\u2019t know what to think On one hand the USA have the mightiest economy and army in the world, they are more influential than any other country in history and the living standard of an average American is much higher than a living standard of a rich person in 1700s. However Washington would surely disapprove the morals of current era. Washington may have been a liberal in 1700s but now he would be regarded as a paleoconservative at best. His views on equality between races and genders, role of Christianity in public life etc. were very different from the modern ones. If many people in the USA dislike someone like Ted Cruz what would they think about Washington? ",
