            "answer_text": "Colonists take over land for the benefit of their nation, empire and world view. Therefore, when a colonist goes into another nation they go with the story of brining civilization to a people as a legitimizing factor. Meaning, it is OK to take over these lands because they are backward, not efficient, and bring our civilization to these people will benefit all. Usually with harsh assimilationist policies. So, if you would like to know what colonists did in the name of civilization. Assimilate means try and convert a people to your worldview and become members of their society. Forget your roots and become modern people are usually what happens in assimilationist policies. For indigenous people who\u2019s tools of war were primitive, no match for modern guns the fight was dishonourable and any where from chivalric. Today, it would be US air wars and cruise missiles against an enemy who cannot see or even have a chance to fight back. So, yes the US is a colonizing nation and empire. Look up, PAX-Americana. ",

The colonists of Australia would do things differently to, say, Roman citizens living in one of their Colonia in conquered territory. And the answer becomes completely different if you want to know about crop production as opposed to relations with their mother country, or any number of things. ",
