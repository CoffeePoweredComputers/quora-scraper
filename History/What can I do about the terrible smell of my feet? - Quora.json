            "answer_text": "Of course advice by others here regarding hygiene and cleanliness is very important, the one thing that really, REALLY helped eliminate foot odor and \u201cathlete\u2019s foot\u201d for me was to start always wearing merino wool, or high quality moisture wicking synthetic socks. I never use any cotton socks\u2013 not ever. At one time, I mistakenly thought that because cotton is a \u201cnatural\u201d product it would be good for my feet. NOPE. Cotton socks were at the root of my foot problems\u2026 they basically caused my feet to rot because they do not wick moisture! They just get soaking wet and curdle your feet in a boiling, bacteria and fungus soup! GROSS. I stumbled on the benefits of wool, and high quality moisture wicking synthetic socks when I bought some pairs of each for skiing. Not only did they keep my feet from getting cold, they also kept them remarkably dry and comfortable. A light just came on in my head when I made the association between what these socks were made of and how good my feet felt after wearing them in tight ski boots all day. Then I started looking for lighter ones for wearing with my running shoes and found them. It was life changing, I\u2019m telling you. When I made the switch to merino wool socks (and like I said, they don\u2019t have to just be heavy winter ones either\u2013 there are really nice sport socks made of merino wool, too) my foot odor and fungus problems just vanished over a fairly short period of time. I\u2019m not making this up. It\u2019s really true. My personal favorite brand of wool socks for wearing with my running shoes is Darn Tough. Awesome sock brand\u2026 they aren\u2019t cheap, but they are worth every penny and I have found that they are very durable and hold up for a long time. This may be hard to believe, but my oldest pairs of Darn Tough \u201cno show\u201d running socks are 4 years old and still completely serviceable! There are other brands, though, just shop around. Can\u2019t hurt to at least try a few pairs of good wool and/or moisture wicking synthetic or synthetic/wool blend socks. They sure worked for me. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the main things you can do to reduce foot odor and shoe odor is to practice good foot hygiene. Keep your toenails neat and clean. Bend down and wash your feet with soap and water every day, don't just stand in the shower and assume that the soapy water will take care of it. After washing your feet, make sure they are thoroughly dry before putting on socks and shoes. If your feet tend to perspire a lot, you can try putting Ammens, Gold Bond, or another good powder on them before you put your socks on. Use a pumice stone or buffer at least once a month, before your shower or bath that day, to clean the dead skin off your feet; the dead skin is what holds the bad smell. Pay attention to your heels. I recommend the Diamancel #10 Classic Buffer, and use it myself every few weeks. You can go for a pedicure - it's a wonderful experience and will make your feet feel terrific. I see men getting pedicures all the time at the Aveda day spa I go to. Get rid of the dead skin, and wash your feet properly, and they will smell good.  Other things you can do:  Wear socks! and when you do, wear the kind made from natural fibers (cotton, wool, silk, rayon) or high-tech synthetic fibers like wicking polyester.  I can attest that when I stopped wearing nylon stockings to work every day, my feet became much healthier and happier.Wear dress shoes made from leather, with leather linings, if you can. Leather is a natural material that breathes a little bit. Synthetic leather shoes are sub-optimal. Canvas shoes are OK but don't make the mistake of thinking you can avoid their becoming skanky inside if you wear them without socks. Cotton socks are good for sneakers.Also, never wear the same pair of shoes two or more days in a row if you can avoid it. Shoes need to air out and dry out between wearings; your feet throw off a lot of humidity. You can also store your shoes with shoe trees or sachets made from cedar wood, which helps to absorb moisture and odors, and imparts a clean scent of its own.SportsDry - AdultCedar Shoe Fresh Inserts  (pair) Based on my answer to this:Odor Removal: Why do some people's shoes smell like dead goats after only a few weeks?
