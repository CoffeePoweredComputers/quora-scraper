            "answer_text": "Muslim invaders followed the word of their prophet, who instructed them to: Fight in the name of Allah, for the sake of Allah. Fight those who disbelieve in Allah. Fight but do not steal from the war booty, do not break your promises, do not mutilate (the enemy dead) and do not kill children\u2026\u201dMuslim (1731) There are many examples of how muslim invaders were cruel. I will expose two examples of their cruelty compared to the merciful, gentle Christian invaders Spain When the Muslims arrived in Iberia in 711, and after the main battle against Roderic, most of the cities and towns of Spain opened their doors to Tariq ( commander of the army) without a fight. The Muslims offered a just legal system, freedom to practice religion, and the removal of oppressive and unjust taxes. It is no wonder that Tariq\u2019s army was able to conquer the entire peninsula with a small army in a few years. The Muslims conquest of Spain could not be seen as a foreign conquest and subjugation of a native population. Instead, it is an uprising of native people (Christians aided by Muslims) against an oppressive and tyrannic government. This almost utopian society did not last forever. As the so-called Reconquista, or Reconquest, of Spain by Catholic monarchs progressed through the 11th to the 15th centuries, Spain\u2019s Muslims became a marginalized group. In 1492, when the last Muslim state of Iberia, Granada, fell, Spain\u2019s Muslims faced a new reality: genocide By 1614 every last Morisco was gone, and Islam disappeared from the Iberian Peninsula. Going from over 500,000 people to zero in 100 years can only be described as a genocide. Jerusalem (Al-quds) By 637, Numerous Muslim armies under the command of Khalid ibn al-Walid and Amr ibn al-\u2018As began to surround the city, Sophronius refused to surrender the city unless Umar (the caliph) came to accept the surrender himself. Having heard of such a condition, Umar ibn al-Khattab left Madinah, travelling alone with one donkey and one servant. When he arrived in Jerusalem, he was greeted by Sophronius, who undoubtedly must have been amazed that the caliph of the Muslims, one of the most powerful people in the world at that point, was dressed in no more than simple robes and was indistinguishable from his servant. Umar was given a tour of the city, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. When the time for prayer came, Sophronius invited Umar to pray inside the Church, but Umar refused. He insisted that if he prayed there, later Muslims would use it as an excuse to convert it into a mosque \u2013 thereby depriving Christendom of one of its holiest sites. Instead, Umar prayed outside the Church, where a mosque (called Masjid Umar \u2013 the Mosque of Umar) was later built. In AD1099, Jerusalem was conquered by the Crusaders and its inhabitants slaughtered (Muslim, Christians and Jews alike) all of them, it was a horrible massacre . For much of the 12th century it became the capital of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. In AD1187, under the leadership of Salah al-Din, Muslims recaptured the city and, much to the relief of the Christian inhabitants, there was no revenge killing. Those who wanted to leave were permitted to do so, with all their goods and belongings, and those who wanted to stay were guaranteed protection for their lives, property, and places of worship.

            "answer_text": "They actually were not. They were in fact, the most lenient. Let\u2019s look at some examples. But before we go on, you must realize the difference between \u201cinvader\u201d and \u201cconquer\u201d. Muslims mostly did conquests. And yes it was offensive war the Muslims fought, cannot deny that. But.. The Omayyads when they entered much of the world, even Spain and Italy, they kept non Muslim places of worship such as churches.They also let Christians and Jewish and other minorities to abide by their values. For example, Spain was allowed to practice their religion when it came to Christian laws such as their divorce practices, etc.The Jewish and Christian communities actually preferred to live under Muslim rule as opposed to their own rule.Ottoman empire ruled for 622 years, and took over much of South East Europe. They had the power to forcefully convert everyone, yet much of that region still speaks their own language and is Non Muslim majority.Try researching how Islam spread to Indonesia. The largest Muslim population. Also, no Muslim conquest took place there.Much of the countries today, that were under Islamic rule for more than 600 years today still speak their own language, and many are still Non Muslim majority such as India, south eastern europe such as Bosnia, Hungary, etc. These countries could have been forced to speak Arabic, or Turkish or Persian which was the language of the empires that existed there. But that didn\u2019t happen.Many Jewishand christian professors in large educational institutions wereallowed to teach due to their immense knowledge.On the contrary, lets look at the following: Spanish Empire, today much of south America speaks spanish and follows Christianity.Same goes with Portuguese Empire.Mongol Empire was brutal.British Empire killed millions. In fact, as we type and ask questions on Quora shows that their after effects of their enforced language still has us using their language. I don\u2019t have a problem with that though.French empire, again, was brutal. Killed millionsThis isn\u2019t to say all Muslims were perfect through out history. I\u2019m sure bad things happened. However, we should be fair in our criticism. ",
