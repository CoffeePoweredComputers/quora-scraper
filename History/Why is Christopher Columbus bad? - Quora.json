            "answer_text": "That really depends on what they are saying. There\u2019s a lot of misinformation about Columbus out there, and a lot of people have mis-quoted Bartolome de las Casas (a priest who spent his whole life devoted to ending the oppression of the native people by the Spanish), and quoted things he wrote about OTHER people who came after Columbus, saying Columbus did those things. Las Casas wasn\u2019t one of Columbus\u2019 men\u2026he came to the \u201cNew World\u201d with Nicolas de Ovando (the third governor of the Spanish colonies on Hispaniola). The confusion may come because Bartolome de las Casas\u2019 father sailed with Columbus. I\u2019ve been reading las Casas works\u2026both \u201cA Short Account of the Desctruction of Indies\u201d (which lists a lot of atrocities against the native people, often without telling specifically who did them or when, leading to confusion), and his longer work, \u201cHistory of the Indies\u201d (which does usually tell who did things, and when). In \u201cHistory of the Indies,\u201d las Casas both told about things he personally saw, and about other things he researched from letters, journals, and from talking with people who were there. So what did Columbus do? On Hispaniola (current day Haiti/Dominican Republic) he subjugated some natives, enslaved others, got into conflicts and wars with some of them, and didn\u2019t prevent the men/colonists under him from abusing them (though he made some efforts to stop this). His use of natives for labor in the new world caused such disruption of their society that they were not able to keep up crops which caused famine which caused thousands of deaths. The spread of \u201cold world\u201d diseases like smallpox also came with colonization, though it was unintentional and not well understood back then. He also probably did some pretty harsh punishment of the colonists/men under him (he had a man\u2019s nose and ears cut off for stealing, and his brother had women\u2019s tongue cut off for insulting Columbus). What Columbus DIDN\u2019T do (that he\u2019s been false accused of) - 1. He did not commit genocide. It was clear from his writings that Columbus thought the natives were necessary for the survival of the colonies. He exploited them\u2026he didn\u2019t want them exterminated. There were men who came later who did commit massacres that could be described as genocide. 2. It was not under his command that men cut natives to test their blades, beheaded young boys for fun, and generally killed Indians for sport. This was under Bobadilla, which las casas described as allowing the men to do basically whatever they wanted in regards to the natives, in contrast to the restraint that he described Columbus attempting to put on them. 3. It was under Nicolas de Ovando, not Columbus, that during a massacre men chased children as they fled and cut off their legs (during this massacre\u2026they also barricaded the native leaders in a hut and burned them alive) 4. He didn\u2019t go out kidnapping young girls for sex slaves. You may have heard this quote: \u201cA hundred castellanos are as easily obtained for a woman as for a farm, and there are plenty of dealers who go about looking for girls; those from nine to ten are now in demand, and for all ages a good price must be paid.\u201d Taken out of context you could get the idea that he was involved with or encouraging that practice, but he wasn\u2019t. That quote is from a letter where he was defending himself from charges of mistreating the colonists he had been governing, and he was doing so by giving examples of how horrible the colonists were. That was just one example. The very next lines he writes after that are: \u201cI assert that the violence of the calumny of turbulent persons has injured me more than my services have profited me; which is a bad example for the present and for the future. I take my oath that a number of men have gone to the Indies who did not deserve water in the sight of God and of the world; and now they are returning thither, and leave is granted them. \u201c Basically, he\u2019s saying people who do that don\u2019t deserve to live, not that this is a good business idea.

Enjoy :) The Killer We Choose to Celebrate A racist, mass murder, a sinister homicide: This is most definitely not the description of a person that deserves to be celebrated year after year, where we praise each and every one of the diabolical crimes that he committed. However, this is exactly what we are doing without even realizing it. This black-hearted killer is Christopher Columbus. This 15th-century voyager wrote in his personal journal that he brought on his journey, \u201cThey do not carry arms nor are they acquainted with them, because I showed them swords and they took them by the edge and through ignorance cut themselves . . . They should be good and intelligent servants\u201d (Bourne). This immoral man is treating the natives as if they were his slaves, yet, we still celebrate his wrongdoings every October? Columbus Day and Christopher Columbus should not be praised, celebrated, and taught in the United States because he harmed many indigenous people of America, he is not a good role model to teach young children about every year, and he did not even discover America. From the very moment that Christopher Columbus stepped foot onto the New World in 1492, he had possessed an immense amount of ascendancy over the Native Americans. They treated him as if he was their god, for he had just suddenly appeared in a time of suffering. These innocent people worshiped Columbus, so what did the cruel man do? Christopher Columbus murdered and enslaved them. According to an article titled, \u201cSpeaking of Cutting Off People\u2019s Hands, Happy Columbus Day!\u201d in \u201cPhiladelphia Magazine,\u201d he believed that in the location that he landed, Haiti, there was an abundance of gold that was yet to be dug up. However, this island only had a scarce amount of gold that was nearly impossible to be collected, since it was just fine dust inside of the streams. Despite this fact, he made his slaves collect a specific amount of gold every three months, with consequences of their hands being chopped off and bleeding to death if they failed to complete his ludicrous task, which happened to approximately ten thousand people (Coard). This evidence shows that Christopher Columbus, the man who is celebrated the second Monday of every October, chopped off everybody\u2019s hands if they did not provide him with enough gold. Since gold was meager in Haiti when he landed there, barely any of the Native Americans that he inhumanely enslaved were able to supply him with enough of it. This nearly impossible task caused about ten thousand of these innocent people, who never caused him any harm in the first place, to bleed to death. Christopher Columbus was a cruel man that horrifically ended the lives of essentially all of the Native Americans that he encountered on his journey to the New World. Therefore, we should definitely not be celebrating him whatsoever. Columbus Day is celebrated year after year, and many elementary schools spend days teaching their students about his \u201cdiscoveries\u201d because their curriculums require for the topic to be taught around the time of the dreadful day. If teachers inform their students that Columbus was this righteous man that marvelously discovered America, students will likely believe them, although they are being taught a lie. Ali Michael, Ph.D., the co-founder and director of the Race Institute for K-12 Educators states, \u201cIf your students are too young to learn about genocide, don\u2019t teach them about genocide. But don\u2019t teach them falsehoods that they will have to later unlearn. Falsehoods that go in early form the template of our assumptions and common knowledge, and are very hard to unlearn.\u201d This statement means that we should not be telling young students lies about history because we want to shield them from the truth, just do not do it at all. If the students are too young to know about difficult times that occurred in the past, let it be and do not teach them lies. Elementary level students should not be exposed to topics of mass murder, such as the genocide that occurred in Columbus\u2019 time. If we teach them fallacies to conceal the truth, they will struggle to learn once again about how it truly happened. We should not be falsifying history, so we should not be telling students that Christopher Columbus just sailed the ocean blue in fourteen ninety-two, found America, and was a great, upstanding person. We should not be celebrating a cold-hearted killer, and should definitely not be teaching the children about him, especially not falsehoods. Christopher Columbus created numerous issues when he arrived in the New World through his journey. Not only was he a nefarious human being, but he did not even do what he gets all of his recognition for. Everybody knows Christopher Columbus as this incredible explorer who discovered America, however, he did not even do that. According to Christopher Klein, an author who specializes in history, \u201cNearly 500 years before the birth of Christopher Columbus, a band of European sailors left their homeland behind in search of a new world. Their high-prowed Viking ship sliced through the cobalt waters of the Atlantic Ocean as winds billowed the boat\u2019s enormous single sail. After traversing unfamiliar waters, the Norsemen aboard the wooden ship spied a new land, dropped anchor and went ashore.\u201dAccording to the author, Columbus was not actually the person who discovered America. Approximately half a millennium before he is said to of discovered America, the Vikings discovered the land first. He receives all of the recognition for discovering this new land, however, he was not the first outsider to find America. Columbus does not deserve any of this praise for something he did not do. Not only is he recognized for a significant event that he was not even a part of, he was also a terrible person towards the people that he encountered in America, and therefore, he should most definitely not be celebrated. On the other hand, there is still a share of people who believe that Columbus Day should be celebrated. They hold the belief that, although Christopher Columbus did not actually discover America, he did begin a chapter of beneficial voyages to the New World. Leah Shafer, a former staff writer at Harvard University, and Bari Walsh, a senior editor of many articles also at Harvard, wrote the article \u201cThe Columbus Day Problem\u201d for the \u201cHarvard Graduate School of Education\u201d website, which stated that, although Christopher Columbus did not discover America, or anywhere in the New World for that matter, his journeys there did begin a new chapter of the history of our planet. This was when he contributed to the transfer of cultures, ideas, etc., from the Old World to the New World. To summarize, although it does make sense to believe that Columbus did begin a turning point in the history of voyages and discovering new land, he is credited for discovering America, which he did not actually do at all, just lead to said discovery by people much better than him. In addition to this, he maliciously murdered many of the native people that were inhabitants of the New World before he even stepped a foot there. Such a malevolent man should most definitely not be celebrated annually. Although he may have contributed to some benefits towards discovering the New World, all of his wrongdoings outweigh the few successes that he withheld within his lifetime. Innocent children are being taught lies about a man who supposedly discovered America, and adults are choosing to celebrate all of his wrongdoings without even realizing it. Columbus should not be praised, for he was a cold-hearted killer that did not do what he is, to this day, credited for. There are countless reasons as to why we should no longer be celebrating Christopher Columbus\u2019 purposeless holiday. We should not be celebrating Columbus Day due to the fact that he harmed many of the Native Americans, he is far from a role model that should be taught to younger children, and he was not actually the first outsider to step foot in America. Christopher Columbus was a vile being that remorselessly murdered many of America\u2019s indigenous people. The barbaric genocide that occurred in his time was excessively brutal, and should undoubtedly not be taught to elementary level students, and we should undeniably not be teaching them lies to conceal the truth. Finally, we are praising him and celebrating his holiday in the first place because he is believed to be the one to discover America, though he did not even do that in the first place. If we all cooperatively end the celebration of such a repugnant holiday and begin to celebrate those who truly benefited towards the discovery of the New World, such as the indigenous Americans and the Vikings, we will at last be able to put a stop to the nonsense. We are celebrating an insignificant historical figure, who also happens to be a murderer. Instead of celebrating an abhorrent person in which we are supposed to look up to, we must join forces to start praising those who are candidly deserving of it!
