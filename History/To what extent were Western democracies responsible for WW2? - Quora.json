            "answer_text": "Well I guess you could blame them for Versailles Treaty although had they upheld the treaty (with the threat or actually using force) Germany would never have been able to rearm and get powerful enough to start a major war. Instead Britain and America more or less washed their hands from the European continent after WW1 and left France holding the bag. Now I think France\u2019s army was strong enough till at least 1937 to take on Germany alone but once she failed to stop Hitler from remilitarizing the Rhineland the odds kept becoming worse and worse. Frankly the Western Demoracies kept feeling sorry for Germany and slowly gave way on Versailles conditions, forgave the loan, let Germany rearm, etc. I don\u2019t think Germany would have been so lenient to France had she won WW1. The ultimate western mistakes were American isolationism and French and British appeasement. The British and French did rearm late in the day too and had they done so earlier (and more robustly) perhaps they could have beaten Germany in 1939 or allowed France to survive in 1940. But yaa the failure to uphold the Versailles treaty, the failure to deter and threaten Germany when she was weaker, along with appeasement and isolationism failed to stop Hitler rearming Germany and going to war and in that sense makes them indirectly responsible for the outbreak of war to some extent ",

            "answer_text": "The Second World War can be seen in three phases. First Germany and it\u2019s client state Slovakia attacked Poland, secondly Britain and France declared war on Germany, third the Axis countries of the 2 different continents declared war on the US while binding themselves together in military alliance. So from this we can say Hitler was responsible for starting it, Britain and France were responsible for expanding it and then the Axis countries were responsible for expanding it further. Therefore it is fair to say Britain and France were responsible for part of it though one should bear in mind that at some point Hitler left to his own devices would probably have pushed west anyway and so even if Britain and France had just done nothing the rest of the war would probably have still occured sooner or later. In terms of the Treaty of Versailles it is true that the western democracies made errors but this was mainly by not seeking to properly redress the power balance between France and Germany. I\u2019d say that makes them a bit responsible for what happened later but not completely and certainly not as responsible as Hitler himself and his chief nazi accomplices. ",
