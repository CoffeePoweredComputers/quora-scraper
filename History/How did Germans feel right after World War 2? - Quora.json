            "answer_text": "They were hungry, cold, disoriented, traumatized, sad because of the loss of loved ones, of homes and perspectives. Every human being lives in networks, in concrete spaces and in time frames reaching from a concrete past to a concrete future. A life has to be meaningful to be worth living. In 1945, many things had just disappeared: houses, persons, bridges, words, convictions and grammars. Everything had been tested and had been revealed as destructible and fallible. Some houses had ignited in firestorms, had collapsed or were about to collapse or had remained untouched miraculously. Some humans had survived earth-shattering horrors, had observed or done monstrous things, had found out that everything could disintegrate. So they clung to certainties, avoided everything that might be unexploded devices, land mines. In a world that had proved to be brittle people clung to the tiniest certainties like a fag-end picked up on the sidewalk by someone hungering for a puff. The Hitler kraken had instrumentalized almost all forms of public and private existence, of traditions, aspirations and hates. A complex and diverse culture had been brushed Nazi brown and had been compromised. April 30th, 1945: There was Hitler sneaking away into suicide. He had cursed the Germans: \u201cYou have not sacrificed enough for me. You should follow me in suicide.\u201d With the nightmare evaporated into thin air few followed suit. Most people dropped into a zombie world- Men, mainly men. were hollow men, mesmerized by a cocktail of fear, pain, guilt and shame. Everyone was in need of a trauma therapy but was too busy moving the ruins and scars from sight and following the new victors. We five-year old survival artists were sursprisingly good in smelling rot and inauthenticity. We had been saved by mothers that had replaced the men on their extended military murder-and-be-murdered ventures and now excelled in creating pockets of sanity as widowed single parents. I and many of my age mates smelled the rot in paternal Germany and searched the world and the times for beauty, certainty and better dreams. I was too young to be a good eyewitness . but then everybody was disoriented and confused. I lived in a textile and leather town that had copied Manchester on a smaller scale and had blossomed as a supplier of uniforms and boots. It had been bombed haphazardly: I and my fatherless family had, against all odds, not been blown to smithereens . Schleswig-Holstein was the last province to be conquered. So it filled up with refugees: at first the top Nazis, then the flotsam and jetsam uprooted from defeated parts of Germany and ex-soldiers wearing army greatcoats without insignia. We had a relatively spacious flat so tenants were added. My mother shared a bedroom with a Danish friend. (She had to leave Denmark because she had a German lover and had been ostracized because of that.) There was a TB-afflicted ex-soldier, who ate fatty fish but died neverthe-less. There was a couple from the east. He did hard labour because that increased food ration coupons. He died when his appendicitis was not treated right away. Everybody cultivated links to farmers to stock up supplies like potatoes and turnips. There were long queues in front of scarce shops and black markets (run by petty criminals and tolerated by the victors). The black market currency were Players and Chesterfields. Black marketeers also raided the countryside for pigs that squeaked horribly during rhe nights in their death throes, British soldiers kept curfew controls with mixed success. Farmers and family businesses were fundamental. Bank savings in Reichsmark were insecure and would be wiped out with the currency change to DMark. Women had run things while their men carried war all over Europe. Men never returned or came back sick, traumatized and crippled in body and mind. So women were breadwinners, household heads and were courageous and strong. They were burdened with unwanted pregnancies and the STDs menfolk had picked up. They removed ruins. They sometimes could not cope. My mother\u00b4s best friend was so desperate that she took her and her children\u00b4s lives with the substandard rat poison she could afford. They died horribly almost a week long. (That she was a caring mother made things even more terrifying.) Women were ignored by the postNazis and the 1950s media, which wanted women back in household and family. Even when feminism arrived in Germany in the 1960s, the young feminists did not honour my mother\u00b4s generation. Winters were cold, space and food were scarce and on ration. Wood and coal had to be acquired by hook and by crook. But people were also happy to be alive and often willing to have a good laugh. Necessity made them relatively good neighbours. German men, a sorry lot, had been Hitler\u00b4s willing tools in pillaging and burning. They had been willing cogs in a destructive machine. My father had bled to death in the Uktaine 4 weeks into Enterprise Barbarossa, but my teachers and uncles came back as soiled goods. Compared to the laid-back, Welsh and English soldiers, German men in their gray army greatcoats without insignia were bots. We kids did not want to be like them: They had messed up because they were gullible and spineless. They were postwar opportunists by switching to the next set of victors. My generation would, later on, try to clean up two messes: the Nazi mess and the Adenauer / Ulbricht messes that came in its wake and left the problems and causes of the unimaginable horror largely unsolved. We had mixed and flawed successes. We have to ask for forgiveness for having been the children of hollow men and having failed to clean up things sufficiently for our own children. We under-tens understood some things and others we did not. But the horror of two world wars and the awareness that we are not out of wars and genocides are still with us. ",

            "answer_text": "I am Russian and I was working in retirement home in Hamburg (1991\u20131992). I often had conversations with old Germans about war time. Some were prisoners of war in Siberia, some managed to escape service in German army, one was too young to serve but became a prisoner anyway. They ALL told me things they would never tell their own children and grandchildren (their own words, not my impression). Not that their children were eager to hear about past of their fathers. They all told me that they supported Hitler initially because Germans were really tired from Jews taking all clean profitable jobs and making Germans second-class citizens in their own country. They all told me that Hitler was a complete idiot because he invaded Russia. They respected Russian soldiers and some were very friendly, one old man gave me a warm fur coat (practically new) and told me to deliver it to my father (after I told him that my dad stormed Sevastopol). They understood that they deserved what they got and were glad to be left alive. Life was very difficult after war but for these old Germans it was more life being young in Siberia than being 90 years old in comfortable retirement home where nobody visits and never talks to them. In Soviet Union we had almost the same hunger and survivors were very exhausted by war and huge losses, but at least our fathers were proud that they could protect their Motherland and win this bloody war. They told us about their battles not just in families but also were invited to speak at schools etc. They were very respected and therefore happy at least on Victory Day, May 9. Old Germans were deeply ashamed for the rest of their lives. My father on Victory Day (he passed long time ago already)   By the way, he spoke fluent German because before war he was studying it at school and also because his family shared a yard with Russian Germans which comprised a good percent of population in Crimea, Russian Empress Catherine the Great (former German princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst) invited them en masse when she acquired Crimea from Ottoman Empire. German settlers were well respected and had no problems before WWII when they all were relocated away from lands that could become occupied, mostly to Kazakhstan. Details about fate of Russian Germans can be found here: Volga Germans - Wikipedia - this Wiki article is called Volga Germans but in Crimea situation was practically the same. Only after Perestrojka Russian German exile was over and as I know some Germans returned to Crimea, I personally know one man who moved from Kazakhstan to Germany and then moved to Crimea where he feels more like home. According to news agency Deutsche Welle 1,500 ethnic Germans have sent applications to move to Republic of Crimea since the beginning of 2016. My answer perhaps is not the most typical, but Russian Germans are also Germans and should not be forgotten, they also endured a lot of hardships because of idiotic Hitler\u2019s invasion.
