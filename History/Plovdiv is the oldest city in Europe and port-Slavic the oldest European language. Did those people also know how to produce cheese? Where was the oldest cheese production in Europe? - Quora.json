            "answer_text": "First, we have to consider your claim that Plowdiw or Plovdiv in Bulgaria is in fact the oldest city in Europe. Yes, archeologists have found traces of habitation by Thracian tribes that date from the 6th century BCE on a hilltop near the present-day town. But at Lepenski Vir, a Middle and Neolithic archaeological site on the territory of the Serbian municipality of Majdanpek at the Iron Gate on the Danube, the first traces of settlement date back to about 7000 BC, which makes it at least as old if not older. The settlement reached its peak between 5300 and 4800 BC. Another claimant would be Athens, which has been continously settled for at least 5,000 years, starting with the Cave of Schist, which has been dated to between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. And don\u2019t forget Cadiz which was founded around 1104 BC as Gadir or Agadir by Phoenicians from Tyre, who had established a port here already in the 7th century BCE. It is considered by some experts to be the most ancient city still standing in Western Europe. According to Bethany Moncel writing in the Spruce Eats, it is thought that cheese was first discovered around 8000 BC when sheep were first domesticated. Rennet, the enzyme used to make cheese, is naturally present in the stomachs of ruminants. The leak-proof stomachs and other bladder-like organs of animals were often put to use to store and transport milk and other liquids. Without refrigeration, warm summer heat in combination with residual rennet in the stomach lining would have naturally curdled the milk to produce the earliest forms of cheese. The production of cheese therefore predates recorded history, but we can assume it originated somewhere in the Middle East or Central Asia. ",

            "answer_text": "Sorry to rain on your parade, but scientists have found traces of what they believe is the world's oldest cheese - and it was made in Croatia by Neolithic farmers more than 7,000 years ago. During excavations of ancient pottery, researchers found residues of a feta-like cheese on the remains of rhyton drinking horns and sieves dating back to 5300 BCE. The team says their discovery means humans were making cheese 2,000 years earlier than previously thought, pushing the date back from the Bronze Age to the Neolithic era:  An aerial view he great cheese-dig and some of the cheesy implements uncovered, including the sieve-like pottery used for straining curds out of whey. Access to fresh milk and cheese has been linked to the spread of agriculture across Europe, starting around 9,000 years ago. Fermented dairy products were easier for Neolithic humans to store and were relatively low in lactose content; while young children of the era could drink milk, many adult farmers were lactose intolerant. It was also more portable and longer lasting than liquid milk, it enabled early farming to spread into cooler central and northern areas. I\u2019m sure cheese lovers everywhere will be ecstatic to find out more about the origins and antiquity of their favourite food: cheese production was indeed the breakthrough technology which transformed humanity!
