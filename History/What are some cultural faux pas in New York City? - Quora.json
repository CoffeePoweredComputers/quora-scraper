            "answer_text": "Don't jump the line, or even try, in a bus queue, store, etc. Got a death wish?In Manhattan, nearly every person I've met isn't really a New Yorker. Transplants from smaller cities seem to have the most trouble adjusting to the unpublished but very strict rules about public behavior that makes a city of 9M people livable.Public transit, which is heavily used, also has very strict rules: no jumping the line, or failing to give your seat to an old lady, a pregnant lady, an old man, or someone with a cane. Someone from Queens, the Bronx, or Staten Island may be watching you. Not for nothing was The Godfather filmed in Staten Island. There are standards to maintain. Otherwise, how would people live in such close proximity?Don't argue with the police. About anything. You won't win. Your car will stay in the impound. No matter how right you are. The cops on the beat have heard every lame answer there is. Trying to insist you\u2019re right when you know you\u2019re wrong will only buy you more trouble. Rikers, the jail, has a really horrible reputation, well deserved. You won\u2019t be top dog there.There is no right on red in the 5 boros. Get caught (likely), and you'll get a ticket. There are now a huge number of cameras positioned at intersection that will record your 65 mph flight thru a barely yellow light. No arguing with the transit police. The speed limit is 65, and those cameras are being used. Have a nice, expensive ticket.Don't wear attention-grabbing, status jewelry on public transportation. You and your fiance from Philadelphia may love wearing your matching Patek Phillipe watches on the train, along with your \"I SPENT BIG MONEY ON THIS\" handbag and accessories. You should therefore be pissing your money away on a taxi. Anyone who wears show-offy I'm Better than You shit on public transportation has anything coming to him/her that happens.If you think you can cross Queens Boulevard at a leisurely pace because you want to, just tell us where to send the body parts.Andy Cheung is so right about diplomatic immunity. Diplomats are hated worse than smallpox. On an evolutionary scale, they're probably a step down.Contrary to white supremacist and white flight belief, not all people with darker skin are killers. The hispanic man in Corona who carries your laundry cart down 2 flights of stairs for you isn't interested in stealing your ratty jeans--he is being the ultimate gentleman. Gracias is in order.If you're white, English-speaking, and native-born, you will be in the vast minority in almost all boroughs except Manhattan below 125th St., and most of Staten Island. Damn, how could I forget the despised parts of hipster Brooklyn.Most of them are so clueless they stumble into places they shouldn't be and wonder why there are no artisanal bespoke varenki or why the abuelas selling churros don't speak English. They are generally terrified of people of any color, so they avoid these areas.Don't be surprised when people are, uh, friendly isn't the word, but will jump in to offer an opinion on something. Although many people in NY don't drive, they LOVE to help you park, and usually (if you don't have a rear camera) the help is invaluable. Expect unsolicited advice about what you're picking out in a store, and what a group of ethnic ladies think of your novio if he gets off the train and leaves you to go home alone. You will be seen as a novia malfortunato, and be advised to do better than HIM.Don't dawdle. Keep up with traffic.Don't act like an asshole on public transportation. Doing this and worse will get you a demonstration of how many undercover MTA cops there are on buses and the train, utzed from the ride, and possibly a free trip to Rikers. You won't have a friend on the bus. They'll applaud when you get kicked off. Yeah, your father's big in Greenwich, you've always driven drunk, but be drunk and nasty on the Bx 12 and the passengers will aid in giving the cops a hand in accidentally stomping on you.If you value anything, lock it and ALL its component partsDon't block the box (intersection). Do not try to draft on the last car on the yellow light. This ain't DesMoines, it ain't LA. It's also highly likely to get you a ticket. My daughter works in one of the more homeless-filled and aggressive areas of an outer borough. The police there couldn't possibly be paid enough. If you're going to smash bottles over the heads of friends and get the same in return, and you pass out in the intersection, and lie on the ground screaming, the cop may remark you deserve for causing the ruckus, as you wait for the ambulance. \"Ya know, you're blocking the box.\" Try to keep your assaults to parks and sidewalks, with acquaintances.Addendum: There seems to be a trend among people, especially among wealthy Silicon Valley residents, who\u2019ve suddenly decided they don\u2019t have to tip. If this is your attitude, don\u2019t come to New York. For many people, especially waitstaff and delivery people, tips constitute the major portion of their pay. People who can most easily afford to tip the standard 15 - 20% want to leave no tips. Unless they get treated like a visiting rajah.Whether they know the pay rate for waitstaff is special, so far below minimum wage or not, PAY THE TIP, JERK.Both my daughter and I have seen well to do people attempt to stiff waitstaff at busy, well known restaurants and then get chased down the street by staff. Usually they end up with their due. Until the laws are changed and waitstaff gets paid in wages what tips brings, you are OBLIGATED to tip. If you don\u2019t, stay home, get take out (at the store), or go to a grocery store.There's an epidemic of people/morons who feel they must walk side by side, in groups as large as 10. Some women of a certain age and size also get very territorial about owning the sidewalk. I've found this to be especially big in the NYU area and the UES. I'm old, skinny, nondescript, but still have a lot of muscular strength and strong bones thanks to a lifetime of competitive running and enjoyment of sports.I've hipchecked more than one of this group--hey, not nice, but forcing an old lady into a busy street? Even less nice. I got here first. In NYC, and on this planet.There are endless faux pas to be made, but if you keep the Quoran ideal in mind: be nice, be respectful--most natives will forgive you, and even try to help. ",

            "answer_text": "Don't say you're \"from New York\" when you're from New Jersey or Long Island. There are very nice parts of New Jersey and Long Island; some very nice people live there. But this is not Boston - you don't get to say you're \"from New York City\" if you're from slightly outside it. If your prevarication is discovered, this is a quick route to contempt.Never ever ever EVER refer to the city as \"the Big Apple.\" If you say this, you are a tourist, and a clueless one at that. Using the phrases \"only in New York!\" and \"a New York minute\" falls in the same category, but they may be used, sparingly, by long-time residents, with a heavy dose of irony.Don't refer to the subway lines by their color. Instead, refer to them by their numbers and letters - e.g. it's not the \"Green Line,\" it's the \"4, 5, 6.\" When referring to a specific service along that line, each is called a \"train,\" rather than a \"subway\" - e.g. the \"6 train,\" not the \"6 subway.\" When referring to the entire system, it's the \"subway\" - not the \"Metro,\" the \"Underground,\" etc.Don't wear \"I Heart NY\" t-shirts, or indeed any article of clothing that mentions New York in any capacity, with the exception of gear supporting a sports team.If there is a wait for something or a bottleneck, don't mob it - form a line. And when a line has been formed do NOT try to cut it. Seriously. This is for your own health.When you get on a bus or step up to a subway turnstile, have your change or MetroCard ready. There's a special circle of hell devoted to people who waste 20 seconds of everyone else's time with their fumbling.Don't ask people where you can find good \"New York Pizza.\" In New York, it's just called pizza - most New Yorkers don't even know \"New York Pizza\" is a thing outside New York, or that there is a \"New York-style\" (see Where can you get New York-style Pizza in London? and its ilk). Just go to the local corner pizza shop and help yourself; I promise it'll have \"New York-style pizza\" unless it says very explicitly otherwise.Corollary to the above - do not say you prefer Chicago, New Haven or (God help you) California pizza. This is a direct route to a heated argument.I've seen more petty spats over this than over just about anything else in New York; don't steal another's cab. But how, you might ask, should one know a cab's rightful owner? It's simple. Taxi possession works on a territorial, first-come-first-serve system. If someone is trying to hail a cab on the street, he has established his territory there, so don't infringe by trying to hail one there too. Going farther up the stream of traffic to cut him off is also taboo. The polite distance varies by location and time. In Midtown at rush hour and the Lower East at 2am, a block is standard; early mornings in residential neighborhoods can require two full blocks or more.When you refer to locations in Manhattan, don't give the Avenue first - always start with the Street. If you're going to 9th Street and 3rd Avenue, say \"Ninth and Third,\" never \"Third and Ninth.\"Perhaps less of a faux pas, but a sure tipoff that you're a tourist; if you're in Manhattan, don't refer to \"North\" and \"South;\" it's \"Uptown\" and \"Downtown,\" respectively.If you are not front-office at a financial institution, don't call yourself a \"banker.\" There's absolutely nothing wrong with managing a Wells Fargo branch; there's nothing wrong with working on the tech side at a financial institution. In New York, however, \"banker\" indicates that you're a front-office type. If you're caught cheating here, you'll totally blow your credibility and possibly take some ridicule.New York is a walking city. Very few places are located directly on public transit and most journeys require at least some walking. It's often the fastest way around, and it's definitely the healthiest, cheapest, and best for the environment. If you're in New York, don't complain about having to walk.New York eats late - don't propose dinner earlier than 7pm unless the other party has kids. People won't hate you for violating this, but they may give you a strange look.This may seem like a no-brainer, but I've encountered it way too often: if you are a tourist, don't bring up 9/11. Out-of-towners are frequently more open and talkier than New Yorkers, and we appreciate that the rest of the country felt a kinship with us. Admittedly, sometimes, we do feel like talking about it. But bringing it up first, or in casual conversation, is just poor taste.Perhaps less of a faux pas and more of a pet peeve; don't ask \"What's a good restaurant?\" or \"What's a good hotel?\" There are literally thousands of restaurants and hotels in New York, many of them good. Specify what you're looking for (price point, atmosphere, neighborhood or access to neighborhoods, type of cuisine, etc.) and you'll get a much more positive response.This one is absolutely vital - don't interfere with others' privacy. New York is a very crowded place. The way people deal with it is to create their own space. Thus, what outsiders often see as aloofness and isolation is, in fact, a sign of community; there is a shared ethos that everyone respects others' privacy and expects others to respect his own. This is chiefly communicated through eye contact. If you stare at someone on the subway: if you linger in looking out your window into someone else's bedroom; if you react to or interrupt a celebrity; or if you seem to be intentionally listening in to another's conversation, you are violating one of New York's most sacred unwritten rules. Keep yourself to yourself, buddy, and let others do the same.Don't tip like you do at home; tip at New York rates. This has already been touched on by a few other answers, but it needs some explanation. The people who make life easier for you in New York --taxi drivers, servers, etc.--  are paid scant wages and depend on tips for a large part of their income. Yet they still have to survive in one of the most expensive cities in the world. If you fail to tip at New York rates for decent service, you are not paying for that service. Tipping 15% is an insult and 16-18% is parsimonious. While I hate to point fingers, I'm looking particularly at our friends from Europe here. If you think Americans' being loud, fat, monolingual, and ignorant in your beloved cities is obnoxious, your failure to pay for service rendered is downright criminal. It's an expensive city; pull the Gauloise from your lips, reach into the pocket of your lederhosen, pull out an extra quid or two and pony up!Do not touch a stranger's kid. This is a sad rule, because nearly all the people who break it are extraordinarily warm and sweet and have nothing but the best intentions. In a lot of places, children are raised communally; it may be normal to high five or pick up a stranger's kid who walks up, to lift her onto an empty seat on the subway, to play patty-cakes with her, or to chastise her if she misbehaves. But do NOT try this in New York. While New York is one of the safest cities in America, parents of city kids are protective and will not be happy.Don't fake a New York accent. You'll sound like an idiot, and most people here speak either with a foreign accent (if they speak English), or with a nondescript accent anyway.--- Bonus! Things that are not faux pas in New York, but elsewhere may be: Feel free to talk about where you live and how much you pay for it. All true New Yorkers are obsessed with real estate and will likely not think it rude if you ask quite personal questions about how much they pay, their building, their neighbors, etc. (see Real Estate in New York City) On the flip side of this, most New Yorkers wouldn't find it gauche at all for another to talk about these matters.Feel free to interrupt someone who is speaking to agree with them. This is considered polite, if occasionally annoying. Don't be frightened.Feel free to call yourself a New Yorker only a few years after moving here. One of my college roommates was from Maine. He used to scoff at 2nd generation Mainers - people who had been born in Maine and who described themselves as being \"from Maine,\" yet whose parents had moved there from elsewhere. The exact phrase he used was, \"if the cat has kittens in the oven, they're not muffins!\" So expressive, the Mainers. Anyway, that expression does not apply at all to New York. Sometimes it seems like everyone here is from somewhere else. But the only thing you need to become as true a New Yorker as someone whose family has been here for centuries is a few years residence and a genuine love for the city. It's a fiercely exclusive club that's open to all.Feel free to tell your taxi exactly the route you want to take. After a few years, everyone figures out their own tricks for getting around and gets to know certain areas and traffic patterns very well. While most taxi drivers are very good at their jobs, they have a huge area to cover and may not know all the subtleties for your particular spot. Don't be rude; don't be pushy, but do feel free to ask for a specific route.",
