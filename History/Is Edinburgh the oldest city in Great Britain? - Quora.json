            "answer_text": "Not by any measure. The oldest settlement is Amesbury in Wiltshire dating from around 8800 BChowever it isn't a city. The oldest city by incorporation (i.e. becoming a city) is Newcastle in 1080 AD. Going from the traditional definition of city as in containing a Cathedra or Bishopric, several cities would have been around from the Church's inception. Many Cities were Roman but also built on pre-Roman sites, many are much older than Edinburgh.I'd Suggest traditional capitals like York and Salisbury have a better claim, or the religious centre of Canterbury, all these are older than Edinburgh. Edinburgh was only made a city in 1329 AD, its a newbie. ",

            "answer_text": "No, Edinburgh is post-Roman. It seems there may have been a hillfort there sometime early in the 7th century \u2014 possibly where the castle is today or perhaps at Arthur's Seat. There is a record that it was besieged in AD 638. A number of places in England claim to be the oldest settlement, including Colchester, capital of Roman Britain, mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History of AD 77. London, of course, was also Roman. (Some towns in Oxfordshire/Berkshire/Wiltshire make similar claims of ancientness to Colchester, but they were never cities.) ",
