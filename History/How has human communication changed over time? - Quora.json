            "answer_text": "Nothing is static, life changes, everything in life also change. The socio-cultural, political and religious systems upon which life anchors change from time to time. Prominent among society\u2019s social system is communication, which is the process of sending message from a sender to a receiver. Over the years, communication between individuals, groups, and society to society have changed. In the past, words of mouth was the major means of communication, even as it remains the primary source of communication, a lot has changed with the words of mouth. Two hundred years ago, there was no telephone, there was no telegraph, there was no telegram. But not today, the world has gone beyond copper wire communication; the world has gone beyond telegraph and message from it, the telegram. Even though, these technologies prepared man for better and more efficient communication Technologies, but the world has gone millions ahead with technologies. Yesterday, man communicated in signs and symbols, man used colors to send messages. Colors like: black, red, green, blue, white, purple, scarlet, orange, yellow, ash, pink and many more had communication values, though, man may not fully used these communication channels as before because of the changing world, they are still useful Methods of communication have also changed, today, we use radio, television, newspapers, magazines, books, journals, to communicate with large groups. Also, powerful effects of pictures, painting, drawings, etching, graffitis which were not too strong in yesterday's communication have become part of modern day communication. International communication has improved, from the use of satellite technology in 20th century to worldwide web, to email and many other information technology devices have revolutionized communication and information transfer to sharing.

            "answer_text": "One could write a book on this good question. There are three ways humans are communicated with - sound, sight and touch. If we go back into the distant past before what we call language, there were sounds of language - they say vervet monkeys have a different cry for a snake, a leopard or an eagle to warn each other of exactly what predator is coming their way. The act of 'grooming' - some species of monkeys groom each other rifling through the hair - it finds the lice as well as communicates a social relationship. If humans started there, we've moved on from that starting point. There's debate among scholars of linguistics as to when and how humankind developed what we think of as language - the sounds we call words - but that was a change. Using rams' horns to call from hill to hill or smoke signals - that allowed for more distant communication. In England there were 'fire-keepers' - the northernmost of which kept watch for invasions from the north and lit a fire on his hill to warn the next who did the same and through lit fires on hills London learned a hostile human predator was coming their way.  The development of writing - symbols that represent sounds - or things - was another change. But once spoken language(s) were established and then writing on top of it - those were revolutions in human communication.Writing in stone vs. paper or clay tablet was somewhat of a different kind of communication - stone lets the message last longer. I may be skipping a step and I'm certainly skipping centuries - there were the bards whose work it was to take stories, tales and news from castle to castle. In the absence of radio, television and the Internet the bards broadcast the news of the day and put on a show as well.  Of course there's always the messenger - take this paper, clay tablet or stone to someone and have them read what it says or tell them what I said.  The printing press is a form of communication - it allowed more copies of a document to be made and in far less time. The printing press broadened communication and allowed for greater storage of records. We might have to ship centuries again to get to the telegraph, telephone, radio, and television and then finally to that which is the greatest communicator of all time. The invention of the computer and the Internet - and the Cloud - allow for the greatest data storage of all time and access to that data and has given us the most instantaneous communication. Those three taken together are all of it- they're the clay tablet, paper, etched in stone, messenger, bard, town crier, storyteller, carrier pigeon, writer, author, poet, news reporter all rolled together into one very powerful form of communication.

            "answer_text": "We have come a long way in the area of communication as a species. We have progressed from associating sounds with simple objects to being able to communicate complex ideas verbally and through symbols (writing). However, I think the real question is: how will we continue to revolutionize how we communicate?  Pioneering in futuristic ways of communicating with other human beings has become a billion -maybe trillion- dollar industry in the contemporary world. It has become a competition between some of the largest incorporations in the history of mankind as to who can offer the fastest, cheapest, and most novel form of communication. Over time, written languages have developed into a customary form of communication for most cultures. The newly founded internet has further firmly established that written language is here to stay, while at the same time reducing the use of speech between humans as communication. Is it possible that, in a century, verbal communication will be a thing of the past? Will a prodigy of the future discover a method of transmitting ideas directly from the mind of one person to another, eliminating the middle-man of physical communication? While it is impossible to answer these questions, one must ponder how communication will develop from this point in time on. ",

Boundaries are hard to understand or define more so than with verbal or in person communication. Just my thoughts. ",
