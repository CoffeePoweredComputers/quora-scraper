            "answer_text": "The first opium war was an attempt to stop foreign trade. Opium was legal in China but was grown in small quantities in Yunnan province, which made it too expensive for ordinary people. British traders bought tea, silk and other produce from China but sailed home with their boats empty because the Qing government refused to allow foreign imports. Eventually the Brits discovered a market for opium and that Manchu customs officials were willing to take bribes to allow it. As the price of opium fell, the use become more widespread and cases of addiction multiplied. The Qing Emperor decided to take action and sent Lin Zexiu to punish the foreigners. He confiscated all the opium in Canton and systematically destroyed it. The Brits responded by declaring war, which they won easily. They then demanded Hong Kong as a territory where they could live according to British law, rather than Qing law which they regarded as cruel and arbitrary. Hong Kong was then a sleepy fishing village but it grew into China\u2019s most prosperous city. When China closed itself again to foreign trade in the 1950s-70s, it developed industries like toy and watch manufacturing. The work force was powered by the many refugees who escaped from the famines in China caused by Mao\u2019s disastrous agricultural policies. In the 1980s, when the PRC opened to foreign trade and investment, one of the first steps was to create a Special Economic Zone within in the PRC on the border of Hong Kong, and most Hong Kong manufacturing relocated there. It became one of the PRC\u2019s most prosperous cities, Shenzhen. We could also talk about the second opium war and the development of Shanghai, but I\u2019ll leave that for another time. So the first opium war lead to Hong Kong and Shenzhen, and to the spread of trade, capitalism and economic development through China. Thus it was the trigger of the westernisation and industrialisation process which eventually resulted in the economic boom that is now bringing prosperity to China. Without the opium war, China would probably have carried on for another few hundred years as it was in those days. Manchu rulers were resistant to change and unwilling to adopt foreign technology, as it regarded everything Chinese as superior. It had ceased to create major new technological innovations, although there were many minor innovations which helped to boost agricultural productivity and allow the population to grow from 100 million to 400 million during the Qing dynasty. Women in Qing China were unable to participate fully in the work force as they were partially crippled by footbinding, which made it hard for them to walk. Qing China was set in its ways, and required an external shock such as opium war as the catalyst for change. Westernisation ended all this. One example of the resistance to change was the attitude to railways. The emperor refused to allow railway lines to be built and first railway line was purchased and torn up. But attitudes began to change as Chinese saw that westerners had more powerful economies and technologies, and the voices calling for westernisation grew steadily stronger. The Opium war was just one of a series of encroachments by foreign powers which gradually undermined the Manchu rule over Han China, leading eventually to the Xin Hai revolution. Qing China was a colony of the Manchus, a nomadic pastoral people closely related to the Mongols who lived in north east China. Under Manchu rule, Han Chinese were forced to grow long pig tales and the punishment for disobedience was death. The opium war was thus not just the catalyst for economic change but also for the revolution which ended Manchu colonisation of Han Chinese, and led to the liberation of women from footbinding and the prosperity we see today.

            "answer_text": "It is somewhat hard to say since the Opium wars more or less coincided with the massive Taiping rebellion (killed between 20 and 30 million people), droughts and more civil strife. In economic terms the positive effect was the introduction of new technologies but amidst the ruins of the Qing empire this did little to help the economy. Between 1800 and 1850 the GDP per capita was practically stagnant. The combined effect of all the calamities mentioned above was that the GDP per capita of China declined 12% between 1850 and 1870. The next thirty years between 1870 and 1900 saw a modest growth of 2.8% Between 1900 and 1930 the GDP per capita grew by 4.2% The next twenty years from 1930 to 1950 saw GDP per capita decline by 22% Only during the 1960s did the GDP per Capita rise above that of the year 1800.
