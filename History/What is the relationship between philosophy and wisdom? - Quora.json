            "answer_text": "Philosophy as we know is a particular way to be visionary very unique and for sure a gift that mother nature give to a specific branch of humanity. In this case the real Philosophers have this natural finess and introspective way to see thing , people , world directly from the soul. But if we are referring to people that they choose to persuit philosophy studies and resourches with passion and commitment but honestly and to be clear in my opinion the school is a great valuable tool for understand in deep way learning the history and tematic knowledge able to keep this treasure of the humanity alive. However at the end of accademic philosophy studies each student will absorb knowledge and the finest understanding of their mission as messanger of this sophisticated ancient culture without award the title of Philosopher. However as result they may excel in life while persuing other professional specializzation as teacher, lawiers,doctors,politicians and other high scale figures that with philosophy knowledge will be more easy tol excel in their own carriers. And now what the Wisdom have to do with Philosophy? Well, wisdom is a natural process that follow the evolution of all Philosophers that with life journey, age, human societal behaviors, the quality of having experience, knowledge of daily life and good understanding of the quality of being wise.
