In India, the Ancient Age ended and Middle Age started as Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni ended his domestic problems and started marching towards Kanauj, the centre of Indian glory. On the way he attacked and plundered Mathura and killed king Chandrapala that very year. What followed was long dominance of Turco-Persian rule in India, until the British won their first battle in 1757. Indians were doing fine on their own, as Chalukya king Durlabha attacked and plundered Lata.  The Holy Roman emperor Henry II sent an army towards West-Frisia (Holland) to subdue the rebellious Count Dirk III, who was not very nice to local bishops. The army met with disastrous consequences in the Battle of Vlaardingen.  Byzantine general Eustathios Daphnomeles invited Ibatzes, the leader of the Bulgarian resistance, to an man-o-man discussion. The general and his associates sprang on Ibatzes at the meeting, took out his eyes, packed him up, and abducted him by forcefully removing him from the premise. Emperor Basil II annexed Bulgaria that very year after this poor end of a 50-year long bitter struggle of the Bulgarians against the Byzantines.  In Cordoba Caliph Abd ar-Rahman IV had an even more interesting year as he went into battle against Cadiz. When he was fleeing the battle he was taken down and killed by the very people who put him on the throne that very year.  King Canute was having a more polite time up north, as he placed four English bishops in Ribe (Jutland), Odense (Funen), Roskilde (Zealand) and Lund (Sweden). His neighbour, king Malcom II of Scotland was not so modern in his ways of subjugation as he devastated Northumbrians at the Battle of Carham.  In the other end of the Eurasian continent, the Chinese Khitan kingdom launched an army of 100,000 soldiers against Goryeo kingdom of Korea. Goreyos answered with 208,000 soldiers. General Gang of the Goreyo used a river dam as his weapon of mass destruction. When he broke the dam the entire Khitan army drowned, leaving some 10,000 to go back home.  CNN would have been as big a hit 1000 years back. BONUS: The Comet in the Year 1018 ",
