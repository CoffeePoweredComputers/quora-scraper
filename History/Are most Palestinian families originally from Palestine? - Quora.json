            "answer_text": "No. My ancestors originate from near the Iraqi / Jordanian border. While part of my family started settling in what used to be called British Mandate Palestine, other parts of my family moved east to Baghdad. As children and young teenagers my paternal grandfather would tell me and my sister all kinds of lovely stories about his life, adventures, and businesses he used to own in Baghdad. One recurring topic was the exodus of Iraq\u2019s Jewish communities, which he always called a great national catastrophe and personal tragedy. Iraq\u2019s Jewish communities were one of the main import / export trading backbones and so when these communities disappeared their excellent trading connections and business relationships disappeared with them as well, as did much of the wealth they had generated and that helped sustain much of Iraqi society. This had the rather unfortunate side effect and consequence that many Arab companies, including my grandfather\u2019s companies, slowly but surely went out of business, because they depended to a large extent on the excellent trade relationships Iraq\u2019s Jewish communities had established and maintained for generations. My grandfather never had a bad word to say about the Jewish families with whom he did business. In fact he always told us they were the most fair, reliable, and trustworthy business people one could hope to call ones friends. To this very day my father and mother maintain that opinion and memory, because they are both old enough to remember Jordan\u2019s iron fist occupation of the West Bank and every subsequent conflict since then. They used to tell us stories about the nationalistic lunacy that spread like wildfire throughout the West Bank and eventually resulted in the creation of the PLO, which of course wasn\u2019t merely happy waging its ridiculous and bloody war of attrition against Israel, but also thought it wise and clever to publicly call for the overthrow of Jordan\u2019s Hashemite Monarchy. Thanks to the excellent, fair, and honest experiences my grandfather had enjoyed with the Jewish communities in Iraq, our grandparents and parents always trusted Israeli leaders more than our own, which is why we never fled and have always remained in more or less the same part of the West Bank in which our ancestors settled. Since I and my family believe in peaceful coexistence and normalisation with liberal and pluralist Israel, we don\u2019t see any reason why we should have to return to Jordan. However, we can understand why many Israelis think that way. Our Arab and Palestinians leaders have steadfastly refused to accept anything and everything ever offered to them that didn\u2019t first and foremost include the eradication of all the Jews in what used to be known as British Mandate Palestine. When Anwar Sadat eventually and very bravely made peace with Israel he was assassinated by Muslim fanatics who later on went on to attack the USA in the first World Trade Center bombing of 1993. Our Palestinian leaders have never been interested in peace with Israel or the West for that matter. As already mentioned above, the PLO even thought it a good idea to try and topple and wage war against Jordan\u2019s Hashemite Monarchy in 1970, which didn\u2019t exactly work out too well for us either. While our Arab leaders were either fighting each other or trying to exterminate Israel, Israelis made the desert bloom, fought off countless attacks against overwhelming odds, and have made their country into the world\u2019s most successful, liberal and pluralist high-tech startup nation. Meanwhile history has spoken and we Palestinians still keep running full speed ahead and fully armed towards the wrong side of history, which these days is nothing more than an impenetrable concrete wall / wire fence that wouldn\u2019t need to divide anything or anybody, if it were not so necessary and successful keeping Israelis safe from our relentlessly murderous Palestinian terrorist attacks. Over the past couple of weeks Palestinian and Israeli women have marched together for peace only to be denounced by both Hamas and the BDS movement (that ironically enough always claims to be in favour of peace and against terrorism, yet clearly prefers siding with murderous Islamic terrorists instead of harmless female peace activists). It\u2019s time for Israeli and Western liberals to realise Israeli politicians on both the right and left side of the political spectrum can continue offering peace to our Palestinian leaders as much and often as they like, safe in the knowledge our Palestinian leaders will always and forever turn down every single offer, regardless of how generous it is, unless it includes the destruction of the State of Israel and the exodus of all Jews. That said, hope dies last, as they say. For what little it\u2019s worth, I and my wife hope for the sake of all children and grandchildren on both sides of the divide that peace is in the offing - sooner rather than later. ------ If you liked my answer or comment, please be so kind and \u201eUpvote\u201c it and also consider following me. The more public support and followers I receive, the safer it is (in theory at least) for me here in the West Bank to speak my mind as freely as possible and advocate for peaceful coexistence and normalisation between our two people. Thank you most kindly, Muhammad Ibrahim Hussein & family. ",

            "answer_text": "First, it does not matter who local Arabs descend from. Indigenity is defined by cultural affiliation & a Time Meter. The earliest extant culture on the land is the indigenous culture. Jewish Culture is pre-invasive. In fact, when the very first Arab stepped into history IN ARABIA \u2014 in 853 BCE- Jews had a sovereign state nearly 5-centuries old. When Arabs first invaded \u2014 in 634 CE- Jews had 2,000-continuous years on the land, of which 1,100 were fully sovereign. That Jewish Culture predates Arab Culture by 2 millenia makes the issue almost comical. Arabs claim to have been present on the land when Jews invaded from the Jordanian-side of the river. They do not explain why noone in Antiquity ever mentions other groups existing upon the land after 800 BCE. The Phillistines were extinct by then as were the various Canaanite Tribes. As for the Phillistines, the group that Palestinians & some of their supporters focus upon, as \"Palestinian\" Is after all the Greek bastardisation of the label \"Phillistine\" \u2014 they were Proto Greek invaders from the Aegaean isles off of Greece. Their culture was Mycanaean and centered upon the island of Crete. Local Arabs claim to be European invaders while simultaneoudly pointing their finger at Israelis, whom they usually insist are...\"European invaders.\" Kafkaesque does not begin to describe it. Need to add, other answers neglected a couple of points. The first is that the only details we have of the three Jewish Roman Wars come to us from Roman propagandists. Even Josephus, the Jewish traitor who defected to Rome was a highly biased propagandist. D-o Cassius? Tacitus? They all primarily relied upon word of mouth gossip to come up with their figures. In the 7th Century CE the last pre modern Jewish State \u2014 the Sassanian Jewish Commonwealth \u2014 fell just 20-months before the Arabs invaded. In order to re-establish Jewish sovereignity over all of the land there had to be a sizable & stable number of Jews living upon the land. Galilee, Golan & much of Judaea still had a population that was mostly Jewish, Even after the Arab invasion Jews remained the majority in Galilee until the late-18th Century. Likewise in Golan until the 1830s. Unfortunately, they did not remain so in Judaea after the Second Crusade. Still, in Jerusalem they have always held a solid majority except during periodic bans on Jewish residency. Palestinians are of course Arabs. Every Palestinian Tribe & clan are part of the Qais- Yamani Confederacies. They speak Arabic as a first language and would never dare to claim that they do not practice Arab Culture. Since Arabs first arrived on the land as invaders, Palestinians practice an invasive culture. Even If they could somehow sell the fantasy that they are the descendents of Phillistines & Cana'anites, their invasive culture abrogates any indigenous status. Lastly, depending upon the study you choose, 6 to 8% of Palestinians are in fact the direct descendents of Jews & the closely-related Samaritans. Those directly descended from Jews cluster in Hebron District in Judaea. Those descending from Samaritans cluster in Nablus District in Samaria. As noted, that still doesn't make them indigenous, but invaders. ",

Despite the \u2018tongue in cheek\u2019 title, the link provides a list of common Palestinian family names and their ethnic origins. I regard \u2018Palestinian\u2019 as a political, rather than ethnic identifier. Pretending to be Canaanites or Philistines only undermines their credibility. Lots of countries are populated by people of assorted ethnic backgrounds. It shouldn\u2019t be an issue. \"Zionists trying to hide Canaanite-Palestinian civilization\" I think the issue is only relevant if you are trying to give the impression that you have more rights to a place than the other guy. In this case, the other guy is Israel, and by the standard the Palestinians are trying to use (history vs mythology) the Israelis win. Archeology and history prove it. Additionally, genetic studies place the origins of Palestinians outside the Levant. Genome-Wide Diversity in the Levant Reveals Recent Structuring by Culture Again, while it\u2019s interesting and debunks their ethnic origin claim, it\u2019s still largely irrelevant to creating a viable Palestinian state. Negotiate borders, make a state, and get on with it. Unless the real motive of the Palestinians isn\u2019t a 2-State solution at all. ",

            "answer_text": "Anonymous brings the data of population growth in what used to be the province of Palestine and claims that there is no foundation to the thesis that there was any form of massive Arab migration before the establishment of Israel.I disagree on four counts:1. There is no explanation for the sudden doubling and then quadrupling of the Arab population between 1923 and 1947. It couldn\u2019t be natural because the main driver for decreasing infant mortality and increased life expectancy has always been medical treatment and in particular the advent of antibiotics which were only introduced to the first world countries in 1939. 2. Historically the area has always been one of migrations. During the Ottoman rule and even more so under the British mandate, especially in the turbulent post WW II world.3. Much as Muhammad Ibrahim Hussein describes, most of today\u2019s Israeli Arabs and Palestinians in the Occupied territories have family connections throughout the Middle East. Jordan, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon mostly. I\u2019m not referring to the refugee camps but to well established families thriving throughout the Arab middle east.4. The first buds of the Palestinian National Movement around the early 1920\u2019s identified with the pan-Arab notion of a greater Syria and not with a distinct Palestinian nation-state. That came much later and to a great extent as a reaction to Zionism. This of course has nothing to do with the fact that Palestinians today identify themselves as a national identity. I don\u2019t argue with self determination. I do argue with the reinvention of historical facts. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a problem with the definition used to define a Palestinian refugee. The definition the UN set up when they established the UNRWA was any person who lived in the British Mandate of Palestine a minimum of 3 years prior to the establishment of the State of Israel. So someone could have moved to the British Mandate in 1945 from Egypt, Jordan, Iran, wherever, and then claimed refugee status in 1949. Furthermore, Palestinian refugees are the only refugee group where the status passes on in each generation. So even children of Palestinian refugees born outside the country inherit their parent's status. And there is no limit to how many generations it can be passed down. So the numbers grow at the rate of population growth. When you combine that with how Jordan, Egypt and Syria have established that the Palestinians who have been living in their refugee camps have restricted travel, an incredibly hard time to actually become citizens in that country and cannot own property in certain areas, the problem perpetuates itself.

Turns out he was the Well man, who kept the wells clean, in Somerset England. Another ancestor, I was told, was a Native American. She was always called \u2018the Indian.\u201d Turns out, she was from Indiana, and not an Indian. The same can be true of some Palestinian names, whom Israelis chose to interpret as indicating they are from other countries and not Palestinian. Its possible that a thousand years ago, some one did come from Egypt into Palestine. Abraham was a Chaldean from Ur and not an Israeli. ",

I don't know of any person that identifies as a Palestinian who's family is not originally from the region that is now Israel,  the West Bank, and Gaza. Many Palestinian families have not lived there for a generation or more, having been part of the 750,000 Palestinians expelled in 1948, or the second wave in 1967. But they trace their families to the region, often grandparents or parents, and in my experience most can tell you the name of the town or village their family was from.  There is no evidence that most Palestinians are not from the region, though there have been claims made by some political partisans, most notably the discredited book \"From Time Immemorial\" which claimed most Palestinians were recent immigrants to the Mandate of Palestine. That claim has been credibly debunked by numerous historians and demographers, including Israeli ones.  ",

            "answer_text": "Many Palestinian families and most Israeli families aren\u2019t from Palestine. By saying originally from, we are implying natives of the land. Many Palestinians came from the Levantine and North African regions, and most Israelis today are of European descent. Most Palestinians you see today have been there for hundreds and thousands of years though, many of whom converted from Judaism to Christianity and Islam. The large Jewish population, that makes up most of Israel\u2019s population, come from Europe as there was a mass migration of Jews after WWII. There had also been migration of Jews from countries such as Yemen, Algeria, and Iraq. You can usually tell if someone is a native by them having a mix of Middle Eastern DNA and possibly slight \u201cJewish\u201d DNA. Palestine has been invaded time and time again throughout history so it\u2019s sort of a mixing bowl of people from different places. For example, you had the Romans, the Ottomans, etc\u2026 the only way to really tell if someone is an actual native is through their DNA and family history. ",

The Ottomans were not very diligent about taking census data, and when they did, people had an incentive to fudge the numbers to avoid taxes.  While it's known there was significant Arab immigration during the time of British rule, the brits didn't keep track of it so it's unknown how extensive it was.  It is known that prior to the 20th century the region was described as desolate and sparsely populated.   It is also known that of the Arabic refugees from the Israeli war of independence, called the \"Nakba\" by some, those that tried to return to homes in places such as Egypt, Iraq, Syria or Lebanon were turned away and not allowed to return and had Palestinian identity forced upon them.

Jews took back their historic homeland in geographic Palestine, named it the State of Israel, built a vast culture and infrastructure, and has the means and willpower to defend it from invaders. Arabs had the right to take (roughly) half of Palestine for a nation of their own when the Mandate ended, but chose war instead\u2014unwisely, to utter dismay.

The Arabs were offered the same as Israel back then BUT they decided it was theirs and no Israel it was all or nothing. Jordan was also created and the surrounding Arab countries refused to accept any of the Arabs so War broke out between Israel and the Arabs and Israel was established. The Arabs continually start wars trying to wipe out Israel but lose every time. The 1967 Six Day War was started by Israel only because the Arab Nations were arming themselves and getting ready for an all out attack on Israel so Israel attacked first and won. This was when Israel took East Jerusalem and and claimed the whole city as Israel. The PLO was a political party of the Arabs. ",
