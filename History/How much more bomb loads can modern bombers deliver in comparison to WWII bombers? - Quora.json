            "answer_text": "B-17 American heavy bomber of WWII: 8,000 pounds maximum. B-29 even heavier American bomber of WWII: 20,000 pounds maximum. Contemporary B-52 heavy American bomber: 70,000 pounds maximum. Contemporary Tu-160 supersonic heavy Russian bomber: 99,000 pounds maximum. Contemporary newer B-2 supersonic heavy American bomber: 50,000 pounds maximum. F-15 contemporary American multi-role fighter jet: 16,000 pounds on hard points. F-35 contemporary newer American multi-role fighter jet: 18,000 pounds total including hard points. As you can see, contemporary fighter planes carry the same bomb load as WWII heavy bombers. Even more importantly, if a contemporary bomb is dropped, it will hit its target most of the time, far more than could be said of any WWII bomb. ",
