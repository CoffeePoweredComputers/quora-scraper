            "answer_text": "One factor dealt Reconstruction the final death blow: the election of 1876. Lincoln\u2019s 1865 pledge, \u2018With malice towards none; with charity towards all.\u2019 died with him. In the ten plus years after the war, it was politics as usual. Republicans owed President Andrew Johnson nothing. They had paid their debt to humanity by freeing the slaves and had little stomach for doing any more than that. One question: Reconstruct what? The South was an occupied territory, administered by the U.S. Army. Hordes of Carpetbaggers, Northerners so eager to reap the profits of federal aid, were so eager to get southward that they stuffed their belongings into carpetbag-looking suitcases. Indigenous white men, called Scalawags, believed they could profit as well. The freedmen were caught in the middle. Someone had promised them \u2018forty acres and a mule\u2019, but that never happened either. Dirt-poor farmers might grow crops, but the transportation system, roads and rail, had been destroyed in the war. Enter into this legal and greedy morass were the Confederate soldiers returning home to a desolate landscape. Life was bitter for almost everyone below the Mason-Dixon line. Whites formed vigilante groups to protect against the threat of the freedmen. Blacks felt the government in Washington had betrayed them. Commercial areas had been bombed flat and there was no \u2018reconstruction\u2019 money to rebuild. The election of 1876 was tight. Samuel Tilden, a Democrat, won a majority of the certified electoral votes. But he was one vote shy of the magic majority number. Rutherford B. Hayes, the Republican, would have to win all twenty of the contested votes in the House of Representatives. A deal was struck: Hayes gets the White House and Yankee troops get out of the South. Reconstruction was a failure because, despite freeing the Black man, it did not protect or support him. The central government failed to assist in rebuilding (Reconstruction??) the South. Greed, racism, sectionalism and cruelty won. Were there gains? Of course. The francise was extended to the former slaves, Black men were elected to Congress, cotton markets grew, newspapers published, southern cities established public libraries and people were free to travel. Some folks moved westward. Urban cities like Atlanta and Richmond rebuilt as they could. Fortunes could be made in new industries. Were the above-mentioned improvements enough? No. ",

            "answer_text": "The purpose of reconstruction was to \u201ccleanse\u201d the governments of the states which had seceded and bring them back into the union. In that sense, it succeeded. The reason it took so long and was so painful was Lincoln\u2019s death. He had been the unifying force of the administration. With him gone, the federal government was split between those who wanted to punish the southern states and those who wanted to bring the nation back together. Evidence of this is easily seen in the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. It failed (in the Senate) by a single vote. ",
