            "answer_text": "We know approximately when each pharaoh reigned during the Late Bronze Age, so all we need to do is establish when and if these events occurred, and we will know the name of the pharaoh. During the relevant period the following pharaohs reigned in Egypt: \u00b7 Amenhotep I (1526\u20131506)\u00b7 Thutmose I (1506\u20131493)\u00b7 Thutmose II (1493\u20131479 BCE)\u00b7 Hatshepsut (1473\u20131458)\u00b7 Thutmose III (1479\u20131425)\u00b7 Amenhotep II (1427\u20131401)\u00b7 Thutmose IV (1401 \u2013 1391)\u00b7 Amenhotep III (1391\u20131353)\u00b7 Akhenaten (1353\u20131336)\u00b7 Smenkhkare (1335-1334)\u00b7 Neferneferuaten (1334\u20131332)\u00b7 Tutankhamun (1332\u20131323). Ay (1323\u20131319)\u00b7 Horemheb (? -1292)\u00b7 Ramesses I (1292\u20131290)\u00b7 Seti I (1290\u20131279)\u00b7 Ramesses II (1279\u20131213)\u00b7 Merneptah (1213-1203) 1 Kings 6:1 tells us: the Exodus occurred 480 years before the fourth year of King Solomon\u2019s reign, which, based on biblical chronology, would meant that the Exodus took place approximately 1440 BCE. However, that date is entirely impossible because the Amarna letters tell us conclusively that Canaanite petty kings still ruled their cities later than 1350 BCE, under total Egyptian domination. Not only had they not been defeated by the Israelites, anyone fleeing from Egypt would be fleeing to an area controlled by the Egyptian army and Egyptian allies. The reference to the city of pi-Ramses, named after Ramesses II, means that any date before, say, 1250 BCE is not possible. The Merneptah stele does mention Merneptah and the Israelites, but only in the context of Merneptah sweeping through the Canaanite region and defeating Canaanite cities and wiping out (he thought) the Israelite people he discovered there (\u201cIsrael is laid waste and his seed is not\u201d). This stele tells us three important facts: By the late thirteenth century, Canaanites still occupied their cities;Israelites were already present in the region, but appear not to have had any significant citiesOn this evidence, Ramesses II is the only pharaoh who could fit the biblical narrative, because at least the city of pi-Ramses existed and because the Merneptah stele seems to exclude Merneptah. However, we know that Ramesses II died as a very old man and was mummified, so could not have been the pharaoh who pursued the Israelites and was drowned in the sea. With no direct or indirect reference in the Egyptian records to the Israelites or to Moses, we should look further at the archaeological record to see whether these events really happened, before nominating Ramesses II as the pharaoh of Exodus. The distinguished Israeli archaeologist, Israel Finkelstein says that over 90 per cent of scholars believe there was no Exodus from Egypt as described in the Bible. With no Exodus and therefore no Moses, we do not need to find a pharaoh to fit our story. ",

            "answer_text": "Amenhotep II. We actually do not have accurate chronology by Egypt with three different reign lengths for him. However one of his reign lengths puts him in the exodus around 1446 B.C. And he makes most sense since: (1) He was not the first born of his predecessor and his successor was not the first born (2) He fits actual biblical chronology rather than silly emphases on Pi-Ramses which is a clear indicator of editorial updating as is common for Genesis and Exodus. (3) He led hardly any military campaigns compared to his predecessor Thutmose III who was one of strongest pharaoh's of the New Kingdom. (4) His 2nd military campaign right after the Exodus date with his matching reign length ended with him capturing over 100,000 POWs for future slaves and 1,082 new chariots. Such booty numbers are unattested in any other military campaign even all 17 by his father. Now (5) The Amarna Letters prove the exact opposite. First Joshua does NOT narrate a total Conquest of Canaan contrary to the delusions and clear presuppositions of other answerers. And in Judges, the writer outright admits the Israelites failed to conquer their \"allotments\" in Joshua. Indeed, all Joshua-Judges portray at best is: the Israelites destroyed but did not occupy three cities, Jericho, Ai, and Hazor. They had successful battles against local Canaanite kings initially under Joshua. Then by Joshua's death (1350 B.C?) the Israelites continued to war with their neighbors but ultimately failed and settled among them for centuries until the monarchy. And with that...the Amarna Letters are PROOF. The Egyptians were NOT MAINTAINING many of their Canaanite vassals as the letters prove demanding military help by Egypt that never came. An entire new Amurru (Amorite) Kingdom emerged for a few decades in Canaan with no Egyptian response to it beyond begging Aziru (its new king after Rib-Habba governor of Byblos was killed and he was serving Egypt and begging for help constantly) to stay with Egypt but...nope..he broke ties. Indeed, Egypt was LOSING CANAAN during this time! And when Egypt ever decided to conduct campaigns into Canaan they always campaigned in the lowlands not the highlands which is where the Israelites settled according to Joshua-Judges. So don't listen to this crap that the Amarna Letters somehow disprove the traditional chronology. They actually prove it because in addition to portraying Canaan as an unstable entity during this time where new kingdoms were able to emerge in the ashes (Amurru), the Canaanite rulers also mention routinely a new Semitic group pillaging their cities, forming alliances, and is actually the MAIN group they talk about most called Habiru. Regardless whether Habiru must always mean Israelites specifically (it doesn't have too), the fact is it CAN and given the context it's absurd to deny no connection. With that said, here is my detailed answer with sources on the Exodus-Conquest in general: Ben Stevens's answer to What evidence is there to support or contradict the biblical story of the Exodus? ",

            "answer_text": "There are many Pharaohs who fit the bill, but I am inclined to believe David Rohl\u2019 s theory about Dudimose I. He has an excellent video on YouTube called The Biblical Exodus... Fairytale or Historical Fact? (by David Rohl) I tried to post a link but it\u2019s not working. While I find this extremely plausible there\u2019s another theory that\u2019s even more plausible but is not well-known, and that theory is that the Pharaoh of the Exodus was the the son of Pepi II. You see, there\u2019s a Jewish book called Sefer HaYashar that names the Pharaoh( though it doesn\u2019t give his Egyptian name) and more importantly, it says that the Pharaoh of the Oppression ruled for 94 years and his son, the Pharaoh of the Exodus, ruled for four. Well, what do you know? We have a Pharaoh that ruled for 94 years, that being Pepi II, and his son ruled for four years after! There\u2019s an excellent video on YouTube about this but the link isn\u2019t working so just type in pharaoh of the exodus jim long. It\u2019s over an hour but he doesn\u2019t get to the Sefer Ha Yashar until about 50 minutes in so you can just skip until there. Here is the link to a great article that discusses this. https://digitalcommons.cedarville.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1011&context=icc_proceedings It would be awesome if those of us on Quora can finally say for sure who the Pharaoh of the Exodus was by taking all Biblical evidence and all archaeological evidence and putting it all together into one coherent narrative.

But that doesn't fit the Egyptological knowledge that he died twenty odd years later.Inscriptions from Thutmose III's reign record him plundering the very area that the Israelites were supposedly fleeing to.None of the events described in Exodus such as the 10 plagues are mentioned in the extant Egyptian records of Thutmose III (or any other Egyptian records) either.",

Seemingly the majority of the secular (not influenced by their own religion) historians and archaeologists concerned with the history of ancient Egypt haven't found any evidence of any of the events of the Old Testament. There is no credible evidence for the enslavement of the Israelites, which is weird, since the Egyptians kept track of all the people they enslaved and since it would have also been a notable event. The claims made in the Bible and Jewish scripture, I'm afraid, are nothing more than fiction. They may very well be influenced by reality, the Egyptians definitely were in the habit of enslaving neighboring peoples, but the specific situation of the Israelites being enslaved and then escaping doesn't seem to be supported by much historical evidence.

However, new evidence and recent discoveries have suggested that the standard Egyptian chronology may be off by centuries. There is an archeological pattern that fits the Biblical account of the Exodus in the Middle Kingdom, just before the Hyksos invasion. Amenhotep II is a good candidate. For more info I would highly recommend the works of David Rohl. ",
