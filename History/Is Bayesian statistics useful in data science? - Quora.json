            "answer_text": "Useful for Kaggle and useful for real life are not synonymous, as Justin Veenstra points out. However, Bayesian approaches have in fact been essential to winning Kaggle solutions. One of the most challenging, highest profile contests was the Observing Dark Worlds contest, where contestants were challenged to detect dark matter floating through the universe: 1st Place: Observing Dark Worlds If you are interested in a very practical, applied treatment of Bayesian methods, I highly recommend Cameron-Davidson Pilon\u2019s Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers: Bayesian Methods for Hackers Chapter 5 in Pilon\u2019s book contains a complete solution in Python to the aforementioned Dark Worlds Kaggle contest: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Chapter5_LossFunctions/Chapter5.ipynb For problems of prediction, where we are primarily interested in predictive accuracy (such as a Kaggle contest), Bayesian approaches really shine when we are limited in the amount of data at our disposal. Small data is in some ways tougher than big data; being able to incorporate priors becomes very useful with a small N! ",

Or at least does not usually consist of the kind of problem one would solve in real life work in data science. Depending on the kind of problems you solve and what you have to solve them, Bayesian statistics can be very useful indeed in real life. ",
