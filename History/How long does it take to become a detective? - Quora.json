            "answer_text": "It very much depends on the department. There are many variables to consider. Some agenc will promote an Officer to Detectiv based on merit and the individuals natural talent for investigative type work. An officer could still be moderately new to the job but if that officer shows a knack for solving cases and has obvious talent they may be made Detective early in their caree. This is of course weather or not they serve at the pleasure of the Chief or Sheriff of that agency. In a department like SFPD it is still based on old Civil Service Exam System. Example would be a Job Announcement would be posted with minumum qualifications and exam date etc\u2026Usualy it would require the Officer have a certain amount of years on the job as a Patrolmen, maybe 3 years at least depending on education level, Veterans Points etc\u2026 They will post the exam date and any officers who meet the minumum qualifications may take the test for the rank of Detective or Inspector as we call it here in San Francisco. Then it comes down to who gets the highest scores and number of job positions available. Throw in some dubious politics for good measure and wait for the Exam Scores to be posted. In some agencies the rank of Detective may be temporary and one could be sent back to Patrol after a certain amount of years as a Investigator. There really are so many variables depending on the specific department and how they approach their promotional system. Also many large urban departments like NYPD, LAPD etc\u2026 usually overseen by a civilian Police Commission or the City Government itself and they may have authority over how promotional systems should work. Each system has its flaws. The exam system could have an Officer who scores very high but has no real talent for Police Work when applied in real life on the street. Some people are great test takers but not necessarily good cops. When the rank is appointed based on merit the door is opened for favoritism and personal relationships influencing the promotions. Most agencies would require that an Officer have at least a few years Patrol experience on the street before considering the rank of Detective. We were taught early on that it generally takes the average cop 7 years to really become proficient at the overall job of Police Officer. I have found that to be fairly accurate in most cases. I personally believe an Officer should have a good amount of General Patrol experience before moving into any type of specialized job. Sadly that is not the case anymore. College degrees are starting to take the place of real life job experience which can be dangerous. Nothing wrong with a good education but that does not necessarily mean anything at all on the street. A Bachelor Degree will not stop a hardened convict from knocking you out cold with a cheapshot. Having real life experience, Military, Sports, Martial Arts etc\u2026 could save you. The old school prison hardened criminals can read cops pretty well. They know quickly who is tough and confident and who is scared and can be bullied. They're good at reading the body language. These street guys tend to be less inclined to test an Officer who is not afraid to take a punch if need be. If they see you are a young scared Nerd who has never been in a fight then they will absolutely bully and test you. Its like schoolyard bullshit but it really happens that way. Sorry for changing directions there and I hope I answered your original question somewhat\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "It varies greatly from agency to agency... However, there are some basics that are pretty uniform. After graduating from high school, a four year degree from a college or university in a field such as criminal justice, administration or justice or another related field would be appropriate. Others will join the military and try to get their MOS as an MP. This can also give you experience future employers may desire. A fair number of agencies today require college degrees for employment and many more prefer them when climbing the promotional ranks. Either route you go, you can expect about 4 years of college or military experience. You can then expect about another 6 months of going through the employment process. That being the entrance exam, the physical fitness assessment, the polygraph exam, a healthy screening, psychological evaluation and then a lengthy background investigation. All of this takes about 6 months to complete before you are hired. Many times you will be hired but will have to wait anywhere from a couple weeks to several months for the next academy to start. Often you will do ride-a-longs, assist with clerical work or other non sworn duties while you wait for the academy to start. The academy I attended for my police department was then 6 months long. From there I was sworn in but had to go through another 3 month of field training with a field training instructor or FTI. At that point you're \"cut loose\" and on your own. Different departments have different requirements but mine requires 2 years of being a patrolman before you can apply for a specialty, and detectives are considered specialties. Becoming a detective is not an easy process and rarely is an officer promoted to detective with 2 years on. Most officers build their experience in patrol for at least 3-5 years. Then move on to become a bike officer, school resource officer or other specialty that is less competitive but where they can build their investigative skills. Eventually through your experience and further training with your department you have the skills to become a detective. There is usually what they call a process. It can often require some sort of written exam, an oral review board where the supervisor of a detective unit and other detectives will interview you and you will often be required to submit previous cases you've written to show your abilities. Also, they will look at previous evaluations you received from your supervisor. Should you have good experience, several good cases you worked well documented in reports you've written, sought out and took classes as in service with your department related to interview/interrogation, investigations etc, have good past evaluations, do well on the written exam and the oral board, you have a great shot of getting a detective position. My department has station level detectives. They work simple felonies like burglaries and grand larcenies. Then there are department wide detectives who work out of the major crimes section. These detectives work in specialty areas such as stolen auto, fugitive squad, sex crimes and homicide. Obviously, homicide detectives are the apex and are the most senior and skilled detectives. All in all expect this: 4 years of education or previous job experience(remember you must be at least 21 to be a law enforcement officer). 6 months for the hiring process. 6 months for the academy. 3-5 years of experience as a patrol officer or other specialty position. Add that up, you're looking at 8 years minimum time from high school to being a low level detective and perhaps 15 years plus to being the \"coveted\" homicide detective. Best of luck in your endeavor! You can also visit Veteran Investigation Services (VIS) for more related information and knowledge. ",
