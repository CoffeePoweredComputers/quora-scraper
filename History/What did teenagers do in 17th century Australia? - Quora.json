            "answer_text": "Generally it is thought that the majority of teenage Australians in the 17 century were engaged in hunter gatherer activities. I understand there is evidence of fixed agricultural sites to take advantage of plentiful freshwater fish and shellfish but I do not know if they were active during the 17C or were considered ancient structures by that time. There were also industrial sites creating specialist tools and implements used for trade along the extensive trade routes throughout the many counties in the continent. Teenagers would all have been involve in these activities. In their early teens all would have under gone traditional coming of age ceremonies and been indoctrinated into the the lore traditions and Fealty\u2019s of their clan/ tribe/mob and be considered a young adult. Along with the advantages of being considered an adult were the obligations. Family was important, stories were important because of their direct consequences to survival sharing trade and traditions were important. Survival was of paramount importance I am not an expert on the pre western colonizations societies of Australia but this should you a broad(But limited) idea. I am more than happy to read about other research or traditional histories of what teenagers (young adults) got up to ",

Life expectancy was half what it is in modern times. People died in their late 30's or 40's. Many children died before they were 10. Many people did not go to school at all. As soon as they were able they were given a job that contributed to the family. People got married in their teens. There was no birth control. Life was very different in the 1600's. ",
