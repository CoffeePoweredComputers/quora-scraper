Burrows, Mike Wallace: 9780195140491: Amazon.com: Books The Power Broker, by Robert Caro, details the life of Robert Moses who played an outsize role in the transformation of New York City in the 20th Century, and consequently there\u2019s a lot of history in there. The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York by Robert A. Caro (1974-07-12): Amazon.com: Books I really like The Big Oyster by Mark Kurlansky. Mark is a \u201cfood historian\u201d (my term) and this book is about the oysters that were once more plentiful in New York harbor than anywhere else in the world. But even though it\u2019s about oysters, it ends up being quite an informative history of New York in the second half of the 19th Century. The Big Oyster: Mark Kurlansky: 9780224078238: Amazon.com: Books Finally, I have a book called the Historical Atlas of New York City. I love it, and reference it all the time.
