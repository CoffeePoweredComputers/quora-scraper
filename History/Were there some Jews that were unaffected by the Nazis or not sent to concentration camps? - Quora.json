            "answer_text": "It\u2019s difficult to imagine that anybody of Jewish faith wasn\u2019t affected in some way or other. However, there were some who didn\u2019t end up in a concentration camp for a variety of reasons (usually because they were under the personal protection of a powerful person - even some of the top Nazi leaders had Jewish lovers). But such existence would have been extremely stressful: fear of denunciation, or being abandoned by the former protector, and so on. There also were a few people who received help from ordinary German citizens who didn\u2019t share the extreme views of their leaders. Sadly, those helpers were not as common as one might have hoped for and often didn\u2019t receive recognition after the war (often for reasons of modesty or because they never expected any thanks or recognition in the first place). One case with which I was personally acquainted: a Jewish jeweler had his tools and stock kept by a family in Freiburg who buried the treasure in a difficult to reach place. The jeweler himself went underground in a small village of the Schwarzwald, where former Communists supported him (fed him, gave him a safe place to hide out, provided warmth in winter, and so on). After the war, the jeweler made contact with the family in Freiburg and, to his surprise, discovered that his tools and valuables were still buried, untouched and undiminished. He started a new business and offered the family a partnership, which they rejected. The only practical reward they received (and accepted) was that the jeweler did some free work for them - I was personally present when a wrist watch (at the time a valued possession) was repaired free of charge (and that only because the jeweler refused the offered payment). So, yes, there were \u201cgood Germans\u201d, even if post-war mythology all but denied their existence. ",

            "answer_text": "Not affected at all is a strong statement to make of course. Probably there were few such people among those Jews who were alive at the time. One third of the worldwide Jewish population died, so there would be relatively few Jewish people living then who had no relatives at all who were killed or affected by the Nazis. Were there some Jews who were not sent to concentration camps or shot out in the woods? Yes, certainly there were, even among European Jews, among whom the death rate was closer to two in three. There were people who got out, people who escaped capture, people who were hidden, people who fought with partisans or with the Soviet Army, and there was the whole population who had emigrated long before the War, to Canada, US, South America, Britain, Palestine and so forth and so on. None of those who emigrated early and who stayed away went to concentration camps. One half of the world\u2019s Jewish population, speaking very roughly, was in Europe in 1933, and one half was outside. Where exactly you were when the Nazis marched in made all the difference. The death rates in Poland and Ukraine were horrendous, as they were in Latvia and Lithuania. But Estonian and Finnish Jews mostly survived the War. Romania was horrific the Romanian Government organized the deportation of Jews from Bessarabia and Bukovina to Transnistria on its own where they were killed together with the Jews of Odessa and Roma who had been deported too. Byelorus saw mass killings by the Einsatzgruppen. But many Russian Jews survived. Bulgarian Jews all survived. Greek Jews didn\u2019t do as well. Half of Dutch Jews died, half survived, and it was similar for Hungarian Jews. Most Italian Jews survived. France was worse. Wealthy German Jews emigrated before the war, poorer ones were either stuck or they went to France or Czechoslovakia, which was mostly of no help. If you could escape from Vichy France to Spain there was at least a chance you could survive in Spain. All Danish Jews except the very old and sick survived. The Danish resistance took anyone willing and able to make the trip out to Sweden, where the King had agreed to give all the Danish Jews permanent residence. But none of these people were unaffected by Nazis. ",
