            "answer_text": "Before and after D Day intelligence for the allies was vital. Troop movements, troop positions, Also blowing bridges and general delaying troop movement to reinforce the beaches in Normandy. In the days leading up to D-Day, German forces in Normandy outnumbered the Allied troops massing for the invasion, so it was also critical for the French Resistance to prevent German reinforcements from reaching the beaches. Most notably, Germany\u2019s powerful SS 2nd Panzer Division was based in Toulouse, a city in the Languedoc province of southwest France. Disruption of the rail line prevented this important division from reaching Normandy for eleven days, giving the Allies time to establish the beachhead that would enable them to advance further into the countryside after the invasion. French Resistance members remained active participants, giving American and British military commanders vital information about German defensive positions. Even French citizens who weren\u2019t involved in the Resistance movement gave directions to the Allies and kept them informed about where the German troops were posted. Nazi retaliation against the Resistance was swift and brutal. On June 9, 1944, there were hundreds of hangings and murders at the hands of the Germans. The next day, 642 men, women, and children in the village of Oradour-sur-Glane were slaughtered, and the village was burned. Still, the Resistance fought on. In June and July, a group of maquis fought valiantly against a battalion of 10,000 German soldiers and was defeated, and when the Allies marched toward Paris and the south of France, the Resistance was by their side. Even with the high price paid by so many Resistance members, its numbers continued to strengthen. From within its ranks grew an organized fighting force known as the French Forces of the Interior (FFI) that, by October 1944, grew to 400,000. It was the base from which France rebuilt its army to 1.2 million soldiers by VE Day (May 8, 1945). And all because of people whose acts of bravery weren\u2019t inspired by dreams of glory. Rather, they were ordinary people living at an extraordinary time, who circumstances called upon to help reclaim their country. So yes the french resistance was vital to the success of D Day and the eventual liberation of western Europe. Also i might add there are many cases of resistance fighter taking on the Germans in pitched battles even though they were hopelessly outnumbered. ",
