            "answer_text": "I feel that while you are right, you are also wrong in your examples. Games of the past (once their novelty had faded) had to have either interesting stories or amazing gameplay to be interesting; there was no substitute for either, and for the most part that is what they would be judged for. However, as graphics became better and better, artists began spending more and more time on that, and consequently, less on other aspects of the game. So now, innovations are less likely and making a Call of Duty or Elder-Scrolls (obviously these aren't the only examples, they are what came to mind) clone with generic enemies is good enough that it will sell, while if a great, new, innovative game did not spend as much money in art, it has little chance of outperforming the more visually detailed game. There is another reason I feel games have less complex stories (and in many cases, gameplay) is because the audience has changed. Games used to be relatively closed to some audiences as those audiences weren't even considered as possible customers. With that, many games were geared toward a target audience, and RPG's tended to do so, to a tabletop-playing audience. As such, you got titles like Baldur's Gate, where a good part of the actual game was interacting with NPC's. However, with today\u2019s changed world, that is harder to do. Games cost more to make because of better graphics, stories are harder to fill in because of the demand for voice acting, and stories don't sell well to the majority of players anyway, so they aren't considered an important part of the game itself. I believe that it is wrong to criticize LoL for a lack of a story, however, as many games of yore also didn't rely on stories; they relied on innovative gameplay. And while Mobas aren't entirely unique and there are several examples of them, LoL offers its own unique experience, that isn't nearly as similar to, say, Dota 2, as Call of Duty is to almost all of the FPS's out there.

            "answer_text": "Games are a creative medium and will always be a creative medium. In some regards I'd say games are getting more creative. Yes LoL has little story, but every single champion has their own backstory and abilities, that takes a lot of creativity. Also LoL is not a story game, it's a MOBA, if you want amazingly creative story games just look for them, they are there. Their are many genres in gaming, some are just about the gameplay whilst others are about the story, and a lot are about both. Some good examples of great gameplay and great story include: The Last of UsThe Uncharted seriesHorizon Zero DawnThe Farcry seriesThe Legend of Zelda seriesThe Bioshock seriesThe Dishonored seriesReally the list goes on and on but those are some of the best games I have ever played and are certainly very creative. With the new technology to make better games, games have more room to be creative, so to answer your question, no, new games aren't less creative than old games. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "What does plot add to a game like LoL? I mean seriously. Okay, so imagine of you watched a game of baseball, buy before the game, the owners were required to write fanfics of the various positions (not the players, the POSITIONS) and some fans really wanted a love story between the left fielder and home plate because they never meet each other except do a shirt rendezvous hosted by the bat. Imagine if you had to suffer through a romantic subplot of the bishop and the knight before you were allowed to know how to move either in the game of chess? Competitive games gain value based on the depth of competition. With striking character designs and constantly new play elements being added, how could one even begin to make a claim to a lack of creativity? Your question is absurd. A game such as LoL doesn't need fluff to justify what's going on. It has deep lore as a selling point to attack a type of player; but the lore is not relevant to the game itself. Ashe does the same amount of damage regardless if she's married to Tryndamere or just some valentine's day cupid expy. Braun is as good a shield whether he has a mustache or not. Lulu's value as a laner is not affected by whether she polymorphs people into cupcakes or cats or dragon eggs. Fluff is not what the game is about. It's not trying to present a meta narrative between characters as its core game. The narrative that LOL presents is 5 players using their strengths and weaknesses to outplay 5 other players, leading to a singular conclusion: the destruction of a Nexus. That's it. ",

But complain when a game is like a \u2018cinematic experience\u2019. Does every game need a story? Does a great game have a story? Let's see\u2026Mario. no story, at all. Save the princess, that's it. Sonic. Save\u2026the animals, I guess? If the game is fun enough who cares about the story? Who cares about a plot. Online YouTube critics drag a game down for having no plot, even if the game needs no plot whatsoever, like a puzzle game. I play videogames for fun, to relax. I want to get to the game not hang around for 20 minutes hearing the protagonist bitching. It's worse when you have a super long tutorial that is just people talking shit about who or what. Just let me fucking play already! ",

Such examples are assassin\u2019s creed games. So from this perspective they are certainly more creative. However some others focus mostly at the graphics and the multiplayer and not in the story. The result is short and bad written scenarios that make the campaign a boring experience for those who play it. Such examples are battlefield 3 & 4 although some may disagree. ",

Now, before reading through them, I tried to remember the games of yesteryear that were good. I came up with three. 1700 entries, of which I recognize maybe 80, have played less than 20, and remember fondly perhaps half a dozen. There\u2019s exactly one, Chaos, that I want to play again.
