            "answer_text": "The song \"American Pie\" is a very well written piece that uses metaphors and puns to give a brief summary of popular music history from the 1950's through 1971. The day the music died is a pun that references Buddy Holly's song \"That'll Be The Day\" where he sings \"that'll be the day that I die\". When he died with Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper in a plane crash it was a turning point for popular music. The innocence was gone and the kid is the one who sings about the loss. For several years after that popular music really lost it's direction. There were few huge headliners. No one really replaced Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper. Elvis was off serving in the army. We saw slightly religious themed music along with Rhythm and Blues beginning to take the lead. This was a time when Rock n Roll was growing up and discovering itself. When this era dies it is lamented by a young adults who are about to join the workforce. The British Invasion of the early 60's brought back stars and big names. The third and fourth verses of the song are loaded with characters and metaphors for the time. The third verse is looking back over the previous decade and how the music had stagnated. But new stars were showing up. The jester is introduced and will be around through the rest of the song. He sang for royalty dressed like James Dean, and he sang with the voice of the people. This is Bob Dylan, wearing a red coat and singing folk music. He took the kings place while Elvis was out of the spotlight. Lenin and Marx are mentioned when introducing the quartet. The Beatles were about to take over and bury the folk trend. This time it is a group of friends lamenting the death of music. The fourth verse starts with a reference to Charles Manson, The Byrds, The Beatles and Eight Miles High. The old time folk stars tried to keep up but the jester was out of the game for a while. The Beatles almost dominated the scene, the British bands were the clear victors over folk music. And this time its a bunch of rowdy fans celebrating the death of music. The fifth verse is about the hippie scene, the generation lost in space. The Rolling Stones are referenced with Jack Flash at the same time the devil is mentioned. The Grateful Dead are given a little pun here with \"the devils only friend\". The devil is Mick Jagger here. After Woodstock The Stones set up a concert on the west coast as another Woodstock event, known as the Altamont Speedway Free Festival. They hired Hell's Angels for security and during the show they killed one person, Meredith Hunter.a few people in the audience. This event signaled the death of that era of music. This time Satan (Mick Jagger) is there to sing the song. The final verse begins with a reference to Janis Joplin whose death put the final nail in the coffin of the hippie movement. Music had hit another huge turning point, but this time its the spirits of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and The Big Bopper who sing the song. But we all joined in to sing it with them one last time.

            "answer_text": "Jo-Feb. 3rd, 1959. I was rather young (but precocious enough to know what happened and to whom) \u2014 Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J. P. Richardson (aka The Big Bopper) were killed in a small plane crash in Iowa. It was snowy and icy at the time. I had seen each of them on The Ed Sullivan Show and/or Bandstand (I watched Bandstand every afternoon for years, even after they left my hometown, Philadelphia, and we religiously watched Ed Sullivan every Sunday night). These were some of the first stars of rock and roll\u2026. I also remember the plane crash that killed Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, the Secretary-General of the UN 2.5 years later in Africa\u2026. Additional information- Waylon Jennings was Buddy Holly\u2019s bass player, and he gave up his seat on the plane for J. P. Richardson (who had the flu), and Buddy's guitarist, Tommy Allsup flipped a coin with Ritchie Valens to see who got the last seat on the plane. Every one else took the bus\u2026 Dion was also on the tour, and ended up on the bus. He says that Valens was the one with the flu. He flipped a coin with Valens, and won \u2014 but felt he couldn't justify spending $36 for the flight (which was what his parents used to pay for their apartment when he was young). The tour continued, adding Bobby Vee (15 years old!!!), because he knew all of Buddy's songs, and then Waylon took over for the next 2 weeks\u2026. ",
