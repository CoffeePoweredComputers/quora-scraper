            "answer_text": "The Edwardian period is so short, and the Victorian period so long and diverse, that it\u2019s hard to compare. If we look at the brief Edwardian years and compare them to various Victorian periods, they come off well, because Edwardian society benefited from the decades of reform, technological development, and social improvement that the Victorians had achieved. The Edwardian years also saw much more political involvement from women and the working class, and the beginnings of the Labour movement as a mainstream force, while at the same time travel became more accessible, great public works were begun, the middle class continued to expand and prosper, and in the Arts, the rewards of the fin de siecle were reaped. The disaster of WW1 was yet to happen, the long years of reform and progress had borne fruit \u2014 a good time to be British. It only lasted nine years, though, or thirteen if you throw in the period 1910\u20131914. And after that things went downhill fast and didn\u2019t really recover till the 1980s. ",
