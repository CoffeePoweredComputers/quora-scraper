            "answer_text": "Not every state in Europe was a big dog in the schoolyard. There were only three big dogs in continental Europe of the period who could stand up to France, and not even they could do it without some help from the other big guns: Austria, Russia and Prussia. Then there was the British Empire. From the later Revolution through the Consulate Republican France managed to survive assaults from the monarchies with a national levy of the citizenry who acquitted themselves well enough to drive off the professional armies opposing them. Along comes Napoleon, who ennobles himself, pummels opposing states and demands significant penalties for losing. The smaller states of Western Germany are consolidated into the Rhine Confederation and Italy comes under French control. The Netherlands, Swiss, Bavaria, Saxony join the French. Napoleon fufills a promise to migrant Polish nobles and recreates a Duchy of Warsaw under provisional French control. Spain is Bourbon and British payrolled. Napoleon invades and initially drives out the English. The Big Three are distressed as Napoleon populates his conquests with kings who are of the Bonaparte Clan or favored Marshals who marry sisters. This causes another round of combats, which Napoleon prevails in, but at greater cost, as his enemies are adapting their militaries to the French doctrine. While Napoleon is preoccupied in the east, Britain lands a new Army in Spain, commanded by the Duke of Wellington. The British gain ground. Napoleon decides that he must punish Russia for violation of the Continental Plan to refuse trade with the British. Napoleon marches into Russia and gets the Grand Army obliterated by attrition warfare and a death march trying to get back out of Russia in the middle of a violent winter. Austria offers Napoleon a convention: return French boundaries to their 1801 state and Europe will acknowledge him as ruler of France. Napoleon refuses the offers. The major powers bully their neighbors into joining a new campaign to crush Napoleon. 1813 Napoleon mobilizes a replacement army. The new cadres are not as threatening as his veterans and the French are crushed in Saxony. By the spring of 1814 the allies are in France. Napoleon is defeated and forced to abdicate. ",

            "answer_text": "Wars are fought on three different levels; the strategic, operational and tactical. The wars of the French Revolution compelled France to develop a body of tactics well-suited to large bodies of troops who were less well-drilled and schooled in the 18th C methods of linear warfare that the armies of its enemies, and to promote men of demonstrated ability and experience over those of high birth as was done elsewhere. This is where Napoleon comes in. Napoleon not only had tactical talent, but was head and shoulders above contemporaries in terms operational and usually strategic planning and execution. In essence, he was a bold general who kept his enemy confused as to his intention, all while continually planning for every possible countermove an enemy might make. Once he was in a position to do so, he also promoted men of proven ability to serve as his marshals in command of corps and wings of his army, and sometimes separate armies, and finally, he had a staff system for the dispatch and communication of orders that was better than any in Europe. Finally, Napoleon fought battles of annihilation in which he crushed enemy armies on the battlefield then reasoning he could get what he wanted from his enemies more easily at the negotiating table once he\u2019d destroyed there armies. This was different from 18th Century warfare in which long and drawn wars of exhaustion were fought, the measure of success being territory occupied over time as opposed to enemy forces destroyed and rendered inoperative. The proof of the effectiveness of the system is that France\u2019s enemies, excepting England all more or less reorganized their armies along lines similar to the French, though only the British produced a commander equal (some say superior) to Bonaparte in the form of Wellington.
