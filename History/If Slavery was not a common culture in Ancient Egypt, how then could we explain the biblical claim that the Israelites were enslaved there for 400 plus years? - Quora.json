            "answer_text": "It is unlikely that the Israelites would have fabricated this history in Egypt. But, the time period of 400 years does not correlate with historical facts. If they were there they would have been more like paid labor and perhaps in this case the wages were not what they wanted to be paid, as they were refugees in the Kingdom of Egypt. Thus, political problems most likely started from this. Egyption records are quite detailed in the fact that free men built the pyramids. These records are found repeatedly through out ancient Egyptian history. Of course this is a clear contradiction when compared to Biblical records, and from a historical perspective it is clear that the basis may have been political. The fact is that the Pyramids were already built when the claims were laid. There is the possibility that small group of Israelites may have indeed come to Egypt to escape a famine. But this group alone was incapable of building the Pyramids or having much effect on the economy of Ancient Egypt. As a work forces of hundreds of thousands carried out construction in Egypt. Of course it is not beyond possibility that this small group of refugees may have found work in construction in Ancient Egypt. And the way even Egyptian labor worked was grueling and this group may have found this unbearable. But, it is possible that this group was turned into abject slaves. As conditions improved in Israel this group may have wanted to go back. There may have been resistance to this. Ancient Egypt has left remarkably detailed records and so far nothing about Exodus has been found. Of course to a believer this argument will carry no weight. And, thus this history can be debated to no end. Of course Exodus can not simply be dismissed. And it is very possible that we have not yet found the evidence which is needed to prove it one way or another. But, as with any ancient text we may need to rethink that slavery may have meant exploitation and that the truth may lie somewhere in the middle. Of course the religious importance of Exodus can not be argued and a secular historic debate has nothing to do with religious implication. ",

            "answer_text": "Ancient Egypt lasted a long time (At least 3000 years), and the Israelites were only there for a relatively small part of that. It\u2019s quite possible that there was little slavery in Egypt during other periods but there was slavery during the time the Israelites were there. The Israelites were also not enslaved for all the time they were in Egypt. They were resident in Egypt for 400+ years. They were enslaved for part of that when \u201cA new pharaoh came to the throne who did not know Joseph\u201d. This new pharaoh may have been a member of a new dynasty, and may have been motivated partly by seeing the Israelites as a distinct group that supported a previous dynasty. 400 years is longer than EVERY ancient Egyptian dynasty, so this could easily have happened. If the new pharaoh saw the Israelites as supporters of a previous regime, he could have had additional incentives to enslave the Israelites, even if slavery in general was not common in ancient Egypt. Also, when we think of slaves, we tend to think of privately owned slaves, but the Israelites seem to have been government owned, so a scenario where most slaves were owned by the government while few private parties owned slaves is possible. When we say things like \u201cslavery was not common\u201d, we must also ask \u201cnot common compared to what?\u201d For example, let\u2019s say 5% of the population of Egypt was comprised of slaves at some point. Then, if you were in Egypt, chances were high that you would not be a slave. However, 5% of the total population of millions is still a lot of people. So maybe the Hebrews were not a high percentage of the total population of Egypt at the time they were enslaved, but there might still have been a lot of Hebrew slaves. ",
