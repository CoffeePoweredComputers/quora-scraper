            "answer_text": "Because it was a war America could not win.From the very start the Americans were fighting the wrong way, and for the wrong reasons. The man crux of the issue is that the Vietnamese wanted to be independent. That they wanted to shake off the colonial powers, which is why the rebelled against the French. The reason why they became communist is that it has anti-colonial sentiments and the USSR were willing to fund their struggle. So when the Americans stepped in to many vietnamese nationalists it was a foreign power intruding on Vietnamese soil all over again. This was further exacerbated by the war doctrine the americans adopted for this conflict. The idea was simple \u201cSearch and Destroy\u201d A nuclear superpower can\u2019t lose to some backwater east asian country. Except reality is not that simple. Unlike WW2 there was no clear enemy most of the time. The VC used guerrilla warfare, striking then fading in to the jungles. So the Americans unable to measure progress in ground taken started measuring it in lives. Former Marine Officer and later war-time corresponding Philip Caputo in the book A Rumor of War noted: General Westmoreland\u2019s strategy of attrition also had an important effect on our behavior. Our mission was not to win terrain or seize positions, but simply to kill: to kill communists and as many of them as possible. Stack \u2019em like cordwood. Victory was a high body-count, defeat a low kill-ratio, war a matter of arithmetic. The pressure on unit commanders to produce enemy corpses was intense, and they in turn communicated it to their troops. This led to such practices as counting civilians as Viet Cong. \u2018If it\u2019s dead and Vietnamese, it\u2019s VC,\u2019 was our rule of thumb in the bush. It is not surprising, therefore, that some men acquired a contempt for human life and predilection for taking it. (Vietnam War body count controversy - Wikipedia) By the time the United States ended its Southeast Asian bombing campaigns, the total tonnage of ordnance dropped approximately tripled the totals for World War II. The Indochinese bombings amounted to 7,662,000 tons of explosives, compared to 2,150,000 tons in the world conflict.(List of bombs in the Vietnam War - Wikipedia) So this lead to a vicious cycle. The Americans try to \u201ckill commie bastards\u201d Civilians are caught up The Veits try to \u201cDefend their homes\u201d Americans are killed Repeat ",

            "answer_text": "The VietCong were shrewd and cunning. They knew that America was a Very Powerful force to contend with- a very large Military force coupled with all the latest military hardware. It would surely spell doom to them if they fought the US on equal terms. That\u2019s why they brought the Battle to the Jungles; a territory where they had an advantage in and an area that would render America\u2019s high powered Warplanes useless. The Vietcong dug a Network of tunnels in the Jungle and often relied on Ambush to decimate the Americans. They called it \u201cGueriila Warfare\u201d. Part of their Guerilla warfare was also blending with the locals and shooting their enemies when their backs were turned. US forces didnt know who their Enemy were since any Vietnamese could kill them at any minute. The Vietcongs enforced Morale upon their troops. For every 1 American soldier, they\u2019d gladly sacrifice 10 of their comrades. It was no retreat no surrender for them. They were willing to fight up to the last man. This was in stark contrast with Americans back at home as they viewed the Vietnam war as a folly war; a war which America should\u2019ve avoided. Finally, the Vietcongs had Powerful Supporters. Chinese soldiers were fighting alongside the vietcong against the americans. It\u2019s Communist helping fellow Communist against uncle sam. If America decided to prolong the war, they\u2019d have to face China. When US troops face China, Russia would be their enemy. During the vietnam war, Communism cemented North vietnamese, China and Russia together. It really was a NO win situation for the us. To conclude, the Vietcong heeded Sun tzu\u2019s advice in the art of war; the americans neglected it. ",
