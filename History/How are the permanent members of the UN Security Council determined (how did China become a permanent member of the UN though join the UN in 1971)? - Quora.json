            "answer_text": "PRC took over the existing China seat by challenging credentials in a General Assembly vote dominated by decolonized African and Asian countries that PRC had cultivated, including providing aid while Chinese people themselves were in greater poverty. No action of the Security Council itself was involved. The UN Security Council was a watered down version of the Four Policemen - Wikipedia plan. The term \"Four Policemen\" refers to a post-war council consisting of the Big Four that U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed as a guarantor of world peace. The members of the Big Four, called the Four Powers during World War II, were the four major Allies of World War II: the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union and China. The United Nations envisioned by Roosevelt consisted of three branches: an executive branch comprising the Big Four, an enforcement branch composed of the same four great powers acting as the Four Policemen or Four Sheriffs, and an international assembly representing the member nations of the UN. The Four Policemen would be responsible for keeping order within their spheres of influence: Britain in its empire and in Western Europe; the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe and the central Eurasian landmass; China in East Asia and the Western Pacific; and the United States in the Western hemisphere. As a preventive measure against new wars, countries other than the Four Policemen were to be disarmed. Only the Four Policemen would be allowed to possess any weapons more powerful than a rifle. Churchill later insisted on adding France, viewing the ROC as allied with the USA and arguing the ROC was not that strong. In October 1942, Churchill told Eden that Republican China represented a \"faggot vote on the side of the United States in any attempt to liquidate the British overseas empire.\" The Big Four group of allies was from the List of Allied World War II conferences - Wikipedia summit conferences. The Big Four were the only four sponsoring countries of the San Francisco Conference of 1945 and their heads of the delegations took turns as chairman of the plenary meetings. During this conference, the Big Four and their allies signed the Charter of the United Nations. Allies of World War II - Wikipedia During December 1941, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt devised the name \"United Nations\" for the Allies and proposed it to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. He referred to the Big Three and China as a \"trusteeship of the powerful\", and then later the \"Four Policemen\". The Declaration by United Nations on 1 January 1942 was the basis of the modern United Nations(UN). At the Potsdam Conference of July\u2013August 1945, Roosevelt's successor, Harry S. Truman, proposed that the foreign ministers of China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States \"should draft the peace treaties and boundary settlements of Europe\", which led to the creation of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the \"Big Five\", and soon thereafter the establishment of those states as the permanent members of the UNSC. Stalin had only attended the conferences in Moscow, or Yalta, Crimea, or in Soviet-dominated Tehran, Iran or Soviet-occupied Potsdam, Germany. Chiang had attended the Cairo Conference where Roosevelt and Churchill endorsed Chinese recovery of Taiwan from Japan. So, you are probably wondering when India might have joined this club. Cripps Mission - Wikipedia Cripps worked to keep India loyal to the British war effort in exchange for a promise of elections and full self-government (Dominion status) once the war was over. Cripps discussed the proposals, which he had drafted himself with the Indian leaders, and published them. Both the major parties rejected his proposals, and they were also unacceptable to Churchill; no middle way was found and the mission failed. Congress moved towards the Quit India movement whereby it refused to cooperate in the war effort; in response, the British imprisoned practically the entire Congress leadership for the duration of the war. Jinnah and the Muslims, to whom Cripps had offered the right to opt out of a future Union, supported the war effort and gained in status in British eyes. Confidence in Britain was particularly low after the fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942, Britain's greatest single defeat in the war, as fell as the retreat from Rangoon, with large numbers of Indian Army troops captured. The threat of an invasion of India was real, and there was anxiety about 'fifth columnists,' particularly Congress radicals working with Japan. The British war cabinet, a coalition government of national unity, was divided on the question of compromise with the Congress. The Labour Party ministers and moderate Conservatives were keen to advance Indian progress to self-government in a way that would not endanger the war effort. Churchill was deeply opposed to any dismantling of the British Empire However, the United States, as Britain's principal ally saw things in even more urgent terms. The chief American strategic objective was aiding Chiang Kai Shek's physically isolated Nationalist China against the expanding Japanese Empire. The Japanese conquest of China's coastal areas meant that the US needed India to serve as a major logistical hub to funnel aid to China, and needed Indian military manpower to secure routes for supplies through Burma. American as well as Chinese leadership was convinced that this would not be possible without the full support of a mobilised Indian population, requiring a breakthrough with the Indian National Congress. In addition the Roosevelt administration which was busy formulating its vision for the post-war world order saw the decolonisation of Asia as a matter of US national interest for both ideological as well as commercial reasons. Despite these conflicts of interests, Britain's reliance on the United States for Lend-Leasesupplies for the war effort meant that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's pressure had to at least appear to be taken seriously, especially in light of the military disasters in South East Asia. As a result, the British cabinet by 9 March 1942 agreed to despatch a mission to India to discuss its offer, and Cripps' plane landed in Delhi on 22 March. By that time the British were willing to grant Indian independence at the conclusion of the war. Rajagopalachari, backed by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Maulana Azad and Jawaharlal Nehru held talks with Cripps and offered full support in return for immediate self-government, and eventual independence. Privately, Cripps also promised to get rid of Linlithgow and grant India Dominion Status with immediate effect, insisting only that the Indian Defence Ministry be reserved for the British. At this moment in 1942 when Britain was weakest and desperate for India\u2019s support in the war, Congress could have demanded inclusion of India\u2019s representative in the wartime summit conferences and group of major allies, and this would have been regarded as a symbolic concession secondary to support in the war. Note India already had an international diplomatic identity being one of the founding members of the League of Nations in 1920. ",

            "answer_text": "The 5 permanent members of the UNSC were the de facto promoters of the United Nations Organization. These promoting nations were the victors of the Second World War - the USA, USSR, Great Britain, France and China. As promoters they nominated themselves as Permanent Members, and invited other nations to join in. When the UNO Charter was finalized in 1945, the Government of China was controlled by the Kuomintang Party led by Chiang Kai Shek. This Government was deposed by the Communists led by Mao Tse Tung in 1948. Chiang Kai Shek and his followers fled to the island of Taiwan and continued to run their Government from Taipei. They called their country \u201cNationalist Republic of China\". In the meantime mainland China was called \u201cPeople's Republic of China\" with its capital in Beijing. Until 1971, the UN recognized the Nationalist Republic as the legitimate representative of the Chinese people. Since 1971 the Peoples Republic was recognized as the legitimate representative, and PRC became a Permanent Member by default. Incidentally, with the disintegration of the USSR, Russia has replaced the USSR as a UNSC permanent member by default. India, under British administration had joined the UNO as a founder member in 1945, signing on the Charter as a state different from Britain. It is reported that there had been a proposal to admit India as a permanent member of the UNSC some time after 1947, India this time defined as the Dominion of India. The Prime Minister at the time Jawaharlal Nehru had reportedly spurned this offer. Finally the Republic of India replaced the Dominion of India as a UN member state. ",
