            "answer_text": "It is an insanely broad question (600 years and the whole of Europe) but in general city guard was not a high statues job. Part of the guard duties were taken on by the guilds (every guild had, usually, a piece of citywall to defend and in piece time they might provide guards for the gate in that part of the wall) but the proto-police work was usually done by a mixture of people. For one there is the Night Watchman. Often quartered in one of the church towers up high he was tasked mainly with enforcing hearthfire regulations (after a certain hours there were no fires to be burning in the city), curfews and general fire watching (hence his quarters high up in the churchtower). This was usually a low-status \u2018unclean\u2019 job along the lines of tanners or executioners, though there were exceptions (in one Bavarian city the young members of the guilds guarded the city at night in rotation). His involvement (and it was almost always a he) in law enforcement was minimal: If he caught suspicious person he could arrest them but that was mainly an extension of his guard duties. The Day-Shift: The Cityguard Those are the means by which the city authorities dispense violence. Just as the Nightwatch this was a low status assignment but mostly it was also not, unlike nightwatch duty, a steady assignment. Usually the city had a watch official, nominated either be the citizenry or the authority ruling the city (bishop, king, nobles) who was respnosible for enforcing all the laws passed. Proper conduct on the markets, adherence to clothing laws, chasing beggars and thieves, etc. Usually there was a stipend for some regular watchmen, often veterans, with the ranks being filled up by legbreakers and toughs if the situation required it. Investigation were, for the most part, not part of the purview of these people. Criminals were either caught in the act or not. Suspects might be brought in to be questioned (with or without torture) but the questioning was not what the cityguard did: They just brought the people in. The Sharp Sword: The Executioner The Executionert was also an important part of the city law enforcement and he usually had formal training in his specialty and might even be the best trained asset of the whole cityguard. His purview did not just include lobbing heads of people, hanging them or killing them in other ways but also mutilations (hacking hands off thieves, for example) and torturing people. His occupation also placed him squarely in outcast territory with no grave in sanctified earth and no ability to settle in the better parts of town. The Legal Side of things: Magistrates These were people, often with juristic training, who were elected or nominated to be the judges and administrators of the city (\u2018judge\u2019 was often too small of a ticket to occupy a magistrate fulltime). They had command of the Cityguard and dispensed verdicts. This is for Germany, roughly High and late Middle Ages. ",
