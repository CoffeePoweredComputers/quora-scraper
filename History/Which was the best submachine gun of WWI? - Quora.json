            "answer_text": "There were essentially only one sub-machine gun that can be considered as weapons of WW1. As a new form of infantry small arm, it had some flaws. The MP 18-I was introduced by the Germans in 1918 and saw combat as portable firepower for Strosstruppen. The Italians had taken a 9mm twin machine gun, originally designed as a flexible aircraft gun, given it a bipod and shield. This made it basically a 9mm light machine gun with a very high rate of fire. It was issued to infantry battalions in three sections and used like a light machine gun. The mechanism, however, was sound and after the war, a single barrel form with a stock was produced, the OVP 1918, which might have made it into service in time for the planned Allied offensives of 1919. Another weapon that can be classified as submachine gun was the American Thompson, but while available in 1919, it probably wouldn\u2019t have been produced in numbers soon enough for more than a few to see service. Finally, there was the Pedersen device, the Pistol Model of 1918. This was a simple blow-back device that replaced the bolt of a modified M1903 Springfield, turning it into a self-loading rifle, firing a powerful pistol cartridge. This could have been modified to full auto and been the second near assault rifle issued after the Fedrov og1916, which used 6.5mm Arisaka. ",

            "answer_text": "There was only one real SMG that actually served in WWI and that was the Bergmann MP 18. It was only used in the latter part of 1918 by some specialist stormtroop units. The Italian Vilar Perosa was trialled but proved to be unsatisfactory, mainly due to the way it was deployed and the American Thompson SMG arrived too late to participate in WWI. The best portable automatic weapons of WWI were the British Lewis machine gun and the American BAR but they are not really sub machine guns in the modern accepted sense. ",

            "answer_text": "How many actual submachine guns were there in WW1? I think the Italians had a modified aircraft gun, which I\u2019d argue doesn\u2019t count even if it was 9mm, and the Germans had the MP18 which might have had terrible Luger snail drum magazines but was definitely an SMG with a sensible controllable rate of fire because nobody intended it to be shooting at aircraft from other aircraft. So by default I\u2019d say MP18. ",
