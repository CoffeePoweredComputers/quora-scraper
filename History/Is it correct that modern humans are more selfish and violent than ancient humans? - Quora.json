I think that humanity has always been violent and self-serving and generally has sought ways to get the most for the least amount of work. Over the last 20\u201330 years though I think that we have become desensitized to violence, we have become more selfish than self-centred, and we have not only become lazy, but worse, we have become intellectually lazy.
