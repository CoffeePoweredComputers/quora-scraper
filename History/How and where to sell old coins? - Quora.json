            "answer_text": "You have a lot of options. The one you decide on will depend on how quickly you want to sell them, the quality of the coins, the type of coins and the way you sell them. First, the description \u201cold coins\u201d is not very helpful in giving you advice on selling your specific coins. My coins are mostly between 1,000 and 2,750 years old. Most Numismatists and collectors consider any coins minted more recently than 1600 CE to be modern. There are many ways to sell the coins. If you want to do it yourself you can go to eBay, Collectivecoin.com, tantaluscoins.com, amazon and many other websites that let you list things for sales. Some of these sites are specifically aimed at coin collectors, some are flee markets. As with all the ways to sell your coins, this way has many advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, the fees you will pay are less than the other options and you can set your own prices. The disadvantages are larger: Less traffic on the website, lower average sales prices, you have to do all the work yourself and you need to know the correct prices to place on the coins. Another way to sell your coins is to consign the coins to an auction house. Auctions generally charge the consignor 10\u201315% of the sales price but some places also have minimum fees per coin. The average fees also vary by the type of coin. The major problems with this sales arrangement is that you may wait a long time before the coin is listed in an auction, final sales prices are frequently well below retail value of the coins (although some coins inexplicably sell for many times what they are estimated at) and payment is made only after the buyer pays for the coins. Some auction house will wait for 45, even 90, days after receiving payment to pay the consignor. Coins can also be consigned to a dealer. If a dealer is willing to take your coins on consignment, the fees you pay will average about 20% of the sale price. However you will have to wait for payment until the coin sells and the dealer is, justifiably, going to put more effort into selling the coins that he owns first. These coins will result in more profit for him. Alternatively you can sell the coins directly to a dealer. This may be the most expensive way to get rid of your coins. Dealers will rarely pay more than 30% of what they think they can sell the coin for. This is not because they are ripping you off and is actually a fair price under the circumstances. If a dealer buys your coins, he is doing you a favor. He is taking the coins off your hands and giving you money. He is gambling that he can resell the coins at a profit. He will probably have to hold on to many of them for a long time. He may have to slab some of them at his expense depending on the type and grade of the coin. He needs the sale of the coins he buys to cover his rent and other overhead in addition to the amount he paid you. One other problem with consigning or selling coins to a dealer is finding one. There aren\u2019t a lot of coins stores on main street or in the malls anymore. You may have to look online or, if your not near a major city, travel to a coin show. Also the best payments will come from honest dealers who are knowledgeable about the types of coins you\u2019re selling. Since you don\u2019t already know the dealers, it can be tough to find the right one. (Note: most established dealers are honest. Don't be fooled by the fact that you heat a lot more about the bad ones than the good ones). ",

            "answer_text": "First, you need to understand that billions of coins were produced. Many type of metals were used - zinc, copper, bronze, silver, gold and mixture of metals. If you have U.S. coins, they are more valuable to the American collectors. Foreign coins are not valued as highly in the U.S. identify what coin you have - country of origin, denomination, and most importantly the date it was minted. More importantly, find out how many pieces were minted. In U.S. , an old coin from Denver mint, with a \u201cD\u201d marking is more common than \u201cS\u201d , San Francisco mint. The \u201cS\u201d always bring more money.then grade the coin - they range from junk to mint, in the U.S., the highest grading is MS-70 , proof coin. It takes a lot of experience to grade accurately, so unless the coin is worth thousands, you probably don\u2019t want to spend $100 getting it certified. So a local dealer is your friend in this case. The same coin graded average vs mint can mean hundreds of dollars in differencenow, you can get on eBay to see how much people are asking for it, then look at Completed Sales to see how much they ACTUALLY sold for.now you can either list it on eBay, Craigslist, OfferUp, etc. or you can sell it to a coin dealer for about 20% of retail value.Remember that just because a coin is \u201crare\u201d , it doesn\u2019t mean that people pay big money for it. Collectors change directions all the time, and timing matters. so, what coin do you have?? ",
