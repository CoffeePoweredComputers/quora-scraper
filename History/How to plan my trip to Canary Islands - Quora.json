            "answer_text": "You have to decide which island you want to go to. Tenerife, followed by Gran Canaria, have the most to do. These are the islands with a TON of night life, restaurants, clubs, etc. You won\u2019t usually get bored at all. If you want an adult all-inclusive and fantastic beaches, then you want Fuertaventura followed by Lanzarote. If you\u2019re into doing things that are a bit off the beaten path, then maybe La Palma, La Gomera or El Hierro are for you. These last three islands aren\u2019t the most touristy places, but offer really great hiking and camping. They\u2019re really popular with people who don\u2019t want to sit around on a beach. After that, you need to select where you want to stay. If you\u2019re staying on Fuertaventura or Lanzarote, you\u2019re almost certainly going to be by a beach and that\u2019ll be that. If you\u2019re staying on El Hierro, La Gomera or La Palma, you may not be in a beach town, but given the size of the islands, it won\u2019t matter. You\u2019ll be so close to the ocean that you will get there in no time (though the coasts will be rocky). In any case, these islands are conducive to renting a car and driving around to see them. Other than Fuerteventura, the other islands can be circumnavigated in a few hours, but Fuert will gobble up a whole day (not a bad thing!). The two places where you have to put some thought into it will be Gran Canaria or Tenerife. Because they\u2019re so big and mountainous, you\u2019re going to get some climate variations. Tenerife has THE most variation in climate. The north is lush and green (windward) and generally a bit cooler (but shouldn\u2019t be presumed as \u201ccold\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a warm, sunny island, not Ireland). The southwest is hot and dry (and the most touristy part). The southeast is a bit drier as well though not as much as the southwest part. Gran Canaria is mostly dry and sunny, though the northern half is a bit wetter and a bit greener. If you want really great beaches but also access to a larger island with great night life, then Gran Canaria will probably be a superior choice. The beaches beat Tenerife. While Tenerife does have some nice beaches, I must confess, they\u2019re nothing compared to Lanzarote or Fuertaventura. No matter what, these aren\u2019t huge islands and you can rent a car and really get to see a lot of the island in a few days of exploring. The most difficult part is choosing. After that, you book your hotel, accept the fact that you\u2019re going to just have to get lost and then find your way around. That\u2019s the best part. ",
