            "answer_text": "Honestly, I do not know what you mean when you say \"innocent people\". Partisans and terrorists were harmless and inoffensive saints? Perhaps the saboteurs? The murderers of unarmed soldiers? It is difficult to specify -for a Soldier- when someone shoots you, is throwing explosives, or blows up the vehicle where you are driving ... if your enemy is an \u201cinnocent angel\u201d.  If for a court of justice it is difficult to issue a fair verdict, imagine that you have no judges to turn to when they are attacking you.  In the 2nd World War, there are not -in fact- completely innocent parties. The Jews had been accustomed I.E. by belonging to the resistance in all countries where Germany set foot.  Assassinating at discretion everything that was Teutonic or wear uniform. It was a characteristic of that people until they themselves became occupying armies when they obtained their State of Israel in Palestine ... using the same defensive methods as the Germans at the time when they had to defend themselves from their subversive activities.
