But all 100% traders loss money in trading but out of these only 1% traders actually win 6 to 7 times in 10 trades Even if they win in 4 to 5 trades they make sure that they lose less then they earn so in the end of the day they can take profit to the home The 90% of the traders you are talking about is actually are those traders who go home back in less then 90 days mean 90 % of the traders loss their 90% of total capital in less then 90 days and this is not words but these are actually facts other 9% people who are neither in 1 percent nor in 90% are those who move to investing or take 365 days to get out of the market and maybe from these 9 % percent some of people also become the least 1% traders who make their living in trading and they become really good in this If you see my previous answer you'll see lots of arrogance in my words about how I made 15x within a year and always think that I will not loss but one trade happen that really kill my all arrogance and teach me the lesson of my life and if you want to really learn trading stop going to trading classes trade by yourself and I am sure you'll loss as much as you'll pay for the classes but but you'll learn probably 10x of what you can get in those so called trading workshops Good luck ",

            "answer_text": "How can 90% of people lose their money on the stock market? Simple\u2026 they play monopoly or similar games with house rules, figure out that they are good at this and then try to emulate their success in real life\u2026 But, they do so in an uneducated way.. Most people buy a stock and wait for it to go up.. Most do not think of being short sellers, so they limit their game. But, they also buy and then get busy and then panic. If you are going to panic learn how to set stop-losses. This means that you can exit when it suits you and not when you happen to log in. Usually by then it is too late.. However, successful investors have a game plan. So they may buy Tesla at $350 next month, with a reasonable expectation that it would rise to $430 and then sell. They do not worry if it dips to $280\u2026 they expect it to go up because their models say so. But they listen to Musk\u2019s tweets and if he says something bad, they accept that their model did not include him and cut their losses. Novices wait too long. Experts tend to buy the rumour and sell the news. Hence they would buy at $320 and sell 3 days before battery day.. When Musk tweeted that it was not great news\u2026 They sold. Also, novices will do crazy things like buy or margin when they do not have the spare capacity to cover the margin if the stock crashes\u2026 Bad. There are many, many ways to play this game. The trick is to get yourself a practice account and play the real game. Read up all the time and follow the companies you buy into\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Traders fail and lose all their money because they do not take their time with the required education and training to do this business. They do not go through all of the steps there are to be able to understand just what they are getting themselves into.  Trading is a vicious and brutal business to be in if you are not prepared for the brutality and volatility that go on in the live markets every day. The numbers are ugly for brand new traders. have a look at these books The Brutal Reality of Day Trading for Beginners, Day Trading Myths Revealed. It\u2019s said that the average brand new trader loses an average of 25 thousand dollars in their first 3 months of trading live and 40 thousand in the first year, to me that\u2019s just crazy! why not just do the education and training the right way from the first day and take you time. I always tell the traders I help out the market is always going to be there waiting to pay you. Brand new traders think they can learn a few chart patterns and then begin trading live against the best professional traders in the world, sorry newbie it doesn\u2019t work like that. It takes at least a year to get it down pat and to be able to work from a strict rule based trading plan which you can follow in both good times and bad. It can take as long as 3\u20135 years to become consistently profitable. I know that\u2019s not what you want to hear however it is the brutally raw truth. There is a certain progression that all brand new traders must go through and if you\u2019re not willing to do it then I strongly urge you to look at some other type of business because only one thing happens from not doing this business right from the first day, you lose all your money, ALLLLLL OF IT!

I hope this helps Good luck with your trading and investing and remember: Trade smart\u2026OR JUST DON\u2019T TRADE! Stock Trading Blogger ",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t take investing as gambling Let me repeat this in simple words- \u201cINVESTING IS NOT GAMBLING!\u201d. Do not buy any random stock and expect it to give you two times return in a month. 1. Get an education This is probably the most relevant do\u2019s of stock market investing. If you really want to become a successful stock investor, start learning the market. It doesn\u2019t mean that you should enroll in a college program/degree. Self-education is the best way to learn. There are tons of free information available on the internet which you access to learn the market. Moreover, if you want to get a head-start, you can also enroll in a few good online stock market investing courses. Let the learning begin. 2. Start small If you are just starting to learn how to swim, you won\u2019t jump in 8 ft deep water, right? Similarly, when beginning to start investing in the stock market, start small. Invest the lowest possible amount and gradually increase your investments as you get more knowledge and confidence. 3. Get started early I cannot emphasize enough on the importance of getting started soon with your finances. Time is in your favor when you start investing early. Moreover, here you get enough time to recover even if you make some losses during the early time of your investment journey. 4. Research before investing One of the key reasons why people do not make money from stocks is that they do not put the initial efforts before investing in the share. Every investor needs to research the company before investing. Here you need to learn the company\u2019s fundamentals, financial statements, ratios, management and more. If you do not want to regret later, research the company first before investing. 5. Only invest what is surplus: The stock market gives an immense opportunity to invest in your favorite companies and make money. However, there are always a few risks involved in the market, and no returns are guaranteed. Moreover, many times a bad (or bear market) may even last for years. Therefore, you should only invest the surplus money which does not affect your lifestyle even if you can\u2019t get it out. 6. Have an investment goal It\u2019s easier to plan your investments (and to monitor your progress) if you have an investment goal/plan. Your goal may be to build a corpus of Rs 10 Crores in the next ten years or to build a retirement fund. Having a goal will keep you motivated and on track. 7. Build a stock portfolio For making good consistent money from the stock market, just having two or three stocks is not enough. You need to build a winning stock portfolio of 8\u201312 stocks which can give you reliable returns. Although it\u2019s very less likely that you can find all the fantastic stocks to invest at once. However, year-after-year you can keep adding/removing stocks to build a strong portfolio that can help you reach your goals. 8. Average out: It\u2019s challenging to time the market and almost impossible to buy the stock at the exact bottom and sell them at the highest point. If you\u2019ve done it, you might be lucky. 9. Diversify \u201cDo not put all your eggs in one basket!\u201d. The risk involved while investing in just one stock is way higher compared to a portfolio of ten stocks. Even if one or two of your stock starts performing poorly in the later scenario, it may not affect the entire portfolio too much. Your stock portfolio should be sufficiently diversified. 10. Invest for the long-term It\u2019s a common fact that all the veterans of the stock market who made an incredible fortune from stocks are long term investors. But why do long-term investing helps to build wealth? Because of the power of compounding, the eighth wonder of the world. If you want to build massive wealth from the market, invest for the long-term. 11. Hold the winners, cut the losers Cut you losing stocks if they under perform for a long time and hold your winning stocks longer to allow them to offer even better returns. This is the golden mantra of investing that you should strictly follow. Moreover, keeping your winners and cutting losers will also help in building your dream portfolio. 12. Invest consistently Most people get excited and enter the stock market when the market is doing well, and the indexes are touching new highs. However, if you only invest in a bull market and exit when the market is down i.e. when stocks are selling at discount, you will never find fantastic opportunities to pick cheap stocks. Do not invest in the market just for a year. If you want to make good money from stocks, invest consistently and periodically increase your investment amount. 13. Have Patience Most stocks take at least 1\u20132 years to give good returns to the investors. Moreover, the performances get better when you give more time. Have patience while investing in the share market and do not sell your stocks too soon for short term gratification. 14. Don\u2019t have unrealistic expectations: Yes, many lucky guys in the market have made 400\u2013500% return on their single investment. However, the truth is that these kinds of news get quickly circulated (and inflated). Have realistic expectations while investing in stocks. A return between 12\u201318% in a year is considered good in the market. Moreover, when you compound this return over multiple years, you will get way higher returns compared to 3.5% interest on your savings account. Further, do not assume that you can get the same profits as others, who might be investing in stocks from many past years and may have acquired an amazing skill set. You can also get similar returns, but only after enough knowledge and practice. 15. Don\u2019t over trade When you are trading frequently, you are repeatedly paying for the brokerage and other charges. Don\u2019t buy/sell the stocks too often. Take confident decisions and make transactions only when necessary. 16.Don\u2019t follow the herd Your colleague purchased a stock and made 67% returns from it within a year. Now, he\u2019s boasting about it, and many of your office-mates are buying that stock. What would you do next? Should you buy the stock? Wrong! No investor can get significant success from the market by following the herd. Do your own research, rather than following the crowd. 17. Don\u2019t take unnecessary risks Investing all your money in a hot stock/industry to get a little higher return is never a wise move. Safeguarding your money is equally important than getting high returns. You should never take unnecessary risks while investing in stocks and your \u2018risk-reward\u2019 should always be balanced. 18. Don\u2019t make emotional decisions The human mind is very complex, and there are many factors both internal and external that can affect the choices we make. While investing in the stock market, do not take emotional decisions. No matter how much you like a company, if it is not profitable and doesn\u2019t have a bright future potential, it may not be the right investment decision. Do not get emotional while making your ",

The same trader keeps losing in some and gains in some trades. He may lose in 80 to 90 percent of his trades but lose small amounts. He may make a big gain in the balance trades. The trader may lose on some days of the week but may make up for the losses on other days. ",

The more you play, the more it statistically will erode your long term profitability. Very large hedge funds / asset managers such as Pimco can minimise this by virtue of their size- they get mid pricing as investment bank flow desks welcome the volume.Taking too much risk. Most people take far too much. To give an idea, most amateur traders will take risk that blows you out at a 1 or maybe 2 standard deviation price move, trying to return multiples on their investment. Pro traders will be much more risk adverse, trying to make maybe 5-10% over a whole year.in short, it comes down to having incredible discipline and maths to be a good trader.

Traders should accept that trade sometime don\u2019t work, in fact trades fail more often than they sustain. Since there is no method of foretelling which trade will work, traders have to be consistent and disciplined in the market to be profitable. Traders should always think about risk before reward and be at least two times more focused on risk per trade than reward. Not able to master the risk and reward in trading is probably one of the main reasons why so many traders are destined to fail. It is one of the ways to get an edge in the market place. Trading is a marathon. Wonderful opportunity comes to those who trade with patience and thoughtful plan with effective use of their available capital. Great trades sometime come with small losses. Keeping losses in check is a key to successful trading. In trading, it\u2019s important to have a plan and more important is having discipline in executing that plan.
