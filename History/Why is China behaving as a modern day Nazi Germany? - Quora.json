            "answer_text": "Definitely not. Maybe in some aspects, such as ethnic cleansing of Xinjiang. But generally speaking, The Chinese Communist Party is Nothing like Nazi Germany. The Chinese Communist Party does not care for their citizens and treats Han, Tibetans and Uighurs equally miserably. In contrast, Nazi Germany prioritized Ethnic Germans whilst marginalizing other ethnic groups. The only thing nationalistic about the Chinese Communist Party is their propaganda. The Chinese Communist Party hates religion, anything deviating from the party line is illegal and \u201csubversive.\u201d In comparison, it is arguable that Nazis persecuted religions, however the scale of which was no way even close to comparing to the target religious persecution of Chinese Christians, Muslims and Falun Gong Practitioners. The Chinese Communist Party hates traditional culture. Although they now claim to champion traditional Chinese culture, nothing can excuse the destruction thereof in the past 60 years. Nazi Germany, in contrast, tried their best to preserve traditional German traditions, festivals and customs. Adolf Hitler himself was a talented classical artist who focused on traditional architecture, criticizing and marginalizing \u201cdegenerate modern art (Entarete Kunst).\u201d The Chinese Communist Party hates the environment. The party philosophy of battling with the heavens and the Earth. The Chinese Communist Party does not care about contaminating rivers, releasing harmful particulates into the atmosphere or destroying natural water flow in their ambitious dam projects. Ethnic Germans were living the life during Nazi Germany, if it wasn\u2019t for the war and tough sanctions, Germany had real potential to surpass even the US with Innovation and Technology. The US in fact hired talented Nazi Scientists through Operation Paperclip. \u201cNational Socialism is as Socialist as Prager University is a real University.\u201d ",
