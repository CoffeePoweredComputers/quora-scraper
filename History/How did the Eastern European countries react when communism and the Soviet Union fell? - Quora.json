            "answer_text": "I consider communism has fallen at 7.02.1990 when communist party in URSS has decided to give up monopol of power. By than practically all countries in Easter Europe already changed the system (I think only Albania made it later). Gorbachev started perestroika and glasnost in 1985\u201386. For regular citizens outside URSS it was a marvelous incredible idea. For me Gorby is still the most sympathetic communist ever!!!. There were 2 types of communist leaders in Eastern Europe : reformers in Hungary and Poland and old style stalinist type : DDR-HONECKER, Czechoslovakia-HUSAK, Bulgaria-ZHIVKOV and Romania-Ceausescu. All those had massive clash with Gorbachev accusing him of destruction of communism. The hardest one (and hardest to change) was Ceausescu. He had many furios attacks on various occasions to Gorbachev reforms. Just 1 month before his death Ceausescu had a violent attack on perestroika at TV calling this will happen to Romania when \u2018\u2019pig fly\u2019\u2019. In 1987 he was received with a lot of fear by Ceausescu to Bucharest and v. honestly cheered by tenth of thousands of Romanians. It was probably the most honest welcome Romanians ever made to an URSS leader. I was teenager and I remember we hoped that Gorby will kick our stalinist out of his office.   In October 1989 Romanian communist party looked like it will still rule Romania for at least 100 years while under it it has grown a huge black hole which in just 2 month wiped out 45 years of communism. It remained deeply in our minds and still have side effects even after 30 years. Unfortunately the change happened violently in Romania by 1200 death. After 1 week of fights Ceausescu was put on trial and executed by execution squad He and She were kept under arrest in a military unit exclusively under direct protection of high ranking officers (they were afraid the soldiers will shoot them on spot). When the execution squad formed they need 6 volunteers. All 2500 soldiers step ahead in order to shoot him. I point that in order to understand state of spirit in that moment. If left free on street in 10 minutes he would have experienced Mussolini style lynching action by the first 10 people met. Below pictures of his trial and execution. He died bravely by singing Socialist International song.   and some nostalgic to his grave.  Below a some pictures from what we call 1989 Revolution. Below candel in memory of death and a inscription - \u2018\u2019WE DON\u2019T WANT COMUNISM EVER\u2019\u2019.  and devastated central square in Bucharest   An picture with \u2018\u2019peace to death, by Christmas we took our ration of FREEDOM\u2019\u2019 ; it refers that we used to get food and bread on ration.  below \u2018\u2019our kids will be free\u2019\u2019  And below our happiness immediately after revolution won . I remember my grandfather crying in front of tv still refusing to believe this is really happening in front of his eyes.   below Romanian flag with communist banner off in the middle.  When communism fell in URSS we had no extra-reaction. We were mourning out death and tried to restart our life. Apart of Ceausescu and his wife nobody had been executed. 6 month after this event death penalty was abolished. Ceausescu had 3 children, one directly involved in politics. The one involved in politics and supposed next party boss was trialed for ordering police to shoot against protesters. He sit 3\u20134 years in prison than released because he was sick by cirrhosis and died later in a hospital in Vienna. Last son of Ceausescu still alive and recently got by court decision lots of paintings and other personal belongings of his father. Apart of the people directly involved in repression of 1989 (send to jail) nobody of the previous communist party was jailed or punished in any way. We want to forgive (but not forget) crimes committed during 1944\u20131960 by this criminal regime. Most of former high ranking communist party members or secret police have huge pensions (by thousands of euros) paid by capitalist Romania. Many are proud millionaire capitalists. ",

            "answer_text": "Second hand account: Communism in the Czech Republic/Czechoslovakia stopped several years before the Soviet Union \u201cfell,\u201d at around the same time as it stopped in other Central European countries like East Germany, Poland and Hungary i.e. in the autumn of 1989. While some people doubtless were unhappy and there was some fear about what was going to happen most of the people I know partied. There had been a bit of a struggle before it ended, with major demonstrations taking place in Prague, and some of the demonstrators died \u2014 but it was relatively violence free compared to, say, Tiananmen Square. My wife told me that in November 1989, she was sitting in class (she would have been 16 years old), when she heard a noise outside; lots of people had spontaneously taken to the street to celebrate the end of the era. None of the children could focus on what was happening in the classroom; and the teacher simply looked at the children and with an air of resignation, told them that they could go ahead and join in the procession outside. My wife and the rest of her classmates, along with most of the school left school spontaneously and joined the celebratory throng. She says that for two or three years following there was an feeling of elation and freedom in the air; people were excited. To some minor extent I believe that excitement still lingers in her generation (she is now in her late forties.), particularly the more successful of them, I suppose. There was a bit of chaos and some people were able to make a lot of money in ways that were less than legal or honest (and would definitely not be possible in more straightforward, regulation-laced world of today); but there were also opportunites that were completely legal and honest and which some were able to take advantage of in the nineties, again, the relatively simple civil code of the time meant that there wass a lot of grey area and wiggle room. and regulation Many of the bigger Czech companies were founded at that time, much of them springing from the ashes of old, inefficient Communist companies. Others were sold to foreign investors and many of those still operate. I love hearing stories from this time, and I envy the Europeans of my wife\u2019s generation who have seen and lived in through two completely different worlds: it grounds them and gives them a sense of perspective that most Western Europeans or North Americans lack, I think.
