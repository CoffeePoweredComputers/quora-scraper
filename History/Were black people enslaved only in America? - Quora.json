            "answer_text": "Africans were enslaved in many places not just in America. But, your question is one sided. Europeans were also enslaved in America and were enslaved in many places also. Africans were enslaved in Europe yes, but too Europeans were enslaved in Africa. You really should consider asking a more balanced question or questions rather than asking a question or questions that reveal a typically asymmetrical world view. You question presupposes that the only people ever enslaved were Africans. Europeans (Slaves) were enslaved by their fellow Europeans in Europe in the same way Africans were enslaved by their fellow Africans. In fact, the etymology of the word \u201cslave\u201d actually came from the word \u201cSlav or Slavic\u201d Slavs are the largest European ethinic group in Europe. Africans weren't Slavic the last time I checked! ",

            "answer_text": "Blacks were enslaved by other blacks in their own lands. Being enslaved was often a consequence of losing a war with someone and being taken prisoner. It had been that way for millennia and in some cases still exists today. When the slave trade started bringing slaves to the new world (I think the Spanish were the first to do that) they took advantage of the slave trade already going on in places like Timbuktu and other centers of trade on the African continent. Slaves were also used in South America and pretty much anywhere the Colonial Powers of Europe went to set up plantations to extract resources such as sugar cane, cotton and other stuff that was meant to bring gold to the coffers of the kings and queens involved. Blacks weren\u2019t the only ones being enslaved either. There are many tales of Europeans being swept up by slavers and sold on the slave market for a quick bag of <insert currency here>. In fact slavery was acceptable in the Islamic world as long as the slave was not Muslim. ",
