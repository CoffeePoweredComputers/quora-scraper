            "answer_text": " ( After Centuries of nearly constant war the Byzantine empire in 1453 had shrunk to a mere shadow of its former greatness as more and more stronger powers emerging in the east had whittled away at the empire.) It fall to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 when the Turks captured Constantinople, the last hold out of the Roman Empire, formally known as Byzantine. The siege of Constantinople under Mehmed II was one of the great turning points in history and it saw one of the earliest mass use of cannon. Mehmet had some guns especially crafted just for the purpose of battering down Constantinople\u2019s walls. The last Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI died in battle defending the city. It is said though there where no witness\u2019s to his death, that he led a last desperate charge against the Ottomans and that is where he was killed. On being given a chance to surrender it is believed by many that he gave a defiant answer and was fully prepared to die in the defence of his city. Though another source from Nicolo Barbaro states that he hanged himself once the walls were breached. \u201cAs to surrendering the city to you, it is not for me to decide or for anyone else of its citizens; for all of us have reached the mutual decision to die of our own free will, without any regard for our lives.\u201d (Constantine XI)  (Though this cannon was crafted in 1464, 11 years after the fall of Constantinople it is similar to many of the guns that the Ottoman Turks used in the siege.)  (Painting by Fausto Zonaro of the Ottoman army on the march dragging along with them one of the giant bombards that was used to batter down the walls.) The fighting was bitter and costly as both sides fought with extreme courage, again and again the Ottoman\u2019s charged and reached the walls and were then repulsed only for them to charge again. Often at the front of these charges were the elite of the Ottoman army, the Janissaries attacking to the sound of pipes and drums. \u201cThey found the Turks coming right up under the walls and seeking battle, particularly the Janissaries ... and when one or two of them were killed, at once more Turks came and took away the dead ones ... without caring how near they came to the city walls. Our men shot at them with guns and crossbows, aiming at the Turk who was carrying away his dead countryman, and both of them would fall to the ground dead, and then there came other Turks and took them away, none fearing death, but being willing to let ten of themselves be killed rather than suffer the shame of leaving a single Turkish corpse by the walls.\u201d (Nicolo Barbaro) Janissaries were basically slave soldiers. They were recruited as children from the Christian realms of the Ottoman Empire and forced to serve the Sultan. They were taken as a sort of tax from the Christian territories, instead of gold the Christians gave their own children. However not all was doom and gloom, most of the recruited children came from peasant stock and once enrolled into the Janissaries they often found that life was better serving in this elite corp than it would have been in their own villages or farms. Though the training was very tough and the discipline strict and harsh the boys would eat food that they could only have dreamed of back home and would wear fine clothes and have access to the finest baths in the city. Trained since children to become soldiers, by the time they reached adulthood soldiering is all that they would have known, having been very young when taken from their homes. Years of training and indoctrination turned these boys into formidable soldiers whom were greatly feared.  ({Above] The Janissaries enter the city, artists name not supplied. {below}) The huge 27 foot long bombard nicknamed \u2018Basilica,\u2019, artist\u2019s name not supplied. {Possibly Richard Hook.}  In accordance to the rules of war at the time because the city did not surrender and had to be taken by a mixture of costly assaults and siege Constantinople left itself open to be plundered by the Turks. This was standard practice in Medieval times, if a city surrendered then there would be no massacre and the population would often only see a change of rulers, but if the city chose to fight then the city could be plundered and the population either massacred or sold as slaves. The massacre of the people of Constantinople was indeed horrific, the likely ones were captured and ever ransomed or sold as slaves. \u201cThe Turks loaded all their ships with prisoners and with an enormous quantity of booty. Their practice was, that when they went into a house, at once they raised up a flag with their emblem on it, and when other Turks saw this flag flying, they left this house alone, and went in search of another house without a flag, and so they put their flags everywhere, even on the monasteries and churches. As far as I can estimate, there would have been two hundred thousand of these flags flying on the houses all over Constantinople: some houses had as many as ten, because of the excitement which the Turks felt at having won such a great victory. For the rest of the day these flags were kept flying on the houses, and all through the day the Turks made a great slaugh\u00adter of Christians through the city. The blood flowed in the city like rainwater in the gutters after a sudden storm, and the corpses of Turks and Christians were thrown into the Dardanelles, where they floated out to sea like melons along a canal. No one could hear any news of the Emperor, what he had been doing, or whether he was dead or alive, but some said that his body had been seen among the corpses, and it was said that he had hanged himself at the moment when the Turks broke in at the San Romano gate.\u201d (Nicolo Barbaro)  ({Above} The damage done to the walls of Constantinople by Mehmet\u2019s cannon is still clearly visible today. {Below] A restored section of the walls.)  \u201cOn the third day after the fall of our city, the Sultan celebrated his victory with a great, joyful triumph. He issued a proclamation: the citizens of all ages who had managed to escape detection were to leave their hiding places throughout the city and come out into the open, as they were to remain free and no question would be asked. He further declared the restoration of houses and property to those who had abandoned our city before the siege. If they returned home, they would be treated according to their rank and religion, as if nothing had changed.\u201d (George Sphrantzes)  (Castle Rumlihisari, this impressive castle was built on the orders of Mehmet II for the sole purpose of blocking the eastern approaches to Constantinople during the siege. One Venetian vessels ignoring the orders to stop was sunk by a single cannon shot and all the survivors were beheaded apart from the captain who was impaled on the battlements. With the help of thousands of labourers this imposing castle was constructed in just four months.) ",

            "answer_text": "It survived for another thousand years after its western brethren collapsed. During those thousand years, it had many ups and downs. At one point, under Emperor Justinian I in the 6th century CE, it would reconquer much of the territory of its former western counterpart, but then would eventually lose it again. This cycle of expansion and contraction, to a greater and lesser degree, would characterize the empire for much of the remainder of its existence. Because of its distance from the Italian peninsula and its proximity to Greece, over time it diverged from its root Latin culture and language. It began to resemble more and more that of its Hellenistic component, including adopting the Greek language. The last emperor to speak Latin as a first language would be Justinian I. During the bleakest period of Europe\u2019s \u2018dark ages\u2019, it remained a bastion of Christendom, a beacon of learning, art, medicine, law and architecture, and a fulcrum of trade between east and west. For much of its existence, it served as a protective bulwark for Europe against Asia. Its scholars and scribes were responsible for the preservation of much of the classical literature that we still have today. During their long and storied existence, they never referred to themselves as \u2018Byzantine\u2019. That was a name attributed to the empire after its collapse. They knew their history and their origins, and they called themselves \u2018Romans\u2019 and their empire was the \u2018Roman Empire\u2019. Because of its location on the threshold between Europe and Asia, the empire was almost constantly under threat, be it from Persians, Arabs or Ottomans. Some thousand years after its western counterpart fell, the capital Constantinople(today\u2019s Istanbul), essentially all that remained of the empire by then(aside from the Peloponnese), had endured a two month siege by the Ottoman Turks. Then, on May 29th 1453, Sultan Mehmed II finally breached the walls of the great city. The Emperor Constantine XI and his entire court perished in the ensuing battle, and many of the Roman troops abandoned their posts, returning home to protect their own families. A small fleet of visiting Venetian ships, groaning under the weight of the foreign diplomats, refugees and mercenaries packed onto their decks and into their hulls, luckily was able to slip away from the doomed city to safety. The city endured three days of looting and pillaging by Ottoman troops, during which its women were raped, and many citizens were either butchered or enslaved. Four days after the siege ended, the first Muslim prayer service was held in the 900 year old cathedral of Hagia Sophia. After existing for over a thousand years in the east and another thousand before that after its original founding myth of \u2018Romulus and Remus\u2019, and only missing out on the early modern era by 47 years, the last remnant of the Roman Empire finally ceased to exist.
