            "answer_text": "If Anne had been successful in producing a male heir, she would have been on Easy Street for the rest of Henry\u2019s life - which was only another 11 years \u2014 and probably the child\u2019s Regent until he became of age to rule after Henry died. Jane Seymour may have been one of Henry\u2019s playthings, but very probably not a wife. Unfortunately, the shock of his serious jousting accident (even after she asked him not to participate) led her to a miscarriage on Jan 29, 1536 (ironically, the same day as Queen Catherine\u2019s funeral). Less than four months later, she was executed. The serious jousting accident (leg injury and probable concussion) is theorized to have led to personality changes in Henry, either through traumatic brain injury (affecting his impulsivity and reasoning) or the sheer weight of the uncurable pain in his legs (the smell of the infection was said to be discernable from the next room, by some courtiers.) Anne knew Jane Seymour \u2014 she and Jane had been maids of honor for both the Princess Mary (Henry\u2019s sister) during her brief marriage to Louis XII of France (corrected), and then again as maids of honor to Queen Claude, the wife of Louis\u2019 successor. It\u2019s probably one reason why Jane and her sister, Elizabeth, were accepted as a maids of honor for Anne\u2019s court when she married the king in 1532 (secretly)/1533 (publicly) and birthed the future Elizabeth I 8\u20139 months later. After that, she had probably three miscarriages. She had begun to see signs of Henry favoring Jane (he had gifted her with a locket wth his picture in it), and Anne had discovered Jane perched on Henry\u2019s knee and flew into a rage. None of that would have probably happened if she had had a boy \u2014 she would have been secure enough to remove Jane from court, or probably to just overlook it until the King\u2019s passion had burned out. After her third miscarriage, most people felt that she had \u201cmiscarried of her Savior\u201d, the only thing that would have held her marriage together. Cromwell was happy to make Anne the scapegoat for Henry\u2019s interest in Jane \u2014 and the rest is history. Cromwell\u2019s son, Gregory, went on to marry Jane\u2019s sister, Elizabeth, in August 1537 after Elizabeth asked Thomas Cromwell for help after her first husband died. Cromwell saw an advantage to marrying his son to the King\u2019s sister-in-law, but alas, her sister, Jane, died a few weeks later, and Cromwell himself was executed in 1540 after Henry\u2019s disasterous marriage to Anne of Cleves, which he had helped engineer.

            "answer_text": "If Elizabeth Tudor had been a boy, Jane Seymour probably wouldn\u2019t have even bothered to try to woo the King because there is no way he\u2019d even think of ditching Anne. That\u2019s not to say he wouldn\u2019t have continued sleeping around but he most assuredly would not have been looking for another wife, definitely not. While he\u2019d pursued her, he\u2019d built up in his mind that she was the perfect, son producing woman for him and if she\u2019d been lucky enough to have a boy first go, he would have been crowing to the rooftops about how he\u2019d been so right all along to ditch his first wife for her. Anne never had a choice in this matter, she resisted but eventually saw it as God\u2019s plan for her. She\u2019d have still had enemies but her detractors would have had far less of a leg to stand on if she\u2019d given him a boy straight away. Jane had a go at the king after he\u2019d had a daughter and was very displeased with his wife. She did this with the help of Katherine of Aragon\u2019s and Mary Tudor\u2019s supporters, seizing her opportunity and presenting herself as the perfect woman with their teachings. This would have been utterly fruitless if a son had been had, first go. Anne would never complain about the mistresses, she\u2019d simply do her duty as queen and look out for her son. Henry would very much respect her and she\u2019d be safe. If she\u2019d still had Elizabeth and Jane Seymour had started her overtures, but Anne went on to have a live son, then Henry would have been appeased. Two healthy children, one a son, would have soothed his ego nicely and he\u2019d console himself that he was indeed right to go with Anne. So he\u2019d be no longer interested in a possible replacement and Jane would probably have to retreat. Being a king\u2019s mistress would bring her nothing and she might end up \u2018ruined\u2019 and unable to marry. She might not even appeal to Henry as a mistress as she\u2019d presented herself as the perfect docile, obedient wife. But safe to say, if Anne had given Henry a live, healthy boy, he would not have gotten rid of her. ",
