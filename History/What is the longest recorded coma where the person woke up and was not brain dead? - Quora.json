            "answer_text": "Some politicians have been in office for more than 25 years, but, since you qualified as \u2018not brain dead\u2019, I guess that won\u2019t do. There was a movie about this, a number of years ago, that was based on truth (of course they hyped it up a bit for the movie). I don\u2019t remember it\u2019s name, but basically a person went into a \u2018persistent vegetative state\u2019 not due to brain trauma and survived for many years. An experimental drug was tried and the patient awakened and was \u201cOK\u201d. But the effect was not sustained. They relapsed, and later died. Since then I have read of a few other similar events. A key condition is that the cause of the coma is not be due brain damage, but dysfunction of the brain\u2019s arousal center. ",
