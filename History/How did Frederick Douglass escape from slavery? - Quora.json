            "answer_text": "He disguised himself as a sailor and took the train north.    Douglass was in Baltimore, which although it had a  population of people who were enslaved, it also had a large free population.  It was also close to free states and thus easier to escape, though not without risks.  He put on a sailor's cap, a red shirt and a black scarf which was what sailors wore in that area at that time.   Because many freemen worked as sailors, it was a persuasive disguise.  Plus Douglas knew sailors, and knew ships.  \"I could talk ships and sailing like an old salt,\" he said.   Then he took the train to Pennsylvania.  He was helped by a few things.  he didn't have papers that freemen were required to have, but he had a forged Seamen's Certificate, of the kind that a sailor would have if they traveled to a foreign port and needed to prove they were an American.  Also the conductor didn't study the certificate too well, because he did not match the description on them.    When Douglass became a famous activist and author, groups raised money to purchase his freedom.   This story was only revealed by Douglas s in his life, because to reveal it earlier would have meant he would have had to get the person he borrowed the certificate from and perhaps a few others in trouble.

            "answer_text": "In Douglas\u2019 second narrative, he wrote that he learned trades so his master sent him to work places and at first kept all of the money. As Douglas became more valuable, he cut deals where he was able to keep part of the money. In this way, he actually bought his freedom. Frederick Douglas was an outstanding writer. But his speaking voice softened the most hardened hearts. Many left his speeches convinced that slavery had to be ended ",
