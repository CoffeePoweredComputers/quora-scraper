            "answer_text": "English came from the Anglo Saxons, Dutch came from the Franks, which Germanic tribe did the German language come from? Not \u201ctribe\u201d but \u201ctribes\u201d. After all, English itself came from the Angles, the Saxons, and the Jutes \u2014 three distinct peoples from the North Sea coastlands. According to one theory, German \u2014 High German, that is \u2014 came from the \u201cIstveonic\u201d or \u201cRhein-Weser\u201d people (mainly the Franks \u2014 Weser-Rhine Germanic) and from the \u201cHerminonic\u201d or \u201cElbe\u201d peoples (Swabians, Thuringians, Marcomanni, Quadi, Bavarians, and others \u2014Elbe Germanic). The Rhein-Weser group basically gave rise to the Central German dialects, while the Elbe group gave rise to the Upper German dialects (including Austrian and Swiss). Together these two groups form the High German language. Standard German is based on the East Central German dialects used in official documents around 1500 AD. The German tribes were somewhat fluid as they merged or split over time as a result of warfare, alliances, migrations, and so on. Early Roman writers, for example, refer to Germanic tribes that don\u2019t appear in later histories of the Germans. The large tribes we hear about, e.g. the Saxons, are likely to be confederations of earlier tribes that were united by conquest or alliances. The tribes could also be very mobile. The Langobards (Lombards), for example, were first recorded as occupying part of north-western Germany as a section of the Suebi. According to tribal lore, they originally came from southern Scandinavia. Later they moved south to Austria and Slovakia, and then into north Italy, where part of the region they ruled is still called Lombardy to this day. Back around 500 AD all these tribes would have spoken more or less mutually intelligible dialects of West Germanic. The various Germanic tribes did not speak different \u201clanguages\u201d. Even the Anglo-Saxons seem to have developed most of their unique linguistic features after their migration to Britain. ",

            "answer_text": "The German language is a merger of various pre-historic dialects believed to have been spoken as \u201cproto-Germanic\u201d in southern Scandinavia. It enters history only when people to the south who had writing started discussing German tribes. We don\u2019t know what the early dialects were like; linguistic historians hypothesize an original form that split into all the Germanic languages we know of now. Since people intermarried and migrated and intermarried again we can\u2019t find an \u201coriginal\u201d German speaker, only a given territory later when some Germanic language dialect is taken by us as being \u201cGerman\u201d in our terms. The northern area that the Prussians dominated ended up having prestige but was no more the \u201coriginal\u201d German than the dialect in Bavaria or elsewhere were. ",
