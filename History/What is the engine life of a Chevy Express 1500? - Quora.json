            "answer_text": "If you have a 4.3 V6 250,000 miles would be good. If you have a 4.8L, 5.3L or 6.0L V8 all are LS based engines. Those engines if cared for properly 300,000 is not uncommon. If you drive it like you stole it all the time you will be lucky to make 150,000 miles. Change the oil, coolant, plugs\u2026. and small parts as they fail you will have an engine that will run a long time. I have a 2002 supercharged LQ4 6.0L making over 500HP with over 225,000 miles without any major issues. These are good engines. ",
