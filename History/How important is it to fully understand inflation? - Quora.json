            "answer_text": "It\u2019s Crucial. Everybody should understand the basics of inflation in order to form educated opinions on their country\u2019s monetary and fiscal policies, as well as to properly invest their money so that they are bringing in returns greater than that of the inflation rate. Let me explain,  Inflation is like this rat, it will slowly eat away at the purchasing power of each dollar in circulation. Everything in the economy ranging from goods to services will become more expensive overtime due to natural occurrences that cause inflation. The thing about inflation however, is that wages and salaries rise more slowly than the prices of goods and services, making it difficult for many low-income earners to keep up financially. So how can we use our understanding of inflation to benefit ourselves? Say you are on of the three gentlemen in the picture above. The money being eaten by the rat is money that they have sunken into deprecatory goods/services. Any good that depreciates is one that loses value over time rather than gains value. We need to purchase deprecatory goods on a daily basis to survive however: food, water, gasoline, etc. But it\u2019s the larger purchases that really affect us. See, when you purchase a car for instance, the value of that car decreases each year. On average, a new car will lose as much as 19 percent of its value in its first year of ownership. That means that your $20,000 new car will be worth about $16,200 after just one year. - Trusted Choice Home Page But when you purchase a house for instance, this turns into an appreciatory investment. The price of new homes increased by 5.4% annually from 1963 to 2008, on average. - Michael Bluejay - Official home page Now, we can\u2019t go about living life without purchasing things that depreciate, but we can be more conscious of our spending and saving habits, because it isn\u2019t necessarily our incomes that will protect us from inflation - it is our knowledge of inflation, and the ability to choose sound investments to help protect our money in the long run.  Revisiting the previous image, we now see that the three gentlemen have purchased a house. The money being eaten away by inflation isn\u2019t necessarily money thrown away; it could be used for groceries, electricity, gasoline, etc. But now, because they have a secure long term investment working for them, they aren\u2019t nearly as affected by inflation as they were before. This is the simplest way I can answer your question: The most important part of understanding inflation is to know how to invest your savings in a such a way that you will be earning more than the rate of inflation on income other than your salary. Okay, that was a bit wordy, let me try again. You can\u2019t rely on just your salary to protect you from inflation - you need to save and invest your earnings on the side so that you can make bigger purchases that will keep your assets going up and not down. But here\u2019s the tricky part; just saving your money isn\u2019t enough. You can put your money in fancy RRSP\u2019s or TFSA\u2019s and see little to no results.  Here\u2019s an ad on Google. You indeed have to be high to call a 1.3% interest rate return, \u201chigh\u201d Because inflation tends to run at around 1\u20133%. The Bank of Canada, for example, has had their target inflation rate set at 1\u20133% since 1991. To explain more clearly; if your savings are earning 1.3% and inflation is at 2%, you aren\u2019t making any money, and this is not a good investment. That is why it is imperative to understand inflation when investing - those who don\u2019t, will think an investment like this is going to make them a lot of money in the long run, when in reality, it won\u2019t even make a dent. Now that you understand inflation, and you know that saving your money at 1.3% interest isn\u2019t going to do jack, so what do you do? Well, I would suggest incorporating a little risk into your investment portfolio. There are three main types of Investment: Ownership, Lending, and Cash Equivalents Ownership Investments Ownership investments are what comes to mind for most people when the word \"investment\" is batted around. Ownership investments are the most volatile and profitable class of investment. Examples of an ownership investment include: Stocks Stocks are basically certificates that say you own a portion of a company. Your expectation of profit is realized (or not) by how the market values the asset you own the rights to. If you own shares in Sony and Sony posts a record profit, other investors are going to want Sony shares too. Their demand for shares drives up the price, increasing your profit if you choose to sell the shares.  You can make the most money off of stocks, but it takes a lot of research in not only the companies that you want to invest in, but in the market as a whole. On top of that, the stock market is volatile; no amount of training, expertise, and preparation for a trade will guarantee success, however, if you have more winners than losers in the long run, you can accumulate a decent sum of wealth which can help with a downpayment for a house in the future; an investment which is almost sure to appreciate. Business The money put into starting and running a business is an investment. Entrepreneurship is one of the hardest investments to make because it requires more than just money. Consequently, it is also an ownership investment with extremely large potential returns. By creating a product or service and selling it to people who want it, entrepreneurs can make huge personal fortunes. Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft and one of the world's richest men, is a prime example. Real Estate Houses, apartments or other dwellings that you buy to rent out or repair and resell are investments. The house you live in, however, is a different matter because it is filling a basic need. The house you live in fills your need for shelter and, although it may appreciate over time, it shouldn't be purchased with an expectation of profit. The mortgage meltdown of 2008 and the underwater mortgages it produced are a good illustration of the dangers in considering your primary residence an investment. Precious Objects Gold, Da Vinci paintings and a signed LeBron James jersey can all be considered an ownership investment - provided that these are objects that are bought with the intention of reselling them for a profit. Precious metals and collectibles are not necessarily a good investment for a number of reasons, but they can be classified as an investment nonetheless. Like a house, they have a risk of physical depreciation (damage) and require upkeep and storage costs that cut into eventual profits. Lending Investments Lending investments allow you to be the bank. They tend to be lower risk than ownership investments and return less as a result. A bond issued by a company will pay a set amount over a certain period, while during the same period the stock of a company can double or triple in value, paying far more than a bond - or it can lose heavily and go bankrupt, in which case bond holders usually still get their money and the stockholder often gets nothing. Your Savings Account Even if you have nothing but a regular savings account, you can call yourself an investor. You are essentially lending money to the bank, which it will dole out in the form of loans. The return is pitiful, but the risk is also next to nil because of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Bonds Bond is a catchall category for a wide variety of investments from Treasuries and international debt issues to corporate junk bonds and credit default swaps (CDS). The risks and returns vary widely between the different types of bonds, but overall, lending investments pose a lower risk and provide a lower return than ownership investments. Cash Equivalents These are investments that are \"as good as cash,\" which means they're easy to convert back into cash. Money Market Funds With money market funds, the return is very small, 1% to 2%, and the risks are also small. Although money market funds have \"broken the buck\" in recent memory, it is rare enough to be considered a black swan event. Money market funds are also more liquid than other investments, meaning you can write checks out of money market accounts just as you would with a checking account. Close, but Not Quite Your education is called an investment and many times, it does help you earn a higher income. A case could be made for you \"selling\" your education like a small business service in return for income like an ownership investment. The reason it's not technically an investment is a practical one. For the sake of clarity, we need to avoid the ad absurdity of having everything be classified as an investment. We'd be \"investing\" every time we bought an item that could potentially make us more productive, such as investing in a stress ball to squeeze or a cup of coffee to wake you up. It is the attempt to stretch the meaning of investment to purchases, rather than education, which has obscured the meaning. Not Investments Consumer purchases - beds, cars, TVs and anything that naturally depreciates with use and time - are not investments. As an example, you don't invest in a good night's sleep by buying a foam pillow. Unless you're very famous, and even then, it's a stretch, since you can't reasonably expect someone to pay more for your pillow than the initial purchase cost. Don't take it personally, but there's very little demand in the second-hand pillow market. The Bottom Line Admittedly, it's a clever piece of advertising that removes some of the guilt from impulse purchasing; you're not spending money frivolously, you're investing! The decisive test is whether there is a potential to turn a profit. The important word is \"potential\" because not every legitimate investment makes money. Making money through investing requires researching and evaluating different investments, not simply knowing what is and is not an investment. That said, being able to see the difference between an investment and a purchase is an essential first step. Furthermore, being able to understand inflation and how it will influence your spending habits and earning potential will be a deal-breaker in terms of you being able to accumulate steady long term income aside from your salary. I hope this helped to whoever needs this information and all the best with your future investments!

            "answer_text": "Understanding inflation is probably most important from a long term financial planning standpoint. The purchasing power of a dollar today is not the same as it will be in 10 or 20 years. I think my favorite illustration of this is the Big Mac Index. Not only does the Big Mac Index tell you the relative cost of a Big Mac in another country, but it also shows you the impact of inflation. In 1992 a Big Mac in the US cost $2.19 in 2012, 20 years later, that same Big Mac would cost you $4.20. From a security standpoint having cash and dollar denominated investments such as CD\u2019s, savings accounts and money market accounts is the safest place to put your wealth over a short time period. Those accounts don\u2019t carry the risk of losing value due to fluctuations in the market value like say an investment in stocks or even real estate. We all know the value of stock and real estate can go up and can also go down. So let\u2019s time travel back to 1992 and I have $5.00. I have enough money to buy two Big Macs, but I know that 20 years later, I will be retired and I will be hungry, so I put that $5.00 in the safe and wait until 2012. Now it is 2012 and I have retired and no longer have any income. I am hungry so I open my safe and I still have my same $5.00. The problem is not my $5.00 will only buy me one Big Mac. So what if instead of putting my $5.00 away for safe keeping, I instead risked putting it into buying stock. If I had purchased a Dow Jones index fund for $5.00 in 1992 by 2012 that same investment would be worth $19.28. I could buy several Big Macs along with fries and a Coke with that. So what happened over the 20 years? Well first the cost of a Big Mac went up. That\u2019s inflation. That is the inflation we generally the most concerned about, the increase in cost of general consumer goods we buy. When you hear about Consumer Price Index, CPI, they are talking about how much overall cost of goods went up or down. CPI has pretty much only gone up over the past several decades, so we generally plan on some amount of inflation every year. That means you need to plan on the value of a dollar you have today to be less than the value of a dollar in a year, two years or how ever long out into the future you are planning for. Why do we care about inflation? Well when inflation rates are relatively stable, citizens generally feel pretty comfortable. The money you hold is becoming slightly less valuable over time, but not at such a drastic rate that you can\u2019t deal with it. Wages can increase at a reasonable pace to keep up with inflation so your salary in 2 years can still buy at least as much as it can today. You are unlikely to feel much impact in your purchasing power over short periods of time. If you have money invested in assets, you can expect a reasonable increase in the value of those investments and maybe your investments even stay ahead of inflation. Remember our stock investment earlier. The value of our stock greatly out paced the increase in the cost or a Big Mac, so with money invested we were much better off financially after 20 years. If however, inflation rates increase, then your purchasing power erodes much quicker. It is much more difficult for your income to keep pace with increases in the cost of just living your normal every day life and buying things like food and housing. You can even get to the point of what is known as HyperInflation. Countries such as Venezuela have been experiencing hyper inflation for years. The current rate of inflation in Venezuela is 57%. That means in Venezuela if I have $1,000 today in 12 months it will be worth only $640. To put it another way every day I loose $1 of buying power. That makes for a lot of insecurity for people, because their money is loosing value so quickly. ",

            "answer_text": "I think people don\u2019t consider it enough. Money management firms give you a rosy picture of what your 401K or whatever will be worth when you reach retirement age, BUT their handy charts and calculators don\u2019t take into account inflation. There is bound to be a major inflationary period some time in the next couple of decades. What inflation means is, money saved, supposedly earning interest, really isn\u2019t earning as much as you think. If you are getting, say, a fixed 2 percent, but we hit a period where inflation causes prices to rise, say, 5 percent, you\u2019re actually losing money. We\u2019ve been lucky to not have much inflation the past couple of decades. What inflation may help is real-estate. Say you buy a house now at $200,000 at a fixed mortgage of 4%. If we hit a period of roaring inflation, that rate will be a sweet deal. As well, similar houses will shoot up in price. Hopefully, your salary at work goes up \u2014 so that $800/month mortgage suddenly feels like a bargain! Many businesses are also inflation-resistant. For example, you can just raise prices as your customers\u2019 salaries go up. So I think a truly diverse portfolio includes not only varied types of savings accounts, but also some real estate and maybe owning a small, consistent business or two. ",

For example an investor will buy a private sector bond thats maturity is one year and its yield is %8. if the inf rate will be %9 or more, this bond investment will concluded with loss. Because the bonds real return will be negative. Or a worker Who works for a company must know inflation rate because when the worker bargain for salary hike this information will be important. Because the workers yearly real income increase or decrease is designed by inf rate and salary hike rate. Finally, we can say that inf rate is very important for all economic units. ",

            "answer_text": "Inflation is nothing but the purchasing power of the present money in future. For Example : If a pen Costs Rs. 10 today, the cost of the same pen may or may not be the same in the future. or,If you purchase 5 kg of Rice for Rs.200 Today and after a week for the same Rs.200 you get 4 Kg of same Rice.These above examples depict the impact of inflation or the future value of the present money. Thus, it is very important to consider inflation (present 6%) in all your investments to make proper investment decisions and to know the real money required to achieve ones goals in future. ",

Hence, its not always necessary to understand the whole gamut of things, know what is benefiting to you and your purpose ;) ",
