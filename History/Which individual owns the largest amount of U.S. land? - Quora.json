            "answer_text": "Who owns the most non-federally owned land in the United States of America? The Navajo Nation of course. The land they control and own is located in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. The Tribal Nation is one of three such nations in the united states to control more than 10,000 square miles of land. See, the whole secret to large Indian Reservations, as they are called in the US, is that the natives didn\u2019t start a war with the Americans. The Utes, the Navajo, and the Hopi just wanted to be left alone. The Navajo had migrated south to Arizona following about 30 years of harsh winters and famine. They traveled until they found a place with no other people. and could grow their crops and livestock in peace. For eight hundred years they have continually lived in the same place. In fact. they are likely the longest-surviving unaltered tribe in North America. Now, interestingly enough, since before World War 2, the Navajo have considered themselves Americans, as well as natives. Many of them have served in the US military, many have successful business empires. and others are well educated at many universities. The most common way to meet a Navajo outside of the reservation is in court. There are many Navajo lawyers. In some ways they inspire me, as they are the prime example as to how the rest of the human race should act. They just want to live in peace\u2026 More to consider\u2026 ",
