            "answer_text": "It really wasn't until the 9th century ce, when the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta introduced the formal concept of \"0\" (zero), that our modern way of summing up numbers came into its own.   Brahmagupta Before that time, various ways of keeping track of totals was used, from tic marks in clay to knots on a rope, to numerical characters (which weren't positional).  Most cultures had a concept of zero, but used it merely to keep place in marking off numbers. The Sumerians used both tally sticks (which for animal tallying would be notched with the number of animals and placed in the ground after the night count), to knots on a rope, to marking in clay or other material.  Illiterate peasants, who could be both creditor and debitor, often had a personal method of tallying, usually oly understandable by him. Egyptians used decimal based heiroglyphs for each of the numbers, but couldn't be positioned for easy addition or subtraction, so the method was usually an analog of the actual count, adding ro removing numbers to reflect inventory. Mesopotamians used a sexidecimal system, a used a space in place of a zero, but the zero couldn't be used alone.  And, while the numerical system was positional, the use of the 0 wasn't used at the end of a number, and as such, numbers like 120, 180, 240, ect.. (2x60, 3x60, 4x60) all looked the same simply because it was impossible to provide a way to distinguish them. Simply put, cultures might be able to distinguish a particular number, but couldn't add or subtract several numbers without bascially just counting out the differences. So, as with so much in our modern world, we can all thank our Indian brothers and sisters for a way to keep track of our checkbooks, our inventories and do our homework much faster.

Assigning more than one letter to one numeral and nullifying certain other letters as valueless, this system provides the flexibility in forming meaningful words out of numbers which can be easily remembered. The wiki gives more info. Almost all evidences of the use of Ka-\u1e6da-pa-y\u0101-di system is from south India, especially Kerala. Not much is known about its use in north India. However, on a Sanskrit astrolabe discovered in north India, the degrees of the altitude are marked in the Ka\u1e6dapay\u0101di system. It is preserved in the Sarasvathy Bhavan Library of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, Varanasi. [1] The Ka-\u1e6da-pa-y\u0101-di system is not confined to India. Some Pali chronograms based on the Ka-\u1e6da-pa-y\u0101-di system have been discovered in Burma. [6] Therefore, sometime in the early first millennium is a reasonable estimate for the origin of the Ka\u1e6dapay\u0101di system. [4] Earlier codes also exist for giving planetary periods of various planets in the vedas. These are for secrecy, an unnecessassary botheration which obscures information for nothing. You can see examples in Partha Shakkottai's answer to How was astronomic data hidden in Vedic scriptures? By the look of this I infer the use of zero was already known in Vedic times. The important number 108, occurs all over. The angular diameters of the sun and moon are the same as seen from the earth. (total solar eclipse shows that) The other planetary distances are from scaling with known Dsun=108*Dearth. 108 is considered holy. So were addition,subtraction, multiplication , division, square root and cube roots, the last two needed for alter designs. The last two based on (a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 +2 a b and (a+b ) ^3 = a^3 +b^3 + 3 a b ( a +b) ",

            "answer_text": "Euclids book \u2018Elements\u2019 is a good introduction to how the ancient Greeks were able to perform, and prove, quite complicated mathematics. A lot of maths is simply the ability to add or subtract two numbers. The abacus was a very early \u2018computer\u2019 that allowed binomials to be used and also provide a \u2018memory function\u2019 to add 236 + 57 we add 2 lost of 100 plus 0 lots of 100 =200 then add 3 lots of 10 to 5 lost of 10 to give 80, finally add 6 to 7 which gives 13. As we do not have 13 beads we change 13 to 1 lot of 10 plus 3 so we add 1 lot of 10 to our 80 = 90. The answer is 200 plus 90 plus 3 = 293 Multiplication is simply adding a number x amount of times. Subtraction and division can be handled in a similar fashion. As new questions were posed, new mathematics were introduced. What is 5\u20133: the answer is 2. But to answer what is 5\u20138 ? we have to introduce the concept of a negative. What 1s 12 / 4 ? the answer is 3, but to answer what is 12 / 8 ? We have to introduce the concept of fractions.Then we ask what is square root of 2 ? What is square root of -1 ? For a better understanding of the history of when mathematical techniques were discovered try \u2018Fermets Last Theorem\u2019 or \u2018God Created The Integers\u2019 ",
