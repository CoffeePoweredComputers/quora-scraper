            "answer_text": "Shadows always have been associated with darkness into light - from ancient times, even Biblical. Isaiah 9:2: \u201cThe people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them has the light shined\u201d (King James Version); to the Greek word skotos; to the Germanic and Old English words for shadow or shade (originally, screen or shield from attack). So, like all words containing shadow - and there are many - \u201cout of the shadows\u201d came to mean coming out the darkness - whether it be hiding, depression, captivity, etc., into the light or out into the open.

            "answer_text": "This question has already been answered. Perhaps not as fully as we might like but it provides us with some ideas for areas where we might want to begin our own research. Some people are happy to be fed very specific data \u201c\u2026this idea was first found mentioned in the above form in the earliest writings of the Sumerians\u2026\u201d (I made that up, simply to illustrate my point) Some classics prof might be able to give you a first-known specific mention of the phrase - until an earlier record appears. Written history only goes back 5000 years or so, and that\u2019s just the western stuff. Who knows what else is waiting to be found or what new techniques for dating might overturn certain standard beliefs? Oral history preceded the written records and ideas and metaphors are what we are dealing with here not simple facts and figures. Well, that was a lot of bla bla bla to say \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 ",
