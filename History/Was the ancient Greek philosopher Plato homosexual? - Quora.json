            "answer_text": "First I want to thank everyone who has contributed to this interesting conversation. Sexuality is such an intimate part of our personal identity that we often feel uncomfortable talking about it. Yet it\u2019s such an important part of who we are that it deserves being talked about. That being said, it should also be said that some of the differences of opinion about the question seems to hinge on different understandings of what the question means. One way to understand it takes it to be asking whether Plato would be correctly regarded as a homosexual in modern terms of what we take it to mean. Another way to understand it would be to take it in the sense it would have in the ancient Greek culture of Plato\u2019s day. Clearly it should be legitimate to ask it either way as long as one way of taking it is not taken for the other. That would create needless fallacies of ambiguity in any argument to follow. Leaving the modern way of posing the question aside, I\u2019m going to try focusing on the ancient way where what the question regarding homosexuality is for the most part best seen in the context of pederasty, again a term that can be taken in modern and ancient senses. In the ancient Greek sense of pederasty the couple would likely be composed of a paternal erastes or older adult male and a younger eromenos male perhaps teen ager. It would not typically involve a boy so young that he would not understand the nature of their relationship. Plato\u2019s Symposium gives us a lot of insight into such relationships. For example there is one such couple among the symposium\u2019s seven speech makers whose relationship has survived into their maturity. One of them wants to have the laws of Athens changed to protect, not the very young boys their own fathers keep guard over, but rather the erastes who become infatuated with them. As for Socrates in this dialogue, it\u2019s clear that he flirts with his younger followers to keep their interest and lead them on to his version of philosophical inquiry, namely the self examination of the soul in dialogue with another. But if the confession of Alcibiades at the conclusion of the Symposium can be taken as historical testimony, Socrates had no more interest than his own father in his attempts to seduce him. What then can we conclude about Plato\u2019s sexuality from the Symposium or any of his other dialogues, or any other source of information about him? Absolutely nothing. We can however learn a lot about human sexuality from reading Plato\u2019s Symposium and ultimately about ourselves by using it to examine our own preconceptions about the subject. As put in the slogan identified with Socrates, \u201cKnow thyself.\u201d None of us really know as much about the subject of sexuality as we claim to, and probably least of all about ourselves. ",

            "answer_text": "To answer this, first we\u2019d want to clarify what \u2018homosexual\u2019 means in this context: Had sexual relations with men?Was sexually attracted to men, but without sexual relations?Preferred nonsexual company of men to that of women?Lifelong orientation or temporary phase?Throughout history, many have claimed Plato was homosexual (in sense 1. above) \u2014 usually as an attack on his character \u2014 and many others have claimed he wasn\u2019t. The evidence is very limited and ambiguous: According to a much later biographer, a poem attributed to young Plato mentions his kissing another man.Plato never married or had children.In the Symposium and Phaedrus, philosophical material is presented in the context of a hypothetical man and his younger male lover; however, a central point in these examples is that the lovers should keep their relationship \u2018platonic\u2019.In Laws, a product of Plato\u2019s old age, homosexuality is said to be contrary to nature. Laws is filled with allegory, however, so Plato\u2019s exact meaning here is subject to debate.Again in Symposium, the handsome Alcibiades describes how he tried to seduce Socrates and was firmly rebuffed \u2014 and described in terms that make clear Socrates thought it was inappropriate and a distraction from the more important work of philosophy and moral improvement.In the final analysis, we don\u2019t know what Plato\u2019s sexual orientation was \u2014 and it really shouldn\u2019t matter.
