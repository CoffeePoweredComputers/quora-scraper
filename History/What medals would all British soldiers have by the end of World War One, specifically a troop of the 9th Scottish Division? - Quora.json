            "answer_text": "To be very pedantic, there were no medals that every soldier would have by the end of the First World War. There was a medal awarded to almost every soldier eight months after the war was over \u2014 the British War Medal \u2014 but on 11 November 1918 the soldiers wouldn\u2019t know they were going to be awarded it. The British War Medal was given to everybody who served overseas in the British and Imperial armed forces, for a period of at least 28 days between 5 August 1914 and 11 November 1918. (People who served in the intervention in the Russian Civil War, or on minesweeping duty after the Armistice, were also eligible.) 6.6 million were awarded starting in July 1919. The Victory Medal introduced in September 1919 supplemented the British War Medal. It had similar criteria for eligibility, but you needed to have served in an actual theatre of war, not just garrison duty somewhere like India or Hong Kong. In other words, everybody who received the British War Medal also got the Victory Medal, but the reverse was not true. 5.7 million were awarded. The 1914 Star and the 1914\u201315 Star were two medals awarded to the soldiers who served in the original British Expeditionary Force prior to the introduction of conscription in January 1916. To get the more prestigious 1914 Star you had to have served in France or Belgium prior to 23 November 1914. 0.39 million were awarded. To receive the 1914\u201315 Star you needed to have served in any theatre of war \u2014 not just the Western Front \u2014 prior to 31 December 1915. 2.4 million of these were awarded. The 9th (Scottish) Division was formed on 21 August 1914, but did not cross over to France until 9 May 1915. As such, soldiers who were with the division from the beginning and survived the war would be eligible for the 1914\u201315 Star but not the 1914 one. (Unless they began with a different unit and transferred to the 9th later). The division suffered over 52,000 casualties during the war, which is about a 300% loss rate (in other words, the division was effectively destroyed and re-formed three times over), so not many of its personnel survived the entire war intact.
