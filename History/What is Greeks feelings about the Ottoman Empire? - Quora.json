            "answer_text": "It was beyond the Ottomans to understand the many greek revolts and the spirit of the greek national revolution of 1821 against the Ottomans. But I see that many Turks still have issues to understand the greek revolts and revolutions. Maybe because of the misinformation in schools and media in Turkey who cling almost to the ottoman point of view. To the Greek folklore, cultural stories etc( that could not be influenced from the independent after 1830 greek state) the \u201cTurkia\u201d (ottoman period) was a dark period of oppresion,humiliation and slavery. Many Greeks ,who know only the basics of history, have a hate toward the Ottoman Turks. But the Greeks who know history well have the deepest hate(that possibly a human can have) and anger toward the ottoman empire/state/institution/army. The Turks today teach/think that the Greeks were ungrateful that they wanted their freedom and they revolted against the ottoman oppresors. The Turks also think that it was Russia and Europe who poisoned the hearts of the Greeks/Romioi with ottoman hate. All this could not be further from the truth. The Greeks/Romioi as Romania(byzantine Empire) were one of the most succesful and longvivid states of known history. Much more longvivid than the muslim ottoman empires or the west colonial empires. Romania was overall a peaceful empire, in the sense that they preferred diplomacy and peace and they did mostly wars to defend their people and their land from the invasions of the east and north. Also, greek classical education never stopped in Romania(east part of the Roman Empire) and so the people there were much more educated than in other places of the world and later this was also the main cause for the survival of many ancient greek texts. (Is is true that much more texts would have survived were not for the christian hate toward greek philosophy and paganism , but this is another topic.) Then, after the latin crusade of 1204 and the latin wars , Konstaninopel and the greek/romaika lands were very weak and divided . This was used by the rising Ottoman Turks who attacked and invaded the greek/romaika lands. The Ottoman Turks came as invaders, robbers and murders. They plundred our cities and massacred every population who resisted. Greeks/Romioi never made an agreement with the Ottomans and they never accepted the Ottomans. Even the first years after the fall of Konstantinopel many Greeks/Romioi (as Bessarion the student of the pagan philosopher Gemisto Pletho) went to the european kings and called for a new crusade to liberate Konstantinopel and the other greek/romaika lands . This was a continous call from many Greeks/Romioi abroad . Were they agents of the West? No . They wanted what every person wants. Liberation of your homeland and of your people. Many Greeks became guerilla fighters in the mountaiins and they fought the Ottomans almost in every generation. Many greek mountains were not passable for the Ottomans . The Greeks did many revolts and revolutions . 1821 is not the first revolution! The Greeks did a dozen revolts but often the revolts were uncoordinated and the Greeks were not united. Also the Ottomans had a strong numerical superiority(as always) and so even if the Greeks could kill many Ottoman soldiers , the Ottomans were always able to replace the losses and to bring much greater armies. Priviliges were given to some Greeks/Christians (especially to some high clergy and rich people) in order to make the slavery and oppression less bitter. Some of the clergy supported the Ottomans , because they did not want to lose their privileges and or because from fear of the Ottomans . The mayority of the Greeks/Christians was highly sad and angry about the ottoman occupation and this can be seen also by the many revolts that happened against the Ottomans. Its only that few people(compared to the Ottoman armies ) actually took weapons to fight the Ottomans, because also only few weapons were available. It was forbiden to the Greeks/Christians to own weapons. The ottoman propaganda was/is the focus on the fact that the christians were free to have their own religion . This is true , there were more rights to non muslims in the Ottoman Empire than in Europe to the non christians prior to 1600 or 1700. But this does not mean that the Greeks/Christians were not oppresed or that they did not were second clasd citizens. If we see objective the status of the Greeks/Christians in the ottoman muslim empire, its impossible for you not to hate the Ottomans . Not as a culture, but as a army/military complex/ colonial power. Pact of Umar - Wikipedia All the system was made so that Muslims are superior to Christians and that often Christians are humiliated in order to see that they have the wrong religion. Often , also the muslim ottoman aghas took with force the most beautiful women for their harems. The slight suspicion that some people were against the Sultan (it was their right to be against the Sultan , because the Sultan came with violence and armies ) was sufficient to kill the people . The life of the Gyaurs(unbelievers) was not much worth in the ottoman empire. Even the lifes of the muslims could be taken extremely easily by sultans/pashas/aghas. The doctor of Suleiman the prestigious was killed with the reason that the ottoman army should not know that Suleiman was dead. If the ottoman system was unfair and oppression in theory, in reality it was much much worse, because if you give people power and superior position they tend to use it for their own(Stanford experiment etc) . A corrupt aga or a corrupt pasha could do what he wanted to the rayas and in many cases almost nothing could hinder him . I think all this is sufficient to give proof and to explain why for the Greeks the ottoman period was a dark period and oppresion. The slogan of the greek revolution was \u201cfreedom or death\u201d and \u201cits better to live one hour as a free person , than to live 40 years in oppresion\u201d and many times (as in Mesonolongi) they preferred to die , then to live in this life they lifed. We can see also a part from the greek declaraton of independence. \u201cOur fight against the Ottoman turks has the aim to restore our RIGHTS of our personal freedom, our property and honor thats were taken with violence and murders from the Ottoman Turks from us. Many other european nations have those rights. Its the ottoman tyranny that here that tried with violence to take our rights from us. Do we Greeks have less rights than other people and other nations ? Are we inferior to them and worth of eternal slavery and oppresion , to crawl like animals and automatic machines in the irrational force of the ottoman tyrann , who came as a robber wihout an agreement from a far far place to enslave us. Those inalienable RIGHTS are enbedded from nature deep in the hearts of the humans and no slavery/oppresion , no 3 or 4 centuries , not even 1000 or one million centuries of tyranny can stop those rights, as they always emerge. So we decided to fight against the illegal invader and ottoman tyrann and to take back our rights. And either to earn our rights and to liberate ourselves or to be extinguished , because it will not be worth to live in such a slavery , we the descendants of the ancient Greeks\u201d But even , if the ottoman period would be a paradise of tolerance and money, the Greeks would still hate the Ottomans . Why? Because they Ottomans invaded and attacked them. The Greeks did not attack/harm the Ottomans. The Ottomans invaded and tried to rule the Greeks. Every human loves his freedom and his independence. Its not only about material needs. You will hate the person who wants to rule you and to decide for you and who perceives himself as superior, even if he is the most tolerant and sage person ever. \u201cThey were allowed to trade, move do what ever they wanted to. They lived under protection\u201dWho are the Ottomans /Muslims /Sultan to say to as Greeks/Romioi what is allowed for me and what not? Who are the Ottomans/muslims to allow me something? Is this freedom? Is this independence ? The Ottomans came in my land , in my population as robbers and murders and and then oppresed the people . This was the thinking of the greek guerilla and freedom fighters. And the Ottomans understood that the Greeks/Christians are not Rayah. The fight was not against Muslims in general or Turks . The fight was against ottoman oppresion and tyranny. The Greeks would have preferred to drink coffee with the Ottomans and then say peacefully to them \u201cOttoman soldiers please be so kind to go away, we are free ,independent and people with pride. The muslims populations can stay here peacefully\u201d . Sadly ,this was not an option for the Ottomans and so Greeks had to fight for every inch of land and to earn it with blood and to seal it with much more ottoman blood. Sadly.. Massacres of unarmed moslems did happen during the greek war of indenpendence and it was wrong and many Greeks tried to stop this. But the Ottomans had a long history of massacres to everyone who resists them and also in 1821 it was the Ottomans who started with the massacre of the unarmed Konstantinopel Greeks , the unarmed Smyrna Greeks and the unarmed Chios Greeks and many Greeks were furious and responded. The greek revolution of 1821\u20131830 was not caused by the French, Russians , British. This is extremely wrong to say and sadly the turkish school history books even teach tha the russian emperor was behind the greek secret revolutionary society \u201cfiliki etairia\u201d. This is also wrong. The French,British, Russian goverments were initially extremelly against the greek war of indenpendence because the Europeans represented the order of Wien congress that was very antirevolutionary and so the Greek war of independence was perceived (wrongly) from them only a social revolt. It was much later that the european kings were persuaded by the european folks (who admired the spirit of the greek revolution and their love for freedom) and by the inability of the Ottomans to suppress the Greeks , to get involved in the conflict. 800,000 crazy Greeks without a modern army, cavalry or artilery defeated and humiliated the ottoman turk empire of 30,000,000 and from 1821\u20131825 every ottoman army was decimated and humiliated by much smaller greek armies(battle of Dervenakia, battle of Vasilika, battle of Arachova etc) and the ottoman navy was destroyed by small greek fireships . It was then , when the Ottoman Turks called for help the Egyptians and it was the egyptian (Ibrahim pasha) army in Moria who was the main trigger for the Europeans to get involved and then for the russio-ottoman war. \u201cIts better to have my weapons and my knife, than to live as a coward and to kneel before the oppressor. (Its better) to press my cretan knife in the belly of the Turk, even if somewhen I will get killed. I cannot endure anymore the slavery in this world. Its bitter for me to live and happiness to die\u201d song of the Greek Cretan freedom fighters Kolokotronis was the leader of the greek revolution (1821\u20131830) and he was perceived as a terrorist and criminal by the Ottomans like always the freedom fighters against Nazism and against every colonial force are perceived as terrorists. When the Ottomans said to Kolokotronis that he should surrender and bow down to the \u201cfaithful\u201d army of the \u201cmercyful\u201d and \u201cjust\u201d Sultan, Kolokotronis responded \u201cI asked my d..ck and it said no. Then, I asked my di..ck again and it said again no\u201d PS. The greek war of liberation was , is and will be an inspiration not only for all Greeks but for all freedom loving people in the world. The hate and the rage of Greeks(and of all the balcan people) was and is mainly against ottoman state/occupation and ottoman sharia discrimination. Greeks will always defend their borders and their rights against tyrannical oppresors and robbers who want to steal land from others and some politicians who may dream about neoottoman empires should study well the 1821 greek revolution/decimation/ humiliation of the Ottoman Turk armies. That being said, the greek revolution was not against Islam in general or Turks in general. Many modern Greeks have warm feelings towars the Turks as many modern Turks want peace and disagree with the ottoman deeds. Greeks and Turks are neighbours and we should develop more and more our good relations and overcame the hate of the past . Greeks and Turks , do not believe the mass media blindly , we should search personally if some infromation about our neigbours is correct. There is alot of misinformarion and propaganda about Greece in Turkey and about Turkey in Greece. But of course ,sine qua non condition of good relations is respect for the borders and of the rights of the neighbours . Also Turks can see the past more objectivily(and many brave Turks do this) and condemn ottoman muslim colonalialism as the Western people overall condemn western colonialism. Turks can/should be proud at their culture (as all people should), but all humans have to disagree with every colonialism/occupation, even if our ingroup did it. I mean Greek or Turk,Christian or Muslim etc. I cannot understand how one cannot condemn ottoman (and every) occupation if he approaches the issue objectivily. I wish Freedom and Peace to all . ",

            "answer_text": "Their feelings is that they fell under an extremely barbarian nation, the Turks, who had no regard for civilization and advancement of humanity. Other nations and empires conquered the Greeks, like the Romans, but they adopted the superior Greek civilization, language, arts, philosophy, science and other things in great part for themselves as to make the Greeks themselves Romans, until the capital city and the Roman empire fell to the Ottoman Turks in the year 1453. The same way happened to China a few times, China was conquered by the Mongols one time and by the Manchurians another, by those conquerors adopted the superior Chinese civilization and they became Chinese themselves. The Ottomans were the opposite of the Romans, they were destroyers of civilizations, and not only the Greeks but every other Christian nation that had the misfortune to fall under them, became like slaves. In contrast to the Romans who adopted for themselves the Greek Gods, the Turks were not permitting equal rights to non Muslims, they did not learn the Greek language, they did not study the ancients. The Arabs at least studied and advanced and expanded their knowledge about the ancient Greeks. When the educated Greek-Romans (Byzantines) left in mass after the fall of the empire and went to Italy and the west, they brought their ancient knowledge with them and they transmitted it, this caused the explosion of knowledge and this was the reason that the renaissance and the modern age of reason and science was born. While this happened in the west the Greeks fell into illiteracy and Turkish barbarism, instead of being first in the human advancement they fell down between the last. They still carry today in their psychology and way of thinking the weight of the 400-500 years of Turkish Ottoman subjection. This is the feeling of the Greeks about the Ottoman Empire, the bitterness that this empire kept the Greek nation going backwards for half millennia, while the rest of the world was advancing. On top of this, modern Turkey committed ethnic cleansing and genocides in the 20th century by exterminating the Greek and other nations that were living in Asia Minor for thousands of years , they occupy one third of Cyprus and they still act as an outlaw and barbarian nation.\u2014 ",
