            "answer_text": "The tsar on horseback, blessing Russian troops during World War I. The fate of tsarist Russia and its ruling family was bound up in the tragedy of World War I. Russia was drawn into the war by the same follies and errors of judgement that affected the other great powers of Europe: imperial rivalry, poisonous nationalism, military overconfidence, too much trust in alliances and not enough in diplomacy. But while Russia entered the war for similar reasons to her European neighbours, she did not do so on an equal footing. Russia\u2019s economy was still developing and reliant on foreign investment; her industrial sector was incapable of competing with the powerhouse German economy. Three years of total war would exhaust the Russian economy and leave its people starving, freezing and miserable. From this soil, the February Revolution would spring. Though Russo-German tensions dated back decades, Nicholas II believed that family ties precluded any chance of a war between the two empires. Nicholas and the German kaiser Wilhelm were cousins; Wilhelm and Nicholas\u2019 wife Alexandra were both grandchildren of Queen Victoria of England. The relationship between the Russian tsar and the German kaiser was strained at first but they later became good friends, addressing each other as \u2018Nicky\u2019 and \u2018Willy\u2019 in communications. Nicholas thought it highly unlikely that the kaiser would declare war on the kingdom of his own relative. What the tsar did not count on was Wilhelm\u2019s own duplicity, nor did he appreciate the forces of war that had been building in Europe for more than ten years. The alliance system demanded that nations support their allies if one was attacked. This placed the tsar in a perilous position between the Balkan nation of Serbia \u2013 a nation with close political, ethnic and religious ties to Russia \u2013 and Austria-Hungary and Germany. When the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand was shot dead in Sarajevo in June 1914, it triggered a wave of threats, ultimatums and troop mobilisations. By August, Serbia had been invaded by Austria-Hungary and Russia had declared war in response, prompting the German kaiser to declare war on his Russian cousin.  A postcard showing a crowd greeting the tsar outside the Winter Palace, August 1914. As well as the growing international crisis, Nicholas II also had pressing domestic concerns. Anti-government sentiment and unrest had been building since 1912, when tsarist troops butchered hundreds of striking miners at Lena River. By mid-1914 the number and intensity of industrial strikes was approaching 1905 levels. Fed up with low wages and dangerous conditions, workers at the remote Baku oil field walked out in June. When news of this reached St Petersburg it triggered worker unrest there; the capital was hit by 118 strikes in June alone. At the beginning of July, around 12,000 workers from the Putilov steel plant \u2013 the same factory at the heart of the \u2018Bloody Sunday\u2019 protests \u2013 marched in the capital, where they were fired on by tsarist soldiers. Two were killed and dozens injured but the government\u2019s response was to deny the incident happened. This culminated in the great general strike of July 1914, which paralysed more than four-fifths of St Petersburg\u2019s industrial, manufacturing and commercial plants. One right-wing newspaper described the situation as revolutionary, saying \u201cWe live on a volcano\u201d. It took the outbreak of war in early August 1914 to douse this militancy. For a few weeks at least, the grievances of workers were doused by a rousing wave of patriotism. The tsar, who weeks before had been jeered and despised, became the subject of nationalistic affection. As one observer put it, to hate the Germans was easy but to hate the tsar became an act of national betrayal. Days after the Russian declaration of war, Nicholas II and Alexandra \u2013 ironically of German birth herself \u2013 appeared on the balcony of the Winter Palace, to be greeted by thousands of people on bended knees. When conscription orders were distributed in the capital, more than 95 per cent of conscripts reported willingly for duty. The tsar too was changed by the events of August 1914. In the months prior he had shown little interest in the affairs of state, but both the war and the revival of public affection reinvigorated Nicholas, who threw himself into his duties. \u201cRight from the beginning of hostilities I have never been able to find out anything about our general plan of campaign. [Years before] I was acquainted with the general plan in event of war with Germany and Austro-Hungary. It was strictly defensive and in my opinion ill-conceived from many points of view, but it was not put into execution because the circumstances forced us into an offensive campaign for which we had no preparations. What was this new plan? It was a dead secret to me. It is quite possible that no new plan was ever established at all, and that we followed the policy determined by our needs at any given moment.\u201dGeneral Brusilov The tsar\u2019s renewed fortunes did not last long, however. Russia\u2019s war effort began poorly and soon exposed some critical problems in how the army was being commanded, organised and equipped. Russia mobilised millions of troops quickly, indeed more quickly than their German enemies had expected \u2013 but many were not adequately prepared or supplied. Thousands of Russian infantrymen left for the front without critical equipment, including weapons, ammunition, boots or bedding. Some historical accounts suggest as many as one-third of Russian soldiers were not issued with a rifle; their standing orders were to pick one up from a dead colleague when the opportunity arose. In late 1914 Russia\u2019s general headquarters reported that 100,000 new rifles were needed each month, but that Russian factories were capable of producing less than half this number (42,000 per month). Soldiers were better armed with prayers and penitentials, as Russian Orthodox bishops and priests worked busily to bless those about to go into battle.  Russian prisoners of war after the Battle of Tannenberg, 1914. The Russian army\u2019s shortfall of equipment was compounded by poor leadership from its generals and officers. The army began an invasion of German East Prussia in the first month of the war but were defeated at the Battle of Tannenberg (August 1914). The Tannenberg campaign was riddled with tactical blunders. Russian officers sent out battle plans uncoded over radio, while the Russian generals leading the offensive (Samsonov and von Rennekampf) despised each other and refused to communicate. The Russian army suffered 30,000 casualties at Tannenberg while another 100,000 soldiers were taken prisoner. A week later the Russians suffered even heavier losses (170,000 casualties) at the Battle of the Masurian Lakes, which forced them to retreat from German territory. Russian offensives against the weaker Austro-Hungarians were more successful, allowing them to push across the Carpathians and into Galicia \u2013 however the arrival of German reinforcements in May 1915 again forced the Russians to retreat. By the autumn of 1915 an estimated 800,000 Russian soldiers had died, yet the Russian army had failed to gain any significant territory. Public morale and support for the war was dwindling; Russians became more receptive to anti-war rhetoric and propaganda, much of it disseminated by the growing Bolshevik movement. In August 1914 the Russians were forced to order a massive retreat from Galicia and Poland. The outraged tsar made a telling error, removing his army commander-in-chief, Nicholas Nicholaevich, and taking command of the army himself. Nicholas\u2019 generals and several of his civilian advisors opposed this move. They reminded the tsar that his military experience was confined to cavalry training; he had no practical experience of strategic warfare or commanding infantry and artillery in combat. But the tsar, bolstered by encouragement from his wife, proceeded to the front. Nicholas\u2019 decision to take command of the military did not have a significant effect on Russia\u2019s war effort; he rarely intervened or countermanded the decisions of his battlefield generals. What it did do was to link the tsar with his generals, making him responsible for any and every military failure. It also abandoned Russia at a time of domestic crisis, the reins of government left with Nicholas\u2019 ministers but the whip left in the hands of his wife. Two years of war also had a telling impact on Russia\u2019s domestic economy. The conscription of millions of men produced a labour shortage on peasant landholdings and a resultant decline in food production. Large numbers of peasants were also moved to the industrial sector, which generated a slight rise in production but nowhere near enough to meet Russia\u2019s war needs. The war placed Russia\u2019s transportation system under enormous strain, as engines, carriages and personnel were redeployed to move soldiers and equipment to and from theatres of war. Inadequate maintenance and replacement of this infrastructure caused it to fail. By mid-1916 an estimated 30 per cent of Russia\u2019s railway stock was unusable. This had a severe impact on Russia\u2019s cities, which relied on railway shipments for their supplies of food and coal. Short of reserves to fund the war effort, the government resorted to printing excess paper currency, which in turn led to inflation. By late 1916 inflation had reached almost 400 per cent. ",

Princip was one of a group of six assassins (five Serbs and one Bosniak) coordinated by Danilo Ili\u0107, a Bosnian Serb and a member of the Black Hand secret society (that's still active nowadays) which was an anti-Austrian group that encourages a nationalist movement against Austria-Hungary. This triggered Austria who had interest in the Balkans inevitably to take action of Serbia, cus the govern of Serbia know this would happen and take no action. On 6 July 1914, Germany supported Austria -Hungary with a blank cheque to gave unlimited support, this encouraged Austria-Hungary to demanded an ultimatum of 3 terms to Serbia, suplress all anti-Austrian societies, dismiss all officials Austria-Hungary objected to, officials of Austria-Hungary were to enter Serbia to suppress anti-Austria activities and to carry out an investigation of the assassination, which means Austria-Hungary can freely decide who is involved in the assassination. Serbia accepted the first to but not the third one. Russia, which was claimed to be the \u2018Big Brother\u2019 -who want to encourage Balkans towards independence so Russia could increase its influence on them, of the Balkans of course support Serbia which is in the Balkans . This triggered German and Austria-Hungary against Russia and Serbia. Then British France Italy joined, caused the ww1, entente power and alliance power, blah blah blah\u2026. ",
