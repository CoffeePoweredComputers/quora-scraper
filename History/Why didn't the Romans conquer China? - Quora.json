            "answer_text": "Motto: Roma invicta  Masters of the economy There were other markets throughout the city of Rome such as the market of the subura quarter for the poor Romans which mostly sold vegetables and chickens and which was mostly frequented by slaves. There were also neighborhoods with luxury shops such as the ones found in the Campus Martius. The market was huge. It contained many kinds of shops, shops that sold food, spices, shoes, wool, books, etc. There were barber shops, blacksmiths, etc. The forum boarium right next to the main market was a huge meat and cattle market while the forum cuppedinis sold luxury goods. The Romans realized the importance of the meaning of economic realm. When the Romans have decided to go out of Europe to England they were working with sophisticated economical instruments, like credit letters, promissory note, insurance policies, pool investments, commodities futures, common investment in commodities and people transport companies, exchanged in a free market the documents of property in order to debt cancellation. Public bankers called the mensarii were introduced in 352 BC. The nummularii or the officers of the mint held a bank that put new coins into circulation. Actually many of the nummularii's functions were the same as the argentarii's: they exchanged foreign currency for Roman currency, they held deposits and lent money, they participated in auctions and large commercial transactions, they made payment of behalf of clients and executed payments abroad through local bankers, also held money and paid interest just like banks do today. And just like banks today they used that money in other profitable transactions or investments and acted as agents. The Romans were the masters of the economy over western Europe, North Africa, and Middle Orient, money, as an instrument of payment, has had a limited circulation role, gold, land, industry, means the real wealth. The army was integrated into the economy mostly in insurance activities, from the public activities n the cities to cargo transports.  At the moment that the Roman army generals intended to make a war campagne to conquer new territories, they had asked the magnates and lord lands for money to raise a new army, with all what this activity means. This means a lot of money for a risky intrepid adventure. There was limited information about England and limited free people on roman territories who accept to risk their lives. New Economic Scheme After the generals surmounted the human problem by bringing enough people from East territories as Dacia and Tracia, have begun the next problem: the equipment and arms, from boots to arrow. Next problem was how long time will occur the war, because of this problem depend on the number of people, the quantities of equipment and arms, and finally the quantity of money for soldiers payment. Now the problem goes to magnates and lands' lords to manage to find the way to collect the money in an economy that currently doesn't use the money, and they have asked their financier clerks, slaves with financial abilities, the question. The financier clerks, slaves, produce the financial answer: to sell options over the future territories.  The habit of Romans people to betting on all kind of elements was the source of this brilliant idea. They have explained the options idea as an underlying asset or instrument at a specified strike price on a specified date. Option So this financial operation has begun, all free people can become a landlord in England with a little sum of money, or he can lose the money, but the risk was low because they believe in Roman generals and the Roman army, and more, the money goes to a financial pool with a date of settlement. At this point, a lot of former soldiers enroll themselves with out of payment but in the exchange of this kind of asset, the option over a piece of English land. An option was viewed as a bet, and more this tip of bet accept two ways: - to own the right to buy, a specific dimension of land in England, at a specific price is referred to as a call; - to own the right to sell, a specific dimension of land in England, at a specific price is referred to as a put.  Scheme Class The magnates and lands' lords have accepted the idea and have launched options over the future territories they will conquer in England. More, to give a widespread for this financial instrument, the magnates and lands' lords guarantee the buyback, the today Risk Return, so the owner of an option, call or put, may on-sell the option to a third party in a secondary market, today named over-the-counter transaction. Usually was commonly accepted that this third party was food seller, and the secondary market was in the commodity market, for the common people. For the high class, it was the financial market to accept listing on the market the options and transfers together with other sophisticated economical instruments, it was a today Scheme Class. You have known by now about the finish of England adventure, it was a financial crack, no more words, and this is why the Roman Empire have remained on shore of Mare Nostrum to exploit their lake. That why the Romans didn't conquer China.

Why can't a college student in Dallas beat me in a fist-fight? Because he's on the other side of the bloody planet and has no reason to be aware of the possibility of me existing. This really should be pretty much the most obvious thing ever. How could one possibly even need to ask it?? ",
