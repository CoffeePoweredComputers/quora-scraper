            "answer_text": "They all spoke Western Germanic languages. But there are 3 subdivisions within that sub-branch. Saxon, Frisian & Anglic (Scots & English) are North Sea Germanic or Ingvaeonic languages. The modern day decendants of the Franks: Dutch, Flemish & Afrikaans are Rhine-Weser or Istvaeonic languages. Standard Written German, Alemannic (Swiss), Austro-Bavarian, Thuringian & Yiddish are Elbe or Irminonic languages. So the ancient varieties like Cherusci, Chatti (Hess), Suebi (Schwabia), Lombard, etc. belong to this last category.
