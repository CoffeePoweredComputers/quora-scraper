            "answer_text": "What ancient weapon could possibly beat today's weapons? Well, a Brown Bess is a MUCH better bayonet holder than an M16   But if you give one round of ammunition to both combatants, then I\u2019ll put my money on the guy with the M16, every time. If you give them each 30 rounds of ammunition? It stops being a contest at all. To paraphrase another Quoran, who was quoting a Drill Instructor during bayonet training \u201cYou only use your bayonet when you have no ammunition left.\u201d If you have any ammunition left at all, then you shoot your enemy, no matter how close to you they are. Even if they are in bayonet range, you still shoot them if you have ammo. So the fact that Brown Bess is a better bayonet platform is completely irrelevant in modern warfare. Ok, lets try again. In the 15th or 16th century, European armorers perfected armor.  Cool. Total invulnerability to all bladed attacks, basically no encumbrance.  Well\u2026 shit. Lets try this again\u2026  There is no weapon better than this for fighting an opponent in heavy armor. (Like the suit above. I said invulnerability from bladed weapons.)  \u2026 except for these: 7.62 NATO perpetrator rounds. Put \u2019em in an M24 or an M240 and no one in personal armor stands a chance. Even if you said that I have to fight one of these guys  Even if they are wearing their XSAPI plates in their vests Small Arms Protective Insert - Wikipedia I\u2019d still rather go after them with a 7.62 firearm (rifle if I must, but I\u2019d prefer the machine gun if I can get it) than with a pole axe. In short, there is no weapon from any time in history that is better than the weapons that we have today. ",

            "answer_text": "Greek Fire If anyone could re-discover the formula it would be a formidable weapon and the only thing that would be effective and feared by a modern military. It burns on any surface and cannot be put out by water. Similar to come chemicals we see today like white phosphorous but in a liquid form.  Truth be told all weapons from those days still kill very well. Most ranged weapons of that time period have obvious effective range and accuracy issues granted most weapons we think of were melee weapons that would be effective in trained hands but getting into close range would be near impossible. Several hundred Archers firing a volley of armor-piercing \u201cplague\u201d or fecal matter dipped arrows would be deadly.  Ballistas would still penetrate the best body armor today. Granted they might only get one shot off before being decimated yet, still effective.  Black Powder or Gun Powder was invented by the Chinese around 1000 AD. the Chinese had all sorts of cool devices and weapons that utilized this in various forms and of course explosives can still kill troops in soft armor. Since black powder can be used in so many creative ways this and Greek fire should be the worst of the lot.  ",
