            "answer_text": "There was no need or desire to continue that design philosophy. The Tiger was what one might call a super-heavy tank, extremely well armored but at the price of extremely limited mobility. Post-war military thinking called for a main battle tank (MBT) that coupled good defense with good firepower and better mobility. As one of the better German panzer generals of WWII noted more than once (paraphrasing heavily here): speed is the most useful attribute of a tank, followed by firepower and then by armor. It is best to get to the battlefield before the enemy, and even better yet before the enemy even knows where the battlefield IS; it is good to get there early AND be farther from the enemy than he is from you (by having better tank guns with longer range); and it is useless to get to the battlefield with great armor and a powerful gun, but get there too late to make a difference. So the Tiger family of tanks was, rightfully in my opinion, relegated to history as new model names were chosen to grace the more advanced German models which evolved to render it truly obsolete. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually Germany still uses feline names for tanks. But we do not have a Tiger anymore as that tank-design is pretty much outdated. :-D Leopard I (outdated) and Leopard II (current) are the more common ones (MBT).  Then we got the Cheetah (Gepard). An AA-tank.  Then the Bundeswehr uses several other mammal predators: Like the Fox-tank (APC):  And the Marten-tank (APC):  And I even got a canine vehicle for you: The Wolf! It\u2019s actually Mercedes\u2019 G-Class:  And the upgraded version: The Raccoon-dog Enok! G-Class as well:  ",
