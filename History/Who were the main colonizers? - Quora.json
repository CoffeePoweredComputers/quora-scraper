            "answer_text": "Well, once the age of exploration began The Monarchy's of Europe, with the most assets to finance the initial outlay, ships, sailors, marines, ( English vessels) food, amoury, doctors, helmsmen, cartographers, batering stock and a huge petty cash box. These so called explorers were nothing more than greedy land grabbers and under subjugation they stole any assets including human beings in the name of who gives a f..k! Remember, that the investors expected a return on their money. Sorry, to your question. Number 1 was Great Britain \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7. Their vessels were vastly superior to anything else being built. Their ability to discover more than others as well as steel land from other European countries. Britain literally raped the economies of raw materials, precious metals, as well as precious stones. Britain until the early 1830\u2019s profited from slavery! Hehe, the British people would brag saying the sun never set on the British Empire. Britain stole so much from it\u2019s colonies , it became the richest powerhouse in the world. Sorry, I can\u2019t give you more, as history showed. ",

            "answer_text": "In the beginning, the Spanish and Portuguese colonized first which sparked the race to America. England colonized places but after the unification of Britain, they became a power. France too but after the 7 years war, they lost all of North America. France gained back their lands as well as Spain after the American Revolution. Spain's colonial empire died after Napoleon invaded Spain. The Dutch and Danish all made some colonial progress. Especially in India where the British, French, Dutch, Danish, and Portuguese all started to make colonies there. Britain would control India after long wars with native Empires. The race of Africa saw the expansion of the French, Belgian, German, British, Dutch, and Italian empires. Spain did make African colonies which were then lost. After WW1 France, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Portugal held Africa. After WW2 all these European powers started to let go of their colonies. So to answer the main colonizers would be the British, French, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese. They made lasting effects on their colonies, unlike other European powers. They also had big empires. ",
