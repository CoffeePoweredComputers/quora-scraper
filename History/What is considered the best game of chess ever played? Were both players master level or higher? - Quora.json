            "answer_text": "What is the best game today may not be tomorrow, not because a recent tournament game has just shown up to displace it but because ever more powerful chess algorithms find flaws in the previous master game. In The Golden Dozen, Chernoff selects https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1012099 as the greatest game ever played (Alekhine considered it one of his two best games.) As Chernoff states, \u201cQueens and rooks are given away with a lavish hand by Alekhine. He lets Bololyubov capture a queen and two rooks in three successive moves - the last with check!\u201d A truly great game\u2026 and then the flaws were discovered. Later analysis showed Alekhine missed best play so Chernoff\u2019s greatest game ever now has warts. And this can easily happen to whichever game is currently in vogue as the best game ever. Chess engines can now look further into a game than humans are able and tomorrow\u2019s engines will look further still. But maybe the best game really isn\u2019t the most flawless. Maybe it\u2019s the one where a move is so subtle, or maybe so startling, that even if later play has an error or two, that one move elevates it to a position of true greatness. Using that criteria, I\u2019ll toss out a game that may be the most analyzed in history and for which the outcome with best play is still in doubt, Bird vs. Morphy https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1027914. Morphy makes a rook sacrifice, Bird doesn\u2019t make best play and loses the game. But even today, after decades of analysis by humans and computers, no one knows if the sacrifice is sound or not. The last I saw was a reference to some Russian analysis that Morphy gets a winning position but that is now a few years old and the pendulum might have again swung (if you follow the analysis over the years, it goes back and forth with every refutation of the sacrifice being later refuted.) Is this the best game? It all depends on what you mean by best. Maybe it\u2019s not the best in the usual definition, certainly not the least being Bird walking down an unpromising path, but it\u2019s certainly one of the most interesting games ever. It\u2019s also a peerless example of Morphy\u2019s insight over the board, making a move that\u2019s so deep that his opponent, and all later humans and computers, were and have been left scratching their heads and CPUs trying to fathom a satisfactory reply.

            "answer_text": "What is considered the best game of chess ever played? Were both players master level or higher? Any great game should involve two great players. A great many of Morphy\u2019s games are flawed - mainly because he faced a boatload of inferior players. It doesn\u2019t remove his skill. But it isn\u2019t a great game when a great player pounds an inferior player who is hanging pieces and overlooking checkmates. One of my candidates for the greatest game ever is Byrne-Fischer 1963 US Championship. Mainly because half-way through the game, the position was almost completely symmetrical and only 10 or 11 moves later, Byrne resigned while Grandmaster commentators in the next room were saying Byrne was winning. At the point of resignation, Black doesn\u2019t even have any pieces past his 3rd rank. And yet, White is helpless against the coming attack. [White \"Byrne, R.\"][Black \"Fischer, R.\"][Result \"0-1\"][ECO \"D70\"]1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.g3 c6 4.Bg2 d5 5.cxd5 cxd5 6.Nc3 Bg7 7.e3 O-O 8.Nge2 Nc6 9.O-O b6 10.b3 Ba6 11.Ba3 Re8  after 11. \u2026 Re8 \u2014- note that only the e and f-files are not symmetric. NORMALLY this means both sides have very similar playing opportunities at this point. But 10 moves later, White is devastated. 12.Qd2 e5 13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.Rfd1 Nd3 15.Qc2 Nxf2 16.Kxf2 Ng4+ 17.Kg1 Nxe3 18.Qd2 Nxg2 19.Kxg2 d4 20.Nxd4 Bb7+ 21.Kf1 Qd7 0-1  Byrne resigns as he can do nothing. Fischer writes: \"A bitter disappointment. I\u2019d hoped for 22.Qf2 Qh3+ 23.Kg1 Re1+!! 24.Rxe1 Bxd4 with mate to follow shortly.\" Another candidate for greatest game ever is the 5th game of Spassky-Fischer world championship in 1972. [White \"Spassky, Boris V\"][Black \"Fischer, R.\"][Result \"0-1\"][WhiteElo \"2660\"][BlackElo \"2785\"][ECO \"E41\"] 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Nf3 c5 5.e3 Nc6 6.Bd3 Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6 8.e4 e5 9.d5 Ne7 10.Nh4 h6 11.f4 Ng6 12.Nxg6 fxg6 13.fxe5 dxe5 14.Be3 b6 15.O-O O-O 16.a4 a5 17.Rb1 Bd7 18.Rb2 Rb8 19.Rbf2 Qe7 20.Bc2 g5 21.Bd2 Qe8 22.Be1 Qg6 23.Qd3 Nh5 24.Rxf8+ Rxf8 25.Rxf8+ Kxf8 26.Bd1 Nf4 27.Qc2 Bxa4 0-1  With this move, Black offers White a free bishop with poison on it. But no matter what he does next, Spassky is either mated or loses material. With this game, Fischer evens the match and in subsequent games completely outplays Spassky. When the two highest rated players in the world play each other and one so completely dominates, the result is pure chess magic. ",
