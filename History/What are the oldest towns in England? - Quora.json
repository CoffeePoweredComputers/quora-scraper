            "answer_text": "You specify England, so that rules out Brodgar in the Orkneys (which may have been more of a religious community rather than a town). Stonehenge is slightly younger at ~5000 BCE. It is hard to imagine something on that scale being constructed without considerable community resources, and that community would have to live in a settlement or settlements. Whether you consder them as \u2018towns\u2019 - that\u2019s hard to judge. I bet they didn\u2019t have a mayor and town council. Ceasar mentions defended settlements like Wheathampstead - it had a wall but was it a \u2018town wall\u2019? The oldest definitive record is for the Roman settlement of Colchester in 77 CE, but there must have been Iron Age settlements big enough to qualify. Or even pre-Iron Age. And then we come to \u2018merry\u2019, and that\u2019s a problem. People can be merry sometimes and miserable the next but given that ale has been brewed since Stone Age times, you could say any town could qualify as merry. Then again, hops were not introduced until the 15th century - perhaps that should be the start date? With the Black Death truly over, business expanding and Chaucer contributing, I\u2019ll put the start date there. ",
