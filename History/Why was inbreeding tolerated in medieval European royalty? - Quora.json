            "answer_text": "2 reasons 1st point; It\u2019s not that bad Hold on, before you down vote me to oblivion, I\u2019m not advocating incest, im merely stating facts. The \u201cinbreeding\u201d you think of was mostly arranged from distant cousin marriages. These really aren\u2019t so bad, and have numerous advantages royalty would have seen good in a marriage. The first is genetic sexual attraction: Though it wasn\u2019t very known back then, distantly related people will feel sexual attraction to each other, especially if they\u2019ve never met before. In most noble marriages back then, the bride and groom never met each other until the wedding day. Now, this isn\u2019t always the case, I\u2019m generalizing. 1a) The genetic lottery; Royalty were generally taller and fitter in the time. If you breed two related people, there is a chance you might just get that one in a million child, who gets perfect family characteristics. There is a reason animal breeders often inbreed. It is not completely negative. Inbreeding heightens the effects of both positives and negatives. Breeding two royal family members means they both have the positive effects. This is why sheep breeders use inbreeding (not sibling breeding)quite often. We can see this in the hapsburgs. Because of their tendency to marry in the family, they all got that horrendous jaw. This is because a great majority of the ancestors have this trait. That was an example of a negative effect of inbreeding, but there were plenty of positives. For example, if you have a family that has a tendency to make tall children, a tall father and a tall mother from the same royal family, you get a really tall child, due to many tall ancestors. The child will also have a distinct look, resembling both the father and the mother due to both having similar ancestors. Thats a good thing, right?(ignore the hapsburgs) I\u2019d just like to mention that said cousin marriages weren\u2019t as common as you may think. They weren\u2019t common at all, and were relatively rare. It would take multiple generations of cousin marrying to be truly \u201cinbred\u201d(like the hapsburgs) My 2nd point is that all breeding is inbreeding. All humans are distantly related to each other, some just more related than others. Obviously, siblings are the most related. The \u201cinbreeding\u201d we see in royalty isn\u2019t like that. Well, egyptian royalty did have a few sibling marriages, but thats not medieval. (Again, Im not trying to advocate incest, just stating fact) Edit: Let me specify what I mean by \u201cinbreeding.\u201d specifically when I said \u201ccow and sheep breeders\u201d. I don\u2019t mean sibling or niece/nephew breeding, I mean more like distant common ancestor. A great example of this distant cousin marrying is King Ferdinand of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Leon and Castille. Both members of the Royal House of Trast\u00e1mara. (apologies for the Wikipedia citation, its just so terribly convenient) They were distant kin. So, their issue are \u201cinbred\u201d right? But\u2026 did we ever hear about that? Not as much as the hapsburgs famous inbreeding. Granted, the hapsburgs were a lot more incest-like. Still, why ignore one and chastise the other? If incest is so bad, surely all counts are the same. Ps.. Take a shot every time I mention the hapsburgs P.p.s Hapsburgs aren't completely medieval. Their heyday was in the renaissance. ",

            "answer_text": "In Spain, marriages within the 4th degree were banned between 1550 and 1917, the so-called Consanguinity Laws. Different countries started to ban such things at different moments and to a different degree. And these differences exist even today. At most places, \u201cinbreeding\u201d in the sense of something truly illegal only prohibits full siblings or parent-offspring, i.e. spouses with 50% degree of relationship (basically a simple estimate for the fraction of DNA that is identical for the two people). Note that clones and identical twins have 100%, full siblings have 50%, parent-offspring also have 50%, grandparent-grandkid have 25%, and there are other percentages. The royal families generally liked inbreeding at some moments \u2013 first cousins etc. \u2013 and it may have good reasons. When the genes are taken \u201creally from the family\u201d, that could have guaranteed the most aristocratic genes for the kids. And this argument is surely correct to some extent. Some problems may arise and have arisen but it\u2019s questionable whether the negatives exceed the positives when an aristocratic house considers itself \u2013 or is considered \u2013 as really special. Today, most people would say that the inbreeding is just bad, even for cousins or 2nd cousins etc., and the desire to preserve the aristocratic genes should be secondary (or, more radically, the special nature of these families is a superstition). But most of the contemporary people say so mostly because they\u2019re not aristocrats and they have been taught to despise aristocracy \u2013 or at least not consider aristocrats as exceptionally good people. Things were different centuries ago. Aristocrats surely considered themselves special most of the time; and so did most of their subordinates, in fact. Even though the consanguinity laws were active at most European countries, the royal families often got exceptions directly from the Pope which was enough. ",
