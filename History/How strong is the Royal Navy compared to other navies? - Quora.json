            "answer_text": "Surprisingly strong. The Royal Navy, the key component of Her Majesties Naval Service currently has 77 commissioned vessels. These include: Six daring/type 45 destroyers, widely considered as the most advanced destroyers in the world. Armed with: Anti-air missiles: Sea Viper air defence system1 \u00d7 48-cell Sylver A50 VLS, for a combination of 48:Aster 15 missiles (range 1.7\u201330 km) Aster 30 missiles (range 3\u2013120 km). Anti-ship missiles:2 \u00d7 quad Harpoon launchers. Guns:1 \u00d7 BAE 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mk 8 naval gun, 2 \u00d7 Oerlikon 30 mm guns, 2 \u00d7 Phalanx CIWS, 2 \u00d7 miniguns, 6 \u00d7 general purpose machine guns Thirteen Duke class/type 23 frigates. These ships are known as one of the most versatile, and adaptable vessels in the world. It is world leading in anti-submarine operations. It is armed with: Anti-air missiles: 1 \u00d7 32-cell Sea Wolf GWS.26 VLS canisters for 32: Sea Wolf missiles (range 1-10 km). Anti-ship missiles: 2 \u00d7 quad Harpoon launchers. Anti-submarine torpedoes: 2 \u00d7 Twin 12.75 in (324 mm) Sting Ray torpedo tubes. Guns: 1 \u00d7 BAE 4.5 inch Mk 8 naval gun, 2 \u00d7 30mm DS30M Mk2 guns, or, 2\u00d7 30mm DS30B guns, 2 \u00d7 Miniguns, 4 \u00d7 General purpose machine guns Three amphibious warfare ships. One of these includes an aircraft carrier, HMS Ocean, based on the invincible class. The other two are of the Albion class. Each of these ships can carry around 800 marines, aircraft (ocean can carry 18). They can carry multiple tanks, armoured vehicles as well as boats used for amphibious landings. Mine hunters/countermeasures. The Royal Navy currently has 16 of these. The American navy has said multiple times that the gulf would not be secure if it wasn't for these fantastic ship and their crews. Senior American officials have even gone as far as saying, that they would not allow the Brits to get rid of them. Now that's sayin something. The sixteen ships are made of eight different ships from two classes (the hunt class and Sandown). Offshore patrol/corvettes. Are ships similar to corvettes. The Royal Navy has one permenalty stationed in the Falklands. There are four ships of the river class. In addition to this, there are fast patrol boats, with 18 of them in service. Submarines. The submarine service currently have 11 submarines in active service. These include 4 SSBN\u2019s (nuclear/ballistic missile submarines, armed with 16 trident nuclear missiles). There are then a further 7 nuclear attack submarines of the aging trafalger class, and the new (and some say one of the best submarines in the world). These subs can attack land targets as they did during the Afghan and Iraq wars. Survey ships. The Royal Navy operates five survey ships of various classes for use in hydrography, oceanography and meteorology roles. One of these ships, HMS Protector is an icebreaking vessel, is armed and is the UK\u2019s ship to protect its assets in Antarctica. Classic vessels. The flagship of the first sea Lord, HMS VICTORY is the oldest Commissoned warship in the world. It is now a museum in Portsmouth, England (home of the Royal Navy). Training ships. HMS Bristol a unique ship of the Bristol class/type 82. In addition to Royal Navy ships, the fleet is supported by an MOD/civilian/merchant marine organisation called the Royal Fleet Auxillery. These ships are armed with multiple weapon systems, it's crew trained to Royal Navy standards (during wartime they become Royal Navy reservists), and are involved in counter-narcotics, piracy and counter terrorism roles across the world. However, their main purpose remains to be to resupply the fleet with whatever they need. Wherever the Royal Navy is, the Royal Fleet Auxillery is. They operate: Seven replenishment (resupply) vessels. Ships are from the wave class, rover class, fort Victoria class, and fort rosalie class. They deliver vital support to operations through RAS (replenishment at sea). They are armed with a variety of weapons including machine guns, anti-air/ship weapons and cannons. Amphibious warfare. Yes, three of the UK\u2019s amphibious warfare ships are operated by the RFA. These ships come from the Bay Class. These ships can carry four landing craft, and 700 Royal Marines. They are armed with ten machine guns, Phalanx CIWS (anti missile system), and two cannons. There were four ships of this class until we sold one to Australia for amphibious warfare use. Hospital ship/helicopter training. RFA Argus, one of my personal favourite ships in the world. It was originally designed as a helicopter ship, but is now in wartime and emergencies used as a hospital ship. In peacetime it is a helicopter training vessel. It was deployed to Sierra Leone during the Ebola outbreak as a hospital ship. Forward repair ship. Clues, in the name. RFA Diligence, is the only ship of this type. On top of this, the MOD has sealift ships on long leases. In wartime, these vessels which are capable of carrying 130 tanks, and Can carry up to four helicopters including Chinnok, Merlin and Lynx. There are four of these large ships, in the point class. Of course, on top of this, the Royal Marines operate multiple craft (if anyone is interested, look up list of Royal Marines watercraft). The problem is, many people look at our fleet and think \u2018oh well they haven't got as many ships as the US or China, and therefore aren't very good\u2019 well I've got advice for those people: look beyond the numbers and look at the ships we have. They are the most advanced ships, crewed by the best trained sailors in the world. Quality, over quantity. And another thing: don't just look at the Royal Navy and think it ends there; look at Her Majesties naval service and the MoD ships. Even all the RFA ships have a lot of Royal Navy crew. And if you still don't think the Royal Navy are strong right now, just look at the ships we've got coming over the next few years: the massive 65,000 ton super carriers of the Queen Elizabeth class, of which we will have two in service. On top of this, the new type 26 Global combat ship, and the even newer type 31 multi role ships will be starting to come into service over the next ten years. And there will be quite a lot of them. The answer: It isn't right to base a navy on the amount of ships they have on its own. You should base it on the amount of brilliant ships they have. The US for example, has the a large amount of really good ship. But in terms of the amount of good ships, and the ships in the fleet, the Royal Navy has got to be the second strongest. According to numbers, Russia is. But come on. None of their rusting ships can leave port without a tug with them. Sad fact, but true. That doesn't mean Russia isn't still powerful, however. Next up would be China. Yes they are developing a Large fleet, and yes they are building good ships, but they don't compare to the ships the Royal Navy has right now. Maybe in a few years, they would do. But with our new aircraft carriers, we will just make their fleet look weaker anyway. Same with Russia. Then, hopefully, countries across the world will see the Royal Navy is rising up again. Si vis pacem, para bellum If you wish for peace, prepare for war\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I will stick to a realistic and practical answer . The British Navy is reasonably strong and can be ranked after the Americans,Chinese,Russians,Japanese,Indian and French Navies. Let me compare 4 of the major frontline warship in this regard - Aircraft Carriers, Submarines, Destroyers and Frigates. Aircraft Carriers - US has over 11 of the largest and most advanced Aircraft Carriers in Service. India has 2. Russia ,China and France each have 1. Japan and Uk currently have none. Submarines - US has over 70 Nuclear Powered Submarines. Russia and China have over 60 each , a mixture of Nuclear powered and Conventional Submarines. Japan has 17 Conventional but very advanced and modern Submarines. India has 15 Submarines including 2 Nuclear Powered and 13 Conventional. France has 10 Nuclear Powered Submarines. Uk has 11 Nuclear Powered Submarines. Destroyers - Now this is where Uk starts lagging behind. Uk has just 6 Modern Destroyers called the \u201cType 45\u201d. Unlike Top end Destroyers, these Destroyers are not Multipurpose/Multirole. They excel only in Airdefence . Their Anti-ship capabilities is practically none while Anti-submarine capabilities are non existent. Furthur more , the propulsion system of these Destroyers are defective causing them to occasionally break down mid sea.Type 45 Destroyer towed back to port after break down However back to numbers , US has over 65 Destroyers, Japan has over 25,China and Russia have around 20 each ,India has 11 and France has 2. Frigates - Again Uk massively falls behind here. Uk has 13 Frigates called the Type 23, an outdated design which was first commissioned 27 years back in 1990. They have completed their design life of 25 years and in desperate need of replacement. In comparison, China has over 30 Frigates, India and France have around 15 ,Japan has 10 and Russia has 6. US does not use Frigates as they are inclined more towards Destroyers and Lighter Corvettes. ",
