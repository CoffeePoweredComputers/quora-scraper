            "answer_text": "It depends on what the \u2018nation\u2019 is like, what it has gone through, its demographic make-up, the number ethnicities living in it - if any, the number of religions, and the relationships between all of these variables. In strict sociopolitical terms, nation building is essential for state building. Meaning that if you\u2019re trying to build a modern, successful nation around the center of rule of law and solid institutions, the people living in the country must first have a sense of belonging to this place, and an understanding of what its borders represent. Nation building involves many activities, and it can be a top-down process, that is, enforced by a central government through activities such as assimilation of ethnic groups, enforcing an official language in education and public affairs, an official religion, a national dress, a code of conduct, et cetera. Or it can be bottom-up, when that national idea is endorsed by poets, artists and public figures. Historically, most efforts by governments toward building a national idea involved the recruitment of artists and popular public figures to aid in the process. Countries like Indonesia, Tanzania, and Singapore are successful examples of nations that didn\u2019t exist a few decades ago, or ever before that. Countries like Kenya and Nigeria are bad examples, because the national idea never managed to supersede other types of loyalty (tribal, family, ethnic group, religion, and so on). Countries like Egypt and China have existed for the longest time as polities, and therefore barely needed any actual work toward the formation of national pride, and therefore national sentiments. You get the idea. ",

            "answer_text": "Nationalism is a subset of Patriotism, where a patriot loves his country but remains critical and aware of it\u2019s flaws.Nationalism is ignorant to the country\u2019s flaws and darker sides, and defends it even when it is wrong. Most major nations in history that fell, did so because of strong feelings of nationalism. Rome, Spain, The British Empire, Germany, The USSR, to name a few of the more popular ones. In short, few countries survive when the population have nationalistic views. They tend to loose sight of themselves, fight among the other citizens calling them unpatriotic or anti-country. This internal struggle tends to isolate people not in the strong culture, forming strong prejudices, and eventually tearing the company apart. All countries have some nationalists, ultimately it is not healthy however, and if the nationalist mentality gets to strong, it tends to spell the end of the country. As long as the nationalists do not gain too much power a nation can survive, when they gain to much power (usually a result of fear or anger) the country starts to destabilize, and if not correctly will eventually collapse.

            "answer_text": "A certain level of nationalism is essential for a nation to function well. A nation without these emotions is quite vulnerable when it comes to defending your country, because people think they\u2019ve got better things to do \u2026 Nationalism and national states are of course the product of this 19th century fashion of establishing these (large) sort of a people\u2019s organization. In smaller scale, a tribe would never survive without it\u2019s micronationalism. Nationalism can make people proud being what they are, but it can make them dreaming of supremacy also. This is the next level, when nationalism becomes agressive and hostile. ",

            "answer_text": "Nationalism is a sense of belonging. We humans need to belong somewhere,be it a community or a country. If you don\u2019t feel like you belong to your nation, how can you do good for it? Nationalism is the foundation for a united nation. without it a country would fall apart. It is not the nationalism but the neo-nationalism we need to worry about. ",
