            "answer_text": "According to that story, the Egyptian king was willing to let them go a number of times but Moses\u2019s god kept hardening his heart to prevent him from doing so. Do the people who believe such stories represent reality actually read them? Old Yahweh had Moses jumping through hoops on a task he set and then prevented him from succeeding time and again, so that, what, Yahweh could be the big hero helping the Hebrews escape? This god is supposed to be all-powerful. If I were such an entity and I wanted a group of people elsewhere I would just teleport them there. After such an event, there would hardly be nay sayers in that crowd of Hebrews so the 40 years in the wilderness to tame the stiff-necked would have been unneeded. Heck Yahweh could have just teleported the Hebrews into their promised land and teleported anyone in the way of that relocation back over to Egypt to take their place, no? And, doesn\u2019t anyone else think that Yahweh is being a dick for favoring his Chosen People over other peoples? What does he have against all of the people living peacefully in Canaan that he orders the Hebrews to \u201cKill them all, and their little dogs, too!\u201d Isn\u2019t Yahweh the god of all? Doesn\u2019t He love all of his children? Apparently not. ",

            "answer_text": "Moses himself didn\u2019t convince anybody. If it had been just Moses and Aaron demanding the release of the Israelites, it would have been a resounding failure and the Jews would probably still be slaves in Egypt today, or have been assimilated into Egyptians over time.  No, it was the God of Moses, Aaron and the Israelites, who identified himself at Exodus 3:13\u201315 as \u201c\u2019Jehovah the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the the God of Jacob\u2026This is my name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered from generation to generation\u201d\u2019\u201d who convinced Pharaoh to release the Israelites, by means of ten devastating plagues of supernatural origin. These plagues humiliated the gods of Egypt, demonstrating their impotence to protect their worshippers and, finally, even the heir of Pharaoh, himself considered a god.  This was in part to facilitate the release of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery, and partly to make His name known. As Exodus 7:5 records, God said to Moses: \u201cThe Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out from among them.\u201d   Pharaoh\u2019s refusal to acknowledge Jehovah and to obey his commands, is recorded at Exodus 5:2 - \u201cBut Pharaoh said: \u201cWho is Jehovah, that I should obey his voice to send Israel away? I do not know Jehovah at all, and what is more, I will not send Israel away.\u201d God\u2019s intervention is matters was at least partly to answer this challenge of Pharaoh - he would have to know that God was, and is, Jehovah. The sanctification of God\u2019s name is a primary issue, and one that Jesus taught his followers to pray for, when in the model or Lord\u2019s prayer, he instructed them to pray for the hallowing, or making holy, or sanctifying of God\u2019s name, Jehovah. That that remains an issue is indicated by God\u2019s words to Ezekiel: \u201cI shall no more let my holy name be profaned; and the nations will have to know that I am Jehovah.\u201d\u200b Ezekiel 39:7 https://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/questions/gods-name/ ",

            "answer_text": "It was actually God who forced Pharaoh to let the people of Israel go. Through ten plagues he challenged the Egyptian deities, their false gods, and brought his people out of the house of slavery. Moses was only the hand of God for deliverance. In fact, the Israelites wouldn\u2019t even listen to Moses until he and his brother Aaron showed signs that God told him to show them (Exodus 4:29-31). Moses himself didn\u2019t even want to face Pharaoh. Four times he asks the Lord to choose someone else (Exodus 3:10-4:13). God\u2019s power in these plagues showed the Egyptian gods and Pharaoh that God is the true God. Each one of the plagues affected one of the Egyptian deities. It was an immediate challenge to their false gods and idols, their magicians who tried to copy some of the plagues, and Pharaoh whose stubborn heart hardened against the Lord. It took the death of his firstborn son for him to finally stop playing around with the Israelites and letting them go. Even then, he chased them into the Red Sea and lost his own life and army. He was never truly convinced that the Israelites should be let go. He was so hardened to Moses\u2019 message from God and all of the signs and plagues that it cost him everything. The whole drama began with Israel only asking for a few days in the wilderness to worship the Lord. He refused to grant even that, and it turned into God freeing Israel completely. ",

            "answer_text": "Marc Lawrence has a good answer. I would add: Moses had a speech impediment, so the guy doing the talking to Pharaoh is his brother, Aaron. Oh, god tried to kill Moses when he entered Egypt as an 80 year old man, because Moses was not circumcised. The tenth plague was the killing of the firstborn of Egypt, most of whom had nothing to do with enslaving the Jews, it was god getting revenge on the Jew\u2019s behalf. It was the tenth plague that god had in mind all along, as he regularly hardened Pharaoh's heart against Moses\u2019s requests. A non-literal reading of the tenth plague is that god did not want the Jews to kill Egyptians in revenge, so god did it, except that god did not really do so, he was demanding a higher moral behavior of humanity. Since it was people who wrote the Bible, it was people demanding moral behavior of people. Of course, none of this happened, it is a fable, there is no evidence of a large Jewish presence (much less enslaved presence) in Egypt during the presumed time periods or any time before Jews were well-established in Israel. Many of the events (such as talking bushes, some of the plagues, especially the tenth plague, the parting of the Red Sea) are impossible. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Roksana Parvin Yasmin. It was the demonstration of Jehovah\u2019s power that convinced the Pharaoh to release the Israelites. Before bringing the plagues on Egypt and delivering the Israelites from slavery, Jehovah told the Israelites what he was about to do. They would see Jehovah\u2019s power demonstrated in ways that they had not previously witnessed, and the Egyptians would certainly know who Jehovah is. When God\u2019s promises came true, the faith of the Israelites was strengthened, and this helped to counteract the false religious influences they had been exposed to in Egypt. By means of the plagues he visited upon the Egyptians, Jehovah humiliated and executed judgment upon their gods. (Exo 12:12) The first plague, the turning of the Nile and all the waters of Egypt into blood, brought disgrace to the Nile-god Hapi. The death of the fish in the Nile was also a blow to Egypt\u2019s religion, for certain kinds of fish were actually venerated and even mummified. (Ex 7:19\u201321) The frog, regarded as a symbol of fertility and the Egyptian concept of resurrection, was considered sacred to the frog-goddess Heqt. Hence, the plague of frogs brought disgrace to this goddess. (Ex 8:5\u201314) The third plague saw the magic-practicing priests acknowledging defeat when they proved to be unable by means of their secret arts to turn dust into gnats. (Ex 8:16\u201319) The god Thoth was credited with the invention of magic or secret arts, but even this god could not help the magic-practicing priests to duplicate the third plague. The line of demarcation between the Egyptians and the worshipers of the true God came to be sharply drawn from the fourth plague onward. While swarms of gadflies invaded the homes of the Egyptians, the Israelites in the land of Goshen were not affected. (Ex 8:23.24) The next plague, the pestilence upon the livestock, humiliated such deities as the cow-goddess Hathor, Apis, and the sky goddess Nut, who was conceived of as a cow having the stars affixed to her belly. (Ex 9:1\u20136) The plague of boils brought disgrace to the gods and goddesses regarded as possessing healing abilities, such as Thoth, Isis, and Ptah. (Ex 9:8\u201311) The severe hailstorm put to shame the gods who were considered to have control of the natural elements; for example, Reshpu, who, it appears, was believed to control lightning, and Thoth, who was said to have power over the rain and thunder. (Ex9:22\u201326) The locust plague spelled defeat for the gods thought to ensure a bountiful harvest, one of these being the fertility god Min, who was viewed as a protector of the crops. (Ex 10:12\u201315) Among the deities disgraced by the plague of darkness were sun-gods, such as Ra and Horus, and also Thoth the god of the moon and believed to be the systematizer of sun, moon, and stars.\u200b\u2014 Ex 10:21\u201323 The death of the firstborn resulted in the greatest humiliation for the Egyptian gods and goddesses. (Ex 12:12) The rulers of Egypt actually styled themselves as gods, the sons of Ra, or Amon-Ra. It was claimed that Ra, or Amon-Ra, had intercourse with the queen. The son born was, therefore, viewed as a god incarnate and was dedicated to Ra, or Amon-Ra, at his temple. Hence, the death of Pharaoh\u2019s firstborn, in effect, actually meant the death of a god. (Ex 12:29) This in itself would have been a severe blow to Egypt\u2019s religion, and the complete impotence of all the deities was manifested in their being unable to save the firstborn of the Egyptians from death.\u200b Finally, the Pharaoh had enough and he let the Israelites go. According to some estimates, three million people, including Israelites and \u201ca vast mixed company\u201d of non-Israelites and Egyptians, were spared God\u2019s judgment and left Egypt.\u200b\u2014 Ex 12:38.

            "answer_text": " Moses does no such thing!! There are 20 accounts covering the hardening of Pharaohs heart, ten Gods doing an 10 Pharaoh did himself, consequently, Mose had nothing to do with the actual release. \u201cAnd I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God. And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand. And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go. And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.\u201d Exodus 3:17-21 \u201cAnd I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.\u201d Exodus 7:3-4 \u201cAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the Lordhardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.\u201d Exodus 11:9\u201310 It seems unjust for God to harden Pharaoh\u2019s heart and then to punish Pharaoh and Egypt for what Pharaoh decided when his heart was hardened. Why would God harden Pharaoh\u2019s heart just so He could judge Egypt more severely with additional plagues? First, Pharaoh was not an innocent or godly man. He was a brutal dictator overseeing the terrible abuse and oppression of the Israelites, who likely numbered over 2.0 million people at that time. The Egyptian pharaohs had enslaved the Israelites for 400 years. A previous pharaoh\u2014ordered that male Israelite babies be killed at birth. \u201cAnd the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.\u201d Exodus 1:15-16 The pharaoh (Tutmose II) God hardened was an evil man, and the nation he ruled agreed with, or at least did not oppose, his evil actions. Second, on least a couple occasions, Pharaoh hardened his own heart against letting the Israelites go: \u201cBut when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had said.\u201d Exodus 8:15 \u201cAnd Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.\u201d Exodus 8:32 God and Pharaoh were both active in one way or another in the hardening of Pharaoh\u2019s heart. As the plagues continued, God gave Pharaoh increasingly severe warnings of the final judgment to come. Pharaoh chose to bring further judgment on himself and his nation by hardening his own heart against God\u2019s commands. As a result of Pharaoh\u2019s hard-heartedness, God hardened Pharaoh\u2019s heart even further, allowing for the last few plagues and bringing God\u2019s full glory into view (Exodus 9:12; 10:20, 27). Pharaoh and Egypt had brought these judgments on themselves with 400 years of slavery and mass murder. Since the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23), and Pharaoh and Egypt had horribly sinned against God, it would have been just if God had completely annihilated Egypt. Therefore, God\u2019s hardening Pharaoh\u2019s heart was not unjust, and His bringing additional plagues against Egypt was not unjust. The plagues, as terrible as they were, actually demonstrate God\u2019s mercy in not completely destroying Egypt, which would have been a perfectly just penalty. \u201cFor the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.\u201d Romans 9:17-18 ",
