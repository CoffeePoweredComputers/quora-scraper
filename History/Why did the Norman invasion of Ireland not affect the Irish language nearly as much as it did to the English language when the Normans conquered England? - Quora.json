            "answer_text": "Good question. My opinion would be that when the Normans invaded England they quickly achieved a secure base, after the Battle of Hastings, then headed to London, then every other major English town, to secure them. They knew of major towns and settlements and therefore knew where to go. York for example was a well known place. Ireland would not have been so well known. Dublin of course and Wexford were obvious places to dominate quickly, but further west into the interior, would have been less well understood as places of importance. The conquest would have therefore been slow and gradual and, it appears, the native Irish were much less hostile so we have no record of a Hastings where \"the flower of Saxon England fell\" The Normans imposed a cruel and violent imposition of their ways in England, taking land and booty and left a swathe of destruction in northern England. Ireland did not seem to have suffered the same. The language would therefore have survived for a very long time. Were told also that the Normans were in fact, assimilated into the Irish culture and ways. That must have included Normans learning Irish. The opposite of what happened in England. The important element is that the Norman Conquest of Ireland took a much longer time and was not such a hostile takeover. ",

            "answer_text": "When the Normans invaded Ireland they only held the East Coast securely, the rest was under Gaelic control, notably the O\u2019Neills. Many Normans such as the Bourke/Burke family assimilated into Irish life and adopted Gaelic instead of French. It got so bad that in the 15th century a law was passed by the English monarch that said that no Englishman may marry an Irishwoman and vice versa. By the early 16th century the only Irish territory held by England was known as the Pale( Dublin). In fact Dublin was held by the English crown( later British) for over 700 years roughly. In England, the Normans has a secure grasp on the English and were quick to get rid of the titles of many Anglo-Saxon elites and gave them to Normans to help maintain power. This led to French( and later Middle English) being the domain and cultural language that every poet would aspire to write in. In Ireland this never happened and the Gaels retained their titles until the Cromwellian invasions of the late 17th century. ",
