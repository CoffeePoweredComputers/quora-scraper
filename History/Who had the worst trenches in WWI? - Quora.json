Partly because in theory, the Germans had taken a bite out of France and could just stay there, whereas the allies had to maintain the idea that there trenches with temporary, and they would be advancing to take back the territory Germany was now occupying.

            "answer_text": "Generally on the Western Front the allies did for two main reasons After the end of mobile warfare and the first battle of the Marne in 1914 the Germans executed a huge withdrawal across France as they moved to fighting a defensive war and holding onto the occupied parts of France and Belgium - this gave Germany the choice of where to build their defences - they naturally chose the best ground which generally meant the higher ground - as the allies advanced to contact they were forced to dig in parallel to the Germans, which meant that the allied trenches would always be wetter than the Germans who were on higher groundThe Germans saw trenches as the \u201cnew frontier\u201d of Germany and were determined to defend it so build ever more elaborate and better trenches, the allies objective of the war was to evict Germany from the occupied parts of Belgium and France and sitting defending a trench could not achieve that aim so the allies had no option but to fight an offensive war which means trenches as essentially seen as temporary jumping off points foe the next attack",
