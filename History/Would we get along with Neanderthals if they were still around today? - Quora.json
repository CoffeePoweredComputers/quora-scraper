            "answer_text": " Note the very prominent brow ridges framing the eyes. Note the high sagittal crest at the top of the skull. Note the receding chin. Note the receding forehead. Note all the skull mass/length behind the jawline. Note the angle of the jawline. Note the rather strong nose bone, and huge nose opening. A large male Neanderthal was about 170 pounds and about 5.5 feet tall. So, most recent artistic conceptions worked to make them look as much like a modern person as possible \u2026 using beards to hide the receding chins, hair style/hats, etc., to hide the receding forehead and crest at the top of the skull, fore angles and so forth to prevent seeing all the rear skull areas, and shadowing and angles to help deemphasize the large bone ridges around the eyes, etc. The older reconstructions went too far the other way, making them look far too \u201cape-like\u201d. So, dressed in nice suit, with the right haircut and accessories \u2026 you\u2019d probably accept one of these guys as human in a crowd unless you looked too closely. They WERE definitely people \u2026 just not EXACTLY like sapiens. The later stage Homo erectus were basically us \u2026 but the Neanderthals evolved from early/mid stage erectus, and simply went another direction. :D So, that said, they were visibly different. Some had dark skin, some had light skin, some had olive skin, etc \u2026 just like sapiens \u2026 and, if some of us simply looked like that, we\u2019d probably accept it as part of human variety. Given how we tend to label those different than us, I can\u2019t say we\u2019d \u201cget along\u201d \u2026 but, given history, we\u2019d probably have effed them to extinction the way we did the first time. :D ",

            "answer_text": "We must have \u2018gotten along\u2019 at some point as those of Eurasian descent still carry a portion of their DNA but the competition exclusion principle states that when two similar species compete for the same resources and territory, only one will go onto survive. Darwin\u2019s study of finches demonstrated how when similar species are forced to compete for the same resources in a given territory, they can also adapt by diverging genetically and evolving ways to eat different foods within that same territory. He noticed finches with larger beaks preferred to eat larger seeds and others with smaller more refined beaks preferred to eat smaller seeds. This divergence reduced the competition and allowed a variety of subspecies to co-exist. Coming back to the Neanderthal and Homo sapiens competition, the biggest problem was that the two species were both omnivores who relied heavily on hunting big game - which were known to fluctuate from year to year as the climate changed. Another set back to the poor Neanderthal cousin was that Homo sapiens had a wanderlust that took them around the planet in a short period of evolutionary time. This would have increased the competition for food even further. Researchers like Chris Stringer* mention the tool making advantages that Homo sapiens had developed (throwing spears instead of jabbing spears, sewing tools to tailor clothing), but he also purports that it was the large group strategy adopted by Homo sapiens that afforded them the greatest advantage. Neanderthals apparently lived in smaller family groupings and so would have been at a huge disadvantage when an extra large band of hungry Homo sapiens came along. The theory is that Neanderthals were pushed out of the better hunting territory and many suffered from starvation (as is evidenced in the fossils). A variety of computer simulations were run to demonstrate the competition between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens. Using population numbers and tool advantages etc. as the variables, Neanderthals lost in every version of the simulation. So, in short, the only way that the two species would have been able to survive together all along the way into the present age is if one species became strictly vegetarians who liked to live only on remote tall very cold mountains and that if that species also developed an adaptation to the cold and high altitude (like the Tibetans). Still, that would have given them a temporary advantage but it would not have made them bullet proof from the threat of extinction because, even if they were safe from outside attack, any population constrained geographically has a very hard time to maintain the necessary genetic variation to sustain their population size and health through hard times. Having said that - if we could just plop them into the modern age without their having had to fight their way to 2019 - well Neanderthals would look very similar to us - but even then - it\u2019s hard to predict whether they would remain genetically different enough or would be genetically swamped once again?
