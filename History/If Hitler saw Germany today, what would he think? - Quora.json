            "answer_text": "I`m shocked most people here believe Hitler would be only slightly upset or even content. I`m surprised to the point that I must question the knowledge of history of some of the posters / voters. I believe he would be absolutely livid, appalled and mortified. The current state of affairs is beyond his worst nightmare. It is the complete antithesis for what he stood for, and then some! He`d be shell shocked to see how people view him these days, especially given his egocentric nature. He thought history will prove him right, he would be horrified. He might have a stroke seeing an ethnically diverse Europe / Germany with open borders and immigrants coming in, with the progressist worldview embracing LGBT, globalism and multiculturalism, and with Jewish people still in positions of power. He`d see his Aryan race dream shattered into pieces. He would puke at the sight of the immense, almost unchallengeable power that social democracy & the parliamentary system has become. He`d wonder how it was possible and where is the national spirit? The territorial losses and the state of the German army would probably kill his soul. I doubt the German economy would impress him in the slightest, given that it`s based on internationalism, globalism, and that the whole world economy is more or less a house of cards anyway. I actually think he would loathe the state of the economy, or at least the foundation on which it stands. He`d probably see Germany somewhat similar as he saw it after WW1 - a vassal state betrayed by its own people, relying on international finance. A state which stays strong just because the Aryan race is so much superior, and still not tainted too much. But that`s just in terms of economy & military. Overall, he`d see it much, much worse, and he`d be shocked that most people condone the current state of affairs. He would take some solace in the heavy decline of communism, but it won`t be much rejoicing given the fact that it outlasted his ideas and that it`s still far from being dead. He would enjoy the technological advances, but he would also be frustrated by them, thinking that the Germans were close to achieving some of them in the `40s, and they could have benefited. I could see him thinking that the German / European people deserve their fate and that there`s nothing left to be done anymore, before putting a gun to his head again in utter disappointment and hatred towards the ppl. ps: not to mention other stuff like animal cruelty, german flag, architecture, no german space program, independent view about certain lost territories etc ",

            "answer_text": "He would be both pleased and disappointed. Hitler\u2019s actions affected not just Germany, but all of Europe and the world. Things he liked: The Eurozone, the idea that Germany and other European nations are using the same currency would be seen by Hitler as a positive development. He wanted it to be the Reichsmark, but the euro seems a good compromise. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. Hitler hated communism and the fact it is gone from Europe is \u201cgood riddance\u201d in his eyes. As a bonus, the populations of Belarus, Ukraine and the Baltic States is declining. Although he would not like seeing Polish and Russian immigrants in Germany, ethnic Germans leaving the former Soviet Union would reinforce his belief that Germans can not and should not live under Slavic rule. The Schengen Area. People acting as if continental Europe was one big country. Hitler would view this as a success. Palestinian violence against Israel. Hitler did not like Jews or the idea of a Jewish state, and groups like Hamas and Hezbollah would have his support. He would also view America as a country with too much power and influence in the world. The September 11 attacks would reinforce this view. The grandson of a German immigrant in the White House. Hitler would consider Trump\u2019s policies mild, and expect the American people to embrace them. Things he disliked: Good relations between Germany and a Jewish state (Israel). Hitler would be enraged to know that people survived the Holocaust and their children and grandchildren are living in this Jewish state. The civil war in Syria. To Hitler, an enemy of a Jewish state should be a friend of Germany. Hitler would be appalled that Syrians are killing each other instead of Jews. Animal cruelty. Hitler would be saddened to know that people in the world still eat dogs (his favorite animal) and animals are being beaten and starved by their owners. Tobacco use. Hitler would be displeased that people in Germany are still dying of smoking-related illnesses even after he told people to stop. Films like Schindler\u2019s List, Enemy at the Gates and Saving Private Ryan. Hitler would not like that the American film industry is portraying him and his army. Overall, he would be displeased. Things like the collapse of communism, a common European currency and the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union were expected by him. However, the fact that Russians, Ukrainians and Jews still exist would be a painful reminder of his failure to dominate the world. ",
