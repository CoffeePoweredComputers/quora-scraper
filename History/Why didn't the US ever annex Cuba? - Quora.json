            "answer_text": "The United States eventually came to the aid of Cuba, which sought for secession from Spain, for a number of reasons, including the sinking of the \"Maine\" battleship and the harsh treatment Cuban secessionist rebels had begun to endure. Rounded up and quarantined, these Cubans who sought freedom were often silenced, mistreated and starved. Growing American sentiment against Spain in favor of secession eventually led to our intervention. Teddy Roosevelt and his rough riders are probably the best-known element of this war. Roosevelt's heroism played no small part in securing his popularity as president a few years later. Annexation at the end of the war was certainly considered, and urged by many. The hypocritical nature of such an action was evident though. We would be taking over a country that had sought independence, ousting one overlord only to implant another. Had we foreseen the future Cuban missile crisis and years of cold relations, annexation would probably have been guaranteed. After the Treaty Of Paris, the U.S. did end up with Guam and Puerto Rico, as well as the Philippines (which was eventually relinquished). The Philippines became independent in 1946.

            "answer_text": "Why? No matter what people tell you, always go after the money trail. The reason why the US did not annex Cuba was because people with money did not want to. Henry Teller, senator from Colorado, lobbied to pass the Teller Amendment which explicitly stated that the US, and President McKinley should not  annex Cuba under any circumstances.  Why did Senator Teller lobby so strongly for this amendment to be passed?  Because Senator Teller along with others had huge interests in sugar plantations in what it is nowadays known as Hawaii. Which in turn would have allowed Cuban Plantations to compete very easily with the small Sugar producers in the mainland and Hawaii. Remember, back in those days sugar played the same role oil plays today. ",
