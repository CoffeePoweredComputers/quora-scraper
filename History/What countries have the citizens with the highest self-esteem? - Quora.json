            "answer_text": "I Love this question!! I can only answer it in the context of my personal experiences: relationships. But wouldn\u2019t this be a great poll? Hey Quora, FB has polls, and this would be a fun addition to our Q & A\u2019s. I can give you attributes that jump out at me about the men around the world. I think I will adlib from my experience/perception. I will label various traits because they all lead to \u2018confidence.\u2019 Israeli: Cocky, confident, focused Arabs: Brave, committed, bold Mexican: Lovers\u2026Just ask any Latin man, they are convinced that they are the best lovers! French: suave, confident that they live in the most advanced culture on the planet. Italians: don\u2019t get me started\u2026 just look at their history. Americans: confident in business, country-proud, their culture is the only one that matters however when it comes to travel and language, it\u2019s time for the average American to visit the rest of the world. Indian: watch out for them: they don\u2019t need to be cocky their actions speak louder than any other cultures\u2019 words. They have family values, intelligence, huge hearts, and respect for women (generalizing, I know) and most important, persistence\u2026 As far as confidence, look around you, the Indian man can trace his heritage through the centuries, and he/she are quietly taking over the top jobs in medicine and IT all over the world. I would vote them as not only the most intellectual culture but the most confident. They lead by their actions. ",
