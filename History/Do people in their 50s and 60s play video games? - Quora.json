            "answer_text": "Full disclosure, I\u2019m only 48 and something catastrophic may happen in the next two years that will make me stop playing video games. Yes they do, and the games they play are as wide and varied as anyone else; probably more so. See, I grew up when games were just games. It didn\u2019t matter if what game you were playing, because we were jazzed about games in general. As time has gone on and gaming has become popular, the general public has sequestered games into neat cubicles so that they can feel superior about their preferences. That isn\u2019t really the way it started out. No one was talking down to people who didn\u2019t like the games that other people played, because they were all in the same general pool. That\u2019s why my tastes in games covers nearly every genre and I have no interest in competition. We played games to play them, getting a high score was just a bonus, the joy was in the game play. There are so few games you can say that about these days because that love of the game has been stripped away by corporate greed and the idiocy that comes from a huge industry with no oversight and no accountability (that is changing now on a legal level and if you discover that your favorite games become illegal in your country, that\u2019s what happens when there is a huge industry with no oversight or accountability). As of right now I have installed on my computer\u2026Dex, Rime, No Man\u2019s Sky, Psychonauts, 7 Days to Die, Broforce, The Guild of Dungeoneering, Diluvion, Abzu, Cognition, Borderlands (1, 2, Pre-Sequel and GOTY Enhanced Edition), Diablo II, Warcraft III, Grim Dawn, Hard Reset, Shadow Warrior (the Flying Wild Hog games), Gauntlet: Slayer Edition, Headlander, Into The Breach, Jotun, Transiter, Skyrim (both old-rim and SSE, some \u201cmust have mods\u201d don\u2019t translate over), Septera Core: Legacy of the Creator and Stardew Valley. I also own a PS3, PS2, XBOX, Gamecube, a PS Vita, a PSP, an N-Gage. A nintendo DS, 3DS, Gameboy Advance and Gameboy Color are all on my list, as are about 1300 games. The only reason I don\u2019t have the current generation of consoles is because I haven\u2019t seen anything that\u2019s exclusive to a console that I was willing to fork out the money for. PS: I\u2019m really looking forward to Cyberpunk 2077 and Psychonauts 2. PPS: No, I don\u2019t really care for the current state of gaming or the publishers involved. I don\u2019t think they have done anything but made games more popular while simultaneously making them more expensive and generic. PPPS: I don\u2019t like most people either. PPPPS: Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Ill be 70 next month. I played a version of Dungeons and Dragons, tank war, and flight simulator on the Plato computer terminals at the University of Illinois starting in 1972. I could not afford an Atari or TI computer when they first came out. I owned a Pong game, and traded it in on a Commodore Vic20. I replaced it with a Commodore 64. We would type in games from Compute\u2019s Gazette each month, as well as using some purchased games on cassette tapes and later on floppies. I enjoyed Frogger and Miner 49er. The tunes are still earworms.I enjoyed Wolfenstein, a WW2 shooter which somehow ran on the Commodore. That was replaced with a series of PCs. I liked simulation games, such as Flight Simulator, railroad simulators, and simulation of WW2 submarine warfare. I found Sim City interesting. My child bought a couple of games in the 1990s such as Nintendo. I could not get into games such as Mario, with all the jumping around and hand eye coordination. I found some PC games of the 1990s and after to be disappointing, such as Leisure Suit Larry, where the only way to \u201cwin\u201d was to buy a clue book, which told you to turn over a certain rock you would not notice, next to a path, to get a key you would need much farther alone in the game. I have seen something like that in a current military simulation, where you have a series of skirmishes with enemy troops in WW2, then get to a courtyard where you are outnumbered, overpowered and doomed. I expect there is something like the cluebook that tells you there is a weapon or secret passage you would never find. The PC games might have a linear script, such that you go to a club to meet someone, but if you return to it later, it is empty. They are nit rich worlds, where you can do as you please. I am not interested in multiplayer games, because I would have zero in common with the kids playing them, and in the multiplayer games of 1972 on the Plato system, you could not practice landing your F15 because someone would shoot you down. I would enjoy a one player detective or adventure game, a military, aviation, submarine, naval or space war simulation which did not require you to buy extra cost weapons or armor, and which did not have the required extra cost clue books. The Sims type of game is interesting as it relates to my interest in the question of whether our reality is itself simulated. I\u2019m not that familiar with the advantages of today\u2019s dedicated game machines, such as PlayStation and Xbox. My grown offspring gets a lot of enjoyment out of a Switch, and plays some version of Mario. I find Red Redemption 2 interesting, since it allows pretty free play unlike the linear script of some older games. I might buy an Xbox. ",

            "answer_text": "At 53 years old, I\u2019ve been playing video games since the 70\u2019s - pinball and other mechanically-based games before that. BUT, my father had me beat - he\u2019d played pinball since the 50\u2019s! When we got our first home video game (Magnavox Odyssey 2), in 1978, he played it as much as I did. But one night, I found a trick in one of the games we had, (Take the Money and Run). You could paralyze the other player when you realized that bumping you and your opponent into a maze wall reversed your controls. My father didn\u2019t figure it out and was furious. He accused me of cheating on the stupid game, and never played that console again. It turned him off of video games, seemingly forever\u2026 Many years later, work demanded that my father obtain a PC. This would\u2019ve been in 1993ish. He asked for my help, but was explicit: \u2018I don\u2019t want none of those silly-ass games!\u2019 Yes, he still held a grudge. I managed to get his a cheap, but capable enough PC, and then (as things still mostly ran in DOS), I created a menu system that let him use numbered shortcuts to select his software. As I recall, the visible menu numbers ran from 1\u20139. I created an invisible \u20180\u2019 option and filled it with the kind of games my military and history buff father would have enjoyed if he\u2019d give them a chance. And waited\u2026 About 9 months later or so, I got a frantic call from my mother who demanded what I had done. I\u2019d totally forgotten about the games menu! Here, my father had discovered the Gettysburg Civil War and Civilization games I\u2019d loaded up for him. He\u2019d taken two days off of work, saying he was sick, and mom said he\u2019d hardly come out of the room! :) My dad justified it by telling me later that those games weren\u2019t anything like those silly-ass arcade games I played. Well\u2026 Of course! I\u2019d been trying to tell him that for a long, LONG time. But he still fumed at the memory of our last real game together. In the end, he was addicted and as time went on, he\u2019d come to me for more and more updates to his machine. Better graphics, faster processors, more memory, etc. It was hilarious and exciting to him and I was truly happy he\u2019d discovered that menu. Later when the grand-kids came along, he started playing strategy games over the Internet with them, teaching them along the way. My mother told me that dad had played Civilization IV until the day he died (cancer, in 2015). He was 71 years old. As for myself, at 53, I\u2019m a little old to be playing the arcade or reflexive games the young flock to. I love The Long Dark, Elite Dangerous, and the Half Life Series (looking forward to getting VR and Half Life: Alyx next year!) One more note: You have to understand why people of my father\u2019s generation were so resistant to arcade gaming. It was well known that many arcades and gaming companies were controlled, or associated with the mob. The mob enjoyed the fact that auditing machine like these was almost impossible and there was a LOT of money to be made. As a player, I saw NONE of this, but I have since read a lot about it. Attitudes changed a lot in the 80\u2019s when games became more capable, and when computer/console gaming evolved away from arcades to the home. My father\u2019s generation was still wary of the influences arcades might have on their kids. ",

I have been playing video games for over three decades, since I first played Oregon Trail in elementary school. The first video game system I had was the original NES. Then I had a PC at home, and have been playing PC games ever since the days when they came on floppies. (I loved the bin of $5 games at Electronics Boutique.) I programmed and ran a MUD (text-based online game) before most people had any idea games could have multiple players. So I know a thing or two about them. I still play video games. I still like video games. I will be buying Kerbal Space Program 2 the day it comes out. Unless something catastrophic happens to me such that I literally cannot play them, I will absolutely still be playing them in my 50s, my 60s, and until the day they pull the keyboard from my cold, dead hands. And I am far from the only person I know for whom that is true. ",

Me, I'm a very immature 51 year old man, although my wife often says I'm worse than the kids. I'm banned from shopping with my wife as I get bored quickly and cause mischief. My jokes are on par with any dad and I'm an avid gamer since Pong came out. I remember playing the Hobbit on our first PC and it would take an eternity for a picture to show up pixel by pixel. It was basically a RPG which you moved by compass directions and had commands such as take, unlock and such. Games just couldn't get any better. Fortunately games did get better, much better and so did the technology to play them with better graphics. And of course the internet. No instant access back in my day, oh no no. We got dial up first 33.6Kb/s now that was painful not to mention in the UK BT charged 1p a minute. Now that may not seem like a lit but when I used to play the original MechWarrior online it soon added up. Did I mention I was 51? I also have an Oculus Rift S VR headset which is awesome. And I cant wait for Half Life: Alyx to come out.  This is my current self build and I'm about to start modding an old case into a steampunk style with lots of copper and brass tubes etc. So next time you see a grumpy old fart like me out and about, though that could be a while away, try and imagine what games they might play? Stay safe everyone. ",

Then came the early consoles that plugged into your TV - like pong, alien invaders etc. I skipped the whole handheld era, never got interested in that. Then came games on a PC. I worked on sound card device drivers for Windows - that supported 3D sound that games used. That eventually led to me joining a games company. So I worked on games for a brief four years. I still play them but never really got into gamepads. I prefer to use a keyboard and mouse. Even then, I\u2019m left handed so I prefer games that let me use the arrow keys to move around. I tend to prefer Visual Novels, or exploration type games. Combat games, not so much, though Unreal Tournament was a fun one when I worked at the audio company. A group of us would play at lunchtime. I\u2019m taking part in game jams too so I\u2019ve not stopped working on games in my spare time. ",

He\u2019s a member of one of the top 5 raiding guilds on the server. I started playing WoW two weeks after release. When I\u2019m not playing WoW, I play Skyrim, Fallout 4, and several real-time strategy games. I\u2019d say about half the regular raiders in the guild are in their 40s or above. Yes, people in their 50s and 60s play video games. ",

Gaming is at this point quite the old medium , the first videogames came out in the 60\u2019s so that\u2019s nearly 60 years of gaming history you can absolutely bet that there are some 50- 60 year old gamers out there or even as Shirley shows Gamers who are even older than that . She asks a great question , what does enjoying gaming have to do with youth ? We don\u2019t ask if older people enjoy movies or music and yet when it comes to videogames there is supposed to be a barrier of appreciation . There are definitely 50 + year old gamers I have a few anecdotes but I think Shirley is perfect example of Gaming being an ageless medium that all can enjoy.

Many people (like my dad) who loved those games back then still enjoy video games today, which in my opinion, is exactly how it should be: As long as it doesn't hurt anyone, you shouldn't stop doing the things you love, no matter how old you are.

The people in their 50s and 60s who are still playing video games now will probably be the first generation to be gaming on their (natural) death beds. I'm sure there have already been some 90-year-olds smashing noobs in Battlefield, but they are very much the exception and not the rule. That's the great thing about games; you can still play them even when sports are no longer an option due to your age. ",
