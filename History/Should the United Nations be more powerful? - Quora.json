            "answer_text": "My question would be, for what purpose?If you're advocating for more power, you'll need a good explanation as to what you need that power for and how you're going to use that power. I completely agree with the technical points raised in Demetrius Hicks's excellent answer. But I'll also look at this question from a different angle. What reasons would you give for wanting anymore power? How would you guaranty this power won't be abused? ",

            "answer_text": "What country would be willing to \"surrender\" a portion of their sovereignty to the UN? Will the US, Russia, UK, France, and China (otherwise known as the UN Security Council) be willing to give up any portion of their sovereignty to the UN for the sake of a peaceful world? I don't think France (just a random example) would be willing to allow the UN to take control one of their companies just because it's polluting some lake in continental Africa. Will the US allow the ICC to come in and arrest our President because he may have authorized a mission against a state that is illegal? Hell no. Will the UN take Russia's nuclear weapons? Once more, hell no.  Without a doubt, many of us well-versed in international relations have debated and ultimately agreed on certain agrees of the UN that need to be strengthened such as: Building a better peacekeeping forceReinventing the UNSC veto mechanismsRevamping the WFP, and administering better aid to the developing worldBut no country is willing to surrender a portion of their sovereignty to the UN to allow criminal prosecution of officials, or being able to authorize UN missions to fight North Korea in a unified fashion.
