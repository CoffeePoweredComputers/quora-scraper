Saudi Arabia, birthplace of Islam and the Islamic empires. Israel, birthplace of Jesus Christ and Christianity. Egypt, first civilization of Africa.

Peru, birthplace of Inca. Mali, part of the Mali, Songhai, and Ghana Empires. My 4 personal favorites are China/Taiwan, Japan, Koreas, and Vietnam, due to my interest in the Sinosphere. ",

            "answer_text": "All the cradles of civilization: Indus Valley Civilization (India) Yellow River (China) Mesopotamia (Iraq) Egypt Mexico Guatamala Peru Chile. Turkey ends up having monumental architecture thousands of years older than any of the above countries, as well as Neolithic villages. European cultures such as the UK and France also have megalithic architecture. As does Cyprus. Spain and France have spectacular paleolithic cave paintings. If you want your mind blown, check out the Golden hats of Germany. Find out about the Lake Villages of Switzerland. The Stone spheres of Costa Rica, the statues of Easter Island, the Minoan palaces of Crete, the fascinating and beautiful Lady of Elche from Tartessos in Spain. I suppose I\u2019m saying that there is a depth of prehistory just about everywhere that people have lived. For example, there\u2019s a pub near the Fraser River here in Vancouver called Luminere Plaza, which used to be the Fraser Arms Pub. The land it sits on is part of the Marpole Midden: a place where people came each year to get and consume food. They came for about ten thousand years. ",
