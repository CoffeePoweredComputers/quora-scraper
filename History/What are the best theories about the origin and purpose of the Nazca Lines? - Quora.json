            "answer_text": "What are the best theories about the origin and purpose of the Nazca Lines? The explanations arrived at by examining them and interviewing the indigenous people of the area, explained that the drawings were used to tribute to their gods\u2026 and the lines were paths that were walked on during the ceremonies. Pottery with sacrificial offerings was broken along the path as they walked. Pottery shards with residues that matched this description were found along the lines. So, it seems to be the most solid of the explanations. :D ",

            "answer_text": "The Nazca Lines are a very curious ancient artifact. They can only be best viewed from high in the air but created at a time when being able to fly, by earthlings at least, was not possible. Another interesting thing that exists in Peru is Lake Titicaca. The lake is in the shape of a Puma or Leopard, but it can only be seen that way from high in the air. \u201cTiti\u201d means puma or leopard. This is supposed to be the birth place of the Incas as well. ",
