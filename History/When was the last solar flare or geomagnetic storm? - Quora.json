            "answer_text": " *Richard Christopher Carrington (26 May 1826 \u2013 27 November 1875) was an English amateur astronomer whose 1859 astronomical observations demonstrated the existence of solar flares as well as suggesting their electrical influence upon the Earth and its aurorae and whose 1863 records of sunspot observations revealed the differential rotation of the Sun. He observed a flare for the first time on 1 September 1859 projecting the image produced by an optical telescope, without filters. It was an extraordinarily intense white light flare.Also the most powerful flare ever observed.The event is named the Solar storm of 1859, or the \"Carrington event\". The flare was visible to a naked-eye (in white light), and produced stunningauroras down to tropical latitudes such as Cuba or Hawaii, and set telegraphsystems on fire.The flare left a trace in Greenland ice in the form ofnitrates and beryllium-10, which allow its strength to be measured today. (New Scientist, 2005)reconstructed the effects of this flare and compared with other events of the last 150 years. In their words: While the 1859 event hasclose rivals or superiors in each of the above categories of space weather activity, it is the only documented event Solar flare of the last ~150 years that appears at or near the top of all of the lists.*During World War II, on 25 and 26 February 1942, British radar operators observed radiation which was interpreted as solar emission. Their discovery did not go public until the end of the conflict. *In 1943 Grote Reber was the first to report radioastronomical observations of the Sun at 160 MHz. The fast development of Radioastronomy revealed new peculiarities of the solar activity like storms and bursts related to theflares. *In modern times, the largest solar flare measured with instruments occurred onNovember 4, 2003. This event saturated the GOES detectors, andbecause of this its classification is only approximate.*Today ground-based radiotelescopes observe the Sun from ~100 MHz up to 400 GHz.Space Telescopes. Since the beginning of Space exploration, telescopes have been sent to space, where they work atwavelengths below UV, which are completely absorbed by the atmosphere, and where flares may be very bright.
