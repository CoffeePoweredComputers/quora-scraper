            "answer_text": "Prologue: To trace its origin, we have to travel back to the history. According to an authentic version of Muhiyals, published in1911 CE, about 1,400 Brahmins had been living in Baghdad when the Karbala war was fought in the year 680 AD. Divergent opinions prevail in regard to the origin of the community. In retrospect, a childless Dutt personally visited Hussain lbn Ali and expressed his desire to have a progeny. In deference to his wishes, he was informed that he had no child in his fate and Datt was deeply wounded by this oracle. Hence, the Imam prayed and informed Dutt that he would have one more child. This continued till Imam gave him good news of seven children. 2. Brief facts of the history: As per Mohyal oral history, a Rahab Sidh Dutt (Mohyal of the Dutta clan) had fought on behalf of IImam Hussain in the Battle of Karbala (680 C.E.), more specifically in the storming of Kufa- sacrificing his seven sons in the process. According to legend, Rahab Sidh Dutta (also mentioned as Rahib Sidh or Sidh Viyog Datt in some versions) was the leader of a small band of career-soldiers living near Baghdad around the time of the battle of Karbala. The legend mentions the place where he stayed as Dair-al-Hindiya, meaning \"The Indian Quarter\", which matches an Al-Hindiya in existence today. The community that came alive hence, came to be known as Hussaini Brahmins. They are now spread across Sindh in Pakistan besides Arabia, Delhi, Maharashtra and Rajasthan as also other parts of India, About 125 families of Hussaini Brahmins are settled in Pune. Hussaini Brahmin is a Mohyal community with links to Hinduism only The Mohyal community is Hindu by identity, however, as consistent with the Hindu tradition, they have adopted non-Indic traditions. Hussaini Brahmins are mostly located in Punjab and are also known as Dutts or Mohiyals. They are the true examples who fought for Imam Hussain. It is believed that an ancestor named Rahab travelled from Punjab to Arab and there developed close relations with Imam Hussain. In the battle of Karbala, Rahab fought with Imam against Yazid. Not only this, his sons also joined him and most of them were killed in the battle. After seeing the sacrifice and love of Rahab's, Imam bestowed upon him the title of King or Sultan and told him to go back to India. It is because of this close bond between the ancestors of Rahab and Imam Hussain, they got the name as Hussaini Brahmins. In Ajmer (Rajasthan), a place of Sufi pilgrimage where Kwaja Moinuddin Sisti lived, there exists even to-day a sect of people who call themselves a Hussaini Brahmins, who are neither orthodox Hindus nor non-orthodox Muslims.. Hussaini Brahmins practise a mixed blend of orthodox Vedic and Islamic traditions. A saying in Hindi/Urdu language refers to the Hussaini Brahmans thus: \"Wah Datt Sultan, Hindu ka dharm, Musalman ka Iman, Adha Hindu adha Musalman (Well Datt Sultan, declaring Hindu Dharma and following Muslim practice, Half Hindu and Half Muslman [Shia]). Hussaini Brahmins used to live in Lahore until 1947 when they were forced to leave. Please have a glimpse of the Hussaini Brahmins below:-   There are divergent opinions regarding the origins of the community. A few families are settled in Delhi also and they observe Muharram every year. 3. What is about battle of Karbala? The fierce battle of Karbala took place on the 10th day of Muharram also known as Ashura. The battle was fought in 680 CE between Yazid, a tyrant who had usurped the Muslim caliphate and Imam Hussain, grandson of the Prophet Muhammad through his daughter Fatima and her husband Imam Ali. As this war took place in the month of Muharram so, it is observed with great solemnity in several parts of the Muslim world. While the Imam Hussain's army consisted of his friends, relatives, family including women and young children, the Yazid army comprised thousands of soldiers. They arrested Hussain and his group and did not provide water and food for successive three days in the desert heat. After that, the soldier\u2019s cruelly killed Hussain and his 6-year old son and took the women with them as captives. Muslims observe mourning in honour of the sacrifice of the innocent lives in the month of Muharram. {Note:-The Battle of Karbala was fought on the 10th day of October, 680 between the army of the second Umyyad Caliph Yazid I and a small army led by Hsayn ibn Ali, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad at Karbala, Iraq]  Abbas Al-Musavi's Battle of Karbala, Brooklyn Museum 4. Aftermath of the war: The survivors in the battle of Karbala reached India and settled in the western Punjab. This Hussaini Barhmin sect practised an intriguing blend of Islamic and Hindu practices that is why they are also known as 'half Hindu' and 'half Muslim'. There is a popular saying about the Hussainis: Wah Dutt Sultan, Hindu ka dharm Musalman ka iman, Adha Hindu adha Musalman. There is also another story how Dutts of Punjab came to be known as Hussaini Brahmins. One of the wives of Imam Hussain namely Sahhr Banu, was the sister of Chandra Lekha or Mehr Banu, the wife of an Indian king Chandragupta. When it was clear that Yazid will wage a war with the Imams, the then son of Imam named Ali Ibn Hussain dashed off a letter to Chandragupta seeking help against Yazid. Thereupon, Chandragupta soon dispatched his army to Iraq to assist the Imam. By the time they arrived, the Imam had been slain. In the town of Kufa, the present day Iraq, they met with Mukhtar Saqaffi, a disciple of the Imam, who arranged a stay for them in a special part of the town which today is known as Dair-i-Hindiya or 'the Indian quarter'. Under the leadership of Bhurya Dutt, some Dutt Brahmins together with Mukhtar Saqaffi took avenge for the death of the Imam. Some stayed in Kufa and some returned back to India. Here they built up a community and called themselves as Hussaini Brahmins. They did not convert themselves to Islam and kept alive in memory of their links with Imam Hussain. 5. Muharram: Significance The Muharram month is extremely holy month for the Muslim community. Shia's mourn the death of Imam Hussain and his family. They pay their respect and pray for them. In fact they refrain them from all joyous events. The period of mourning starts on the 1st day of Muharram and lasts for 10 days until the death of Imam Hussain. They mourn by putting black clothes, observe abstinence, fasting and they break their fast on the 10th day. On the other hand, the 10th day of Muharram also marks the day when Allah saved the Children of Israel from Pharaoh in Egypt. In 622 CE, when Prophet Muhammad met with the people of Madina, he came to know from the Jews that some people fasted on this day because Allah saved the life of Israel Children from their enemy, the Pharaoh in Egypt and as a sign of gratitude to Allah; the Prophet Musa also fasted on this day. Since then, Muhammad also wanted his followers to observe a two-day fast on the day of Ashura and the day prior. So, it is said that on Ashura, Shias mourn the death of Imam Hussain and Sunni Muslims follow Muhammad and hold fast. So, now you may have come to know about the Husayni Brahmins, how they got their name, why they fought Karbala war and significance of the Muharram. WISHING YOU ALL THE BEST! HAVE A GOOD DAY! ",
