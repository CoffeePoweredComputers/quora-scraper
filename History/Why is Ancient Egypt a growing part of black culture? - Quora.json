            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a \u201cgrowing\u201d part of black culture. Black people in the US have had a kind of adoptive connection to Ancient Egypt for quite a long time. It\u2019s a way for black people to reclaim dignity in a culture and society that has constantly found new and ever more creative ways of stripping it from them \u2014 devaluing blackness and telling black people, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways that they are lesser \u2014 for about half a millennium. It\u2019s also spitting in the face of Eurocentric propaganda which has, incredibly and despite all evidence and common sense, depicted Ancient Egypt as an all-white African civilization. (The most recent example of this is the movie Gods of Egypt.) This propagandistic de-Africanization of Egypt has gone on for a long time in the west, and yes, it is racist \u2014 the result of the Eurocentric neurosis which infects much of western society. Even if it isn\u2019t intentional, I do find it telling that so many have trouble accepting the notion that one of the oldest advanced civilizations was run by black people. The backlash amongst American blacks against the whitewashing of Egypt at times goes too far. Ancient Egypt was not what we would call a black civilization, but cosmopolitan. Some Pharaohs (e.g., Piye and his descendants) were clearly what we would today call black. This isn\u2019t even disputable. In fact, black Pharaohs ruled Egypt for a century at one point and reunited the country after it had been torn apart by war lords. There\u2019s no reason to believe that the Egyptians were obsessed with skin color (as we are), and there are plenty of reasons to believe that they weren\u2019t. However, what can be frustrating is that, while it is certainly correct to say that discrete races are a social construct, such enlightened proclamations ring a bit hollow when one only says this when it deprives black people of credit for something, as in the case of Ancient Egypt. See Mag: Racism kept black pharaohs' role unsung When writing this answer, I learned that there is apparently a PBS documentary about this, called Rise of the Black Pharaohs. ",

            "answer_text": "For starters, blame the French. In 1798, when Napoleon invaded Egypt, he went with 167 savants who were tasked with recording academic information on all things Coptic. These now-famous gentlemen initially, postulated that ancient Egypt had been prehistorically \u201cblack\u201d before the invasion of western Asians. Obviously, this hypothesis has been long since disproved, but not before being picked up and disseminated by Afrocentric academics, still persisting in some Afro-western circles regardless. Secondly, this pseudo-theory owes its longevity to the majority of its proponents in North America specifically the United States. Malcolm X, Farrakhan, Clyde Winters and co. spent quality time investigating supposed cultural ties with Nile valley populations. In tropical west Africa(sub-sahelian states), South America and the Caribbeans, and even Nicaragua; this etiology is almost unheard of. The Afro-denizens of said regions(especially Brazil, Cuba, and Uruguay) for the most part, still trace their homelands to the ancient WA kingdoms of Oyo or Kongo, practice Candomble/Santerianism/voodoo, the religion of their ancestors and speak European languages with Niger-Congo loanwords and substrata. As to why the African-Americans did not preserve their ancestral cultures, I leave that to the experts. Now, please note that there are a good number of peoples living in and around the sahelian belt in West/central Africa whose ancestors did originate in Northeastern Africa before immigrating to their current locations. These nomadic peoples, so long as they remained pagan(and even when they didn\u2019t), were also enslaved by Muslim Arabs/Tuareg to the north and Abyssinian Christians to the east. It\u2019s my considered opinion that some of these Hamites were sold into slavery and later gained ascendancy over the internal affairs of the slaves, thus allowing for transmission of their personal genealogies.  Hausa ladies (Chadic)   Kanuri women (Nilo-saharan)  Hausa lady (Chadic) See what I mean? I\u2019ll just add that the rabid criticism of Afro-centrists by the western scholarly community is massively hypocritical. The stupid, stupid \u201cHamitic theory\u201d which looked to ascribe all forms of sub-Saharan civilization to immigrants from Ethiopia and Egypt, was and still remains widely accepted in western academic circles. Moreover, it also doesn\u2019t help when the clearly caucasoid Fulani say that they originated in far western Senegal, nor is it any less bizarre when Berbers, Egyptians, Persians, Somalians, Syrians etc., claim to be Arab and invoke lineages from the companions of Muhammad himself. Everyone humours them, but most know not to take these claims seriously. What makes Afro-centrists so different? Finally, Kendrick Lamar is a lyrical genius and a thinking man\u2026he just needs to pay less attention to cousin Duckworth\u2019s sermons:-) ",
