            "answer_text": "Napoleon was influenced by Alexander in his use of small unit tactics, i.e. how his infantry, horse and artillery work together in movement and in combat. Alexander, of course, did not have gunpowder artillery, but he effectively used javelin throwers, archers and slingers, as well as catapults as his artillery. Some military historians have seen, for instance, tactic movement in Napoleon's greatest Battle of Austerlitz in 1805  against a combined Russo-Austrian force, similar to Alexander's tactics in his great victory over the Persians at Gaugamela, 331 BC. Napoleon was also greatly influenced by Hannibal the Carthaginian whose greatest victory at Cannae, 216 BC, where he defeated a superior Roman army, is considered to be the most exquisite envelopment battle of all time, the most tactically brilliant battle in history.  Like Napoleon, Hannibal was never able to win all the big battles and took his own life as the Romans moven into destroy his city of Carthage.  ",
