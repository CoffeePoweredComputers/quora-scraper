Their heyday was roughly a thousand years ago \u201cwhen knights were bold\u201d, etc. If your interest goes beyond a simple question, I\u2019d be surprised if there were not histories you could consult and, quite possibly, some novels set in that time and place, which would no doubt give a better feel for the subject. Good luck with your quest. Sorry to have taken so long to reply. (I\u2019d be interested to hear how you get on - it sounds fascinating.) ",
