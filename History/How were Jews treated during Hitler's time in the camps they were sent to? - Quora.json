The Jews (and indeed most everybody else) that found themselves in concentration camps were treated terribly, and as the war progressed and the Nazi programme changed from removal of the Jews to the destruction of them, being sent to a camp was a literal death sentence for the majority where, in places such as Auschwitz, arrivals were sent to the gas chambers immediately.
