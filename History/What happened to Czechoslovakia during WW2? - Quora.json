            "answer_text": "Czechoslovakia was split into 2 parts in 1938. Czech was German protectorate. Slovakia was nominally a free country. When Germany invaded Soviet Union, Slovakia reluctantly sent a slovak division to fight against Russia. When the tide of the war turned, Russia liberated Eastern Europe first, installing communist governments there. Only then it attacked Germany proper. There were some reprisals against German collaborators in Czechoslovakia, when it was liberated. ",
