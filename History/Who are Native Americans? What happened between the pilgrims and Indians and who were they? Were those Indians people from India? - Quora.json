            "answer_text": "When Christopher Columbus went ashore in Guanahani (Bahamas) on October 12, 1492, he thought he had arrived in India. Hence, during the first contact with American indigenous people, the colonizers called them Indians. A more romanticized theory is that Columbus was so impressed by the physical spirit and nature of the Taino people he encountered in what is now known as Puerto Rico that he proclaimed they must have been made from the body of God, or \"du corpus in Deo.\" From in Deo comes the name Indian. But the word Indian was never spoken prior to colonization. It is a name that originated from foreigners. As, it wasn\u2019t until 15 years later that the new colonizers discovered that these lands, where neither gold nor spices were plentiful, was not India, but rather another continent that they named America. The Indians of South Asia has nothing to do with American Indians. Those who landed in America were not Pilgrims but European settlers who migrated to a new land, the shores of what local tribes called \"Turtle Island\" there were thousands of communities and bands of Indigenous peoples. Some of the most well-known American Indian tribes are the Apache, the Sioux, the Cherokee, and the Cheyenne. There are also many others, such as the Blackfeet, the Arapaho, and the Navajos. Their numbers were dramatically reduced due to foreign diseases and wars as European colonizers spread throughout North America and wiped out Native Americans. The cruel genocide of the Native American people by European colonizers during the 15th and 16th centuries was so massive that it is estimated that 56 million indigenous people, or 90 percent of the population, were wiped out by violence and disease\u2014was so complete and devastating, new research shows, that it triggered a planetary cooling. The remaining tribes continued to exist, but the U.S. refused to recognize them. Today the United States unilaterally decides who (what tribes) it forms official relationships with through the process of federal recognition. There are currently approximately 566 federally recognized tribes; there are some tribes who have state recognition but no federal recognition, and at any given time there are hundreds of tribes still vying for federal recognition. They have a significant population and have played an important role in the history of the United States. ",

            "answer_text": "Native Americans are native to the Americas and lived there long before the arrival of colonists such as the \u201cPilgrims\u201d who fled Europe to seek land and escape the tyranny of the entrenched ruling classes. There is a theory that long, long, ago they came there from the Eurasian land mass crossing both by sea and by land from the East and the West. This is pure nonsense based on the arrogant assumption that humankind emerged in Africa, or Eurasia. It is extremely likely that some Polynesians (sea faring navigators related to the Japanese, and the Pacific Islanders) and Mongoloids from East Asia as well as Caucasoids from West Europe did genetically enrich the local population in trickles over time. The European settlers (aka colonists) used their superior weapons technology to eradicate them and take their land. The natives of the \u201camericas\u201d like the ancient Aryas did not believe that Land (mother Earth) could belong to humans born on earth and themselves a part of Nature, whereas the Europeans needed land for agriculture which is why they fled Europe, where the land was already owned by their betters, and believed in their christian dogma that their god created nature and gave them \u201cdominion\u201d over it for their enjoyment and pleasure. The colonists massacred the Natives, who were accustomed to taking what they needed without ambition fueled by industrial era technology and economy, and took over a very vast, resource rich unspoiled and unexploited land and made it their own. US: The animated map of how much territory the natives lost to the colonists and how quickly contained here is an eye opener: How the US stole thousands of Native American children   ",

            "answer_text": "First, American Indian are natives of America. They have nothing to do with India. Christopher Columbus while coming to India landed up in America and called these natives of America Indian. It's utter stupidity to still call them Indian. They are the real Americans. As to the so called pilgrims. They were not pilgrims. They were people from Europe, who were fleeing from the atrocities and discrimination of their clergy and aristocracy. They just killed the natives, took their land .. that's America today. Pilgrims. Are people who go to their holy land. So if these Christians were pilgrims they would have gone to Israel or Palestine.. America had nothing to do with Christianity. ",
