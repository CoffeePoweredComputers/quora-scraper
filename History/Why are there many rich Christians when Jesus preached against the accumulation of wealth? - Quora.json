            "answer_text": "Being wealthy is not in itself a sin. The idea you're referring to is in Matthew 6:19\u201321: 19 \"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, 20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. Yet there are wealthy believers in the New Testament. Luke 8:1\u20133 talks about several wealthy women who supported Jesus and his disciples out of their own means. Cornelius in Acts 10 was a God-fearing Roman centurion with servants, so he must have been pretty wealthy. Joseph of Arimathea was wealthy enough to own a tomb, which he donated for the burial of Jesus. The thing these believers have in common is that they were not only wealthy, but they gave generously. But they didn't give so much that they impoverished themselves, either. Having money is never portrayed as a bad thing. What is portrayed as bad is the attitude like the rich young ruler, who was unwilling to give his money away when God asked him to. It\u2019s not having money that's the issue. It's what we do with it. The passage above tells us not to store up for ourselves treasures on earth. But we can store up what will be useful to serve others. Having a bigger house could enable people to fulfill the Bible's repeated commands to be hospitable. Having a nice and reliable car enables us to be reliable for people who need us. Having up-to-date technology enables us to communicate with and minister to the modern world. And living in a wealthy community enables people to minister to and share Christ with the wealthy. I think God does call some people to do that. However, anyone who thinks they are such a person had better be free from the love of money (1 Timothy 6:10), and spiritually strong enough to resist the temptation to store up earthly treasures for themselves. One man, King Lemuel, asked God not to make him rich because he knew he was not (Proverbs 30:8). But I believe it was Francis Chan who once asked God to make him rich, so he could give it all away, and that's what he does. So there are wealthy Christians because it's not about having money \u2014 it's what you do with it. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know where Jesus preached against the accumulation of wealth. There is the time he spoke with the wealthy rich man (Matthew 19): \u201cI\u2019ve obeyed all these commandments,\u201d the young man replied. \u201cWhat else must I do?\u201d Jesus told him, \u201cIf you want to be perfect, go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\u201d But when the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he had many possessions. Then Jesus said to his disciples, \u201cI tell you the truth, it is very hard for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. I\u2019ll say it again\u2014it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!\u201d The disciples were astounded. \u201cThen who in the world can be saved?\u201d they asked. Jesus looked at them intently and said, \u201cHumanly speaking, it is impossible. But with God everything is possible.\u201d - Matthew 19:20-\u202c26 NLT Of what was Jesus speaking when he said \u201chumanly speaking, it is impossible\u201d? Was it entering the kingdom of God? Yes. But even more, he was speaking about the impossibility of passing a camel through the eye of a needle. This is utterly impossible, even ridiculous, in human terms. For God, it is possible (don't ask me how. I am not God!) The reason the rich man went away sad was not because he was rich, but because he loved his wealth. He was not willing to part with it for the sake of the kingdom of God. Elsewhere in the Bible, we see that God does not frown on being wealthy. Don\u2019t make your living by extortion or put your hope in stealing. And if your wealth increases, don\u2019t make it the center of your life. - Psalms 62:10 NLT This suggests that wealth may increase. Just don't make it the number one thing in your heart (that place should always be reserved for God only). Solomon asked God for wisdom instead of wealth, and God gave him not only wisdom, but also wealth (1 Kings 3). Abraham, whom is referred to as the friend of God, was very wealthy (Genesis 17). Being wealthy is not a sin. Greed, which is idolatry, is a sin. ",
