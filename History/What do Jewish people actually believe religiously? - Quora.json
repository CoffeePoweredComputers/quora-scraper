            "answer_text": "This is a complicated question, because \u201cwhat does Judaism teach?\u201d and \u201cwhat do Jewish people believe?\u201d are actually very different questions. Since one is Jewish if one is born to a Jewish mother or if one converts to Judaism in accordance with Jewish law, there are many people who are born Jewish who do not necessarily believe in or follow Judaism. Consequently, what Jewish people believe is much more difficult to answer as the Jewish people are a very diverse group that includes not just those who adhere to one denomination of Judaism or the other but also people who are unaffiliated or atheist or humanist / spiritualist etc. What Judaism teaches is much more straight-forward and easy to answer / explain (for that, I suggest reading the book \u201cJewish Literacy\u201d).
