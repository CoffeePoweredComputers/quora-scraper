            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a hard question, and as a Turk if i answer this in formal Turkish education simply no he was not an anti-islamic leader. Fundementalist islamists in Turkey mostly hate Ataturk. \u0130n reality Ataturk was a great leader, surely some of his acts can be discussed, but if you know 1900\u2019s Turkey and Ottoman situation then you can respect him as a great leader. Let\u2019s get discuss his acts and his speeches: 1- He hanged many clerics: Yes it is true, but strangely most of these clerics were simply traitors! They seeded English or Russian fear into society, and said:\u201d You can\u2019t resist against Englishes and others they are too strong, just give up this mortal combat, just pray for your life and for your honour.\u201d These words are very humiliating for Turkish history! Most of these clerics were in touch with English State and some of them were also in Mason Lobby(sad but true). Honestly some innocent clerics could have been executed, we have an idiom for this:\u201c Kurunun yan\u0131nda ya\u015f da yanar\u201d means Greens are burned with dries. 2-His speeches were Anti-\u0130slamic: He was an high officer in Ottoman Army during Trablusgarp War( Ottoman Libya- \u0130taly), \u0130n WW1 Dardanelles, Syria, Palestine etc. He saw that Muslim Brotherhood meant nothing for to save Turks. Sharif Hussain attacked Ottoman Soldiers and sided with Kuffar Brits. He thought that this ignorance comes from \u0130slam(was it?) or to wrong understanding of \u0130slam. We can see some of his speeches which is totally against Islam. Think about that, you are a commander and your soldiers go to Arabia(thousands of kms away from Anatolia) to save \u0130slamic lands from Kuffar, and you realized that these people whom you had wanted to save were sided with Kuffar and ganged you in a Hospital. What would you think? 3-He changed Alphabet, Measurements and many things into western society and left \u0130slamic society: Ataturk was a logical man, we have to admit that,1900\u2019s were the years of western victory and if you want to improve your business you have to cooperate with them. Turkey should have changed them to cooperate with them. ",

            "answer_text": "Ataturk approached every issue primarily through the lens of rationalism and realism. He hated dogmatic minds; however, he never regarded Quranic Islam as a dogmatic religion. On the contrary, his ideals and values were the reflection of true Islam. Some people say that he supposedly called the verses of the Quran as \u201crubbish of the son of Arabs\u201d. However, this is the fabrication of Karabekir. General Kazim Karabekir, who was a leading figure during the War of Independence, was substantially opposing Ataturk\u2019s revolutionary ideas and modernizm in the following years. Therefore, he wasn\u2019t granted any important office or position during the years of Ataturk\u2019s rule. He paid back by releasing his memories after Ataturk\u2019s death, where he depicts him as a godless figure and recalls many incidents, where Ataturk speaks derogatory about religion and the prophet. Nevertheless, a while after his death, they found Karabekir\u2019s diaries, which he had kept quite comprehensive. In his diaries, there\u2019s not a single suggestion about Ataturk\u2019s negative views about Islam, which Karabekir depicted elaborately in his memories. On the contrary, Ataturk was and is the personification of every value of the Quran and true Islam.Here is one of his recorded statements: \u201cOur great religion suggests that gaining wealth without hardwork is an act against humanity. Some people value contemporary modernism as the same as godlessness. Actually, godlessness is this kind of approach. People who promote this kind of interpretation want Muslims to become the slaves and prisoners of the godless. How else could we interpret this kind of attitude? Don\u2019t think that any person, who is dressed up like a cleric or imam is a servant of God. Being a true servant of God means using one\u2019s reason\". ",
