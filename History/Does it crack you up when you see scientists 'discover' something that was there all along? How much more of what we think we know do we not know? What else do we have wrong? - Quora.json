            "answer_text": "First, a quick review of the meaning of the word \u201cdiscover\u201d: From Dictionary.com - The world\u2019s favorite online dictionary! Discover To see, get knowledge of, learn of, find, or find out; gain sight or knowledge of (something previously unseen or unknown) I\u2019m sort of a \u201crock hound.\u201d I\u2019ve discovered many interesting rocks in my life. Some real, actual Indian arrow heads, several nice chunks of petrified \u201cwood\u201d, and a very, very cool fossil of part of a creature, that has perplexed me for a few years now. Here\u2019s what that looks like:  Now, I know just enough about fossils, to know that I know nothing about fossils. But I did spend some time on the web, searching in various ways, and at some point I found something like this:  and I thought .oO{Well, that seems like a pretty good bet} and based on that brilliant piece of \u201ccell phone sleuthing\u201d I decided that what I most likely had was a fragment from the outer spiral of an ammonite. One of these:  Sweet right? Well, not so fast. Upon further examination using a common cheap magnifying glass and my fifty-three year old eyes, and also having had it occur to me to flip the damn thing over !! I found this:  (Okay, yes, I added the little inset drawing, and now I\u2019ve biased you, sorry.) When I first noticed this little formation, for some reason my mind instantly thought \u201cvertebra.\u201d I guess if you watch enough science shows, some part of your brain retains\u2014something. So I went out and started looking at drawings of vertebra on the web until my eyes started to glaze over. They come in countless varieties, and they vary within a single organism also, depending on where they are located on the spine. Also, they get deformed during the MILLIONS OF YEARS they spend becoming\u2014rocks. But !!! If that is actually what this is, then no, this is not an ammonite. Can you guess why not? Exactly ! So what the hell is it? Have I actually discovered a fossilized fragment of the neck of some vertebrate animal, lying in a pile of rocks beside a stream in the Swiss Alps? I believe there\u2019s a good possibility that I have. I don\u2019t have the arrow heads handy or I would paste in a few shots of those. At least on those, which I found in my yard in Texas, I can easily say that \u201cYes, these are\u2014or were intended to turn out to be\u2014arrowheads\u201d and also that they were almost certainly made by aboriginal people who once lived, well, in my front yard, or close by anyway. I promise you though, even thought I certainly did \u201cdiscover\u201d them, I did not invent, create, or otherwise call them into existence. Most of them were literally just laying around waiting to be discovered. A few were a foot or two beneath the surface of my front yard, and I discovered them while digging trenches for sprinkler pipes. Some of the failed arrow heads were, I kid you not, lying on the ground at the storage place where I keep my boat. Every time I go there, I spend as much time staring at the rocks on the ground as I do stowing/retrieving the boat, and I always find something. In that case, the \u201crocks\u201d covering the premises have obviously been dumped and spread out to form a surface for people to drive and park boats on. I don\u2019t know where they came from originally, but I\u2019m pretty sure that it wasn\u2019t too far away from where I live either. I love the way that the definition at the top of this answer says \u201csomething previously unseen or unknown.\u201d I choose, with my \u201crocks\u201d to interpret that as though the words \u201cby me\u201d were appended to the end. Also, it\u2019s neat, with fossils and arrowheads, knowing that it is quite possible that I really am the first person to see it, ever! (fossils) or since it was discarded (arrowheads.) In case it isn\u2019t clear, when you find arrow heads \u201cin the wild\u201d, what you almost always are actually discovering is things that someone threw away because they were trying to make it into an arrow head and screwed it up. I wonder what those guys/gals would have thought if they had known how worked up some old geezer, hundreds, maybe thousands of years later would get, when he happened across their fails? Once, on an isolated beach on Oahu Hawaii, I discovered a very corroded shell casing. I\u2019d be willing to bet that it was fired from the gun mounted on a Japanese Zero, back on December 7th, 1941. I think it\u2019s plausible; and if it\u2019s true, then when I picked it up and looked at it, I was probably the first person to actually look, specifically at it, since the day that it was manufactured in Japan, (or wherever they made bullets that zero\u2019s shot while invading Pearl Harbor, probably years before the invasion. Honestly, in my experience, discovering the things that are hiding in plain sight, right in front of your nose (or toes), is a lot harder than many people realize. Hearing about it doesn\u2019t crack me up, it fires me up\u2014with enthusiasm !! P.S. If you don\u2019t think that I actually answered the question then, well . . . \u201cyer a towel . . .\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Expansionism. It\u2019s based on a mis-attribution of observed red shift. It was attributed to the Doppler effect which would mean galaxies are receding from us observers. The observed red shift is uniform in all directions which appears to mean we are at the center of that putative expansion. That\u2019s absurd, and even more absurd was the explanation of expanding membranes to try to account for that absurdity of geocentric expansion. The model of an inflating balloon was used to explain center-less expansion. However, the dots on the balloon which represent the galaxies on the expanding membranes expand along with the balloon membranes and of course no one has reported galaxies or anything else expanding, just space-time (ST) expands but not the stuff stuck to it. Absurd. 20 years ago some comparative calculations were made on the observed red shift and sticking with expansionism, attributed those numbers to accelerating expansion called inflation. Ultra absurd. There\u2019s a very simple, easy to understand alternative to uniform red shift: curvature. ST is curved. ST is never flat. There\u2019s nothing in GR, the context in which ST operates, that insists the baseline resting state of ST must be Euclidean (flat). Euclidean geometry applies to space, not ST which is Riemannian, the geometry of curvature which gave birth to GR with ST as the core concept of GR. We should refer to ST as Riemannian ST (RST) to clarify that Euclidean geometry plays no role in GR. Red shift is routinely observed in the deeper curvature of RST near massive bodies. What is being observed from distant galaxies where there are no massive bodies nearby to induce deeper curvature in RST is the red shift currently mis-attributed to Doppler effect. What about the cosmic background radiation (CBR) currently attributed to being the aftermath \u201cecho\u201d of the putative BB? Well, in a universe of RST where ST is inherently curved, starlight has eternity to circulate around and around until it degrades in frequency all the way down to microwaves and radiowaves. Here is a crude model depicting kinetic Riemannian geometry:  ",

            "answer_text": "No, it makes me think that that is science, doing its job. The whole point of science is discovery and explanation. And while discoveries are increasingly about more and more exotic things, we still have a lot to learn about stuff that is right in front of us (or inside us), so every so often we will realise that we have to view something familiar in a new light. As Isaac Asimov put it, the most exciting words in science are not \u201cEureka!\u201d but \u201cThat\u2019s funny\u2026\u201d It\u2019s when we notice something that doesn\u2019t fit with our current understanding that we learn something new - and in this case, the insight that underlies reclassifying the interstitium as previously unrecognised organ may have genuinely huge and positive ramifications. If it does turn out that that is how cancer cells spread, we may be able to devise a more effective mechanism to stop metastasis, and prevent thousands of painful deaths to cancer every year. That would be huge in terms of reducing human suffering (though it will also present new challenges to our economic and societal systems in terms of rebalancing the age profile of our populations). The great scientific revolutions have come from seeing what is already there in a different light: Newton realised from the fall of an apple that there was a universal law of how things fall towards one anotherDarwin developed the theory of evolution by natural selection from decades of painstaking observation of differences between speciesPlanck developed quantization while trying to explain why a heated black body does not emit an infinite amount of ultraviolet radiationEinstein developed his theories of relativity from the observations that the speed of light appeared to be constant and that a body in free fall would be indistinguishable in its own frame of reference from one at rest.Fleming identified penicillin from noticing that mould on an agar plate prevented bacteria from growing around it.This interstitium discovery is not on the level of the first four, but it might in time rival penicillin for its public health impact. There was nothing special about these observations, Everyone has seen things fall. The changes in speciation that Darwin saw were there for anyone with the time and patience to catalogue. The Black Body Problem and Michelson-Morley Experiement were well known puzzles for physicist. Penicillium mould was nothing new. The interstitium had been seen before - just not recognised for what it was. What was new in each case was the insight about what it meant. As to how much more we do not know, there is plenty more to be discovered, especially in fields outside the hard sciences like biology, physiology and psychology. Last year there were around 250,000 new doctorates issued worldwide (These countries have the most doctoral graduates) - and each one by definition involved original research. Some of those will have been confirming or retesting existing findings. Many of them will have edged the boundaries of established theories a little further forward. But a handful will have sown the seeds of a revolution in our knowledge. And that is a cause for excitement, rather than despair or mockery. Because that is exactly what science exists to do. ",

This means your science reporting goes: Scientist > Academic Publisher > PR Agency Writer > Newspaper Writer > Newspaper Editor > You Unfortunately, the PR agency probably don\u2019t understand the original research paper very well, and pick out a handful of key points they think will generate interest. The newspaper writer does not even read the original paper, but takes one minor point from the PR, and makes it all about that. The editor takes the article and adds an attention grabbing (nut inaccurate) headline. This means a complex scientific research project like \u2018Understanding human growth rates based on parental pre-natal diet in developed countries\u2019 ends up being a headline \u2018EAT BANANAS OR YOUR BABY WILL DIE\u2019 (I made these up, but it\u2019s pretty typical. See: Daily Mail health reporting.) Scientists work off grants and funding. To get grants, they usually have to show the research topic is at least reasonably novel, or there are gaps in current understanding. Even if the research confirms what we already believe, the very act of doing this is highly useful. Science relies on proof. TL;DR : Read the original paper. There\u2019s a lot more in there. ",
