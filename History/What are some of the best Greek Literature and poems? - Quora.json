            "answer_text": "If you are just starting out, you may want to begin with the more accessible. In my opinion: Of the poets: Sappho\u2019s poems are few and amazing. Archilochus was a soldier-poet; down to earth and amusing. Semonides of Ceos you may already have met from \u201cGo tell Sparta, passerby, that obedient to their laws here we lie.\u201d (Pindar is impenetrable.)Herodotus\u2019 Histories are my favorite. Get an edition with lots of maps and notes, or you will get lost in the geography.Aristophanes\u2019 plays are funny even after 24 centuries.Of the three (Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides) I think Euripides is the easiest to enjoy.Most everything by Plato except The Republic. Dialogue is engaging.Hesiod\u2019s Work and Days, and The Theogony.The Odyssey is easier than the Iliad.",
