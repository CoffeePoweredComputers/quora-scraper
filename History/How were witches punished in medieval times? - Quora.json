            "answer_text": "The verdict of all the court cases against witches in Flanders are on the internet, so I don't have to invent things.First of all, all court cases were civil. The church could not conduct any.Witches were not punished for being a witch as that was not a criminal offence.They were charged for the damage they did by witchcraft and this was based on complains, usually 3 and from neighbours. But the belief in witches made they were dead scared of it.Then the victim was jailed and tortured to get a confession, which was the only proof they knew.That was the end for them and they were burned.The church tried to stop this but the belief in witchcraft was so strong they could not.And one thing on the side, witches were 80 % women, 20 % men. And that was as the accusers were also women. Women accused women. That's why. Not that the society was unfriendly to women.But this dark part of our history is far more complicated then I can explain here. ",
