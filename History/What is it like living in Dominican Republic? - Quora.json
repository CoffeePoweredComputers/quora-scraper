            "answer_text": "The public services are awfully bad.The people here are really warm-nature.The beaches here a beyond gorgeous.Living costs will appear monstrously cheap if you can manage an US equivalent pay rate.Foreigners from US, Europe or Asia are revered, plenty of job opportunities if you com from one of those places.A really good private school here is the equivalent of a OK public school in the US.Don\u2019t get me started with politics and corruption,Food here is really diverse, every household has some kind of special recipe to make the simplest every day dishes. I must add this is quite amusing.You can get a rainy, sunny and stormy day in within the same day.There certainly a lot of more things, but I hope this list can get another answers going so you can get different perspectives. Have an awesome day :D ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there, For us, life in the Dominican Republic is in many ways different than in western countries. People have a very different perspective on things. For example, their ability to take life more easy-going. A pupular term of dominicans is \u201cno hay problema\u201d (means no problem) or \u201ctranquilo\u201d (calm, laid-back) which shows that they don\u2019t let themselves be stressed out easily. Family means a lot to Dominicans. They often live close to each other if not in the same apartment. That also takes great sharing skills with it. They love to dance and usually there\u2019s always music. It depends, of course, on what you are looking for. There are also plenty of foreigners living here, working in Tourism for example. In hope that we could give you an idea about how we see life here. Caribbean Greetings ",
