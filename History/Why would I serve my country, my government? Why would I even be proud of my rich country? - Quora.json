            "answer_text": "I have no clue how you grew up or even where you grew up but look around. This is the greatest country on Earth. Both of my parents were immigrants and met here in the USA, they both left their homelands and families for opportunities. My father left Communist China, he was alive before the Communist revolution and was tired of what it brought. He already dealt with the Japanese invasion that brought rape and murder. He had told me how much he loves this country and how great it is. It was not easy for him but it was worth it. My mother left the Philippines, she saw severe poverty and corruption. She too had to deal with the Japanese invasion of her country, along with the rape and murders. She even had her head shaved so she would be mistaken as a boy, so the soldiers wouldn't rape her. She was born in 1939 so she would have been around 4, that is sick. She too love the USA and all it has given her. Yes this is a rich country but not because it didn't work. The country only succeeded because the people in this country strived for success and used the freedoms to get to where they are. This country is not perfect by any means but it has made amazing strides that no other has. We take in over 1,000,000 immigrants every year, more than any other nation in the world. Everyone wants to come here to have a chance, have a chance for their children and grandchildren. So I say wake up, look around you and see the potential. When you serve your country, you serve yourself and all of us who live here. I do not pretend to know your circumstances, from the stories I have heard from younger generations though, you do not know hardships. Your expectations of America is only for white men and everyone gets the scraps is a lens brought on by the next wave of Socialism. Success is here but it's only a seed, just like any other crop to be yeilded it has to be nurtured and in time it will prosper. ",

            "answer_text": "Because there is worse countries, your country isn't perfect but there are things to be proud of, if it's music, films, theaters, traditions and if your are in America then there is the native American culture. Every country has a lot of crap historically but there are good in the countries, you just have to look. Looking for the bad is easy, but then again you have to be willing to find something to love about your country. ",
