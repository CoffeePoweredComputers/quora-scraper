            "answer_text": "In the book HD: Hieroglyphic Definitives, I talk about the \u201cinvention\u201d of Hieroglyphics.  HD Hieroglyph Definitives|Paperback Firstly, there is a difference between Hieroglyphics, proper capitalized noun, and hieroglyphics, not capitalized improper noun. That is an evolved important difference in usage of words. The capitalized term Hieroglyphics is specifically related to the picture glyphs/letters of Ancient Egypt, Ancient Nubia-Egypt to be more precise. The improper noun, hieroglyphs, relates to ANY picture glyphs from any culture considered to have elevated pictorial letter glyphs, similar to Ancient Egypt. It is much the same with Alphabet and an alphabet, Language and a laguage/dialect\u2026 The capitalized forms of the words relate speci-ally, speci-fically to certain origins and cultures ONLY. While the not capitalized are used and relate to any general comparative form of the original, Capital, Capitol (Cap = \u201cHead\u201d). Who invented the Hieroglyphics? No one knows specifically who did nor when. That information is prehistoric, \u201clost\u201d in time from 10,000+ BCE Ancient Nubians, primary founders of Ancient Egypt (Documented and confirmed by the British National Museum and others, including me \ud83e\udd17). How were they \u201cinvented\u201d is known, for a fact! I could leave you hanging and say, \u201cGo Buy the Book,\u201d but I was raised by mom and dearest educators/mentors to be an educator and sharer of information and knowledge first\u2026 A sales person, not so much\u2026 That, sales, is not even in my Astronomical Astrology Sidereal (Actual Star Time) chart. Would you like to know how? Well\u2026 F-ACTUALLY I nor anyone can tell you how the Hieroglyphics were invented, because THEY WERE NOT INVENTED. The Ancient Egypti-Nubian name for the pictorial Writings gives Cosmologic and objective clues to how they came about. The more authentic name, or one of the major labels, for the system is SESH METU NETER (Sesh Metu Neter) aka Medu Neder, Metchu Netcher, etc. The precept, founding core idea, for the name/label is that Neter, Netcher (Nature Universal) is the Creator of ALL and the primary influencer, inspiration for all aka god, God; but NOT AS IN some all power full guy or lady somewhere hanging out in the Universe, but an Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent Being (It, Nature) inside, outside and every side of ALL things all the time and outside of time as the origin of time.  We called and call IT The Great Nothing, No Thing, Zero, Cipher, No Beginning Nor End, Amenet Amenef AMEN; from where comes the origin of the term Amen (Used in Every major contemporary religion, though many don't realize it, nor why). The oldest known recorded Temple of AMEN is the Nubian Geb Ba Ra Ka (Arabic Geb El Bar Kal) Gebel Barkal To Gebel el-Haridi (Archaeology of Ancient Egypt), the Qub/Cube/Ka Ba/KaaBah, elder of the one in Arabia (KaaBah), coopted by the Arabic Quaraysh tribe ( Quraysh - Google Search) then taken by Islam, Muslim conquest. So\u2026 Netcher Amen is the inventor of the Writings, Sesh Metu. But how? It is not like the writing of the Torah, Bible, Quran or other religious book where God is supposedly the Divine inspiration behind the writing of the book! Firstly, God is not seen a person with earthly flaws and limitations as a he, she or transgender person. God is seen as a Universal inspiration in Traditional Chem (Ancient Egypti-Nubia).How do we know which book is the actually truthfully divine inspired one, as they all conflict with one another, as do their practices and followers. Is that the Master Plan of the Supreme Being to inspire war and conflict and arguments among Nations, because Eve got Adam to eat the forbidden fruit of Knowledge? That would be a very shallow plan from a supposed Supreme Being, Master of All.A Supreme Master of All influences and inspires ALL things and Beings, but that DOES NOT MEAN the Message is Properly received. Many serial killers say they were inspired by God, which is technically true as the Great No Thing that is All Things is in ALL things. But there is such thing as Illness and dis-ease, which often is the key to serial killers being serial killers. Quite simply according to Scientific Universal Law serial killers exist because serial creators of life exist. The minority of killers compared to birthers/creators is a hint at killiers having illness. Eratic, destructive, alienating, antisocial behaviors are other hints. Brings up a good question: Why do religions segregate, alienate non-members and all the major ones have their Historical origin founded in war? ANYHOW\u2026 Killers/Creators, Day/Night, Left/Right, Down/Up, Cold/Hot, Male/Female\u2026 We are able to best understand things in accordance to their \u201cComplimentary Seeming Opposites\u201d and their Neutrality, Neutral Being, Neuter, Ne[u]ter (Neter, Netcher), Nature state and function. I don't want to nor think I can live harmoniously with serial killers. It's not me\u2026 It's basically because there is a Nature in them that serially kills and I'd likely end up in the tally of the killed. Thus I disagree with the Nature inspiration they receive and would do my best to help them find balance, stay away from them, have means of protection from them, etc. Perhaps their illness is yet another Nature Universal way to bring people together in one way or another? So\u2026 The killers' reception of Divine Message is contrary to harmonious living. As harmonious living is Civil and being Civil = Civilization, then yes there is a problem with a killer's mentality being unchecked amongst others doing their best to live. So that Nature in them needs tempering one way or another; like supposed Divine Inspired religions need tempering to keep them from killing and ab-using one another in the technically correct divinely inspired nature of theirs. That polarized idea of Divine Nature Inspiration is not what is meant by Divinely Inspired Writings re Sesh Metu Netcher Amen!Sesh Metu Netcher Amen inspiration is based in Neter, Ne[u]ter, Neutrality of Nature, Amen, Neither/Ne[i]t[h]er this Nor/Ner that; but best for all, Greatest Good, Suma Bonum\u2026 What is the Greatest Good, Neutral, Natural form of writing?Should I stop here\u2026 Let you read the book? There's a whole chapter, less verbally graphic, without comparing killers and life creators. But trying to cram a book chapter into a Quora post ain't so easy, without loosing quality of comprehension relayed. Quite simply though, the best way to easily spell Mountain is:  Yes\u2026 Draw a mountain\u2026 The same style and way, and displayed along with the corresponding sounds to educate or relay a message to another. The best neutral way to spell deer is to draw a deer, sun - draw sun, fish - fish, etc.; Amen:  Amen\u2026 Ah Ha! And how did they atune, come up with the specific Sounds for the writing system? That's where the quest of questions to be further found out begins, learning the Cosmologic system linked to the Natural Divine Inspirations. Peace, Hetep.
