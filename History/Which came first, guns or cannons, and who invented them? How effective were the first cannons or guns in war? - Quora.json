            "answer_text": "In European warfare cannons were introduced first, often called bombards in early texts, these began making an appearance on the battlefield in the middle 1300's. They were introduced to Europe by the invading Ottoman Empire who had enthusiastically embraced the use of black powder and were already known as expert cannoneers, these early weapons were very heavy, very inaccurate and extremely slow to load (in some cases only a shot every six hours or so). By the time the conquistadors landed in the Americas around 1500AD guns had evolved a great deal, there were now weapons called arquibus's (is that spelled right?) which were essentially very heavy muskets, so heavy in fact that they had to be propped up on a forked stick to fire them. There were also rudimentary handguns (referred to as Handgonnes in old english) but these were too big and heavy for use as proper pistols rather they would often be used two handed from the hip (like a modern sawed off shotgun) or from horseback. The cannons of the time were also more advanced than those before being lighter, made of better metals like brass and fired through a touch hole at the breach rather than a fuze down the barrel. Also projectiles were better made reducing the gap between the barrel and ball, making it unnecessary to pack the gun with mud to seal it (the longest part of the early reloading process). Around the year 1700 flintlocks were made popular, and firearms began a quantum leap forward, propper muskets and pistols were developed as were blunderbuses (huge barreled precursors to modern shotguns) and carbines (shortend muskets for cavalry service). Rifled barrels were introduced around this time as were the first rudimentary multi shot firearms like the Puckle naval defence gun. The flintlock era only lasted about a century but the development of these arms along with England's industrial revolution brought Britain into world power. By the time Eliphalet Remington smithed his first barrel in his father's forge in upstate New York in 1816 (thus launching America's oldest firearms company) the flintlock was falling out of favor for the caplock, however the caplock didn't last long. By 1875 most caplock guns had been traded in for modern cartridge fired weapons. Historically early firearms were not very effective. They had much less range and accuracy than longbows or crossbows and in the time it took to reload a early musket a good archer could loose a dozen shafts. However weapons like the bow and the sword take years of training to become proficient with. A musket on the other hand can be learned in a week by even the most cow handed and pig headed peasant boys. They had one other advantage as well, they could pierce any armor, they made heavily armored mounted knights (who were a whole social class in medieval Europe, the warrior aristocracy) obsolete, new nations arosefrom the ability of these weapons to bridge the gap between peasantry and warrior. One of these nations was the United States as our saying goes \u201cGod didn't make all men equal, Sam Colt did.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The distinction between early \u201cguns\u201d and \u201ccannons\u201d is difficult, since early \u201cguns\u201d were simply miniature cannons small enough to be held in hand. These miniature cannons (sometimes called \u201cgonnes\u201d in archaic English) were fairly common in China by 13th century and Europe and Middle East by the 14th (Hand cannon - Wikipedia), although they seem to have been developed independently. Their effectiveness, and indeed, of early gunpowder weapons in general remained variable. (In fact, as late as early 19th century, the Duke of Wellington was thinking a few regiments of longbowmen would be a good idea to supplement musketeers\u2014and muskets then were vastly better than these medieval contraptions) In the Far East where wars were relatively uncommon and bows were superior, gonnes faded away after the Mongol era (the next great gunpowder weapon for the infantry came in form of arquebuses, introduced by the Portuguese, and widely adopted by the Japanese during the Age of Discovery.)
