            "answer_text": "It depends on your definition of \u201calmost\u201d but there were some states (and parts of states) that at least talked about it, though none came that close to seceding. New Jersey, for instance, briefly considered seceding from the Union alongside the Confederacy. Former New Jersey governor Rodham Price argued quite vociferously for joining the Confederacy on the principle of economic self-interest, noting that most of New Jersey's manufactures went to the South and reasoned that, in the event of Confederate independence, New Jersey would be cut off from those markets. Note that New Jersey was the only non-slave state to vote against Lincoln in 1860. They preceeded to reject Lincoln again in 1864, one of only three states (and the only Northern state) to do so. So god bless New Jersey, I guess. That said, New Jersey did materially fall in line with the rest of the Union after Fort Sumter and provided troops and equipment for the war effort. So when push came to shove, New Jersey stayed Union. New York City similarly discussed secession. Mayor Fernando Wood actually proposed that New York form its own city-state of Tri-Insula, comprised of Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Manhattan. Again, this had a lot to do with deep New York City ties to the Southern economy and the argument that it was more reasonable for New York to maintain its very lucrative ties to Southern cotton than anything else. The proposal was turned down but New York City remained broadly skeptical of the war. Funnily enough, a secession vote (of a sort) did actually secede in the North: the tiny hamlet of Town Line, New York\u2014in Erie County, of all places!\u2014held a non-binding resolution to secede from the Union and join the Confederacy. Five soldiers from the town joined the Confederacy. (When a ceremonial vote to rejoin the Union was held in 1946, 23 people voted against it, but were outvoted by 90 pro-Unionists!) Ultimately, however, the Town Line vote meant precisely nothing, since the town wasn't even incorporated. That said, ideas of secession were bandied about more commonly in the early eras of the Republic. The New England states, for instance, talked relatively openly about possibly seceding from the Union during the War of 1812, since they were mostly commercial states and depended on trade with Britain. Even in the lead-up to the Civil War, certain New England agitators\u2014like Wendell Phillips\u2014argued that New England secede rather than associate with a country that allowed slavery to exist.

            "answer_text": "Very good question, but I leave out the \u201cjoined the confederacy\u201d because seceding from the Union and joining the confederacy are two different topics not to be commingled - against D.C. but also unwilling to join the confederacy if not even being an unacceptable solution. As an immigrant, a good question to test American history that will result in many bad answers. There was not one state without secessionist. There was not one state were secession was not debated. The only difference was in the number and degree. It is actually sad that one never hears anything about the socio-economic conditions, the economy and political status of the North, or Northern States. It wasn\u2019t all that good. Then there were the taxes, in particularly the ones levied in the harbors. Same goes for unhappiness about the increased power by D.C., and the strong-arm politics that happened. Lincoln hardly had the popularity then as today, and the money-man\u2019s influence in the government made many unhappy. I heard about as many Brexit cannot work arguments, reasoning, opinions,\u2026 as I have heard the South would have had no chance to survive; adjusted for different times basically the same. Brexit is the highest level of rebellion against the Br\u00fcssel bureaucrats, but in all European countries there have been strong dissatisfaction and antagonism too. I end with this:Why to we never hear anything about the antebellum of the northern states of the Union?War has been the best way to preserve a union as the government now has an enemy it can use as a scapegoat, and nothing works better than the propaganda of a rebellion, even if only spoken, of anti-government is also being anti-country or union or state or whatever political entity. Best explained as in \u201cnothing will work better than labeling all who have something \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d to say are anti-patriotic. ",
