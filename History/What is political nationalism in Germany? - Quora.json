            "answer_text": "One needs to distinguish between patriotism (love of country) which is widespread in Germany. Many Germans also identify with the state or region where they live and/or were born and/or grew up. Patriotism defined in this way is peaceful and \u2018quiet\u2019. Nationalism by contrast is noisy and often aggressive. It focuses above all on a sense of \u2018national\u2019 grievance. In modern Germany nationalism is the preserve of the extreme right. For example, there is a handful of Germans who refuse to recognize the Federal Republic as the legal successor to the German Reich, and some of them refuse to pay taxes and fines. (See Reichsb\u00fcrgerbewegung - Wikipedia). A very small number have been involved in shoot-outs with the police. Some German nationalists also demand the return of territories lost in the aftermath of WWII. More extreme nationalists demand a return to the borders of Germany pre-1914, and some neo-Nazis even talk of returning to 1941 borders. \u2018Most Reichsb\u00fcrger are male, over 50 and socially disadvantaged; and many adhere to right-wing, anti-semitic and Nazi ideologies\u2019. Reichsb\u00fcrgerbewegung - Wikipedia. Note also the National Democratic Party of Germany - Wikipedia (NPD), which is regarded as extreme if not neo-Nazi. There are other, less extreme, nationalist groups and organizations, including the Alternative for Germany - Wikipedia (AfD), which focuses on hostility to immigration and is Euro-sceptic or hostile to the EU.
