            "answer_text": "Compact cassettes came to market under the aegis of Philips Electronics in 1963. Magnetic tape has been around since the twenties. The final year that cassettes represented greater than 50% of total market sales was 2002 when they were replaced by CDs as the dominant media. (Ibid.)For a couple decades, music cassettes were simply the medium for portable music and for piracy. A more salient question might be: how common were the various compositions of magnetic tape? The original magnetic material was based on gamma ferric oxide (Fe2O3).In 1968, DuPont, the inventor of chromium dioxide (CrO2) manufacturing process, began commercialization of CrO2 media.[C]oatings using magnetite (Fe3O4) such as TDK's Audua were produced in an attempt to approach or exceed the sound quality of vinyl records.Cobalt-adsorbed iron oxide (Avilyn) was introduced by TDK in 1974 and proved very successful. \"Type IV\" tapes using pure metal particles (as opposed to oxide formulations) were introduced in 1979 by 3M under the trade name Metafine. (Ibid.)The more exotic the composition of the magnetic tape, along with the intensity with which you annoyed your friends while bragging about it, led directly to the likelihood of receiving a toilet-bowl swirly for being such an annoying nerd.

            "answer_text": "Pretty common. Songs were on cassettes. Cassettes were used for recording conversations. In 1967 & 68, I recorded my interaction with my infant daughters to send to their father who was deployed with the U.S.Navy. A laugh here\u20142013 I moved to a new apartment and took everything I owned out of storage. Project took me over 5 months to sort through. One evening my mom, granddaughter and her 8 yr old came to pick me up for dinner. My 8 yr old great-granddaughter spotted a 45 record in a clear plastic container. She slid her hand down inside pulling the record up as she asked, \u201c\u201cWhat is this?!\u201d Before either my mom or I could answer, my granddaughter gave QUICK looks at my mother & me (indicating we better stay quiet); saying \u201c\u201cWe DON\u2019T have time for this!\u201d. Then said to her daughter, \u201c\u201cIt\u2019s THEIR version of a CD\u201d! ",
