            "answer_text": "Elizabeth II is a descendant of Edmund Ironside on two sides. The last Wessex dynast, Margaret Atheling, married Malcolm III of Scotland. Their descendants include John Balliol and Robert the Bruce, two rival Scottish lords who became kings of Scots successively. Robert the Bruce\u2019s daughter, Marjorie, married Walter Stewart, and their son Robert II became King of Scots. The Queen Mother was descended from Robert II\u2019s daughter, Joanna, who married John Lyon of Glamis. John Balliol\u2019s line was extinct, but his sister\u2019s line continued. Marie de Guise, James V\u2019s wife, was a descendant of John Balliol\u2019s sister. James V\u2019s daughter, Mary, became Queen of Scots, and her son, James VI, became king of England as James I. James VI\u2019s daughter, Elizabeth, married the Elector Palatine of Bavaria, and their daughter, Sophia, married the Elector of Luneberg-Brunswick, and their son George I became King of Great Britain. George I was succeeded by his male descendants until 1837, when Queen Victoria, daughter of Edward, Duke of Kent, became Queen of the United Kingdom. Both Elizabeth II and Prince Philip are Victoria\u2019s descendants. Talking about the Godwinsons, Queen Elizabeth II is descended from Godwinsons via Margaret of Denmark and Anne of Denmark, the former descended from Tostig and the latter descended from both Tostig and Harold. PS: The most senior descendant of Edmund Ironside is the Duke of Calabria, as the line of Balliols passed through the Bourbons and ultimately Bourbon-Parma and Bourbon-Two Sicilies. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s the most senior descendant of Harold Godwinson, though. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course, and many more than one Anglo-Saxon king or queen too. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve saved links or information about this, but over a number of years learning about English history I can say that I\u2019ve seen references and tidbits about her heritage; it goes back to the founder of England, Hengist, a Jute. Apparently she also shares heritage with other founders such as Cerdic of Wessex, and also the more widely known names such as Alfred the Great and others. One point that stood out that wasn\u2019t about Her Majesty specifically, but a Marquess, on travel show Globetrekker: that Marquess descends from a number of Anglo-Saxon royals, and of course, Normans, but he shares both Anglo-Saxon Harold Godwinson and Norman William the Conqueror as his ancestors. I think it\u2019s a safe enough bet that if a Marquess has that pedigree, it\u2019s not much of a stretch that Elizabeth II would as well, if not surpass it. ",

Gytha, had been sent by King Swein of Denmark before his death to marry the Russian Prince of Smolensk, Vladimir Monomakh. The marriage proved fruitful and Gytha gave Vladimir a large brood of offspring, possibly as many as eight sons and three daughters. Gytha died on 07 May 1107 before her husband had achieved the pinnacle of his power as Grand Prince of Kiev. Their eldest son was Msistislav, known to the Norse world as, Harold. This Russian Harold had a daughter, Ingibiorge. She had a son who became King Valdemar of Denmark. ",

The Empress Matilda, Granddaughter of William the Conqueror, was also great-great-great-granddaughter of \u00c6thelred the Unready, the great-great grandson of Alfred the Great. And she is a direct ancestor of Elizabeth II. Via Henry VII, Elizabeth is also a descendant of Ednyfed Fychan, seneschal to the Kingdom of Gwynedd under Llywelyn the Great. Via James I of England and VI of Scotland she is a descendant of the first King of Scotland, Kenneth MacAlpin. Not that this is as special as it seems. Because of how ancestry works, most people in Britain are probably related ultimately, by circuitous routes (and Elizabeth II's family tree is hardly tangle-free), to those same people. But it's fun to have families like hers with their family trees laid out online for us to look at. ",
