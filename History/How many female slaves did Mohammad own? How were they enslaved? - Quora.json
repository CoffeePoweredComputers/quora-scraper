He enslaved all the women and selected Rayhana for himself because she was the most beautiful. When she refused to marry him, he kept her as a concubine instead. She died shortly before Muhammad in 632. - Mariyah bint Shamoon al-Quptiya : She was one of several slaves whom the Governor of Egypt sent as a present to Muhammad. He kept her as a concubine despite the objections of his official wives, who feared her beauty. Mariyah bore Muhammad a son, Ibrahim. - Al-Jariya : She was a domestic slave belonging to Zaynab bint Jahsh, who made Muhammad a present of her. She seems to have been an \"unofficial\" concubine who did not have a regular turn on his roster. - Tukana al-Quraziya : She was a member of the defeated Qurayza tribe whom Muhammad selected as one of his personal slaves. She appears to have been another \"unofficial\" concubine without a regular turn on the roster. After Muhammad's death, she married Abbas. - Contrary to populatr opinion, Aisha bint Abi Bakr was NOT a slave.It just happened that she was 6 years old when he married her, (around May 620), but he only had sex with her around 623. She was 9. She remained Mohammad favorite wife. She was the daughter of Muhammad's best friend and head evangelist Abu Bakr. She contributed a major body of information to Islamic law and history. ",
