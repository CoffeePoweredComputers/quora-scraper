            "answer_text": "Socrates: The man who invented thinking. This might sound like an exaggeration, but there is little evidence of introspection or analysis of abstract concepts before him. Get some Platonic dialogues and read them for yourself. He's funny, and sharp and sometimes way off base, but often bang on. Wittgenstein: The man who spent most of his life putting philosophy as a discipline to death. He genuinely felt there was nothing new or interesting to be said, and all the things that look like philosophy are probably just word games. My own opinion is that he's kind of right about 95% of the time.  His work can be complicated, but the rule is to remember that he is more about destroying your stupid ideas than pushing his own theories.  This, in itself, is such a unique approach to philosophical inquiry that he deserves our attention. Nietzsche: The man who was so far ahead of his time, that people go back and read his books, and the over-riding impression is \"Yeah. I know.\" He's had such an influence over how we regard systems of social control and the \"will to power\" that it all seems axiomatic.  He took the atheistic values of the Enlightenment and funneled them into an aggressively individualistic, life-affirming, religion of the self. Why hadn't someone thought of that before? I don't know. Kant: The first person to seriously tackle the academic problem of nailing together a code of moral behaviour without reference to a god, which means he pushed the entire species forward one notch along the ladder of awesome. And that is my favourite ladder. I also like his Categorical Imperative, which is a quick test to see if what you\u2019re doing is a moral action: during a time of confusion, ask yourself, \u201cIf everyone acted in the way I\u2019m acting, would it still be a good idea?\u201d My father would call that the Great Wall of China test of moral integrity, where a feckless tourist is caught smuggling a chunk of said wall out when the Chinese customs agent asks him, \u201cNow what would happen if everyone did that?\u201d.  It doesn\u2019t work for everything (despite Kant\u2019s belief that it was universal), for instance with suicidal people, or anything where the result of a \u201cgood\u201d action would be a catastrophe (that is, the action is good regardless of what else happens afterwards), which is consistent at least, and exploded John Stuart Mill\u2019s Utilitarianism out of the water. And why not? Fuck John Stuart Mill\u2019s Utilitarianism. But ultimately, fuck Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative too.  Albert Camus: A man who understand that literature is as valid a tool of philosophical discourse as the lengthy, academic investigations so preferred by his nemesis, Jean-Paul Sartre. Students of existentialism (a label rejected by both of these men) turn to Camus more than Sartre for inspiration and education about 80/20, although they will claim otherwise.  If you read any book by Camus and then read any book by Sartre, you'll find out why. Don't get me wrong. I like Sartre. He's just unreadable compared with Camus. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a question with no definitive answer, because there doesn\u2019t seem to be any obvious way to determine who\u2019s the best philosopher. In the same way, one can\u2019t define the best novelist, or the best politician, because what people value in such people will vary according to their own opinions (to take a simple example, one person might say Barack Obama is the best current US politician while another might say Donald Trump is the best, with each quite likely believing that the other\u2019s choice is an incompetent at best and a fire-breathing monster at worst). It isn\u2019t even really possible to finely measure \u201cgreatness\u201d at the top level of \u201chard facts\u201d professions like physics or engineering, especially when looking at all of history, because all quantitative metrics become meaningless. Marie Curie won a Nobel Prize twice, which no-one else has; does that mean she was the greatest scientist of all time? What if the Nobel Prizes had existed at the time of Newton or Galileo? Another issue is that philosophers, like other thinkers, don\u2019t operate in a vacuum, contrary to the ever-popular \u201cgreat man\u201d view of history. They build on the ideas of people who came before them and draw on interactions with other people around them; Isaac Newton famously said \u201cIf I have seen farther than other men it is only because I have stood on the shoulders of giants\u201d. To take an example of a person whose name is likely to come up on any attempted list of \u201cgreat philosophers\u201d, Socrates: if one believes the stereotypical view of him, he was a radical weirdo whose views were completely different to those around him. But in fact, it\u2019s almost certainly no accident that the ideas he developed and spread emerged in ancient Athens, a time and place where there was a large urban leisured class who were actively encouraged to engage in intellectual pursuits. (Other \u201cgreat philosophers\u201d of the same era, Confucius and the Buddha, similarly appeared in wealthy, increasingly urbanized civilizations which provided an environment for generation, exchange and discussion of new ideas.) When dealing with such distant history, we tend to only hear about certain individuals who gained fame and/or notoriety, when in fact it\u2019s likely that there were many less famous people around the same time with similar ideas and/or whose input helped the \u201cgreat man\u201d develop their philosophy. Therefore, I think it\u2019s fairly pointless to talk about which individual philosopher is \u201cthe greatest\u201d and better to look at the philosophical ideas themselves and the overall environment from which they emerged.
