            "answer_text": "Most of my life, I harbored a typical American view of France. I thought the French were arrogant and ungrateful for the sacrifices made to liberate them from the Nazis\u2014you know, that was 75 years ago this year, and maybe it\u2019s time to stop expecting gratitude every moment\u2014though I have undying admiration for the armed forces of many nations who risked their lives for democracy on French soil. I was so prejudiced against the French that I consciously said to myself, \u201cI have no interest in ever going to France. Especially Paris. Those Parisians have such an attitude.\u201d But a set of circumstances (read the story on my blog: In Search of the American Dream ) put me in Paris for a one-year creative writing sabbatical a few years ago. I lived chez famille \u2013 with my landlord and her two nieces. The day I arrived at her house in Paris her son was visiting, a rare occurrence that she planned to celebrate with him. I was famished. I said so and was about to follow up that statement with the question, \u201cWhere is the nearest grocery store?\u201d when she interrupted and said, \u201cI have this steak for me and my son. Would you like it?\u201d I will never forget this incredible generosity. The whole family has proven to be fantastic friends \u2013 I just spent three weeks this summer staying with one niece while I pursued a brief writing sabbatical. More on that at In Search of the American Dream Yes, Parisians tend to be, let\u2019s call it \u201csupremely confident.\u201d But so what? They\u2019ve always answered my questions about the Metro or the bus with graciousness. I\u2019ve also met the most delightful people in the French countryside. In summary, I\u2019m now in love with France and a great admirer of the French and all the beauty they\u2019ve brought into the world through architecture, music, painting, and literature (I just finished The Hunchback of Notre Dame\u2014a thrilling tale). I hope to spend a few years living in France when I retire\u2014this time in the French countryside, with frequent visits to the beautiful historic libraries of Paris. It\u2019s on my mind daily. And I can\u2019t wait. That\u2019s how much I think of France. ",

            "answer_text": "I love the country and its people. I have always loved travelling but my love affair with France started at age 3 with my parents, on holiday. It seemed I was able to communicate with anyone despite the language barrier! At 14 I struck up a friendship with a French boy of my age who lived in Rennes. We visited each other\u2019s family homes every summer holiday until leaving school. Since then I\u2019ve travelled a lot in France, mainly on business. And now I live here (since 2013). I adore my adoptive country. The people are friendly and appreciative of me speaking their language. I love the inclusive nature of the French and the solidarity in face of traumatic incidents - where we live in the Aude we have recently had terrorist attacks, severe flooding and forest fires; the way the communities have pulled together has been inspiring. The country is varied, ranging from beautiful to savage to decayed. The infrastructure works pretty well. There is a tendency to being over-bureaucratic. The shops in general don\u2019t open on Sundays; people eat as a family; profit is not the main objective; and two hours for lunch is a marvellous concept! ",
