By c. 35k we settled Europe. By c.17k years ago we settled the Americas. But we are the 3rd wave of hominids to leave Africa. C. 2 million years aago. Homo Erectus colonized Eurasia. Unfortunately they evolved into 3 foot \u201chobbits\u201d and died out by c. 50k years ago. The second wave left c. 600k years ago. They evolved into Neanderthals and Denisovans.
