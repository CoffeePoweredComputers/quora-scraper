            "answer_text": "As a guerilla fighting force the VC acquired their weapons by a variety means. Some were left over weapons from previous conflicts. WW2 weapons were commonplace as Vietnamese were armed to resist the Japanese. When they defeated the French they captured many French weapons which again were often WW2 era weapons (often US designed.). As the North Vietnamese became more involved in supporting the insurrection in the South they funneled great quantities of Soviet Block weapons which were supplied to them from China, Russia and other Soviet Block countries. as the US stepped up its effort it began supplying the CIDG (Civilian Indeginous Defense Group) forces with Western weapons in large quantities so they could be more effective in combating the VC. Ironically Many of these weapons through corruption and coercion ended up in the hands of the VC. Some VC weapons were homemade weapons such as muskets, boobytraps, crossbows and expedient devices. When we captured VC weapons they were all over the map in terms of sophistication, country of origin and weapons types. After 1968 often times \u201cV.C.\u201d We're in fact NVA units posing as VC to maintain the illusion of a southern insurrection. At TET the VC was largely decimated in the country wide offensive which was intended to cause an insurrection in the South. Instead the ranks of the VC were close to annihilation effectively elimination any opposition by them when the North ultimately took over. As we now know, though a military disaster, TET convinced America that the war situation was far worse than the military and politicians had been sharing and that the war was unwinnable. Hence a decisive tactical loss on a massive scale became a strategic loss ultimately leading to our inevitable withdrawal. ",
