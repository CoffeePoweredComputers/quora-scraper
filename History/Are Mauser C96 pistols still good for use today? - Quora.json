            "answer_text": "I have always loved the design and history behind the C-96 Broomhandle Mauser and the \u201cBolo\u201d or Bolshevik short barreled version. I have owned a Red 9, a C-96 with shoulder stock and harness and a Bolo version in 7.62 x 25 Mauser   Several years ago the Chinese Police were able to unload their stockpile of Broomhandle Mausers onto the US gun market. At one point I\u2019ll bet I had a dozen or more in everything from NRA VG to \u201crelic\u201d condition. Every single one suffered from the same issue regardless of when they were made ( Pre-War or Post War model) was the Barrels were shot completely smooth. The Pistol was as advanced as it could be in it\u2019s day, 10 shots compared to a revolver\u2019s 6 shots, a hyper velocity round with a flat shooting bullet of approx 85 grains. The round had extreme penetration, easily passing thru men and animals with a devastating wound. The pistol is unique that it has only one screw in the whole pistol and all that is for is to hold the grips in place. The gun snap fits like a puzzle and is a marvel of design and workmanship. The pistol is loaded thru the top of the magazine with a 10 round stripper clip.  Having said all that I want to say this , if this was my only option for personal or home protection, It will get the job done. But the cheapest , used modern hand gun would offer a much more practical answer to your handgun needs. Is the Mauser C-96 Broomhandle still good for use today ? Yes, but there are much more practical weapons available . These pictures kind of put the C-96 into it\u2019s historical perspective    ",

            "answer_text": "Generally speaking, yes. Intelligently speaking? No. A million times, please, no. The last C96 was manufactured in 1937. From an \u201cit\u2019s just a gun\u201d standpoint, yeah, if it\u2019s functional, shoot it. From the \u201cit\u2019s a collectible with quite a bit of value. Please don\u2019t do that.\u201d standpoint\u2026If you break a part, there\u2019s really no cheap way to fix it and it will be essentially impossible to repair it with parts that are from the era it was made in. You put in new parts, congrats, 90% of the value of the C96 is gone. Then\u2026it is just another old gun. Read up on Federal Ordinance\u2019s M714 or any of the reproductions. Seriously, please, please read up on \u2018em. Because here\u2019s the deal; they\u2019re basically the same, only one is a piece of history with it\u2019s own peculiarities, and the other is a gun with the same visual look, and same peculiarities. But, if you want to tie a string to an M714, tie it to the back of your truck, and drag it around in a cow pasture for two hours straight, you won\u2019t be dramatically devaluing a firearm that is, by most accounts, a milsurp collectible. I myself have never even seen a C96 in person. If I ever do, it will be memorable for me and because of that it\u2019s really tough for me to think of an original being used with the frequency of a Glock. Yeah, Mauser made more than a million, not counting other makers, but still a high-quality example will fetch a pretty penny. ",

            "answer_text": "About 25 years ago , \u201cShotgun News\u201d advertised a lot of \u201cBol\u201d Mausers for sale. These had an interesting history as they were part of a lot that had been purchased for the Bolshevik Revolution, in Russia in 1917. They had been kept by the soviet government until the late 1930\u2019s and then sent to China to become ultimately police sidearms in the provinces. These were finally gathered up and sold to dealers on a \u201cpot luck\u201d basis, as is, no way to predetermine manufacturers or condition. Whoever had them also had lots of parts available, soI purchased 2 at $100.00 each. These were naturally 7.62X25 Mauser (note Mauser not Russian. The Russian is loaded too hot for these pistols. When I got my two they were German made, NRA Used Poor condition exteriors but Good Condition interiors, and thus shootable. Like all Broomhandles these were heavy, somewhat clunky by modern standards, and loaded with pinch points. I raked, scraped and finally came up with a couple of boxes of shootable cartridges made for the 7.62 Mauser by Winchester sometime before WWII. In the field they shot good, very accurate and easy to handle but dealing with them in cleaning and maintenance I had blood blisters on every finger, and several on both hands. I had planned to order dies to reload ctgs. but never did, I put them on the top shelf of one of the gun safes. As far as I know they are still there. I left them there when my second wife and I busted the blanket. My step son may have found a good use for them but I never did. I never built holsters, loaded ammunition or changed grips (both had some chunks out of the wood grips) They would have been a pain to carry and I had other revolvers and pistols available, that were better for my purposes. They would have been state of the art in the Boer War, and in the Bolshevik Revolution, but that\u2019s been a good while ago and time has allowed for the creation of better EDC\u2019s . They are fun at the firing line and you really feel the history but at least for me they are \u201csafe queens\u201d even though I could have carried them and shot them daily without hurting the collector value. The C96 or Broom handle is still a good gun even after all these years, but then there are a lot of good guns on the used market that stand up well today. ",

            "answer_text": "Well let\u2019s see. A Mauser C96 \u201cBroomhandle\u201d pistol is longer, bigger, and heavier than modern handguns, and therefore much less hip holster friendly or concealable than what we are used to now. Sometimes it is chambered in 9mm, but usually it is chambered for 7.63 x 25 (.30 cal) Mauser, a powerful but somewhat hard to find round that is almost always loaded with full metal jacketed bullets, which penetrate well but are not as dynamic on-target as expanding rounds. So there are much better choices for a pistol than the old Broomhandle Mauser. That said, the Broomhandle was a quality gun. It was very expensive in its day. It is a very accurate, tough, reliable pistol that almost never jams. To say that it is not as desireable as a modern SIG or Glock is NOT to say that you are poorly armed with one.

This not being 1896, there are now numerous simpler, lighter, less awkward , easier carrying, quicker reloading and easier to maintain sidearms available for much less money. A Springfield XDm or a Glock 34 is a superior fighting tool without a doubt. So is a modern 1911. On the other hand, if a Broomhandle was the only Gun I had available for a fight, I would not feel too badly Armed. Winston Churchill found his C96 much preferable to the saber at the Battle of Omdurman , and it kept him from being sword-hacked or speared on several occasions. Yes, you could use it today. If no Glock or XDm is readily available. ",

I certainly wouldn\u2019t feel outgunned with it, and with practice you can learn to load quickly with stripper clips; but there are far easier and more modern designs that are better suited for today\u2019s uses.

It is obsolescent compared to more modern semi auto pistols with detachable high capacity magazines, but it is perfectly serviceable, so I would call it good for use. All examples are getting pretty long in the tooth, and I\u2019m not sure that I would consider its construction to be as robust as others of its vintage such as the Colt Model 1911, so give any example a good look. It is a nice weapon. ",

That said, guns wear out, even guns made as little as 40 years ago. Older guns are more likely to break. Also, it might be hard to find ammo for the old Mauser. I think some were made in 9mm Parabellum, but the other cartridges are pretty hard to find now. For defensive use, get a new pistol. Save the antique Mauser for admiring and occasional fun shooting.

They are not practical for self defense because because they are akward to reload and they require sufficient training and experience to safely handle. Also holsters are not really available for concealed carry. The Chinese military field holster is good for open carry and carries two spare reloads. ",
