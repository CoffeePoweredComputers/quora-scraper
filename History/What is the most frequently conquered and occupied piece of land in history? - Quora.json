From earliest times, it was a buffer region between Egypt, which was the richest prize from ancient history until not that long ago, and any invader coming in from the Asian landmass.  And in the other direction, it was also the route through which Egyptian armies had to go whenever they were strong enough to expand Egyptian power.   Can't think of any century in recorded history when some hostile army wasn't tramping up or down that region. On top of the dizzying array of wars recorded during Pharaonic Egypt and the Old Testament, here are just some of the invasions that went through there off the top of my head: 500s BC, Persians gobbling it up en route to Egypt400s BC, Persians putting down rebellions in Egypt and Egyptians rebelling and setting out from Egypt to points north300s BC, Alexander the Great200s BC, various wars between Hellenic kingdoms in Egypt and Syria100s BC, see preceding1st C.
