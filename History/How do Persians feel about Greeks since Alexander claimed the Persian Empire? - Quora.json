In addition among the modern iranians almost everything about Greeks and Greek culture is regarded with enthusiasm, curiosity, appreciation and passion towards one of the ancient civilizations that has existed on the face of the earth and the current inheritors of that civilization who might despite the distance share a lot of similarities with us, including common humanistic emotions that can build a future of special friendship and love between the two nations.

            "answer_text": "Most Iranian do not consider Alexander to be Greek. He is known in Farsi as \u201cEskandar-e Maghdooni\u201d, or Alexander the Macedonian. Certainly not \u201cthe great\u201d, Iranian history is full of stories involving his defeats (as well as eventual triumph) against the Persians, but that is a common theme for Iranians with many other emperors, conquerors and nations. I can not think of a single instance of hearing anything negative about Greeks from an Iranian, other then my close buddy who was prohibited from marrying his long-term Greek girlfriend for not belonging to the Orthodox Church. He dislikes Greeks now, but that's another story. ",
