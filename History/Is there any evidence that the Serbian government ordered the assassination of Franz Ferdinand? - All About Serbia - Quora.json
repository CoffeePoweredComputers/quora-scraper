            "answer_text": "Is there any evidence that the Serbian government ordered the assassination of Franz Ferdinand? No, there\u2019s no evidence. However, I can assure you that about half of the government knew that something is going to happen. First of all, Serbian government was very wary of those manoeuvres around Sarajevo planned exactly on the St Vitus\u2019 Day which is the most holy religious Serb holiday. Later on, documents were found whereby it transpires that AHE military were preparing for something more and not just manoeuvres planned to intimidate Serbia. Furthermore, political situation in the Kingdom of Serbia was not all that bad. There was reasonably solid democracy, tenuous and fragile but still there. Country was recovering from two serious Balkan Wars. A period of rest and stabilization was desperately needed. So, nobody normal would have wished any confrontation! However, Serbs never lack in \u201cabnormals\u201d. One somesuch on world-wide scale was Lt-Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107 - Apis. Please note his nickname, Apis. That\u2019s after the famous mythical bull. And the guy looked a bit like a bull. Very tall, strong, bald, slightly overweight, crazy brave! Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107 - Wikipedia This man was also completely crazy. He was the main conspirator and executor of May putsch whereby he with his fellow officers assassinated Kind Aleksandar Obrenovi\u0107 and his wife Draga Ma\u0161in in a most atrocious manner. Her body was cut with sabres and some enterprising officer stuck his sabre in her private parts! Then they throw the mutilated bodies down to the main street in front of the court. Some hours later, the Austrian consul came over and insisted that the bodies should be removed. I believe that their remnants are in the most beautiful Belgrade church of St Marko. He claimed that he is going to kill three emperors and eliminate three empires! That\u2019s exactly what he did! Now, situation in Bosnia was bad. Many Serbs were living there and AHE simply anexed it in a good German fashion. German king wants something, he takes it! Simple! So, people were revolting, preparing for an uprising. Everything was ready for a spark to ignite the barrel with gun powder. An Serbs provided the idiot! Enters Apis! He was nothing less than chief of the Serbian military secrete intelligence organization. So, he organized the assassination of the Archduke. Bear in mind that basing on very shaky information Serbian government sent a warning to the Viennese Ball Platz (headquarters of the AHE Foreign Office) but the Austrians chose to ignore it. In that particular war out of approximately 4.5 million people Serbs lost approximately 1.2 million. Every second adult male perished. Many soldiers and civilians died of hunger, freezing, infectious disease (cholera, dysentery, typhoid, typhus, etc) and not just in military operations. Serbia never recovered from that. And to make matters worse, due to various reasons, Serbia became a focal point, a nidus, of Yugoslavia. This directly led to another disaster due to Ustasha genocide in the WW II which amounted to at least 1.6 million Yugoslavs dead and out of those at least one million Serbs. And this continued and in the Yugoslav Civil Wars of the 1990s further thousands were killed and Serbs completely eliminated from Croatia, Kosovo and significant parts of Bosnia. So, Apis really messed things up properly! Princ Regent, Aleksandar Karadjordjevi\u0107 (future king who will be assassinated in France in 1934. by an Ustasha terrorist) really didn\u2019t like Apis and his organization the Black Hand so he organized a trial in 1916. in Solun (Thessaloniki) in Greece and eliminated Apis!!!

The diplomatic books have been opened for both the Austrian and Serbian government during that period which documents the interactions between the countries. The Austrians used this as a pretext to invade Serbia even though most of its demands were met other than allowing Austrian troops on Serbian soil. (Sound familiar , think Rambouillet and the bombing of Serbia by NATO) The Black Hand or Apis was responsible for the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand. Colonel Dragutin Dimitrejevic headed the operation (He was also involved in the assassination of King Alexander Obrenovic) gathering a group of Bosnians for the operation. He was eventually caught and executed by firing squad by Prince Alexander Karadjeordevic during World War I at the Salonika front after the Serbs were forced to pull out with the combined second attack of Bulgarian, Austro-Hungarian and German Troops led by Mackenson.
