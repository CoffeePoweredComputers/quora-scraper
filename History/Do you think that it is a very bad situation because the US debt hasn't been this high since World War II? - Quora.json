            "answer_text": "Over the last 40 plus years, since Ronald Reagan peddled the Trickle Down tax cuts for the rich swindle to us, two things have happened as a result: Each implementation of tax cut legislation has required an increase in borrowing from the Federal Government to pay for the deficits created by the tax cutsEach implementation of this ruinous economic swindle, has brought resulted in recessionary conditions that have been worse by magnitudes, than the recessionary conditions of the previous economic collapse caused by tax cut policy.Our National Debt is indeed a \u201cbad situation\u201d. You rightly note the fact in the opening question, that unlike previous situations where our national debt rose significantly due to a World War, our excessive National Debt in the present, is the result of poor, indeed irrational, economic policy. We have nothing to show for our record breaking National Debt, other than an increase in the wealth of a few billionaires. And that increase has clearly come at a cost to the Working Class of our country. It\u2019s a \u201cvery bad situation\u201d because just as happened during the Reagan \u201cadministration\u201d and the GW Bush \u201cadministration\u201d, thanks to the increase in the National Debt due to Trump\u2019s tax cuts for the rich, we are now on the edge of yet another economic collapse. And, true to historical form, this coming economic collapse will be worse by magnitudes, than the recessions/depressions of the recent past, because of the sheer size of the economic malfeasance that is at the root of it.

            "answer_text": "No. Take Japan as an example (it has by far the highest debt to GDP ratio of any country), yet it remains a leading global exporter of tech and commodities. It\u2019s a producer and net exporter of basic goods like clothing and raw materials, and it\u2019s home to large, global conglomerates like Fast Retailing Co. (market cap of $50B).  The important consideration isn\u2019t what a country\u2019s debt to GDP ratio is, but whether that country will continue to be able to service its debts in the future. If a country continues to produce and maintain an environment that fosters production (keep effective tax rates low, attract corporations, make it easy for entrepreneurs to start businesses, maintain legal systems that minimize transaction costs, etc.), then a high ratio of government debt to GDP won\u2019t necessarily choke a country\u2019s economic performance.

Let's all of us have a party in the middle East that last 20 years ($$$). What a great idea, as the monster known as Communism in the far East, most notably Vietnam, whereupon, nearly 60,000 American's had died with four times that number wounded now, calls hysterically for U.S. intervention in the South China sea against China. The cost of putting on the police men's badge ($$$). I'm not all that thrilled about simply staying home so, let's put our military in 150 countries ($$$). The Russian is building this and that so, we must counter ($$$). No other president than Washington, Jackson, Grant, Roosevelt, Kennedy served in the military however, none so prestigious to be called supreme commander of all allied forces in Europe during WW2, President Dewight D. Eisenhower who would give a lengthy speech that was an up front warning, \u201cBeware the U.S. industrial war complex!\u201d Shortly there after only five years after fighting a world war American boy's would fight in Korea thus, killing 56,000 American's and wounding over 200,000. Besides the boy's lost the cost of playing world cop would be ($$$). Since Korea, the U.S. has had American's involved in war so far for 70 years and with no change on the horizon only 3 decades and the U.S. will have the great distinction of having American's at war for 100 years straight. The warning given by Eisenhower, simply ignored as millionaires become billionaires on the taxpayers tit and family's mourn the deaths of son's and daughter's with absolutely no death since WW2, fighting for our freedom!

            "answer_text": "It has the potential to be very bad because of the pandemic. Currently, the US economy, like many other economies, is limping along with output down by perhaps 10%, and no real relief in sight until maybe early summer next year, if we get a good vaccine soon. The current budget deficit is over $3T, and likewise won\u2019t improve until the economy comes back, which will take longer. Repaying those trillions of dollars will not be easy. There are only three options - raise taxes, cut expenditures, or print money and hope inflation makes the problem go away (or some combination). The real economic activity that has been lost during the pandemic is gone forever, the stock market is being sustained by quantitative easing (printing money), and will collapse when that stops, as stop it must sometime. The real eceonomic activity needed to sustain current stock valuations is simply not there. The next administration will have major problems dealing with this. ",
