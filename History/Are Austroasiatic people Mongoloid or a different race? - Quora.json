            "answer_text": "Yes, the Austroasiatic (or Mon-Khmer) people are a Mongoloid (East Asian-related) population native to Southeast Asia. They originated in southern China and Laos.  Several genetic and linguistic studies came to similar results: The origin and homeland of the early Austroasiatic peoples is located in southern China and northern Laos/Vietnam. Sidwell (2011) suggests that the likely homeland of Austroasiatic is the middle Mekong, in the area of modern Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia. Peiros (2011) show with his analysis that the homeland of Austroasiatic is somewhere near the southern Yangtze. He suggests the Sichuan Basin as likely homeland of proto-Austroasiatic before they started their expansion to Southeast Asia (and parts of India). He further suggests that the family must be as old as proto-Austronesian and proto-Sinotibetan or even older. Georg van Driem proposes that the migration of Kra\u2013Dai people from Taiwan replaced the original Austroasiatic language but the effect on the people was only minor. Local Austroasiatic speakers adopted Kra-Dai languages and partially their culture. (As example, many Thais in Thailand have high Mon ancestry.) The linguists Sagart (2011) and Bellwood (2013) support the theory of an origin of Austroasiatic along the southern Yangtze river in southern China. Early history: The Austroasiatic people started to expand from Southern China or northern Laos to many parts of Southeast Asia. They displaced the outnumberd Negrito people and fastly dominated most parts of Southeast Asia. (Later they were partially assimilated by new waves of Kra-Dai and Austronesian tribes.) Example of Austroasiatic peoples: Vietnamese (in Vietnam) Khmer (in Cambodia) Mon people (in Thailand and Myanmar) Here the average distribution of Mongoloid (East Asian related) ancestry among modern people:  Modern distribution of Austroasiatic languages:  A genetic and linguistic research in 2015 about ancient and modern people in Asia suggest an origin and homeland of Austroasiatic in today southern China or even further north and show that Austroasiatic populations also migrated into parts of India before the arrival of the Indo-Aryans. Austroasiatic people contributed also some cultural elements to modern South Asians.  Austroasiatic East Asian lineages above.  Austroasiatic speaking population of India above  The Munda mixed with the local populations and are a minority group in India. Many of them are predominantly South Asian but can have up to 70% East Asian ancestry. Conclusion: The Austroasiatic people are a Mongoloid (East Asian related) population and are closely related to other Mongoloid people. They created great cultures such as the Mon and Khmer empire and had some influence on India (Bengalis) and Sri Lanka:   Thank you for reading! :) ",

If you mean the people in China, Korea, Japan and nearby areas say \u201cEast Asian\u201d. Scientists also no longer think of \u201crace\u201d as a scientific concept; it is a socially-defined one. Groups of people lumped together by one culture might be viewed as a \u201cracial\u201d category in that culture but it doesn\u2019t mean they have a unique common origin or close relationship. The people of the Andaman Islands, e.g., have a look like they are related to West Africans, but DNA tests indicate Europeans are more closely related to West Africans than they are, i.e. looks are deceiving. People from the pre-European Australian continent and Tasmania are closely related to Torres Straight islanders and some of the people of New Guinea (but not to all since such island has received migrations Australia did not). In the 1800s when racism was the norm and cultural and physical anthropology in its infancy some scientists of the day included Australian Aborigines as a separate group, others lumped them in with East Asians; some made Malaysians a separate group; some Polynesians. DNA tests are mostly used to trace descent now. Australian Aboriginal people used to live in Asia, the extent of which is still unknown. One of their genetic signatures has been found in Amerindians in South America suggesting that inter-marriage in ancient times and migration is outside our current knowledge of historical events. ",
