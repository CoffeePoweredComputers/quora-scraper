            "answer_text": "Who has invaded the most countries in history? I am surprised the majority of the provided answers miss the point. The question specifically asked about: \"Who\", not \"Which country\", and that refuted answer like \"Great Britain\" or \u201cThe Roman Empire\u201d. For convenience's sake I would exclude tribal societies from the definition of \"country\". That leave conquerors like Alexander, Caesar, Muhammad out of the list. The winner is Adolf Hitler:- Austria- Czechoslovakia- Poland- Danzig- The Netherlands- Belgium- Luxembourg- France- Denmark- Norway- Yugoslavia- Greece- Egypt- The UK (Channel Islands)- The Soviet Union- Italy (in 1943)- Albania- Monaco- Hungary- San Marino (Please add if I miss some names) Other famous contenders are Hirohito (Showa Emperor), Genghis Khan, his grandson Kublai Khan. I also have thoughts about Ashoka or Ban Chao or Zhao Kuangyin or similar historical figures, which worth a mention, even though they are far behind the undisputed champion. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is very tough to be answered correctly. It depends what You mean by saying countries. Great Britain had the largest empire,so it technically owned and occupied most of the countries.There were hundreds of small countries (local self-governing) in India alone. The Mongols invaded much of the Asian world which had hundred if not thousand of small tribes,countries,self-governing cities and so on. In feudalism there were tons of countries in one modern country.Just look at Germany. In times of Holy Roman Empire there were approximately 300 hundred duches,free cities,kingdoms within One modern Germany.Or in China there were many different kingdoms. And some countries existence is disputed. Some considers them part of one kingdom,others argue that it is a different kingdom. So we can\u2019t say with 100% accuracy which country conquered most of states. It will be better to say which country occupied most of world\u2019s territory (by saying it in square meters,for example). In this case the top 3 will be: 1.Great Britain 2.Mongol Empire 3.Russian Empire ",
