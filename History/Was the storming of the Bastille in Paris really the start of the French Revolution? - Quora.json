            "answer_text": "It was at the time a minor incident. There were seven prisoners only, and one of them even refused to leave\u2026 On that day, the King only wrote in his private diary: I killed a deer in Versailles today.) I consider that the starting point was when the King Louis XVI, finally accepting with figures in hand that the Kingdom was bankrupt and the State\u2019s coffins were empty, applied the ancient law and summoned for the first time since 1614 the Etats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux ( National Audits) which, still by law, supposed the election of Delegates or Representatives who would present in writing their situation and their requests, at least so thy expected. The King expected something else: Raise taxes... The first meeting was on May 5, 1789. On June 17, since no progress had been made but endless discussions, the Delegates auto proclaimed themselves National Assembly with sovereign power. Since by doing that they were becoming outlaws I move that it was the first day of the French revolution. But the goal wasn\u2019t at all getting rid of a King. The general trend was a constitutional monarchy, British style, which was indeed celebrated on July 14, 1790. Things went totally wrong on June 20\u201321 1791 when the King attempted to disappear and rejoin the various kings and French aristocrats who, around Prussia, were preparing an invasion. He was captured and accused of treason. You will find easily the rest on Wikipedia. ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all. The storming of the Bastille is an epiphenomenon, whose date has been kept as a national day because the rest was not as symbolically easy to remember\u2026 The Bastille was part of an old system of fortification that the city had outgrown, it was kept by old soldiers, as a prison it was almost empty, but there was a store of gunpowder there too. The storming was when the People of Paris has risen up, taken guns at the Invalides, and needed powder for them. The real revolution took place later, when the king was brought by force to Paris by the crowd, or when the Third Estate declared itself Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, or when the privileges were abolished, or when Church offered its huge land possessions to the State\u2026 those were revolutionary moments, whereas the storming of the Bastille was a riot.
