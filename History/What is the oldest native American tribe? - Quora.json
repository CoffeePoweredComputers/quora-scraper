            "answer_text": "This question is actually incomprehensible. There have been people in North America for at least 14,000\u201316,000 years. There is not a language or culture anywhere that does not constantly change. There are people who are genetically directly related to people who were here 13,000 years ago. But that does not make them the \u201csame tribe\u201d. How one would decide on an \u201coldest tribe\u201d does not really make sense. There is constant change in all cultures. Even if we could do the impossible and decide where one tribe ends in history and another begins, we do not have records prior to 1497 for anywhere in the North American mainland. We have archeology and can see periods of change and continuity but that does not tell us what \u201ctribe\u201d they thought of themselves as and how long they lasted as a similar culture. We know for certain that people in, for example the American SW, changed the way they lived over time. For some this was by enormous amounts. Where and when one culture started and new ones began is impossible to say. The pretense that there is older nations or cultures it really just pretense. It might be helpful if we looked at an example that most English speakers can relate to. That would be the people who lived in the islands of Great Britain. All of the humans in Britain had been forced out by the ice and cold around 11,400 years ago. After 11,000 BP Mesolithic hunter gatherers began to move in. They had dark skin, blue eyes and dark curly hair. We could say they were British but very little of their genetics remain. Does that mean the British tribe is 11,000 years old? I don\u2019t think so. Those people came from a Middle Eastern migration into Europe during the Late Glacial period ~19\u201312 thousand years ago. This population came from a contracted European population refugium on the Anatolian Plateau which spread to three refugia, Franco-Cantabria, the Italian Peninsula and the East European Plain. From these three areas the lineages repopulated Europe. This is about the same time that Native people were moving into Berengia and then the Americas. Should we say the British are Middle Easternor Spanish? No really. Neolithic farmers with predominantly Anatolian ancestry (Turkey, today) for continental Neolithic farmers, but also variable admixture with local Mesolithic hunter-gatherers moved in from the Iberian peninsula. These Neolithic cultures first appear in Britain c. 6000 years ago (kBP). They almost completely replaced the previous people genetically. Culturally everything changed too. Is the British \u201ctribe\u201d 6,000 years old? Are Britains Anatolian? No, not really. About 4,400 years ago people from the Yamnaya or Beaker folk came in a wave of migrants. They brought with them new customs, new burial practices, and beautiful, distinctive bell-shaped pottery. \u201cAt least 90% of the ancestry of Britons was replaced by a group from the continent. Following the Beaker spread, there was a population in Britain that for the first time had ancestry and skin and eye pigmentation similar to the majority of Britons today.\u201d The DNA data suggests that the migrations of people from continental Europe led to an almost complete replacement of Britain's earlier inhabitants, the Neolithic communities who were responsible for huge megalithic monuments such as Stonehenge.They also probably brought Indo European languages. The DNA also shows that the Beaker people would have had generally different pigmentation that of the population they replaced, who had olive-brown skin, dark hair and brown eyes. In comparison, the Beaker folk brought genes significant reduction in skin and eye pigmentation, with lighter skin, blue eyes and blonde hair becoming more common in the population.  So, should we say that the British are 4,400 years old? I\u2019m not sure. Genetically they are. And they are hardly related to the builders of Stonehenge at all. And they did not speak anything like English. They were just like the Irish at that point. And genetically they still are. The Celtic/Anglo Saxon divide is made from newer cultural changes not long standing genetic differences. After 400 AD, people in Britain began speaking Anglo Saxon languages. But they were genetically the same people as before for them most part. Then there were Vikings and Danelaw and Norman French. So when does the \u201ctribe of the British\u201d begin? How old is it? How do we draw a line. Even the speakers of Old English spoke an incomprehensible language to English speakers today. That was less than 1000 years ago! Their lives were utterly unlike those of people living in the 1700s. So are the British a brand new people? No more than any other. It is the same with any Native American tribe. The people of the Old Copper Complex around the Great lakes spanned several thousand years and covered several thousand square miles. They produced a wide variety of copper tools beginning around 4,000 BC. The vast majority of this evidence comes from dense concentrations of Old Copper finds in eastern Wisconsin. These copper tools cover a broad range of artifact types: axes, adzes, various forms of projectile points, knives, perforators, fishhooks, and harpoons. By about 1,500 BC, artifact forms began to shift from utilitarian objects to personal ornaments, which may reflect an increase in social stratification toward the Late Archaic and Early Woodland period. They traded this copper far to the south into the lower Mississippi. These people from thousands of years ago are related to modern people. There is no sharp break, just gradual change. So how do we say how old a particular tribe is? It is impossible and sort of a question that can\u2019t be answered.    ",

            "answer_text": " What is the oldest native American tribe? The theory posits that a land bridge once connected Russia and Alaska (before people called them by those names). Supposedly, the ancestors of the Native Americans crossed it and spread slowly south and east across the continent. These hypothetical crossing occurred sometime around 16,500 years ago after they waited for who-knows-how-long for the glaciers on the American side to melt. Some 11,000 ago, the theoretical bridge was covered by the sea. Those crossers would have settled first in the land called Alaska today. Scientists call them the Norton culture and the period would have been 1,000 BC to 800 AD.  From the same time, archaeologists found pottery in excavations from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Plans and found grave goods in burial mounds from Pennsylvania to Mississippi.   The Southwest began producing beautiful baskets in the Ancestral Pueblo culture in 500\u20131BC. This tradition of basket making continues now.   Therefore, the descendants of the Norton Culture would be the oldest Native American tribes. This is all conjecture as no one truly knows what was occurring so very long ago.
