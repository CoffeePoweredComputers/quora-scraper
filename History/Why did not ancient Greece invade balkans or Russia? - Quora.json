            "answer_text": "Greece wasn't an integrated empire. Ancient Greece was composed of many, often fiercely independent, city-states with relatively small populations and geographic borders. The 3 most powerful cities of what we consider classical Greece were Athens, Sparta, and Thebes. From circa 600bc to 336bc they were variously allied and opposed to one another. In 480bc Xerxes led an invasion of Greece by the Persian empire. Athens and Sparta led a coalition of city-states to oppose Xerxes, but Thebes sided with the invaders. After the Persians were repulsed, the cities disbanded. Athens created an empire (an alliance basically ruled by Athens) for the ostensible purpose of protecting against another Persian invasion. This created a rift, and by 331bc most cities had divided into two stances: pro-Sparta or Athenian allies/subjects. The Peloponnesian War, involving almost all Greek cities from Sicily to Asia Minor in civil conflict, broke out and raged on-and-off for 27 years until Sparta, with Persian aid, emerged victorious and formed their own short-lived empire. Athens soon recovered while Sparta had overextended itself. Thebes had remained relatively aloof during the Peloponnesian War and built a strong military with innovative commanders. Utilizing new tactics, Thebes and an allied force defeated Sparta and its reluctant allies in the battle of Leuctra in 371bc. Thebes enjoyed a brief hegemony until the northern nation (rather than city-state) of Macedon emerged. Alexander the great would go on to defeat the Thebans and depopulate the city in 333bc. He'd go on to conquer/compel the rest of Greece under Macedonian hegemony. All of the above goes to illustrate that the Greek cities were never united except for brief periods of tenuous and unstable alliance. They did not have the structure or organization in place to conquer distant lands. The Athenian themselves, and mercenary coalitions, did undertake several expeditionary missions to Sicily, Egypt, and Persia. These were costly excursions and resulted in sometimes devastating failure. When the Greeks were \u201cunified\u201d under the rule of Alexander, he had different ambitions than the Balkan or Russia. He marched and defeated tribes through Thrace (modern Bulgaria) and invaded Persia. He was victorious through the lands of modern Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, and to the Indus River in India. He died on the journey back from India and the great empire he'd built fractured into a half-dozen states ruled by competing successors. Greece itself remained \u201cwhole\u201d under Macedonian rule but was occupied by succession conflicts, rebellious Greek city-states, and emerging Illyrian (Balkan) kingdoms. By this time, Rome was expanding eastward and soon conquered the Balkan and Greece. The Romans would eventually advance as far northeast as Dacia (modern Hungary and Romania) and Armenia to the edge of the Caucasus Mountains. The Greeks were at no point a cohesive political entity and went through many phases of alliance among themselves and uneasy subjugation to foreign empires. When we say the Greeks, we refer to people's who share cultural and ideological heritage, but were divided into disparate governing entities. Greece\u2019s geography made it difficult to internally integrate, they therefore lacked the physical and political resources required to conquer distant and expansive lands - though Alexander and the Romans included Greeks within their own expansions.

            "answer_text": "The Balkans to the north of the Greeks, especially once you get past the Danube, we're home to some of Europe's most ferocious tribes. Thracian and Dacian warriors were a terror on the battlefield, thanks to their use of armor-piercing weapons like the rhompaia and falx, and some of them even employed Greek armor and weapons. Sometimes the Greeks led punitive expeditions against them. Alexander the Great of Macedon famously did this soon after becoming king. For the most part, these Balkan tribes invaded and raided and had to be repelled. Over in the Ukraine and Russia, huge swathes of territory utterly unappealing to Greeks were crawling with equally dangerous and powerful steppe nomad groups, like the Scythians or Sarmatians. Classical Greek forces were not prepared to fight horse archers, and Diadochi kingdoms were too busy fighting each other. There was a Greek colony that was established in the Crimea. This Bosporan Kingdom was eventually incorporated into Pontus, before being taken by Rome when Pontus fell. ",
