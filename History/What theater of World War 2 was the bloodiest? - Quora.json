            "answer_text": "The Eastern Front, head and shoulders above the rest. For example, it is estimated that about one million civilians and combatants had died fighting in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and Syria between 2001 and 2015. This number pales in comparison to the battle of Stalingrad where an estimated 1.9 million Germans, Soviet troops and civilians died in SIX months. The battle lasted from August 1942, when the Germans first pushed into Stalingrad itself, until February 1943 with the German surrender. In that time period, the city was reduced to little more than a big rubble heap. The Germans pushed until they were a mere 200 metres (656\u2019) from the Volga River. The Soviets were hanging on by their fingernails. Somehow the Soviets held, despite the Germans occupying the high ground, air superiority over the battle field and overwhelming firepower brought to bear on the Soviets. This is the battle studied (along with the Battle of Ortona) on urban combat or military operations in urbanized terrain (MOUT). In the end, the Germans found themselves surrounded and forced to surrender. Over 90 000 Germans went into Soviet captivity and less than 6000 ever made it home after the war. The Soviets lost more soldiers at the Battle of Stalingrad than all of the Western Allies for the entire war. ",

            "answer_text": "The eastern front was definitely the bloodiest. In the Pacific theatre there was definitely a lot of horrible bloodshed and atrocity and war crime happening, but it was nowhere near the same scope as on the eastern front. On the eastern front, both sides largely disregarded the rules of war, especially the Russian Guards units and the German SS units. If you had a Guards Rifle Division facing opposite an SS Panzergrenadiere Division on the line, you know regardless of who won the engagement, there would be no prisoners taken on the other side. That in addition to the staggering casualties in the multi-millions, (vast majority on the soviet side), would make this the deadliest and bloodiest conflict maybe of all time. If it wasn\u2019t combat related death, it would be starvation or weather conditions that brought so many people to their ends. There was little regard for human life in this theatre of war. Civilians were not exempt. The last war of this type I can think of that involved such a level of hatred and total annihilation was between Rome and Carthage. The only reason it didn\u2019t result in total annihilation of one side or the other, in my opinion was because of the western allies. The Western Allies prevented Germany from being able to unleash its full strategic offensive capacity on the Soviet Union. It was like going into battle with someone holding on to your ankle. Also the Western Allies, with their counter balance to soviet power, prevented the Soviets from doing the same thing to Germany. The West limited what both sides were capable of doing to each other.

Russia lost 12 million soldiers and 10 million civilians during the fighting. 13 million Polish were killed as well (German labour camps and concentration camps) Second would be China, which killed some 4 million soldiers (on both sides) and some 7 million civilians.
