            "answer_text": "In general, the richest place in the poorest country will always look nicer than the poorest place in the richest country because all countries have slums and areas where the poorest of the poor live and areas where the richest of the people live. So even the poorest countries will have areas of \u201cupper class\u201d or prosperity. And the richest countries will have the poor areas - though in some of those countries you will find only non-citizens in these areas since the citizens are taken care of better. Second level of detail - it also a little depends on how you define \u201crichest\u201d and \u201cpoorest\u201d. You can define it by national GDP (where the US is #1), by GDP per capita (Luxembourg, Denmark, Switzerland, Ireland, Qatar, and others are above the US), and other methods. Then \u2026 how do you define poorest? By the same measure as defining richest? By the % of population living below the poverty line? Or another method? Personally I have seen some of the poorest areas in some of the wealthiest countries (by GDP/capita) such as in Dubai (UAE), across the US, Switzerland, Spain, the UK, Singapore, etc and they are all bad. And I have visited some of the 50 poorest countries (GDP/Capita) such as Uganda (and several countries in Africa), India, Vietnam, etc and stayed in nice areas. No matter how you measure it though, I think my first statement stands. Several countries that are considered the richest by GDP per Capita have large slums. And even the poorest countries have nice areas. For example, the slums of Dubai in the UAE (I have been there and seen these myself):  There are also well as slums in Qatar, Ireland, the US, and many other of the \u201crichest\u201d countries that look like this. And while I have been corrected by some that there are no \u201cslums\u201d per se in Switzerland (near the top of the list of richest countries), I do personally know someone who lived in Zurich as an expat (non-citizen) for a year and have seen pictures of where he lived. While not as bad as the picture above, it was certainly not a very livable place by many peoples standards. And at the other end of the country wealth spectrum, the even \u201cpoorest\u201d countries have nicer areas. According to the World Bank, the 3 poorest countries (based on GDP per capita) are Burundi, Central African Republic, and the Republic of Congo. All three have nice areas to live and visit. I stayed a week in Uganda a couple years ago (16th on the list) and while we saw some horrific slums, the area we stayed was nice and pleasant. Bujumbura in Burundi:  In Congo:  ",
