            "answer_text": "There are two arguable starting incidents for the French Revolution; the signing of the Tennis Court Oath and the Storming of the Bastille.   Each of these events, fortunately, have individuals who can be properly classified as those who started them. The Tennis Court Oath came about as a result of a three-way political deadlock between the monarchy on one hand, the nobility and clergy(the Second and First Estates) on another, and the commoners supported by the liberal nobility(the Third Estate) in the last place. Essentially, Louis XVI was trying to get a tax bill past the Estates General(France\u2019s legislature) that would shift much of the tax burden to the nobility and clergy in order to fix France\u2019s finances. However, the Third Estate used this to protest against the fact that they were badly disproportionately represented; despite making up 98% of France\u2019s population they were afforded one third of the influence in the Estates General. When the tax issue was brought to a deadlock, with the King unable to drum up support for his reform plan, the Third Estate split off and vowed to create a system that was fairer. When they were locked in a Tennis Court after they left, they vowed that they would never leave until a new government for France had been created. The main instigator of the Tennis Court Oath, and the later Declaration of the Rights of Man, which would serve as the basis of the initial Revolutionary government, was the Marquis de Lafayette, of American Revolution fame. Lafayette was a key instigator of the Tennis Court Oath, and he wrote the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which took influence from the works of Thomas Jefferson.  Lafayette Meanwhile, in the city of Paris, the urban poor, or the Sans-Culottes, received this news with support. They were by far the most radical sector of France\u2019s population, and saw increased democracy as a chance to enforce their own agenda, not the end-all-be-all. Since they were an urban population, they were also susceptible to the mass media; already several radical newspapers were preaching the need for Revolution, that the Queen was a lesbian pedophile, stuff like that. One of the journalists at these newspapers was the second main instigator of the French Revolution. Camille Desmoulins was a childhood friend of Maximillien Robespierre and would eventually die during the Reign of Terror after his faction of the radical Montagnards lost out. That was in the future, however. For now, Desmoulins, upon receiving news of the dismissal of the commoner, Protestant, exceedingly popular, and exceedingly corrupt finance minister Jacques Necker, delivered a speech to the Parisian crowds declaring that the King was sending troops to massacre them all, an egregious lie. This perceived need to gain weapons to defend themselves against the government spurred the urban poor to storm the Bastille prison, massacring the guards and letting free criminals along the way.  Desmoulins After the Storming of the Bastille succeeded, the armed population of Paris ended up supporting the Declaration of the Rights of Man. Louis XVI, at this point, could still have crushed the revolt with his army. However, as a result of, depending on who you ask, a refusal to hurt his people or a failure to truly grasp the threat they posed(probably a mix of both) the King accepted the Declaration as the guidelines under which France would be governed. The French Revolution had begun.  ",

            "answer_text": "Who started the French Revolution? Such a simple five-word question. Such a dizzyingly endless array of answers. Any answer depends on one's definition of \"revolution\", a term that has been defined in many ways since first appearing in English in its broad sense of \"sweeping change in government\" in the mid-15th century. Making a definition murkier are the terms \"revolt\" and \"rebellion\" which can overlap in meaning. Further, characteristics ascribed to a \"revolution\" can be absent entirely, especially in 20th century revolutions. The characteristic of a revolution being a bottom-up phenomenon, as it was in, say, the Russia's October Revolution, does not apply to Mao's cultural revolution in China. The characteristic that revolutions are accompanied by military intervention or popular violence, as it was in the American Revolution, does not apply to the bloodless revolutions which took place in Soviet-bloc countries in the wake of the fall of the Soviet Union. So let's settle on a fairly general definition of \"revolution\" given by Aristotle: \"Complete change from one constitution to another.\" On that basis, I would argue that the French Revolution was started by the deputies of the Third Estate during the Estates-General convened by Louis XVI in May 1789. Ironically, revolution was not the outcome they intended, but it was their actions that set the French Revolution in motion. If you care to know more, read on... As the 1780s began, the Kingdom of France -- the largest and wealthiest nation in Europe -- found itself in dire financial straits. One cause was the defeat of France in the Seven Years War which forced the Kingdom to hand over much of its New World possessions to Britain and Spain. Another cause was the aid given to the Americans fighting their War of Independence against Britain. French funds and naval power proved decisive in winning the war for the fledgling United States, but France gained next to nothing in return. The financial situation was also dire for France's commoners who were forced to pay exorbitant taxes, not to mention other drains on resources such as customs duties, rents to landowners to work the land and a mandatory 10% tithe to the Catholic Church. Meanwhile, the wealthy members of the nobility were exempt from paying most taxes while collecting revenues on their lands from the goods produced and from the peasants who paid various rents and fees To address France's debt and the grossly regressive system of taxation, King Louis XVI's tasked his ministers with coming up with tax reform plans. The commoners could not bear any more taxes, so any tax reform had to increase taxes on the nobility. The problem lay in the fact that any new tax plan had to be ratified by various government institutions made up of members of the nobility. Since any plan that taxed the wealthy was immediately refused by the wealthy, the King's efforts to enact desperately needed reforms were blocked at every turn. Louis XVI tried to work around these institutions by convening various bodies which the kings of France had historically availed themselves of to gain advice on different courses of action to take. These bodies, such as the Assembly of Notables, were also made up of the nobility, and so rejected any plan that included taxing the noble class. Finally, Louis XVI's minister of finance proposed convening a body known as the Estates General. First created in the early 1300's and last used in the early 1600s, the Estates General was an advisory body made up of deputies elected to represent each of France's three Estates (social classes). The First Estate included the clergy (bishops, abbots, parish priests, etc.). Although the clergy made up 2% of the population, they owned roughly 10% of the land in France. The Second Estate included the nobility. While the nobility amounted to 3% of the population, they owned some 25% of France's land. The Third Estate included the remaining 95% of the population -- peasants, subsistence farmers, small business owners, the professional classes such as lawyers and doctors, skilled and unskilled laborers living in cities, fishwives, tanners, artisans and craftsmen, etc. The Third Estate bore the brunt of the Kingdom's highly regressive and crippling taxation system. In February 1789, King Louis XVI sent out an announcement that the Estates General would be convened in the spring, along with instructions for electing the deputies to represent each of the Three Estates. Even before the Estates General began, controversy erupted over the number of deputies to represent each Estate. Although the number of deputies for each Estate was roughly equal, members of the Third Estate felt they should have more deputies than the other two Estates as they made up 95% of the population. In a seeming sign of good will, the King agreed to double the number of representatives from the Third Estate. On May 5, 1789, Louis XVI opened the Estates General at Versailles. The First Estate was represented by 291 deputies, the Second Estate by 270 deputies, and the Third Estate by 578 deputies. After the opening speeches by the King and the new minister of finance, the issue of how the votes would be counted immediately consumed the assembly. The members of the Third Estate learned that it did not matter whether their number of representatives was doubled, tripled or quadrupled. The system, it turned out, was based on one vote per Estate, not one vote per individual representative. Thus as long as the clergy and nobility -- whose interests were usually aligned with each other and with the monarchy -- cast their votes the same way, they would always beat the one vote available to the Third Estate. The deputies of the Third Estate vowed to change the voting system. The issues of tax reform for which the Estates General had been convened never saw the light of day; the assembly could not get past the procedural disagreements pitting the Third Estate against the other two Estates and the monarchy. The situation was complicated even further on June 4, 1789, when Louis XVI's son and heir, Louis-Joseph, died at age seven. The court went into mourning, leaving the fate of the Estates General unclear. Louis XVI, devastated by his son's death, procrastinated even more on taking any action about the Third Estate's concerns. Over the next two weeks, the representatives of the Third Estate refused to give up. With the King otherwise occupied, the deputies of the Third Estate began convincing members of the other two Estates to join them in their grievances. Soon they were joined by parish priests from the First Estate who, unlike bishops and abbots, generally felt great sympathy for the plight of the Third Estate. In addition, liberal members of the nobility (including the Marquis de LaFayette, the French hero of the American Revolution) also joined the Third Estate. On June 17, 1789, the Third Estate made an unprecedented move that, unbeknownst to anyone, would unleash the forces of revolution. These deputies and those newly allied with them proclaimed themselves as a new governing body called the \"Assembl\u00e9e Nationale\" (National Assembly) which represented not an Estate but all the people of France. In one declaration, the ancient institution of France's Three Estates crumbled, striking the first major blow to the system of absolute monarchy. French government and society would change more in the next three years than it had in the last eight centuries. Louis XVI reacted to the announcement of the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale by closing the halls of Versaille where the Estates General had been meeting, claiming they were being renovated. The members of the new Assembl\u00e9e then moved to the vacant tennis court where they made their famous \"Serment du jeu de paume\" (\"Tennis Court Oath\"). The members of the Assembl\u00e9e swore not to disband until France had a written constitution. When Louis XVI then closed the tennis court, the Assembly met in a church in the town of Versailles where their ranks swelled with even more members of the clergy and the nobility. Louis XVI declared the Assembl\u00e9e unconstitutional (this despite the absence of a constitution) and ordered it dispersed. The Assembl\u00e9e defied the King and stuck to their vow not to disband. Meanwhile, Louis had moved French troops and foreign mercenaries into the city of Paris as a \"precautionary\" measure. While the mercenaries were loyal to the King who employed them, members of the French troops began siding with the new Assembl\u00e9e. On June 23, 1789, the King addressed the Assembl\u00e9e, issuing a charter recognizing the right of the Three Estates to meet, but it was a moot point. The ancient feudal system which had existed for centuries had been abolished six days prior. On July 9, 1789, the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale reconstituted itself as the \"Assembl\u00e9e nationale constituente\" (\"National Constituent Assembly\"). On July 11, Louis fired the finance minister and reorganized the ministry of finance. When the people of Paris learned of this, they thought the King had taken this action against the Assembl\u00e9e. The anger over the King's perceived actions combined with fear of the troops stationed in the city, hunger from the chronic food shortages, the lack of resources to procure food, the unfair taxation system and other issues all came together in a perfect storm. The people of Paris began to revolt. Three days later, on July 14, 1789, rebels stormed the Bastille prison, a powerful symbol of France's absolute monarchy. Their goals were to get the weapons cache stored inside and release its prisoners. Although the people took the Bastille by the day's end, they discovered that the weapons had already been moved and the number of prisoners released amounted to less than a handful. Nevertheless, the Storming of the Bastille remains the official beginning of the French Revolution. In August 1789, the Assembl\u00e9e produced the \"Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen\" which would become the preamble to France's eventual constitution. This famous declaration would go on to form the basis of many modern constitutions as well as serving as the basis for the United Nations' Declaration of Human Rights. It should be repeated that the goal of the Assembl\u00e9e was never to depose the king and dismantle the monarchy, nor to create a republic out of the bloody slaughter of the King, the Queen, royals, nobles, clergy, commoners, republicans, royalists, revolutionaries, generals, soldiers, doctors, lawyers, scientists, laborers, city dwellers, country dwellers, the guilty, the innocent and the in-between. The Assembl\u00e9e members simply wanted to reform the government to share the burdens and benefits of being a citizen of the Kingdom of France more equitably. Yet, once the deputies of the Third Estate declared themselves the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, they opened Pandora's box leading to a blood-soaked Revolution and the creation of the First French Republic. On September 30, 1791, the Assembl\u00e9e nationale constituante (National Constituent Assembly) completed France's constitution. True to their oath, the Assembl\u00e9e then disbanded, granting its authority to a new legislative body. The new constitution went into effect the next day. Although this historic milestone -- undreamt of just three years prior -- had been achieved, the darkest days in the revolutionary struggle for \"libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9\" (\"liberty, equality, brotherhood\") still lay ahead...
