            "answer_text": "Limiting the French influence in Madagascar to the usage of French may be reductive. Unlike many former French colonies, Madagascar economy presents a strong presence of French companies. Out of the 7 banks in the country, the 4 largest are subsidiaries of French banks. The largest supermarket retail chain is French. The largest oil distribution company operating is Total. Air France keeps 3 rotations to Madagascar per week, and Air Madagascar belongs to Air Austral (from Reunion Island). Therefore either large companies in Madagasacr are held by French large groups, or by local companies that belong to Indian businessmen holding French citizenship. That\u2019s widely seen in real estate, trade, car dealing, textile factories, food production and export companies, the top 3 businessmen in Madagasacar hold french passports. The trade balance is negative for France with more imports from Madagascar (raw products, raw textile and raw food mainly). Military, the geostrategic position of Madagascar, close to the eastern Africa and between the african mainland and Reunion Island, French department, has pushed French to hold strong military ties with Madagascar, providing military assistance, and by having preempted the Scattered islands, subsequently allowing them to control both the east and the west seas of Madagascar. Socially, Madagascar regroups the second largest French community in Africa, after Senegal and before Ivory Coast. In everyday life, the vernacular language malagasy will be most oftenly spoken, but when it comes to writing, you will not find any administration paper, official form and contract that will not have its double language or french version. Truly, you don\u2019t need to hear French in Madagascar to measure its influence. ",

            "answer_text": "How strong is the French influence now? In a 1958 referendum, Madagascar officially voted for internal autonomy. The people chose to remain in what is now called the French Community.* Madagascar went on to become an independant country in 1960, as the Malagasy Republic. For an overview of Madagascan history since the 1500\u2019s, check the link below. As for how widely French is spoken in Madagascar today, according to \u2018Panorama francophone 1\u2019 (copyright, Cambridge University Press, 2015), the French Ab initio exercise book, Malagasy and French are the official languages. there are about 900\u2032000 French speakers in the country, with a total population of 18 million people. This means that about 5% of the population speaks French. So the answer really depends on whether you consider 5% as \u2018widely\u2019 spoken. *HISTORY OF MADAGASCAR (accessed 1/03/2018, 11:23 am) ",
