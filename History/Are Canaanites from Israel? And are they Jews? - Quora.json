            "answer_text": "\u2026. Are Canaanite from Israel \u2026\u2026 The advanced sedentary Canaanite tribes ruled Canaanite Peleset becoming Palestine renamed by the Macedonians in 332BC. They were Semites just like all the eclectic tribes, including the Shem Semites, who form tribes as late, as the 1180s BC to ward off the Philistines, who would conquer the Canaanite Pentapolis in 1150BC running roughshod over contiguous Peleset for the next 200 yrs., Samson lost. There was no Israel! There were Israelite subjects, as ten tribes, after 933 to 722BC in a 6 village Chiefdom situated on 7.3kkm2 of land within the region of Samaria disappearing due to reneging on tribute to the Assyrians. The Canaan region was never taken possession of whether from Sumerian Abram, Jacob/Israel, nor his 12 Sons, 12 tribes, but settled in the regions Judea then Samaria. Canaanites like the Mayans & Astecs still exist, but w/o political, language or social identity. The ancient Shem Semites are also lost of the two remaining tribes that existed under the Arameans dropping Hebrew for Aramean & probably Judaism as well. Shalim Jewry existed from 1025 to 586BC. Traveling to Shalim in 537 & 520BC, they found Canaanite Shalim had been renamed Jerusalem by the Arameans, it ain\u2019t called Jerushalom. No one of Shalim Jewry ever had ownership or village ruling power in Jerusalem, as their last Chiefdom fell in 586BC & Jerusalem in 550BC belonged to the Arameans! PS There are at least 20 references in the Old Testament speaking of Jerusalem before 550BC, none of them are true. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Cannan/Canaanites is very miss leading term. Canaanites are all the inhabitants of the land that Egyptian occupier called: Cannan, which is on the Bible means the Land of Israel (which later to be called by its foreign conquerors \u2013 Palestine). The Egyptian conquerors gave the land the name Canaan at the end of the Late Bronze Age (1200 - 1400 BC). In ancient Near Eastern archaeology the name is found almost exclusively in the period from which the country was ruled by the new Egyptian kingdom, It was named until the social collapse at the end of the Bronze Age, and it appears very little later in Egyptian sources: the Jews, the Israelites, were formed in Canaan their pre-national-hood period, from the 18th century BC, the time of Abraham, that means before the land was named Canaan. Some of the Israelites, who went down to Egypt at the end of the 17th century - early 16th century BC, returned to Israel/Cannan during the known Exodus from Egypt and Moses era in the 13th century BC. At 13\u201312 BC, the Greek sea-peoples invaded to the eastern plain of the Mediterranean, were called by the Israelites and other local tribes: Plishtim (invaders in Hebrew) and their occupied territory: Pleshet (the land that being invaded). It is interesting to note that most of the Greek invaders invaded to the northern Syrian coast of today, where there was a much larger and more significant Philistine entity than as known today as the Gaza coast.  In Canaan there were seven other nations alongside the tribes of Israel, who also emigrated to this land in various periods, and therefore they were all called Canaanites. It is possible that the new comers call the local inhabitants Cannanites, before they were all were called the same, sometime later. During the time when the Hebrews/Sons of Israel/Israelites/Judeans/Jewish people had crystallized the Israeli nation in the 9th-12th centuries BCE (the beginning of Iron age, the times of the Judges and kings Saul, David and Solomon), most of the other tribesmen perished in wars, emigrated or assimilated into the Israelites/Jews. The name Canaan is an Egyptian and sounds more like a Canaanite meaning of deep purple, scarlet or crimson color. The Egyptians referred to the land as Canaan since the 15th-14th century BCE, and it is interesting that later on the Greeks also called the land Phoenicia, which means the same. Al long as Southern Phoenicia was called Israel, the name later referred only to the Northern part of the land, called later Lebanon (after its typical tree which its flower is white, Lavan in Hebrew). Today, the Carthaginians, who came from Phoenician and Israeli sailors and merchants, also called themselves Canaanites (the name first appeared in Greek Carthaginian letters from Thales of Miletus, 6th century BC).

            "answer_text": "Canaanites were various tribes living in the ancient land of Canaan. The land of Canaan was the region that later became the Kingdom of Israel and Judah. From a biblical standpoint, the Canaanites were wiped out when the Israelites conquered the region; from an archeological standpoint, there is reason to believe that the Israelites actually were the Canaanites (or a subset of Canaanite tribes), with Judaism being the result of the synthesis of two pagan Canaanite religions (accounting for the two primary names for God in Judaism). Regardless, there are no people who are Canaanites today. The Palestinians have sometimes claimed to be descended from Canaanites (in order to try and assert an earlier claim that predates the Jewish one), but there is no evidence to back that claim (and this claim is novel, not made by Palestinian ancestors until there was a dispute to be had regarding the land of Israel).
