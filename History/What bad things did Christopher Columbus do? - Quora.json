            "answer_text": "A brilliant courtier, navigator and entrepeneur,* Columbus made a fairly typical business contract with the crown of Spain in which he was basically given every significant court office that might be assigned to any lands, islands, coasts or what-have-you that he discovered. The idea here is that since no-one knew what he would find, the Crown would confiscate any offices that turned out to be too lucrative, and there would be lawsuits to settle what kind of compensation was fair and reasonable, and of course the estate would never be satisfied by t hat, and there would be complaining forever \u2014but people would get rich, and new lands would be discovered. Really, it\u2019s all super-typically Medieval. Exactly this then happened, and it turned out that the Western Hemisphere is quite a nice place, and the Crown of Spain and the house of Colon made bank. Oh, to be sure, they don\u2019t have all the money, and this half of the Earth has some iffy neighbourhoods, and there\u2019s a lot of someone-done-someone wrong stories in its history, and some of the people who live there put on airs. (British Columbians are the absolute worst!) But, overall, compared with, say, sawing the Western Hemisphere out of the planetary sphere and setting it adrift in space, I\u2019d say, good job, Chris. Unfortunately, there followed people who took all the lawsuits and complaining far too seriously. As is often the case with people who don\u2019t tune whining and complaining out, there was a pile on until it turned out that poor old Chris is basically responsible for everything that ever went wrong that I can\u2019t blame on my co-workers. I think right now we\u2019re blaming Chris for the fact that diseases are contagious? *If you think what he did was easy, you try it. ",

            "answer_text": "Columbus didn\u2019t set out to prove the earth was round.Forget those myths perpetuated by everyone from Washington Irving to Bugs Bunny. There was no need for Columbus to debunk the flat-earthers\u2014the ancient Greeks had already done so. As early as the sixth century B.C., the Greek mathematician Pythagoras surmised the world was round, and two centuries later Aristotle backed him up with astronomical observations. By 1492 most educated people knew the planet was not shaped like a pancake. Columbus was likely not the first European to cross the Atlantic Ocean.That distinction is generally given to the Norse Viking Leif Eriksson, who is believed to have landed in present-day Newfoundland around 1000 A.D., almost five centuries before Columbus set sail. Some historians even claim that Ireland\u2019s Saint Brendan or other Celtic people crossed the Atlantic before Eriksson. While the United States commemorates Columbus\u2014even though he never set foot on the North American mainland\u2014with parades and a federal holiday, Leif Eriksson Day on October 9 receives little fanfare.
