            "answer_text": "I'll try my best to present my opinion regarding the best 30 anime I've watched since I started in 2013. This is not a ranking, and I'll be talking about there shows in no particular order. Steins;Gate My genre of choice in anime basically boiled down to your typical action shows, until I happened on Steins;Gate. This anime was not only my gateway to a plethora of story driven, memorable narratives but it also appeased to the metaphysician inside of me. It makes you connect deeply with the characters, it pulls you into its world, and most importantly it makes you think. Steins;Gate is a classic in its own right, and nobody will regret getting into it. Be warned, it sets such a high standard that it's sequel pales in comparison. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood How can I not love FMAB? This anime has everything you can hope for: story, well paced action, memorable characters, and top notch world building. A story of two brothers you cannot help but cling close to. While the original FMA was good too, it is Brotherhood that doesn't waver from the amazing story presented to us in the manga. I recommend you watch the original first so you can truly appreciate what Brotherhood does better. Two anime with one stone, if you ask me. ERASED While this anime gets so much flak for its ending, I liked the rest of its episodes so much that I simply didn't care. The story presented by this anime is, in essence, very relatable and grounded. Also, hats off to A-1 Pictures for changing the whole Opening just to stay consistent with the story. I really appreciate attention to details such as these. 5 Centimeters Per Second This anime. It's so choke full of metaphors, I keep discovering new ones every time I rewatch it. If I had to describe it in one word, I would pick beautiful. Each and every second of it, I relish it all. Also, it gave me one of my most favorite Japanese songs of all time. Thanks for that, Masayoshi Yamazaki. Hyouka IMG SRC: Minimalist Wallpaper As I said, Steins;Gate got me into amazing narratives, and Hyouka is where that got me. Many might find this anime boring, it's not very fast paced or thrilling at all. In fact, it's something you can watch over a cup of tea. But those who get into it are in for a very relaxing, but intriguing story. If that sounds anything like your type of anime, give Hyouka a go. Tower of Druaga This is not something you see on a \u201cMy Favorite Anime\u201d list. Tower of Druaga is nothing special, I'm telling you that. But that doesn't translate to \u201cits not fun\u201d, which it very much is. It takes everything I love about dungeons and spoon feeds it to you. The protagonist is your typical Neutral cardboard, but it's the support characters in which this series truly shines. Because most of them are actually capable. Plus, I find Neeba's story to be a great addition to ToD overall. PS The first episode is a riot. I wish the whole series was like that, but it takes off into a different genre from episode two. Yona of the Dawn Another series that's not entirely special in any ways, but happens to tell a great story. You can really appreciate the feelings this anime tried to communicate. I can't tell you much because it would count as spoiling, but I really recommend you watch this anime. It's first few episodes are enough to draw you in. Angel Beats! I bet you saw this one coming. Angel Beats was my first take into anime that drive your emotions through a death well. Like ERASED, the producers changed the Opening so that it stays consistent with the narrative, which is as before massively appreciated. The music is top notch, the characters loveable, and the story (mostly the ending) is far more complex than you think. Code Geass Code Geass. From the outside, it might look like another run of the mill Mecha Anime, but you couldn't be more wrong. Infact, this anime is about how a certain green haired girl named CC is the best waifu across all animeverse and not agreeing to my opinion will result in complete annihilation of you and your family. Don't shoot! I was joking! Code Geass presents a great political drama blended in with a lot of things we love about the mecha genre and the Uchiha clan. It's a good gateway anime into its genre, and certainly not the only one on my list. Kill la Kill This anime stands out for its interesting art style and fan service that actually isn't fan service. I give it a gold star for ingenuity, and the story was well presented and paced as well. And the protagonist is someone you either love or hate, like your younger sister. Only you don't watch your younger sister strip, baka. Sword Art Online Just kidding. Hinamatsuri My second favorite anime of 2018, Hinamatsuri manages to be deep and entertaining at the same time. It makes you question your own convictions, yet laugh everything off the very next second. Plus it gives us the cutest father-daughter bonding sequences to be witnessed on screen in a while. A must watch. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time It pains me that not many people I know have witnessed this absolute masterpiece. This is not an anime you delve into after watching the likes of Steins;Gate, it's not to be taken that seriously or you'll be disappointed. But in its own right, this anime presents a very memorable story about a girl who can *hint*hint* jump through time. Noragami It's a series best known for its amazing Openings, moderately humorous dialogues, and the public's favorite stray God. Very enjoyable, my only complain is that there is no sequel in sight. Blood Blockade Battlefront Remember how quirky the premise of cyberpunk feels? Well, that's BBB for you. This anime is downright weird, but in an extremely fun way. The second season doesn't follow a central story, and us more like a promotion to the manga, but it's quirkiness makes it very memorable. Death NoteIf you expect me to talk about this show, you need to rethink life. If the first thing that comes to mind is a Netflix movie of the same name, please DM me your name with your picture so I can make an entry about you in my diary.  One Punch Man One Punch Man is to anime what Doki Doki Literature Club is to Visual Novels. Minus the horrors. And absolute blast, this anime is the ultimate satire ever made about shounen. My only concerns are that it has set the bar too high for its own sequel. Full Metal Panic Full Metal Panic has nothing to do with the Elric Brothers. It's, in fact, a very grounded mecha anime you won't regret getting into. The latest season came out in 2018 and was one of my favorite releases of the year. It mixes high school life with a breed of Elon Musk, military action, and a straightforwardly adorable protagonist. Sword of the Stranger Another movie, SotS is a must watch. Why? Because it combines a very grounded story with one of the mist brilliantly choreographed swordplay I've ever witnessed. You won't be bored for a second. Plus there's a dog! Anohana Angel Beats hardened me up for the next big tearjerker in the form of Anohana. Another anime that's nothing short of amazing, Anohana connects very deeply with you. The whole premise of the show is friendship, family, and the ties that bind. Add to that very carefully written characters and you'll start to see what I do. Love, Chunibyou, and Other Delusions One of the cutest shows on this list, Chunibyou is one of them anime that manage to mix just enough sad with hilarity. The pacing is just right, the premise very nostalgic and silly. I'm sure most of you will enjoy this as much as I did. Fate/Zero One of the two Nazuverse iterations on my list, Fate Zero is by far the most mature of the two. Because it was written by Gen Urobuchi, the same guy who gave us Psycho Pass (up next, kiddos!). Another anime that can make you think a lot and even question yourself, F/Z has magnificent action and a story that captures your attention from episode one. Psycho Pass Screw RoboCop, once you watch this anime you'll forget all about Credit Scores and start asking people about what their Crime Coefficient is. An amazing story coupled with great character development, this anime is should be watched asafp. Also, like S;G, it set the bar too high and it's successor failed to deliver. Fate Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works I can't say if it's the best of the F/SN trio since Heaven's Feel isn\u2019t finished airing yet, but by far this is my favorite route from the Visual Novel. The premise of UBW can be condensed into a Battle Royale of Ideals, and it presents it very well. The visuals are stellar, the action enough to make you go chuuni for a while, and to top that off it can help show you how Saber is the best Fate girl. Your Name An excellent gateway anime, Your Name deserves all the praise it gets. A very unique narrative combined with powerful storytelling an another plethora of metaphors (especially pointers to Japanese Culture), you can wait a few months before watching this again and smile to yourself as you witness everything click together perfectly. Kara no Kyoukai Remember when I said F/Z and UBW were the only Nasuverse iterations on my list? I lied. Kara no Kyoukai is by far my favorite slice of Nasuverse. It doesn't have anything to do with my love for Ryougi Shiki (maybe), but because the story it tells is so damn amazing. Another While this anime felt a bit weak in the start, it really started getting interesting as the story picked up pace. It makes more sense in the novella, but that doesn't stop Another from being a very enjoyable anime. PS it's not as scary as everybody says. Grimgar of Fantasy and AshWhile ToD presented a typical dungeon climbing story, Grimgar hits closer to the RPGs we're familiar with. Heck, it's writer is as big an RPG fan as I am, and it shows. The party mechanics in Grimgar are spot on, and the story very believable. Also, the character development is something you cannot ignore about Grimgar. A Silent Voice Absolutely. Amazing. This movie is as simple as it gets. It digs at our feelings of nostalgia and past experiences and then binds them with a golden thread to the narrative it presents. Everything, from the opening sequence to the precredits doesn't waste a single second of your time. Nothing seems out of place or unnecessary. And trust me, this is one anime you'll never forget. Parasyte Another show that makes you question your convictions, Parasyte can be very grisly at times. It essentially makes us humans look bad. Very bad. But in the other hand it presents a very clean story without any plotholes whatsoever. Not something for everyone, but I personally loved watching Parasyte. Hellsing Ultimate The one anime to purge Twilight out of your mind. The definite proof that they absolutely do not sparkle or spend half an hour everyday staring at obnoxious teenage girls. Only for a mature audience, Hellsing Ultimate one hell of a ride. ",

            "answer_text": "I have watched a LOT of anime , and to be fair , it is not easy to grade anime. There are also countless shows that I have not watched, so it would not be a completely fair list, so please bear with me. 10. Dragon ball Z  Now in my opinion, Dragon ball Z is a fairly simplistic show and is not really that great in terms of plot ,characters or theme, but I do know that Dragon Ball has easily influenced countless shonen anime. It's because of Dragon ball that three huge shows, namely Naruto, One Piece and Bleach were created , which lead to huge influx into the anime community. Dragon Ball is an anime that has laid very clear foundations, which cannot be ignored. Hence, number 10. Personal Recommendation:. I do ask you to pay attention when watching this show. A lot of Dragon ball has influenced anime like Naruto and Hunter x Hunter. Other than that don't take yourself seriously. 9. From the new world  An anime that is truly on a level far beyond that of the commoners. I can say with confidence that this is a very well written ,gripping show. Characters are clearly thought through, and worldbuilding is very well done. Watch this and you will not be the same. Honestly, this show grabs the essence of horror , employing the technique of 'show , don't tell' to very effective use. Unlike Higurashi, Hellsing and Tokyo Ghoul, this anime uses good storywriting as means of disturbing the viewer. Personal recommendation: It's advisable to watch this on a good laptop with a high fps. 8. Mushishi  Deep , disturbing , yet very refreshing. An interesting take on paranormal organisms with complex commentary on morals, loss and moving on. Mushishi is a beautiful anime , and is very compelling to watch. Each episode has its own story, so please refrain if you are looking for a plot. Personal recommendation: You can watch any episode in any order, but I would advise a good colour lcd to bring out the rich green present in this anime 7.Rurouni Kenshin OVA : Trust and betrayal  Hard to watch. This ova reaffirmed my faith in the Rurouni Kenshin series , which although not bad , was truly in my opinion a waste of immense potential. Highly recommended ova. Kenshin's struggles with slaughtering people , combined with incredible direction and animation , makes this a very interesting watch. If you have spare time watch Rurouni Kenshin : Wandering Samurai , but I honestly think it's an utter waste of time. Personal recommendation: I suggest you watch the first ten episodes of the original anime and also read up on the meiji revolution in order to get a good idea of the context. 6. FMA 03 and FMA : Brotherhood  I would probably be stirring up a hornets nest with this one. A lot of people argue that Fmab is vastly superior to the 2003 version. This is absolutely not true. Both these shows execute effectively what the other version lacks. I must warn you however, that although the premise is the same as well as the characters, both move ahead with different intentions and presentations. And no , FMAB is NOT the greatest anime of all time. It's plot is good and its characters are good , but it's just another masterpiece. I refuse to accept that myanimelist is a legitimate criteria, because three versions of gintama don't deserve to be called 'masterpieces'. Personal recommendation: Unbelievably, these two versions are in certain respects as different as chalk and cheese. Their morals and theme are different , and Edward Elric the mc has a different charecterisation in the 2003 version than in Brotherhood. I recommend you watch both versions, but if you like happy endings and are interested in plots, watch Brotherhood. If you like bitter anime, and want to be emotionally invested , watch the 2003 version. 5. Legend of the Galactic heroes  The very fact that an anime that has NEVER been released on television and is over 25 years old has managed to this day be considered possibly the greatest anime of all time speaks volumes of its quality. 4.Stein's; gate.  Gripping. Phenomenal. Energetic. These three words describe the absolute joyride that is Stein's Gate. If you were disappointed with Death Note I highly recommend this anime. There are VERY FEW anime with a plot as adrenaline pumping yet as restricted and closely knit as Stein's Gate. Personal recommendation: Not much , except that you DO NOT SKIP OR FAST FORWARD EPISODES. I also recommend you rewatch it , because a lot of subtle details will pop up that you did not notice during the first time you watched it . 3. Cowboy Bebop.  Impeccable. Exquisite. Well executed. Cowboy Bebop is an anime that is just simple and charming , and yet grows on you like a tumor. This anime is great. Period. It's almost perfect ( except for Vicious the villain of course). And who could forget its soundtrack, one that is in the top 100 jazz albums of all time ? This anime is the definition of cool . The only problem? After you finish it , you're gonna carry that weight. Personal recommendation: You can watch any episode from 2 to 21 in any order, but you must watch ep 1 first and episodes 22 to 27 in order. Since it is a very simple anime , I recommend you go with low expectations. It is NOT some life changing show. 2. Hunter X Hunter ( 2011)  This is visual gold. Masterfully written and executed, this anime is the prime example of Madhouse studio's dominance in the industry. Hunter X Hunter is\u2026.. weird. I can't describe it to you because of how vast it is. And yet it's beautiful. The depth and complexity, the characters, the emotions . This anime is worth its DVD weight in gold. Personal recommendation : I highly , HIGHLY recommend you watch this on a good tv that can get out the richness of the colours so that you maximize the beauty of this show. Buy the blu ray. Buy the manga. I promise you that you will not be disappointed by this anime. This is the poster boy for \u201cDon't judge a book by its cover\u201d. 1.Neon Genesis Evangelion Ok , firstly , I got into this anime because I found the character Rei Ayanami attractive ( yes I am fucking weird, yes I might go to jail lol). Secondly, unlike the other anime on the list , I do NOT recommend Evangelion to beginning anime viewers. Ideally , you must watch Evangelion after: You watch every other anime on this list, plus Madoka Magica, Perfect blue, Saint seya and school days ( yes, school days).You watch a few traditional mecha anime like Macross and Gundam.You understand the concept of tropes and then watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann ( because it's a reconstruction of mecha tropes so you'll understand better P.S HIGHLY RECOMMEND GURREN LAGANN)Understand what a deconstruction and a reconstruction is.Learn a little about shot direction and scene cuts and also Hideaki Anno's story ( He directed this show).Watch Tokyo ghoul, Hirugashi and Akira to desensitize yourself to gore.You then watch Eva. Then: You head over to the evageeks wiki to the theories section where they discuss multiple theories and prove them , showing you how much detail exactly you missed while casually watching.You go check out Digibro and Under the scope reviews for their video essays on evangelion, explaining its depthYou go through the eva lore in order to understand exactly what was happening.You rewatch Evangelion seeing if YOU could catch hold lf any details!There's no doubt about it. Evangelion is a highly polarising anime. You either really love it or you really hate it. But regardless, Evangelion is easily the greatest anime ever. Eva made anime a serious visual medium and not just a 'chinese cartoon'.Eva brought back the anime industry from the dead in the 90\u2019s singlehandedly.Eva employed many new cuts and storyboard methods, revolutionising animeEva itself is a work of disturbing creative geniusEva singlehandedly defined the common anime tropes of tsundere, deidere and pussy boy mc with Asuka , Rei and Shinji.All this and more make Evangelion , in my opinion, the greatest anime of all time ,although it's not the most well known even in Japan. I would also like to say that this is MY list so I subjectively think that these are the greatest anime of all time. I could be wrong as I am just human like everyone else, but I assure you that all these are incredibly well written shows that are enjoyable save for Evangelion. However, most of these shows also have a dark edge to them so if that's not your preference then feel free to ask me about some happier anime :D ",
