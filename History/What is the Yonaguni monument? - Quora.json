While some believe the ziggurat-like formation is from an ancient city, others argue that it was naturally created.  The rectangular monument, which was first detected by a scuba diver, is more than 165 feet (50 metres) long and some 65 feet (20 metres) wide. A number of scholars have visited the site, but its origin remains uncertain. According to some, the monument is a man-made stepped pyramid. Thanks ",
