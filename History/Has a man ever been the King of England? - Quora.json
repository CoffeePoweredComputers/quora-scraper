Does this guy think England was some sort of matriarchal tyranny, or perhaps a cryptocracy? Nine of each ten rulers of England have been men, just as everywhere else in the world. I don\u2019t see the point of this question so I am simply unable to give a direct answer rather than a lecture. Maybe he believes Queen Elizabeth is one-thousand years old? ",
