            "answer_text": "The technical requirement was citizenship. Hitler was made a German citizen in 1932, removing the citizenship barrier to power. The method was simple- get a government job that comes with automatic citizenship, courtesy of Dietrich Klagges. The legal hurdle was out of the way, but why would Germans embrace a little corporal from Austria?  Why was Hitler embraced as a German and permitted to become Chancellor? There are a number of reasons. Hitler had wholly embraced Germany Hitler had fought for Germany in the Great War. He had fought and bled for Germany. Hitler renounced his Austrian citizenship years before after moving to Germany. He had given up his nation for the German nation. Hitler was serving Germany Hitler was leading the party many felt would restore German honor and power- a party that had brought order to the country. This foreigner was focused on giving everything to Germany. A forgivable citizenship Austrians are cousins to Germany. Many- especially in the 1930s- were Germanic and viewed Germany and Austria as two nations of the same people. Had Hitler been French or Italian, he would not have been accepted. ",

            "answer_text": "Why was Adolf Hitler (born outside of Germany) allowed to become Chancellor of Germany? Traditionally, place of birth was completely irrelevant in German nationality law. One inherited the nationality of one\u2019s father (if known), otherwise that of one\u2019s mother. Hitler was originally Austrian because he was born Austrian. In 1925 Hitler renounced his Austrian citizenship. In February 1932 - a mere 11 months or so before becoming Chancellor of Germany - he acquired German citizenship. ",
