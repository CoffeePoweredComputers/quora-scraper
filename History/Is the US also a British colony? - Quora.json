            "answer_text": "It Used to be. Back then, there were only 13 colonies for the British Empire to contend with. But with overburdened taxes being levied, and a general clamp on freedoms, the colonists had had Enough. (At least a majority of them). Sooo\u2026The Founding Fathers (an all White,Rich, \u2018Old\u2019 Men\u2019s club-heheheh), Pledged those fortunes, lives and Sacred honor to start their Own country! They then wrote and signed the Declaration of Independence. July 4, 1776. Welll\u2026Ol\u2019 King George 3 wasn\u2019t too happy about That little move, and decided to send even More British soldiers to \u2018tamp down\u2019 this \u2018colonial rebellion\u2019. We all got to \u2018rockin\u2019 and a rollin\u2019 in a skirmish called the American Revolution-which the colonists-a bunch farmers, merchants and other \u2018rabble\u2019 fought in like it was The end of the world! And it was!\u2019For England. Looks like even England\u2019s enemy joined in: France sent Her ships to the colonies during the end of the war. King George and his minions gave up at That point, signed the peace and the good old US of A was Born. So Every July 4, we Americans celebrate Treason er, Independence Day! ",

            "answer_text": "The US has never been a British colony. There were a number of British colonies in the eastern part of the North American continent. Thirteen of them if memory serves me right. They chose to stop being British, to join together in common cause, and to become an independent country. Other parts of what we now call the United States of America were formerly colonies of other countries. ",
