            "answer_text": "Traditionally Brahmin is a position rather than caste and according to Manusmurithi it was considered as one of the Varnas (doing certain spiritual tasks related to Vedas etc) and as advisers to Kings in the later period. These Brahmins moved to South of Himalayas i.e. Bharat along with different Varna groups like Vaishiyas, Kshthriyas and Sudhras. Gita 18.42 talks of Brahmin quality. samo damas tapah saucamksantir arjavam eva ca jnanam vijnanam astikyambrahma-karma svabhava-jam Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness-these are the qualities by which the br\u0101hmanas work. One history is clear now that the theory of Khyber pass is no longer valid and proved to be a hoax and in fact Aryans migrated to Europe partly and partly to south India Saptarishis are origin of humans but descendants of Rishis are many generations who married to multiple wives from different clans resulting in many other varnam as we notice today depending on the tasks they do. To explain further, you can read below: After Pralayam, Easwer/Parvathy created this world and Vedas and took various manifestations like Brahma, Vishnu and Ruthran. First creation of Human form was Rishis, prominently 7 Rishis and all human beings are descendants of these Rishis only. Rishis lived years and years to decipher Vedas and had several wifes during their lives including sons from different wives. In Satya Yuga, most of humans born to these Rishis are Brahmins (intellect and advisers) and with limited Human population, there wasn\u2019t much problem but as population increased they need people to govern (Sthriyas with valour and strength), then need people to earn & manage wealth for all (Vaishya - traders, etc) and need people to do the labour/work to generate food/wealth (Sudhras - working class) as classifed as Varnams by Manusmrithi. Rishis and their Sons who got married to different wives responsible for human population with different Varnams. As we can understand from these, Brahmins are very much originated from Rishis, may be called as Aryans in this Karma Bhoomi (south of Himalayas) Aryan means well cultured/read and that race is very much in Bharata Varsha i.e. south side of Himalayas where great civilization was born and they are different to dravidians who lived down south of present India. Near the banks of River Saraswathy there existing great civilization which got disintegrated due natural calamities (like earthquakes, etc) and course of river changed its course and still running below the earth surface. During such upheavals, one part of Aryans moved to Europe who cannot really adhere to Vedas or Sanatana Dharma way of life and other part stayed or moved to south of Present India along with other Varnams stated herein. One other depiction of Brahmins especially Tamil Brahmins are highlighted below: This according to historians took place when the Maurya Kings were ruling India, the reason being the new religious revolutions in the north started by Gautama the Buddha and Mahavira Vardhamana which found favour with the kings. The Brahmin migration was in waves and many of them settled down in present telugu country and some of them reached Tamil Nadu. The first groups to migrate to Tamil Nadu were the pro-Shukra Brahmins who were followers of Lord Shiva and the last few waves were the Pro-Brihaspati Brahmins who were mainly followers of Lord Vishnu. Tamil Nadu welcomed these new migrants with open hands. The stories of the migration of Agasthya and his being the founder of the river Cauvery are chronicled in ancient Tamil myth. His disciple Tholkappiyar , who is definitely a historical figure wrote the first book in Tamil viz. Tholkappiyam. This book clearly mentions the existence of Brahmins in Tamil Nadu. There is some evidence pointing out to Tholkappiyar himself being a Brahmin. They were initially called Anthanars or Parpanars or aravor or vediyars. Tholkappiyam also mentions the word Aiyar in one place. Though new to the culture and language, these new migrants learned the language of the country and the ancient books mention many great poets among them in the courts of some very famous kings. These early migrants also brought the concept of Gothras. Bharadwaja, Koundinya, Kasyapa, Kaushika and Atreya Gothras are mentioned in the early sangam literature. Hope these provide some knowledge about Brahmin history ",

Proof- DNA analysis which is 100% accurate also, many literature & written historical records & folk stories exists. (Some britishers brought forward this Aryan-Dravidian theory for divide&rule over Indians, but DNA of a northIndian, westIndian, east indian & south Indian, irrespective of caste,are all same. Hence, scientifically disproving it, We all Indians have same ancestors) ",
