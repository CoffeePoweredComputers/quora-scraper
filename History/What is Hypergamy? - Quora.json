            "answer_text": "Hypergamy refers to marrying up. The prefix \"hyper\" means over or above.[1]. Gamy as a suffix means marriage or union[2]. Here's the full definition: \"Hypergamy (colloquially referred to as \"marrying up\") is the act or practice of seeking a spouse of higher socioeconomic status, or caste status than oneself\"  According to evolutionary psychologists, females have evolved a preference for higher status males because they offer their prospective children both \"better\" genes and greater resources, e.g. food and security.
