            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been bullied for over sixteen years by strangers on the Internet because of the way that my ex-wife depicts our abusive relationship that deny my experience and pushed me until I was suicidal. When I write a new book or appear at an event or solicit our books to a store, a typical \u201cflying monkey\u201d response from a stranger looks like this:  Five years after our separation, I was diagnosed as being autistic, which started to make our dynamic (and many others in my life) all make sense. Imagine an autistic person trying to dance with a neurotypical for a few years. Imagine how mutually painful that is; how hard it is to communicate basic needs and feelings to each other. I figured this would lead to some kind of resolution or at least mutual understanding, but even twelve years after our breakup I am bullied and belittled online on a near-daily basis with people frequently telling me what I believe, spreading rumors of what I have and have not said, and literally overwriting my experience of what, for me, was a relationship that pushed me to the point that I wanted to die. About a year after we\u2019d separated and she had been dating someone else for about a year, I began casually dating. We worked together at the time and my ex began to make fun of me in front of customers, belittle my choices to the staff, and call me \u201cstupid.\u201d She began a public campaign to vilify me, informing people that they had to take sides. Soon, strangers use me as a meme when they think about abuse they\u2019ve suffered themselves.  For all that I know, this person doesn\u2019t know me, has never met me, and yet believes that bullying a stranger is constructive behavior. My ex took textbook symptoms of my autism to say that I \u201cdeserve\u201d my health problems and the outcomes of my social disability:  The same publication is littered with statements of what I think and believe; things that only I could know for certain. I understand that the symptoms of autism can be taxing and difficult and painful and I respect that pain. But does hardship mean that I deserve to hurt and suffer too? Does anyone? Starting about five years after I was divorced, strangers who hadn\u2019t been around at the time took to attacking me. Before I understood the emotional needs of others, I was repeatedly insensitive and callous towards their feelings, hurting people that felt close to me in deep, fundamental ways. I took no pleasure in this. I was confused each time that it happened and ultimately it hurt me too; I cared about these people and wanted emotional proximity with them but had no understanding of how to achieve that. Still, my actions that hurt them. I emotionally abused people that I care about. Taking responsibility for the impact of my actions was the first step towards moving on. I focused on learning how to prevent it from continuing. I do believe that her pain is real and that these efforts are trying to heal the pain. I\u2019ve had twelve to years to read about neuroscience and discovered that the brain holds onto feelings instead of details. These form our experiences which form our reality. Feelings aren\u2019t healed by following a series of semantic demands. Following directions, even for years, can never alone resolve the hurt that has now been shared one-thousand fold. It\u2019s hard to help someone who\u200b \u200bin pain. So instead I\u2019ve watched person after person manifest that empathy by trying to harm someone. I\u2019ve\u200b seen this pattern play out on both sides of many situations. But we don\u2019t look at the longterm consequences of these actions and that mentality isn\u2019t doing anyone any favors. When I finally got out of that relationship, I was so embarrassed about the way that I had allowed myself to be treated (and later when I realized how my actions felt and were interpreted) that I sought refuge. I felt terrorized and was losing my mind. I was too ashamed to face many of the people who had been so loyal to me for so many years. So I went into my shell, moved across the county, and allowed my ex to dominate my narrative, just as I had allowed her to dictate the terms of our divorce. And soon she was literally pushing through my boundaries and dictating my motives, denying my perspective, and telling me what I believe. And gradually, she overwrote my perspective. For years, I adopted her perspective on my life without questioning. From the first time my actions were referred to as \u201cabusive,\u201d every action and statement I take has been filtered through a critical lens of scrutiny. My words and actions were twisted and manipulated, no matter how seemingly innocuous or trying to protect myself, into some form of abusive behavior. When I tried to defend myself, that was interpreted as denying the other party\u2019s feelings. When I apologize, it\u2019s interpreted as insincere and trying to manipulate the situation and regain control. If I wasn\u2019t so utterly terrified to go on the offensive, that would obviously be interpreted as proving and perpetuating my abusive behaviors. It\u2019s like quicksand, and every time that I do what is asked of me, the rules change and I am met with more and more demands. If I tell my story, I am rationalizing and minimizing my actions, while simultaneously avoiding responsibility or accountability for being abusive. Finally, after experiencing twelve years of financial, personal, emotional, and mental damage, that eventually caused physical manifestations in my body, we\u2019ve reached a point where I have nothing left to lose by telling my story. My ex-wife and I have no contact but she uses vague allegations to demand that people stop supporting my work or even being my friend. My ex and other people began to dictate what I was thinking, feeling, and the corresponding morality of that. When people ask for more information or specifics, she insists that they are \"enabling abuse.\"    This has resulted in many people strangers resounding these statements:     And my ex\u2019s resulting glee:  After four years, my ex eventually bullied one of our more prominent authors, Cindy Crabb, into taking a stand against us. It was a hard place for Crabb, sandwiched between being called a hypocrite and a publishing contract that she described as being better than she could find elsewhere. She also admitted that she hadn\u2019t had the problems with us that my ex accused us of, though naturally ignoring nuance and becoming demanding and difficult made the situation worse instead of better:       We did everything that was asked of us on the requested schedule but she somehow still decided that it was \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d Her comments came to be seen as a bellwether of the community. The thing about a boycott is that it requires an \u201cask.\u201d Like, \u201cWe need you to do this or we are withdrawing support.\u201d I cooperated with 20 demands that my ex sent to me in a letter. I cooperated with a mediation group (who promptly disappeared). I cooperated with an accountability process who sent me busy work and then told me that they were too busy, closing with \"It ended because it was too much to deal with over the internet, not because it had been completed.\" And despite my cooperation, it was written that the lack of resolution was solely my fault. The resulting weight of this unresolvable situation caused at least ten different co-workers to quit, including me. And then hyperbole just ran wild:     When I did a Redditt AMA, my ex suggested publicly and privately to dozens of people to go there and make fun of my allergies and disability and ask about things that I've never claimed. And after stirring the pot, claimed that she had paid no attention to the proceedings.     As well as to suggest to people to contact event organizers and have me removed:  I was summarily uninvited from dozens of events across the world. She frames the events of my life in relation to her and accuses me of things that I\u2019ve never done, like going by her house, throwing a steak on her porch, or leaving things at her business:  People began telling me to kill myself and claiming that I had done things like rape that I wasn\u2019t even accused of. The people attacking me were emotionally abusive in the name of\u2026ending emotional abuse:  Or having bold claims of hyperbole without fact checking or looking at brass tacks:  I am autistic. So rules are important to me. If you used the rules of journalism and fact-checking, you would have a very hard time seeing anything specific about what I actually did that was abusive. The executive summary would read more like \"Prior to his autism diagnosis, Joe Biel was insensitive to people's feelings and oblivious to their stated boundaries.\" But online bullying isn\u2019t about resolution. It\u2019s about the power to destroy things. Even the person who tells people to \u201cEnd\u201d me is celebrated and cheered on by their peers:  And when I wrote a book about growing up autistic and learning from it, my ex-wife took it as\u2026being about her:  When I join a neutral discussion group, she pushed strangers to demean me and demand that I be kicked out, this time using her boyfriend as a proxy:  While researching a new edition of one of my books, a strange Facebook account appeared that used a picture I was in and a variation on my name. It began bullying me and the people that I love, calling them enablers and accusing me of terrible things, telling me what I believed, and insisting on what I had and hadn\u2019t done. Funny thing though, the person imitating me didn\u2019t even know what I look like. While they used a photo containing me, they cropped it around the face of my friend Sheldon, a kid who grew up in South Africa, has been through no shortage of shit, and looks nothing like me. Obviously, such a bully does not respond to logic, does not care what happens to me, and operates on some kind of moral high ground because of their apparent didactic politics.  And sent this message to my girlfriend of eight years:  My ex pretended to file a restraining order against me and hired a courier to deliver it. It lacked a judge's signature because there was nothing to suggest that I'd ever stalked or harassed her. Still, it entered the cannon that she had taken \u201clegal action\u201d against me. Then, after we'd had no contact in over a decade, she shows up to attend my book reading event and leaves this note for me to find:   She claims that *I* have a strange need to control the narrative about my life that she hasn't been involved in for over ten years. She abused me in our relationship, leaving me homeless and suicidal. She suggested that people I have working relationships with, friends, and business partners turn against me or there would be consequences. My last girlfriend told her in no uncertain terms, \"leave me out of your smear campaign.\" When my former business partners left and started their own business, she took a stand against and made vague demands of them:    But when my former business partners relented and issued a statement in support of her, my ex relented as well and began supporting them:  I've spent a dozen years going out of my way to try and create healing and closure and it really seems like that's not wanted. It really messed with my head and it's still exhausting. At the same time, while everyone who works with me is bullied about this on the Internet on a near-daily basis, we rarely have someone bother us to genuinely ask what the hell it's all about. Since I\u2019m autistic, after spending years of my life learning normative behaviors of neurotypicals, it\u2019s even weirder and more perplexing that this behavior is considered acceptable and even encouraged. Strangers and even magazine editors failed to do basic diligence, fact checking, and looking at both sides and began to increasingly mock me and my disability in a seeming effort to prove that they believe that taking a stand against me is important. The more that I engaged, the more consequences there were. It continues to be difficult for people to trust that there is an end of the story. The situation began to feel like the the bullying that I experienced in my early teenage years, something that is very common for autistic people. A recent review that is largely sympathetic to my story and nuanced in the writer\u2019s views of the situation still manage to conflate autism with sociopathy, a particularly common misunderstanding: Gave me a sense of how difficult it might be to trust this guy with my feelings\u2026If you know that someone\u2019s doctor gave them a \u2018How to be Caring\u2019 checklist, then how can you ever be sure that they aren\u2019t just checking boxes when they do something nice? Just a few weeks ago when a friend wrote about how words like gaslighting were overused inappropriately beyond their actual meaning, someone claimed to have seen me stalking my ex-wife, something that is actually a clearly defined crime. And after reading the law, something that I have never done. The irony, of course, is that my ex\u2019s actions do qualify as online stalking, which is against the law in Oregon. The more that I\u2019ve cooperated and done what was asked of me, the more that it becomes apparent that resolution isn\u2019t the goal. Still, I think the best solution is resolution; making peace. Throwing around more bullying isn\u2019t helping anything. I\u2019ve tried to take the high road all along. The strangest thing is that, at some point, I became the touch stone whenever someone in a certain sphere wanted to reference abuse:     It toughens up my skin but the fact that this kind of behavior can be made normal on the Internet (and I have no idea what this person\u2019s identity is) is REALLY WEIRD. Update: And then just today I receive an email very similar to one I have received dozens of times:  TLDR: \u201cWe are removing you from our website because people complained that we were supporting you. We didn\u2019t bother to ask for information or even your side of the story. It\u2019s easier to just do what the bullies want.\u201d Can you blame him? Update Two: Many people have asked how this could spiral so badly out of control. Sarah Schulman does a great job explaining this kind of behavior in her book Conflict is Not Abuse, saying: \"Once a person perceives themselves as a victim of abuse, rather than a human being dealing with an uncomfortable and complex situation, they have overreacted and thus have escalated the situation. Now that the situation is escalated, the \"victim\" then uses their self-subordinated position to justify cruel actions.\" Update Three:  Despite my hesitation, after many, many people have asked me to take donations to pay for the creation of a Protective Order, I have relented. I set this up for donations: Donate to Joe Biel\u2019s Protective Order Fund And in closing, more peculiar examples of all of this nonsense:      And \u201cfunniest\u201d of all, the same person trolling me on Quora has contacted my work about this post. That makes FOUR workplaces that were told to terminate me:  If anyone hasn\u2019t seen the long term consequences of entrenchment:  ",

            "answer_text": "The Mandela Effect I had heard this term before but didn\u2019t know much details. Today I came across a detailed article on this topic and it left me absolutely mind-boggled. Nelson Mandela died from a respiratory tract infection on December 5th, 2013. But, why is it that some of us think he died in prison in the early nineties? It\u2019s a phenomenon known as the \u2018Mandela Effect\u2019 , a complete mystery. An enigmatic anomaly on Earth with no scientific explanation. Basically, it\u2019s this theory that Nelson Mandela did die in prison in the nineties. But then, something happened that somehow reversed this event, and he went on to live decades longer, before dying again in 2013. Though some of us don\u2019t remember Mandela dying in the twentieth century, others do. They remember the news coverage, the papers, the heartfelt speech from his widow- but all of it vanished from the universe when this \u201cevent\u201d took place and rewrote history. And all that\u2019s left is this huge collective memory. These people that \u201cknow\u201d he died like this, and all remember that same thing somehow, but it\u2019s \u201cwrong.\u201d There are two theories behind it. The first and less common is time travel. They say that someone went back in time and altered an event just slightly, but it created a ripple effect that resulted in something changing dramatically. But time travel is believed to be entirely fictional and improbable. The more common theory is that there are several universes, all alternate, and that sometimes they \u201crub shoulders,\u201d or, essentially, cross paths. I can swear I remember(like many others) King Tut\u2019s burial mask as having a snake, but I was wrong. At least, partly. There\u2019s a snake. And a bird. A bird that looks so outlandish and unnatural on that mask that I should have remembered. Popular cartoons draw it wrong all the time, too. Have a look below: Real: (Snake and Bird)  Not real: (Just a snake)  Many people remember \u2018The Thinker\u2019 statue as having his fist on his head and not chin. People who had seen the statue went back to see photos and saw the statue\u2019s fist was on his chin, but their own was on the head. See the image below:  How many of you remember the Monopoly guy wearing a monocle? Guess what? He never wore a monocle.  Think about Pikachu\u2019s design for a moment. It has adorable red cheeks, long ears, and a yellow tail with a black tip, right? Wrong. Pikachu\u2019s design actually has a tail that is fully yellow.   Many of us remember him saying \u201cDo you want to play a game?\u201d, and that\u2019s wrong. Jigsaw says, \"I want to play a game.\" This one is the most difficult for me to accept. It\u2019s \u2018LOONEY TUNES\u2019 and not \u2018LOONEY TOONS\u2019  There are many more examples of Mandela Effect, I even took a quiz and failed. Seems like I am from an alternate reality. Scary!
