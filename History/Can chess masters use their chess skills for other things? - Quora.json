            "answer_text": "A little, but not much. I think to the extent skills are transferred from the chess board to other things, the skills are not specifically chess skills. Many of what I\u2019ll describe below are lessons that might just as easily be learned on a tennis court or a football field. With that footnote in mind, here are some other skills one develops in chess that apply in life: mental toughnessobjectivityanalytical thoroughnessin-game and out-of-game patiencecreativity / pattern recognitionTaking them in turn: Mental Toughness This is the idea that you don\u2019t resign a chess game once your opponent secures an advantage. You keep fighting until the fight is done. The flip side is that if you secure an advantage, you don\u2019t suddenly take your foot off the gas and expect your opponent to fold. It\u2019s the same in life. Didn\u2019t get into your first choice school? You make the best of your second choice. Didn\u2019t get your dream job? You keep fighting, to get it next year (in a more senior position). Etc. Or better yet: did you get your top choice school or dream job? Great! Mental toughness means to not stop working to improve yourself. Objectivity In chess, you have to be honest with yourself about whether your position is stronger, weaker, or equal. This is sometimes hard for people to do, so they have to learn it\u2026 painfully. Some people just want to think about themselves, not the position. I.e., \u201cI\u2019m better than him, so I can take this equal position and press on for a win!\u201d This sometimes results in disaster. Same in life. If you have an idea for a startup, no matter how awesome you are, you can\u2019t turn a terrible idea into a successful company. Or maybe a variation on a theme: just because some aspect of an idea is great, that doesn\u2019t mean the whole idea is. Or as Tartakower said (about chess, but I think it applies as well in life): \u201cSome part of a mistake is always correct.\u201d Be objective. Analytical Thoroughness In chess, you get a sense of how far you need to calculate. Games are often won (at least at the amateur / intermediate level) by the player who calculates one move further. The flip side of the coin is that you get a sense for when there\u2019s still a complication in the position, and that you need to keep working to figure out if a move is good or not. Same thing in life. You might have an idea\u2026 do X, then do Y, then do Z, and it will all be great! That might be true up until that point, but if doing Z necessarily means something else horrible, then\u2026 you didn\u2019t calculate far enough. Just by way of a real world example, my friend from law school once called me up all excited. She just got a job offer in NYC, with such-and-such starting salary. I forget what it was, but let\u2019s say $120K / year. (This was in 2005 or so.) She was calling for help in her apartment dilemma: she found three apartments and all had their strengths and weaknesses. So I asked her what she could afford. \u201cWell, $120K/year is $10K / month, and these are only like $3K / month\u2026\u201d So I went through the whole thing with her. What was her take-home salary? What are her expenses besides rent? Does she intend to wear clothes or eat anything? Etc etc. Long story short, she couldn\u2019t afford any of the three apartments. Tough break. In-game and out-of-game patience. What I mean: out-of-game patience is literally the ability to sit and do nothing while it\u2019s your opponent\u2019s move. Different chess players deal with this differently. Some continue to study the board while it\u2019s their opponent\u2019s move, and some use that opportunity to clear their head and walk around. But either way, it\u2019s forced inaction. This can be very uncomfortable to people who grew up being 100% engaged at all times with at least 13 different video games and social media feeds simultaneously. But it\u2019s a valuable skill. By contrast in-game patience is the idea that you don\u2019t have to jump on every opportunity right away. For example, in one of my recent chess games I was torturing my opponent: she had a bad bishop and passive pieces. I had control of the only open file, and great piece harmony. At some point, she offered a pawn to get some activity. I declined to take it, realizing that I could get more if I tortured her more thoroughly. And I eventually did get a decisive advantage, not just a pawn. This is just a variation on a theme articulated by Lasker: \u201cIf you see a good move, look for a better one.\u201d Good advice in chess and life. Creativity / Pattern recognition Chess teaches you to expect the unexpected, or look at moves that superficially make no sense. In fact, some of the most aesthetic and artistic games involve choices that \u201cviolate rules.\u201d Same in life. We all rejoice when things that shouldn\u2019t work, in fact, do work. ",

            "answer_text": "Many skills are very transferable.  Bobby Fischer playing against Fidel Castro.  Mark Taimanov was a world-class pianist. Gary Kasparov is currently the head of the Human Rights Foundation. Capablanca was a diplomat. In everyday life, beating someone at chess is a bit like beating them at arms wrestling - an easy way to establish a small dominance. Stanley Kubrick used to beat his actors at chess. \u201cYou sit at the board and suddenly your heart leaps. Your hand trembles to pick up the piece and move it. But what chess teaches you is that you must sit there calmly and think about whether it\u2019s really a good idea and whether there are other, better ideas.\u201c According to Kubrick himself, he was one of the better New York players back in the 1950s. I don\u2019t know if that makes him a master, but he certainly used that skill to his advantage. It\u2019s likely that the actors started listening to Kubrick a lot closer once he demonstrated his superior chess ability, and thus, his superior intellect. But he\u2019s totally right. Chess at a high level is so mentally intense that I almost think you can\u2019t have anything else in your life other than the game. But on a broad level, the game teaches you to not rush, to plan things out and to keep the mental initiative. That\u2019s a good skill in any situation. Image source: PhilipRother. ",

            "answer_text": "Strong chess players have very good memories and very good internal visualisation. They easily remember entires games that they saw or studied years ago and can discuss chess moves without looking at a board, and they can play blindfolded, holding all of the pieces in their minds, even playing multiple blindfolded games at once. Those skills are widely useful. An accurate comprehensive memory, a sense of the exact ordering of complex sequences, and strong ability to internalise visual information into a mental abstraction where it can be manipulated \u2026 you\u2019re a shoo-in for a doctor, pathologist, radiologist, surgeon, engineer, physicist, and so on. Playing chess in the ordinary way doesn\u2019t say much about your intelligence, but the elite players are exceptional intellects. If Magnus Carlsen was the chief engineer of some ship-building project for a huge Norwegian consortium he would be just as ruthlessly and perfectly efficient as he is at chess. If Wesley So was your surgeon, he would be technically perfect, and fast. If Hikaru Nakamura was handling your investment portfolio, you\u2019d make money. ",

            "answer_text": "A2a\u2014 thanks! To be clear I\u2019m just a casual chess player with an opinion. Not a psychologist, not a professional chess master! But here is how I would ask the question: Is being able to think about sequences of 7\u201315 positioned related objects , fully realizing how the positions themselves are related at a high level to each other useful? When I play chess, I get an almost tactile sensation when I\u2019m missing something that I normally wouldn\u2019t about the position. I like it when I can see the connections and they are spiraling around in possibilities but it\u2019s unclear which is the best. So then in \u201creal life\u201d when I\u2019m working on a tough new algorithm or trying to understand a big code base I aim for that same sensation. The hazy fog , not the one where I\u2019m probably missing something! My theory is that many things boil down to cultivating a similar mental model of systems 7\u201315 relationships. 8 notes in the major musical scale, 12 in the chromatic. Words we commonly use tend to be within that range as well. 7\u201312 letters long. A byte is 8 bits. When considering different possible cases in any type of argument , I find that we tend to glaze over after about 4. So (again just pure speculation in my part) it seems like to \u201cmaster\u201d or to be \u201ccompetitive\u201d in many types of mentally involving tasks we need to learn the relationships between at least 7 objects like the back of our hands. I think chess is great training for both gaining experience of seeing what that\u2019s like to having to do it under time pressure. Indeed back in the poker boom of the early 2000s, there were many poker stars who switched over from professional chess. It speaks to my theory because although they are both \u201cgames\u201d of intense strategy , they really don\u2019t seem to have much in common with each other! 13 cards in a suite\u2026 chess is a game of complete information. It\u2019s all on the board for all to see. poker is a game of incomplete information, only some of the information is available to all and much of it is private. Things like physical \u201ctells\u201d or twitches unintentionally revealing something are important to leverage. This seems to have absolutely nothing to do with chess! So why so much cross over success? I think it comes down to my theory. Chess players are good at managing branching sequence of about the same number of relations as on a poker table. Typically not more than 10 players per table, forming relationships over small amounts of shared and private information. What\u2019s also interesting to me is that in time constrained games, chess can have a \u201cbluffing\u201d element. Making a complex piece sacrifice that will take away 20 seconds of your opponents time can win the game whether or not the move was sound in the untimed sense. So chess can help develop a feel for finding these \u201cblind spots\u201d. Obviously useful in poker! From poker, all we have to do is read a few popular tales from finance books like \u201cLiars Poker\u201d to see that it\u2019s a game that is directly related to the markets\u2026 That\u2019s just my .02, thanks for reading!

            "answer_text": "I saw some excellent answers here already, so I\u2019ll just add a bit. I think that most chess masters are highly intelectual, and their intelligence, as well as their capacity for hard work and study on abstract subjects, shows in other fields as well. I\u2019m sure GMs and IMs don\u2019t fail to add this skill to CVs to demonstrate exactly that. As for me, I\u2019m not a master, but I think my fascination with chess has shaped my thoughts and perhaps my memory. As for my thought process regarding the future, if I try to look at it from the outside, this process from the game, to outline courses of action and try to predict results, has become my thought process in real life too. I find myself less surprised by actions or occurrences in real life, relative to other people. whether it results from the discipline of chess or not, is hard to say, but it\u2019s likely that chess strengthened this tendency. My memory in a few areas has surprised many people on many occassions. Chess develops chess memory for certain, but it may affect other areas of memory. A2A! And by a Son of Quora, no less!! Thanks.
