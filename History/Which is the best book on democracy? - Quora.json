            "answer_text": "Honeybee Democracy  Honeybees make decisions collectively--and democratically. Every year, faced with the life-or-death problem of choosing and traveling to a new home, honeybees stake everything on a process that includes collective fact-finding, vigorous debate, and consensus building. In fact, as world-renowned animal behaviorist Thomas Seeley reveals, these incredible insects have much to teach us when it comes to collective wisdom and effective decision making. A remarkable and richly illustrated account of scientific discovery, Honeybee Democracy brings together, for the first time, decades of Seeley's pioneering research to tell the amazing story of house hunting and democratic debate among the honeybees. In the late spring and early summer, as a bee colony becomes overcrowded, a third of the hive stays behind and rears a new queen, while a swarm of thousands departs with the old queen to produce a daughter colony. Seeley describes how these bees evaluate potential nest sites, advertise their discoveries to one another, engage in open deliberation, choose a final site, and navigate together--as a swirling cloud of bees--to their new home. Seeley investigates how evolution has honed the decision-making methods of honeybees over millions of years, and he considers similarities between the ways that bee swarms and primate brains process information. He concludes that what works well for bees can also work well for people: any decision-making group should consist of individuals with shared interests and mutual respect, a leader's influence should be minimized, debate should be relied upon, diverse solutions should be sought, and the majority should be counted on for a dependable resolution. An impressive exploration of animal behavior, Honeybee Democracy shows that decision-making groups, whether honeybee or human, can be smarter than even the smartest individuals in them. ",

            "answer_text": "These are not in order of preference, but will provide you with a good understanding of the history of democracy: Bernard Crick, A Very Short Introduction to Democracy (Oxford, 2002). This provides a short but accessible discussion of the origins and key components of democracy. John Dunn, Setting the People Free. The Story of Democracy (London, 2005). Very well written and more detailed account of the development of \u2018democracy\u2019 from ancient times to the present. Paul Cartledge, Democracy: A Life (Oxford, 2016). The work predominantly concentrates on Ancient Greek/ Athenian democracy and then uses that template to examine later incarnations of \u2018democracy\u2019 throughout history. JS Maloy, The Colonial American Origins of Modern Democratic Thought (Cambridge, 2008). This work is more obviously aimed at an academic audience, but it offers valuable insights into how American democracy emerged: the country that is credited with creating modern \u2018democracy\u2019.
