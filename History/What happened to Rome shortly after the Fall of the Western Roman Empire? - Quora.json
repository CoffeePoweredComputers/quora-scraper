            "answer_text": "Some good answers but to answer in a somewhat different way \u2026 First, it is a myth to think that there was some big barbarian invasion that caused the Western Empire to suddenly collapse. That never occurred. The Western Empire was decaying for some time. What is generally characterized as the \u201cFall of Rome\u201d in 476 was an internal coup, by a military leader, actually a very common way power was transferred in the Roman Empire. What made this transition somewhat unique was that it was the first time that somebody had taken over that was not a Roman citizen. However, to characterize Odoacer as a foreign invader is somewhat ridiculous. He was a member of the Roman army (albeit as a mercenary) and his people had been living in the Empire for quite some time. Anyway, to answer the question more specifically, 476 did not mark any major transition point. The city of Rome continued to function as a commercial center, just not nearly the center it had once been. But the whole West was gradually decaying as it fragmented. The city of Rome, though, had not collapsed at this point. What did mark a major transition point was the reign of Roman Emperor Justininian (in Constantinople, not Italy). He wanted to reunify the Empire. But what he did was essentially to decimate some of the population centers of the Western Mediterranean, Rome in particular. By the end of the 6th century, the city of Rome was nearly empty and remained that way for a long time. There was nominally a Pope in Rome during much of this time but arguably only a symbolic leader. It wasn\u2019t until Charlemagne captured Italy that Rome really started to come back. ",

            "answer_text": "What happened in 476 was just formalising legally what had already been the case since 461, namely that the barbarian generals (Ricimer, Gundobad and then Odocaar) in the \u2018Roman army\u2019 were the actual rulers, rather than a puppet emperor controlled by them. I dont think much changed in 476. Rome had not been where the court was based since 311AD. Its population had been devastated by the Goths and Vandals and probably fell from maybe 500,000 in 400AD to 80000 in Theodorics kingship. In fact the city of Rome was probably better off under the Ostrogoths as Theodoric brought nearly 40 years of stability from constant Vandal raids, and unlike the emperors was religiously tolerant until late in his reign. Theodoric also built an impressive palace, images of which survive in the mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna. There was a small revival in philosophy through the writings of Cassiodorus and Boethius, who he also employed as ministers. The Roman offices like the Praetorian Prefecture of Italy and the Senate continued. Games (not gladiatorial ones though) continued in the Colosseum until around 540. ",
