            "answer_text": "No the gladiators were not vegan. Those who say they were vegans do so because they have an interest in converting to the vegan diet or distorted ideologies related to it. It seems that the diet (sagina) of gladiators consisted mainly of vegetables such as legumes, cereals, onions, garlic, fennel seeds, fruit and dried figs. Meat was scarce, since it was expensive, but there was no shortage of eggs, dairy products, oil, honey, wine. Before clashes in the arena, to gain energy, gladiators usually ate spiced barley buns sprinkled with honey and drank fenugreek infusions (trigonella foenum-graecum). This type of diet was functional in becoming fat. In fact, fat is a protection against muscle injuries. Fat not obese, their phisical structure was like one of the boxeur of early XX century. The gladiators have nothing to do with the Holliwoodian image, which the Romans would probably have considered as not very virile. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Roman gladiators were indeed vegan. Their vegan diet of beans and barley helped them have peak physical condition. Low fat, high carb diet allowed gladiators (or hordearii) improved blood flow and cardiovascular health while providing more than enough protein to build their powerful physiques. Images from ancient Rome showed that gladiators looked like bodybuilders. There are no images of fat gladiators.  Their bones showed that they were so reliable and robust that the archaeologists speculated that they must have been drinking plant-based milk. So, they proved that people could produce enough vitamins and minerals without animal food. ",
