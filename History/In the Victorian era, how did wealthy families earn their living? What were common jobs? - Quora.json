            "answer_text": "The wealthiest families were the upper-classes, which included the Royal Family and Hereditary Peers (dukes, earls and viscounts etc). None of these worked for a living. The Royal Family of course was wealthy to start with, but also received income from private estates and from the government. Hereditary peers were also rich to begin with, and these too earned money from their inherited estates which had tenant residencies and farms. It would not have been uncommon for an earldom to own a few hundred properties. Some earls invested in industry, like the Earls Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, who owned coal mines and other industries in the North of England, and as a result became one of the wealthiest families in Britain. Their family seat is the largest manor house in the UK:  You can read about them here: History - Fitzwilliam Wentworth Estate | Wentworth, Rotherham, South Yorkshire The lowest level of the upper-classes was the landed gentry. These were the landowners with manor houses, and there were hundreds of them. They were still part of the British nobility, but the heirs didn\u2019t carry titles. Many were allowed to use the term \u201cesquire\u201d after their name as they were earmarked for knighthoods. Sometimes they received the non-hereditary titles of \u201cLord\u201d. They generally inherited manor houses, owned estates with farms and tenants, and lived a comfortable life. However these were amongst the first to suffer when estate taxes (death duties) were introduced in 1894. It meant heirs could no longer inherit without paying a large tax. As a result, many estates were sold off and lineages petered out. The demise of the country squire is a subject of an excellent book by the historian P.H. Dichfield, The Old English Squire, published in 1912. So who are left? The middle classes\u2014the ones who had to work for a living. In the Victorian times this was a class growing in size and power, but it comprised a broad spectrum of people with vastly differing incomes and social status. The richest of these were the industrialists. Then there were the well-salaried professionals, who also enjoyed a high social status, such as those working within the clergy, medical doctors, lawyers and civil engineers. Below that was the lower middle-class, such as teachers, clerks, journalists, medical assistants, druggists and accountants and so on. These were not wealthy, but earned enough to have a modest house and lifestyle. Many of their households would have had at least one servant, even if it were an apartment. ",

            "answer_text": "Wealthy is always comparative The world before the Great War is very different to our own. A great many people, certainly compared with today, were able to live on a private income either generated by investments or land. Technically this is the definition of a gentleman. Some of these were not that wealthy, there were a number of people in London who lived on the income from Railway Shares in very small houses with one lowly paid servant to answer the door (a gentleman did not answer his own door), technically these were gentlemen and thus wealthy, but some skilled working class men, including, ironically, top link engine drivers, had more disposable income. As far as possible inheritances, certainly of land, were maintained in the hands of the oldest son (the splitting of estates greatly weakened foreign countries like France). The oldest son had to prepare for the responsibility of being head of the family and the younger sons had to do something - Army Officer, Barrister, Clergyman and MP were respectable occupations. Many wealthy families liked their sons to experience at least a short term of employment to teach responsibility. Quite a number of these, in the higher echelons of society, learnt responsibility by being a Foot Guards Officer which many did not do very long. The Guards almost never went on Foreign Service in those days except in the event of a major conflict, were based in London or handy for it and were able to allow generous leave due to the excellent NCO\u2019s and Warrant Officers.
