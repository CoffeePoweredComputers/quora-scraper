            "answer_text": "Ronald Wilson Reagan was born in 1911. If he were alive today, he would 107 years old tomorrow, February 6, 2018. Assuming that he had all of faculties (which were failing him more than 30 years ago) then he may not like Donald Trump, although as a B-movie actor Reagan certainly kissed a lot of asses in the past and might do so if the role of Trump supporter required it. My opinion: At 107 years of age, I doubt that Trump being POTUS would matter to Reagan, one way or the other. The few moments that he might be lucid during the day would likely be spent eating or watching television, not worrying about Trump or anything that has to do with him. ",

            "answer_text": "Ronald Reagan\u2019s hate for Donald Trump would likely be relative to how much money in campaign contributions Trump had given to him over the years. I will say, cozy-ing up to the Russians may not have earned Donald much favor with Ronnie, but this, again, is dependent on money and favor. Reagan, after all, infamously said in 1967 he could see \"no reason why on the street today a citizen should be carrying loaded weapons\", and subsequently signed a bill in California as governor which repealed a previous law allowing public carry of firearms. A few years later, reagan had no problem doing the bidding of the NRA as they eventually helped push him into the White House and into the path of a bullet of his own. Point being, Reagan was a politician, and an actor. He may have been just fine with Trump if the price was right, and he could plausibly deny doing something and pin it on someone else. \u2026 like, for instance, selling arms to rebels in Central America by way of Iran.
