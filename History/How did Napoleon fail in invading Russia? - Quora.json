            "answer_text": "Essentially, the Russians lured Napoleon deep into their own territory, a strategy which dangerously overextended the French army\u2019s supply and reinforcement lines. Also, as the Russians fell back towards Moscow, they fought a series of torrid, bloody rearguard actions which turned the advancing French army into a badly beaten up and demoralized winner. The Battle of Borodino, fought 70 miles outside of Moscow, was a key factor in Napoleon\u2019s downfall. In this encounter, Napoleon risked everything in an effort to inflict a decisive, crushing defeat on the Russians. But all he accomplished was to achieve an indecisive win, which was barely better than a draw. Worse yet, Napoleon\u2019s army suffered irreparable damage at Borodino, losing at least 27% of all personnel, the better part of his horse fleet, and a horrifically high number of upper-ranking officers (including 49 generals). By the time Borodino was fought, Napoleon was too far away from his closest supply depot to replenish his victorious but battered army. By contrast, the Russians - who had lost 40% of all personnel at the battle - were operating in the middle of their own country. This meant that, within weeks, the Russians had fully reinforced and resupplied their army, and were soon in a position to take the offensive. Noteworthy is that Napoleon made the fatal mistake of leading his exhausted, depleted troops into Moscow following Borodino. He did this on the off-chance that losing the city would induce the Russians to negotiate peace. But no-go. The Russians engaged in fake negotiations with Napoleon for six weeks, just to lure him into a misplaced sense of confidence that the war was ending. In truth, the Russians were hoping to fool Napoleon into remaining in Moscow until early winter, knowing that heavy snows would trap the French in the city during the cold months, where they would be at risk of starving. When Napoleon realized he had been deceived, he reluctantly decided to lead his army 250 miles back west, to Smolensk, which was his closest source of supplies and reinforcements. But Smolensk was a full three or four weeks march from Moscow, and when the retreat began, the French only had about ten days of food rations left. Additionally, the lack of horses (because of losses at Borodino) meant that the French army lacked sufficient mounted cavalry to forage for food, or to do reconnaissance, or to drag its hundreds of artillery guns. Because of these adverse conditions, the French would be vulnerable to Russian attacks during their retreat, at least until they reached the safety of Smolensk. Almost from the start, the French retreat turned into a rout. Within days, they ate most of their remaining horses to avoid starvation. Soon afterwards, more and more of the French troops devolved to the level of weak, starving, unarmed stragglers, incapable of keeping up with the army\u2019s quick marching pace. As this happened, Russian Cossack cavalrymen swarmed the French from all sides of the road, launching raids on stragglers in addition to capturing what was left of Napoleon\u2019s constantly dwindling supply train. For the most part, this is why the French army disintegrated on the road back to Smolensk. Another factor in Napoleon\u2019s defeat was that the Russian army, led by the cunning Kutusov, pursued the French in a way intended to menace them without actually attacking and risking battle. The Russian strategy had the effect of forcing Napoleon to double and triple his army\u2019s marching speed in order to avoid Kutusov\u2019s troops, who always hovered nearby in full force. Consequently, even more French soldiers were rendered weak and exhausted, and upon falling behind their units, were easily killed or captured by the Cossacks. Contributing also to the Russian victory was that Kutusov, although unwilling to risk a full-scale battle with the weakened, retreating French army, did on occasion launch limited offensives on isolated French corps commanded by Napoleon\u2019s subordinate commanders. In this manner, a considerable portion of the French army - by this time nearly defenseless - was destroyed in a series of small scale attacks over a period of days at the village of Krasnoi. Because of these disasters, Napoleon was compelled to abandon his plan of wintering in Smolensk, or anywhere else in Russia. He eventually abandoned the shattered remnants of his army and returned to France to mobilize fresh troops. By the time this was accomplished, in early 1813, the war had shifted to Europe. ",

            "answer_text": "Because of a few major problems, the Russian winter, bad supply chains and a scorched earth tactic used by Russia. Napoleon relied heavily on his troops living off the land instead of long supply routes because they would slow down his army and he relied on getting to his destination as fast as possible. But living off the land and getting to his destination quickly relied on good roads and good agriculture. Something Russia had neither of, making the tactic that worked so well in areas like Prussia nearly obsolete. Further, Russia's scorched earth policy ensured even further problems for Napoleon. Everywhere the Russians retreated from, they destroyed before Napoleon could get there. Food was scarce for both soldiers and horses. In the first month alone 10,000 horses had died. Disease and sickness began to take hold as the soldiers had less to eat. Typhus and Dysentery plagued his army the longer they marched into Russia. By the time he reached Moscow, 200,000 of his 600,000 man army was dead or hospitalized from disease. When Napoleon retreated from Russia, winter had begun and the cold began taking it's toll. The weakest and sickest died first, and then the ones who were strong began to die as well from the sub-zero temperatures. By the time the Grand Armee crossed into Poland, only 100,000 of the once unstopabble army remained. So in the end it really boiled down to weather, disease, lack of food, and the Russian terrain and weather. ",
