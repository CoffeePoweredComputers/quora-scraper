            "answer_text": "It depends on the time period. Before the Greco-Persian wars, feelings ranged from despise to admiration. Herodotus really liked the Persians. He traveled to the heartland of the Persian Empire and become astonished of the architecture, peace, organized bureaucracy and mailing system. He described Persians like honest and plain people, who teach their children to value truth above everything. Philosophers like Demokritus, travelled to Persia to study the achievements of the Empire in architecture and astronomy. On the other hand, archaic Greeks despised Persians a \u201cslave people\u201d because they had a King and they were subjects. Ironically, actual slavery was rare in the Persian heartland, but that is another story. Greeks believed that Persia lacked \u201cfree citizens\u201d who master themselves and participate in politics, thus, their cultural achievement would be low, and their mentality would be that of a servant. Nevertheless racism was not that widespread in the Classical Era of Greece. Aeschylus in his tragedy the \u201cPersians\u201d, states that the Greeks defeated the Persians, because Xerxes\u2019 arrogance angered the gods, not because they were superior. Exploring Greek Tragedy: \"The Persians\" of Aeschylus [Lecture] During the Peloponnesian War the Athenians as protectors of the Ionian city-states of Asia Minor and proponents of the democratic state, were firmly anti-persian, at least polically. The Spartans, however, who were more oligarchic, occationally allied with the Persians. The Spartans defeated the Athenians in the Peloponnesian War after the former finally built a navy, which was funded by the King of Persia. In exchange, after the war, the democratic Ionian city states were annexed by Persia. For the following years the Persian diplomacy funded all Greek states against each other, to prevent a greek attack in Anatolia, and this didn\u2019t go unnoticed. However, many Greek hoplites served in the Persian army as mercenaries. The most prominent was the warrior-writer Xenophon who fought in a Persian Civil War. He admired the legandary King Cyrus the Great, and wrote a book about him the \u201cKirou Paideia\u201d or \u201cCyrus\u2019 Education\u201d, with Cyrus as a role model. Just before Alexander\u2019s conquests, Greeks started to become racists. Aristotle thought that barbarians, because they were subjects to kings, they were natural born slaves, fit for servitude. Isocrates, believed that the Greeks should have as a primary goal to unite and subjugate the barbarians, mainly the Persians. Later, Plutarch would accuse Herodotus, who made positive statements about the Persians, as being \u201cfilo-varvaros\u201d of \u201cfriend of the barbarians\u201d. The cause of this shift was pilled anger from persian political influence in Greece, and a thirst for expansion in Asia Minor. The decline of the city-state system has changed the mentality of many Greeks towards a unified Greece, but not neccesarily democratic. In parallel with this attitute, many Greeks within the city-states, like the Athenian Phokion, started to openly support Athens to willingly admit the hegemony of King Phillip II of Macedon. Alexander, however, liked the Persians and attempted to merge Greek and Persian civilizations. He ordered greco-persian mixed marriages, wore persian clothes, employed persian officials and even demanded people to bow before him, like a Persian King. His efforts died with him, and the Diadochoi , the Successors, treated Persian lands as occupied territory, and nothing more. To sum up; Archaic/Early Greece - Admiration and critisism, High Classical Greece - Cautiousness and cooperation, Late Classical Greece - Hostility to the point of open racism. ",

            "answer_text": "Likes them and not so liked them. Persians had been expanding into Greek Anatolia and later mainland Greece. They (contrary to what some are going to say) enslaved Greek people, installed tyrannical governments, and razed Athens to the ground. The invasions halted at the battles of Salamis and Plataea when the rivaling Greek city states were forced to band together against the incoming threat. So, for the most part, Greeks didn't like them. The Macedonians, however, were allies/vassals of the Persian Empire and got along moderately well, for the most part. Alexander the Great was obsessed with Persian culture. He wanted to integrate Helenism into the conquered Persian Empire, and Persian culture into Greece. ",
