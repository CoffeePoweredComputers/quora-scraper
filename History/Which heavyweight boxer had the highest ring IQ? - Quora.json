            "answer_text": " Only one of these four great fighters operated at HW, therefore the answer is simple- it\u2019s Ali. Even before I saw the above picture, my gut instinct answer would have been Ali - he was comfortably the smartest HW boxer of all time . And believe me, during the highly competitive 1970s, he needed every last ring IQ point he could muster, as he was oftentimes physically out-matched by superior opponents. In addition to facing much harder hitting opponents during the \u201870s, he was also well past his own physical prime & so on various occasions had to call on his smarts to bail him out of trouble.  Here is Ali\u2019s now legendary \u201crope-a-dope\u201d tactic. A crazy bespoke fight tactic, suicidal in fact- not to be found in any coaching manual\u2026\u2026\u2026..but this was Ali - there surely had to be method behind the madness. Notice how high is gloves are, classic peek-a-boo defense, completely covering his head & chin\u2026\u2026\u2026.For Ali this was a very unusual & uncharacteristic guard because he had spent the better part of his previous career ( prior to facing the massive punching Foreman) carrying his hands habitually low. In this career defining fight, he literally gave the headhunting Foreman, no head target whatsoever but allowed him to pound on his body with impunity. In the intense African heat & humidity, the plan was obviously to wear out his stronger but equally dim witted opponent by soaking up the bodyshots & literally going through the pain barrier. On the night, the rope-a-dope worked a treat & Ali\u2019s all-time legendary status was sealed- largely because of his ring IQ. \u2026\u2026\u2026Years later, American rapper Ice T, once commented on \u201cthe rumble in the jungle\u201d & said , \u201c You can be the hardest cat in the jungle but when you get tired\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d I think Ali himself said it best on the Michael Parkinson show , \u201c George ran out of gas & there was no filling station nearby!!\u201d  This was probably the most famous exhaustion facilitated KO of all time & notice from Foreman\u2019s posture he is definitely \u201cdown but not out.\u201d His version of events was that he was watching his chief second counting to 10 & that his cornerman had only reached the count of 8, whereas the referee had already got to 10. If you watch the fight footage carefully, Foreman\u2019s version of events is accurate & that was indeed a notoriously fast 10 count from a highly dubious African referee. Other than Ali, I think prime Tyson also deserves to be mentioned, as he too had a surprisingly high fight IQ - especially so given that he was a brawler. Larry Holmes was smart, as was the old school Gene Tunney - he was very smart. Lennox Lewis & Wlad Klitsckho also stand out in this department. As much as it pains me to admit it, so too does a juiced up Holy\u2019. He was after all smart enough to realise that he needed performance enhancement - just to survive in the division of giants. ",

            "answer_text": "If we\u2019re just talking ring IQ \u2026 it\u2019s probably Gene Tunney\u2026 Please bear in mind that IQ is strictly a mental asset\u2014with no consideration for physical gifts. In over 80 fights Tunney only lost only once\u2014when major cuts opened above both his eyes from terrific head clashes that also battered his nose and mouth.. Gene lost torrents of blood but made it 15 rounds vs Harry Greb\u2014who he defeated 3 times in their 5-fight series with a draw. Tunney was knocked down only once in his career, by Jack Dempsey. He beat the count and controlled the fight the rest of the rounds, retaining the heavyweight championship\u2014and earning a the first 1-million dollar payday ever remunerated to a boxer for a heavyweight championship title defense. Tunney fought with a very low guard, utilizing clever head and body movement to evade punches of every variety. He was a master of infighting, body punching, jabbing, footwork, feinting, combination punching and defense. He had very brittle hands and credits this for his mastery of defense. Out of necessity his defense had to carry him through fights were both hands were broken. He\u2019s the only man to ever stop the clever boxing Tommy Gibbons. Other exceptionally clever heavyweights were: Jack Johnson\u2014a master of infighting, body punching and defense who fought with a low guard and influenced Tunney\u2026 Johnson beat Jim Jeffries, Joe Jeanette, Sam McVea, Sam Langford, Jim Flynn and Frank Childs. Larry Holmes\u2014a master defender, with perhaps the best left jab in Boxing history. Holmes won his first 48 fights, including 21 straight heavyweight championship fights\u2014beating fighters like Ken Norton, Muhammad Ali, Mike Weaver, Earnie Shavers, Tim Witherspoon, Trevor Berbick, Gerry Cooney, James Smith, Ray Mercer and Carl Williams, Lennox Lewis\u2014a 6\u20325\u2033 X 250 student of Emmanuel Steward. Lewis\u2019s 84\u2033 reach and rapier jab brought him wins over Vitali Klitschko, Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Ray Mercer, Oliver McCall, Hasim Rahman and David Tua. Wladimir Klitschko\u2014a 6\u20326\u2033 X 245 student of Emmanuel Steward. His quick foot-work, punishing jab, left hook, and thunderous straight right brought him victories over David Haye, Sam Peters, Chris Byrd x 2, Eddie Chambers, Ruslan Chagaev, Sultan Ibragimov, Lamon Brewster, Hasim Rahman, Ray Mercer, Jameel McCline and Tony Thompson. He developed his defensive finesse to such a degree that for 10 years he rarely got hit with a hard punch. Vitali Klitschko\u2014the 6\u20327\u2033 X 247 mayor of Kiev, who was never knocked down in his career and was always winning unanimously on points after every fight\u2014including his only 2 losses which came by way of injuries. He was the only fighter who ever stopped Kirk Johnson, Vaughan Bean and Larry Donald. He also beat Shannon Briggs, Corrie Sanders, Danny Williams, Herbie Hide, Tomasz Adamek, Chris Arreola, and Dereck Chisora. Anthony Joshua\u20146\u20326\u2033 X 250. The fastest and most athletic heavyweight on this list. AJ has the most unrealized potential. He has a quick accurate jab, a spearing right hand counter, a crushing left hook and a devastating body assault. As George Foreman said, \u201cAnthony Joshua has everything you\u2019d ever want to see in a heavyweight\u201d of course George said that before AJ lost to Andy Ruiz. Joshua\u2019s already beaten Wladimir Klitschko, Alexander Povetkin, Joseph Parker, Carlos Takam and Dillian Whyte\u2014but Ruiz\u2019s slipperiness, toughness, punching power and physical heft pose a unique set of problems. He\u2019s a nightmare match-up for AJ\u2019s style... Let\u2019s see if the rematch brings anything different. Tyson Fury\u20146\u20329\u2033 X 255. Fury out-boxed Wladimir Klitschko by leaps and bounds. He out-boxed Deontay Wilder most of the way\u2014but right hand devastation is a threat for anyone who faces the heaviest hitter in the history of the division. Wilder only needs to thread the needle once to end your night\u2014great chin or not. Fury ballooned up to 400 lbs as one point and still looked far from his physical peak with fab flopping around. Deontay looked extremely thin, like he hadn\u2019t eaten in a couple weeks. Reportedly he had an intestinal issue. He looked bigger, stronger and more powerful against Breazeale. They both should be substantially better for their rematch. Olexsandr Usyk was a brilliant cruiserweight, but seems to be having a seriously hard time making his heavyweight debut. He\u2019s had several heavyweight fights scheduled since his last engagement in November. It\u2019s a question as to whether a 215 pound heavyweight is still a viable proposition in today\u2019s heavyweight division\u2014like it was when Evander Holyfield made the leap. One last note. A boxer with the highest of ring IQ\u2019s doesn\u2019t pull straight back from big left hooks. He has a skilled body attack. He doesn\u2019t lay on the ropes absorbing unmerciful punishment that leaves him diminished by the end of his career. Those aren\u2019t the habits and practices one sees in a brainy boxer. As a master boxer we all know loves to say, \u201cSkills pay the bills.\u201d EDIT: September 23, 2019 My stalker, John McGlothlin, calls me a liar. He says I\u2019m inventing every lie possible. To put my opinions down, he says I\u2019m a racist and nationalist who\u2019s not an American and I\u2019m against American blacks. McGlothlin also says Anthony Joshua has the ring intelligence of a ring post... For one thing, it\u2019s not possible to win an Olympic Gold Medal with so few amateur fights, and win 7 of 8 world heavyweight championship fights, and make over 100 million dollars, if you\u2019re as dumb as a ring post... McGlothlin picks Muhammad Ali over Gene Tunney as having the highest ring IQ ever. That opinion is perfectly fine with me. He calls be a liar for putting Tunney on top. Tunney was knocked down only 1 time in his life, and has 1 loss in over 80 pro fights... Ali was knocked down 4 times and has 5 losses in 61 fights... Tunney was never stopped in any fight. Ali was not only stopped, but badly beaten up... Tunney never laid on the ropes taking a beating in his life. Ali had a penchant for laying on the ropes and getting hammered\u2026 Tunney was a great infighter and body puncher. Ali had no body attack and no infighting game\u2014except for clinching. Clinching is illegal under Queensberry rules... Ali clinched a record 20 times in the 1st round of the Foreman fight. An honest referee would have warned him sternly and point deducted him if he kept excessively clinching and wrestling. My stalker claims I named numerous fighters as \u201cmost intelligent\u201d which is a lie. I posted several examples of \u201cother exceptionally clever heavyweights\u201d but never said anybody else had \u201cthe highest ring IQ\u201d other than Tunney. My stalker says Larry Holmes was \u201ca surly, nasty, person\u201d and ducked Jimmy Young\u2014who was born within a year of Holmes\u2019 birthday. He says Holmes wanted no part of Young who had many losses. It\u2019s a lie to say Holmes didn\u2019t want Young. The article McGlothlin posted from Mike Apple\u2014a UPS driver\u2014proves Holmes wanted to fight Young. Jimmy Young belongs in the Conversation | Wildfire Sports: News and Podcast Network Apple states Young won 13 of the 15 rounds vs Muhammad Ali. Then Apple says Ken Norton was picked off and \u201cclearly\u201d beaten by Young. So Apple is a big Young fan. That brings us to Young vs Ocasio\u2014which presented another opportunity for Young to fight Holmes. Holmes beat Norton on the same night\u2014for the world heavyweight title. Apple says Ocasio won a \u201cclose and controversial decision\u201d over Young. There wasn\u2019t much controversy about Ocasio\u2019s win. Ocasio beat Young, but nobody wanted Holmes vs Ocasio. A Young-Ocasio rematch was sought because Holmes vs Young was a better match-up. Apple said he thought Ocasio won the rematch when he watched the fight. Apple wrote \u201cthe heavyweight champion, Larry Holmes, said that he would fight the winner of this fight.\u201d That statement proves Holmes wasn\u2019t ducking Young\u2014who was the favorite to win. Holmes wanted to fight Young. He wanted Young to win. Holmes hated fighting Ocasio. He was not a big name. Ocasio was not a money fight. Holmes-Ocasio was a ridiculous mismatch against a novice. Holmes destroyed Ocasio with a vicious, one-sided battering and brutal KO\u2014which surprised nobody. It\u2019s funny that McGlothlin called Holmes a cherry picker. Ali fought novice Leon Spinks rather than Holmes. Then Holmes won the heavyweight title stripped from Spinks by beating Norton. Ali then pretended Holmes didn\u2019t exist. He refused to acknowledge Holmes or fight him for years. He fought Spinks again and retired. Holmes was unavoidable at that point. My stalker relies on hearsay and quotes, many of which are bullshit, that Holmes ducked Foreman. Young beat Foreman, but couldn\u2019t even qualify to fight Holmes. It\u2019s very odd that Holmes would be afraid of a man who couldn\u2019t beat Jimmy Young\u2014and Young couldn\u2019t even beat Ossie Ocasio in 2 tries. My stalker claims Holmes ducked \u201cMikes Dokes, Greg Page, and Pinklon Thomas\u201d Dokes was knocked out by Gerrie Coatzee, who was not a terrific heavyweight.. Thomas was outboxed by Trevor Berbick, a guy Holmes beat easily.. Page was badly outclassed by Trevor Berbick and Tony Tubbs. My stalker say Vitali Klitschko had \u201cno ability to adapt his style whatsoever\u201d Vitali Klitschko was unanimously ahead on points after every single fight of his career and fought until age 41. He\u2019s never been knocked down and his only 2 losses came by way of a totally separated rotator cuff assembly\u2014and cuts from insidious fouls by Lennox Lewis. Vitali was unanimously winning both fights. Vitali retains all his brain cells because he\u2019s the mayor of Kiev and worth 80 million dollars. His younger brother Wladimir ruled the heavyweight division for 10 years while rarely getting hit with a solid punch. At age 41, Wlad lost to England\u2019s star heavyweight champion\u2014the then undefeated Anthony Joshua\u2014in an 11-round thriller that featured very little clinching\u2014and very high velocity exchanges. If you fight 69 heavyweight fights over 21 years, and come out fresh as a daisy as Wlad did, you have to have some cleverness about you. McGlothlin continues to say I claimed I was introduced before a major fight as \u201cThe world\u2019s hardest punching heavyweight\u201d which is a LIE. It wasn\u2019t a major show or a fight. Nobody gave a crap. This was an obscure boxing exhibition in front of a huge hotel where a bum heavyweight about 20-2, who never should have been ranked, had a spare-mate who didn\u2019t show. His manager begged me to fill in and slapped money in my hand. I didn\u2019t have my gear. They gave me a useless mouthpiece. I had to wear pathetic looking borrowed trunks and 23oz spar gloves that were pillows. I was a raw amateur with 2 or 3 fights. It was a joke. To make matters worse his manager introduced me with ridiculous hype about my punching ability. He pissed his fighter off. His fighter beat the crap out of me in round 1. Not that he hurt me, but I looked bad. I was a freakin\u2019 novice. Billy Mitchell, his trainer, kept telling him to walk me down. Glenn Morgan\u2019s dad jumped up on the ring apron and screamed at me after the 1st round. He told at me to fight back. \u201cTear that MFer\u2019s head off and get him out of here. He\u2019s a bum.\u201d Wow, this is just an exhibition. Why\u2019s he freakin\u2019 out? But I respected this Morgan character. I came out and threw sharp combinations. I\u2019d done a lot of heavy bag work for a few months, so at least I could throw. With the second volley, I caught him with a left hook that dropped him flat on his back. There was no referee or count, but they stopped this little exhibition. This unfortunate episode is factual. If it were a dangerous heavyweight I wouldn\u2019t have taken the money. ",
