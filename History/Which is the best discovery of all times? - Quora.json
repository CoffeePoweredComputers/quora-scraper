            "answer_text": "Human society exhibit such a level of interconnectedness, that it is often hard to isolate an single discovery as the most important discovery. However, if I am to categorize discovery such that it impacted social life in an unprecedented scales, following are the candidates that come in my mind: Invention of weapons: Stone based weapons such as javelins allowed to hunt in easily, provided protections against dangerous animals like tigers/lions. This is the first manifestation of human capacity for intelligence to protect themselves.Discovery/Invention of agriculture: This led the foundation for providing the basics, without needing to hunt. Helped to provide more time for intellectual pursuits.Discovery of wheel/fire: This definitely had a great impact in the transportation and lifestyle.Development of tribes/nation: The modern idea of democracy had many turns of trials and errors. Pursuit of a perfect system for ruling, and the emergence of democracy can be considered one of the best discoveries human have developed.Now these may be what one may consider ancient discoveries. But we have greatly benefited from the works of our ancestors. From the aqueducts of roman empire to calendars, we have inherited a great deal. As for the modern times, the most important discoveries that come into the mind are: Germs: Perhaps one of the important discoveries is Louis Pasteur discovery that diseases are caused by germs. This along with the increased awareness about the sanitation, has more than doubled average human lifespan.Transistor: Twice nobel laureate J Bardeen discovery lies at the heart of computation. Arguably what distinguishes our century from any other society.Modern Physics: From the radio, to television, to quantum mechanics, to traveling to space, all have sprouted from the work of brilliant mind in physics. I am saying physics in the widest sense of the word to include engineers, chemists and scientists who worked in projects to send rockets to the Moon.Discovery of DNA: After the discovery of cell in early seventeenth century, discovery of DNA is one of the most important discovery.Intelligence: From the artificial intelligence to the experiments that are currently underway to understand the working mechanisms of the brain, the current unparalleled work in this field would undoubtedly be one of the most important discoveries. Compared to other fields we may not have done much in this field due to its infancy, but I am sure the future will heavily depend on this ground.",

However it's left to the individuals perspective. Many of the inventions and discoveries are result of chain reaction of some other inventions or something found accidentally. I have listed few inventions from different ages. The Ancient World : The invention of the first stone tools more than 2 million years ago was the moment when humankind started to distinguish itself from all other species in the planet.
