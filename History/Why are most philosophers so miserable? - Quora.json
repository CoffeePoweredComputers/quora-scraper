            "answer_text": "Occupying oneself into philosophical questions (thus being a philosopher at least \u201cby my book\u201d) can be a quite miserable life because sometimes in philosophy there are more unanswered questions than answers, no matter how much one may contemplate on them. At times it contains the potential to be seen as useless a useless craft due to its lack of practicality. Why indulge in philosophy in the first place, what is the purpose of philosophy? I believe that the point of philosophy is to create or reveal answers to deep and usually unanswered questions. This is why philosophy, in ancient times, was considered as a type of science, if not identical to science. Today there are many fields, mostly if not all of them technical and mathematical, which may give answers to some important questions, leaving the functionality of philosophy in our age at a low rate in comparison to other fields of interest and work. If you may agree that frustration can be a type of misery, then the practice of philosophy itself can be a miserable state of being, where minimal amount of answers, if at all, are found to important and worldly questions. Just think about a person who so eagerly wants to solve a problem, but never reaches a fully satisfying or a generally agreeable solution. This is philosophy nowadays: hard to practice, very complex and esoteric. Some today may not even now what \u2018philosophy\u2019 is, because they may never heard of it before in their life! Regardless of the misery I sometimes find in philosophy, I still continue to indulge in it, i.e, continue to be prone to misery (but not all of the time, fortunately) because it is my field of interest and a good source of existential meaning. Pain may be just a part of being a philosopher, but not necessarily entirely. It can also bring a sense of calm and mental satiation after a good day\u2019s writing session. Logically speaking, at the same time every other person, who is not a philosopher (i.e indulge in philosophical questions), may be miserable like a philosopher could. I agree that philosophy can bring also happiness and satisfaction with the notion that it brings meaning, something which compensates on the constant cognitive hardship. Nevertheless misery can serve a role in philosophy: it can possess an indication of self-worth and purpose in this field; that, I quote from Seinfeld: \u201cThe wheels are in motion!\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "It goes both ways, I think. Depressed people can become to introspection and philosophising\u2026 Usually in a nihilistic fashion. But there are various schools of thought in philosophy which can be very depressing. Nihilism, for instance, which postulates the utter pointlessness of existence. All you accomplish, all you endure, it\u2019s all ultimately meaningless. Additionally, there\u2019s an element of human nature. Those that are content, do not question. Discontent can quite easily grow into depression. ",
