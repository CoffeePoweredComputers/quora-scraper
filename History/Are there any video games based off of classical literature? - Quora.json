            "answer_text": "Spec Ops: The Line is based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness.  If you want to get more classic than that, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a loose adaptation of the Chinese Journey to the West, published in 1592. The entire Dynasty Warriors franchise is based off of The Romance of The Three Kingdoms, a really old series of Chinese oral histories that were finally published sometime in the 14th century. Microsoft's Age of Mythology is based on stories of Greek, Egyptian and Norse gods and goddesses, written in ancient (read: BC) times. God of War falls in the same vein.  There are many more that I haven't mentioned, but I'll stop here for now. ",
