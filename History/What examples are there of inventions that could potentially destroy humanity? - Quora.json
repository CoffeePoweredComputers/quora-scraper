            "answer_text": "1) Nuclear technology (probably the first thing that comes to mind for most people when this question is asked). If you had any idea how close nuclear fallout has come on our planet, simply due to things as trivial as computer glitches, you would shutter in sheer terror. ONE EXAMPLE:For a few crucial moments on September 26, 1983, Stanislav Petrov held the fate of the world in his hands. When an alarm suddenly went off at Soviet nuclear early warning center Serpukhov-15, Stanislav was responsible for reacting to a report that five American nuclear missiles were heading toward the Soviet Union. Rather than retaliate, Stanislav followed his gut feeling and went against protocol, convincing the armed forces that it was a false alarm. His decision saved the world from a potential devastating nuclear holocaust. 2) Artificial intelligence. Not really a whole lot to say here. We've all seen movies like \"The Terminator\" or \"The Matrix.\" However it may happen, one thing is certain: Mixing the intelligence, imagination, creativity, and brutality of humans with the processing speeds of today's (not to mention tomorrow's) super computers, would make one devastating force to be reckoned with. Let's hope they have the same ethical programming that Data had in \"Star Trek: TNG\" as opposed to Lore's. 3) Nanotechnology seems a bit far-fetched without A.I., since, even if they could reproduce faster than roaches, wouldn't their miniature hard drives still be susceptible to magnetism, which our bodies largely withstand? But... anything's possible in the future. 4) Genetic manipulation/biological warfare. We can all agree, whether it comes from DNA tampering or the desire for biological warfare, an epidemic could quickly spread across our world now that we are more interconnected than ever. This could happen deliberately or inadvertently. 5) Experimentation catastrophe. Their were a lot of fanatics out there when the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) announced that it was about to smash subatomic particles together at near light speeds. Some speculated that a miniature black hole could be created that might envelope the Earth and surrounding debris. Of course, this catastrophe was nothing to worry about, really, as particle collisions happen all the time in nature, and we're all still here. If you would like to read up more on the safety of the LHC, there is more information here. However, in the future, who's to say that experimentation doesn't grow proportionally into more \"dangerous\" territory? And it doesn't have to be just black holes, you know? I wouldn't get too concerned over this one, though. Scientists are usually very skilled when it comes to predictions involving things like numbers and data. 6) Attracting a malevolent extra-terrestrial powerhouse. Since we began ejecting our first satellites and emitting our first radio signals into the expansiveness of space, we have committed ourselves to creating a sort of beacon that surrounds Earth like a bubble, ever expanding as it travels outward from our little rock. As it currently stands, in the vastness of even our little interstellar neighborhood, this bubble is probably far too small for any other intelligent life to detect, but as time progresses one day the signals might just attract the attention of intergalactic marauders, resource hungry advanced civilizations, or, who knows, even superior warrior races bent on cosmic conquest. If our radio signals are detected, all a potentially threatening race would have to do is find the center of this outwardly expanding bubble to determine its source of origin. Likewise, if any of our satellites are intercepted, simply retracing its steps in a straight line would lead right to our doorstep. All risks considered, I still think it was a wonderful idea to get what little of a signal we can present in this dark universe out there for any others who might be watching to see. After all, who's to say that a neighboring intelligent community couldn't have the solution to our next largest global disaster? Not to mention the raw information we could gather from their technology, philosophy, mathematics, science, and even culture! 7) All of our technology (industry) combined (Climate Change). The world is quickly reaching a Point of No Return for preventing the worst impacts of climate change. With total disregard for this unfolding global disaster, the fossil fuel industry is planning 14 massive coal, oil and gas projects that would produce as much new carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2020 as the entire US, and delay action on climate change for more than a decade. Continuing on the current course will make it difficult \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 to prevent the widespread and catastrophic impacts of climate change. The costs will be substantial: billions spent to deal with the destruction of extreme weather events, untold human suffering, and the deaths of tens of millions from the impacts by as soon as 2030.

            "answer_text": "Nuclear technology? Given a massive adoption and minimum care about our self, almost any technology can destroy humanity. If you go back a few decades will be able to see lots of examples. TNT where invented to miners but used in wars for example. At the other hand, inventions that can destroy humanity in a single use are not so many. Even nuclear explosions are not large enough to blow all of us in a single event. So far in testing and wars, humanity has detonated a couple of hounded of nuclear bombs and you see, we are here yet. So nothing come to my mind that are terrible enough to destroy humanity with the push of a button. Any actual universal destruction will need a lots of people working hard to, well, to destroy us. ",
