            "answer_text": "1. Eat less high protein foods. Meat is a great source of protein and energy, but proteins tend across a population to make people, or the population, more prone to violence. 2. Many violent situations are promoted by the person assuming the violent position doing so becasue they see no alternative. Yet we all seem to realise after the fact that alternatives existed but we ignored them. The easy way around this is learn how to learn more. Not just learn more things and educate oneself, but learn how to learn, to do so quickly. This will increase options available in potentially violent situations. 3. Ensure you are aware of your violent limitations, ensure you know what presses your buttons and gets you angry. Then simply stop these from making you angry. If for example a particular politician makes your blood boil then this is a button that has been pressed. Learn how to switch it off. 4. Consuming Drugs and Alcohol do NOT have a short term effect on your mind. They have a rather long terms effect. Some drugs will make you less prone to violence. Others will make you a raving lunatic. Desiring anything will give you a rise in Dopamine that can precipitate a rise in adrenaline. Ensure you lower your capacity to \u2018desire\u2019 things greatly as this is a violence button. 5. Basic meditation has been shown time and again to make practitioners less violent. Its not clear why this works but it does seem to work. It might be an inward looking realization of self, and increase in conscious awareness that overrides instinctual actions. Or it might just be that it increases intellect a tiny bit. But it does work, in more cases than not. 6. Emotive response is an absolutely necessary trait. Without it you would be dead or incapacitated in days. BUT some emotional responses are remnants of abilities your ancestors needed to survive. Was that the wind or a leopard? Is that a storm or just my blurred eyes? Is that an enemy or a friend. These emotive responses are no longer needed in modern civilized society but you retain them becasue they are a genetic trait and not easily dispensed with. The only way around this it to compensate by increasing other traits you have. Try this, right now\u2026 deliberately get annoyed about someone or something that makes you violent? Picture it in your mind, get really riled up, annoyed to the point you want to do some harm. Fine? Got it? Right take some money from your pocket and literally hand it to the fist person you see\u2026 Doesn\u2019t matter who it is, or how much it is. Or alternatively go buy a small bunch of flowers and when checking them out hand them to the person at the counter and say for you! then walk away. NOW\u2026. which of hose events do you VALUE most? Well the answer to that is to train yourself by DOING the one you value most repeatedly until the other is destroyed. I would imagine the look of sheer bemusement on the face of a lady behind a counter in a newsagent would be many times more acceptable than the slight satisfaction you got from annoying someone else.

            "answer_text": "When I was younger on a few occasions I got so angry I blacked out. I couldn't control myself and would wake up moments later confused about what happened. I vowed never to do that again. I learned to stay away from things that may cause this to happen again, things that can effect your judgment. So, no alcohol or drugs. Which is fine because I find both disgusting anyways. Next, surround yourself with kind hearted and loving individuals. If you are surrounded by people who are violent, angry, and negative that's how you'll become. Lastly, your recreation and entertainment. Do you find yourself listening to music that makes you upset or angry? Do you watch movies that highlight violent and destructive habits? Do you play video games that get you into a uncontrollable rage? Maybe you should try to limit your time with these. Anyways, that's what helped me, and many others with the same issues come to gain control over their emotions. ",
