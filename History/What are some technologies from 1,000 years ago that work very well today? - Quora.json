Our modern concrete lasts on average (as I have read, please correct if I\u2019m wrong), 50\u201360 years before problems start to arise, with some exceptions of buildings lasting 150 years without problems. The ancient Romans, however, had concrete that has lasted 2000 years to date and still standing. Unfortunately the recipe was a closely guarded secret and was lost. To the best of my knowledge, we have not yet rediscovered the recipe. ",

            "answer_text": "One that is truly ancient is the Hammer, which actually predates modern man by a couple million years. Modern hammers are made from better metals than those of a thousand years ago, but are still used for basically the same purposes. Another ancient tool is the Axe, which has been around almost as long as the hammer in various forms. Yet another ancient member of the million-year club is the Knife. If you took a modern version of any of these and showed them to an early Homo Sapiens of 500,000 years ago, they\u2019d know what they were and would be able to use them instantly for something useful. They may wonder what the claw in a claw-hammer is for, but they\u2019d get good use out of the \u201cbusiness end\u201d quite quickly. ",
