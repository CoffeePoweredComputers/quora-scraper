            "answer_text": "A2A What is the history of technology? The question is so broad, the best I can do to answer it is to give you some context to my personal perspective. The implementation of technology has been my profession for more than four decades. Building websites telling the stories about the history of technology has been my passion for more than two decades. As a passionate geek who loves technology, who is also a cranky cynic that hates buzzwords, as I sort through the various stages of the evolution of technology in my writing, I am trying to give context to the jargon. In my stories of the history of technology I start with looking at various machines powered by animals. In the very basic definition, beasts of burden refers to animals used by humans to perform various tasks, such as pack animals used to carry heavy loads. In the context of studying the evolution of humans and machines, I look at working animals such as horses that were domesticated to power the machines of humans. In the next stage of technology I look at the evolution from living horse power to machines with the invention of steam powered machines. One of my favorite times in the history of technology I call \u201cthe age of railroads and robber barons,\u201d roughly the period academic scholars call the Second Industrial Revolution. George Westinghouse, one of great American inventors of the era, started out inventing various products for the railroad industry and moved on to defeating Thomas Edison in the War of Currents. As you can see by my history here at Quora, that's where I have spent a lot of time answering question. My next major wave of ideas is the birth of Silicon Valley, the semiconductor stories of the 1950s and 1960s, the internet pioneers of the 1960s and 1970s. I already have much of the content edited, just doing some final editing to spin it to the web. That's a quick brain dump of my ideas as I sort through the history of technology. One of the few television shows I watch on a regular basis is \"Mysteries at the Museum\" on the Travel Channel, and yes, I do visit as many museums as I can every year on my annual road trips. Studying the history of technology is my passion. The topic is so vast, to summarize the history of technology in a few hundred words for this question does not do the topic justice. ",

            "answer_text": "Its way simple to understand. The word Technology doesn\u2019t mean only to the things which are not visible to our naked eyes ( Radio waves and computer programs, etc.,) . The history of technology started right from the first human being evolved on this planet. When they learned to drink water (which was the foremost life source) using a bowl or deep shaped stone, instead of drinking by bending over the water body to drink directly using their lips. And the evolution of Technology started right from the moment when they made bags out of animal skins to store water and food and carry then wherever they moved. THE POINT TO BE NOTED HERE IS THAT, TECHNOLOGY IS THE COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE TO LESSEN THEIR BURDEN AND GET THE WORK DONE MORE EFFICIENTLY i.e., WORKING SMART INSTEAD OF WORKING HARD. So, the history of technology started right from the first humans itself. ",
