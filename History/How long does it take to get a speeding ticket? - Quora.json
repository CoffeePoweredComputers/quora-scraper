            "answer_text": "Anywhere from three to thirty minutes. If the cop is efficient and just wants to be done with you as fast as possible, that\u2019s the three minute one. It helps when they are using a computerized system so they just have to input a few things like name, dl#, plate #, infraction, location, and the system puts in the rest. Presto, instant ticket!! During this they might still be waiting for dispatch to say you aren\u2019t wanted for anything else. Then you might get the cop who decides to work on other paperwork while you are cooling your tires. I see this as misuse of police powers, as their job is to enforce the law, not hand out punishments. But it happens and I can\u2019t fix it. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you are asking how long it takes from the moment you pull over to when you drive away with your ticket. It really depends. I think the best answer is 15 minutes but it varies widely depending on how long it takes to run your license and plate information through the dispatcher for wants and warrants and other variables.
