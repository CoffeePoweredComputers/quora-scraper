            "answer_text": "I am going to go ahead, disagree with the other answers and say yes, pretty much. Now, I agree that the Ottoman empire was a multi ethnic one and that Turkic tribes were only a small part of it. It's also true to some extent that these Turkic tribes did not enjoy a particularly good reputation. However, Turkey was not founded solely on these Turkic tribes. Rather, Atat\u00fcrk declared that everyone being in these newly found country is Turkish, despite what ethnic affiliation he or she had before. Everyone who hadn't left Turkey or wasn't resisting this new identity (the vast majority) was now Turkish. A new historical narrative was made up and voil\u00e0, you have new state. The ethnic composition was and is largely the same as in the ottoman empire. Surprisingly, after speaking Turkish and living in Ottoman lands for hundreds of years, most European and non-european people didn't just leave because they weren't Turkic. The culture of this newly founded Turkey also was and is largely that of the Ottoman Empire, not that of Turkic tribes which culture you can witness in Central Asia. Heck, the family of the former ottoman sulta still largely lives in Istanbul and sees themselves as Turkish. So do a lot of the former ottoman elite families, irrespective of whether they once were Turkic or not. Have you never wondered why Turkish people have such diverse looks, ranging from blue eyed blonde people to brown skinned middle eastern looking people? If you don't believe me go ahead and check the 23andme results of Turkish people. On average, European dna ranges somewhere from 5\u201350%, Western Asian 30%-80% and Central Asian Turkic DNA somewhere around 0.5%. ",

The ruling class was predominantly Turkish, although there\u2019s at least one scholar who points out that even the Sultans were at best half-Turkish pretty early due to concubinage. After the First World War, the Ottoman Empire (which had been teetering on the verge of collapse for a while) imploded completely and was succeeded by many of the modern states of the Middle East, including Turkey which controls the old Ottoman capital of Istanbul. You\u2019ll often see, particularly in European sources, a lazy equivalence between \u201cOttomans\u201d and \u201cTurks\u201d. This is realistically the equivalent of saying that everyone in the USSR were \u201cRussians\u201d, when a great many of them weren\u2019t anything of the sort. ",

Ottomans on the other hand are the continuation of a group within Sultanate of Rum, made up of some Turks as well as other ethnic groups like Greeks, etc. Over time Ottomans became a real empire which meant that the notion of the nation was completely removed as empires embody nations while not being one themselves. The concept of Turkish is relatively new and most of the ruling class in Ottomans were Turkish. As an ethnic group they continued to form Turkey after they won independence from the Ottomans. For some reason the terms Turkish and Ottoman are interchangeably used in various places but there\u2019s no direct correlation between them. ",

Ottoman Sultans married foreigners, had strangled extramarital newborns who born from Turkish women. High ranking services were privileged to non Turks. The Turks had two duties which were dying in wars or farming in Anatolian wastelands, only to gave away what they had to the palace. The Turks were backbone of the state, but they had no right to tell what they were and what they needed. This is the biggest treason to Turks who carried the Ottomans into marble palaces from yurts(tents). In the last days of Ottoman Empire, the country was surrounded by inner and outer traitors & enemies. The Ottomans had finally found a salvation; the country may freely be invaded by the Allies, but let the Ottoman dynasty live! The Ottomans declared Atat\u00fcrk and his resisting Turks as \u2018traitors'. The Ottomans announced \u201cwhoever draws a gun on the Greek invaders, draws a gun on Allah himself.\u201d They assembled an army (kuvayi inzibatiye) to strike down the resisting Turks(kuvayi milliye).

This clan, as already had happened with other local Seljuck clans and chiefs, had been in intermarriages with old prominent families of the Greek-Romans of Byzantium. When the Ottomans prevailed over the rest of the local states, sultanates etc of Anatolia, they set the basis for an empire state which gradually extended for some centuries from the plains of Central Europe to Ehtiopia and from Morocco and Sahara desert to the Persian Gulf (for some period I think also a part of Indonesia became a vassal state of the Ottomans). Within this huge geographical area, the notion about the term \u201cOttoman\u201d would gain a new meaning, by incorporating in fact a vast number of populations regardless their nationality and religion.

So yes Ottomans were ethnically Turkish. The citizens of Ottoman Empire was varying as this was a multi ethnic empire but ruling class of the empire was always the people from Turkish ethnicity. That was always like that in all the other Turkish Empires founded in the history as well. The difference between all the other Turkish empires and Ottoman Empire is that it had a more tolerant administrative system than the others. Therefore people from many different ethnic origins too could come to the high positions in the empire. Ottoman intellectuals all had the sense of nationality and etnicity even though they could speak other languages as well and that is true for all the Turkish empires founded in the history as well.
