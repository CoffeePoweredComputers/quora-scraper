            "answer_text": "Alexander was not Greek. He was Macedonian(at first). Hellenes(Greeks) at that time made a distinction between themselves and those of Dorian descent. Kind of similar to how a Native American person might view anyone not of Native American descent claiming to be American. The Dorians had invaded/migrated into Greece 800 years before Alexander and were likely(absolutely) responsible for the ancient Dark Age that changed Greece from a Mycenaean(real Ancient Greece) civilization to what would eventually be the Greece of Alexanders time. The Dorians were much lighter in appearance than the (Mycenaean) Greeks and more European looking, which is why Alexander having light/blond hair was definitely possible. The two most popular groups of Dorian peoples still considered outsiders to Greeks in Alexanders time were the Macedonians and the Spartans. These people were very different culturally to the other city-states in Greece and were considered sorta quasi-Greek and not really trusted. That lack of trust probably had something to do with their warlike cultures and the distant historical memory of them being actual civilization wrecking barbarians. The Dorians get included in so much of Greek folklore after the dark age ended. You can see the tremendous effect they had on Greece in the actual depictions of Greeks before and after the fall of Mycenaean Greece. Before the dark age Greeks were always drawn as dark curly haired people with swarthy skinned men and pale skinned women. They always seemed to be eating food, working a field or sailing ships. After the dark age descriptions of them seem to change into a more European looking people with depictions of war, men with spears or images associated with the anger of the gods. The Dorians changed Greece and yet eventually Greece changed the Dorians. By Alexanders time the differences between the two cultures was so small that the world probably viewed the Macedonians as Greeks. So Alexander and Macedon was Greek to the world but not at first to the Greeks. Yet they did eventually accept him not because he was Greek, Macedonian or Macedonian Greek but because he fought for the Greeks and inspired them(except Sparta) to put their petty differences aside and fight for one common cause. He might have not started out Greek but he definitely ended up Greek. ",

            "answer_text": "Because ancient Greece (Hellas) was never a united entity as is today. At least not before Alexander\u2019s empire. In contrast, ancient Greece was full of city states and small kingdoms. Sometimes the relations between these states were very hostile. The cases where Greek\u2019s (Hellenes) fought against each other were countless\u2026 Have you ever heard the Peloponnesian War (Sparta and allies VS Athens and Allies)? Well, Macedonia was ally of Spartans (Lacedaemonians)\u2026 Peloponnesian War - Wikipedia States or kingdoms like: Crete (Minoan civilization), Cyprus, Rhodes (with the famous Colossus), Messenia, Laconia (Sparta is the city and Leonidas was a King there), Corinth, Achaia, Ithaca (Odysseus was a King of this island), Athens ( Pericles was an Athenian politician), Salamis (Ajax was a King of this island), Mycenae (Agamemnon was a Mycenean King), Phthia (Achilles was from), Epirus ( Alexander\u2019s mother was a princes to this Kingdom. Do i have to explain that Olympias is a Greek name too?), Thessaly, Thrace, Macedonia (Philippos and Alexandros were Kings of Macedonia). And many, many others\u2026 So, what made all of them Greeks? First of all, Greeks used to say that: \u201c\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b7 \u0388\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd \u03b2\u03ac\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\u201d= whoever is not greek is a barbarian\u2026 Greeks had many things in common. Origin, language and names, culture, customs and habits, religion and faith, history and mythology, arts, Holy places, oracles and temples, architecture, all of these are only some of them\u2026 Let\u2019s name the combination of these common factors\u2026hmmmmmmm\u2026ah bingo: Greek Civilization! The participation at the ancient Olympic Games was a right, an honour and a benefit, given/ reserved only to/ for Greeks (Hellanodikai). As is already known, Macedonians participated at this ritual as well, among with the other Greeks. King of Macedonia Alexander I, a great-grandfather of Philippe and Alexander the Great, participated at the games. Same thing with the memberships of Greek councils, the oracular statements etc. Macedonian names are Greek names. To someone who is Greek, or at least can speak Greek fluently, these names aren\u2019t just a letter combination. These names are having a specific and VERY obvious meaning\u2026 \u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (\u0386\u03bb\u03b5\u03be + \u0386\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2) : \u0391\u03bb\u03b5\u03be = to protect/ to defend. Other words: \u0391\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03af\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf = Bulletproof, \u0391\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf = lightning rod/ lightning conductor, \u0391\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03af\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf = Parachute. \u0386\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 = man / male. Alexandros = Protector from enemy men. \u03a6\u03af\u03bb\u03b9\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 (\u03a6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 + \u038a\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2): \u03a6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 = Friend, \u038a\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 = Horse. Friend of horse or horse whisperer. You can visit google translate and find it out easily. Arrian, Plutarch and Ptolemy (the General and ruler of Egypt), are the main sources of Alexander\u2019s the Great life. Alexander and Ptolemy (a Macedonian himself), quoted multiple times that they were Greeks and never denied that. You know the sources, start reading. Besides, they spread \u201cto the end of the world\u201d the Greek Civilization. Not the Macedonian, neither the Spartan or the Myceanean. Their civilization was the following one: the Greek! The language was unique too: The Greek language. The same for all of them. Now, imagine a communication between Greek strangers somewhere in\u2026Greece. Its easy for them to conclude that they are from the same country (mostly because they speaking the same language fluently in the same country). It\u2019s very-very obvious that they are all Greeks! So if one of them ask: \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d, an answer like \u201cI\u2019m from Greece, what about you?\u201d, would be a very-very silly think to say\u2026 I don\u2019t know what are you doing in your country, but in mine if a compatriot ask this, my answer has to be my city, island or whatever. So Philippe or Alexander were Greeks (you can tell, only by hearing their names\u2026) but this is very obvious and a very limited intel. They were Kings of Greece? No. Neither Leonidas (King of Sparta) , Agamemnon (King of Mycenae), Odysseas (King of Ithaka), or Minos (King of Crete) were Kings of hole Greece\u2026 Just like that. In addition, if you can read this,  congrats. That\u2019s because you are a Greek. So you don\u2019t have to worry if is written by Greeks or if is a message to them. This is from Greeks to Greeks. No-one else can handle with this. At least if you were an ancient barbarian! Be aware, there are plenty of these imprints in Macedonia and the former lands of the Hellenistic Empire of Alexander the Great (From Greece & Egypt and east to India). If you want to read them, start learning Greek\u2026 ",
