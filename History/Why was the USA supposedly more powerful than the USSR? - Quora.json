            "answer_text": "While both sides of the cold war \u2018controlled\u2019 half of Europe, the American side were far more willing satellites. Western Europe never had to erect walls, mine fields and machine gun towers to stop it's inhabitants from leaving for the east. They enjoyed much higher levels of personal and political autonomy than eastern bloc countries, many of whom considered themselves reoccupied rather than liberated by the USSR after WW2, typified by the armed subjugation of Czechoslovakia after the Prague Spring. Having true allies rather than vassal states made the USA more powerful. ",

            "answer_text": "The US can project military power to anywhere on the globe with or without allied help. A recent example is the war in Iraq that undid Saddam Hussein and his government. Likewise the war in Afghanistan that toppled the Taliban from power there. Likewise the operation to kill Osama Bin laden. It\u2019s expensive. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s unpopular. Controlling the territory afterward has proved very difficult. But if you are enough of a PITA to the leaders of the USA they can put a giant crater where you are standing and whoever is your second in command knows he is next. No other nation can do that. Certainly not Russia. Russia has to send a tugboat out with its aircraft carrier for when it breaks down\u2026 because they know it will. When Russia needs someone dead they have to send spies out on scheduled airline flights and hope they get a chance to throw some poison them. ",
