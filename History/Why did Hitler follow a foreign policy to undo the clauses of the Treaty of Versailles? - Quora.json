            "answer_text": "The Treaty of Versailles was the treaty that never should have been. Its dictates were of the 19th Century and the terms of it came back to haunt its originators. No War reparations should have been demanded (because ALL of Europe was responsible for WW I via the chain of alliances), The League of Nations should have been backed up with authority and rebuilding should have been top priority. Alsace Lorraine was French. Poland should have been recreated but league of Nation plebiscites should have been held in ethnic conclaves. The A-H Empire needed to be broken up but Austria and Hungary should have been the only formed nations. Plebiscites should have been held there too. Note: If the USA had shored up its banking system in the 1920\u2019s, The Great Depression might have only been a recession and without the economic ruin that hit Europe, WW II might have been avoided.
