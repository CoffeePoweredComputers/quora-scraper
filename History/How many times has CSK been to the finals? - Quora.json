            "answer_text": "CSK will be playing in final for 8th time in IPL 2019. CSK has got 3 titles in its 7 outings in the finals of IPL. 2008 - CSK entered the finals in the first edition of IPL, but missed the title in a match which went down to the last ball. Rajasthan Royals (RR) won the tournament. 2009 - CSK finished second in the points table. 2010 - CSK lifts the cup and won their first title against Mumbai Indians (MI). 2011 - Again the defending champions, CSK defended the title against RCB by 58 runs. 2012 - This time, the defending champions again gave a royal entry into the finals against KKR. Though CSK gave a huge target of 191, KKR fearlessly won the title. If CSK would have won this year too, it would have become a hat-trick for the Yellow Army. A record which would be the most difficult one to be broken by any other team. 2013 - Again CSK continued to be dominant and held their number-one position on the points table and met Mumbai Indians in the finals for the second time, where MI won their first title. 2014 - CSK finished third in the points table. 2015 - This time Mumbai Indians defeated CSK for second time in the finals in which CSK failed to chase a target of 203. 2016 & 2017 - CSK (and RR) were under suspension as their respective owners were involved in betting case. 2018 - A year in which IPL fans witnessed the Roar of the Lions, Return of the Kings. A feast for the CSK fans out there. A real comeback for the real champions of IPL history. CSK won their third title against Sunrisers Hyderabad. 2019 - The defending champions CSK entered the finals by defeating Delhi Capitals in Qualifier 2. The most successful team CSK will face another most successful team MI in the finals for the 4th time. Both the teams, CSK and MI have won the title for 3 times.  CSK Aag hai Aag, aur dhushman (MI) petrol.. dhushman jitne zyadha badengi (2 league matches and Qualifier 1), Aag utni zyada fehaley gi\u2026  Dhag Dhag, Dhag Dhag, Dhag Dhag\u2026 PS :- Apart from being suspended for 2 years in 12 editions of IPL, CSK entered finals 8 times in 10 years.

            "answer_text": "Till now CSK have reached 7 times in IPL in 9 season which makes the only team to reach 7 times in IPL final. This shows their consistency level in IPL . But out of 6 IPL finals till now (current one is 7th) they could only won 2 trophies. So their conversion from league stage to final is best but their conversion from IPl Final to lifting the trophy is poor . Hope so they can this time win this trophy so that they can hold a record of clinching the trophy 3 times that too in 9 season which would beat the record of Mumbai Indians of clinching 3 trophies in 10 season.
