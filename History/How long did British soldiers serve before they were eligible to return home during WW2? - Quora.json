            "answer_text": "\u2018For the duration\u2019 That was the shorthand way of saying \u2018your service will last for as long as the war lasts\u2019. Which was the experience of pretty much all of the soldiers in the British Army of WW2. The earliest that they were \u2018eligible to return home\u2019 was once the enemy was defeated. For example, my Grandfather signed up in the reserves when it became pretty clear that something was brewing, was called up in 1939, fought in the Battle of France (1939\u201340), and, after a short period in the UK, was shipped out to India and Burma and remained there for the rest of the war, fighting the Japanese. He was then stationed in Germany after the war as part of the occupying forces. The conditions set for service were relatively harsh. As the wiki on WW2 conscription notes: \u201cPeople called up before they were 51 years old but who reached their 51st birthday during their service were liable to serve until the end of the war\u201d. So it was possible for someone to be serving as a line infantryman in their mid-50s. At the end of the war, demobilisation was gradual, with men being released from army service in dribs and drabs, rather than all at once. Many men were not released until a couple of years after the war ended, and conscription in the UK (National Service) lasted until 1960. The were were other services such as the Royal Navy that had large numbers of HOS personnel (\u2018HOStilities only\u2019, meaning, again, \u2018for as long as the war lasts\u2019) ",

            "answer_text": "I am no expert on this but I suspect that there was no system of leave taking in WWII as there had been on the western front in WWI. Geography may be one of the reasons. Doubtless more knowledgeable people will give a more definitive answer but I can only go on my father\u2019s experience. He landed in north Africa with operation Torch in 1942 and didn\u2019t come home again until after the end of the war in Europe in 1945. Had the war against Japan not been ended as abruptly as it was he would presumably have been sent from Europe to the far east after VE Day though I would guess not without some home leave. ",
