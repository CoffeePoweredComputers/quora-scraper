            "answer_text": "Because it\u2019s awesome? :) It\u2019s a very beautiful county, with amazing history. Theater, Science, Logic, Politics. Yes, every country has a history and traditions, but not many had such amazing impact in the world through the ages such as Greece, India, China, Italy, England, Germany, Japan, etc.  More recently, it also has come to the center of attention for sad reasons too. The refugee and financial crisis which both happened pretty much simultaneously. An indebted, bankrupt country barely managing to make ends meet, and its citizens in the borders having to deal with one of the largest refugee and illegal immigrant influxes Europe has seen since decades.  They have so far treated both situations gracefully, with humanity , ingenuity, and pride, a shining example of how people who can barely survive financially, can care and support a fellow human in need. Let\u2019s hope there will not be a major shift there. Situations like this bring pressure to small societies and lots of tension. Last but not least, Tourism is huge in Greece. Definitely one of the best destinations in the world. The cleanest river of Europe flows in northern Greece. Voidomatis.  Underneath the world renowned home of gods Olympus the tallest mountain in Greece and home of a beautiful forest, an amazing beach stretches for miles. The best of both worlds in just 15 minutes distance.  Talking about the sea, Greece also has the most \u201cBlue Flags\u201d awarded to them, which is an EU certification for pristine beaches and seas.  Greek food, a combination of eastern and western cuisine is amazing.  So many people visit and so many leave with great impressions, repeat visits, and wonderful memories that last for a lifetime. All these, make Greece so famous. ",
