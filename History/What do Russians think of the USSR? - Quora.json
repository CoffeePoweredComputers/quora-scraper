            "answer_text": "Generally people have mixed feelings, also there are some USSR-lovers and haters. USSR was a kind of an adult kindergarten for its citizens. People didn't have much independence, they couldn't have valuable possessions and master their lives in the way they would want. But on the other side, the state would always give people jobs and a place to live, regardless of what they did. Such circumstances had created a very naive society, with very simple and straightforward relationships between people. And when the Real World had broke in, and people finally had to become adults, some people were welcoming it, and some felt nostalgia for the old days. Human memory works in strange ways. Usually people remember only bits of their past. Each person then collects these bits into a maze that fits their experience and views best. So today people can have completely different pictures of the USSR in their heads and hearts, sometimes arguing for hours. Here are the main bits for both sides. USSR-lovers- In USSR, everyone got a job and a place to live. Now many people are jobless, and you have to buy apartments yourself.- USSR was one of the world's leading countries, everyone was respecting it. It had a cool army and lots of influence in different parts of the world. Today's Russia is a 3-rd world country.- USSR had won the war, launched man into space and had many other achievements in science. USSR-haters- In USSR, people were limited in what they could do. They couldn't travel abroad, couldn't start their own business. It was hard to choose a city and a place to live -- usually the state would give only few options. There was no respect for individuality and person's rights.- Most people had very modest life level. Often even the simplest goods were hard to find in shops (like toilet paper or nice shoes). The free flats were small, lots of people had to lived in rooms in communal flats.- The ideology brainwashing levels were overwhelming, and each book or article, even scientific ones, was verified on matching the right ideology. There was no free speech, no real history and philosophy, all the art was in the shade of Marxism-Leninism. So, people who have a sentiment towards the state and military force, those who have the need for national pride tend to like USSR, forgiving or forgetting all the problems it had. On the contrary, people with more individualistic characters usually blame USSR for mediocracy and for little or no opportunities to be on your own, and hate it. Also, there are lots of people somewhere in between, who have mixed feelings. UPD: a good video illustration for the subject.  ",

            "answer_text": "They feel different. Some people is nostalgic about it. Some hate it, so they pretty happy now,  some don't give a shit about all this stuff and just lives their lives.  Personally me is quite rational about it.The USSR had both bright and dark sides. The bright side is an idea of forming a new kind of people - people which will be the people of \"to be\", but not \"to have\", the people which would have a passion for creative work and would do the creative work, not because they need to make money or acquire things, but just because they love it and having fun by doing this creative things. The keyword is \"creative\". The \"Founding Fathers\" of USSR, if I can put it this way, actually had a plan how to do this. For example, all physical, non-creative work must be eliminated and automated, so it would require no humans to do such work. The man should only does a creative things - writing a music, to be an explorer, to be a scientist, software developer and so on. This is require a new kind of person - the person which wants to be, instead of to have. I'd love to live in this kind of society. I'll explain why. See this:  This is a soviet space shuttle, called \"buran\". The main difference, that it was able to land completely automatically, without humans. The first flight was completely unmanned. The system had a genius design - all calculation was made with only 8 MHz microprocessor (UPDATE: just checked, it was actually 4 MHz, 128 Kb RAM, 4 of them for robustness. So it was zx spectrum, landing the machine unmanned from space). Currently, the programmer of this system have a job in online advertising business. So, currently, if there would be USSR, I would be program a scientific research tool or a space mission or something really useful instead of one more \"photosharingdatingwithtagsdeletingphotos\" shit. That a bright side of USSR The dark side of all this stuff is that the people are not ready yet. So they required to be forced to it. From this goes the dictatorship, thoughts control and whole '1984' thing. The other problem, that by creating a system which will perform a dictatorship, Lenin created a possibility for one, powerful enough, escape from the system, so the government did. Here goes a problem - the government declared a philosophy for citizens but not followed it. This is ruined everything and create just another dictatorship country where the small amount of people uses the others for personal good. So, the main flaw of USSR is that the dream requires a new kind of people and new kind of economy - where no more physical work required. And now they say, that in future 15-20 years the 40 percent of professions will be obsolete and eliminated by robots ant automation. What will happen then? The USSR had the answer, but have we? ",
