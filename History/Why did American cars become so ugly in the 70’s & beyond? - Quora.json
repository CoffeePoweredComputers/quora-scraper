            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy did American cars become so ugly in the 70\u2019s & beyond?\u201d While automotive design is a subjective thing \u2014 what\u2019s \u201cugly\u201d to one person may be beautiful to another \u2014 American vehicles from the later-1970s and at least into the 1980s are generally considered to be less aesthetically pleasing than, say, cars of the 1950s or 1960s. Some would say that design rebounded in the late 1990s or 2000s, as US automakers began to pay more attention to importance of appearance, as well. So, why did attractiveness wane in the 1970s/1980s? I\u2019d argue that it was due to money. Take GM\u2019s F-cars, the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird, for example. Both debuted new (shared) designs in early 1970, and the pair received rave reviews for their European-inspired styling. The Camaro\u2019s split-bumper RS package is still a delightful look that calls to mind some of the best of Ferrari\u2019s Pininfarina designs. Meanwhile, the Firebird\u2019s one-piece, sculpted Endura front end looked so fluid that it forever changed automotive styling, and the flexible fascias of nearly every vehicle today descends from it. So the pair started out on a high and were well regarded when they debuted. Then, in 1974, a funny thing happened: they both got ugly. In fairness, the Camaro got more ugly than the Firebird. What happened? Two things: skyrocketing oil prices and insurance industry lobbying. First, the OPEC nations started restricting oil shipments to the US, which caused gasoline shortages and prices soared at the pump. This caused US automakers to devote all their resources to improving the fuel economy of their already-in-the-pipeline vehicles and to engineer more fuel efficient powertrains for not-yet-released vehicles. There was a contributing factor of EPA emissions, too, which required the automakers to reduce tailpipe emissions, which required even more engineering to solve. Compression ratios were reduced, cylinder heads were redesigned to feature hardened exhaust valve seats to prevent erosion due to unleaded fuel, ignition systems were redesigned to get more spark energy, \u201celectronic\u201d carburetors were created to try to improve efficiency, nearly every automaker experimented with smaller, lighter, turbo-charged engines (though usually with mixed results). To be sure, some good came from the period, like the catalytic converter, which works wonders at reducing emissions output. And electronic ignition systems vastly improved performance, as well. Second, and perhaps more visibly noticeable, was the insurance industry\u2019s successful lobbying of the US Congress to require changes to vehicles to minimize how much damage they would sustain in low-speed collisions. The insurance industry (rightly) claimed that collisions at speeds less than 5 mph were causing significant damage that was becoming too costly to repair, which was hurting their profit margins \u2026 of course, they focused the discussion on the notion that such collisions were costing the average American too much to repair, but it was a thinly-veiled cover story for the fact that they were spending too much to repair cars for those Americans. So they pushed Congress to force automakers to design \u201csafer\u201d vehicles that would sustain minimal \u2014 if any \u2014 damage in sub-5 mph collisions. And thus was born the \u201cbig bumper\u201d era of automotive design.  (1970 Chevrolet Camaro Rally Sport Z/28. Note the slender, \u201csplit\u201d front bumpers.) The 1974 Camaro demonstrated this in spades (as did many of GM\u2019s 1973 mid- and full-size models), when the attractive, slender bumpers of yore were quickly discarded in favor of massive beams suspended by considerably-sized shock absorbers that cushioned and absorbed impacts and prevented the bodywork \u2014 fenders, grilles, headlights, taillights, etc. \u2014 from every coming into contact with obstacles in low-speed encounters. The big bumpers did work, but \u2014 for the most part \u2014 the designs were rushed to market with little thought given to how to make them more palatable to car buyers.  (1974 Chevrolet Camaro. Note the much larger bumper that protrudes much farther from the bodywork, to minimize body damage in a collision.) As a result, the automakers had to spend so much money on engineering to improve economy and emissions, that they had little left over to spend on less critical aspects of their products, like appearance. (Obviously, big automakers like GM technically had money available, but like any good business, they set budgets for the development of their products to ensure they remain profitable, so product teams shifted dollars from \u201cstyling\u201d to \u201cengineering\u201d to meet these challenges.) What\u2019s interesting is that styling doesn\u2019t necessarily need to add substantial cost to a project, if the challenge is approached creatively. And perhaps nowhere was this more evident than with the Camaro\u2019s sister-car, Pontiac\u2019s Firebird. Rather than follow Chevrolet\u2019s almost mindless adoption of big, ugly, exposed bumpers, Pontiac\u2019s stylists chose to conceal the massive, energy-absorbing bumper structures. Initially, they engineered their bumper to be more outwardly slender, but still with a significant structure behind to absorb impacts. And to minimize scuffing of bodywork or the bumper, they applied a black, rubber cover. While the black bumper was noticeable (though less so on black or dark-colored cars), it\u2019s more slender size and more organic look tended to be received better by the buying public, so while Camaro sales plummeted, Firebird sales actually increased.  (1970 Pontiac Firebird Formula 400. Note the one-piece, body-colored, rubber \u201cnose\u201d that blends in seamlessly with the body.)  (1974 Pontiac Firebird Formula. Note that the black bumper is actually a slender rubber cover intended to minimize the visibility of any scuffing that might result from a minor collision.) And within two years, Pontiac took the approach a step further and again used a flexible bumper cover as a means of achieving a previously impossible front end design that still minimized damage in a low-speed impact (often requiring only minor repainting of the bumper cover) and actually improved the car\u2019s appearance.  (1976 Pontiac Firebird Formula. By 1976, the bumper structure was entirely concealed beneath a very attractive bumper cover.) Other American automakers went through similar stylistic evolution. As the 1970s wore on and the engineering teams got a better handle on emissions and efficiency, more money became available again for styling, so designs improved. So, like so many issues, vehicle designs are often influenced \u2014 sometimes significantly \u2014 by the impact of external factors on pre-determined budgets. There\u2019s only so much money available, so when unexpected expenses are incurred, money (or time/effort) is trimmed from non-essential areas to compensate. In the case of the 1970s, this phenomena resulted in some pretty ugly cars. But it eventually gave rise to all-new and better approaches to automotive styling that live on to this day. ",

            "answer_text": "Safety requirements like 3 mph bumpers and crash test mandates. The move to lighter weight but not very pliable materials. The EPA mileage mandates. Design is expensive. New materials are expensive. New technology is expensive. It's an evolution. Each new car is often a succession of the base platform. For instance in 1979 Mustang had the Fox Platform. That platform was used for 14 years. A 93 Mustang is very refined to a 79. But the evolution goes only so far. Detroit had to develop new platforms one model at a time. It takes hundreds of millions to accomplish this. And you have to be profitable doing it. Go to wiki. Type in Crown Victoria or Chevrolet Impala or Corvette or F-Series. It will list the evolution of each generation of cars with a summary of changes. Good info if you are a \"car guy\". ",
