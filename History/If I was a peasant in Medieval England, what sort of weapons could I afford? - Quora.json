            "answer_text": "That highly depended on what job you had. Not all peasants were poor. Some were richer than some nobles. Not all peasants did farm work, either. Some were servants in castles or big houses. Some went on to work in the cities. Some became soldiers. The soldiers would have average, standard weapons you\u2019d expect from a common soldier. A farmer wouldn\u2019t likely be able to afford anything fancy, but the truth is they didn\u2019t need them.  That scythe, the sheathed knife hanging from his belt. These are useful tools, but also excellent for self defense in a pinch. This guy would likely carry that knife around even when having a leisurely walk. If he went into a crowded marketplace, he\u2019d definitely carry that on his person. It was like carrying a pistol in a holster while in the Southeast of USA, except probably even more prevalent. If some nasty person wanted a fight, he risked getting hurt real badly. Most people owned knives, by the way. Most children used them too.  Check out those other tools. They\u2019re so useful \u2026 yet so deadly. Plenty of other things could be used as weapons too. Laces for choking. Needles for stabbing the eyes. And just about anything heavy and blunt can knock someone out. ",
