            "answer_text": " My answer will not consist in his crucial role, in WWI or WW2. I will love to answer on his \u201cless known\u201d, legacy to the World, which to my humble opinion is equally important and genial. I will not try to see him on my answer as the \u201cGreat Leader leading Great Britain to Victory\u201d, but to Sir Winston as a writer, philosopher and a man ahead of his time, connecting him with simple quotes, to what the World is experiencing today: \u2022 His concept on democracy. What you think about this ?  \u2022 Was he a \u201ctime resistant\u201d pragmatist? Well you can judge:  \u2022 He knew a lot about war, and we all know it, but what was his thought on politics? Was he right?  \u2022 He failed and succeeded so many times in his public and personal life. I just want your opinion on his opinion about \u201cfailure and success:  \u2022 If you are feeling pessimistic about this answer and what could Churchill say about that, well he had the perfect answer:  \u2022 His conception of the spoken and unspoken words a lifetime ago. To me they are great, I don\u2019t know what you think :  \u2022 Here is what he thought about courage in human morality and\u2026 courage of course:  \u2022 What he thought of America and Americans ? Well, he saw WWI and WW2 and what he had to say about that, after being \u201chalf American\u201d himself:  \u2022 If you disliked and didn\u2019t approve Sir Winston\u2019s quotes, added here after a long selection ( did I mention his Nobel price on Literature on 1953? ), and all this quotes are not relevant and contemporary, well he has a Quote for that occasion, when you can add your comments or dislikes, based on this:  I hope you enjoyed folks, the \u201cPhilosopher inside a Warrior\u201d!
