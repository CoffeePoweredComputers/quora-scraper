            "answer_text": "Brown to yellowish smooth skin, dark oblique eyes and dark brown to jet black hair, but little to no facial hair. Occasional stocky physique. Mexicans today who have lots of facial hair usually have heavy Iberian (Span. & Port.) ancestry. Northern Mexican Indians greatly resemble the Southwest tribes of the United States. This makes sense as they\u2019re geographically next to each other. Consider that traditional Kumeyaay people live in both San Diego County in California and Mexico\u2019s northern Baja California. Apache, Pima, and Tohono O\u2019odham homelands also include parts of the vast expanse of desert where the US and Mexico meet.  The image above is of a Tarahumara (taruh-OO-mah-ruh) man from Chihuahua bordering New Mexico and Texas. His tribe, renowned for running incredible distances, are directly related to the Ute, Comanche, and Shoshone tribes of the US, as well as the historic Aztecs of Mexico City. Essentially, the man above with the headband and fiddle has direct blood ties to peoples who once lived in tepees and wickiups and hunted buffalo and people who built floating chinampa gardens on Lake Texcoco. They are all of the Uto-Aztecan family.   \u2014Navajo man from early 20th cent. Arizona  \u2014Modern Navajo man in Monument Valley, Utah   \u2014Maya villagers sharing a meal The southerners of Mexico before Hispanic contact tended to have the classic Mayan look, most notable in that striking nose ridge. The pronounced nose is a evolutionary result of living in such humid, dense rain forests.  \u2014a young Lacand\u00f3n Maya from Chiapas   See? Very same nose.  \u2014Pan American Unity, a massive mural in San Francisco by Diego Rivera, 1940   \u2014Olmec baby from Las Bocas in Puebla. Notice the narrow eyes.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Today and then\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- It\u2019s remarkable that these people have managed to maintain this distinct phenotype, especially in today\u2019s small world. The man above is a Maya and next to him is another Olmec statue; the ancient Olmecs are believed to be the predecessors of the Mayas. Thanks for reading, friend! ",

            "answer_text": "This is a tricky question because: 500 years ago Mexicans didn\u2019t exist! Mexicans are the result of the mix between natives and Spaniards (mostly), but also Portuguese, Blacks, Asians, etc. Try to answer the following question: What did the children look like before been conceived? Impossible to answer, right? So, in this example, natives (Aztecs, Mayans, etc.) and Spaniards (mostly) are the parents of the Mexicans children. So, a most accurate question will be: What did natives look like 500 years ago before mixing with the Spaniards? For this one, Santana Arango\u00b4s answer is an excellent one. ",
