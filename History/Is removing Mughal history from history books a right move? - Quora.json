            "answer_text": "Mughal are covered in great detail in Indian school textbooks. But the logic behind this is not very hard to find for anyone. Mughal ruled over a large swatches of Indian subcontinent, produced great rulers, left behind architectural structures and significant amount of literature to ensure its imprint in Indian subcontinent. Thus it would be very hard for us to forget them. But the educational bodies across India seem to be making a conscious effort to remove such a significant part of Indian history so that future generation would not be taught about the Mughal. The new textbooks keeps it focal point on great Maratha empires established by Chhatrapati Shivaji. But where the extra chapters come? This will come at the cost of chapters hitherto dedicated to Mughal emperor. But with whom the Maratha emperors fought? With the Mughal. But it will not be present in new textbooks. The students will not learn that: Who built the Taj Mahal? How many years have taken to complete Taj Mahal? How much money was needed to made Taj Mahal? This would not be there. Let's take another example: The Red Fort. Again who built, money needed, workers engaged. The Maratha Emperors were also great. But the sultans of Delhi who came and ruled India would not be there in new history. Muhammad bin Tughluq's various eccentric decisions such as shifting the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad (in present-day Maharashtra), changing currencies. Though it was inspired by Chinese who replaced the old currencies with paper currencies. So Muhammad bin Tughlaq made copper currencies overnight by third rated smiths and changed it. Prior to this the gold and silver coin had it's value with gold or silver present in it. But the new coins were easily duplicated. But he was not as crazy as you think. He was a great scholar in Mathematics, astrology and physics. Especially there was nobody to match him in Calligraphy. Like other great kings, he was an excellent warrior. But where will be this with in history text books? Another example is: How Sher Shah Suri ascended the throne when the Mughal emperor Nasir-ud-Din Mu\u1e25ammad better known as Humayun was on an expedition on 17 May 1538. And some of his benevolent measures.  A brilliant strategist, Sher Shah proved himself as a gifted administrator as well as a capable general. His reorganization of the empire laid the foundations for the later Mughal emperors, notably Akbar, son of Humayun. Another great Mughal Emperor Akbar the great (though this suffix the great have been removed in Rajasthan) who ensure freedom, equality, toleration, fraternity, justice. This had prevailed under the reign of Akbar.  Akbar in his Court History is written by the victors, they say. Now that might be true enough. But no one said anything about rewriting history, did they?
