            "answer_text": "As soon as this question appeared in my Quora feed, I became excited as 1999 Kargil war (operation Vijay from Indian side) was the finest mountain warfare by Indian Army which once again made world to witness, the most professional army fighting in mountainous terrain and achieving victory. Kindly note, in mountain warfare, soldier sitting on top has the highest advantage over attacking troop, and mountain warfare is not less than nightmare for any army. That is evident from the fact that Britishers captured most of the part of India but did not dare to go beyond Himalayans.  First you need to understand the background of Kargil war. 1971 Liberation of Bangladesh - considered as the black day in history - Pakistan Army after this takes oath to divide in India into pieces. ( this claim is based on the account of casual interaction with Pakistani Officers on UN peacekeeping missions ).1984 - Operation Meghdoot - Pakistan losing Siachen Glacier. It was final nail in coffin by Indian Army securing Kashmir.Pakistan Military Historians states that in 1987, a proposal was made by then Brigadier Parvez Mushraff who was also brigade commander of Siachen Brigade and special forces; for launching offensive in Ladakh and across line of control to capture the posts in winters. General Zia, rejected the proposal by saying that this will lead to conventional warfare and Pakistan\u2019s fate would be sealed. After 1971, all political leaders did not wish to explore adventure of conventional war with India as it weakens their image in front of their own citizens. Though Zia agreed for low conflict intensity operation across line of control which gave birth to Pakistan sponsored terrorism in Kashmir (earlier they tried in Punjab and failed) in 1989.Pakistan wanted to do the same thing what India did in 1984. Tactical capturing of land by Hooke or crook.Terms of Reference. The following are the theatre level terms of reference laid down by Pakistani Army commanders who were the mastermind of Kargil Conflict. Around 20 posts to be captured on Indian Side during winters.This task will be carried out by irregulars of Pakistani Army under command of regular Pakistani Army Officer. ( refer citation being read out in official ceremony of Pakistani Army in the following video which backs my terms of reference number 2) 3. The intruders would be self sustained by carrying 4 to 6 months of ration, ammunition, hygiene and chemical, clothing and ordinance items. 4. They will be wearing regional cloths and not combat uniforms to deceive attention of International Media. 5. When ice will melt in summers, and Indian Army will come back to occupy the posts, they will offer resistance to India. By then logistical support would be established. Assumptions made. Following assumptions were also made by Pakistani Strategists. Indian Army will not retaliate with full force perceiving conventional threat by Pakistan from western front.They will not accept in front of International Media about the captured post to safeguard their image in front of their media and international media.As Line of Control can be changed unlike International border, this act of Pakistan will help to change demography of Line of Control which will boost up Pakistani Citizens over Kashmir issue.Pakistani Army commanders assumed that, if concentration of force increases in Kargil, then they will get sanction from Pakistani Government to launch conventional war from western front. They also assumed that Chinese army as an ally will also open up the eastern front to put pressure on Indian Army. (Indians had used same tactics in 1965 war by opening western front they deceived Pakistani offensive in Kashmir)Both the countries are nuclear power, therefore, India will not go for conventional warfare.If conventional warfare situation builds up then International players will come into play and a ceasefire will be declared which will give Pakistan an advantage to bring India on table to discuss Kashmir issue and demography of Ceasefire line will get changed. (exactly which happened in 1999).Aim: To capture Indian Vacated post on line of control. Mission: Irregulars will capture Indian Vacated Posts during winters and they will hold the ground till the time summer arrives allowing Pakistani Army to establish logistic supply line. So what happened? When Pakistani Soldiers started capturing vacant posts, they found that there were posts lying vacant till miles and it gave Pakistani Army an aim plus. aim plus: To capture all the vacant Indian posts. This allowed Pakistani Army to restructure their strategy. Now, they were focusing to cutdown National Highway 1A which was connecting Ladakh and Kashmir with rest of India. Cutting down this communication line meant, India would get isolated in Siachen and Ladakh. They also launched offensive in Southern Glacier and Central Glacier of Siachen. Pakistan started heavy artillery shelling in northern glacier. They also targeted ammunition dump, assembly areas of Indian Army with heavy shelling across national highway 1A.  The self sustained troops were delighted with this kind of easy victory and they achieved aim plus. As per my knowledge Pakistan captured 125 posts where as various international Journalists reported that 130 posts were captured. (refer Kargil War) Now it is time to answer Your question after understanding the background. Till April 1999, Prime Minster Nawaz Shariff was not aware about the Kargil Act. During various military briefings, the army commanders showed the military map on which Line of Control wasn\u2019t drawn. Mr. Nawaz had no knowledge of military maps, and he was told about the location of Jihadis over the map who will fight as terrorists. Nawaz Shariff made a mistake of not asking questions or taking interests in the military briefing.After one of the briefings, when Nawaz were heading back to Islamabad, a Brigadier on the way asked him, \u2018\u2019do you know, what is happening\u2019\u2019. This was enlightenment for the prime minister who realised he was backstabbed by military generals. By this time, India had already made the claim about Pakistan\u2019s intrusion in its own territory, and India had started initial operation of Kargil. The incident which I am narrating is the one after the military briefing given to Prime Minister which was organised strictly to assess the claims made by India. The briefing was once again misleading and tactful and least interest Nawaz Shariff who had little knowledge of military operation was deceived. Nawaz Shariff did inquire about this to Army Chief then General Mushraf and Mushraf clearly told him that they had briefed the same thing, but the prime minister failed to understand probably. (refer Pakistani journalist Najam Sethi Interview. Video shared in the end of blog post)Failure of Assumption Number 1. Indian Army concentrated 7 lakhs soldiers in Kashmir valley which was a shocker for Pakistan Army. They did not anticipate this. But Pakistan Generals had a plan B of opening up the western front (in case India commit the mistake of concentrating large number of troops). Indians had also moved their modern artillery to this region.Failure of Assumption Number 2. Pakistan did seek support from china. China condemn the act of Pakistan and for the first time, china denied a direct support to Pakistan. (before this Pakistan had seek help from China in 1965, 1971 and 1984 and China promised that they will provide military aid. Interestingly, the aid in form of troops or opening up a front against India was never given)Failure of Assumption Number 3. Pakistani Government did not agree for conventional warfare on western front. Nawaz Shariff feared a similar result like 1971, which might had taken him to the fate what Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto had. Nawaz Shariff approached Bill Clinton to mediate and ask for ceasefire.Failure of Assumption Number 4. Pakistani Army assumed that International pressure on India will lead to ceasefire just like 1948. This will allow them to redraw the line of control and Pakistan will gain victory in terms of captured land.The major mistake made was Assumption number 3. Pakistani Government did not agree for conventional war with India as suggested by General Parvez Mushraf. This was the turning point on theatre level. Therefore, answer to your question is that Pakistani Army did think of a conventional war with India but they did not countercheck and liasioned with their allies to convert their assumptions into reality. There was no coordination between Pakistan Army with the government. India was not ready for ceasefire and Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee clearly stated that they are even ready for nuclear war which sent shock waves in Pakistan. The military leadership on Indian side displayed highest standards where the military leaders anticipated, calculated and implemented the strategy considering geopolitical scenarios. Indian Military Leadership also kept a good coordination with the governments. The foreign ministry and ambassadors to various nation of India, also created an atmosphere which isolated Pakistan on international level. Personal Opinion on Kargil Conflict. As a military scholar, I will describe my personal opinion as follows. The Pakistani military strategy of deception has to be a case study. They deceived even their government. (the later part I have used for humour)Pakistan would had made substantial gains, if they had taken their own government in confidence.Indian Army fought the most difficult wars of all time. Fighting in mountains isn\u2019t easy. Indian battle concept was of numerical superiority. They used strategy of 1:40 (to kill 1 Pakistani soldier they used 40 Indian Soldiers), they also softened the target by use of Artillery in mountains. Pakistan Never thought that Indians will bring artillery at such heights. It demonstrates the highest tactical mind of military leaders of India, determination of sub-unit commanders and courage of troops.In the world, if any army can win a war in mountainous region, then it has to be Indian Army.Source of Answer: read: When Pakistan and India went to war over Kashmir in 1999 refer: Kargil: The Impregnable Conquered by Lieutenant General YM BAMM refer: Pakistani Senior Journalist Najam Sethi interview    ",

            "answer_text": "Why did the Pakistani generals who planned the 1999 Kargil incursion believe that India would not retaliate massively? (Paraphrase) (Indian MiG-21 used in the 1999 war, on display)  (Rock mountains, Kargil, India)  (Photo Credits: Dreamstime.com) Pakistan has historically, at least until the 1971 war, chosen to believe that their military elan was superior to India and that their strength and resolve was not something India could overcome. They had the same military background as India and are both from the same 5000-year-old civilization. Independence in 1947 divided the two nations along religious lines, and intermittent conflict has flared ever since. Four wars have been fought between the neighbors (1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999) along with a massive standoff in 2001, where well over half a million Indian and Pakistani troops confronted each other across the international border. The 1971 war saw a catastrophic defeat for Pakistan, as India held off Pakistan on the western border, and defeated Pakistani forces in the east, creating the new nation of Bangladesh from what was formerly East Pakistan. Pakistani naval and air forces were also outmatched and largely outgunned in the conflict, although not as badly as the land forces in the eastern sector were. Pakistani confidence in its inherent martial superiority over India was badly shaken. Since the 1971 war a major land, sea, and air war across the international border have not taken place. This 48 year period of relative calm had a lot to do with the traumatic defeat Pakistan suffered in 1971. Belief in a victory over India in a force on force battle was not seen as a credible doctrine any longer. This was the backdrop the 1999 Kargil attack took place in. Per open sources, General Pervez Musharraf was the key architect of the Kargil operation. The Kargil operation was designed to win a victory for Pakistan without confronting India in an all-out war, which Pakistan now knew they could no longer win. Pakistan planned an attack across disputed territory rather than the international border. This allowed them to cite a justifiable reason for the attack. Secondly, Pakistan used its intelligence on Indian troop rotations to their advantage. Indian forces usually vacated their posts in the sector during the coldest months and returned when the weather was warmer. Pakistan took full advantage of India\u2019s complacency and carelessness to move in during this period. When Indian forces returned Pakistan had dug in thousands of troops in heavily camouflaged and fortified positions. Thirdly Pakistan used its Northern Light Infantry (NLI) to man the positions. When the attack was discovered they hoped to claim that the forces the Indians were fighting were local mujahideen fighters. The NLI were best suited for the role. The biggest trump card, as Pakistan saw it, was that Indian forces upon their return to the vacated posts would find the position fortified and strongly held with Pakistani forces in an advantageous position. This was designed to discourage Indian forces from even considering an attack, as victory could not be certain, the cost would be high, and international mediation would foreclose the issue in Pakistan\u2019s favor before India could widen the war and bring up more powerful forces. In short, Pakistan believed that if they presented a fait accompli to India they could wrest control of Kargil from the Indians without a fight. Unfortunately for Pakistan, their modelling was incorrect in several critical areas. Pakistani intelligence was quite accurate on Indian deployment patterns in the area. Pakistan also tried to minimize widening the war by attacking in a disputed area, and they were successful in their calculations as India did not broaden the conflict to include attacks outside of the Kargil battlezone. However, Pakistan failed to anticipate how strongly the Indians would react. There was no offer of talks or compromise and India promptly set about planning on how to oust Pakistani forces. India rapidly assembled a force of over 30,000 men, much larger than what Pakistan seemed to have prepared for. These forces attacked across areas that were very unfavorable for them and took heavy casualties, including several officers who led from the front. The Pakistanis could not counter such a large force in the region with the 5000 men they had assembled. Indian artillery used Russian Krasnopol laser-guided artillery shells to good effect, and the IAF was able to fly precision sorties with its Mirage fleet. This was not anticipated by Pakistan, as no strikes had previously been conducted at such high altitudes and India had to invent procedures to effectively deliver precision munitions at such tropospheric altitudes. The relentless Indian advances, artillery strikes with precision munitions, and air superiority over the battlefield along with effective close air support from the Mirages led to Indian victories across multiple segments of the battlezone, such as the Dras and Batilik sectors. Pakistan found itself diplomatically isolated as most nations refused to believe Pakistani claims that the forces dug in at Kargil were mere local mujahideen. These combinations of factors led Pakistan to withdraw its forces from its few remaining positions. Pakistani strategic assumptions and planning based on it had proven to be incorrect, and India had secured a comprehensive victory in the operation. It is always dangerous to assume that a potential opponent is inept, weak, and inferior to one's own forces in courage and martial prowess. In the two decades since the Kargil war Pakistan seemed to have taken this factor into its operational planning. Minor clashes still occur, but a major war and even covert actions on the scale of the Kargil operation seem to be considered as undesirable options to engage in. We can all hope it stays that way between the two uneasy nuclear-armed neighbors. ",
