            "answer_text": "That is a very interesting question. The French possessed more of the land of North America laying below Canada and than Britain for quite awhile, and some in Canada. A good deal of land between the Mississippi and the 13 British colonies south of Canada was French territory. They lost that land to Britain in what we call the French and Indian War (1754\u201363), which was part of a much longer global war between the French and British to determine supremacy. In 1763, most of this French territory was transferred to Great Britain. But the French still possessed lands west of the Mississippi, from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian border and from the Mississippi River as far west as Idaho. This is why we have cities with names like Eau Claire, WI, Pierre, SD, Sault Saint Marie, MI, LaSalle, IL, St. Louis, MO, Bay St. Louis, MS, Mobile, AL, and of course New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1803, Napoleon offered to sell the French holdings below Canada, 828,000 square miles of land, to the U.S. for around $16 million. President Jefferson leapt at it. All this is to show that there is a good basis for speculating about your question. The 13 Atlantic colonies that became the United States were settled by many British who came as permanent settlers intent on building new towns, cities, and farms. Some came hoping for wealth. Some to worship as they saw fit. Some to escape bill collectors or sheriffs. Some were criminals shipped out by Great Britain. Some were Irish and Scots-Irish who had their lands seized and given to supporters of kings or, for awhile, a Puritan dictator. There was no Germany yet, but immigrants from small Germanic states came to some British colonies as permanent settlers. There were French Protestants persecuted by the French government. The English inherited some Dutch settlers in New York land deals. And so on. The British colonies began building proper cities with government and major private buildings of stone and brick, often in Georgian style. They shipped American produce to England and English products were shipped back to merchants. The French did a bit of that, particularly in the part of Canada they held, New Orleans at the end of the Mississippi River, and Mobile a bit to the east. But in almost all their vast holdings the French were living off the land. Mainly trapping animals for their fur or feathers. They had settlements where they would go to ship pelts back to France and buy supplies. They usually made alliances rather than war with American Indian nations and tribes and often married American Indian women. So had the French gotten to the Atlantic Seaboard first, where big rivers that drained a large territory into bays off the Atlantic, French colonial ports would likely have developed. But the French demonstrated a pronounced lack of interest in developing the New World, in part because the staunchly Catholic France had no interest in providing safe places where religious dissenters could build their own worlds. England, on the other hand, was a nation of dissenters. The Europeanization of America would have been a lot slower. Who knows how the French-British confrontations in North America would have turned out? But the conditions for producing anything remotely like the United States as we know it would not have existed if it had been 13 French colonies. ",

            "answer_text": "France would still own the thirteen colonies, because the colonists, being French, would be too afraid to rebel. Kidding aside, the French executed one of the most brutal revolutions known to man at the same time America was signing its Constitution into place. France had similar tyranny issues as Britain, but overthrew internally where America just cut the ropes. France did own the Louisiana Purchase, a chunk of land comparable in size to the colonies. ",
