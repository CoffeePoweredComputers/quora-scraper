            "answer_text": "East Boston you mean. This small neighborhood is right next to Logan Airport. When I lived there, our place was on the landing approach (one of them anyway). Planes started coming in just a hundred feet or so above the roof at 4:30 a.m. That went on every 20 minutes until 1 a.m. the next day. It was impossible to watch TV, and important conversations got interrupted all the time. East Boston is just a little above sea level. ",
