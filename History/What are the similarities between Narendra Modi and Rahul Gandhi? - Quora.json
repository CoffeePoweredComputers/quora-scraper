            "answer_text": "5 Major Similarities in them: Both know a very little of Indian Economic and How it works. Don't even bother about asking them with regards to questions on GDP, Banking Structure and others.They hire anyone to do their bidding. It is clear that both Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi doesn't think twice before positioning people for important roles. The selection of Nirmala Sitaraman, Uma Bharti or any other non-independent ministers is questionable. Similarly, in Congress - complete CWC is a joke in terms of the work order.Both of them wants to mark themselves by presenting major schemes first before even thinking twice about implementation.They don't think about middle-class people. Earlier in the UPA era, Rahul Gandhi was focused on BPL category voters more and similar to this Narendra Modi is still focused on BPL and Rural Vote Bank. Their policies are laughing slap to middle-class public.Last but important point - While BJP shouts that Congress is lead by a family and people revolve around it. Narendra Modi made BJP revolve around himself in the exact same manner. The only difference is that one party will have bloodline successors while others will have Pre-Crowned Successors or similar to what ur Monks Do - Narendra Modi will crown someone successor himself which while not from the bloodline but will definitely belong to the formal ideology of NAMO.",
