            "answer_text": "Nuclear Excision Repair (NER) is a pre-replication damage repair process of DNA. This process is executed by four proteins in E. coli namely Uvr A, Uvr B, Uvr C and Uvr D. In most cases the strand of DNA is damaged by formation of abnormal intracellular thymine - thymine dimer due to UV light irradiation. A complex of Uvr A and Uvr B scans the DNA with Uvr A being responsible for detecting distortions in the DNA helix due to the formation of the abnormal thymine thymine dimer. Uvr A then exits the complex and Uvr B then melts the DNA to create a single stranded bubble around the lesion.  Hope this helps. ",
