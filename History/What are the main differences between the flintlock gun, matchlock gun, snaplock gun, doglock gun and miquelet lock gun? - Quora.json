            "answer_text": "No one has yet attempted an answer to your question which in some ways is no surprise as there are very few who understand the evolution of these early weapons and areas of disagreement among those who do. Your question covers the various types of lock that might have appeared on a firearm from the earliest days up to the introduction of percussion systems so first lets break it down. \u201cWhat\u2019s the main differences between the flintlock gun (and) matchlock gun\u201d You have identified two of the three main types of ignition, the third is the wheel-lock. \u201csnaplock gun, doglock gun and miquelet lock gun\u201d Which are all types of flintlock except the snaplock which actually implies any lock powered by a spring (except the wheel-lock). So: Matchlock The earliest firing mechanism whereby a smouldering match cord was clamped to a lever on the gun which by pressure on a trigger was lowered into a pan containing an ignition charge. Known as the serpentine lock the first European example dates to around 1411 but it may have originated earlier in China. Later the arm or serpentine was powered by a spring and the discreet components which had been mounted directly to the stock were fitted onto a lockplate. These early spring powered matchlocks are often referred to as snaplocks. Wheel-lock This operates by lowering a piece of iron pyrites onto a roughened spinning disk to create sparks which ignite powder in the pan. The main problem with this system is that it had to be wound up with a spanner which was slow and there was always the risk of the spanner being lost. Flintlock Operates by hammering a piece of flint clamped in the cock against a steel or frizzen to shower sparks into the pan. The wheellock was self contained but expensive while the cheaper snaplock / matchlock was awkward to use, with the cord presenting a fire risk in the proximity of gunpowder and needing a separate ignition source. By using a powerful spring to strike a flint against steel the progression from matchlock to flintlock was a simple evolution and the early flintlocks bear a strong resemblance to later matchlock mechanisms. These early flintlocks are also sometimes referred to as snap locks but more often the term snaphance is used. The evolution from early snaphance to the flintlock proper was largely determined by the differing methods of regional gunmakers to make a usable locks. The problem was the need for a gun that could be loaded and primed at the earliest opportunity and then fired with minimal effort some time later. This meant that the priming powder had to be held in the mechanism by a pan cover which had to be moved out of the way for firing but at the same time the gun had to be safe from accidental discharge. Various methods of achieving this were devised and in some instances part of one system may have been used with parts of another which can blur distinctions between various types of lock, nevertheless the following types are generally recognised. Scandinavian / Russian lock. This was a relatively primitive lock with a pan cover that was pushed out of the way by hand before firing. (Note country designations are blurred as well, generally they were popular in the regions given but not exclusive). Swedish Lock c1620 The pan cover and steel were combined but the steel could be rotated through 90 degrees so that it was not presented to the flint before firing. Dutch Lock The pan cover was separate from the steel which was fixed. On firing the cock was linked to the pan cover and pushed it out of the way. English Lock c1630 The pan cover and steel were combined. On firing the flint ran down the steel which rotated forward to lift the pan cover which is exactly how we might expect a flintlock to operate. With a combined pan and steel it is impossible to carry the gun with the lock relaxed without the pan being open (and loosing the powder) and it is not safe to carry the gun safely with the lock cocked. The solution was to introduce a third position where the pan may be closed but the lock not fully engaged so the gun is at half cock. This was done by introducing a spur that engaged with the cock (dog in English) at this intermediate position resulting in the doglock. This was very often supplemented by a catch on the lockplate which engaged manually with the cock and fell back of it\u2019s own accord on full cocking. Such catches are a means of identifying these locks externally but the actual doglock itself is internal. Mediterranean Lock c1625 Commonly known as the miquelet lock this archaic looking design had a powerful external mainspring, combined pan cover and steel and a half cock position. It had a very strong action and was quite robust considering many of the components were on the outside of the lock and due to its reliability it remained popular for many years. French Lock c1650 The French lock is sometimes considered to be THE flintlock. Combined pan cover and steel, half cock position in a streamlined design with all components except the pan cover spring being internal. For simplicity I have made no mention of sears, suffice it to say this lock had a vertical sear while it\u2019s predecessors were horizontal which made for an elegant and efficient design. The French lock also introduced internal bridles and low friction bearings which reduced lock time. It rapidly superseded all other locks except the miquelet which retained a loyal regional following due to the powerful shower of sparks it produced. So there is a very simple answer about the mechanics, but then comes the question as to how such advances influenced history but I think I\u2019ll leave that for another day. It all makes for a very interesting study and for anyone wanting to know more I recommend: The Flintlock, Torsten Lenk European Hand Firearms, Herbert Jackson Pollard\u2019s History of Firearms, Claude Blair ",

            "answer_text": "To be honest with you, I\u2019ve never never seen a miquelet lock up close, they were only used in Europe in Spain and I think they were of Arab origin. From what I have read it was one of the first true flintlocks. A matchlock used either a lever or trigger and sear to lower a lit slowmatch into a powder chamber to discharge a gun. Variations on this are the first true firearms, the hand gonne or hand cannon which involved simply touching the fuse by hand. A snaphaunce gun differs from a true flintlock in that the frizzen and pan cover are 2 different things on a snaphaunce, where they are one piece in a true flintlock. A doglock did not have a half-cock notch on the sear. Instead it had a lever called a dog that engaged the neck of the hammer and functioned as a safety. ",
