            "answer_text": "In 1973, I was assigned to Company E, MSG Battalion, Saigon. Early upon my arrival I was sent as part of the Marine Security Guard attachment to guard the American consulate in Nha Trang. Part of our job description was to check the offices in the consulate after business hours for any unsecured classified material. The Consulate had a second floor that was designated as, \u201cSpecial Assistant to the Consulate General\u201d or SACG. The entire second floor was CIA central and finding any classified material made for great reading. One night I had the 8\u201312 shift and Sgt, Barr, the NCOIC for the attachment stopped by. I was getting ready to make my rounds so we headed to the second floor. The first office we went into had an unsecured filing cabinet. Filing cabinets secured with a padlock could contain material classified up to Secret. Marine Guards were required to go through every item in the unsecured repository looking for the highest classification. Sitting in the top drawer was a large binder stamped secret across the front. As I examined the table of contents of the large binder I realized that it contained the bibliography information of 129 U.S. service members that had joined the North Vietnamese cause. The binder contained photos of individuals meeting with Ho Chi Minh and other North Vietnamese officials and outlined what their assigned roles were and where and when they were last seen. After we inventoried the cabinet, we filled out the required paperwork, left the pink copy of the violation inside the cabinet, secured the cabinet and continued on with the rest of the inspection. Robert R. Garwood who changed sides in 1965, can tell you what happened to most of them once the war had ended. ",

            "answer_text": "Nearly zero. Got a drug habit? Deserted/went AWOL? Committed suicide? All kinds of bad happened, over a ten year war, but the vast majority of troops still served an honorable tour. The screaming crying shame is what happened with those who returned and spoke out against the war, being treated like they had defected. If anybody had earned the right to speak out, they had. Meanwhile, \u201cCharlie\u201d didn\u2019t exactly have a great defector recruitment program. For a GI who could get some hot food, cold (or warm) beer, a poker game, some mail from home, and a pretty solid bet on going home in just 365 days, you\u2019re gonna go for rice balls in a jungle, surrounded by hard small people you don\u2019t understand, and accept that as your lot for the rest of your life? Yeeesh. ",
