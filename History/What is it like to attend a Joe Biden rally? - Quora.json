            "answer_text": "It was very quiet; you could hear crickets chirping. I was the only one in the audience. Then a seventy+ year old man stumbled onto the stage, struggled to pull his mask down, and said: \u201cI will be the president of all of the people, not just those who vote for me but for for those Nazis and racists who do not. You can hear them whooping and shouting from that Trump rally across town. We\u2019re gonna put them in chains, in camps, make them listen to Hilary speeches. Serve the bastards right. Some of those chumps say I can\u2019t put\u2026er\u2026uh\u2026two\u2026 ah\u2026words together, but they are just dumb. I went to graduate school, got twenty doctorates, do brain surgery just for the hell of it. Come on man! I was the real brains behind Obama, although\u2026 I really shouldn\u2019t say this\u2026 he was not too clean or smart. He made me sit through all those meetings in the White House, made me sit on a hard wooden chair that was shorter than all the other chairs and told me no keep my mouth shut! I asked to put a cushion on the chair because of my piles but he wouldn\u2019t let me. Bastard! I sat there in pain and didn\u2019t even feel like sniffing Angela Merkel\u2019s hair when she was there. Can you believe it? They are telling me in my earpiece to read the teleprompter\u2026to not get off message. But you try to concentrate on government business when you\u2019ve got piles. I tell you\u2026 can\u2019t be done. No way, Jose. I\u2019m sorry, didn\u2019t mean to say that \u2014 I need the Border Jumper vote. At the end of this race, when I beat George Bush and win the Senate, it will be just like when I beat Corn Pop, beat him like a drum. Man, that was something, made the silky hairs on my leg stand up. But I\u2019m not here in Boston\u2026 Denver\u2026 Kansas City\u2026Birmingham. Oh, what did you say Jill, Seattle! What the hell am I doing in Seattle. There\u2019s fires everywhere. Don\u2019t you know the streets are unsafe? Get me the hell out of here!\u201d His handlers came and rushed him off stage. Later that day, the event was accurately captured in the impartial news media: Joe Biden spoke at a well attended event in Seattle. He promised to be President of all the people and touted the piles of accomplishments he achieved while sharing the Oval Office with Barrack Obama. He discussed his experience fighting for justice in the black community and appealed for border reform. He applauded the people of Seattle for their police reforms and for their warm reception. Cheers could be hear across the town. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. No I didn't attend a Biden rally. I live in a solidly blue state. Anyway Democratic rallies are more about policy, not rah! Rah! Rah! So only policy wonks would attend . And with covid19 restrictions why go. ? . Politics is serious business. Hate fests seem to attract more attendees than love fests. That's just the way it is in politics. Its funny that this kind of rally started with another entertainment figure. Ronald Reagan!. His campaign started with pom pom girls and rah rah rah at campaign events and tons of flags.Although he did retain some dignity. Then Trump came and dignity went out the window. It became the only time on earth where the attendees can display their basest lack of humanity loudly and raucously without consequences. In fact they get rewarded by being recorded and displayed on TV in full insult mode. Whats not to like?. They can meet up with other like minded denizens and display their lowest common denominator . And be applauded by others of the same ilk who can only watch it on TV. I bet to them its better than sex! ",
