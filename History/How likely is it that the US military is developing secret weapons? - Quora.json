            "answer_text": " It\u2019s a dead certainty. There\u2019s even a special group tasked with developing them \u2014 DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. DARPA has funded research into everything from orbital vehicles to liquid lasers to smart bullets. Pictured above is the HULC, a prototype for a battery-powered exoskeleton. But here\u2019s the thing: The stuff you can find pictures of on the internet can\u2019t hold a candle to the stuff they actually keep secret.  This is a diagram of a chemical EMP bomb, a weapon that was supposedly impossible to develop. The Pentagon kept a real tight lid on it\u2014 until it was used in Desert Storm. That same war saw the testing of aerial-mounted x-ray lasers, another supposedly impossible weapon. The Navy is getting ready to start using railguns; the Army is quietly readying battle robots; there are microwave and sonic cannons. In the works are hypersonic glide vehicles, invisibility cloaks, aluminum-reinforced glass, acoustic tractor beams, self-healing electronics, and multiple types of directed energy weapons. And that\u2019s the stuff they\u2019ve leaked. ",

            "answer_text": "I prefer to direct your attention from the physical to the digital. The days of this gun vs that gun, this plane vs that plane are obsolete. So far as the US and advanced weapons are concerned, conventional warfare is dead. It is the age of the computer. I'm writing this from my mobile so bare with me with my lack of links. It takes a single b-52 with the proper jamming equipment to shut down a military airport. All those fancy planes unable to so much as taxi. It takes a handful of rootkits to obliterate a nations infrastructure. Fuel stations and electric grids tearing themselves apart. It took two researchers to learn to hack your car into driving you off a cliff. The future doesn't lie in big bombs anymore, it is about leveraging computers and technology against your enemy. So yes, the US is building new secret weapons. But not at area 51. At Fort Meade, in DARPA labs, at Langley, on computers and signal laboratories. Check out Nitro Zeus and Olympic Games. Stuxnet, arguably the most impressive malware we have seen was just a small part of that program. It is common belief that the US has/had malware and plans to annihilate Iran through malware. That was years ago. They have received much more funding and support. I shudder to think what they can do now. The battlefield of the future lies in computers and communications. That's where the real shit is being developed for ",
