            "answer_text": "Drug cartels do not sell drugs in New York City and they don't control any territory in New York City. Drug cartels only sell drugs BY THE TON (1,000 Kilograms) and then do not sell any drugs directly to drug dealers or to street gangs. The business of selling drugs to the consumers was tried a few decades ago and there is always a corner boy getting arrested and pointing to the gang leader and then the gang leader is arrested and he has no choice but to testify against his supplier and eventually the entire network is arrested. This is better explained in the film \"American Gangster\"  A while back a Harvard guy (One of the sons of the Capo) applied all his knowledge to reduce the risk of an arrest and they abandoned the retail side of the business and they focused exclusively on the wholesale of the business. There is only one distributor for the entire city of New York and the Cartel sell only to this man or woman and he is in charge of selling everything to everybody else. He only sells to a few big distributors and it is very dificult to destroy this clever distribution system. If one of the distributors is arrested then he will be killed to protect the rest of the organization. The triads are not a large criminal organization. It's more like a thousand small criminal organizations. One triad may be in charge of kidnappings and another triad may be in charge of guns in the same territory. If the ATF eventually infiltrates the gun triad and arrests everybody the drug triad is still working as usual. This clever strategy makes the destruction of the triads a very difficult thing. I don't know how the Russian mafia works. Like a small business fighting against a large business. A large business always controls a larger percent of the market. In this context, you could say the triads control only a very small percentage of the NYC market and the Russian mafia controls a very large percentage of the NYC market. Unless of course, the Russian mafia has evolved and they are not selling exclusively in bulk like the Mexican cartels. ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t say that they \u201ccontrol\u201d organized crime but more accurately have carded out niches for themselves. The Russian mafia heavily favor smuggling and trafficking schemes but are also very much into Real estate investing throughout NYC (not just Brooklyn). I know of several buildings that are owned by Russian mafia fronts throughout the city. It isn\u2019t hard to tell if you ever have cause to actually visit their office. Much like any New Yorker (a Native New Yorker not someone who moved to NY after college or acting school) knows when they have walked into an Italian Mafia establishment you can tell when you are in a Russian mafia office as well.
