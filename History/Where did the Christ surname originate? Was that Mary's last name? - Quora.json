            "answer_text": "Christ is not a surname and no it is not Mary\u2019s or Joseph\u2019s name. The term Christ comes from the Greek word Chirstos but was used by early Christian Jews who were looking for the anointed one or Messiah.  \"He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ\" (John 1:41). This came from Daniels prophesy;  Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall beseven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined (Daniel Dan 9:25-26). Using the Strong's Exhaustive Concordance Lexicon we can study both words for comparison.

G3323\u039c\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9\u0301\u03b1\u03c2Messiasmes-see'-asOf Hebrew origin [H4899]; the Messias(that is, Mashiach), or Christ: - Messias.H4899\u05de\u05e9\u05c1\u05d9\u05d7ma\u0302sh\u0131\u0302yachmaw-shee'-akhFrom H4886; anointed; usually a consecratedperson (as a king, priest, or saint); specifically the Messiah: - anointed, Messiah. H4886\u05de\u05e9\u05c1\u05d7ma\u0302shachmaw-shakh'A primitive root; to rubwith oil, that is, to anoint; by implication to consecrate; also to paint: - anoint, paint. The word Messiah grew out of an ancient Hebrew ceremony of anointing or rubbing down certain men with a special cocktail of spices and fragrant oils that, once completed, set the individual apart for certain Jewish positions in their culture, usually to become a prophet, priest or king. There is no record of Jesus being anointed in this manner; however, a certain woman came on one occasion and Mary  came on another occasion and anointed his feet, (Luke 7:38, John 12:3) Jesus was anointed on the day he was Baptized by John the Baptist, \"And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:\" (Mathew 3:16). It was after this happened he went into the desert for 40 days when he returned he began preaching everywhere and when he reached his hometown this is what happened;   And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read. And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears (Luke 4:16-21). Basically he said I am the Christ or Messiah. ",

            "answer_text": "As you\u2019d know if you read the rest of the New Testament, most people in that time did not have surnames. Some people had two names (e.g. \u201cSimon Peter\u201d), and some had nicknames based on where they were from (\u201cSaul of Tarsus\u201d, \u201cMary Magdalene\u201d, etc.) or by who their father was (e.g. \u201cSimon Barjonah\u201d, \u201cJames son of Zebedee\u201d) etc. There are still parts of the world where people don\u2019t have surnames but just list the given name of their father and grandfather. So Jesus is variously referred to as \u201cJesus of Nazareth\u201d, \u201cJesus son of David\u201d (referring to the tribe and family he was supposed to be from, as a descendant of King David who lived over a thousand years earlier), or in one case \u201cJesus, son of Mary\u201d which is totally bizarre and without precedent, and makes you wonder what happened to Joseph. In the Bible, a common question or statement is about whether Jesus is \u201cthe Christ\u201d. It\u2019s not a surname, at all. It\u2019s a honorific, that is, a title that was given to him by his followers. Here\u2019s just a few examples from the Bible that highlight this: When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, \u201cWho do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?\u201d So they said, \u201cSome say John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\u201d He said to them, \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d Simon Peter answered and said, \u201cYou are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\u201d Jesus answered and said to him, \u201cBlessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah,\u2026..\u2014 Matthew 16:13\u201317 (NKJV) Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well. \u2014 1 John 5:1 (NIV) In reality, the word \u201cChrist\u201d is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word \u201cMessiah\u201d. For example, in the first Bible reference I gave above, if you check it in different translations, many of them say \u201cthe Messiah\u201d, rather than \u201cthe Christ\u201d. So slowly, after Jesus\u2019 death and the growth of Christianity, the title \u201cChrist\u201d slowly began to be used a bit like a name, but Jesus was never called it like a name. By the way, this is why I hate non-Christians talking about Jesus as \u201cChrist\u201d, like it\u2019s a surname. Only people who venerate him should call him \u201cChrist\u201d, and even then it\u2019s more proper to say \u201cthe Christ\u201d. It\u2019s a little bit like Mohandas Gandhi, who often gets called \u201cMahatma Gandhi\u201d or \u201cthe Mahatma\u201d. \u201cMahatma\u201d was not his name. ",

Actually, the word Christ means Messiah, / Saviour; the Anointed One, chosen by God the Most High. Messiah = Christ = The Anointed One. It is a title, not an actual name but a Title. His earthly name was Yashua or Yahushua in his native Hebrew language, but others saw it fitting to change or translate His name to Jesus, however the letter J does not exist in the Hebrew language, therefore it could not be a legitimate translation, it therefore seem as if Christ\u2019s name was changed to suite a certain nation of people who presented a false image of Yahushua the Christ as being white, by using that of a white man called Cesare Borgia. Christ the Messiah should be called by His original Hebrew name and not by an English name as He was not an English man nor was He white. Why change His given Hebrew name? Also, think of this: why or how is it that all the disciples of Christ were from His nation, they were Israelites, why is it that they all have English names in the Bible? They were not Caucasians / Europeans or from an English or U.K /British origin, neither from the white race as Esau was not their progenitor; they were Jacob\u2019s descendants, dark skinned, what is called black in current times, how did their names become English when they were actual Hebrew Israelites from Jacob? Search the name Cesare Borgia on youtube or just google that name. See what took place with him, a process initiated by his father Pope Alexander 6th. ",

For instance, Jesus was born in Jerusalem which is in Judea (or the state of Judah), but he grew up in Nazareth. If you read the Scriptures, everyone knew Him as being from Nazareth. So, if we were to give Jesus a last name, it would\u2019ve been Nazareth because that is where He was from (like Leonardo da Vinci, who was from Vinci-a Metropolitan city of Florence, Italy). Most surnames were based on where a person was born or grew up. In the case of Jesus, there was no such city called Christ. My last name, for instance, means \u201cSon of Sancho\u201d which is an Iberian (Spain/Portugal peninsula) name of Basque (indigenous to and primarily inhabit an area traditionally known as the Basque Country) origin (Santxo, Santzo, Santso, Antzo, Sans). Most Spanish names ending in \u201cez (son of)\u201d are based on certain towns or cities in Spain. Mary (as Joseph) was from the Tribe of Judah (the state of Judea, also where Judaism [Jews] gets its name). ",

Christos, translation of Heb. mashia\u1e25, \u201canointed one\u201d) OT Israel anticipated a coming deliverer \u201canointed\u201d by God to initiate God\u2019s rule of righteousness and peace. Early Christians saw Jesus as fulfilling this hope [as a deliverer from death] and designated him \u201cChrist\u201d (Mark 8: 29; Acts 5: 42; Rom. 5: 6).1 \u00b9 What does \u201cChrist\u201d actually mean? | Our Rabbi Jesushttp://ourrabbijesus.com/articles/what-does-the-word-christ-actually-mean/ The word \u201cChrist\u201d comes from christos, a Greek word meaning \u201canointed.\u201d It is the equivalent of the word mashiach, or Messiah, in Hebrew. So, to be the Christ, or Messiah, is to be \u201cthe anointed one of God.\u201d To be anointed, literally, is to have sacred oil poured on one\u2019s head, because God has chosen the person for a special task. Priests and kings were anointed, and occasionally prophets. Kings were anointed during their coronation rather than receiving a crown. \u00b2 Mashiach: The Messiahhttp://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm Belief in the eventual coming of the mashiach is a basic and fundamental part of traditional Judaism. It is part of Rambam's 13 Principles of Faith,\u00b3 the minimum requirements of Jewish belief. In the Shemoneh Esrei prayer, recited three times daily, we pray for all of the elements of the coming of the mashiach: ingathering of the exiles;restoration of the religious courts of justice;an end of wickedness, sin and heresy;reward to the righteous;rebuilding of Jerusalem;restoration of the line of King David;and restoration of Temple service.\u00b3 The Thirteen Principles of Jewish Faith - Essentialshttp://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/332555/jewish/Maimonides-13-Principles-of-Faith.htm The great codifier of Torah law and Jewish philosophy, Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (\"Maimonides\" also known as \"The Rambam\"), compiled what he refers to as the Shloshah Asar Ikkarim, the \"Thirteen Fundamental Principles\" of the Jewish faith, as derived from the Torah. Maimonides refers to these thirteen principles of faith as \"the fundamental truths of our religion and its very foundations.\" ",

            "answer_text": "\"Christ\" is not a surname, it's a title.  It's appended to the Greek form of Yeshua's name as part of a claim that he was the Messiah, which in Greek is \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 (Christos).  This in turn is the Greek form of the Hebrew  \u05de\u05b8\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05d7\u05b7 (M\u0101\u0161\u00eea\u1e25) meaning \"anointed one\".  Ancient Jewish kings were ceremonially anointed with oil as a sign of their status and the Jews believed a new \"anointed one\" would be sent by God to save them.  The early Jesus sect believed Jesus was this \"Anointed\" and so referred to Jesus in this way.  So the gospels, which were written in Greek, call him \"\u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 \" which in English is \"Jesus the Christ\" or just \"Jesus Christ\".  It's a claim, not a name. It's for this reason that only Christians should refer to him as \"Jesus Christ\".  For we non-Christians, he's just \"Jesus\" or \"Jesus of Nazareth\".  Unless you believe he was in some sense \"the Christ\" it doesn't make sense to refer to him as such. Jesus' historical Aramaic name would have been Yeshua bar Yusef.  His mother would have been Mary\u0101m, which was rendered \u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 (Maria) in the Greek of the gospels which became \"Mary\" in English translations. ",

            "answer_text": "You have your answer for the Christ name not being a surname, but this is the perfect time for a small Surname lesson. Surnames didn't become necessary until the 12th or 13th century. Until people started to leave their family home and move into cities, everyone knew everyone in town. Duplicate names were handled by adding a patrynomic like Jesus son of Joseph or a job title Jesus the Carpenter. If people did emigrate from their town, the location of their home was often added to avoid duplication like Jesus of Nazareth. Interestingly enough, as people first began to get surnames those three choices showed up more than any other. Think of John Johnson, John Baker, or John Weinberger. All names hanging on from those three original ways to distinguish. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Christ\" is not a surname. It's a title. It comes from a Greek word meaning \"anointed one\". People often have ceremonies of some sort when a person is given an important position or achieves an important milestone. Like we have ceremonies for marriage, \"swearing in\" of presidents, etc. In those days it was a common part of the ceremony, when someone was appointed to a very high position like king or ambassador, to dribble some vegetable oil on their heads. I don't get the value of this, but then what is the value of most rituals? What's the point of shaking hands or handing a graduate an empty \"diploma folder\"? Anyway, this was called \"anointing\". Jesus was called \"the anointed one\" because he was chosen by God to come to Earth to perform a specific mission. So \"Jesus Christ\" isn't a first and last name, it's a name and a title. Like calling someone \"General Smith\". ",

That day John saw The Holy Spirit (of God) came down like a dove and settled in Jesus and said this is My Beloved Son in whom I am well pleased to dwell in (original translation). From that time, Jesus became Christ, that's why He always said the \u201cFather that dwells in Me\u201d. That was how He got the Name Christ. The Jews understood the meaning of this and that's why they accused Jesus Christ of equating Himself WITH GOD. Watch the phrase. No equating to, but with. ",

Nazareth being his home town. But to his followers he would have been Jesus Christ, meaning Jesus the Anointed One. It\u2019s a reference to a specific ritual using sacred oil. But it\u2019s also the Greek translation of Messiah, which is what the Christians believed Jesus to be. So Jesus Christ means Jesus the Messiah. ",

So, the movie got it right: The Passion of the Christ.  Even in the Gospels, Peter says, \"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" It is true that even from Biblical times, people also referred to Jesus simply as \"Christ\" - but ultimately, it is a title, not a name. Oh, and on a related note, His middle initial is not \"H.\"! :-P ",
