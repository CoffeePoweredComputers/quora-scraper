            "answer_text": "Everything you put in your body is medicine or poison. There is no such thing as a pharmaceutical defficiency. But one persons poison may be another persons medicine. If you ingest it, inhale it or come in to contact with it in some cases it\u2019s one or the other. So yes spices and herbs are medicine, some are more medical and have to be taken in small doses to avoid getting too out of balance others are more like regular foods in which too much on ocassion isn\u2019t too bad. Things like cumin, cinnamon, vanilla, cayenne, tumeric are exceptional medicines to take on a daily basis, Here is a brief infographic on some of those.

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. It depends on how you use them. Medicine as a scientific term is really a drug. A drug is a chemical that has been taken from a natural item and often synthesized(made into a copy-cat fake chemical version that can be patented as natural items can\u2019t be legally patented) and has all the natural buffers that make it gentle and safer removed to make it harsh and effective to the point of killing a person IF too much is taken. A spice is something that adds flavor to food, but in many cases does more than that if taken in a certain way or in a certain dose. Herbs are essentially plants. They also add flavor. Flavors can be savory or sweet. They enhance a meal to make it more desirable and aromatic. They often also have ingredients, naturally occurring chemicals that have an impact on the body especially if condensed to a stronger form so the impact is greater. Like many words in the English language, medicine can be used in different ways. It can be used scientifically to mean something prescribed by the doctor or can be used to mean something you take to be healthy, as in the phrase, Let food be your medicine. Hope this is helpful to you, Esther ",
