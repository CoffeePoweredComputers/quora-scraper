            "answer_text": "The numbersAccording to Wolfram Alpha, Chinese Universalism is believed by 29% and Buddhism and Christianity is tied at 8.5% so possibly Christianity may have edged out Buddhism - but really? Until any religion is edging out Chinese Universalism then you might have some sort of claim that a particular religion is having an impact on china but surely by any possible logic 8.5% is not really what I would call \"Jesus conquering\" Put another way, It is like saying USA is 4.5% of the population and has edged out Indonesia who only has 4% of the worlds population. When will the \"USA conquor\" the world. Hmmm. Actually that might be a different / more believable question / bad analogy.   When will USA population reach 100%? while China and India represent 34% of the worlds population. Bad mathematics sectionIf we take that Christian Missionary work started in 635AD then we can make some grossly simplistic extrapolation from 0 to 8.5% by 2012 then it has grown at 0.06 of one percent in that time. If we assume a steady growth across that time (again stupid to do so) then it would 1666 years until \"Jesus won\". But you would ignore variation of uptake (eg missionary effectiveness) so this is the closest I could think of that might get close. BUT you would have to do the same extrapolation of all the other religions simultaneously so it is lame maths. Commentary on the line \"How long until Jesus conquors China\"Um.... from a non Christian perspective hearing Christians say when will \"Jesus conquer something\" it sounds the same as (and possibly as offensive as) me saying \"when will Richard Dawkins defeat the christians?\" or when will \"Muhammad conquer\" the USA?  Chinese may not like the idea that someone thinks of them being conquered...and from a Christian perspective maybe Mathew 5:5  might be a smarter and more classy route - something about meek, and conquering the earth or something? From a logical perspective, you can understand why questions that contain pre-suppositions are always much lower quality questions than those which don't? * * A bit of irony. I try not to be arrogant or assume I guess I get a bit frustrated when I see a standard Euro-American / Western view of the world and a presupposition that what we have been brought up with is the correct way, when we really are being overly arrogant given that China and India are far greater populations and represent such a large culture, that when I am presented with a people and a history I am not familiar, my first instinct is not to think, \"My religion or my culture must be the correct one, I wonder when I will conquer them?\". It is my desire to really listen, to question my own assumptions, and see all the ways that Buddhism or Atheism or Christianity or being an idiot or whatever is greater than my current world view.  Because, by me taking this approach, it doesn't become me trying to beat another culture, I am able to take the very best parts of it, actively think about why I have my own belief, and change my belief for something greater than either was to start with. Actually you Christians sum up my approach quite nicely in Ephesians 4:2 \"Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.\" So in summary, it is possible that the Buddhism and Christianity in China may fluctuate, though both have long and proud traditions in that country and changing a religion can be reasonably rare thing as so many people grip on tight to their beliefs. And also we need to put 8.5 % into context.    And we also have to realize that Atheism is really quite a fast moving force also. ",

            "answer_text": "All the tales about the growth of Christianity in China are vicious fake news spread by the evangelical Christian lobby in America, mostly as part of campaigns of yellow journalism, i.e. deliberately fabricated fake news, exaggerations and sensationalism meant to overawe the foe\u2014China in this case\u2014and bend public opinion against it.  These fake news are spread through the Anglo-American media by evangelical Christian organisations such as the John Templeton Foundation and many others, and by scholars who are financed by them. The scholar who has been the main propagator of this type of information in recent years is the Chinese American Christian Fenggang Yang. We read: <<Fenggang Yang is openly Christian and his theories have been criticized as biased in favor of Christianity by many other scholars of Chinese religion. [\u2026] The Center on Religion and Chinese Society is funded by the Templeton Foundation, an American organization criticized for promoting Christian-biased research in the field of religious studies. Fenggang Yang was granted $9.5 million by the Templeton Foundation to develop his projects. His statistics and projections about Christianity in China have been disputed by authorities in China and scholars including Shen Guiping. In 2014 he claimed that \"China will be home to the world's largest Christian congregation by 2030\", despite in 2010 he said that \"Christians remain a small minority in China today\", based on a survey which found that they were \"33 million, much less than most of the popular speculations\". Surveys conducted in 2014 by Chinese research institutes found a similar number of Christians, or around 2% of the population. The 2014 claim was, as proclaimed by Yang himself, \"based on the Pew Research Center's report of Global Christianity\", another project backed by the Templeton Foundation.>> From reliable sources (the excerpts are from the Wikipedia article about \u201cReligion in China\u201d), we also know that: <<Andr\u00e9 Lalibert\u00e9 noted that despite there having been much talk about \"persecution against religion (especially Christianity) in China\", one should not jump to hasty conclusions, since \"a large proportion of the population worship, pray, perform rituals and hold certain beliefs with the full support of the Party. Most of this activity affects people who subscribe to world views that are sometimes formally acknowledged by the state and are institutionalised, or others that are tacitly approved as customs\". In this context, Christianity not only represents a small proportion of the population, but its adherents are still seen by the majority who observe traditional rituals as followers of a foreign religion that sets them apart from the body of society.>> Lalibert\u00e9, Andr\u00e9 (2011). \u201cReligion and the State in China: The Limits of Institutionalization\u201d. Journal of Current Chinese Affairs. 40 (2): 3\u201315.From an academic article criticising Rodney Stark\u2019s book A Star in the East, which is published by the Templeton Foundation, we know that: <<There has been much speculation by some Western authors about the number of Christians in China. Chris White, in a 2017 work for the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity of the Max Planck Society, criticises the data and narratives put forward by these authors. He notices that these authors work in the wake of a \"Western evangelical bias\" reflected in the coverage carried forward by popular media, especially in the United States, which rely upon a \"considerable romanticisation\" of Chinese Christians. Their data are mostly ungrounded or manipulated through undue interpretations, as \"survey results do not support the authors' assertions\".>> White, Chris (2017). \u201cCounting Christians in China: A critical reading of Rodney Stark\u2019s A star in the East: The rise of Christianity in China\u201d. MMG Working Paper 17-03. G\u00f6ttingen: Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity. ISSN 2192-2357. These are the results of scientific surveys conducted by the Chinese Family Panel Studies in 2012 and 2014:  As you can see, the identification with Buddhism has seen a big increase in 2014 (due to the change in survey methodologies which allowed for a better estimation of religious populations outside the state-sanctioned religious institutions). Protestantism and Catholicism are, instead, static. The following table shows the distribution of religions by age group according to the CFPS 2012. As you can see, Christianity, while being a small minority in all age groups, is more popular among the elderly (2.9%), while decreases among the youth (1.5%). So, Christianity in China is not growing at all; actually, it is declining among the younger generations of Chinese.  Data reported in: Wenzel-Teuber, Katharina (2017). \u201cStatistics on Religions and Churches in the People\u2019s Republic of China\u201d. Religions & Christianity in Today's China. (VII) 2: 26-53. China Zentrum e.V. ISSN: 2192-9289. Besides, it is worthwhile to acknowledge that Buddhism is not the largest religion in China. The largest religion among the Chinese is a \u201ccosmic religion\u201d which is an integral aspect of the Chinese identity itself, consisting in the worship of the gods of the environment and of the forefathers of the Chinese ethnicity. For this reason, this religion does not have an objectifying name (though some scholars have named it either \u201cShenism\u201d or \u201cShenxianism\u201d, and it is known in the West as \u201cChinese religion\u201d or \u201cChinese popular religion\u201d). 80% of the Chinese practise this religion, though it does not show up in surveys since it is not even considered a \u201creligion\u201d (zongjiao) in Chinese terminology, but rather a tradition of culture. The term \u201creligion\u201d in China is used exclusively for doctrinal religions (like Buddhism and Christianity). Huangdi, the \u201cYellow Emperor\u201d, forefather of the Chinese race and representation on earth of the God of the north pole stars (Shangdi, the \u201cSupreme Deity\u201d), is the ethnic god of the Chinese:   ",
