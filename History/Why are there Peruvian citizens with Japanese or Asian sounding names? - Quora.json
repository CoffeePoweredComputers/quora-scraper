            "answer_text": "About names I don't know, but if you mean surnames, that's because they have Asian ancestors. It's not uncommon for me, as a teacher, to have students with Chinese or Japanese surnames. I even had a student with a Korean paternal surname (her maternal surname was Spanish, though). A friend I had as a child had a Chinese surname (Chong). A friend at university as well (Wong), a teacher at university (Sen), a teacher at language school (Morikone (that's Japanese)) and one of my bosses (Chang). Even though the presence of Asians is reported since colonial times, we can say that the first Chinese arrived in Peru in 1849, and the Japanese in 1899. Others came throughout the 20th century; it's perfectly possible to find their descendants as classmates, neighbors, famous people and even partners (I have notice that, compared to the Japanese, the Chinese had more tendency to marry Peruvians, thus their descendants having, in many cases, only one Asian surname, the other being Spanish or native Peruvian). Some famous (and infamous) Peruvians of Asian descent I remember: Alberto Fujimori (former President) Jaime Yoshiyama (politician) Eduardo Arakaki (ex footballer) Patricia Wong (model and entrepreneur) Aldo Miyashiro (TV presenter and producer) Augusto Higa (writer) M\u00f3nica Chang (journalist) Tilsa Tsuchiya (painter) Javier Wong (chef) Mitsuharu Tsumura (chef) Marino Morikawa (scientist) Etc.

            "answer_text": "Peru has a very special history regarding its relations with the Chinese and Japanese, whom formed as the two largest Asian communities there. Together with the Arab community, they are core of Asian community in the country. However, Arab and Japanese tend to integrate better due to many reasons: Most Arabs coming from Middle East were both Christians and Muslims, but the Arab muslims had later converted to Roman Catholicism and integrated within the society, adapting Christian name, hence they disconnected with their Arab heritage.Japanese came to Peru when Peru was extremely needing labors. Japan, however, demanded to have equal treatment with other Western powers, thus Japanese people were more able to keep up their ancestral and cultural root while helping Peruvian society to be more entertaining.The Chinese are just only better integrated recently due to many reasons: Oppression. Historically, Peruvian owners were extremely hostile against Chinese due to its problems regarding labor skills. However, the following consequence of war between Peru and Chile led it become massacre. Being ravaged by Chilean Army and its Chinese allies, Peruvian locals attacked and murdered Chinese due to Chinese support for Chile against them.Ban. Peruvian Government was extremely skeptic of Chinese and the war against Chile highlighted its suspicion. At 20th century, the wound still remains and, since conflict with Chile might occur anytime, Lima issued anti-Chinese ban, legally looting Chinatown in Peru and prohibiting Chinese from immigrating to the country. The ban was overturned only at late 1970s.Peruvians carry these names due to this track, but likely we will see more Arab and Japanese ending names than Chinese. Nonetheless, Asian Peruvians have been able to flourish and establish a large chunk of influence within the nation, that the country was even ruled by a Japanese. ",
