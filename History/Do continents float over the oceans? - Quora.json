            "answer_text": "The  oceans are like huge puddles.  There is no water under the continents.   There is liquid rock under the continents; this is called the Earth's mantle.  It's so hot that the rock is  melted.  That's what the continents are floating on. Although note that \"floating\" is not an entirely accurate word to describe it.  The hard parts of the Earth's crust are not literally floating on a surging sea down there.   \"Earth's crust \"floats\" on the hot, molten layer of the mantle. This molten layer is a dense \"magma\" that supports the lighter crust.   The crust has different thicknesses and composition depending on where  it is located. Some of the crust is mostly terrestrial (forming the  continents), but much of it is marine (underlying the bottoms of the  oceans). The rigid material that floats on Earth's surface is termed the  lithosphere. The low velocity plastic layer (molten magma) under the  lithosphere is called the asthenosphere. It is believed that heat  induced convection currents in the asthenosphere move (or float) the  lithosphere.\" [1] [1] Image and quote Source: Marine Geology: Plate Tectonics EDIT:  See also Alden Wilner's answer to What is a good, everyday analog for the viscosity of the upper mantle to help me better visualize how it flows?

The lithosphere, which is the rigid outermost shell of a planet (the crust and upper mantle), is broken into tectonic plates. The Earth's lithosphere is composed of seven or eight major plates Pangaea's formation is now commonly explained in terms of plate tectonics. Pangaea was once super continent approximately 335 million years ago. It began to break apart 175 million years ago. All of the Earth\u2019s continents float on tectonic plates which glide slowly over a plastic-like layer of the upper mantle. Because Australia sits on the fastest moving continental tectonic plate in the world, coordinates measured in the past continue changing over time. Australia is currently in collision with Asia. The continent is moving north by about 7cm every year. In the future we can expect Australia to continue moving northward, rotating counter-clockwise as it swings past Borneo and arrives at China's doorstep.

If (when?) the next ice age really gets going, global sea levels will drop and (as they have many times before) expose this land once again. I call dibs on the Bering Land Bridge. On the other hand, if global warming really kicks in and significant parts of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets melt, coastal cities worldwide will be slowly inundated as sea levels rise. Fun fact: The lower 150 miles or so of the Hudson River is an estuary. If New York City goes under, Albany goes with it. ",

Continents which are composed of giant tectonic plate compose the crust of the earth and the crust floats on top of a layer of magma called the earth\u2019s mantle.  The plates (whether oceanic or continental) rest on the magma, where they meet other plates there is usually convergence and divergence underwater magma can get released through underwater volcanoes (that is what creates volcanic islands). Now finally to get to the water in the ocean; the water floats on top of the plates which float on top of the magma. So, no continents do not float over the oceans. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is, it doesn\u2019t. The continental plates are lighter than the ocean plate so they float on top of those plates. Ocean and continental plates have different compositions which gives them different properties, including density. An example is, one cubic foot of steel is heavier that one cubic foot of water. The ocean\u2019s composition is primarily basalt. It forms when the mantle underneath partially melts, than crystallizes. This partial melting allows the ocean crust to sit on top of the mantle. The continental crust has a lower density than the ocean crust due to multiple cycles of partial melting which leads to a granite composition. Just underneath the crust of the plates is the Asthenosphere which both crusts float on. There are tectonic plate boundaries which forces the oceanic plates underneath the continental plates. This is called subduction. The ocean plates go deep enough to start melting inside the asthenosphere and ultimately the mantle.  ",

So what ! \u2026question is about floating of continent ? ok so answer is Yes. Actually continents are the part of lithosphere and lithosphere is made of continental and oceanic crust plus upper mantle that is Aesthenosphere. Ok than ? so, the continent or the huge land masses we see on Atlas surrounded by water (but europe!) are actually made of silica and Aluminium majorly and the oceanic floor or the abyss is made of silica and magnesium. As the density of Si and Al is less than Si and Mg. so yes, the continents are floating. but. . . but .. but . dont ever confuse yourself with this being the reason of continental drift which is basically because of continental plate and convection cell/Aesthenospheric relation. Hoping this was useful. Thanks for reading. ",

The world's surface is shaped like a blend of mountain ranges, some twice the height of most of the ones we regularly see, some valleys even deeper than Everest is high, plains at various levels, huge cliffs and thousands of rock pinnacles with cities on top. We also have immense amounts of water, most of it full of salt, filling all the low valleys, surrounding the pinnacles and covering much of the plains. The land that sticks out of the water are our continents. The continents aren't supported by the water, it's the other way around! Our earth's landforms hold the water for our use, and the continents provide us with a place to stay so that we can enjoy that water. ",
