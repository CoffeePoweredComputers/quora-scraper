This are solved by the so called Mismatch Repair (MMR) pathwaynucleotide cross linking resulting from exposure to UV light for example are resolved via the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER ) pathwaynucleotide base modification resulting for example from the exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS) are handled by the Base Excision Repair (BER ) pathway",
