So let\u2019s go with the one my butt just shot, shall we? Is it called a butt shot, even if the phone wasn\u2019t in your butt pocket? Is there another name for going into your photos and finding a shot you didn\u2019t take, from just a moment ago? An IPS? (Involuntary Photo Snap?) In the end, that\u2019s neither here nor there, because if this is a butt shot, my butt has a serious glitch, and I better see a proctologist ASAP. Maybe I better see a dermatologist, too, because I don\u2019t believe my skin has ever been that kind of color before. And I don\u2019t have filth on my arm, or leg, or whatever fucking limb that is!  I don\u2019t think this bodes particularly well for my new phone, either. Disturbing. ",

            "answer_text": "This is the famous Thor\u2019s Well, in Oregon. People love to photograph it, but too many people insist on getting too close to its edge. The first picture was shot by photographer Antonette Villanueva. This is the type of shot photographers are trying to achieve. Unfortunately this shot requires you to get way too close to this powerful, majestic beast.  At high tide, the waves roll underneath the bowl, filling it from the bottom until it bubbles out the top or bursts up in violent spray. The water then rolls back into the hole, and it fills and drains endlessly, making Thor\u2019s Well a go-to spot for photographers of all levels. Below is my shot taken from a safe distance. I implored this gentleman not to go too close, as the waves were building, and the tide was coming in. His desire to get \u2018That Shot\u2019 nearly ended his life.  He was so close to death, it was the scariest thing I have ever seen, he got knocked off his feet, was on his back in the water aimlessly being tossed about, he lost his camera, he was bloodied and battered. Purely by the grace of God, he is still alive. This happened after sunset. The only light was from the sun\u2019s afterglow. I\u2019m totally fine getting a crappy shot, wave in the background, it\u2019s not dramatic, but I get to go home to my family.  ",
