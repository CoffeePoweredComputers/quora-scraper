            "answer_text": "If you mean the Triple Alliance of 1882, or the Triplice, it was a military and political agreement between Central European countries; Germany, Austria Hungary, and Italy. It was formed to counter balance the perceived threat of the alliance of Britain and France, with Russia eventually joining. It's goal was to balance out the powers of Europe in that if one country was attacked, they would have each other's backs. It was also done to further socio-economic means as well, as the Western Europe had grown very rich off trade from the Americas, whereas Central Europes main source of trade was the Mediterranean. This came to an end on 1915, as WWI had just started the previous year, and Italy backed out, creating a new alliance between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey(or back then, the Ottoman Empire). The historical significance of these kind of \u201c\"buddy clubs\u201d, which was replaced by the League of Nations and then after WWII the United Nations, was to further each other's interests; the problem lay with the fact that these little cliques operated much like cliques in high school. Many countries were excluded from certain \u201cclubs\u201d and relied on just a few other countries. This exploded in WWI when Ferdinand, the archduke of Austria, was killed by a Serbian nationalist. A domino effect started, where Austria declared war on Serbia, who was in a clique with Russia. Russia declared war on Austria, so Germany declared war on Russia. Britain and France, being Russia's allies, declared war on Germany. Because there was no centralized, major coalition of nations like we have today, these countries went to war because when a countries prime exports are with solely another couple of countries, then you must do all you can to protect those allies. The lasting effect was to show the world that s multi nation league was much more effective, as it prevented bias against any certain country, with the guarantee that all countries would have fair trade, and not just with favored ones. The lasting effect is what we know today as the United Nations, a solution to the \u201cclique\u201d political system that existed until the war. ",
