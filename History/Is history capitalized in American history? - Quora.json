            "answer_text": "Do you mean that, when referring to American history in writing, you should instead refer to it as American History? The answer is no. That said, when it comes to mundane questions about capitalization, style always comes into play. Style guides set forth rules for issues like these. For instance, the style guide used by the New York Times has the nutty idea that the word \u201cteenager\u201d should be hyphenated as \u201cteen-ager\u201d. Personally I wouldn\u2019t dream of hyphenating \u201cteenager\u201d, but the whole point of any style guide is that consistency is important. That means if Times Journalist A is going to hyphenate \u201cteenager\u201d then Times Journalist B (as well as C, D, E and so on) must also hyphenate it. This is a longwinded way of saying that if you\u2019re going to write about American history (in an essay, for instance), you\u2019ve got to decide whether or not you want to capitalize the word \u201chistory\u201d and, if your answer is yes, be consistent by capitalizing it throughout. Personally I\u2019d caution you to avoid such an approach because, inevitably, your readers are going to wonder why you made this rather unusual choice. Still, it is your choice to make. ",
