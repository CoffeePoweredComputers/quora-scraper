            "answer_text": "Well, when it comes to the matter of choosing Optional, you've to choose the one which you are more interested in. Definitely there is a lot of competition when it comes to PUB AD, but if you work hard in your own way and try to study it like a story instead of a theory it is pretty much interesting. Just imagine yourself in every topic (Ex: there are theories written by administrative thinkers, imagine yourself in that theory as a leader and how you would like to manage the situation) and it's not really hard to grasp it. Coming to sociology, I hardly know anything about it, sorry I cannot help you with this subject. 1 point to remember, choose any subject which you would not get bored of, coz you have a better chance of scoring more in the optional than in general studies papers. Work out your way of studying the subject. Do not read more than 1 book for each paper, be very strong at the basics of each topic and each subject.Revise as much as possible.Give your best shotALL THE BEST!! ",

Both have good prospects in GS and optional though Pub Ad has an edge as adding to optional you could cover some of GS mains stuffs too. But then, better go through the syllabus of both and then decide. Nothing like success ratio,etc going to help you clear, after all, its your interest in the subject! Mohit Anand Shrivastav ",
