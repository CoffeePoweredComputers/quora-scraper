            "answer_text": "All the descendants of Jacob, collectively, at any one time were Israelites. (Exodus 9:4; Joshua 3:7; Ezra 2:2b; Matthew 8:10) As the offspring & descendants of Jacob\u2019s 12 sons, they were quite often called \u201cthe sons of Israel\u201d; less often, \u201cthe house of Israel,\u201d \u201cthe people of Israel,\u201d the \u201cmen of Israel,\u201d \u201cthe state of Israel,\u201d or the \u201cIsraelites.\u201d - Genesis 32:32; Mt 10:6; Acts 4:10; 5:35; Ephesians 2:12; Romans 9:4. In 1728 B.C.E. famine caused the household of Jacob to travel to Egypt, where, as alien residents, their descendants remained for 215 years. All the Israelites reckoned as \u201cof the house of Jacob who came into Egypt,\u201d not counting the wives of Jacob\u2019s sons, were 70. But during their sojourn there they became a very large society of slaves, totalling perhaps some two or three million or more.\u2014Ge 46:26, 27; Ex 1:7. On his deathbed Jacob blessed his 12 sons in this order: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Zebulun, Issachar, Dan, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Joseph, Benjamin; & through them the patriarchal tribal arrangement was continued. (Ge 49:2-28) However, during Israel\u2019s period of slavery the Egyptians set up their own overseer system, independent of the patriarchal establishment, designating certain ones from among the Israelites as officers. These kept count of the bricks produced & assisted the Egyptian overlords, who drove the Israelites to work. (Ex 5:6-19) Moses, on the other hand, when making known Jehovah\u2019s instructions to the congregation, did so through \u201cthe older men of Israel\u201d who were the hereditary heads of the paternal houses. They were also the ones who accompanied him when appearing before Pharaoh. - Ex 3:16, 18; 4:29, 30; 12:21. In due time, at the end of the predetermined 400-year period of affliction, in 1513 B.C.E., Jehovah crushed the dominating world power of Egypt &, with a great display of his Sovereign Almightiness, brought his people Israel out of slavery. With them came \u201ca vast mixed company\u201d of non-Israelites who were happy to cast their lot in with that of God\u2019s chosen people. - Ge 15:13; Ac 7:6; Ex 12:38. Birth of the Nation: Under the covenant made with Abraham, the resultant congregation of Israel was viewed as a single individual & , therefore, a close relative could reclaim or repurchase them from their slavery. Jehovah was that close relative by this legal covenant, indeed, their Father, & as the rightful Repurchaser he used punitive force to kill Pharaoh\u2019s firstborn for refusing to release God\u2019s \u201cfirstborn\u201d son Israel. (Ex 4:22, 23; 6:2-7) Thus legally delivered from Egypt, Israel became the exclusive property of Jehovah. \u201cYou people only have I known out of all the families of the ground,\u201d he said. (Am 3:2; Ex 19:5, 6; De 7:6) God now saw fit, however, to deal with them, not strictly as a patriarchal society, but as the nation of Israel, which he created & to which he gave a theocratic government founded on the Law covenant as a constitution. Within three months after Israel left Egypt it became an independent nation under the Law covenant inaugurated at Mount Sinai. (Hebrews 9:19, 20) The Ten Words, or Ten Commandments, written \u201cby God\u2019s finger\u201d formed the framework of that national code, to which some 600 other laws, statutes, regulations, & judicial decisions were added. This made it the most comprehensive set of laws possessed by any ancient nation, spelling out as it did in great detail the relationship between man & God, as well as between & and his fellowmen.\u2014Ex 31:18; 34:27, 28. Israel After the Babylonian Exile: Following the death of Solomon & the breaking up of the united kingdom & on down to the destruction of Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E., the term \u201cIsrael\u201d usually applied only to the ten tribes under the rule of the northern kingdom. (2Ki 17:21-23) But with the return of a remnant of all 12 tribes from exile, & continuing on down to the second destruction of Jerusalem in 70 C.E., the term \u201cIsrael\u201d once again embraced the whole of Jacob\u2019s descendants living at that time. Again the people of all 12 tribes were called \u201call Israel.\u201d - Ezra 2:70; 6:17; 10:5; Nehemiah 12:47; Acts 2:22, 36. Those who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel & High Priest Joshua in 537 B.C.E. numbered nearly 50,000 (42,360 Israelites & in addition over 7,500 slaves & professional singers), & these began rebuilding Jehovah\u2019s house of worship. (Ezra 3:1, 2; 5:1, 2) Later others returned with Ezra in 468 B.C.E. (Ezra 7:1\u20138:36), & still later, in 455 B.C.E., no doubt others accompanied Nehemiah when he came to Jerusalem with the special assignment to rebuild the walls & gates of the city. (Ne 2:5-9) Many Israelites, however, remained scattered throughout the empire, as noted in the book of Esther. - Esther 3:8; 8:8-14; 9:30. While Israel did not return to its former sovereignty as an independent nation, yet it did become a Hebrew commonwealth with considerable freedom under Persian domination. Deputy rulers & governors (like Zerubbabel & Nehemiah) were appointed from among the Israelites themselves. (Ne 2:16-18; 5:14, 15; Haggai 1:1) The older men of Israel & the tribal princes continued to act as counsellors & representatives of the people. (Ezr 10:8, 14) The priestly organisation was re-established, based on the ancient genealogical records that had been carefully preserved, & with such Levitical arrangement once again in operation, the sacrifices & other requirements of the Law covenant were observed. - Ezra 2:59-63; 8:1-14; Ne 8:1-18. With the fall of the Persian Empire & the rise of Grecian domination of the world, Israel found itself torn by the conflict between the Ptolemies of Egypt & the Seleucids of Syria. The latter, during the rule of Antiochus IV (Epiphanes), determined to eradicate Jewish worship & customs. His effort reached a climax in 168 B.C.E. when a pagan altar was erected atop the temple altar in Jerusalem & dedicated to the Greek god Zeus. This outrageous incident, however, had a reverse effect, for it was the spark that touched off the Maccabean uprising. Three years later, to the day, victorious Jewish leader Judas Maccabaeus rededicated the cleansed temple to Jehovah with a festival that has since been commemorated by the Jews as Hanukkah. The century that followed was one of great internal disorder in which Israel was led further & further away from the tribal administrative provisions of the Law covenant. It was during this period when home rule by the Maccabeans or Hasmonaeans met with varying fortunes, & when the parties of the pro-Hasmonaean Sadducees & the anti-Hasmonaean Pharisees developed. Finally Rome, by now the world power, was called upon to interfere. General Gnaeus Pompey intervened, & after a three-month siege he took Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. & annexed Judea to the empire. Herod the Great was appointed king of the Jews by Rome in about 39 B.C.E., & about three years later he effectively crushed the Hasmonaean rule. Shortly before Herod\u2019s death Jesus was born in 2 B.C.E., as \u201ca glory of your people Israel.\u201d - Luke 2:32. Rome\u2019s imperial authority over Israel during the first century C.E. was distributed among district rulers & governors, or procurators. The Bible mentions such district rulers as Philip, Lysanias, & Herod Antipas (Luke 3:1); as well as Governors Pontius Pilate, Felix, & Festus (Ac 23:26; 24:27); & Kings Agrippa I & II (Acts 12:1; 25:13). Internally, there still remained some semblance of the tribal genealogical arrangement, as is seen when Caesar Augustus had Israelites register in the respective cities of their paternal houses. (Lu 2:1-5) Among the people \u201cthe older men\u201d & the priestly Levitical functionaries were still very influential (Mt 21:23; 26:47, 57; Ac 4:5, 23), though they had, to a large degree, substituted the traditions of men for the written requirements of the Law covenant. - Mt 15:1-11. In such an atmosphere Christianity had its birth. First came John the Baptist, the forerunner of Jesus, who turned many of the Israelites back to Jehovah. (Lu 1:16; Joh 1:31) Then Jesus and his apostles followed up in the rescue work, labouring as they did among \u201cthe lost sheep of the house of Israel,\u201d opening blind eyes to the false traditions of men & to the excelling benefits of pure worship of God. (Mt 15:24; 10:6) Yet, only a remnant accepted Jesus as Messiah & were saved. (Romans 9:27; 11:7) These were the ones that joyfully hailed him as the \u201cKing of Israel.\u201d (John 1:49; 12:12, 13) The majority, refusing to put faith in Jesus (Mt 8:10; Ro 9:31, 32), backed up their religious leaders who cried out: \u201cTake him away! Take him away! Impale him!\u201d \u201cWe have no king but Caesar.\u201d - Joh 19:15; Mr 15:11-15. Time soon proved that this pretended solid fidelity to Caesar was false. Fanatical elements in Israel fomented one revolt after another, & each time the province suffered harsh Roman reprisals, reprisals that, in turn, increased the Jewish hatred of Roman rule. The situation finally became so explosive that the local Roman forces were no longer able to contain it and Cestius Gallus, governor of Syria, moved against Jerusalem with stronger forces to maintain Roman control. After setting fire to Bezetha, North of the temple, Gallus encamped in front of the royal palace, South-West of the temple. At that moment, Josephus says, he could have easily forced his way into the city; his delay, however, strengthened the insurgents. The advance units of the Romans then made a protective covering, like the back of the tortoise, with their shields over themselves & began undermining the walls. Again when the Romans were about to succeed, they withdrew in the fall of 66 C.E. Concerning this withdrawal, Josephus says: \u201cCestius . . . suddenly recalled his troops, renounced his hopes, without having suffered any reverse &, contrary to all calculation, retired from the city.\u201d (The Jewish War, II, 540 [xix, 7]) This attack on the city, followed by the sudden withdrawal, furnished the signal & the opportunity for the Christians there to \u2018flee to the mountains\u2019 as instructed by Jesus. - Luke 21:20-22. The next year (67 C.E.) Vespasian set about putting down the Jewish uprising, but Nero\u2019s unexpected death in 68 opened the way for Vespasian to become emperor. So he returned to Rome in 69 & left his son Titus to continue the campaign, & the next year, 70 C.E., Jerusalem was entered & destroyed. Three years later the last Jewish stronghold at Masada fell to the Romans. Josephus says that during the whole campaign against Jerusalem 1,100,000 Jews died, many from pestilence & famine, & 97,000 were taken captive, he says, many being scattered as slaves to all quarters of the empire. - The Jewish War, VI, 420 (ix, 3). All 12 tribes were united in their support of David\u2019s son Solomon in his kingship. But upon his death in about 998 B.C.E. the second dividing of the kingdom occurred. Only the tribes of Benjamin & Judah supported King Rehoboam, who sat on his father Solomon\u2019s throne in Jerusalem. Israel, consisting of the ten other tribes to the North & East, picked Jeroboam to be their king. - 1Ki 11:29-37; 12:1-24. At first the capital of Israel was set up at Shechem. Later it was moved to Tirzah, & then during the reign of Omri it was moved to Samaria, where it remained for the next 200 years. (1Ki 12:25; 15:33; 16:23, 24) Jeroboam recognised that unified worship holds a people together, & so to keep the breakaway tribes from going to Jerusalem\u2019s temple to worship, he set up two golden calves, not at the capital, but at the two extremities of Israel\u2019s territory, one at Bethel in the south & the other at Dan in the North. He also installed a non-Levitical priesthood to lead & instruct Israel in worship of both the golden calves & the goat-shaped demons.\u20141Ki 12:28-33; 2Ch 11:13-15. In Jehovah\u2019s eyes this was a very great sin that Jeroboam committed. (2Ki 17:21, 22) Had he remained faithful to Jehovah & not turned to such rank idolatry, God would have allowed his dynasty to continue, but as it turned out, his house lost the throne when his son Nadab was assassinated less than two years after Jeroboam\u2019s death. - 1Ki 11:38; 15:25-28. As the ruler went, so went the nation of Israel. Nineteen kings, not counting Tibni (1Ki 16:21, 22), reigned from 997 to 740 B.C.E. Only nine had their own sons succeed them, & only one had a dynasty extending to the fourth generation. Seven of Israel\u2019s kings ruled two years or less; some for only a few days. One committed suicide, four others met a premature death, & six others were assassinated by ambitious men who then occupied the throne of their victims. Whereas the best of the whole lot, Jehu, pleased Jehovah by removing the vile Baal worship that Ahab & Jezebel had sponsored, yet \u201cJehu himself did not take care to walk in the law of Jehovah the God of Israel with all his heart\u201d; he allowed Jeroboam\u2019s calf worship to continue throughout the land. - 2Ki 10:30, 31. Jehovah, for his part, was certainly long-suffering with Israel. During their 257-year history he continued to send his servants to warn the rulers & the people of their wicked ways, but to no avail. (2Ki 17:7-18) Among these devoted servants of God were the prophets Jehu (not the king), Elijah, Micaiah, Elisha, Jonah, Oded, Hosea, Amos & Micah. - 1Ki 13:1-3; 16:1, 12; 17:1; 22:8; 2Ki 3:11, 12; 14:25; 2Ch 28:9; Hosea 1:1; Amos 1:1; Micah 1:1. Israel\u2019s problem of protecting herself against invasion was greater than Judah\u2019s, for though she had double the population, she also had nearly triple the land area to guard. In addition to warring against Judah from time to time, she was frequently at war on her Northern & Eastern frontiers with Syria & under pressure from Assyria. The final siege of Samaria was begun by Shalmaneser V in the seventh year of Hoshea\u2019s reign, but it took nearly three years before the city was taken by the Assyrians in 740 B.C.E. - 2Ki 17:1-6; 18:9, 10. The policy of the Assyrians, inaugurated by Shalmaneser\u2019s predecessor Tiglath-pileser III, was to remove captives from conquered territory & transplant in their place peoples from other parts of the empire. Thus, future uprisings were discouraged. In this instance the other national groups brought into Israel\u2019s territory eventually became intermingled both racially & religiously & were known thereafter as Samaritans. - 2Ki 17:24-33; Ezra 4:1, 2, 9, 10; Luke 9:52; John 4:7-43. With the fall of Israel the ten northern tribes were not completely lost, however. Some persons of these tribes evidently were left in Israel\u2019s territory by the Assyrians. Others no doubt fled from Israel\u2019s idolatry to Judah\u2019s territory prior to 740 B.C.E., & their descendants would have been among the captives taken to Babylon in 607 B.C.E. (2Ch 11:13-17; 35:1, 17-19) No doubt there were descendants also from among those taken captive by the Assyrians (2Ki 17:6; 18:11) who were numbered among the returning remnant that made up the 12 tribes of Israel in 537 B.C.E. & thereafter. - 1Ch 9:2, 3; Ezra 6:17; Hosea 1:11; compare Ezekiel 37:15-22. Samaria could hold remnants of the 10 Israelite tribes! ",

            "answer_text": "A very pertinent question for today to be sure. The new Israelite\u2019s are those as described in the Book of Revelation: Revelation 7:4\u20138 NIV 4 Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel. 5 From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben 12,000, from the tribe of Gad 12,000, 6 from the tribe of Asher 12,000, from the tribe of Naphtali 12,000, from the tribe of Manasseh 12,000, 7 from the tribe of Simeon 12,000, from the tribe of Levi 12,000, from the tribe of Issachar 12,000, 8 from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000, from the tribe of Joseph 12,000, from the tribe of Benjamin 12,000. The question is, are these ALL natural born Jews?? Revelation again defines this and states NOT. While some like the apostles and early disciples were Jews by birth the entire 144,000 includes some from \u201cthe nations\u201d, such as the Roman Cornelius and his family. (See Acts 10, entire Chapter) Revelation 5:9\u201310 NIV 9 And they sang a new song, saying: \u201cYou are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals,because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation.10 You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.\u201d This fulfills a statement made by John the Baptist regarding the \u201csons of Abraham\u201d, the natural born Jews: Mathew 3:7\u20139 NIV 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them: \u201cYou brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 8 Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. 9 And do not think you can say to yourselves, \u2018We have Abraham as our father.\u2019 I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. Those taken from the nations and adopted as children of Abraham, Israelite's, are the \u201cstones\u201d mentioned in this prophecy. P.S. No one today of Jewish decent can determine what \u201cTribe\u201d they are descendant from as all those records were lost in 70 AD when the Romans burned the Temple, its contents and the genealogical records destroyed.
