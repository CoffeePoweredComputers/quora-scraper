            "answer_text": "There are two tracks - the first is to learn history. Not only the battles but the why of wars. The study of nations and the individuals who begin wars. Then there is the second track. The memoirs of people who fought the wars. The men and women who participated in the harsh reality of the wars others started. I would say, also, talk to veterans. Yea, yea ignore the politics but listen to the stories and though they may be \u201ccolored\u201d by time you may be surprised what you will learn. ",
