            "answer_text": "Rather than point out that Hinduism and Ancient Egyptian religion are older, I\u2019d note instead the question is ethnocentric: other cultures have also had religions, and those disappear into the mists. An example: typical Native American belief was in a Great Spirit. The sun and the moon are eyes, just like in other religions in other parts of the world. These arose either from looking at the same thing or because an idea spread from somewhere and it worked so well that everyone adopted a version of it as the baseline conception for spiritual existence. Spontaneous means like when you watch Wheel of Fortune and some million people all get the answer at almost the same second as the letters appear: we\u2019re conditioned by prior learning, which fits to our capabilities as people, to figure that out. Neat thing is we take different pathways: some work from the category toward phrases they\u2019ve already honed in on (and thus may \u2018get lucky\u2019 some time), while others build sounds, while others look for consonant patterns, etc. And yet all these pathways tend to arrive at the answer at around the same time. You can test this at home by watching Wheel. As an aside: To me, the lesson in this is that we\u2019ve misunderstood the concept of monotheism all along (with the exception one could argue of Judaism): it\u2019s not that there\u2019s one God but that there\u2019s one answer and multiple paths to that. Christianity gets that dead wrong with it\u2019s stuff about the only path to the father is through the son, while the Qur\u2019an gets it more correct, saying for example that the Jews have their book and this is \u2018ours\u2019. Judaism says that this is a specific covenant, meaning a pathway that goes back and forth (one hopes), but that has been taken over by other religions and used to say that Judaism claims an exclusivity and universality that it does not. Example would be: if you\u2019re not a halachic Jew, then you really don\u2019t need to keep kosher, and that\u2019s your business because you\u2019re not required to keep kosher unless you are a halachic Jew. So if you\u2019re talking about \u2018first religion\u2019, you run into a ton of complexity because all religions descend in some way from religions that we can only identify by talking about the symbolism. So for example the Osiris story is extremely old. The religious content is clearer if you simplify: the male is torn to pieces and then rebuilt by the females. That\u2019s a version of an Eden story in which the female \u2018Eve\u2019 builds a more aware male \u2018Adam\u2019. We tend to think of the Garden stories as train stops on the way to a big religion instead of as representing how people saw awareness of being human develop, all the way back to where they could imagine themselves as less aware, less human, until they become animals. That conception of \u2018savage\u2019 survived through the centuries: Caesar describes the barbarian \u2018furor\u2019 of the Celts painted for battle and, heaven knows, Wagner\u2019s operas rely on the conception. A class system depends on the idea that some people are genuinely lesser. These all draw shades of awareness out of raw \u2018I\u2019ll attack and eat you because I\u2019m a predator and you\u2019re prey\u2019. Humans saw that. My guess is that glimmer was the spark that made us \u2018human\u2019, which means the glimmer was followed unconsciously and only became something they could be aware of over time. If that sounds odd, mathematicians take for granted that someone can have an insight into a problem, into a relationship or form, though that glimmer may well take centuries to bring into focus. That\u2019s why an idea stays valuable or even grows in estimation. This locates, to me, on the feminine side because females carry eggs, bear the young, and physically feed them. This means females tend to look ahead, to evaluate and connect present actions to future needs. I\u2019m not saying men don\u2019t, though impulse in men, particularly young men, is perhaps the great behavioral problem of all time, but that men provide fertilizer and don\u2019t even need to be there after that. The story of awareness is in many ways the \u2018capture\u2019 of the male by the female for the benefit of both. Religion has lost that aspect as it became more explicitly the male perspective on creation. As in, Adam says \u2018she made me do it\u2019 to an Eve who is created asexually so she isn\u2019t his mother but instead comes out of the male. That mimics ejaculation - the ultimate male perspective sayeth the penis - switched to the rib that is closest to the heart, so you see the connection is through feeling, emotion, need and yet the story is not told from the female\u2019s side.

Idols are a clear indication of organized religion, and a professional at making idols suggests religions of some complexity and size in order that their services would be necessary. All of which predated even the patriarch of all of Judaism. * A midrash is an anecdote taught by the Rabbis about a Tanach-era event, usually with a particular moral or message. ",
