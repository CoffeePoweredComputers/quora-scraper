In Northern Ireland, abortion is illegal unless there are abnormalities with the foetus.   So women from the Republic of Ireland travel to N. Ireland to have abortions due to foetal abnormalities. Women from both the Republic of Ireland and N. Ireland travel to mainland UK to have all other types of abortion.  *There seems to be endless confusion at what constitutes a mothers life being at risk. ",

            "answer_text": "Because the people voted to introduce a complete ban on abortion into the constitution in 1983. Although abortion was already illegal the pro-lifers were afraid that it might be introduced by legislation and so, with the strong support of the Roman Catholic Church, they pressured the government to have a referendum on the issue. It was passed with ease. It was the first political campaign I took part in. We lost. ",
