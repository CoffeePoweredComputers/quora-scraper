            "answer_text": "There might be two questions here: Why did the Industrial Revolution start in Britain? Or, Why did the Industrial Revolution start in Britain before some other countries? One of the problems with answering a question about technology is the fact that most developments occur almost simultaneously in different countries. If the question is about the development of radar, then the British always claimed that they\u2019d invented it. They did, but Germany was also inventing it at the same time. The telephone? Alexander Graham Bell or Elisha Gray, or maybe someone else. The motor car. Well everybody knows that Carl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler invented the motor car. Or did they? Nicholas Cugnot, a French artillery officer invented the world\u2019s first self-propelled road vehicle around a 100 years earlier. Mind you, it was steam powered. In the late 17th Century there were sociological and societal changes happening. The end of the Absolute Monarchy and the development of education that moved a little further from the religious and philosophical and closer to the scientific. Much of the early development of industry was due to someone asking the question: \u201cCan I do this any faster or cheaper?\u201d Once there was one development, especially in the textile industry in Lancashire, it produced an imbalance elsewhere. For instance, if it took 10 people to spin enough yarn for one weaver, then the spinning needed to be accelerated. Once the Spinning Jenny was introduced and that happened there became a need to increase the rate of weaving. Most of this activity took place in the home and was mainly carried out by the wives and daughters of men who worked the land, but the extra income became marginalised once these machines were introduced, and it soon became obvious that they were too big for a small cottage. If they become too big, then you have to find somewhere to put them, as well as having to find an alternative to powering them. The spinner\u2019s or weaver\u2019s foot became inadequate, so you might use an animal or water power instead. Once steam power became available, not only did the output increase but it became obvious that if you made it capable of driving a large amount of looms, then, if you make the steam engine more powerful you needed somewhere even bigger to put it.  The mills in the north of England eventually became buildings of five or six floors, each floor of several thousand square feet. The boiler may have been in the cellars and driving, via leather belts, the machinery on the floors above. The more cloth you weave, the more thread you need. In addition, the more cloth you weave, the more you need to send to your customers. When the Duke of Bridgewater built the canal he named after himself in 1761 it eventually stretched for 39 miles, or around 65kms, and enabled coal to be brought to the mills, which meant that they could become bigger, with bigger steam engines. This brought on a century of canal building, culminating in the Manchester Ship Canal at the end of the 19th Century which meant that Manchester became the 3rd busiest port in Britain, despite being over 35 miles from the sea. If you\u2019re carrying coal in barges, hauled by horses, it would become evident after a while that you could dispense with the horse and power the barge with a steam engine instead. In which case it became a fairly short step to making a bigger barge, but this time made of iron. I would say that this was a pattern that developed throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Simply put, if you make it possible to weave more cloth, then you need to increase the amount of thread to make it with. If the method for this is larger machines and larger buildings, then the result is you need methods of delivering more raw materials to the mills and more of their product to their customers. More barges means more and longer canals, more locks and more bridges. How do you make bridges to cross navigable waterways such as rivers or canals? You make them out of iron. Lock sides are made out of stone. How do you get the stone around the country? Well, you could put it in barges. In short, the more you produce, the more you have to move. After barges came the railways. The world\u2019s first railways station was at Liverpool Road in Manchester. Once you\u2019ve built big mills, you have to have somewhere for the workers to live, which prompted an increase in house building in towns. Have a look at the amount of bricks in the average small house; then have a look at a typical mill from the 19th century. Cotton mill - Wikipedia Cotton mill - Wikipedia Much of the Industrial Revolution was a matter of one development leading to another, each one a bit bigger or a bit faster than the one before. More and bigger brickworks, more and longer roads, canals and railways. More steel for rails, more wrought iron for bridges, more hardcore for roads and rail beds, more locomotives, more barges, and, as the Empire expanded, more ships. The ironbridge in Shropshire, opened in 1781. The Menai suspension bridge in North Wales, opened in 1855. The Clifton Suspension bridge near Bristol, opened in 1864. The Cadishead Viaduct over the Manchester Ship Canal in 1892. These are just some examples of early iron bridges that helped propel the Industrial Revolution. There was also the matter of increasing populations in urban areas. The population of cities like London, Birmingham, Manchester and others led to more house building, more road building and more railways. Not only that, but all those people needed clean drinking water and their effluent disposing of. Although by no means the first place to wrestle with the problems of clean drinking water and sewage disposal, Britain was the first to try and deal with it in what was the world\u2019s biggest city; London. Other cities had the same problems, which is why for much of the 19th Century more people in cities drank beer than water, including children. The reason for this was that the water used in beer was boiled as part of the brewing process. So began the process of trying to provide clean drinking water as well as getting sewage away from built up area. Although I\u2019m pretty certain that the first place to treat sewage chemically was in the eastern USA. As more wealth was created, especially in provincial towns and cities, so more was used philanthropically to build parks and civic buildings, and, educational facilitites. The University of Manchester was founded in 1824 and benefitted much from bequests from wealthy industrialists. John Dalton was a physicist born in the North West of England who spent most of his life in Manchester and became famous in scientific circles for his atomic theory, research into colour blindness, one particular type of which was named Daltonism in honour of his work. James Prescott Joule was a physicist born in Salford near Manchester in 1818 and his work led to the Law of Conservation of Energy which led to the First Law of Thermodynamics in 1841. He also worked with William Thomson, later known as Lord Kelvin who is known for determining absolute zero, the Kelvin scale is still used today, and among other things was heavily involved with some of the world\u2019s first undersea cables, including the ones under the Atlantic. Both of these men were contemporaries of Michael Farday who was born in 1791, probably who\u2019s most famous experiment resulted in the Farday Cage. Versions of this are still used to protect people outside MRI scan rooms and can be used to protect debit and credit cards from scammers. It is used in microwave ovens, usually seen on the door, and if your TV or computer uses coaxial cable or USB cables then the shielding acts in a similar way. The term farad is used as a measurement of capacitance even today. Put the names Stephenson, Trevithick, Telford and Brunel together with those above, and perhaps this gives an idea how Britain stayed ahead, technologically, as its international rivals developed more and more. The wealthier the country became, the more the philanthropists put into universities and research. It also might be worth bearing in mind that foreigners also had a role to play. Charles Beyer was a German engineer who came to Manchester and whose name is synonymous with the Beyer Peacock locomotive factory and who produced some of the largest locos ever built, especially for markets in Africa and Australia. In addition to highly educated foreigners, the presence of Huguenots, including some of my own ancestors, brought new skills. It\u2019s been estimated that around 25% of London\u2019s population has Huguenot ancestry. Italians, including some of my own ancestors played a huge role in the development of the country as did the relatively small populations of Jews. Freidrich Engels was a Manchester resident for several years and wrote one of his seminal works, The Condition of the Working Class in England while living there in 1845. While not exactly an endorser of capitalism, his was still an important influence in the development of the country. At some stage earlier, I used the phrase \u201cin short\u201d, well I failed at that, but, to recap: Technology made more efficient spinning and weaving machines, which needed more raw materials, bigger buildings which needed huge quantities of brick and large numbers of people to work there who needed thousands of houses which, needed huge amounts of brick. The amount of raw material and coal to fire the boilers needed canals and barges to move it all to the mills. This needed canals and barges, roads and horse drawn wagons, railway lines and trains and rolling stock to move it to the markets. Steel for railways tracks, timber for the sleepers (ties) and ballast to support the sleepers. The trains themselves needed iron and timber. Bridges had to be built of iron to cross the rivers and canals, and in some cases this meant rail bridges to cross railway lines and canal aqueducts to cross other canals and rivers. Britain had also become an aggressive trading nation and made the most use of its Empire, providing not only goods such as tea, coffee, silk, spices, gold, diamonds, minerals and meat for the mother country, but also a ready market for machinery, ships and skilled personnel. Since WWII however, the rest of the world has caught up, and in many cases surpassed the former leader. Maybe Britain can\u2019t evolve much further, and now it\u2019s the turn of other countries, but if the conditions are right, and they were in the 17th, 18th and 19th Centuries in Britain, that\u2019s maybe why the country was able to excel the way it did.

            "answer_text": "The term \u201cindustrial revolution\u201d has long been used to identify the period roughly from 1750 to 1825, during which the accelerated application of mechanical principles, including steam power, to manufacturing in Great Britain produced an identifiable change in economic structure and growth. The invention of the Steam Engine during 1710 was an important stepping stone for the Industrial Revolution. And needless to say, the Steam Engine was invented in Britain. There were also a number of other inventions which took place in Britain that contributed to its Industrial superiority. To understand why the IR started in Europe (Britain) and not any other it is important to know the economic and political history around the period which I have summarized in following sections: - A Short history of world's economy before 1750s- The British advantage- A Short history of world's economy and politics after 1750s  A Short history of the world's economy before 1750s: The period 600-1450 C.E. was known as the 'post classical era' and is identified with spread of major religions, rise of civilizations, etc and the next era 1450-1750 C.E. known as 'the age of exploration' saw the beginning of long distance trade development between the eastern and western hemisphere. During the 16th century, Europeans developed an economic system called ' Mercantilism'. It is based on the idea of a country exporting more than they import to make more money. For this the countries need a market that wants to buy large amounts of their goods.  Now European nations, in order to create this market, created colonies and established territories where they attempted to generate a market for certain goods. So, European merchants\u2019 main role in Asian trade was transporting goods from one Asian country to another market in Asia or the Indian Ocean region. This is what the world's political map looked like at the time:    As can be observed in above map, Africa and America were all colonies of the European Nations. While the Europeans had small trade empires in some parts of Asia, most of Asia remained independent or under the rule of Non-Europeans. Nevertheless, the Europeans were also one of the most advanced civilizations of the time. India, during this time was ruled by the Mughals and had a very strong economy. Agriculture, Manufacturing and Trade were the main stay of the economy. Asian (Indian and Chinese) agriculture was producing harvests twenty times the amount of seed planted, while European harvests were only eight times or less. Asians were not leaving land lie fallow as were the Europeans to get more harvests from the same track of land. India's textile workers in the 1700s also had a standard of living equal to that of British workers, mostly due to India's agriculture, paying less for food raised standards of living. It is however believed that weakening  of the Indian economy had started as early as the 1700s, when factional rivalries and warfare within the ruling Mughal dynasty were fragmenting its Islamic empire. In 1750, India was still producing 24.5 percent of the world's manufactured goods. Britain, on the other hand was only producing 1.9% of the world's manufactured goods.  The British advantage: There were advantages the British had that helped them maintain a dominant position over Asia (particularly India) and the world during the Industrial Era: 1. 200 years of colonization led to massive accumulation of capital. From 1500 to 1800, Mexico and Peru produced 85 percent of the world's silver. That silver was sent around the world by the Europeans (including the British) as a way to pay for foreign goods. 2.  Scientific Revolution. Western scientific progress was built upon a foundation ofthree key technological discoveries, that changed man's ability to control the natural world, these were printing, gunpowder, and the magnet.  By 1700 there were scientific institutions across Britain.  Additionally, a commitment to science as the firm basis for success in commerce and industry, and for national prosperity, was established in the political agenda. 3. Industrial Revolution. The world\u2019s first factories were being built in Britain during the time of the revolution. In textile manufacturing, particularly cotton, the British had an advantage in steam power which was lacking in Asia and other parts of the world. The Industrial revolution was important not only for textile, but the advances in roads, transportation, agriculture, communication. this was certainly a boom for Europe especially Britain to go ahead of the rest of the world.  A Short history of the world's economy and politics after 1750s: The Industrial Revolution in the rest of the world: One of the reasons why Britain was the first country to Industrialize was 'the influence of enlightenment'. The other was the rich deposits of iron and coal. Great Britain\u2019s geography, financial system, political stability, and natural resources also helped to the developing of the so called industrial revolution viz., said to have begun in the 'late 1700s' after a long history of innovation and discovery by pioneering scientists, engineers and manufacturers. After a while Britain applied restrictions to mechanics, toolmakers, and engineers to leave the country. This way they could stop the others from evolving for a period of time, making Britain the most powerful nation in the time. In the rest of Europe industrialization was delayed to various reasons. Troubles sparked by the French revolution and the Napoleonic wars between 1789-1815 had halted trade, interrupted communications, and caused inflation in some parts of the continent. Even in countries where agriculture dominated, pockets of industrializations arose. So, even during the 1800s industrialization proceeded by region rather than by country. On the other hand, for a variety of reasons, many European countries did not industrialize at all. In some nations, social structure delayed the adaptations of new methods of productions and the accidents of geography held back others. The United Statespossessed the same resources as Britain, rich deposits of coal and iron ore, fast-flowing rivers and the huge mass of farm workers needed. Therefore, Great Britain blockaded them after the war of 1812; so they had to use their own resources and to develop their own independent industries. Moreover, Great Britain had forbidden engineer, mechanics and toolmakers to leave the country; but in 1789, however, a young British mill maker, Samuel Slater, immigrated to the United States. There, he built a spinning machine from memory. Then Moses Brown opened the first factory in the United States to house Slater\u00b4s machines in Pawtucket, Rhone Island. In 1813, Francis Cavot Lowell mechanized every stage in the manufacture of cloth. It is said that after the loss of the American colonies in 1776, Britain built a \"Second British Empire\", based in colonies in India, Asia, Australia, Canada. The crown jewel was India, where in 1750s a private British company, with its own army, the East India Company (or \"John Company\"), took control of part of India. In India, despite the country having resources and market for development of mechanization and Industrialization, it is believed that India did not have as many people as Britain did who were eager for new ways of doing things. In Britain, competition, interest in profit and engineering were inspiring more economic progress.  For example: India's cotton growers were not as motivated by personal gain as were Southern planters in the US (who were encouraged by financiers in New England who made money shipping cotton abroad).  Also cotton growing in India was inhibited by the Zamindar land tenure system where an aristocrat held a huge tract of land and control over peasants whom he could tax. Local princes and the Brahmans around these princes were also said to have had little interested in investing in 'technological change'.  But most importantly, there is also no historic evidence to show that Britain was willing to sell or share its technology with the Asian country. Rather, the emphasis was on utilizing India as a market for British manufactured goods. The story of India's colonization and economic weakening started around 1700s, when factional rivalries and warfare within the ruling Mughal dynasty were fragmenting its Islamic empire.  In the east a Mughal prince, Siraj-ud-Daula, in April 1756, succeeded to the throne of a piece of the old empire and demanded that the British destroy their defenses at Calcutta. The British refused. Allied with the East India Company in Calcutta at the time were Hindu bankers and merchants who found security in Britain's support for free enterprise and rights of private property. They supported a pretender to power, Mir Jafar, to replace Siraj-ud-Daula. The East India Company became the power behind the throne in Bengal, and began taking responsibility for collecting taxes and maintaining law and order in Calcutta and from Bihar in the northwest to Orissa in the southwest. Company men bullied their way into dominating the trading of salt, opium, tobacco, timber and in boat building. The British East India Co. continued to trade gold & silver for cotton, silk, tea while taking over most lands of India. When Mir Jaffer also demanded some limits on commercial activities by company, he was described as unfit to govern and replaced. Eventually, his replacement, Mir Kasim, tried to acquire independence from company rule, and, in 1763, a war was fought against his supporters, won by the company. After 1840 Britain is believed to have abandoned mercantilism and practice \"free trade,\" with no tariffs or quotas or restrictions and powerful Royal Navy protected its global holdings.  Yet around 1858, the British declared India a colony and began modernizing its ports, roads, railroads, telegraph while also dismantling India's textile industry that was in direct competition to the developing British textile industry.  By first forcing India to accept free trade, then British  factory-owners who had learnt the techniques of machine spinning and weaving, imported cheap raw cotton from the American plantations and made finished cloth from British mills which was much cheaper than the Indian handloom products and sold it in India. Indian spinners and weavers of course started to lose their jobs, and had to turn to agriculture to make a living. Living standards in India deteriorated while between 1870 and 2000, economic output per head of population in Britain rose by 500%, generating a significant rise in living standards. This is what the world's political map looked like by this time:   The French and British in particular had colonized most of Africa, America, Australia and Asia (India only). This answer deliberately leaves out discussing China (and Russia) which were not colonized but still remained un-industrialized during this period. Why China did not industrialize is long discussion and calls for a separate answer. ",
