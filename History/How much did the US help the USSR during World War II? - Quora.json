            "answer_text": "The most important contribution of the U.S.A. in the war in Europe wasn\u2019t the Lend-lease, but the millions of soldiers and tens of thousands of vehicles, planes and ships they sent on the continent. In 1942 the American contribution wasn\u2019t decisive (except at sea) but in 1943 the might of the U.S.A. was clearly felt by the Axis. This had a decisive impact in the Eastern Front, because to cope with the U.S. buildup the Germans had to weaken their forces fighting versus the U.S.S.R.  U.S. troops landing at Omaha Beach, June 6, 1944 The following tables make it clear: % of German divisions (Heer & Waffen SS) against the USSR (June of each year) [1] 1941: 71% (149/209 late June - early July)1942: 80% (187/235)1943: 69% (194/282) - that\u2019s the effect of the fall of Italy1944: 54% (158/294) - D-Day1945: 65% (178/276 in April)% of frontline German divisions (Heer & Waffen SS) against the U.S.S.R (December of each year) [2] 1941: 98% (97% of Panzer and motorised divs.)1942: 97% (89%)1943: 93% (85%)1944: 64% (71%) The fall of the Reichstag, battle of Berlin, May 1945 % of the Luftwaffe against the U.S.S.R. [3] 1941: 66% (3.094 planes/4.709 - June)1942: 50% (2.796/5.676 - July) - the U.S.A.A.F. arrives in Europe1943: 36% (2.133/6.630 - May) - the LW loses many planes in the Med1944: 33% (2.383/7.265 - May) - Operation Argument1945: 36% (2.080/5.847 - January) The P-51, the plane that broke the back of the Luftwafe % of the German war production in the East (incl. everything: bullets, shells, trucks, planes, submarines, etc): [4] 1941: ~70-75%1942: ~65%1943: ~55-60%1944: ~35-40%1945: ~40-45%The Lend-lease was a less significant contribution (the L-L to the U.S.S.R. amounted for only 4% of the U.S. military spending during WW2, not including transport costs [5]) but it was still very important for the Soviets. Their economy was badly mauled by the German attack and they absolutely needed help to recover. If we add U.S. and British L-L deliveries with Soviet war production, then in total the L-L amounted for: [6] Gunpowder: 33% (for bullets, bombs, shells\u2026)Trucks: 56,9%Cars: 76,9%Tires: 30,1%Avgas: 59% (the Soviets had tons of oil but modest refining capacity)Copper: 45,2% (used for electric cables, ammunition & motor engines)Aluminium: 55,5% (for aircrafts & motor engines production)Sugar: 29,5% Meat: 15,1% (nearly 3 millions Soviet citizens died of starvation during WWII in non-occupied area) U.S. postcard commemorating the Lend-lease act Overall the U.S. and British L-L increased by 7\u20137,5% the Soviet GNP during WWII [7]. Most of the L-L came from the U.S, and most of it arrived in 1943\u201344\u201345. The U.S. intervention was needed by the U.S.S.R because in 1941\u201342 the Soviets were losing troops at an unbearable rate. Here is the \u201cirrecoverable losses\u201d (dead + missing) ratio between the Axis and the U.S.S.R. during the war: [8] 1941: 12,2:1 (5/6:1 incl. WIA) - the Sovs are surprised by Barbarossa1942: 5:11943: 3,3:1 - the U.S. troops & materiel arrive en masse in Europe1944: 1:1 - D-Day1945: 1:2 (around 1:1 incl. WIA) Allies and Axis frontline strength 1941\u201345 The S-U had only a 2,45:1 population advantage against Germany (196m vs 80m), reduced to 1,6:1 after Barbarossa and the loss of huge swaths of territory (126m vs 80m). The ever-decreasing size of the Ostheer and the Lend-Lease helped the Soviets to increase their combat efficiency. The huge amount of gunpowder provided allowed the Red Army to make good use of his numerical superiority in artillery tubes and the numerous trucks and cars allowed the Soviets generals to put in application their deep-battle doctrine.

            "answer_text": "Lend-Lease helped the USSR a lot. The US provided the USSR with several hundred thousand trucks. The Red Army used these to great effect in Operation Bagration, which possibly the greatest Allied victory of World War II.The Allied bombing of Germany drew the Luftwaffe away from attacking the Red Army to defending German airspace which gave the Soviets air supremacy in the last years of World War II.The Nazis at times had up to 80% of their troops facing the Red Army and never had less than two thirds facing it. However Allied participation in the war, including the American participation, reduced the number of German divisions that the Soviets were facing. The Eastern front collapsed even faster than it would have because the Nazis withdrew so many of their divisions to the west for the Ardennes offensive.",
