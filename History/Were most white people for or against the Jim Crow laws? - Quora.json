            "answer_text": "The best way I have ever heard if explained is, \u201cDoes a fish realize they are living in water?\u201d Most people, White, African-American or otherwise who grew up with these laws just thought it was the way things are. I went to a segregated high school (in the 1980s!) and classmates with whom I talk don\u2019t even realize that it was segregated. They say, \u201cNo there were almost no Blacks or Hispanics in the school because they lived in different school boundaries.\u201d I point out that the Hispanic neighborhood less than a 1/2 mile from our school magically ended up in the boundary of a school 10 miles away. Meanwhile, a White neighborhood 5 miles away was within the boundary of our school. When I was very young, my mother would just as a matter of fact say, \u201cPeople like us don\u2019t eat there,\u201d about certain restaurants. Another thing that younger Quora readers may not realize is that the definition of \u201cWhite\u201d was very narrow. My family was primarily from Eastern Europe and I am fifth generation in the United States on that side of the family (and 20 to a hundred generations on the other). We were still not \u201cWhite.\u201d Neither were people whose ancestors were from Asia, Spain, Ireland, Italy, etc. At least as far as being allowed in clubs, hotels and restaurants or buying homes in certain neighborhoods. Again, we often just thought that was the natural order of things. ",

            "answer_text": "What I remember was that white people appreciated the Jim row Laws much more than they opposed them. The Law gave \u201cpriority\u201d or \u201c privilege\u201d to them so why wouldn\u2019t they want to keep those laws around? What I recall vividly is the bathrooms were free for white people and the colored bathroom, no matter it was segregated had a lockable implement on the doors and if you wanted to use the bathroom, you paid a dime. I was very young but I do know that there seating privilege on the buses, in the restaurants, and the cinemas. Some establishments, you weren\u2019t welcome in to eat at all such as Woolworth thus offering white clientele sole business. People in general want to be held in higher esteem then the next guy. Even if they don\u2019t admit it. ",
