            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cWhen will the modern Catholic Church collapse and why?\u201d Good question. I think about it often. However, I sense impatience; that is not wise. We should be thinking not of the events outside of our control, \u2014 so-called eschatological events, \u2014 but of our own, personal demise. When will I collapse? And more importantly, in what condition will my soul be when I collapse? Will I have a good death? Will a priest be nearby? These thoughts are good to have; the Church recommends we think often of the The Last Things and apply them to ourselves. It is also wise to pray to Our Lady, because she is, really, our church, and she won\u2019t collapse. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us, sinners, now and in the hour of our death. But I digress. Your question is formed with precision. \u201cWhen will the modern Catholic Church collapse?\u201d That is an important distinction, for the Church in her essence cannot collapse any more than Mary can collapse, or Christ can cancel His death and resurrection. You understand, no doubt, that the Catholic Church exists outside of time and space: it is a supernatural force, that connects us across time to the foot of His Cross and the Empty Tomb; it gives us fellowship of Christ on His throne of majesty; it united us with the Holy Apostles and the first martyrs for the faith, and all Christ\u2019s saints through the ages. It is not collapsible. At the same time the modern Church, \u2014 that is, the Church post Vatican II, or the 15th century German Church that was a breeding ground for the Protestant Reformation, \u2014 is an institution of fallible men, so she may fail. Not in the eternal sense but in temporal sense. She failed to hold Northern Europe in unity of faith. Earlier, she failed to hold Byzantium and Russia in the unity of faith, she failed to sustain the military struggle of the Crusades to liberate the Promised Land. Schisms and surrender are failures of the Church. \u201cCollapse\u201d is too strong a word, because the Holy Spirit leads the Church out of every disaster our bishops drive her into. The Great Eastern Schism of 1054 becomes a gift to us today, because as we in the West mangle our liturgy, the Greeks preserved for us the splendid Church of antiquity and early Middle Ages. If Protestantism had never had a chance to develop its theological fantasies, there will forever be a temptation to fall into declarative, effortless faith of \u201ctotal depravity\u201d of man and of \u201cirresistible grace\u201d, \u2014 these are easy, entry-level theologies that come back to tempt us now and again. Having tried them we know where we ought not to go. The concern for the Modern Church is very real. That we survived the Eastern Schism, and the false popes, and the Protestant Reformation does not guarantee that we shall survive modernity without some rather fundamental change. It is entirely possible that the Church will shrink to a very small faithful kernel. The triumph over the Gates of Hell is certain; how many will persevere to the end is not known. Christ said: yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth? (Luke 18:8) These words cannot be dismissed. True, He is asking rather than prophesying, He just spoke of God avenging His Elect in the previous verse. He is not going to abandon us. But His words are spoken for us to hear. Many are losing their faith because of our faithless clergy, poor catechisis, organized Atheism. One American bishop once commented that he is about to end his days in his bed, but his successor is likely to end his days in prison, and his successor\u2019s successor is likely to end up executed. These are not unfounded fears, and at the root of this condition is the failure of the Modern Church. Pope St. Pius X outlined the failures of the Modern Church; they are many and his encyclical is long. Here is my outline: Alex Pismenny's answer to Who is the most conservative pope? Later, Pope Benedict XVI summarized the problems of the Modern Church in three words: \u201cdictatorship of relativism\u201d. This is where we get theology of personalized faith that is plaguing Catholics today. We now got ourselves a pope who, when he is not busy covering up for faithless clergy, chats with the press about how he is \u201cnot one to judge\u201d and how for all he knows, an Atheist can get to heaven just fine. For him, I pray often. The keys that he is holding better be dropped and picked up by someone. Maybe, his aging predecessor?  But these are day-dreams. The Modern Church is not going to leave the scene voluntarily; she is not going to collapse, of course. She is going to phase out. In a generation or two. As every conservative Catholic knows, the Catholic youth is conservative. Best priests are young priests. They have seen the shenanigans of their parents, and they want their Church back: the Church of the Upper Room, the Church of the Catacombs, the Church of the Romans, the Church of the Middle Ages, of the cathedrals and monasteries, of the saints and of the scientists, the sculptors and the iconographers. We are going to be fine \u2014 our grandchildren, that is. The rest should be prepared for rough times ahead. Hold tight.  ",

            "answer_text": "I used to read a lot of the writings of Fr. Andrew Greeley, a priest and a professionally trained sociologist. He made the study of the Church a large part of his life\u2019s work. He found that people raised Catholic might drift away from the Church and stop attending, but they just would not go to other churches. Once raised Catholic, they might not go to services, but they stayed Catholic. And of course, they came back often for milestones. This is a tendency which virtually guarantees that the RCC is not going bust any time soon. They are one of the largest denominations of the assortment of Christian denominations, and probably one of the most literate. Churches whose demise I fully expect are all of the non-denominational churches. The group itself will not go away, of course, but virtually all of the individual churches will experience a period of growth, a period of stability, a period of decline and finally it will be shuttered. This is because while the pain line denominations have a large body of traditions, and experience in dealing with almost any kind of difficulty, the non-denom is out there all alone. Most of them do not have much knowledge, and when some special kind of problem hits, they founder. They also tend to be personality cults, so that when the magical parson who founded the church retires, often that\u2019s the end of the church. I\u2019ve visited a number of RCC parishes. Many of them are quite beautiful and seem to have a very loving atmosphere. I visited one because it is the modern incarnation of a parish my ancestors attended many, many years before. I almost wish I hadn\u2019t come. It was a very sturdy church, but it looked like a business proposition, not a religious setting. Very antiseptic feel. However, when I was visiting was not when a service was scheduled, and I saw a good number of the faithful in the sanctuary, so it\u2019s obviously doing the important things right\u2026 I wonder what people are thinking when they ask if the RCC is going to fail any time soon. The answer is about as certain as one can be at this stage, that such is not going to happen any time soon. There are a number of different denominations, and each of them is doing reasonably well, all things considered. People who do not go to any organized church have experienced a growth phase, and the number of non-believers (agnostics and atheists) has increased so that they are pushing ten per cent. In the recent past, commitment to the church has dropped. Are these the beginning of a trend? Only time will tell. It\u2019s nothing remarkable at this time, certainly, and we have seen rises and drops in these numbers many times in the past. ",

            "answer_text": "They\u2019ve proven very durable, despite generating heretical spin-offs and schisms for most of their 2000 years, so I believe the Catholic Church will be around for a very long time. As to why a collapse might come, when it finally comes: look at examples in history of other churches that disappeared. It will probably be for secular and financial reasons, not by converting people\u2019s hearts. Example: Constantine I made Christianity legal in the Roman Empire in 313. Theodosius I made it the official Roman state religion in 391. For the 78 years in between, there were still several powerful churches in the Empire, including the old pagan state religion and a unitarian (Arian) version of Christianity. In fact, there were both pagan and Arian emperors after Constantine. Theodosius allowed attacks on pagan temples and eventually ordered them closed. He confiscated temple money. He disbanded Rome\u2019s Vestal Virgins. Fortune-telling by examining animal entrails was banned, on pain of death.Unitarian Christians had to turn over their churches to the Orthodox/Catholic Church.Probably most importantly, Theodosius passed a law that unitarian Christians could not make legal wills and could not pass their wealth to their children. It would be taken by the state. No one wanted that.So, one way to end a church is to ruin it financially. At first people will only pretend to give up their old religions, but after a couple of generations the old religion will be gone. There are definitely exceptions, including Christianity and Judaism in Europe, but it has happened often. Arian Christianity continued in non-Roman European kingdoms until the 8th century, but eventually they were all conquered and converted by Catholic Orthodox countries. Of course this is also how all the South and Central American religions died out. The lands were conquered by Christian Spain and Portugal, and the old religions were suppressed by force. ",

            "answer_text": "When will the Catholic Church die? Catholic Church has already lost its credibility. Most churches do not teach the true teachings like Matthew 10:8 \u2018Freely you have received; freely give\u2019; they teach that it is o.k. to reap the financial gifts in exchange of the spiritual gifts and preach the attractive teachings like: \u2018And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified\u2019 Romans 8:30 They try to make people feel happy with such attractive teachings in order to receive more donations. \u201cIf we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?\u201d 1 Corinthians 9:11. Most churches do not follow the strict teachings which urge us to obey God as taught by Jesus in Matthew 22:35-40, Luke 10:25-28, Mark 12:28-34, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like \u2018We are saved by grace through faith apart from works\u2019 - Ephesians 2:8-9 \u2018Even when we were dead in sins, we are saved by grace\u2019 - Ephesians 2:5 \u2018A man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law\u2019 - Romans 3:28 \u2018A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith\u2019 - Galatians 2:16 \u2018For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse\u2019 - Galatians 3:10 Most churches do not follow the strict teachings like If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away which is taught by Jesus in Matthew 18:9, Matthew 5:29 and Mark 9:47, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like: \u2018God has chosen us before the foundations of the world\u2019 - Ephesians 1:4 \u2018God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation\u2019 - 2 Thessalonians 2:13 \u2018For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation\u2019 - 1 Thessalonians 5:9 \u2018But let me reveal to you a wonderful secret. We will not all die, but we will all be transformed!\u2019 1 Corinthians 15:51 \u2018God has saved us and called us\u2019 - 2 Timothy 1:9 \u2018We have been justified through faith\u2019 - Romans 5:1, Romans 5:9 Most churches believe that Jesus\u2019 death was necessary for the forgiveness of sins. But Jesus, like all other prophets, taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. No human sacrifice is necessary for salvation. No human bloodshed is necessary for salvation. No savior should die for the salvation of others; everyone is responsible for his own salvation. Jesus has also confirmed the same in Matthew 18:21-35, 6:14-15, Mark 11:25-26, Luke 6:35-38, Matthew 19:16\u201319, Matthew 21:43, and Matthew 25:41\u201346 When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of atonement, they have added verses like Matthew 18:11 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost The bible footnotes explain that verse Matthew 18:11 was not in the original old scriptures Hebrews 9:22 \u201cwithout the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\u201d is a misunderstanding of verse Leviticus 17:10-14 which is not about atonement but is about dietary laws. God has clarified that blood in meat is not good for health; that clarification was necessary to the people who did not have advanced medical tools to know that eating the meat with the blood still in it is bad for health The true word of God is not what is written by the unknown writer of Hebrews; it is what has been taught by Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah, Jesus and the Prophets who taught the forgiveness is possible by obedience, repentance, and prayers Proverbs 16:6 teaches that \u201cIn mercy and truth atonement is provided for iniquity.\u201d Psalm 69:30-31 teaches that praise worship is better than sacrifice 2 Chronicles 7:14 teaches that forgiveness is obtainable without a blood sacrifice \u2018If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin\u2019 Jonah 3 teaches that people are forgiven when they repented and fasted, without offering any sacrifice and without shedding any blood Proverbs 17:15 states: \u2018He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous, both of them alike are an abomination unto God\u2019 That should be considered as a warning to the teachers who promise free salvation to the sinners and who teach that the innocent has been punished on behalf of the sinners Jesus taught the parable of The Prodigal Son in Luke 15:11-32 to highlight the importance of obedience and repentance as the main prerequisites for salvation That is the core Christianity teaching as taught in Matthew 7:21 Not every one that said to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven Jesus has confirmed the teachings of the Old Testimony \u2018in repentance and obedience is your salvation\u2019 as taught in Isaiah 30:15 In Matthew 25:31-45 Jesus described the final judgment as being based on good works; he clarified that those who obey the law will be saved Salvation is not based solely on belief and nothing else; salvation is not granted to those who merely profess acceptance of Jesus without performing kind or compassionate deeds In Luke 13:3 and 13:5, Jesus taught that repentance is necessary for salvation But unless you repent, you too will all perish Mark 12:33 teaches: And to love one\u2019s neighbor as himself, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices What Jesus taught here is not different from the wisdom taught by the old testimony Hosea 6:6 \u2018For I desire mercy and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings\u2019 That verse teaches us that forgiveness is possible by repentance and obedience; no sacrifice is necessary Matthew 9:13 teaches that Jesus came to call the sinner to repentance \u2018I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance\u2019 The wrong teachings about original sin, atonement, and salvation by grace without obedience to God\u2019s law were taught by Paul who was not educated by Jesus.

But it is the LARGEST religion with 70 million Catholics in the United States. No other religion has suffered such attrition of the faithful, I would say, due to the reports of abuse, and due to the reports of so many cases of covered up abuse, with the victims of Catholic nuns and children. It is heartbreaking really and I think it's too late for the Pope to hold it together or build it back up. I really feel for all this Pope is having to deal with day after day, in unveiling these sins that come to light. I feel for all those who were abused and could say nothing for so long. Can you imagine trying to walk in the ways of God and righteousness, while being touched by a Holy Order? Can you imagine the psychological conflict that would stem from that, in a child's mind? I was raised in Catholic Schools and Parish and never knew of any of this, then. As far as I know, St. Paul's was clean of this. And I believe there are enough Churches that people will not turn away from, that will keep Catholism from total collapse. Not to mention the strong Catholic faith still strong in other countries. But in America particularly, we already see a pulling away, going by the numbers. ",

            "answer_text": "Not soon enough - it is hopefully well on the way to collapse because of all the corruption scandals and paedophilia scandals perpetrated by its members. Think to yourself what would happen if such things happened in any other business - a bank for example, or a school, but the Church members get away with it mostly. Added to this the falling numbers in congregations. With the advent of literacy the Church finds it more difficult to control the populace and as people are getting more knowledgeable about the world and universe around them they are seeing that this outdated Bronze Age idea of a divine being clearing it's throat or clapping it's hands and everything winking into existence as it currently, is utter nonsense. The only reason it exists nowadays and has not gone the way of so many other religious institutions in the past - like Zeus or Odin-both of these were in their time extremely powerful religions. Nowadays people do not believe in them. Is because unscrupulous people have seen that religion is an excellent way to control people and enrich themselves - by conning, bullying, intimidating, coercing and threatening the trusting and gullable out of their hard earned money and belongings. To make themselves and their Church richer. That is the primary reason that it still exists. Anything else is just an offshoot of this reason. Comfort when you are grieving? Does the priest do the funeral service for free? Or do you have to pay? Baptism? Does the priest do that for free or do you have to pay? Weddings, anything and everything if it involves the Church or it's members you have to pay through the nose for it. Why? To enrich the Church and it's members. No other reason. The sooner people wake up and see the Church for what it really is - not what the members of the Church want you to see. The happier the world will be. ",

            "answer_text": "Since the only Roman Catholic (which is somewhat distinguished from the Eastern Orthodox Catholic church) is the modern one, then its collapse would mean the end of that false system. If you are looking for a renewal, then that would likely require a evangelical (the enemy of traditional Catholics) revival within Protestantism. Contrary to traditional RCs who imagine that the liberal Catholics are self-excommunicated, that is not up to them to declare, and Rome manifestly considers them to be members in life and in death. It is traditional RCs who presently stand more of a change of being censored by Rome than the liberals. The real problem however is the both the traditional and liberal Catholic sects are part of a church which is the most manifest deformation of the New Testament church, for distinctive Catholic teachings are not manifest in the only wholly inspired substantive authoritative record of what the NT church believed (including how they understood the OT and gospels), which is Scripture, especially Acts thru Revelation. Yet due to the incomplete nature of the Reformation and as God allowed unbelievers to test His people in the Old Testament, (Judges 2:22) and as Catholicism still retains (amidst errors) common salvific Truths whereby a relative few can be saved, then God allows it to continue. Yet before the Reformation it was even worse in moral respects: As Cardinal Ratzinger attested, \"For nearly half a century, the Church was split into two or three obediences that excommunicated one another, so that every Catholic lived under excommunication by one pope or another, and, in the last analysis, no one could say with certainty which of the contenders had right on his side. The Church no longer offered certainty of salvation; she had become questionable in her whole objective form--the true Church, the true pledge of salvation, had to be sought outside the institution.\u201c \"It is against this background of a profoundly shaken ecclesial consciousness that we are to understand that Luther, in the conflict between his search for salvation and the tradition of the Church, ultimately came to experience the Church, not as the guarantor, but as the adversary of salvation.

            "answer_text": "I take \u201cthe modern Catholic Church\u201d as referring the particular form and structure under which the eternal Church is manifested at this particular point in terrestrial history. The question then becomes, at what point, and from what cause, will the everday workings of the Church become so different from what they are now that it will be impossible to say that her current form still exists? In other words, if the primitive Church represents one stage in ecclesial history, and the Church today represents another, when and why will we see the next stage after this? Well, I\u2019m no seer, Heaven knows, but my guess would be that it will have something to do with the reconciliation of Russia. Our Lady tells us this is going to happen eventually, and I can\u2019t imagine that it will be unaccompanied by certain theological developments - notably a clear enunciation of the limits of papal authority, with a corresponding increase in the perceived status of individual bishops (not their real status, which of course doesn\u2019t change) - that can\u2019t help but have dramatic and far-reaching consequences for the day-to-day life of believers everywhere. Plus, the mere fact of having this huge, influential, culturally rich nation and its unique religious spirit suddenly joined to the Body proper - well, that\u2019s just going to change things willy-nilly, isn\u2019t it? As to when this is going to happen - well, your guess is as good as mine. As near as I can make out, the Pope could set it in motion whenever he chooses; it\u2019s just a matter of writing a prayer consecrating Russia to the Immaculate Heart and commanding it to be prayed somewhere in every Mass, at least by the celebrant. But first he has to want to do so, and we seem to be on the ninth pope in a row who doesn\u2019t want to. (Which is bizarre to me, since I always thought that bringing souls into the church was the primary objective of a pope, and leaving 150 million of them outside because you can\u2019t be bothered to spare five minutes for their reconciliation seems like the sort of thing that would be hard to explain at the Judgment Seat. But maybe they\u2019ve just been intimidated by the thought of so momentous a grace being dependent on their action.) ",

            "answer_text": "I think the Catholic Church may reduce its power and its number of followers along the next centuries, but I doubt it will collapse to the point that it will be unsustainable and eventually disappear\u2026 Or rather, I think that, when that day comes, that may be because the entire boat of Christianity as a religion is sinking fast. Despite what I perceive, at least in my country (Brazil), as a dangerous and generalized apathy and sameness, a loss of the urge to spread the gospel and compete for the souls and minds of people, a decrease in the number of young priests and nuns that only the blindest and most stubborn Catholic will refuse to notice, a sort of \u201cshrugging\u201d attitude in the face of very strong and increasingly radical competition by evangelical churches and non-religion advocates\u2026 Despite it all, I think the Catholic Church still has a huge advantage: it\u2019s strongly built, it has solid foundations that are the result of cumulative effort of dedicated people for two millennia. More than its material wealth, which has actually been slowly overridden by that of big evangelical churches whose faithful unfailingly pay their tithes (and a few of them even charge as much as 30% of their followers\u2019 income!), what\u2019s the strongest feature of the Catholic Church is that it has a slowish but ultimately efficient and resilient organization, it has true institutions, above all it has a richly developed theology and an actual intelligentsia to maintain and develop its doctrine and tradition. It\u2019s also, unlike so many other churches, a church with a very clearly defined identity and a millennia-old tradition and intellectual output all of its own to offer to the Christian followers as unique aspects that won\u2019t be easily found elsewhere. Your average Catholic won\u2019t witch from the Catholic Church to another \u201ccatholic-like church\u201d that looks very similar, but less old-fashioned or more congenial. So, in my opinion, the collapse of the Catholic Church could happen if, unlike in previous times of change and crisis, the Catholic authorities completely refuse to adapt to the new circumstances and to make the necessary amendments to their institutional and organizational practices, even if that does not mean, obviously, changing the dogmas and the core, truly religious principles of the Church. I think that\u2019s unlikely: though the process of change in Catholicism has always been slow and tentative, very carefully done, it ultimately happened, and the Church went on in a somewhat renewed form. That\u2019ll probably happen again sooner or later, no matter how the ultra-traditionalists wish to believe, without basis on the real history of the Church, that everything, including the slightest rules and costumes, has always remained exactly the same since the primitive Christianity, and the traditions and doctrines never developed gradually, organically, without clear ruptures along the centuries. The other possibility for the complete collapse of the Catholic Church is, of course, if Christianity as a whole is completely destroyed by the spread of another religion or by the generalized shift of people to irreligious belief systems. But, since humankind is always so varied in behavior and thought, I confess I find it very doubtful that some day we\u2019ll have such absolute unanimity on spiritual and more broadly metaphysical matters, so even if Christianity and, with it, the Catholic Church decrease tremendously, I\u2019d expect some small groups of Christians to remain faithful to their beliefs.

In my case, I was technically born Catholic but never practiced or new my faith until my late 20\u2019s at which point I started studying the actual arguments for and against religion in general. I was bamboozled by the false notion that science (which I still love to read and learn about) disproves religion. Oddly enough, my interest started in a science class where the TA was talking about how life started and presenting the theories for how life could have began which were, at best, week. Once I started actually reading the reasons for believing God existed, rather than what is often a misrepresentation of the arguments offered by skeptics, I found them to be compelling and eventually become Catholic\u2026for real this time.

It\u2019ll likely get smaller, but Jesus Himself, who founded the Catholic Church (in spite of the myth that it was really founded by Constantine) said in Matthew 16: 18\u201320 that the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it. The Church has been through rough times, and arguably this is the roughest time she\u2019s ever been in, but it will survive, and thrive once the heretics are gone. This may take another 20 years, but it will go on, and will be stronger for the wear. There is a great satirical story written by the Italian satirist Boccacio in his work Decameron. During the reign of the Borgia (Pope Alexander VI), there was a prominent Parisian Bishop who was friends with a Jewish businessman, who was thinking of converting to the Faith. One day, the Jew goes to the bishop and says he\u2019s going to Rome to do business with the Vatican. The bishop says, \u201cYou should get baptised now, before you go,\u201d and the Jew says, \u201cNo no, I\u2019m a practical Jewish businessman; business before pleasure. I\u2019ll be back in three or four months and you can baptize me then. Farewell.\u201d The bishop thinks that he\u2019s lost his friend forever, because once he sees what Rome is like, he\u2019ll not want anything to do with the Church. The Jew returns, and says, \u201cAlright, I\u2019m ready to be baptized.\u201d \u201cBut, didn\u2019t you go to Rome?\u201d The bishop says. \u201cYes.\u201d The Jew says. \u201cYou went to the Vatican?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cYou met the Pope (Alexander)?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAnd you still want to be baptized? Why?\u201d The Jew smiles, and says, \u201cI told you, I\u2019m a practical Jewish businessman. No institution so incompetent and corrupt could last fourteen weeks. The Catholic Church has lasted fourteen centuries! It\u2019s a miracle!\u201d Jesus chose twelve very flawed men to be His Apostles. Judas Iscariot forgave sins, drove out demons, healed the sick, and raised the dead. The first public act of the first Pope was to deny Our Blessed Lord three times. These twelve men were not the sharpest tools in the shed, by their own admission! So, if the Church, after the Resurrection and Ascension could survive them, with all their flaws, and 2,000 years of bad popes and clergy, it\u2019ll survive this too. ",

Instead, there will be a time when the immemorial Faith which Christ has handed down will triumph. I don't know when it will take place, but I do know that Francis I is teaching lies that will lead us to perdition if we listen to him. We must resist. We must hold fast to the truth even if it is unpopular in the modern age. We must not give up on the truths that were taught From every pulpit before the error of Vatican II. If you are a member of a modern Catholic church, get out. There are chapels and churches across the country that unfailingly adhere to the Catholic faith without adulteration. TRADITIO Traditional Roman Catholic Network, including the Official Catholic Directory of Traditional Latin Masses was where I found my first chapel in California. Now I assist at Mass in a church supplied by the Society of St. Pius V. I don't consider myself a member of that society, but will accept any priest who has been ordained in the pre-Vatican II rite by a bishop with valid succession. Any chapel that holds fast to the Faith and the Mass of St. Pius V will work as long as they are not old Catholic. Yes, I did say to ignore pope Francis I. I said it because he is leading the New Order church into worse heresy than ever before. He is not Catholic, but a hater of anything that is traditional and true.

While the Church is often in conflict with the World, that\u2019s to be expected. There will be points of agreement but because Catholicism/Christianity is considered a revealed religious/truth, it is easy to reason that where the World goes wrong, the Church is probably right. Those disagreements may cause people to leave, and have done so, but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone will leave. The Church is also still strong in many parts of the world and the Roman Rite is just one of many approaches to worship within the Church (we get the term Roman Catholic because most churches are Roman right). There are around 25 other rites that are still in communion with Rome and the Orthtodox churches are still essentially catholic themselves. As a Catholic, I can get a valid Eucharist within their doors. So, I really doubt we will see the demise of the Church. If it becomes less powerful or noteworthy, it\u2019ll still be around. ",

We believe that the Church is not simply a human organization but established by Jesus Christ himself and protected by the Holy Spirit. A non-believer might scoff at this notion, but it explains how an institution has survived through persecutions of all sorts, conflicts with civil governments, divisive heresies and corruption of it leaders in many periods of time and still survives. Times like the present with corruption reaching to upper levels of its leadership usually lead to purification and renewal. People of great holiness\u2014saints\u2014are raised up in such times and bring a return to the central truths and practices of the faith. Sts. Benedict and Francis of Assisi are two of the more well-known saints who brought about renewal. There are women saints such as Catherine of Siena and Theresa of Avila who worked for renewal of the church in times of upheaval and corruption. So I do not believe the Catholic Church will collapse but will emerge stronger in faith, though perhaps smaller in numbers. ",

In Qu\u00e9bec, for example, where it participated as a full partner in civil government for a couple of hundred years, it is no longer a going concern. Much of Europe has abandoned it as well. More and more people around the world are failing to find organized religions and traditional ideas about various gods relevant to their lives. More and more people are finding themselves to be a-religious, if not a-theist. I know many nominally Catholic, socially conservative French people, for example, who never go to church and who confess to not believing in any gods, let alone the Catholic one. They only have their children baptized our of a sense of cultural continuity. It is hard to imagine that these children will keep this custom. It is difficult to imagine that the Catholic Church could be much of thing in most parts of Europe after another generation or two. In other parts of the world, though, the Church and popular sentiment towards it are stronger. Africa and South America come to mind. So, I don't see it dying, just becoming much, much smaller. ",

            "answer_text": "Question is wrong. Should read \u201cWhy will the Catholic church NEVER collapse?\u201d Answer: the reason the Catholic Church will never collapse is that it has more real estate than any other organization in the world. The Catholic church has more Relics than any other organization in the world. The Vatican is its own country with no debt and a constant income with little cost. Now, will the Catholic church fall into darkness a 2nd time? Well, the 1st time began after fighting back against Islamic invaders and the church needed money. So they abused power, became greedy and vain until finally the people PROTESTED and became PROTEST-ants. It seems phrophesy's point to a world wide deseption and a 2nd falling away from the truth and only a few wise ones will see thru it. Looking back historically, my best guess is it will have something to do with greed, money and finances. So in the middle of a MAJOR financial crisis which spawns many wars, someone or some organization will present what appears to be a solution and most of the world will follow it, causing the downfall of the Catholic and Protestant churches. Phrophesy says 1 third of the land, ocean, and air will be \u201cscorched\u201d. In the 70\u2032s it was believed a nuclear holocaust. We now know what was taught about Nuclear weapons was greatly exaggerated and mostly BS. Besides, the prophecies seem to read that the scorching happens prior to the crisis meaning the scorching is part of the cause of the crisis. It seems to me that worldwide climate change and the scorching could be referred to as the same thing, thus a contamination of 1/3 of freshwater land and Air; not a sudden event but a gradual climax, reaching a Tipping Point which is basically how most crisis in history of happened.

But that does not mean itsGodly influence will be effective. Today, the world is filled with institutions that prop themselves under the banner of \u201cChrist\u201d and band together under the protection and direction of various denominational and doctrinal titles. But though they may call themselves Christian, their impact on the world for Christ is often questionable. The Book of Revelation 2/3 describes 7 churches that fall under the watchful eye of Jesus Christ (\u201cI know your deeds\u201d) and even though these 7 churches were birthed a mere 5 or 6 decades since the resurrection of Jesus, five missed the mark and received failing grades from Jesus!! Because of their failure to heed Christ\u2019s heart and compassion and instead mixing with the World system through compromise and apathy, Jesus in Revelation 2:5 proclaims \u201cConsider how far you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.\u201c Removing the lamp stand means to take the light of Christ from the churches or as Paul writes in 2 Timothy 3, \u201chaving a form of godliness but denying its power.\u201d The Catholic Church is not alone. It will along with so many other denominational churches, continue to be a shell of gathering but, unless the focus returns to humility, love, selfless compassion and the attitude of Christ, they will all collapse in terms of fulfilling the message of Christ and run the terrifying risk of Matthew 23:15 \u201cWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.\u201d ",

The Catholic Church nearly collapsed in the 8th century when it was distanced from the Eastern Roman Empire, was under assault from Muslim armies in Spain, Sicily, southern Italy, under assault from Viking pagans and Magyar pagans in the west, north and east. No one would have bet it would survive. But it did. Then in the 15th century again - the Protestant movement away from Catholicism in the north, then the Turks attacking in the east. No one would have bet it would survive. But it did. And then the Nazis in the 1940s. No one would have bet it would survive. But it did. \u201cHow many tank divisions does the Pope have?\u201d asked Stalin? Well, Stalin\u2019s empire is gone, but the Catholic Church remains.

            "answer_text": "A more pertinent question would be, When will organized religion collapse? The belief in religion is bought about by misattribution of cause to effect, the human need for community, and escapism. There also have been scientific studies published which establish a negative correlation between IQ and religious belief. This implies that the more intelligent you are, the less likely you are to believe in organised religion. Note that I am talking about organized religion, not God. Humanity does not have the knowledge yet to prove or disprove the relevance of a piece called God to our current universe. It would be foolishness, rather, to claim you don\u2019t believe in God. But, it has been an average of 2317 years since the founding of the major religions. If we do not have the knowledge today to make judgements about the relevance and nature of God, it is improbable that humanity had the ability to do so when the major religions were found. Thus, the major religions are safely dismissed as a bunch of twaddle. Now, getting back to your question, due to the Flynn effect, bolstered by the diffusion of scientific knowledge, the increase of living standards(thus reducing the need for escapism from hellish living conditions the early believers in religion needed), it is my opinion that the need for organised religion will be eliminated by this century. That is, if the world does not descend into a fiery apocalypse triggered by global warming. ",

As the virtually all Christian Sects, including Catholicism, are, for the most part, created, governed and beholden to mortals, their collapse is inevitable. Read any history of the Catholic or Orthodox Churches or even virtually all other Christian Sects, even those histories deemed official by their own church organizations, it becomes very clear over time they have become very different from both the gospel and organization presented by Christ. None of the numerous changes even claim to be divinely directed by revelation from God. It is very clear political and monetary influences, rather than spiritual direction, have been key to both doctrine and practice. Even the greatest protestant reformers did not claim divine authority or direction in what they did. Most decisions focus on logical argument, both abstract and biblically based, although on occasion there is some reference to the influence of the Holy Ghost as a secondary guide. ",

While a large number of religiously intolerant people are slathering at the idea that it will somehow dissapear due to its current sex scandals, I think that is unliky and they are probably getting their hopes up for nothing. The last twenty years have been pretty rocky for the Catholic Church but they are literally 1% of the time it has existed as an institution. They have seen far more difficult challenges than this and pushed trough them. Don get your hopes up that they will be gone anytime soon, you would just be setting your hopes up for nothing. ",

If you are perhaps referring to the Church, post Vatican II, then subsequent liturgical practises and trends which may have been a result of misinterpretation of the Spirit of the Synod, may in time cease to any longer be a part of the conventional and authentic practice of the Faith. For those who miss the \u2018traditional\u2019 culture of the Church and long for its return, the wait may be longer than anticipated and hoped for. Afterall, generations (including myself) were raised with many of these ideas and practises through the example and teaching of religious as well as formal schooling. But signs of change are evident especially following reforms put in place by Benedict XVI. Disputes, rebellion, trends - these may all come and pass. But the Church will remain strong and steadfast for all time. Collapse it shall never! \u201cAnd I say to thee. That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.\u201d Matthew 16:18. ",

WARNING 4! All dressed up like Bishops or priests are ipso facto automatically excommunicated infidels against God's Dogma (God's Catholic Dogma (God's Catholic Dogma))! \"Vatican 2\"ists, \"recognize and resistors\", and \"independents\", you are all ipso facto automatically excommunicated from Christianity i.e. the Catholic Church (which has no properties in these endtimes) (God's Catholic Dogma (God's Catholic Dogma))!

DISCLAIMER! In no way do I endorse the Michael Bizzaro's or the Victoria DePalma's pretenses to be Christians! CAUTION 1! They still quote Antipopes \"Pius IX\", \"Leo XIII\", and \"Pius X\" as if they were Popes even after exposing and quoting their written and spoken heretical statements on their own website. CAUTION 2! They tenaciously esteem the Amerikkkan Masonic Democratic-Republic's right-wing Zionist leaders! CAUTION 3! They tenaciously attack the Biblically described Flat Earth Dogma de Fide unanimously taught by the Fathers, Doctors, and Saints! CAUTION 4! They tenaciously deny that even lay Christians can make Theological errors in good Faith! This insane denial inevitably causes them to deny the inerrancy of Canonizations of Saints! This scandalous denial inevitably causes even their own ipso facto automatic excommunications from Christianity! CAUTION 5! They tenaciously hold the \"Two Magisteriums\" heresy! CAUTION 6! There are no Christian on YouTube channels or websites on the internet in any language! ",

If you look around at other organizations that have gone on for more than a few decades, you will see there is a tendency to structure themselves in ways similar to the structure of the Catholic Church. Traditions radically different from Catholics, such as the churches affiliated with the Southern Baptists, have made changes in recent decades to codify their points of faith in order to draw the lines of who is in and who is out, create a more rigid hierarchy of authority, affiliate themselves with the powers of the State, and exclude female members of their congregations from those positions of authority. All these things go far to ensure more control at the top and more brand loyalty from those at the bottom. Catholics take the long survival of that institution as proof that it is the true Church as Christ intended it to be. I don't anticipate they will have evidence to the contrary any time soon. ",

Jesus promised that the gates of hell would not prevail against His Church founded on the Rock of the Apostle Peter. History is a great teacher. The Catholic Church came through 300 years of Roman persecution in its infancy, then it survived the fall of the Roman Empire, invasions of barbarians, the advance of jihadi Islam, corruption of the Italian princes murdering each other for the papacy in the 800\u2013900s, stand offs with the Holy Roman Emperor, schism with Byzantium, attacks of the Turks, the splitting of Christendom by the Protestant Reformation, 220 years of persecution in Britain and Ireland, the attempts of Napoleon to destroy the Papacy and commandeer the Church, the sneering of the philosophes and rationalists, Bismarck\u2019s Kulturkampf, the attempts of the Soviets to utterly destroy Christianity, Hitler\u2019s menaces and mass murder of Catholics (especially Slavs) , and the attacks of secular moderns\u2026\u2026 Sure we have problems at the moment, but not really as bad as in Second World War -time when the Gestapo had St Peter\u2019s Square closed off, or when Napoleon had kidnapped the Pope and stuck him in the castle of Briancon in the French Alps, or when Pope Leo the Great had to ride out to meet Attila the Hun and persuade him not to destroy Rome.

It will simply be the reunion of the separated parts of Christ's kingdom.

People need spiritual leadership, and currently over a billion people look to the Church for it; more are coming all the time. ",

The Catholic Church began with the teachings of Jesus Christ, around 1st Century AD in the province of Judea of the Roman Empire. The Catholic Church is the continuation of the early Christian community established by Jesus and no modern Christian Church can make that claim.The Catholic Church remained the only Christian Church until the East-West Schism of 1054, which caused medieval Christianity to split and become two separate branches. The greatest division, however, came during the Reformation from 1517-1648, led by Martin Luther.The Catholic Church gave Christians the Bible we have today. Outside of the Catholic Church there is no divine faith. Divine faith is when we believe a thing upon the authority of God, and believe it without doubt, without hesitating. \"Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood. \"Acts 20:28\"And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church\"Ephesians 1:22.Abuse happens in all religions and are mans sins.Mans sins won't make the church untrue.

Anything else that is contributed based on human edits that conflicts with the Gospel, is only a stumbling block for souls. There are several R.C. dogmas that should be corrected based on the words in the Holy Scriptures. This is only one example: Someone wrote, \u201cIt is also wise to pray to Our Lady, because she is, really, our church, and she won\u2019t collapse.\u201d [sic]~~~~~~~ There is nothing in the Holy Scriptures that tell us to \u201cpray to \u201cOur Lady\u201d (Mary, the earthly mother of Jesus). 1 Timothy 2:5 says, \u201cThere is one God, and one Mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.\u201d There is one Mediator and it is Christ Jesus. Not angels, not saints, and not Mary. All our burdens, all our prayers, all our requests go directly to God through our relationship with Jesus Christ. John 14:13, \u201c\u2018Whatever you ask,\u2019 Jesus said, \u2018in My name that will I do that the Father may be glorified in the Son.\u2019\u201c If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it. God is not reluctant to hear our prayers; nor is Jesus reluctant to hear our prayers, so that we need to go to the mother of Jesus who supposedly can soften up Jesus who then can soften up God to show some interest in our dilemmas. LUKE 1:46 Mary\u2019s words: \u201cMy soul glorifies the Lord 47and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,\u201c My spirit has rejoiced in God, my,\u201d what? \u201cMy Savior.\u201d That may be the most definitive thing that ever comes out of the lips of Mary. To acknowledge that God is her Savior is to acknowledge that she is a sinner like everyone else. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 ANOTHER COMMENT: \u201cshe (Mary) is, really, our church, and she won\u2019t collapse.\u201d [sic] ~~~~~~~ JESUS is our church \u2026 THE Holy Christian Church. Ephesians 1:22-23 And he put all things under His (Jesus) feet and gave him as head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all. Colossians 1:15 The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. 16 For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. 17 He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. 18 And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. 19 For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, 20 and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross. Ephesians 5:2 For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body. ",

It is called this because Babylon of old was a religious city where all the doctrines of the religions of the world originated. Things like the trinity, the immortality of the soul, and hellfire. These are some of the reasons why it will soon be, not collapsed, but totally destroyed. The Catholic church has already collapsed. Catholic League president Bill Donohue comments on a new Gallup poll of Catholics: We knew that younger Catholics were going to church in fewer numbers than in the past, but what is new about this Gallup poll is the decline among older Catholics. Overall, only 39 percent of Catholics say they attend church weekly, and among those aged 60 and over the figure is 49 percent. This means that \u201cfor the first time, a majority of Catholics in no generational group attend weekly.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The institutional Church, if it is to be faithful to the Lord, must be willing to give up everything it knows as existence, trusting God will raise it up again (like its Master) in a newer, glorified body. So the institutional church can very well go kaput, but that won\u2019t mean it\u2019s the end of it. When that will happen? God knows. But Catholics believe there is more to the reality of the church than its very frail, sinful human elements. There is Jesus. There is what Jesus left it, particularly the Eucharist. Where there are those gathered for the Eucharist, there is the church. If, theoretically, you could go back to the first decades of the church and visit one of those ancient cities, and if you were to approach a believer and ask, \u201cHey, where is your church?\u201d the believer would answer, \u201cHey, here I am!\u201d So it will forever be.

The age when the Church had the most spiritual integrity was in the early centuries when it was a renegade, countercultural movement calling people to a holier way of life rather than an arm of empire seeking power.

The only thing that really holds it together is the families of Catholics who hold on to their family traditions. This will only last so long. However, my own opinion (as one seven billionth of the worlds population) is this: as a continuation of the corrupt Roman Empire, the Catholic Church will endure till the Coming, except that the last of the faithful will have left by then, leaving the corrupted shell it started with.

I'll also keep it short rather than go through each of the proofs (identifications) referenced in the books of Daniel and Revelation. To avoid a lengthy article on each identifier, let me simply say that past Popes have admitted, publicly and in writing, that the Catholic church is the apostate church/beast described primarily in Revelation chapter 13 (whereas God's church will fit the definition primarily provided in chapter 12). They admitted this because the evidence is too specific and numerous to deny. That being said, the Bible goes on to say what will happen and why in the following chapters of Revelation. In other words, they will not collapse until the end; until Jesus returns. ",

This pope should be easy to spot. Likely he will preach things that go against Catholicism and Christianity both. Things like homosexuality, transgender and the like will become, just the way GOD made them. Islam will likely be elevated by him despite it\u2019s denial of Messiah. Rules on marriage and divorce will be lightened by him, in direct opposition to Messiah making them harder. (Matthew 19:3-12/Mark 10:2-12) He will encourage people to ignore local priests and pastors and follow their own hearts. All of this will just be the beginning. If you see a pope doing any of these things, the Antichrist will be soon be sure to follow. All modern churches will end at the second coming as Messiah will create His church for the Millennium. And that is when the Catholic Church will end in my opinion. ",

We have been given the promise that the Holy Spirit will remind her of all that Jesus taught and lead her to all truth. But it is filled with wheat and weeds; filled with people who all fall short of the promise and glory of God. The Church decided long ago that it would be a lifeboat for sinners, not a fortress for saints. She offers help and the grace of salvation to all who want it; but, being filled with sinners, cannot determine the state of anyone\u2019s soul who comes to her, be it as a lamb or wolf. And she remains the Church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it, until the End. ",

One thing that I am certain is that there will be the second coming of Christ and when that happens, we can be 100% sure that it is the collapse of the Catholic Church or of any religions. Why? Because religion is a system that controls a population for political/financial purpose. We have no need for religion. Jesus fulfilled all covenants and abolished the need for religion and yet we somehow managed to keep making new religions and kept them intact. Church is not a property nor a religion property. It is group of people who have same Holy Spirit wisdom and understanding. They get together to grow in Holy Spirit and to make Earth like it is in Heaven. ",

I am not sure that the Catholic Church is really much of an issue. As an organization, it commands a certain power and respect internationally. Better that than Islam or Hinduism. What the Cathoic church does or does not do has no bearing on what I do or how I act. It played a role (though minor) in my journey toward faith, so it really is mostly irrelevant to me and most non Catholics. Politically, it is in a free-fall due to the number of scandals and lawsuits regarding sexual abuse. Will that cause it to collapse financially? It is possible, though this is a multibillion dollar organization. I live in an historically Catholic town. Sharing the gospel is relatively easy to a Catholic as they already believe in the deity and virgin birth of Christ. It takes a little time, but many Catholics leave their church and become Christians when they see what they have been missing. ",

            "answer_text": "As a retired minister, yours is a question I ask myself and have asked myself often in the last few years. My speculation is not restricted to Catholicism in particular but mainstream Christianity in general. My \u201cdenomination\u201d and I use that term loosely to describe the Centers for Spiritual Living, is far from traditional Christianity but I fear slated to go the route of Lutheranism, Methodism and the Episcopal Church as well. The demise of what is called organized religion is happening much quicker in Canada where I live than in the US. The latest census in Canada indicates that less than 12% of Canadians attend church services regularly. The situation is brighter overall in the US though a recent study by the Lutheran Church in America (I\u2019m not sure which Synod) has determined that they have 27 Easters left before they \u201cgo dark;\u201d before their present constituents all die off and are not replaced by a younger demographic. The prognosis for Roman Catholicism appears to be slightly better. This is in part due to immigrants from the 3rd world. There are huge Catholic populations in Africa, South and Central America and the Philippines that in immigrating to Canada are giving new life to Catholicism. I would say unless there is a reversal of the trend, churchgoing as it was practiced by my parents, \u201cthe Builder Generation\u201d will disappear as the \u201cBaby Boomers\u201d myself included \u2018shuffle off this mortal coil.\u201d ",

Perhaps that is why their churches have become little more than Christian activity centers, or a \u201cbusy box\u201d for the spiritually immature.  Perhaps The Catholic Church creates a better environment for those who take their faith seriously, and who wish to seek God without being surround by a noisy circus of activity.

If you simply mean when will the Roman Catholic church collapse, I doubt that you will ever see it collapse entirely. There has been an organization centered around the Bishop of Rome for say 1600 years. The Roman church is \u201cvery Lindy\u201d or anti-fragile to borrow a term. Now it might not look very much like it currently does in a century, but you\u2019ll still have a pope, you\u2019ll still have some hierarchy, and it will still be largely about Jesus and the sacraments. Now if by modern you mean the Roman Catholic church that we see today riven by schism in all but action since Vatican 2, I think that entity will be changing (along with most protestant churches) over the next 15 years. The people that wished to \u201cmodernize\u201d the church, by which I mean pitch out its basic moral teachings, are largely older. The church is going to be smaller, but at this point, anybody younger than 45 who is still in the church today is present because they believe its teachings. That church, more differentiated and confident, is going to emerge out of the modernist struggles. You can already recognize it in places. The troubles that we see today are simply the birth pangs and the shedding of that modernist rebellion. ",

I regard Pope Francis as a reforming voice for the church.
