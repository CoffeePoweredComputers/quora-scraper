            "answer_text": "It will cause more exploitation of nature. So far we have seen that lock-down is having a positive impact on nature. The air is getting cleaner, wildlife is reclaiming the lands occupied by humans. But on the other hand, the economy of almost all countries is suffering. Therefore, to revive the economy of The United States of America, President Donald Trump has roll backed almost 100 environmental laws.[1]  It means that the US will not follow the laws to control the pollution levels in air, sea and land. Almost all these laws have set the permissible limits of emissions for factories, vehicles and other sources of pollution. Without environmental laws, factories will release a great number of toxic elements which will not only cause the failure of previous efforts to save nature but also they will accelerate the process of climate change. Now if this step proves to be successful in reviving the economy, then all the other countries will follow the same path. It will destroy the nature at an exponential rate. Environmentalists are protesting due to this rollback. I hope their protest will be successful as this will directly impact the future generation. Changes like social distancing, preference to online education, etc. are already mentioned in other answers hence I am not writing those points again.

            "answer_text": "The only way that Covid-19 will 'affect\u2019 the world is that it will DESTROY mankind\u2019s 'sense' of the FAKE \u2018world\u2019 they created for themselves (not the physical planet). No matter how much HUMANS 'attempt' to 'coexist' with this virus, it did not come here to make 'friends' with this species (noting the fact that other animal and plant lives are not being affected). It has successfully built a throne on this planet, and sits comfortably while watching humans scramble to accommodate it's presence. And while it knows that their efforts are futile (only slowing things down temporarily), it has plenty of time on it's hands to wait (unlike these modern-day humans who are in rush to get back on their hamster wheel). In that time, it can bank on the \u2018predictability\u2019 of humans (who are not accustomed to maintaining clean closed spaced environments) and will find ways to slip through the cracks. As a passionate advocate for planet earth, I felt a necessary obligation to come to Covid-19's DEFENSE, since the humans on this planet consistently turn to their elected officials to help them understand something that is invisible, silent, and deadly. Everyone sees Covid-19 as the \u2018enemy\u2019 of this planet, and yet no one looks at themselves as the reason for it's arrival (trash, pollution, GREED, chemicals, drugs, burning gasoline, bloodshed, neglect, toxic bodily fluids and secretions, unhealthy lifestyles, etc.). For far too long, mankind has been 'independently' constructing a 'world' (or a convincing reality) for people to live within. In order for this 'world' to make sense, men had to create a 'narrative' (complete with various buildings, transportation, business attire, and actors) that billions of \u2018sheeple' blindly follow (through print, radio, television and social media). Once this narrative became widely available on countless screens, it became much easier for officials to control their people, and convince them that they can protect them in the event of potential man-made threats (between nations). But as history has shown us (looking at past pandemics), humans are NEVER prepared for threats that derive from unknown sources (particularly biological). And even though modern man has constructed COUNTLESS weapons of mass destruction (since the last great pandemics), NONE of the weapons they have built can be used against Covid-19. So for all these officials who are pushing to reopen businesses and schools (after months of being cooped up with shelter in place), please remember, you don't get to decide when 'normalcy' will return. This IS a WAR between the human species on planet earth and the \u2018unseen\u2019 universe. I know it has been HARD for you feeling like you have had 'unstoppable' and 'unquestionable' POWER for so long, only for it to be slipping from your fingers from a 'non-human' POWER that you cannot control. So what happens when men start feeling like they are losing their power (especially against a non-human 'enemy')? They start to turn on each other (man against man), and fight to \u2018hold on' to the power structures they've created (both domestically and internationally). In other words, future wars between citizens and between nations (while simultaneously fighting Covid-19) are inevitable. Also remember that while you are giving orders from atop your seats of power (that you built yourselves), you are RELYING on 'lesser' humans (who are furthest beneath you, and never get opportunities to sit) to 'happily' carry out these orders (with no pay increase). This is what I meant by Covid-19 banking on the predictability of humans. How long do people (employees, customers, patients, and medical staff) think that they can keep up all this cleaning, mask wearing, and social distancing? Are they certain that everyone around them is doing their part? Are 'cleaners\u2019 getting inside every tiny crevice (especially in public bathrooms) where germs can hide and multiply? I think we are starting to get the answers to these questions as places (from states, to cities, to businesses, to amusement parks) have already reopened and then closed right back up again (and the virus hasn't even been here a full year yet). Another thing people should keep in mind is that there is NO cure or vaccine for this virus (no matter what the media says). Not only would a vaccine be \u2018unable\u2019 to fully stop Covid-19, this virus is not seasonal (like the flu), and constant 'unpredictable' vaccination jabs will cause more harm than good (to the body and the environment). As a mystic 'seer,' I have seen glimpses of the future. I blink and see a lot of abandoned businesses, closed forever. But I also see that the perfect flawless pictures (which will remain on their windows) will still show the smiling carefree faces of the models doing what the business used to provide. At a time of near starvation and famine, people will look at pictures on fast food chains (and abandoned company shipping trucks) colorfully displaying the perfect menu items of foods and drinks once served there. The pictures will remain, but the food, the business services, and the 'happy' times will not. I know that none of this seems promising (just the messenger), but the best advice is to just keep doing what you are doing to buy yourself as much time as you possibly can. Continue to experiment with reopenings (even schools), because \u2018human\u2019 death is an \u2018inevitability\u2019 with Covid-19 present on this planet. In a short amount of time, this virus has become the ultimate 'elephant in the room.\u2019 Since it's arrival, it has joined forces with other 'causes of death' on this planet in order to speed up the process towards a NEW era of humanity. In the end, Covid-19 will die off, and nature will grow over (and cover) the land, swallowing miles of buildings and cities across the planet. Only the plants, the insects, the animals, and the most extreme nomadic humans (those living in remote areas of the world, without technology, drugs, chemicals, and who only eat from the natural earth) will survive.

            "answer_text": "I just attended a McKinsey alumni video conference call today about the firm\u2019s thoughts on the post Covid-19 \u201cnew normal\u201d. It was very interesting. The speakers, who were all McKinsey partners working with clients to understand what is happening in the business and medical worlds right now, focused on two main slides. First, they talked us through the five steps or stages that companies will go through as we get through this crisis. Resolve, Resilience, Return, Reimagination and Reform. You can read the details below but while we were on the call, they polled the roughly 800 participants and the large majority were at companies in the resilience stage. They noted that the stage currently will depend a lot on your location around the world (e.g., U.S. companies are probably in a different stage on average when compared to Chinese or South Korean companies, as well as companies in the Bay Area are probably in different stages than those in NYC).  Second, and I thought more interestingly, the speakers focused on the future\u2019s potential \u201cnew normal\u201d and what may change. Here are the seven trends that they focused on, noting in several cases that Covid-19 is simply accelerating trends that were already out there.  A few other interesting things to note from the call: They referred to Amazon as potentially \u201cthe new Red Cross!\u201dThey said that excessive on-shoring could cause instability in developing countries as their economies shrink as a result, and that this is something we need to be very careful about.As we return to work and \u201cnormalcy\u201d, it may feel like it did as people first returned from industrial tragedies like warehouse fires in the time of the industrial revolution in that we will probably see an increase in safety regulations that try to prevent future similar situations from occurring.It is very likely we will see the healthcare industry reimagine how to handle and build for efficient surge or flex capacity (e.g. telemedicine could be key).If you want more details, here is a link to a related McKinsey article that was just recently published.

            "answer_text": "The Covid-19 Virus is an unprecedented episode which can only be compared to prior happenings such as the Antonine plague of 165A.D that swept over Asia, Egypt, Greece and Italy decimating the population; and, the Spanish flu pandemic that exterminated almost 50 million people around 1918. What is most distressing is that it has created a change in societal structure in form of social distancing which may potentially degrade our globalized society through which diaspora investors (nkuba Kyeyos) have immensely boosted our economy over the years through annual remittances. Remember our nation has virtually shut down and we\u2019re yet to experience an economic cardiac arrest with no remittances and revenues from sectors like tourism, extractive and manufacturing, agriculture, transport, trade and many other sources. Some governments particularly in Africa are putting in place interventions under the COVID-19 Relief Fund, key of which is to ensure the provision of psycho social support to all those affected. Other critical mitigating measures in place are monetary in nature, while others will necessitate policy adjustments. The objectives of these interventions are to give support to some workers; stabilize businesses; ensure availability of strategic supplies; and, explore opportunities for economic diversification. In Botswana, government is to provide a wage subsidy for citizen employers of businesses mostly affected by COVID-19, to enable them to retain employees. And in order to stabilize businesses, efforts to give businesses some cash flow relief are to be pursued partly by guaranteeing loans by commercial banks to businesses mostly affected by COVID-19. The Finance and Economic Planning Ministry(s) may provide more details on the criteria and guidelines for implementing these particular measures, the way Botswana is doing. The abundance of time spent at home will potentially fuel commotion in health facilities come December 2020 as numerous Corona babies are expected to be brought to life. You can do the maths considering the fact that contraception services are a luxury in hard times like these. This advent has also glued many people to the compulsive hand-held mobile devices communicating with strangers at the expense of their families. Young people haven\u2019t been spared either, for they\u2019re being inappropriately and continually exposed to uncensored media influence that challenges the traditional control of their behaviors leaving them in a generation with no clear cultural identity, and, in fear. Fear is in almost everyone\u2019s mind as a result of lack of knowledge, complacency, foolhardiness and complete disregard for the public health guidelines by those whose apathy is exposing others to great risk of catching the virus. While the devil\u2019s messengers are taking advantage of God\u2019s good people and instilling fear in them, the virus is putting to test common bonds between and within families, neighbors, coworkers and friends. But bloodcurdling as it may seem, this pandemic will resonate well with those who will live through it to see 2021 when many will have been saved from road carnage because vehicle movements have temporarily been put to a halt as a measure to curb the spread of the virus. Many will have to turn to God. . ",

            "answer_text": "Mankind around the globe is in the middle of the novel corona virus tragedy. This turns out to be the biggest emergency for human mankind in several decades (the biggest after WW-II). It looks to be an out of world fight against the invisible enemy. It is like an Alien war, a war against the unknown. There is uncertainty everywhere with no solution in sight. Industries have been put to pause and human movement has been restricted to only for managing Corona, emergency and the essentials. Governments have tried lock down and urgent medical preparation to tackle the pandemic but at this juncture, it does not seem to be controlled. These restrictions have their own challenges and that too drastic ones. It is a catch 22 situation. While humanity continue to fight this mighty army of enemy, it is also important to understand how it is going to impact our lives in short to medium term. There is an old saying that every adversity is an opportunity too. This too is no exception. This post is an effort to summarise its impact on human behaviour and opportunities it brings for humans and industries. Work from Home To the working class, the first and foremost impact is work from home culture. Work from home has its own challenges and advantages. Communication and deliverables could become more efficient. Sell of laptops and other computing devices may increase, transport and traffic may reduce. There could be higher sale of online video conference and collaboration tools. We are already seeing massive growth in the usage of Zoom etc. It will have more competition going forward. Digital Impact on digital services is not only going to be limited to internet usage increase. It is also going to spur sales of digital hardware as more and more people will require equipment\u2019s to be able to work from home. Schools, colleges are going to mandatorily support online learning, which will spur growth in digital devices sale such as laptops, tabs or large screen smart phones. There will be less subscription of newspapers and more people will make digital newspaper or reading as their daily routine. Real estate Less workforce at office means less place needed for employees and hence, this will drive lower demand for real estate prices in metro cities. This will also enable people to work from farther distances than metros and hence can have an impact on overall rental values of real estate in metros including office as well residential spaces. Transport People will prefer more private transport than public transport so there could be hike in private vehicle sale. There could be a reversal of trend in contrast to taxi aggregators impact as seen in recent times. More and more people had started preferring these taxi services than buying cars in recent times. But post corona, it is expected to reverse this trend. With overall decrease in in traffic, pollution levels are bound to improve compared to pre-corona levels. Contact less Access Contactless-ness of a product or service is going to be new buzzword. There is going to be demand for contact less access for public places and utilities. People wearing disposable gloves could be usual sightings on railway stations and airports. There could be contact less lift (elevators) and door handle solutions. Ticketless or digital ticketing is going to get a boost. People will do more cashless transaction in order to avoid contact with strangers. Public places will see minimal physical contact between strangers therefore overall business activity is going to get a hit. eCommerce More people are going to prefer ordering stuff online than going to crowdy supermarkets and malls. Almost everything including items such as alcohol could be available in online delivery. Ecommerce sector is in for big growth trajectory. Health, Medical Naturally, Vaccines and medicines are going to be the main warriors to tackle the virus. Sanitizers, PPEs for medical staff, masks, soaps, sprays, wearables such as masks, caps etc are already seeing huge surge in demand. Masks have already become a mandatory item for everyone as can be seen everywhere. There may come a trend of more such wearables such as disposable cloths or helmets. There is going to be more focus on immunity boosting food. Workforce availability Workforce is going to be a big challenge for factories and industries as lot of people have returned to their hometowns fearing lockdown challenges. There is no certainty in their return. This is going to impact factory functioning output greatly. Convincing many of them is going to be huge challenge. Will this boost automation in industries? Will this spur rural economy? Can this phenomenon motivate decisionmakers to move factories to areas near to rural areas or dedicated labour centres? Will this whole phenomenon call for more structured and regularised approach towards blue colour job workers? I wish all this happen. Well, this is too early to comment as factory setup requires a lot of social, political will in addition to other things. Opportunity is to revisit and reshape how blue collar job workers work and move. This can help decongest large cities as well as push more geographically distributed growth in countries. This certainly can bring lot of positivity in the post Corona situation. Economy and China factor Talk of the town is to avoid over dependence on china due to all the events related to Corona Virus. But does the world have enough political will? is this practically possible? Whatever be the case, it is certain that there is going to be call for diluting this dependence. Some industries will move out of china to other alternative locations such as India and other south east Asian nations. This is the time for prospective countries to extend olive branch to attract them. Another important thing is the export from china that goes to all over the world including Europe, Africa and Americas. Can there be an alternative source of such goods with comparable quality and price? I think no single country has the capacity to do that but certainly, a strategic collegium of countries can provide long term alternative. This is the time of making strategic alliances for businesses and filling the gap arising out of current situation. This is not going to be easy, but we shall see efforts in this direction. Businesses consider various factors before choosing a destination country for moving their factory setup. Cost of workforce, international trade agreements, ease of business environment, choice of geo location (due to strategic reasons, cost of export, transport and market) are few important factors for these businesses for taking the call. Environmental Focus This is one impact that is a rare positive of this whole situation. Environment has improved significantly and in fact a generation is seeing the best of nature for the first time. Can this create more awareness towards preserving mother nature? Will there be long term investments? There can certainly be more efforts and investment towards this cause. Overall, it is going to be a very happening world going forward. It has already impacted our lives massively in short term. lets see how it shapes our lives in medium to long term. ",

            "answer_text": "The Coronavirus pandemic is going to affect the world. And here is how: The economy to slowly decrease and increase. Because the DOW JONES is increasing and slowly decreasing as the weeks are coming ahead. The economy is slowly decreasing and increasing. However, the value of housing and taxes are still increasing, sadly. As they say, this is worse than 2008\u2019s the Great Recession.There will be lots of job losses that people need jobs. After this huge pandemic that caused lots of jobs losses, many are jobless. Some might get their jobs back, but due to the economic situation, many needs a job ASAP. Thus, if you\u2019re considering studying in the health profession: I highly recommend it.Lots of registration for financial aids. As many people lost their jobs, watch as there will be a rise in financial aids\u2014to the point where the Government has to provide financial aid for everyone.A rise in inflation on food produce. As many people are losing their jobs and applying for financial aids, some stores have increased inflation on meat products, dairy and others. Food is a necessity, and not everyone cannot afford it. Thus, comes food banks.A decrease in buying take out food, technology and non-essential item needs. After pandemic, watch as many will start saving up their money for backup needs. Instead of wasting money on the latest iPhone 12 Max Pro whatever or the latest GUCCI bag\u2014people will start saving money. Additionally, we will see a lot of high-end brands and restaurants closing down.People will support and buy local produce. Because during this pandemic, as the American and Canadian borders might close but will reopen for the economy, we must support our local farmers and entrepreneurs.The slowdown in market production. For example, many items are made in China or Vietnam (iPhone 12 and clothing for example). However, due to the Coronavirus, it might slow down market production and thus there will be delays. There will also be delays in book conferences, too.Small chains and huge retail stores shut down. During this pandemic, little food and retail chains cannot handle on keep paying their store rent. Thus, some might give up and closed down their businesses. Although online shopping may help boost the business, some companies don\u2019t do online sIt\u2019s sad to see it that way.Overlook at all health care practices and systems from all around the world. From what I have learned in Medical Anthropology, is that not all medical specialists from around the world may look at all country\u2019s cultural and medical practices. By the time COVID-19 is over, I think there will be a rise in looking at other countries\u2019 health practices\u2014and possibly collaborate with each other.More respect for frontline people, health care workers and people working in the essential services (hospitals, lorry drivers, etc.) While many people may disregard truck drivers for bringing fruits and vegetables in their fridges, housekeeping for cleaning hospital rooms, doctors and nurses for taking care of their patients, police officers in giving fines to those wandering around during the pandemic; these essential workers sacrifice their lives for our protection and well-being. After the pandemic winds down to normality, I think people will appreciate them more.People being more cautious about washing their hands. When COVID-19 is over, you should expect some people being more cautious when they wash their hands. Certain people might wear the mask, but expect the majority to wash their hands.Rise in racism among Asian people and the Asian community. Trust me, there are some ignorant people who generalize the idea that a race causes that. Watch as after COVID-19 is over, we will see a rise in racism in Asian communities. It is sad but it\u2019s true. It is going to affect a lot of us.More elders are dying and a rise in death rates. I know this affects Canada but I don\u2019t know about the rest of the world, but due to COVID-19, many elders are dying from the Coronavirus. As the same time, there is a rise in death rates, so we must quarantine ourselves to protect others.Climate change is affecting, during the Coronavirus. While yes, people are reducing their drive during this pandemic, furthermore it is affecting the world and yeah. See this blog: What Can We Learn From COVID-19 to Help With Climate Change?Lastly, COVID-19 is going to affect relationships. Whether it be family relationships, your colleagues, your significant other or relationships with your friends; this pandemic is going to test how much the people you know are going to care about you.I don\u2019t know if my predictions can be right, but these are major observations I have made over the past weeks. We may never know when this pandemic is going to end. Stay safe, wash your hands with soap, and stay quarantined at home. It is better to be safe than sorry. Cheers, \u2014Britney Vu \u2665\ufe0e ",

            "answer_text": "Perspective on America\u2019s failure at containing COVID-19 It is apparent that COVID-19 it is a global problem that deserves a coordinated response at a global level to effectively contain. This is why the consistent call for action by the World Health Organization (WHO) is imperative and instructive. The primary instrument put in place by the WHO towards achieving a speedy globally acceptable vaccine for COVID-19 is the Global ACT Accelerator Initiative. The initiative is designed to accelerate equitable access to COVID-19 vaccine by all nations and citizens of the world irrespective of race, color or creed. The ACT Accelerator is a ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments and vaccine. However noble this initiative sounds there are however challenges. According to the DG of WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the initiative is currently plagued by a $35 billion funding gap. COVAX is the vaccines pillar of the ACT Accelerator. It is co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, because it aims to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world. Evidently, it is a clever initiative that allows countries and scientists around the world to work together for a common goal rather than working at cross purposes that may be expensive and time-consuming. It allows the pulling together of resources and scientists across the world to receive funding for their research. For the initiative to work, countries around the world have to pull resources together. However, only about 10 percent of the funding needed has been received so far according to Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the WHO. Speaking earlier in September during a meeting of the facilitation council of the ACT he expressed worries that, \u201cThe ACT Accelerator will not be able to deliver on its goals without a significant increase in funding; it still faces a funding gap of 35 billion US dollars,\u201d Tedros noted. Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator simply known as ACT Accelerator or ACT-A was launched on April 24, 2020, and provided with political and financial support through a global pledging event of May 4, and June 27. It has already established a dynamic portfolio of vaccine candidates, launched a global facility to optimize vaccine development and use. Furthermore, the ACT initiative ensures that African countries are not left out when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines development and distribution. African countries have always been left behind on issues of global health and development. This is not the time to put the profit motive at the forefront or to embark on a race whose primary motive is profit. It is shared humanity, the world must act to save humanity, this should be the driving force and principal objective. The coronavirus presents an opportunity for global solidarity and the ideals of shared humanity. It doesn\u2019t matter to the virus if you are rich or poor, and it can strike irrespective of who you are or where you are. It is expected that the world comes together, put all differences aside to fight what obviously is a common enemy through the ACT-Accelerator initiative. This is not the time for experimenting with human lives, countries across the world must show solidarity with one another through information sharing, and humbly seeking advice and guidance where necessary. There is no doubt that what is needed at this particular point in time is global cooperation and solidary. Hence the pain and anguish many feel when some politicians play politics with human lives. On July 8, United States President unilateral pulled the United States out of the global health body, WHO after he had earlier pulled funding from the organization in April on grounds that the WHO withheld information about the virus.  \u201cThis is a tragedy that is forcing us to miss many of our friends, losing many lives. And we cannot defeat this pandemic as a divided world. The Covid-19 pandemic is a test of global solidarity and global leadership\u201d. He had said. The US is the global health agency\u2019s largest single contributor, withdrawal of funding means the WHO would lose as much as 15% of its total budget. It has been estimated that as of March 2020, the U.S. owed the WHO about $198 million in assessed fees. There is no doubt that the de-funding will impact the fight against the coronavirus and could worsen the pandemic, especially in developing countries that relies on the WHO funding. Moreover, with the U.S missing in the global effort to develop a vaccine through the ACT Accelerator project, it has abandoned its traditional global leadership position when it mattered most It is unfortunate that the current US president is prevaricating, and playing the blame game. The president believes America is an island into itself and as such can survive in isolation. He preaches the greatness of America without considering that America\u2019s greatness is tied to the rest of the global community. As at the middle of October, the total number of deaths from COVID-19 in the United States has already crossed 220,000. Yet the president continues to behave like a bull in a shop, lashing at everyone, isolating his traditional allies and going it all alone. The World had thought that having contracted the virus himself he would learn that the virus is real and a respecter of nobody. Sadly, this has not been the case. He continues to downplay the severity of COVID-19, exposing innocent lives to danger and death. It is ironic that while he had access to the best treatment money can buy other Americans do not have the same privilege. In recent days the spread of the virus has spiked in America and a second wave is expected as the country enters the flu season, but the president is more concerned with his re-election bid. America\u2019s failure at containing COVID-19 has been a shock to many. The country currently accounts for almost a quarter of worldwide reported cases of infection. Thus, making the United States a global hotspot of the pandemic. The question is how has the United States gotten to this sorry state that has led to the death of thousands of Americans and counting? All indications so far point to a failure of leadership and the politicization of the global coronavirus pandemic by the Trump administration. The president\u2019s public messaging about the coronavirus has been a disaster since January. At no time did he took the virus seriously or devised a national response strategy. He equally failed to mobilized a global response strategy but rather pursued a unilateral and an America only strategy by negotiating future deals with pharmaceutical companies that guarantee that only America has access to future COVID-19 vaccines. The recent publication of Bob Woodward\u2019s book \u201cRage\u201d gives an insight into the president\u2019s leadership failure that allowed the virus to spiral out of control in the US and its consequential effect on the global efforts to contain the virus. The president and journalist Woodward interview have allowed the public to hear and understand what he was saying about the virus behind closed doors. In the series of interviews which collectively lasted nine hours, the president indicated he was more aware of the threat than he was conveying publicly. And he admitted to playing down the threat, concealing what he knew about how deadly and contagious the virus was. The president admitted to journalist Bob Woodward as far back as in March that he deliberately downplayed the dangers posed by the virus so as not to cause panic even as he recognized how \u201cdeadly\u201d the virus was. In another clip of the interview as reported by CNN, the president is quoted to have said, \u201cI wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don\u2019t want to create a panic,\u201d The president told Woodward. Even when there was scientific evidence that wearing a mask offered protection from contracting and spreading the virus, the president was in denial. He neither wore a mask nor encouraged do his supporters to wear a mask. Taken together, the president\u2019s private comments and public pronouncements reveal two distinct narratives. What he knew was the infallible truth backed by science was far from what he told the American people. In fact, the president was more concerned with his public perception than he was with the lives of people. Even after contracting the virus, he continues to downplay its seriousness while getting the best care backed by science.

            "answer_text": "The world will soon start to function the way it does typically, only if the contagion subsides in the coming couple of weeks and majority of the population has recuperated. Doctors and scientists finally will take a deep sigh of relief. Around the globe, researchers will try and push themselves to strengthen the medical system by discovering new ways to make medicine resilient to such outbreaks in the future. Markets will recover in a couple of months if not weeks, just the way they did post the previous outbreaks.  People will be working in business as usual mode and social life will get reinstated to normal.  But on the flip side if it does not, then this one of a kind pandemic can become an avalanche, which will have severe consequences, not only to human life but also to the society as a whole. Here's how.  All these greens in the backdrop will turn red The world economy, which is already lingering around the tipping point, will probably collapse. World's top market indices, viz. Dow Jones and Nekkei have already touched an all time low. SENSEX has dropped it's worst since the 2008 global recession. Unlike the strained household industry ten years back, this time there are multiple industries such as transportation, automobile and leisure that have stretched the economy too thin. They are also the worst impacted at this point. The number of defaults on loans have increased exponentially due to the high interest rates, which have landed these corporations into more debt. This is worse than the impact of the housing market, taking into consideration the size of each industry. The vicious cycle will get worse. Entertainment and sports industry Movie shoots will be cancelled indefinitely, which will impact the production of content on OTT platforms as well. Sporting events, just as the NBA and NHL, will be suspended, which will not only include the Indian Premier League but also the Euro 2020 and Tokyo Olympics, until there is any positive development. Repercussions of social distancing As per the government mandates worldwide, people have been strongly recommended to refrain from public gatherings and limit themselves to working from home till any turn of events. Schools and universities have been called down to shut and limit mob clustering. This collective move is indeed remarkable in times of such crisis, but being cocooned at home with no physical human interaction, which is unlike the usual way of life for most outgoing people, might affect them psychologically and take a toll on their mental health. If this persists for a duration more than expected, chances are people will take longer to recover from a disturbed state of mind.  Or even worse could be people revolting against their government and choosing not to isolate themselves. This could make the situation far worse and the probably recovering situation might slip out of hands. Quarantine or herd immunity will be the most viable solution  The rapid pace with which the virus is spreading, chances are that the medical system might be on the verge of flaking out. Doctors and medical professionals, who are treating patients will possibly get exposed to a much larger number which might increase the probability of them getting infected. If most of medical fraternity gets pinned down, people will be forced to keep themselves in self quarantine rather than seeking medical aid. Moreover, herd immunity could be adopted in the worst possible scenario, where majority of the population gets infected and recovers on its own, thereby making itself immune to the virus in the longer run. The downside is that the number of lives lost will be innumerable. Finally, panic will be taken over by chaos One positive about Ebola as compared to COVID-19 is that its outbreak was prevented before it could plague urban areas. COVID-19 is now in more than 125 countries and right in the most busiest cities of the world. This has created panic which is taking the shape of chaos. A recent incident where two ladies got involved in a tussle over tissue paper roll at a supermarket last week might probably be just a glimpse. People will start hoarding daily supplies of food and medicine, and this shortage in the retail shopping centers would lead to people wrangling and wreaking havoc with no regard for law and order. Technological advancements have leaped in the last century. Hopefully, this doesn't get as bad as the Spanish flu of 1918, with the vaccine getting rolled out in a couple of weeks. At the same time, not taking the situation for granted won't do harm. ",

            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question. At this point, I\u2019m a bit alarmed by the executive orders written by many governors, ordering people to shelter in place. These executive orders are of questionable legal standing, and the governors who issued them may find themselves in a poor position in the future. Another thing I wonder is related to what we assume the viral outbreak to look like as it compares to what the viral outbreak actually looks like. Many models assume The United States will follow a trajectory more similar to Italy\u2019s than to Germany\u2019s.  Which Country Has Flattened the Curve for the Coronavirus? (New York Times) If I were to predict the number of cases over time in The a United States from these initial data, any prediction I would make would contain a massive amount of error\u2014 the assumptions would fully relate to what I expected the viral case curve to look like based on the curves of other nations, and the peak rate prediction would be most affected by which areas of the curve I allowed the most error in my fit. Even with a horrible prediction, the estimates resulting from the prediction would still be scientifically valid as estimates. The confidence we should afford these estimates, in real terms, remains to be seen. I hope these estimates, and their errors, result in an increased statistical literacy among the general public. At this point, I dare say that The United States will not be as severely impacted, on a per capita basis, by SARS-CoV-2 as some other nations. To provide context, Italy has more hospital beds per 1,000 people than The United States\u2014 I believe about 2.5 for The U.S. and 3.2 for Italy. In contrast, The United States has about 30 Intensive Care Unit beds per 100,000, which is very similar to Germany. Italy has about 13 ICU beds per 100,000. This is one reason we see the rationing of intensive care in Italy, and the mortality which results from such measures: Facing Covid-19 in Italy \u2014 Ethics, Logistics, and Therapeutics on the Epidemic\u2019s Front Line | NEJM It is important to mention here that COVID-19, which is the syndrome resulting from SARS-CoV-2 which we all fear\u2014 acute inflammation of the lungs\u2014 requires intensive care, specifically mechanical ventilation. Patients with acute respiratory stress secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection who are not provided with intensive, life-sustaining, care will become hypoxic and expire quickly. I note, with great dismay, that many people who are publicly analyzing the crisis in Italy are not mentioning the measures currently in place which are designed to provide care to some at the direct expense of care to others (at the expense of the elderly in particular). These measures are a direct result of a lack of intensive care unit capacity. The United States, on the other hand, is often criticized for providing too much intensive care treatments as they are generally expensive, and do not always result in the patient \u201creturning to normal.\u201d While this may be true in some cases, patients, and their families, in The United States demand, and pay for, this level of intensive care, which leaves The United States with tremendous ICU capacity and many trained intensivists year-round. In many ways, the criticisms of The United States healthcare system being too resource intensive and expensive, which appear valid at face when everything is \u201cfine\u201d from a public health standpoint, become immediately invalid under emergent conditions, when we see other healthcare systems discuss their shortages of intensive care capacity. This shortage does not currently exist in The United States, and I would be very surprised if it were to occur even during this current outbreak. I hope in the future we become more aware of the mortality which results in times of crises (specifically, when trends in treatment deviate from the norm, making the allocation of resources difficult for the central authorities) from rationing measures employed by nations with centralized healthcare systems. Aside from that, I hope we learn that we should always be practicing good personal and respiratory hygiene\u2014 especially every year during flu season\u2014 not just in times of perceived crisis.

            "answer_text": "Are you a coffee drinker? Tea perhaps? What is your favorite tipple? Do you like French cheeses or Swiss chocolates? One of the main consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to be the disruption of international trade. We may even be witnessing the end of the current phase of globalization. Companies in the West will be re-evaluating their over-dependence on global supply chains now it is becoming clear that something like a pandemic can overturn the system virtually overnight. Some people will cheer. They believe globalization was a mistake. Outsourcing of manufacturing simply made workers in developed countries poorer. Then there are the claims that rampant capitalism is destroying the planet. What this ignores is that globalization has also been responsible for raising millions out of poverty, helping make the world a slightly more egalitarian place. Of course this has a long way to go, but stopping it\u2014or worse, reversing the process\u2014will simply create a much more unstable world. As an article coronavirus-killing-globalization-nationalism-protectionism-trump by Philippe Legrain on the Foreign Policy website notes as late as the end of February, most policymakers and investors wrongly assumed that it would have only a brief, limited, China-specific impact. But, he says, the coronavirus crisis is likely to have a lasting impact, especially when it reinforces other trends that are already undermining globalization. Already, many Western companies have come to rely on China-centered global supply chains that are particularly at risk as both Democrats and Republicans increasingly view China as a long-term strategic rival that needs to be contained. The coronavirus crisis could mark a tipping point by showing that supply chain disruptions could wreak far greater havoc on the global economy\u2014and national security\u2014than most CEOs and governments realize. It may prompt many businesses to remodel their supply chains. But while American companies may well decide to relocate their factories stateside, they are also likely to embrace the next wave of AI-led automation to run them. Most significantly, Legrain warns, this crisis plays into the hands of nationalists who favor greater immigration controls and protectionism. Many ostensibly liberal governments have slapped restrictions on travel and trade more draconian, he notes, than even Trump dared impose at the height of his conflict with China last year. As a result, the coronavirus crisis threatens to usher in a less globalized world. ",
