            "answer_text": "France, like the US, has a morbid relationship with Israel. Haaretz\u2019s editor-in-chief Gideon Levy has said that the US\u2019s pandering to Israel puts the country at risk. Of course it does. Israel has for decades been provoking not only Iran and the rest of the Shiite world but also its own Palestinians, and instead of providing adult guidance to Israel, the France and the US both refuse to criticise Israel, fearful of being branded anti-Semitic. In fact France has passed a bizarre law that equates anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism. French parliament adopts controversial law linking anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism This is beyond absurd because a large percentage of Israelis and US Jews, for example, are bitterly opposed to Zionism and its mistreatment of Arabs. Which begs the question whether millions of Jews can be anti-Semitic. When Palestinians misbehave toward the IDF encroaching on their land, it is common \u2014 and accepted \u2014- practice to shoot them, sometimes in the head or more commonly in the legs so as to maim them for life! 'Shoot to maim': How Israel created a generation on crutches in Gaza (Shoot to maim. How Israel created a generation on crutches in Gaza) Israel: 'Deliberate attempts' by military to kill and maim Gaza protesters continues Amnesty: Deliberate attempts by military to kill and maim Gaza protesters continues Further, Israel has for years been routinely firing lethal missiles into Israel, often hitting targets in the vicinity of the Damascus airport and endangering the lives of passengers. In fact, the Russians \u2014 who are permanent guests of the Syrians \u2014 lost a large surveillance plane when Israeli jets used the plane as a shield when firing at Syrian targets. They also caused a near miss of a commercial airliner a few days ago by firing at a target near the airport. Their excuse is that they have the right to kill Iranians in Syria because supposedly Iran is an enemy. Yet, dozens of Iranians have been killed by Israel in the past few years while there is no proven case of Iranians having killed Israelis. Further, Iran is an invited guest of the Syrians who have benefited from Iranian defence against terror. The reason Israel gets away with these things is that no one \u2014 including France and the US \u2014 complains about these atrocities. In fact, both countries reward Israel for being a genocidal killer. The only hope of changing Israel\u2019s behaviour is the possibiity of a Jewish president. After all, they can\u2019t call him anti-Semitic. ",

            "answer_text": "The relations between France and Israel were excellent between 1948 and 1966. France greatly assisted Israel in building the country, sold it much of its military equipment, and Israel was largely Francophile, preferring the French culture to the despised post-mandate British and cold-shouldered American cultures. Then, De Gaulle came to his senses and cried foul: \u201cmy countrymen, have you lost your senses? What\u2019s with this emotional support for Israel, we are french - we have business to attend to!!\u201d. And thus ended the 2 decade romance, with the most lopsided arms embargo in history. France resoundingly chose commercial and political relations with the Arab world, and seems to be so inclined ever since. One can fault a liberal-minded culture for embracing capitalism, right? ",
