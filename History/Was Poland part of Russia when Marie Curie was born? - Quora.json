            "answer_text": "Poland was not a part of Russia, but the eastern territorries of Poland were a part of the Russian Empire. Formally it was a Kingdom of Poland with the Russian tsar as a head of state \u2013 the king, with the Russian authorities, and the administration organized on the Russian patterns. Maria Sk\u0142odowska, later Sk\u0142odowska-Curie, was born in 1867 after the January Uprising of 1863 against Russians. In the wake of the uprising Russian authorities ordered all teaching in schools to be in Russian. Russian also became the official language of the country, used exclusively in all offices of central and local governments. All traces of the former Polish autonomy were removed and the Kingdom was divided into ten provinces, each with an appointed Russian military governor and all under the control of the Governor-General in Warsaw. All the former Polish government functionaries were deprived of their positions and replaced by the Russian officials. ",
