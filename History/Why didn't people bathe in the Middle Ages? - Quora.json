            "answer_text": "Because they thought bathing was bad for your health. That belief is in fact not so preposterous in the middle age environment. First of all, they had no idea about bacteria, germs, microbes, and how these things cause diseases. Their fundamental idea of medicine was that of the four humors, and based on that they did all the blood letting, rubbing dead rabbits against their injured bodies and so forth. In addition to that, vast majority of people in the middle ages had no access to clean drinking water. They thought water was bad for health, and their water in fact was bad for health. They drank beer instead of water to quench their thirst, and beer was in fact healthier, because the alcohol in it purified it by killing most bacteria. Therefore it wasn't that unbelievable, that they thought bathing is bad for health. Their water was contaminated in most places, so why would they dip their bodies into it? Later, when people got access to clean water, regular bathing rather quickly became a cultural norm. ",

            "answer_text": "They did, but at home peasants and serfs generally either went to a pond, lake or stream to wash. They didn\u2019t have tubs or vats, so they resorted to sponge baths in the colder weather. Public Roman baths survived for centuries in certain cities like Paris, London and others. The baths were very inexpensive, and the bathing assistants doubled as sex workers. The Church eventually closed all these public baths on the spurious grounds of immorality. I say spurious because the Church not only condoned prostitution, some bishops actually ran brothels. Keeping clothing clean was a huge problem for serfs and peasants in winter. Clothing had to be made at home, and it was far from cheap. In warm weather people could wash clothes in the local stream, but not from November to April in most of Europe. And, not all peasants had access to a stream or body of water. You can\u2019t wash clothes in a well, and they had no vats or tubs. ",
