            "answer_text": "The answer is very simple. When Cristopher Columbus set sail west to find another route to reach Asia he did not know about the huge continent that laid ahead some 5000 miles away, all he wanted was to find a new trade route and at the same time to prove that the Earth was round since in those days it was believed that if you stray too far West you would drop off the edge. It sound rediculous today but that was the belief then. On the 12th of October of the year 1492 he and the 3 carabels arrived in what is today San Salvador (Saint Saviour), he thought he reached India, hence natives from the continent are called Indians. He returned to Spain and presented his findings to the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, whom were very pleased with the news. A further couple of trips to the new lands were sponsored by the Monarchy, further Islands were discovered, Hispaniola, then Cuba which became the main hub for further trips by other explorers. As further lands were discovered a process to make them part of Spain started, and this is where the Conquistadors come into place. Cortez set sail to what is now Mexico and made that the New Spain, Pizarro went further South to Peru and Chile, Cabeza de Vaca US Southwest, many others followed to make the whole continet part of Spain, from Tierra de Fuego to what today is Canada. There are hundred of explorers that took it upon themselves to discover these lands. So the reason they were sent, and not all were sent but many went in search of fortune for themselves, was to conquer the new lands and make them part of Royal Catholic Kingdom of Spain, and in the process make their fortune and status. Portugal already had trade routes to Asia via the Horn of Africa so they did not need to go West, however shortly after the discovery of the Americas, Spain and Portugal divided the World via the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, West for Spain and East for Portugal, as it happens part of what is now Brazil fell in the East side. This is the short answer, it was about acquiring, be it lands, fortune, fame. Spain made it to the Americas first and they made it their own, today that legacy can be seen everywhere. As someone suggested on Quora before please read The Spanish Pioneers by Charles Lummis an amazing, insightful book. ",
