            "answer_text": "Flexibility, collaboration, integration, innovation management and the ability to synthesize and adapt new information quickly and seamlessly into your world view. Depth of knowledge in single disciplines will still be needed, but the true heroes are going to be the polymaths, generalists and strong collaborators who can see the connections between disciplines, the opportunities in collaboration and who can leverage and motivate disparate teams towards a common vision that the individuals may not be able to see on their own. Companies who want to be successful are going to have to disband top-down models and empower more dynamic groups that can restructure around new opportunities, bringing together disciplines that, historically, may not have collaborated. Those same teams need to be able to collapse and reform around the next new ideas. There will need to be more tolerance for experimentation and less focus on incremental improvement. Innovation is going to be required to remain competitive. It's going to take new, high-risk ideas and an ability to mitigate and learn from failure. That's going to require a level of trust and empowerment that most current organizations aren't prepared to sustain. ",
