            "answer_text": "Greatest Superhero might be a stretch, so I won\u2019t try to convince you why he is the the greatest superhero of all time. I\u2019ll just tell you why he\u2019s my favorite superhero of all time (which is also why he\u2019s the greatest). He\u2019s one of us Before Spider-Man superheroes tended to be beyond human. Nearly infallible and just completely beyond us. Superman was nearly perfect and Batman was rich beyond the dreams of averice. But Peter Parker? He had trouble paying the rent. He did everything he could to protect his aunt and later on his wife as well. He always has problems. Not just supervillain problems, but real problems that his readers would be able to share with him. Compared to Superman or Batman or the Fantastic Four it was like watching yourself in the comics.He never gives upI can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve seen Spider-Man look completely defeated. On his last legs, bleeding profusely and barely able to stand. But then he finds that last scrap of strength and pushes through. He\u2019s not invulnerable like some heroes, but he can take a lot of damage without dying. But it still hurts. A lot. His sense of humor I have always loved him for that. Even when all hope is lost and there\u2019s nothing left but darkness, he is still a ray of sunshine. Because he always finds a way to make a joke about something. Or at least say something that is so awkward you want to laugh at him. He does this for two reasons. For one it helps keep him from being afraid, if you\u2019re laughing you can\u2019t be crying, right? It helps give him the strength to face incredible odds. The other reason is that it is frustrating for his enemies. It provides a distraction when he just runs his mouth non-stop when he\u2019s supposed to be serious. Some villains just can\u2019t handle that. Interesting (unique?) powerset Obviously this is less the case now that he\u2019s got about 15 different carbon copies plus a large amount of imitators. But when he came out and for years afterwards there really wasn\u2019t another hero like him. He mostly operated on a street level, but with the combinations of his powers he is easily able to compete on a larger scale. A lot of that is due to his spider-sense and his agility. If he doesn\u2019t want you to hit him, you\u2019re probably not going to do so. He\u2019s one of the quickest non-speed heroes around and on top of that he gets a warning message to keep him safe. Add in his enhanced strength for greater combat efficiency plus his wall crawling for stealth and evasion and you\u2019ve got one heck of a threat. And finally\u2026. Because he\u2019s still just a man He\u2019s not a legend. No matter how powerful he is, no matter how many times he\u2019s saved countless lives, he\u2019s still just a man. At heart he doesn\u2019t really see himself as being super special. He\u2019s just a guy doing the best he can. Spider-Man truly is the greatest superhero. EDIT: As a comment pointed out, his sense of humor is practically a psychic attack.  That brief look of shock is just perfect. Completely threw him off his game. Granted, that immediately turned to hatred, but still. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, this is because he is a human, just like us, he makes mistake and acknowledges them. He is a realistic role model. You can\u2019t strive to be captain America, or even Batman, that\u2019s unrealistic, they\u2019re flawless (almost) but Spider-Man isn\u2019t. He\u2019s just a guy trying to do the right thing, and he inevitably makes mistakes, and when he does it tears him apart.  Because everyone is another uncle Ben, or Aunt May, or Gwen Stacy, or Harry Osborn, etc. to him. When he bacame Spider-Man he promised himself he wouldn\u2019t let anyone die, full well knowing it was impossible. Unlike of heroes who are boy scouts (which Spider-Man is) he feels guilty about what he has. He is a genius, and his he has superpowers, and he feels that with all that he shouldn\u2019t make mistakes, but he\u2019s human, and so he does, and when he does, he fixes them as best he can. He just tries his best, but his best isn\u2019t always good enough. But he pushes through, prevailes.  He looks out for the little guy, does little springs for them. Sure he saved lives, but he also does other things, he helps old ladies get their food home when their bag breaks, when a guys shirt gets dirty on his way to a first date as a result of a fight Spider-Man was in, he will give him his spare clothes. When he catches a child delinquent he doesn\u2019t turn him over to the police, instead, he helps him get his life back on track, even studies with him.  Every little failure weighs on him. No matter how small. But when he lets someone die (like, SPOILER ELERT: that kid) it really hurts him. He feels that failure personally, and he strives to be better, and that is what makes him such an inspiration. He\u2019s a flawed human, who despite it all, tries to be a good person, and manages to. Though not everyone sees it,  He is a hero (see cap!?! That means it\u2019s true!!!). I can\u2019t emphasize enough, part of what makes him such a great superhero is how much he cares for everyone. Even the villians. He helps the Snadman go legit, gives the Superior Octopus a second chance, and has even saved Norman Osborn\u2019s life. This is Peter\u2019s reaction to the death of that kid:  He cares, he feels every little thing he does wrong, and even some of the things he has nothing to do with. Peter Parker, who we know is Spider-Man, knows good old Spidey better than anyone, and his view is probably the most valid:  ",
