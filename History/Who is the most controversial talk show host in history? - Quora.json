            "answer_text": " This isn't terribly original, but I have to go with Morton Downey Jr. I watched his show religiously and there was always yelling, screaming and maybe even some violence. You likely wouldn't have Springer were it not for Mort. Though Mort did say that his show was of a higher caliber than Springer's. I agree with him. Springer tends to mine the trailer parks of this country. People are beating each up over someone no sane person would touch. Mort dealt with more hot button issues of the time. He was loud, he was rude and he frequently got in nose to nose screaming matches with people. And let's not forget the cigarette he always had in his hand. He was a champion of the smoking man. He always used the only press award he ever received as an ashtray. Later, of course, he did a 180 turnabout and became an anti-smoking advocate. He also became a spokesman for Cigarrest. Unfortunately, it was too little too late and he died of lung cancer on March 12, 2001. ",

            "answer_text": "Not one several Charlie Rose\u2014 for what he did behind the scenes. On screen he was your decent kind intelligent uncle somebody you could talk to about anything. The great Mister Fred Rogers was on his show more than once. Matt Lauer\u2014also for what he did behind the scenes. On screen a modern man very intelligent and charming. The one and only Jerry Springer\u2014 for some of the controversial and maybe even fake guests he. had on his show. Smart man he knew how to attract an audience. The Ringmaster if there ever was one. I haven't heard anything about him behind the scenes that should make anybody worry. Howard Stern\u2014people either like him or hate him I grew up on Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer and Jerry Springer. I have willingly obviously not knowing what Charlie and Matt were capable of could even go so far as to say I trusted them just from the fact they had good on-screen personas.Jerrys show always smelt fake to me (always a fight? Birth parents accidentally marrying their children\u2014every single week?!?)You couldn't fool this teenager when there was nothing else on. Howard's okay at best\u2014 he had on Paul McCartney and I watched that but Howard always seemed kind of slimey to me \u2014I'm sure that's part of his t.v. persona. I think the only person to trust on t.v. is Mister Rogers. Mister Fred Rogers of Mister Rogers Neighborhood. So far almost 20 years after his death nobody can find any dirt on him and may it stay that way. Everybody else these days? Who knows. ",
