            "answer_text": "Take a look at her name: Morgana le Fey. What do you think that name means? Morgan the Fairy. She wasn\u2019t originally part of the mythos, but became consumed by it. There is a lot of debate about if there was ever a historical persona that King Arthur was based upon. But the literary tradition begins with Geoffrey of Monmouth who wrote Historia Regum Britanniae. A book which was supposed to have been a history (and was regarded as such for centuries), but now we know is mostly a collection of myths. King Arthur is not the only story in it, but it also is the source for Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear. Geoffrey of Monmouth used oral sources, primarily from Welsh and Celtic origin. Because Arthur was (mostly) a Welsh creation. When the Roman Empire abandoned the British Isles, the people it left behind considered themselves still Roman and were the Britons. There\u2019s a sort of complicated history to all this, but when the Vikings attacked, a group of Germans (the Angles, the Saxons, and the Jutes) traveled to Briton to drive them off, and then just stayed and started taking over. The Britons tried, unsuccessfully, to repel the invaders. And this is the central conflict of the Arthurian mythos. Historia Regum Britanniae records everything from the founding of the British Isles to the Anglo-Saxon victory. And thus it draws specifically and purposefully from sources that are not Anglo-Saxon. Arthur was the myth of a great king and golden period by the Britons, living in a conquered nation. This is why if you look at Old English, you see stories such as Beowulf. Beowulf is about a Germanic tribe, the Geats, and its adventures in Sweden and Denmark. Despite being relatively distant from England, this story that has nothing to do with British Isles is one of the oldest examples of English literature. You don\u2019t actually find much to anything about King Arthur in Old English because it is a story where the Angles and Saxons are the villains. When the French conquered England in 1066, that was when there was a sudden interest in King Arthur and a flowering of literature about him and his knights. The French considered themselves heirs to the Roman Empire and the pretext for their rule (in addition to the complicated dynastic claims) was that they were restoring the islands to their rightful rule. Which meant a lot of interest in the pre-Germanic culture of the British isles. King Arthur was essentially French propaganda over the Anglo-Saxon population. Hence why all these classic stories about the great British King are written in French. But this whole process took centuries. The stories were cobbled together from mismatched sources and embellished with each retelling. And by the time you get to the French you get the patronage system. Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, the author who created Lancelot, was writing what Marie of France, Countess of Champagne his patron wanted out of a story. Which was a lot of infidelity. Morgan le Fey is a pre-Christian goddess of Celtic origins. Which eventually was laterally moved to being a fairy. Fairies in folklore are mostly benevolent, but a few are malevolent. When Arthurian stories began to be written down, Morgan was presented very early on as a supernatural being ruling the isle of Avalon. Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes in stories like Yvain, the Knight of the Lion presented her as a gift-giving healer. When priests started writing and expanding the mythos in the Vulgate cycle, they took a dim view of all the paganism and sex that had crept into the stories under previous French authors (seriously, compare Perceval, the Story of the Grail to the Queste del Saint Graal which was based on it). And so they transformed her into a more sinister and malevolent sorceress. While Morgan had already started migrating into her role as Arthur\u2019s sister for awhile, they were the ones to fully enmesh her into that place. They were also the ones who made her previous enmity for Guinevere into Guinivere uncovering her infidelity. In the 1400s, long after the French and English had merged cultures and languages, Sir Thomas Malory was imprisoned under house arrest for a variety of crimes. And decided to spend his time writing the definitive version of the Arthurian mythos. Combining everything everyone had ever written. This was Le Morte d'Arthur, which was is the version of King Arthur everyone has been referencing since. Morgan is quite malicious in some parts, and quite benevolent in other parts. Once Guinevere\u2019s own infidelity is exposed, she immediately sides with Arthur for the book\u2019s finale, indicating that her feud was primarily based on Guinevere\u2019s own hypocrisy. Le Morte d'Arthur is fascinating because it was written by someone who was profoundly unhappy with England\u2019s institutions at the time. And so everything in it can be read in two ways. The first is just as a straight up Arthurian romance filled with valorous knights rescuing beautiful damsels. The other is a deeply subversive and deeply satirical take that deconstructs all the previous stories. Hence how Morgan Le Fey comes off as both high villian and also wronged woman who is not particularly evil. So there you have it. The complex and slipshod way that the stories were written turned a Celtic goddess into a villainous sorceress. ",

            "answer_text": "The earlier stories actually have her as an ally of Arthur. She heals him, takes care of his corpse, and heals his knights. Geoffrey of Monmouth\u2019s Vita Merlini has no evil acts on her part. In the works of Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, she is still an healing ally, but aloof and resentful of Guinevere. An anonymously authored 12th century work has her as a queenly character. As time went onward, more editing was done by the priests, who disapproved of a sexual, pagan woman being a powerful, positive character. The Vulgate cycles have her as a villain, and she is absolutely horrific in Le Morte d'Arthur She was not given a heroic role until the Idylls of the King by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Her first positive film role was in Adventures of Sir Galahad, where Merlin is a wicked enemy of Arthur and Morgan is Arthur\u2019s ally. In The 1984 novel Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley, she is one of the protagonists and a heroine. Today portrayals vary: In the 1998 and 2008 Merlin TV series, she is still a villain, but with a tragic side. She is on the side of good in A Knight in Camelot. For the most part, she remains Mallory\u2019s supervillain. Her latest film portrayal, the cheap mockbuster King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table sticks with the traditional villain. Her next appearance will be in the 2019 film The Kid Who Would be King, where Rebecca Ferguson will bring the archvillain character to life. ",
