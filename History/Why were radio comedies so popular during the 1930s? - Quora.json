            "answer_text": "It is hard, in this modern era, for people to imagine how different people\u2019s lives were in earlier eras. Imagine living in an era when wood burning stoves were the norm and you probably didn\u2019t own a refrigerator. This was the era of the Great Depression and the average income was $1368 a year if you had a job. Unemployment was nearly 20%. So what did you do after a hard days work in, say 1932? Television was invented in the late 20\u2019s and by the mid 30\u2019s there were a couple of test stations but by 1940 there were only 8000 households that even owned a television. You could go to a movie or go out but if you are tired and/or money is tight that may not have been an option. The only real thing you had that was inexpensive and readily available was the radio. Radio in the 30\u2019s was the most dominant form of home entertainment. Just like now there were many formats but their were some formats then that don\u2019t exist now. Radio was a great format for storytelling. Before television a lot of the same types of programs you see now were broadcast on radio. You could listen to plays, some of the best actors of the era would perform as voice actors. Vaudeville acts were big on the radio as well, think of them like sketch comedy tv shows or variety tv shows now. Radio comedies were huge, just the way sitcoms are huge now. Your screen was your imagination. ",

            "answer_text": "Radio comedies, and radio dramas and variety shows, were popular in the 1930s for the same reasons that television comedies ( and dramas and variety shows) are popular now and were so since the 1950s. They were a source of entertainment, easily available at listeners' homes, with no need to go out, at very little cost and available for the whole family. Exactly like television shows have been and are today. Keep in mind that television began to be available outside major cities only after WWII. Surely you have seen pictures of people watching television through store windows - and men watching in bars. And most everyone had a radio; maybe only the one, but almost undoubtedly one. Boys built their own radios - a staple science activity into the 1950s, with Radio Shack making a large business out of radio components. There were companies, like Heathkit, which sold kits to make radios and eventually televisions; Dynaco made really excellent kits for high fidelity and eventually stereo equipment. Radios were not expensive, and electric companies subsidized purchases. Many of the early television shows were simple carry-ons of popular radio shows. George Burns and Gracie Allen (the reason Lucille Ball became such a big deal is that Gracie Allen died too soon) were radio stars, as was Jack Benny, and a host of others. On the drama side, Gunsmoke and Highway Patrol were radio shows. For variety, there was Art Linkletter and a great many others; Major Bowes had an amateur hour show. The afternoon soap opera was a staple of radio, just like it became one of television. ",
