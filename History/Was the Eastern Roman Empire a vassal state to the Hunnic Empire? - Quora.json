            "answer_text": "People have a very distorted image today, about notions like \u201cvassality\u201d and tribute, which make it impossible to transmit appropriate information. Know that in the middle ages, vassality was not a \u201cdirected graph\u201d, like in \u201ceveryone is vassal of someone alone\u201d. They changed vassality relations like socks, had sometimes multiple alliances, in particular with lords who were in conflict. Sometimes you had circular vassality relations too. Now going down to antiquity: knowing that the Roman Empire was the proud winner that it was, one would believe that everyone feared them and payed to their richness. Not really. They also had a wide space of border with what they called barbar nations \u2014 which were not always as barbar as that \u2014 and had complex relations with them, between wars and cointeresting them to protect the borders. It happened also that they simply were defeated by the barbars and forced to play tribute \u2014 and they did. Until, sooner or later \u2014 sometimes it took more than a century \u2014 they succeeded to defeat those neighbours. I know that this happened with Ilyrians, then with Dacians, with Gauls probably too, before Caesar. Similarly, the Eastern Roman Empire was much more than the Italian one, in a dramatic vortex of strong military civilisations compared to which it was often weaker. But they had the culture, the memory, the diplomacy. However, several of the Asian tribes which arrived with immense military success in Europe, were held at a distance \u2026 by paying tribute: this holds for Huns, as it did for Bulgars and Avars. Goths were enemies, then seeked refuge in the Empire, from the Huns. Furhter east, the Khazars received high tribute in gold for not alying to the Arabs and attacking the Empire, but rather protecting its borders\u2026 So paying the barbars either because of having been temporarily defeated by them, or in foresight, as a \u201cservice-payment\u201d for protecting the borders, was very frequent in those times. You call it vassality? Your pleasure \u2014 the name did not exist then. ",

Sack of Rome (1527) - Wikipedia But when Attila the Hun standed front of the city, (because of his Scythian moral) he pardoned to the city. Also his winner Scythian-Hun army did not do this and did not rebel against Attila to rob the city like the other armies. The Roman empire uprooted many nations, persecuted christians and enslaved the peoples of Europe, the Huns attacked the Roman Empire because the Huns regarded many relatives folk in the area and in Carpatian Basin. The Parthian Empire in the east made a success war against the greedy Roman Empire. The Parthian Empire also had Scyhtian-Sarmatian connection. The Huns helped to the old Scythian peoples in the Carpatian Basin against the tyrant Roman empire. And his success based on the fact, that most of the people greated him as liberator, because the conquered people got the same rights as the Huns, and their leaders were eating at his table.

The last Roman emperor Romulus Augustulus and the next ruler Odoacer were the men of Attila. Romulus's father Orestes was a Roman citizen, originally from Pannonia, who had served as a secretary and diplomat for Attila the Hun. Odoacer was described by Priscus as a Hun. Historian Erik Jensen, avows that Odoacer was born to a Gothic mother and that his father, Edeco, was a Hun. Romulus Augustulus - Wikipedia Odoacer - Wikipedia ",
