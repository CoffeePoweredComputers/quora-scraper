            "answer_text": "This is an important question and absolutely based on historical fact. The Japanese were guilty of actions of unbelievable brutality toward bot only enemy soldiers, but civilians as well. In fact they were brutal toward their own soldiers and civilians. http://histclo.com/essay/war/ww2/after/jap/wc/w2ja-wcw2.html There were several reasons for Japanese fanaticism and the brutality that flowed from it. Emperor worship: The Japanese not only had great respect for their emperor, but many revered as a living god. We are not sure just how many Japanese actually accepted this, but it seems that quite a number did. The Emperor did not create Japanese militarism, but he went along with it, essentially affixing his seal of approval. royalty -- Japan modern monarchy Hirohito World War IIShinto: Shinto was a highly nationalistic religion supporting the divinity of the emperor, xenophobic nationalism, bushido, and the superiority of the Japanese people. Japanese boys clothes : religion ShintoThe military: Besides the Emperor, the military was probably the most respected institution in Japan. This status gave them the ability to shape Japanese thinking more than any other World War II belligerent. http://histclo.com/essay/war/ww2/cou/jap/force/w2j-ms.htmlMilitarism: The Japanese military steadily expanded its control of the Japanese state and by the late-1930s as in complete control. This meant they controlled the media, academia, and the schools. The military was xenophobic and racist and fully committed to the idea of expanding the Empire by force of arms. The idea of Empire was not created by the military, but no segment of society adopted it with the same commitment. http://histclo.com/essay/war/ww2/cou/jap/w2j-back.htmlBusido: Bushido was the warrior\u2019s code and drilled into the Japanese soldier. It was supported by Japanese society and the schools. It essentially taught and legitimized fanaticism. It was taught in the military academies and internalized by the officer corps. Abd the officers demanded it of the recruits they ked. http://histclo.com/essay/war/ww2/cou/jap/force/army/w2jfa-spirit.htmlJapanese society: Japanese society even before the military seized control was very rigid and nationalist. People were expected to obey the rules and defer to people in power, especially the Emperor. Discipline in society and the schools was rigid. The military did not create this, but intensified it as they gained control of he state. http://histclo.com/essay/war/ww2/after/jap/wc/w2ja-wcw2.htmlThe Depression: The Great Depression convinced many in Japanese society, not only the military that Japanese needed an empire to guarantee markets and raw material. This was believed before the Depression, but much more strongly after the Depression. the Great Depression -- alternative country approachesRacism: Japanese opinion makers convinced the Japanese people thst they were racially superior to all other people and destined to rule the Four Corners of the World. Racial superiority by definition leads one to devalue other people and legitimizing violence. World War II Axis Japan race racism JapaneseWar trajectory: The Japanese were fanatical and brutal from the onset of the Pacific War. In fact this was on display in China several years before Pearl Harbor. The Pacific War began as a victorious war of aggression and soon turned into a war for national survival. This only increased Japanese fanaticism. Even after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, important elements in the military were determined to fight on. World War II Pacific Theater",

            "answer_text": "The only answer is that, they always were. To a point and in a different way and degree, they still are. The key thing to remember is that Japan has never once in all of human history been successfully invaded on the mainland. Both Mongol invasions were destroyed by typhoons and the war ended before the US could invade. The Japanese therefore had almost no cultural change for several millenia until the United States, in 1854, arrived and forced Japan to open its ports to US vessels, prompting the rest of the world to do similar actions. Japan had experienced isolated trade with the Dutch before, but this had merely allowed guns and the arts to enter Japan, and the honor system in place for all of Japanese history still continued in various forms. But the 1854 meeting brought Japan into the modern age. Immediately they began industrialization and soon the Meijing Period began, and Japan encountered a large problem-although they could industrialize very easily, they needed resources and lots of living space in order to become a superpower. So for the majority of the next 100 years they began an expansion into Asia and into the Pacific. Small wars with the Chinese such as the 1st Sino-Japanese war in 1894, the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, and World War I in 1914 allowed Japan to expand its borders far and wide. And the beginning of the 2nd Sino-Japanese war in 1937 only increased this sort of Japanese Manifest Destiny idea. The Centrifugal Offensive in late 1941 saw a lightning takeover of the Pacific, and Japan approached further and further to what they thought was their destined role as supreme leader of Asia. The Battle of Midway in 1942 and the death of their best admiral Yamamoto in 1943 in Operation Vengeance destroyed their chances of ever truly defeating the US, and their failure in the Battle of Imphal in 1944 to the British in India saw the end in that theatre as well. However a small naval battle in the East Pacific was little of matter to the Japanese public, and the assassination of Yamomoto by the American P-38 planes was hidden from the public for a while. As late as 1945 Japan was still trying to takeover China such as in Operation Ichigo, but the US came on too hard too fast and they surrendered before any grand victory against any of their enemies was achieved. So even as late as 1944 the Japanese public were still very much embedded in the belief that they had the God-given right to rule Asia, and this meant for much of their population they were intent on fulfilling that idea.
