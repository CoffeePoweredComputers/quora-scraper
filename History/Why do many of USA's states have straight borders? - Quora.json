            "answer_text": "Because the borders were drawn up by invaders. The immigrants from Europe had no attachment to any particular area, so they just used straight lines to make it easier for them. Sometimes, they peacefully used rivers to divide the land among themselves. See, for them each parcel was extra land. So, it didn\u2019t particularly matter. Also, I find the vocabulary used to describe US interesting: There is a province in Canada named \u201cNewfoundland\u201d. I am sure there were people living there, but to incoming Europeans it was \u201cnew\u201d land. Similarly, \u201cOld World\u201d, \u201cNew World\u201d, calling places \u201ccolonies\u201d, calling European mass immigrants, \u201csettlers\u201d. This is also true for some areas in Africa, for similar reasons. Just read about USA history on Wikipedia. It is extremely interesting! ",
