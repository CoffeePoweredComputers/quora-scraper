            "answer_text": "TL; DR for the same reason the US Army lost the Vietnam war. Because no army has ever won against another when completely surrounded, with all supplies coming in by planes targeted by DCA - this tactic actually worked for the French in Na San, but this time the Viet Minh had buried their own DCA in mountain caves which made them close to impossible to dislodge. On top of that, the Viet Minh had the higher ground, and had learned from their mistakes during the battle of Na San. The French generals hadn\u2019t considered possible that heavy artillery pieces could be transported through the jungle so fast, nor that the Viet Minh had the hardware necessary to do so. They were right - the Viet Minh didn\u2019t have hardware, they had people, and they moved everything on foot or on specially modified bicycles. They also got a little bit of Chinese help and some Russian hardware. What the Viet Minh learned at Dien Bien Phu was used massively against the US army during the Vietnam war. But, contrary to the Viet Minh learning from the Na San defeat, The US didn\u2019t learn anything from their ally\u2019s loss in Dien Bien Phu; the Viet Minh won the Vietnam war using the same techniques.

            "answer_text": "The French were in a valley and not on a hill. They didn\u2019t expect that the Viet Minh would perform the monumental task of dragging their heavy guns through the jungle but that is what the Viet Minh did, and they outgunned the French. The Viet Minh surrounded the base, greatly outnumbered the French, and held the base under siege. The Viet Minh brought in anti-aircraft artillery and made it so the French couldn\u2019t resupply the base or evacuate their wounded. The French inflicted heavy casualties on the Viet Minh but the French outposts fell. France asked the US to intervene with airstrikes including B-29 Superfortress bombers but US President Dwight D. Eisenhower refused. Viet Minh trenches and tunnels were dug closer and closer to the base. On May 7th, 1954, 25,000 Viet Minh attacked and the base fell. Over 11,000 French prisoners were taken. Following their defeat at Dien Bien Phu, France signed the Geneva Accords in July, 1954. ",
