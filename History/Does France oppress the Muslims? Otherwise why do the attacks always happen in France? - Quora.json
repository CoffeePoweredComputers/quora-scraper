            "answer_text": "Islamic terrorists do not avenge poor, innocent and oppressed Muslims. They kill random civilians, including Muslims. There are several important points to consider: Most of the terrorist attacks target Muslim countries (and not France).Despite a significant bias in media coverage, most of the attacks occur in Muslim countries, on Muslim civilians: Isis responsible for more Muslim deaths than western victims The reason why France seems more affected is because, unfortunately, the media pay more attention to attacks in western countries than in African and Asian coutries. 2. The problem with Muslim communities in France is mostly social, not really religious France has a colonial history that explains the existence of strong relationships with Northern African countries. Although immigration from these countries was actively promoted a few decades ago, the economic changes in the countries made integration difficult for the Muslim communities. Same goes with current migrations from the Middle East: the religion of immigrants does not really matter, as the problem is a political failure in integrating large communities from a different culture. 3. Terrorists attack France because France strikes them (hard), not Muslims in general France has been involved in military operations agains terrorists groups in the Middle East (e.g. Syria) and Africa (e.g. Mali). France is one of the countries that spends the most military resources to crush terrorism, along with the US, the UK (and maybe Russia?). Therefore, France is a direct threat to ISIS and its affiliated networks. The only interventions against Islam in France are directed against radical versions of Islam, that are considered as incompatible with the moral basis of the Republic. For example, the state closed mosques that were involved in the radicalization and the recruitment of members for terrorists networks. See \u201cThree mosques shut down in anti-terror raids as officers seize 330 war weapons\u201d. This is motivated by security, just like any other organization promoting hatred, violent action, racial crimes etc. would be considered as a threat to national saftey. In parallel, new mosques open every year, and almost 5 million Muslims live their faith in freedom and peace in France. 4. France is easy to attack. Compared to the US or the UK (which would be the other two best targets for islamic terrorists) France is easy to access from the outside (because of the Schengen space) and from the inside (there are lots of Muslim communities that maintain social links abroad, making them easy preys for indocrination) 5. France is a symbol. Historically France has had a major role in developing the moral basis of modern western societies; the first version of the declaration of human rights was written in France in the 18th century and France has always been a fierce advocate of fundamental human rights in the world; France is therefore a symbol of everything that terrorists want to destroy. So, no, France is not targeted because it oppresses Muslims. It is targeted because it is a free country that refuses to cave in to the terrorist threat. ",

Last year Brunei king said, \"if anyone is caught celebrating Christmas at a public place, he'll face consequence and may spend rest of his life behind the bars.\" So, Muslims are getting what they do not allow to other religions. French Council of the Muslim Faith France is one of most secular nation in the world. And it has always accepted different values. France has been attacked - It has the largest number of Muslims in Western Europe, and official numbers says 5-10 percent, but in reality the number is much larger. And perhaps the only country in Europe which is very aggressive against ISIS. So they're radicalizing some weak brains and inevitable is going on. And if you're talking about attacks, I'm surprised you forgot what happened couple of weeks ago in Bangladesh - Which is an islamic nation. Any Surprises? Also if they can kill people in the month of Ramadan, what would one expect from them? So, the bottom line is they just want benefit it doesn't matter even if it comes at the cost of a Muslim. We cannot compare these ill-fated brains to the whole community. Especially when they have no hesitation to kill some of their own people.
