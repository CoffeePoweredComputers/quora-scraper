            "answer_text": "Romans were ethnocentric; groups most like themselves were familiar so easier to relate to. They were aware that Greeks and Etruscans were older civilized people; they also had some respect for Jews as having an old religion with old texts even without knowing how old. Their criticism of others was partially ignorance and partially reflexive of people just a bit strange; Eastern Mediterranean religions brought home by soldiers were suspect. People whose dress or ways seemed less martial might be seen as a bit effete; after all, if the Romans defeated them, they couldn\u2019t be quite much to respect, right? Some like the Greeks were too impressive to use that argument. Gauls and Germans were un-Roman due to stranger customs; think of men wearing dresses now: the Germans wore trousers. They did expect people to Romanize, and many did. Oppida in Gaul and Spain were acculturation places. Some Germans wanted \u201cin\u201d, too, and if they went to baths and spoke Latin weren\u2019t viewed as too strange. So yes like ethnocentrics everywhere the more akin to Romans were viewed as less strange. ",

            "answer_text": "From 300 BC until 91 BC Italy was composed of a conglomeration of city states with Rome being one amongst many,slowly,it began to expand and conquer these city states first with the Etruscans cities of nearby Veii and Caisra first by the Italics later by Rome.Rome began to expand and conquer the etruscan federation and the Italic federation city by city and each city was won part of the treaty was that they would supply an army to Rome upon request the city was to be known as a soci or ally of Rome but it did not confer any special previlages to the associated city. As Rome continued expansion,with a greater army composed of these allies they began to dislike the one sided treaties with Rome and began to clamour for a more equal standing vis a vis with the Roman Republic which lead in 91BC to the beginning of the Social war in which some allies and not others united in war over these and other issues such as full participation in Roman politics the war lasted for five years until 87 bc with Romans winning but it was so costly that Rome gave in to their demands.Cisalpine Gaul was not considered part of Italy until Julius Caesar\u2019s Reforms of 42 bc known as the Acta Caesaris. The results of the Socii war was that the Italian Peninsula became cohesive Rome accepted the other nation states as parts of its hegemony and the allies recieved equality something that Rome did not want to offer to them in the first place.
