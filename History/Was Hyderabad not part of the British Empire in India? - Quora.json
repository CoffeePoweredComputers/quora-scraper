            "answer_text": "The British ruled India with two administrative systems. One was \u2018Provinces\u2019 and the other \u2018Princely States\u2019. About 60% of the Indian sub-continent's territory were Provinces and 40% were Princely States. Provinces were British territories completely under British control. Princely States were states not directly ruled by the British but a local ruler subject to a subsidiary alliance.The doctrine of subsidiary alliance was introduced by Lord Wellesley British Governor General in India from 1798 to 1805. Early in his governorship Wellesley adopted a policy of non-intervention in the princely states, but he later adopted the policy of forming subsidiary alliances. This policy was to play a major role in British expansion in India. According to the term of this alliance, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed force . They were to be protected by the company, but had to pay for the 'subsidiary forces' that the company was supposed to maintain for the purpose of this protection. If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, then part of their territory was taken away as penalty.  Figure 1 Princely States are marked Green, British India is marked Red. There were officially 565 princely states in India at the time of independence in 1947, but the great majority had contracted with the Viceroy of India to provide public services and tax collection. Only 21 major ones had actual state governments, and among them only four were large .They wereHyderabad   Figure 2:Hyderabad is in dark Green   Figure 3:Blue boundary showing Mysore Baroda  Figure 4:Baroda   Figure 5:Jammu and Kashmir They acceded to one or other of the two new independent nations of India and Pakistan between 1947 and 1949.
