            "answer_text": "The Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, 1914  Though there have been many historic assassinations: John F. Kennedy, Mahatma Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln, Yitzhak Rabin, Martin Luther King Jr, etc., nothing has changed the course of our world as the assassination of Archduke Farnz Ferdinand. The assassination was directly responsible for the onset of World War I, which lasted 4 years, claimed the lives of 16 million people, wounding another 20 million, and setting a precedent for World War II. Let\u2019s dig a bit deep into the circumstances leading to the assassination, the assassination itself and the aftermath: 1 . Europe\u2019s Arms Race (1880s\u20131910s): The beginning of 20th century saw the great nations of Europe jostling for supremacy by strengthening their militaries. The two leading rivels were Germany and Britain. In 1906, Britain intensified the arms race by introducing HMS Dreadnought, the world\u2019s first modern battleship. Powered by steam turbines and armed with large deck guns, the Dreadnought was the new technological terror of the seas and the great envy of the rival Germany.  In response, Germany spared no expense building a modern navy to match Britain\u2019s. Russia, France, Austro-Hungary all followed suit, spending heavily on new weaponry, and creating massive, conscripted armies. 2. Allies and Enemies(1880s-1910s): As imperial powers of Europe competed to have the biggest and best militaries, alliances begin to form. Germany, Austro-Hungary and Italy had joined in a triple alliance in 1882, which pitted them against France and Britain in the west and Russia in the east. In response France, Britain and Russia formed a triple alliance in 1907.  Both alliances obliged their members to support each other if attacked by a hostile power, and they set stage for events that followed Archduke Ferdinand\u2019s assassination. 3. The assassination (June 1914): Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie were enjoying their wedding anniversary as the couple drove through the streets of Sarajevo on the morning of June 28, 1914. Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian empire, was visiting the Bosnian capital to open a museum and inspect his troops. However, not everyone was pleased about the archduke\u2019s visit. Bosnia had been annexed by Austria-Hungary in 1908, and many members of it\u2019s Serbian population sought independence thorough revolution. While the archduke and Sophie waved to well-wishers from their open-top car, several Siberian nationalists put their plot to assassinate the archduke into action. As the royal motorcade drove past their supporters, a Serbian assassin threw a bomb at the archduke\u2019s car. However, the bomb missed its intended target and instead hit the car following behind. Seeing their plan had foiled, the rattled conspirators quickly dispersed into the crowd. After taking a break, the archduke insisted on visiting those who had been injured by the bomb and the royal couple once again took to their vehicle. However, their driver had not been informed of their changed itinerary and had to reverse his car into a side road to turn around. By a bizarre twist of fate, this happened to be the same road where one of the conspirators, Gavrilo Princip, was sitting at a cafe. As the archduke\u2019s driver tried to find the correct gear, Princip crossed the road and fired two shots into the royal car. One of the bullets hit Sophie in her abdomen and the other hit archduke in his neck. Both were dead by the time the car reached hospital.  4. On the Brink of War (1914): The assassination sparked outrage across Europe. Following the assassination, Austro-Hungary demanded that Serbia hand his killer over or face military action. Germany backed up this threat, promising to follow Austro-Hungary into war if necessary. Russia, however, vocalized its support for Serbia. France and Britain were obligated by the terms of Triple Entente (alliance) to follow Russia, while Italy would have to support Germany and Austro-Hungary. Europe was now involved in a crises that threatened to spark a war between its nations. The people of the Europe held their breath.  5. War is declared (1914): On July 28, 1914, Austro-Hungary carried out its promise against Serbia by bombing Belgrade. This officially began the First World War. Russia quickly mobilized its army in support of Serbia. In August, Germany declared war on Russia and then on France, after the French army mobilized to support Russia. Britain then declared war on Germany. Italy responded to the various declarations of aggression by dropping out of the Triple Alliance altogether. Fronts were established and fights broke out across Europe as millions of young soldiers from both sides were mown down to death in the first ever use of trench warfare. 6. The effects of War (1914\u20131918): Although many hoped that the war would be over by Christmas of 1914, they were sadly mistaken. Lasting over four years, the First World War would go on to claim 16 million lives, and wounded 20 million more. In Oct 1918, a series of attacks known as \u2018The Hundred Days\u2019 Offensive\u2019 ends in the allied victory of the war. Germany signed an armistice in Oct 10 1918 officially ending the war according to the terms laid out by Allies. This was followed by Treaty of Varsallies, which imposed huge war reparations on Germany. The terms of the treaty created a resentment among Germans, which added to the rise of Nazi Germany, and consequently World War II. 7. Aftermath: World War I left its mark on the word and changed the course of history. It caused: the downfall of major monarchies of Europe: Germany, Turkey, Austro-Hungary and Russia.changed the economical balance of the world leaving European countries in deep debt and making the U.S. the leading industrial power and creditor in the world,Influenza. With troops travelling all over the world, it was spread easily and an epidemic started which killed more than 25 million people across the world,the end of colonialism, as the people became more nationalistic and the one country after the other started colonial revolts in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa.Sources: Flashpoints in History by Ben Hubbard (2016-01-07): Amazon.com: BooksAssassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand - WikipediaHMS Dreadnought (1906) - WikipediaEffects of World War 1 - HistoryStock Photo - 2 G55 P1 1914 56 E Personification of Triple Entente History World War One Propaganda Paris Petrograd Londres contre Berlin Sold",

            "answer_text": "I see what every one is thinking, every one is thinking about big events, important people, and tools like fire and sticks and stones, which is admirable. Yet one thing that, in my opinion has helped the Human race more than anything, yes- it is our large brains. This change helped us remember where things were, creativity, most importantly; understanding. When Ganges Khan, the Roman Empire, the British Empire, any and all empires, inventors, philosophers.... In my opinion all religions are a philosophy so that includes Jesus, Moses, the Buddha, Mohammad and so on... The one thing they all relied on and heavily relied on was, is, and will always be our ability to communicate through writing, and most importantly verbal communication and the desire to spread our thoughts, ideas and opinions onto others, sometimes forcibly created by our big brains. Without these simple yet complex abilities of communication, that we take for granted every day, we would still be living without fire, tools, clothes or even poorly placed jokes in an answer on Quora.... \"But maybe if we couldn't communicate girls would like me more...\" Without our large brains to communicate there would be no enemies we would need to build the a-bomb to destroy with, there would be no passing of the simplest information of: don't pick your nose in public it isn't polite. Monkeys will do this, dogs will like their gonads anywhere they please. The greatest event that happened to the humans is the day the brain evolved and the first man or woman... Probably was a woman... Thought and said; \"Hey, son, stop picking your nose the hairy girl over there will think it unbecoming of you and put your pants on and take her a flower!\" This helped procreation and the spread this special ability and most importantly knowledge, skills and understanding from previous generations. There are other species that humans have theorized have the ability to communicate not just with scent or dance but with a vocal vocabulary: dolphins for example and... I think there is a bird that verbally communicates called the Lyrebird in Malaysia but really it just copies other sounds it has heard and the uses them to attract mates but... The humans' ability to not just mimic sounds but also use those sounds to spread very complex ideas to others has change the face of this world in uncountable ways, far more than any single person, event or tool. We build technology today just for this purpose, we even feel that with better communication our world will improve. Now this questions is: what event has most changed human history? Obviously it is the evolution of the ability to communicate, in any form. We all know, the victor writes the history books. So the known history is all learned through study, hard work and spread by communication. How those that have uncovered history choose to relate that information to others effects how others react to the information. Simple, yet elegant I feel. Poetry, stories, inspirational speeches have all done great and terrible things- gotten me a wonderful wife, genocide, as well as but not limited to the creation of great civilizations. Speeches have inspired hard work that put man on the moon, words taught and inspired three hundred soldiers to fend off ten thousand, words are hopefully influencing you to believe my argument that communication is the most important event in human history. :) So go out and communicate! Not just through technology though, face to face. Share and debate a complex idea with others. Be a radical talking monkey that doesn't pick its nose in public! Anything less would be uncivilized! ",

            "answer_text": "Many of the major turning points in world history involve money and disease. Revolutions predominantly arise in times of financial crisis.  Central Asian rats and European Renaissance In the middle of the 14th century, there was a strain of plague that started in the steppes Central Asia. It so happened that the Mongols were also busy traveling and fighting at that same time. The Mongols inadvertently spread that disease around the world. The Black Death: The Greatest Catastrophe Ever. It first went to China and then to India and through trade routes went to Middle East and later to Europe.  It was greatest disaster world has ever seen - a quarter of the world population was gone. Europe had lost 60% of its people and some countries in Europe lost as many as 90%. Imagine living in a world where 9 out of your 10 friends die of the same disease. Empires around the world were ruthlessly shaken. Think of it as the Ebola of their time. However, the massive depopulation meant that the surviving peasants had more lands to cultivate and that resulted in more incomes. There was suddenly social mobility. In parallel, people also started innovating machines to reduce the need for labor. Since families were decimated, laws of inheritance were changed in many places to give daughters also their inheritance rights. Since the Churches tried to take care of the diseased, the priests died in great numbers leading to a religious vacuum. A combination of these factors led to the Renaissance and eventually colonialism. Consequences of the Black Death Small navigation issue that led to the Great War On 28th June 1914, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne was visiting Sarajevo in Bosnia. A few Yugoslavan nationalists wanted Austria to pull out of that region so that Serbia, Bosnia and other slavic people can unite.  There were 6 assassins who were sent to kill the Archduke and were set up at various points of his route. The motorcade carrying the Archduke took a wrong turn at one point and thus had to take a reverse. Unfortunately, this reversing happened close to one of assassins Princip, who had enough time to then take an aim and shoot the Archduke. If the car was traveling in its full pace, the Archduke might have escaped. Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. That led to the World War I (Balaji Viswanathan (\u0baa\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0b9c\u0bbf \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0ba8\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0ba9\u0bcd)'s post in History of the World)  Russian Revolution and 1905 Russo-Japanese war At the start of the 20th century, Russia and Japan had a major dispute on the use of ports (especially Port Arthur) around Manchuria and Korea. The resulting Russo-Japanese War would set off that century and a defining moment in world history.  Russian Empire's expansion was halted and Japan pulled a shocking victory. After a long time of subjugation, it was one of the first victories by an Asian power. That provided a great boost to Japan and helped it form alliances with the European powers.  Russia on the other had was deeply hurt. Its pride was gone and its monarchy was weakened. Militaries mutinied and people revolted in the Revolution of 1905. This would eventually lead to the 1917 Russian revolution when the Czar, weakened & distracted by the World War, would be finally thrown away.  American Revolutionary war and Seven Years' War Between 1754 and 1763, Britain and France fought a brutal war for the dominance over north America. This totally exhausted both the armies and depleted the finances.  Since the war ensured the power of the British colonies in North America, the King wanted the colonials to pay for the war. Thus, he brought in new taxes. As we have earlier seen, revolutions comes from financial troubles and people don't want to pay money when they don't have.  The attempt to increase tax led to the rise of American revolutionary war. French Revolution and American War of Independence The American revolutionary war indirectly led to the French revolution. First, the government under Louis XVI was nearly bankrupt due to the expenditure the French made to help the Americans defeat their archrivals - British. This financial crisis led them to explore for more taxes and also bring the upcoming middle classes to the discussion table. This middle class bourgeoisie would then topple the table when they realized that they were being sidelined in the middle.  The American war also infused in people a sense of hope and a sense of liberty. Revolutions are like common colds; when one kid in the class catches cold, everyone catches it. Ideas spread very fast.

            "answer_text": "These are ten events from the Twentieth Century that changed the world in a very significant way. It includes the sparks which started major wars and revolutions \u2013 affecting the lives of millions of people across the globe. Assassination of Archduke F. Ferdinand and Outbreak of World War I \u2013 June 28, 1914 In 1914, Europe was a tinderbox of tension and military rivalry. The spark for war could have been many incidents; but, as it happened the assassination of an Austrian Archduke \u2013 Franz Ferdinand by a Serb provoked widespread declarations of war and the fulfilment of treaties which led to the horrendous conflict of the First World War.  The war was to last four years and cost the lives of millions of men and women from all corners of the world. Russian Revolution 1917 25 October 1917 \u2013 Start of October Uprising by Bolsheviks  Trotsky (left) Lenin (centre) Since the publication of Marx\u2019s Communist Manifesto, there had been sporadic Communist revolutions in European countries, but nothing had really succeeded. But in October 1917, the Bolshevik revolution, led by Lenin, brought about a radical new form of government with worldwide implications. Lenin was a fervent Marxist and wasted little time in implementing his version of a \u2018dictatorship of the Proletariat\u2019. Communist Russia divided the world. It was seen by some as an alternative to the inequities of Capitalism and by others as an embodiment of totalitarianism and lack of freedom. German Invasion of Poland 1st September 1939  German and Russian soldiers Poland-1939 On 1st September 1939, Hitler\u2019s Nazi Germany invaded Poland, ostensibly for \u2018lebensraum\u2019 and to redress the imbalances of the Treaty of Versailles. The invasion of a sovereign nation finally convinced the allies \u2013 Great Britain and France of Hitler\u2019s wider intentions for the occupation of Europe. After appeasing Hitler over Austria and Czechoslovakia, Poland proved the final straw and on September 3rd, 1939, Great Britain declared war on Nazi Germany. The Second World War was to last until May 1945, costing the lives of approximately 50 million people. Less well known is that under a secret Nazi-Soviet pact the Soviet Union also occupied parts of Poland at the same time as Germany\u2019s invasion. Pearl Harbour 1941  Pearl Habour December 7, 1941 \u201cA day that will live in infamy\u201d \u2013 President Franklin D. Roosevelt In 1941, the axis powers held a supremacy over Europe and parts of Asia. Great Britain stood undefeated, but, without the strength to win against an overpowering enemy. The bombing of Pearl Harbour led to the escalation of the world war into the Pacific arena and also brought American into war with both Japan and Germany. Three years later, it was American troops who provided the majority of the manpower in the liberation of occupied Europe. Atomic Bomb Hiroshima  August 6, 1945 The US atomic bombs of 1945, devastated the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The devastation finally brought the Japanese to surrender, bringing to an end a fierce and costly Pacific war. The surrender of Japan had at one time seen unthinkable. But, the atomic bomb hastened the Japanese surrender. The atomic bomb had implications beyond just the end of the Second World War. It showed the world the potential devastation a third world war could cause. Even now the legacy of Hiroshima and the threat of nuclear war hangs over the world. Indian Independence 1947  Nehru\u2019s Trust with destiny speech, 1947 15 August 1947 India had stood as the crowning jewel in the crown of the British Empire. It was the second most populous nation in the world. After many years denying Indian calls for independence, Britain finally agreed to full Indian independence in 1947. Indian independence was accompanied by a painful separation and the birth of a new nation \u2013 Pakistan. The separation led to painful incidences of sectarian violence and killing; it led to the migration of many millions of people who found themselves on the wrong side of the border. The independence of India also created a newly independent nation which claimed allegiance to neither the US or the Soviet Union \u2013 but a third way as Nehru called it. With economic development, India has the potential to become a new superpower in the coming century. The Establishment of Maoist China  October 1, 1949 In the aftermath of the Second World War, China was involved in a bitter civil war between the Communists led by Mao Tse Tung, and the Nationalists by Chiang Kai-shek. On October 1st, 1949, the triumphant Communist Party established the People\u2019s Republic of China. This created another powerful Communist State in the most populated country in the world. The Communist hold on power profoundly influenced the lives of the Chinese who suffered under the great famine of the 1960s and Cultural Revolution of the 60s and 70s. Even now, the Chinese Communist party retains strong political power \u2013 even if it has adapted its economic policies. Assassination of John F Kennedy November 22, 1963  One of the most shocking and unexpected moments of world history. John F Kennedy had been President since his election in 1960. He was young, liberal and Catholic and had inspired many with his positive vision of the world. \u201cMy fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you \u2014 ask what can you do for your country.\u201d (JFK from Inauguration speech Jan 1961) After his assassination, Lyndon Johnson became President and American involvement in Vietnam grew, leading to a bitter conflict that came to divide America. Although Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for the assassination, evidence points to a wider conspiracy and the involvement of more than one lone gunmen. Fall of the Berlin Wall November 9, 1989  For decades, the Berlin wall had stood as a symbol of the \u2018Iron Curtain\u2019 splitting West and Eastern Europe. On the one side Communist authoritarian states, on the other side liberal democracies. The wall had been built to prevent East Germans escaping into West Germany, and indeed many had been shot trying to escape. But, more than anything else its presence was symbolic. The fall of the Berlin wall was an iconic moment when the Soviet Union gave up its grip on Eastern Europe. In the 50s and 60s, the Soviet Union had sent tanks to quell independence movements in Hungary and then Czechoslovakia. But, this time, Mikhail Gorbachev, the proponent of Perestroika and Glasnost approved the request for freedom. 9/11 Terrorist attacks 11th September 2001 The US had experienced sporadic terrorist attacks before. But, the sheer audacity and scale of these terrorist attacks shocked the US and the world. The loss of life was estimated at just under 3,000. The event changed American foreign policy. It was a motivating factor behind the controversial invasion of Iraq and led to a \u2018war on terror\u2019 symbolised by Guantanamo Bay and a debate over the justification of torture.  Undoubtedly, there are other significant world-changing events we could have included. For example, other world-changing events The stock Market crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression.Dunkirk and the escape of the British army.Battle of BritainOperation Barbarossa and the invasion of Russia.Creation of State of IsraelIranian RevolutionFreedom of Nelson Mandela from jail in South Africa.",

            "answer_text": "In this context we are speaking of publications, the written word. In reference to American publications there are various things that have changed over the last 150 years. For one thing, histories of the past were generally authored by those with a familial connection to the past; this at a time when community status was not only relevant but economically necessary. It\u2019s no coincidence that those families most senior in the community were also those most established, since they were generally the descendants of early proprietors. It\u2019s also no coincidence that those closest to the reigning polity sought to enhance status through reverence for the past; as the living representatives of those families responsible for the then, here and now, they justly claimed some right of adoration. And who did such status most appeal to? And who played a central role in the social organization of historic preservation? Well, women, of course. And who did these women most revere? That\u2019s right, those who authored those histories that served to validate. Thus there is often an element of the prideful contained in past historic writings. And as typical of the times - style itself having descended unto them from Increase Mather, although somewhat evolved - they generally employed what I have labeled, more \u201cflowery\u201d language. What is most significant to past historical writers is that they were closer to the past. That which then existed in living memory has long since been lost to both time and the demise of community. What this also means is that they often had greater access to primary source documents; many of those mentioned in historical writings even as late as the 1940s have long since disappeared, as sold to private collectors, or simply destroyed. There is also the little matter of insight; those who were closer to the past, often offer insight otherwise unavailable. There are many different ways to approach history - there are ecological histories, archaeological histories, intellectual histories; there are events which serve as historic markers, key individuals, prime movers, who play vital roles; there are also communities and genealogies. The study of America is largely a study of communities, of those microcosms that comprise the whole, from these we extract generalities that form the basis of opinion. How has historical writing changed? Well, I think more is produced today by academia; some of it is quite scholarly, some of it is just pure crap. Hermeneutics is impossible to avoid but consider the political bias of many in America today; do you really suppose they present accurate evaluation? Primarily because they discard the historian\u2019s primary tenet - and that is this - we begin at the beginning and we go until we reach the end. We don\u2019t, as many do today, begin with present precepts and prejudicial perspective and work backwards; to evaluate history, in my opinion, means traveling back in time with a blank slate to move forward. It\u2019s the only way we can evaluate those events, those forks in the road, those choices, that determine the direction of cultural mindset. ",

He is \u201cFrederick Trump\u201d. Does his second name (Trump) ring any bell? He is the grandfather of the incumbent President of US.  The story goes like this: 1) Frederick Trump was born on 14 March 1869 in Kallstadt, Kingdom of Bavaria 2) he emigrated to the United States at the age of 16 and started working as a barber 3) He emigrated to avoid fulfilling his military service 4) After a see-saw career in US, he returned to his native country in 1904 5) On 24 December 1904 the Department of Interior announced an investigation to expel Trump from Germany: Reason given was that he emigrated to avoid his military-service obligations in Germany 6) This lead to the loss of German citizenship for Trump 7) He and his family returned to New York on 30 June 1905 Their son Fred was born on 11 October 1905 and Fred fathered the current president of US, DONALD TRUMP.  So we could safely say that cheating is in the blood of Trumps but they are great enough to convert the adversaries into the opportunities ",

            "answer_text": "The Battle of Tours-Poitiers Leading up to the battle in 732 CE, the Roman Empire had collapsed back in 476 CE and the German tribes had taken over most of mainland Europe, including the Iberian Peninsula. Meanwhile, Islam had spread quickly through Africa, as an appealing \u201ceveryone can be included\u201d religion and as a military force not to be reckoned with. Islamic generals set their sights on conquest in Europe and had a pretty easy time of it at first, blazing through the Iberian Peninsula in eight ye to the border of the Frankish kingdom at the Pyrenees Mountains. The Muslim General Tariq ibn-Ziyad set his sights on moving Northeast across the Pyrenees, into France, and then across all of Europe. After crossing the Pyrenees into Frankland, he made it into Aquitane. And, between the cities of Poitiers and Tours, he met the army of Charles \u201cThe Hammer\u201d Martel of the Franks. During the battle, the Muslim leader Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi, Governor-General of al-Andalus, was killed and the Franks subsequently extended their power to the south while stopping the Muslim invasion from spreading to the north.  Charles de Steuben's Bataille de Poitiers en Octobre 732 depicts Charles Martel (mounted) facing Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi (right) at the Battle of Tours. How did this change the course of human history, you may ask? Think of western society and how deeply rooted it is in Christianity.  Can you imagine Europe without St. Peter\u2019s Square, Vatican City (designed and built 1656\u20131667)? If Islam had won the Battle of Tours-Poitiers, Europe would be an Islamic world rather than a Christian one. All of Europe\u2019s history would be completely different, following different rules of a different religion, creating a different world from what we live in. We westerners live in a Christian world because Charles \u201cThe Hammer\u201d Martel won The Battle of Tours-Poitiers. ",

            "answer_text": "Reformation and renaissance movement in Europe. I believe that many major changes in the world in past 500 years were result or outcome of some event or action in Europe, which eventually were result of the awakening of Europe. Renaissance started the era of re consolidation and growth in sphere of art and culture, technology and machines, methods of warfare and so on. Colonialism in Asia, Europe and Africa was started by Europeans after they had recovered from dark ages and wanted to spread their hegemony over the world. America was discovered as part of this desire, India and Africa were captured and to some extent, developed due to colonisationIndustrial revolution started in Europe as a result of their desire to be prosperous by developing their industrial output and increasing efficiency and quality of production. We owe the modern age of industrialisation, heavy building machines, textiles production, steel industries etc. to European ingenuity.Renaissance restarted the lost tradition of art and theatre and poems - the precursor to today's booming entertainment, movie , animation and music industryOrigin of arms race: The European rivalries ( Britain vs France ) started the production of large ships and guns, thus kick-starting the age of heavy machine weapons of modern warfare. Taking this a little further, I will extrapolate this and suggest that the current arms race to develop nuclear weapons is a consequence of this rivalry.Development of Science & technology: Copernicus and Galileo- the geniuses of Astrology were Europeans. Newton - father of modern physics was European. Edison. Darwin - the founder of theory of natural selection, Alexandar Fleming ( discoverer of penicillin) ,Graham bell ( inventor of telephone) were all British and by extension European. Renaissance era gave a major boost to science and discovery and all major inventions post this naturally involved Europeans.Connectivity: Railways and telegrams were all invented as it was required to communicate messages and transport material across long distances, much needed in European colonies for coordination with country and trade.Heavy industrialisation and labor intensive industries developed - which eventually led to exploitation of labor, and thus was the reason behind the thoughts of Communism, and Socialism. Hope I am not doing any offence by suggesting that the two philosophies that have troubled the European world most, have actually been developed in Europe itself.World Wars: This one is probably the most controversial point i have ever made on this platform. But, i believe that the awakening of Renaissance lead to development of several European nation and a desire to spread their hegemony and domination over the world, including Europe. This battle eventually culminated in World War I and II, leading to deaths of around 70 - 80 million people around the world.Just want to make a honest submission - i like to connect dots, and suggest interconnection of various events. The above answer is a product of the same habit, and while most of it is logically true - some of it may offend some readers. Excuse me if that happens. ",

He introduced policies like social security, that is still around.    3: Adolf Hitler Rises to power in Germany : No explanations needed for this. In a way the Great depression aided Hitler coming to power.   4.  Atomic bomb was dropped in Japan :   5. Mao Zedong comes to power in China :   6. Cold war ends. Not with a bang, thankfully.

            "answer_text": "11th-century publication of \u201cThe Incoherence of the Philosophers\u201d by Persian Islamic theologian al-Ghazali  Next to the Bible, there has probably not been a single document published in human history which has caused as much mass suffering as this one. In the Arab world of the Islamic Golden Age, Aristotle was referred to by name as Aristutalis or Aristu, although when quoted he was often referred to by a sobriquet such as 'the wise man' or \u2018the First Teacher\u2019. Famous Arab philosopher Ibn Rushd, known in the West as Averroes, was the last great Arabophone commentator on Aristotle, writing numerous treatises on his works. Later, transmission of these works to Christian Europe allowed Aristotelianism to flourish in the scholastic period. By A.D. 800, Islam had spread throughout parts of the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Europe. This diverse domain had access to philosophies, cultural experiences, and resources that enabled it to be the world\u2019s hub of science and knowledge for 300 years. This crucially included the writings of Aristotle, left behind in Persia by earlier the all-conquering armies of Alexander the Great, a pupil of Aristotle. However in his 11th-century document, The Incoherence of the Philosophers, Al-Ghazali refuted Ancient Greek philosophy as lacking a foundation in Islam. He disdained the state of philosophy in the Muslim world. Philosophers, he insisted, would be wrong as long as they undermined God\u2019s authority and denied basic Islamic beliefs with their questions and concepts. Al-Ghazali\u2019s writings helped influence the mindset of Muslims against the philosophies of the Golden Age, turning the once economically and socially advanced Muslim world away from it\u2019s leading position in philosophy and science, instead focussing attention towards divine mystical experience and opening the gate for politcal power concentrated in the hands of narrow-minded religious fanatics which continues to the present day in the form of General Zia, Ayatollah Khomeini, ISIS, Taliban, Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Battle of Milvian Bridge In 312 CE, the Roman Empire was engulfed in civil war. Fighting for control in the Western half was Maxentius, who held Italy, Sicily and the African providence and Constantine, who controlled Britain, Gaul, the Germanic provinces, and Spain. After several defeats in Northern Italy, Macentius retreated back to the safety of Rome. Constantine prepared for a siege, as Macentius had successful done this before, but instead he prepared for battle in front of the Milvian Bridge. He believed there was good omens since it was nearly the university of his coronation. The day before the battle Constantine was said to have a vision. In his vision he saw across appear in the sky and heard, \u201cin hoc signo vinces\u201d, translating to, \u201cin this sign, you will conquer.\" Constantine saw this as a sign from the Christian God for him to fight under his banner so he ordered his men to a Latin cross or the Labarum on their shields. The Battle of Milvian Bridge was fought on Oct. 27, 312 CE. Macentius had ordered the bridge to be destroyed and constructed a temporary bridge for his own army\u2019s use. Their armies were roughly the same size, but eventually Constantine\u2019s forces pushed Macentius\u2019 men back and they were forced to retreat to a last defense at Rome. When crossing the temporary bridge collapsed, splitting the fleeing army in half. Those trapped on the north bank of the Tiber River were either killed or capture. Macentius drowned and he was later decapitated. The next day, Constantine enter Rome and was the undisputed ruler of the Western half of the Empire. Macentius\u2019 head was paraded and sent to Carthage, after that they showed no more resistance. A year later Constantine would issue the Edict of Milan, which recognized and tolerated Christianity as a religion in the Empire. One his deathbed, May 22, 337 CE, Constantine was baptized. Christianity would not become the official religion of the Roman Empire until 380 CE under Theodosius I, but this battle sent Rome towards adopting the Christian faith. Was the vision an Act of God or as some researchers have stated it being meteor or sun dogs*? We may never know, but it did, for the most part, end the persecution of Christians in the Empire and the beginning of it becoming the faith in the West. 1,700 years later, Christianity is the world\u2019s largest religion with around 2.2 billion and has played a major part in history since then, whether good or evil.

            "answer_text": "Since the OP doesn't mention a time period, I'll take the liberty to start from prehistory and mention some of the subtle things that set the ball rolling to where we're today. Beginnings of science:Someone once asked when did science start. To me, it started with the advent of tool making. It's the first known instance with ample evidence which characterizes a fantastic trait of the human brain (and in this case, of the genus Homo too) -- pattern recognition! This pattern recognition and subsequent inquiry (let's call it the earliest form of scientific inquiry) almost certainly was behind taming the fire, agriculture, heating up a substance called malachite found between the rocks and finding out that it released a metal we call copper and unleashing the age of the metals. As you can see, this trait of the brain allows us to see shapes in the constellation of stars and an old lady on the moon, but it is also behind almost all early human progress. Agriculture:When we look back at civilizational history, almost everyone will agree that agriculture allowed our ancestors to give up a nomadic life and that freed up a lot of time for organizing society, art, language and civilizational progress. It's no coincidence that there hasn't been another ice age since the start of agriculture. Our relationship with the planet was no more of a mother-son relationship. We were beginning to take charge of our lives.  Writing: It's commonly agreed that the Sumerians gifted this world the art of writing. The practice of recording something down on a clay tablet allowed for knowledge to transcend down through generations and across civilizations and made knowledge transfer a possibility. Today, we traipse along the path of the Sumerians with the invention of the Internet and information and knowledge sharing on an industrial scale. Globalization:When Europeans came in their ships to posts in Asia and Africa, the first true wave of globalization arrived with them. This globalization brought with it the dark side of colonization and condemned millions of people to subhuman lives, but it set the ball rolling to the interconnected world we live in. Age of Enlightenment:If we have to think of a transition time between the times of the old world and the technology-filled modern world, this would be it. The reformation and the wars created an intellectual climate of questioning the old dogmas, a thirst for new technology, and investigating the natural world and unleashed a maelstrom of scientific revolutions. This period really is the bedrock of modern civilization. Too bad the great civilizations of Asia and Africa were subjugated and stood by and watched this period go by. Countries like India and China, which are competing with countries that benefited from the industrial revolution which created the infrastructure of industrial revolution, had to create both industrial and post-industrial revolution societies at the same time, a challenge not many people recognize.

They removed 700 million tons of carbon from God's not so green now earth.  Had the great Khan's armies not turned back from Europe, Christianity would have been destroyed along with Islam. The Renaissance would never come. No rise of capitalism or the middle-class. No printing press, no Dutch Revolution and no Industrial Revolution.Patrons of art like the Medici family would have been slaughtered like dogs, Galileo would not have lived. however the Mongols, one imagines might have found a use for Leonardo due to his ability to build awesome war machines.   He was called the Oceanic Warrior as his empire stretched from ocean to ocean. He established the world's richest empire and the world's largest continuous empire. The battles of Medieval Europe were mostly uncoordinated barbaric attacks from one small king to the other. Khan's army did something even modern armies don't do, follow orders. He could move thousands of men at a time and direct their attacks as he wished. The world would not see an army as coordinated and disciplined as the Khan's. The famous Russian xenophobia is often attributed due to their crushing defeat and sacking at the hands of the Mongols. Once Mongols had ridden through a nation, it was never the same again. When they attacked, Afghanistan, the cities of Herat witnessed the death of hundreds of thousands of people. The economy of the region has still not recovered from the raids.The Mongols were never defeated during the time of the Khan and Ogadai. Resistance was futile, as Khan's four generals, referred to as \"hounds\" could cut down any line of defense. Each Mongol soldier could ride a horse and control another one simultaneously. Khan had already destroyed the Islamic Caliphate by having its Caliph put in a sack and trampled by horses. He did not shed the blood of the Caliph as the Caliph was a descendant of Prophet Mohammed, and Khan did not believe in spilling the blood of such men.  Sources: Wikipedia and What If ? ",

            "answer_text": "Events that changed the world These are ten events from the Twentieth Century that changed the world in a very significant way. It includes the sparks which started major wars and revolutions \u2013 affecting the lives of millions of people across the globe. Assassination of Archduke F. Ferdinand and Outbreak of World War I \u2013 June 28, 1914 In 1914, Europe was a tinderbox of tension and military rivalry. The spark for war could have been many incidents; but, as it happened the assassination of an Austrian Archduke \u2013 Franz Ferdinand by a Serb provoked widespread declarations of war and the fulfilment of treaties which led to the horrendous conflict of the First World War.  The war was to last four years and cost the lives of millions of men and women from all corners of the world. Russian Revolution 1917 25 October 1917 \u2013 Start of October Uprising by Bolsheviks  Trotsky (left) Lenin (centre) Since the publication of Marx\u2019s Communist Manifesto, there had been sporadic Communist revolutions in European countries, but nothing had really succeeded. But in October 1917, the Bolshevik revolution, led by Lenin, brought about a radical new form of government with worldwide implications. Lenin was a fervent Marxist and wasted little time in implementing his version of a \u2018dictatorship of the Proletariat\u2019. Communist Russia divided the world. It was seen by some as an alternative to the inequities of Capitalism and by others as an embodiment of totalitarianism and lack of freedom. German Invasion of Poland 1st September 1939  German and Russian soldiers Poland-1939 On 1st September 1939, Hitler\u2019s Nazi Germany invaded Poland, ostensibly for \u2018lebensraum\u2019 and to redress the imbalances of the Treaty of Versailles. The invasion of a sovereign nation finally convinced the allies \u2013 Great Britain and France of Hitler\u2019s wider intentions for the occupation of Europe. After appeasing Hitler over Austria and Czechoslovakia, Poland proved the final straw and on September 3rd, 1939, Great Britain declared war on Nazi Germany. The Second World War was to last until May 1945, costing the lives of approximately 50 million people. Less well known is that under a secret Nazi-Soviet pact the Soviet Union also occupied parts of Poland at the same time as Germany\u2019s invasion. Pearl Harbour 1941  Pearl Habour December 7, 1941 \u201cA day that will live in infamy\u201d \u2013 President Franklin D. Roosevelt In 1941, the axis powers held a supremacy over Europe and parts of Asia. Great Britain stood undefeated, but, without the strength to win against an overpowering enemy. The bombing of Pearl Harbour led to the escalation of the world war into the Pacific arena and also brought American into war with both Japan and Germany. Three years later, it was American troops who provided the majority of the manpower in the liberation of occupied Europe. Atomic Bomb Hiroshima  August 6, 1945 The US atomic bombs of 1945, devastated the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The devastation finally brought the Japanese to surrender, bringing to an end a fierce and costly Pacific war. The surrender of Japan had at one time seen unthinkable. But, the atomic bomb hastened the Japanese surrender. The atomic bomb had implications beyond just the end of the Second World War. It showed the world the potential devastation a third world war could cause. Even now the legacy of Hiroshima and the threat of nuclear war hangs over the world. Indian Independence 1947  Nehru\u2019s Trust with destiny speech, 1947 15 August 1947 India had stood as the crowning jewel in the crown of the British Empire. It was the second most populous nation in the world. After many years denying Indian calls for independence, Britain finally agreed to full Indian independence in 1947. Indian independence was accompanied by a painful separation and the birth of a new nation \u2013 Pakistan. The separation led to painful incidences of sectarian violence and killing; it led to the migration of many millions of people who found themselves on the wrong side of the border. The independence of India also created a newly independent nation which claimed allegiance to neither the US or the Soviet Union \u2013 but a third way as Nehru called it. With economic development, India has the potential to become a new superpower in the coming century. The Establishment of Maoist China  October 1, 1949 In the aftermath of the Second World War, China was involved in a bitter civil war between the Communists led by Mao Tse Tung, and the Nationalists by Chiang Kai-shek. On October 1st, 1949, the triumphant Communist Party established the People\u2019s Republic of China. This created another powerful Communist State in the most populated country in the world. The Communist hold on power profoundly influenced the lives of the Chinese who suffered under the great famine of the 1960s and Cultural Revolution of the 60s and 70s. Even now, the Chinese Communist party retains strong political power \u2013 even if it has adapted its economic policies. Assassination of John F Kennedy November 22, 1963  One of the most shocking and unexpected moments of world history. John F Kennedy had been President since his election in 1960. He was young, liberal and Catholic and had inspired many with his positive vision of the world. \u201cMy fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you \u2014 ask what can you do for your country.\u201d (JFK from Inauguration speech Jan 1961) After his assassination, Lyndon Johnson became President and American involvement in Vietnam grew, leading to a bitter conflict that came to divide America. Although Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for the assassination, evidence points to a wider conspiracy and the involvement of more than one lone gunmen. Fall of the Berlin Wall November 9, 1989  For decades, the Berlin wall had stood as a symbol of the \u2018Iron Curtain\u2019 splitting West and Eastern Europe. On the one side Communist authoritarian states, on the other side liberal democracies. The wall had been built to prevent East Germans escaping into West Germany, and indeed many had been shot trying to escape. But, more than anything else its presence was symbolic. The fall of the Berlin wall was an iconic moment when the Soviet Union gave up its grip on Eastern Europe. In the 50s and 60s, the Soviet Union had sent tanks to quell independence movements in Hungary and then Czechoslovakia. But, this time, Mikhail Gorbachev, the proponent of Perestroika and Glasnost approved the request for freedom. 9/11 Terrorist attacks 11th September 2001 The US had experienced sporadic terrorist attacks before. But, the sheer audacity and scale of these terrorist attacks shocked the US and the world. The loss of life was estimated at just under 3,000. The event changed American foreign policy. It was a motivating factor behind the controversial invasion of Iraq and led to a \u2018war on terror\u2019 symbolised by Guantanamo Bay and a debate over the justification of torture.  Undoubtedly, there are other significant world-changing events we could have included. For example, other world-changing events The stock Market crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression.Dunkirk and the escape of the British army.Battle of BritainOperation Barbarossa and the invasion of Russia.Creation of State of IsraelIranian RevolutionFreedom of Nelson Mandela from jail in South Africa.It is always hard to choose a top ten. But, this is a few we have chosen. Citation: Pettinger, Tejvan \u201cEvents that changed the World\u201d, Oxford, Source Events that changed the world ",

            "answer_text": "If we count from prehistoric time then it was when human invented how to make/control fire. At first humans are the same as other living animal. We human don't have that much advantages from other animal beside our developed brain. At first we make tools to compensate our disadvantages from animals. We make use of sharp tools to match those sharp animal's fangs. We throw projectiles so we can outfast those speedy animal. Clubs and other blunt mechanics so we can match the animal's strength. So far human have some advantages but nothing too big to make us leap ahead that far. Until we make one thing those animals don't have which is fire. By using fire human managed a lot of leaps in civilisation. By having fire we can have lots of things those animal can't do. Human can have lights at dark, heat to keep warm, also the more important thing is human can cook.By cooking we have better hygine on our meal. Making use healthier and have longer live. Human can consume foos easier by cooking it. If a cow need a few hours for consuming the grass and leaves we can consume in minutes. By having more time in live to socialize and developing culture human's civilisation was able to grow rapidly. ",

Where Fire kept humans warm during winters & freezing nights, protect from wild animals and consume cooked food from raw meat.Wheel:This is \"wheel\" of fortune, taking manhood to next level. This is the starting point for making of gears, pulleys etc. of mechanical items, finally towards building gaint machinery like Bucket Wheel Excavators Bucket-wheel excavator Finally, Foreseeing the future (Key survival/differentiation for homosapien against neanderthals):Though neanderthals survived Ice Ages, they failed to continue their existence during melt down. On the other hand, homosapiens survived in extreme climate such as drought for years at a stretch and water scarcity etc. Which resulted homosapiens to preserve water & food sources for worst days. As Andrew Brooks pointed out, homosapiens stored ostrich eggs to store water and bury it under the ground for their worst summer. This helped homosapiens outsmart other species and took the world under their control.",

The subsequent extinction of those creatures due to the impact of the Chicxulub asteroid would facilitate the evolution of new forms of life such as horses, whales and primates whose own evolutionary cycle would culminate(for some of them) in the Homo Sapien Sapien(or the human is it is commonly called). From there, we humans supplemented our superior intellects with our collaborative abilities to gain the upper hand over other animals and established ourselves as Earth\u2019s dominant species. Subsequently, we would found great civilizations and continue to become more technologically sophisticated.

            "answer_text": "Decisive battle fought between soon-to-be emperor of the Mughal Empire Aurangzeb and his elder brother Dara Shikoh comes to my mind.  One tactical, and rather immature, error committed by Dara Shikoh changed history of the Indian subcontinent forever. The end of the Mughals, rise of the British & everything that followed can be majorly attributed to this event. The repercussions of the battle can still be felt today in very subtle manner. The battle:   [Battle of Samugarh : Source] Dara Shikoh was the eldest son of Shah Jahan and hence considered to be the rightful heir to the throne. Shah Jahan had never kept his affection of Dara private and hence Dara Shikoh enjoyed good support within ranks of his father's army. As Shah Jahan's health deteriorated with age, he was considered to be the most powerful man in the empire.  Aurangzeb, Dara's younger brother, had other plans. Through his military tactics and diplomacy he secured considerable support within his father's generals (although, still smaller compared to Dara). Then he gathered troops and marched towards the capital under the pretext of meeting his ailing father. Dara decided to meet him head on and proceeded with his Military. The armies collided at a place called Samugarh. The battle, described extensively by many historians, was epic. Aurangzeb fought with brilliance and still he was no match to Military might which favored Dara. Soon both his flanks were destroyed and he was left with about a thousand of troop around him. The moment: Dara had almost made it. However, for a mysterious reason, he disembarked from his elephant as the evening approached. His troops mistakenly assumed that he was dead. Within few moments, the balance swayed. The troops switched their allegiance. Aurangzeb capitalized on the confusion. Dara's army was beaten, he fled the scene. From then onwards Aurangzeb marched to capital and his conquest ended only after all his brothers had been killed/banished, leaving him to be the sole heir to the throne. & the Repercussions: Mughal empire got a fundamentalist theocratic ruler. A century of cultural integration and prosperity was over. Everything that Akbar, Humayun and Shah Jahan had achieved was undone by Aurangzeb because of his fanaticism. Dara Shikoh himself was very secular and believed in religious harmony. He had translated Upnishads in his native Persian language. The cultural damage done by Aurangzeb was irreparable. Mughal decline started soon after his death and soon British rose to prominence, cashing in on weak Mughal rulers.  Had Dara Shikoh thought otherwise and continued for another half an hour, the history of Indian subcontinent would have bee drastically different. I have started believing that a butterfly flapping wig in one part of the world can start hurricane in the other part. Something similar has already happened to us.   Note: I found  Rulers of India: Aurangzeb, Emperor of Hindustan a very educational book which has described the rise Aurangzeb after this battle and its repercussions on Indian history. ",

Still I found it interesting so I am sharing ...... Henry Tandy was a soldier in the British Army during the World War 1. During one of his battles in French village on 28th September 1918 he came across a German soldier who was wounded and so helpless that he was not even trying to raise his rifle. For some reason Henry decides not to kill the helpless soldier and lets him go. Generally by protocol soldiers are either killed or taken POW.  I am sure by now many of you might have guessed who the German soldier was. Yup, you guessed it right. He was none other than  Adolf Hitler The man who played the main character in the World War 2.  Hitler later recognized Henry from a newspaper clipping of his and asked his men to pass on his gratitude to Henry. Just imagine for second had he killed or taken Hitler prisoner, how different the world and its history would have been. Just one different action and set of chain of events of mass murders, bombings, nuking might not have taken place.   \u200b My source: http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/henry-tandey-vc-man-who-3009915 ",

            "answer_text": "I will write one I think greatly changed the world. Short answer: The fall of Constantinople (1453).The Byzantine Empire was already a small empire due to the many territorial losses it suffered. Even so the city itself was callled by contemporary historians theologians and philosophers \"the center of the world, the eye of the ecumene\". The loss of the city was not just a territorial loss. It was a \"punch\" to the face of the western world. Remember that the western world was Christian and they lost one of their jewels.Also, when the city fell many Greek scholars fled to several European cities which helped start the Renaissance. This phenomenon was one of the greatest intellectuals movements of Europe and signalled the end of the Middle Ages.In the end, the proclamation of Constantinople as the new capital of the Ottoman Empire was a way for Islam to gain a foothold in Eastern Europe. I would dare to say that this event fueled the animosity between Greeks ans Turks. (Today, it is an animosity between extremists, at least that is how I look at it).For further reading you can try the s. Runciman - The fall of Constantinople 1453, Cambridge University Press. ",

            "answer_text": "If the colonists had lost the Revolutionary war America would probably still be under British rule. The civil war would not have happened and all the presidents throughout American history would not have existed. In fact George Washington would\u2019ve been considered as traitor just like Benedict Arnold and would\u2019ve probably hanged for his offenses. Moving on a hundred years and WWI would have completely turned on it\u2019s head and we might have seen Germany completely take over Europe. Now granted Britain would have had more troops but they would have had to travel a greater distance. In WWII Japan would not have bombed the island of Hawaii because the queen of Hawaii would still be in power. It would be safe to say that the Pacific theater of war might not have happened the way it turned out. It would have been Britain vs. Japan instead of U.S. versus Japan. Another way to look at this is that Henry Ford might not have created the model T so the automobile as we know it would have been different and manufacturing would have figured out the assembly line way later than the early 1900s. This also correlates to WWII because most of not all the equipment used in WWII was created on an assembly line so wartime production would have been slower meaning the war could have possibly lasted longer and with more stalemates. Another possibility is that Germany could have beaten Britain because they could have shipped out its weapons faster than them. Britain would have had to ship its weapons across the Atlantic which was dangerous because of the U-boats the Germans used. There is way more that could have changed but that is a short list of things that would have been affected by the colonists losing to England in the Revolutionary war. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on exactly what you mean by \u201cthroughout the years\u201d. If you take the long view - i.e. from the beginning of history itself - then it has changed substantially. I\u2019d also add that I am relatively unfamiliar with classical Chinese or Indian historians and can not speak about them with any degree of knowledge. The great classical Western historians: Polybius, Josephus, Herodotus, Livy, etc. had a very different set of objectives in writing their historical texts than do modern historians. Objectivity, per se, was not a virtue for them. They had a story to tell and to a large degree, the story was written to please their patrons, who tended to be powerful men. Medieval European historians had a tendency to write in order to further Christianity. Many were clergymen. For example, Gregoire de Tours was a bishop and he celebrated the conversion of Clovis to Christianity, the telling of which was all the same more important than getting the details of actual history right. Similar crtiicisms can be made of people like Bede. With the enlightenment, and its emphasis on objectivity and science, history itself began to change. Historians like Gibbon tried to be objective and analytical. In many respects, this was the first time that this was even considered to be an objective for history. With the enlightenment also began a process of change with respect to our morals as a species, and the social norms we live by. Today, most educated people in the world find it abhorrent, for example, to imagine that there are systematic differences in the underlying rights or capabilities of different people. Racism continues, but broad ideas of racial superiority are, at the very least, considered backwards by most. Even a hundred years ago, this was not at all the case, and that move, from belief in some kind of divinely dictated social or racial hierarchy - which was the fundamental justification for monarchical government, not to mention slavery and colonialism - has disappeared. As such, our opinions on much of our own history and the analyses we make of it have changed dramatically. One example (a rather extreme one): I live in France and am very interested in books published under the German occupation. You can find them in old yard sales and the like, sometimes. I have read a number of history books published in between 1941 and 1943 in France, and therefore approved by Nazi censors. The dates they describe for major events are true enough, but needless to say, their analysis of European history is\u2026 ahem\u2026 biased. Enough to send shivers up your spine. It is interesting and sobering to ask one\u2019s self what future generations will say about our own views of our own history. ",
