            "answer_text": "Not in any real sense. Roman slaves could often earn money on the side, a form of quasi-property called peculium, but it was up to the slave master whether or not the slave was allowed to do so and, in any case, may well have been a situation reasonably available only to skilled or educated slaves. Slaves were not legal persons under Roman law. Since they were not legal persons, they could not possess property or assets and have those possessions recognized by law. Therefore, they could not legally earn any sort of wage (or receive any kind of property) in their own right. This applied to sons, as well, by the way: a son under a paterfamilias did not legally own anything so long as he was still under the power of the paterfamilias. Instead, Romans counted an object in the possession of someone unable to hold property in their own right as a peculium. This represented an object or asset that, while technically owned by the master or father, was held, managed, and administered by the son or slave. Now, theoretically the peculium was the legal property of the master, but it seems like in practice it was almost always regarded as the effective property of the slave so long as the master was fine with it. This peculium, by the way, could be quite extensive. There are many examples of, say, a slave \u201cowning\u201d a shop in a town or city as a peculium\u2014the slave managed and for all intents and purposes owned the store, but it was originally funded by the master and legally considered his property to dispose of as he wished. Likewise, a slave in charge of managing a vast estate might find a breathtakingly vast latifundia as his peculium. The slave could even enter into business deals with their peculium on their own initiative\u2014their master, in turn, would be held legally liable. There was, in short, a surprising amount of financial and economic freedom available for some classes of Roman slave (though by no means all or even most). This concept of peculium extended to the possession of money, and it seems like it wasn\u2019t uncommon for slaves to possess some amount of cash. Often, it was earned by a slave performing odd-jobs on their own time, but a cash gift from a grateful or liberal master wouldn\u2019t have been out of the question. This is how many slaves would end up saving enough money to eventually purchase manumission. Now, we should be clear: this was not universal, and it was not required that a master pay any money whatsoever to his slaves, or even allow his slaves to possess any money whatsoever and a slave had no legal recourse if a master decided he was going to repossess the slave\u2019s \u201cbelongings.\u201d It did not reach a degree of uniformity and regularity that we would call a \u201cwage\u201d\u2014rather, it was more akin to an allowance. So, did Roman slaves earn a wage? No. In some circumstances, Roman slaves could receive cash\u2014but that cash was only ever the master\u2019s property, and would almost certainly be going ultimately to the master to purchase manumission in any case.

            "answer_text": "Slavery in the Roman era encompassed many jobs. It is mostly associated with chattel slavery where convicts and other such prisoners are basically worked to death with no wages, whereas other slaves would work much like today\u2019s professional employees- educated tutors, accountants, bodyguards, scribes, etc. were all typically filled by slaves. Roman society was very patriarchal, that is, you had a patron and a client. The majority of such relationships were between master and slave. Even if a slave was manumitted (bought or otherwise bestowed), the freed slave would simply transition from slave to a free client, usually as some sort of social or political ally. It was common to pay or at least provide such slaves since they were a valuable asset. Why would an educated Greek slave do his best to tutor your kids if you do nothing but feed him gruel and casually whip him every now and then, like he\u2019s THAT sort of slave consigned to the salt mines? You don\u2019t, you treat him like an employee- you pay fair wages. They had laws against cruel treatment of slaves. It is just that our image and categorization of modern slavery is different. To the Romans, modern employees are slaves as well as the state prisoners working the roads in chain-gangs, and kids working ten-cents an hour, 25 hour shifts in sweatshops. ",
