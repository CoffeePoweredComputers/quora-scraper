            "answer_text": "I refer you to the Michael Dobbs article in Military History Magazine entitled \u201cThe End was Near\u201d dated 2/5/2018 and to The Last Saturday of October published last year. In summary, the decision not to invade Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis rested solely with JFK, despite the American military plan to bomb the Soviet Missile Sites and invade seven days later with unanimous support of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. Quoting Dobbs: The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff presented the president with a formal recommendation to bomb the Soviet missile sites. A full-scale invasion of the island would follow within seven days. Marine units and the Army\u2019s 1st Armored Division would hit the beaches east and west of Havana, along a 40-mile front, in an operation modeled after the June 1944 D-Day landings in France. From The Last Saturday of October: I have taken steps to insure our contingency plans for Cuba are kept up to date. The Navy plans to attack SA-2 (surface to air missile) targets at low level using 4 divisions of A-4D's (4 attack bomber aircraft per division) armed with 250#, 500#, and 2000# low drag bombs and napalm\u2026the Air Force plans primary use of napalm and 20 mm cannon delivered at low level, and crews are proficient\u2026As new missile sites are located, they are picked up in the target and attack plans within a few hours of receipt of photographs. Memorandum from Secretary of Defense McNamara to President Kennedy, October 4, 1962. According to Dobbs, Kennedy\u2019s distrust of the American military ability to get things right and his aversion to all-out nuclear war left him with a risk/reward calculation that he couldn\u2019t square. He never knew that the Soviets had placed 43,000 combat troops on the island armed with 98 tactical nuclear weapons to repel the invasion, not to mention the Soviet submarines armed with nuclear-tipped torpedoes, so credit JFK\u2019s instincts and diplomacy. Finally, a quote from Dobbs taken from The Last Saturday of October: Jack Kennedy had a keen appreciation for the vagaries of history. His experiences commanding a patrol boat in the Pacific during World War II, reinforced by the lessons from the Bay of Pigs, had taught him to mistrust the assurances of military leaders. He knew that there can be a huge gulf between the orders\u2026of the man in the Oval Office and how that policy is actually implemented on the ground. One of his lasting impressions from the war was that \u201cthe military\u2026screws up everything\u201d The events of the (Cuban Missile Crisis) would confirm JFK\u2019s view of history as a chaotic process, replete with accidental figures whose role in history is often overlooked\u2026Michael Dobbs.

            "answer_text": "Kennedy made the final decision. It was supposedly based on advice from his military advisers, the Joint Chiefs and the Executive Committee of the National Security Council. In reality Ex Comm appears to have been an ad hoc group of senior officials that was, after the fact, designated as part of the NSC. Proponents of military action are often called the Hawks while those supporting the blockade and diplomacy are designated Doves. Some have termed themselves double Hawks in favour of both military options Air Strikes and Invasion. While we have extensive transcripts of Ex Comm meetings and of Kennedy's meeting with the JCS we know that Kennedy had important unrecorded discussions with his brother and probably other advisers. Robert Kennedy was an influential member of Ex Comm and he played a key role in the \"back channel\" contact with Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin. Members of Ex Comm and the JCS were unaware of this back channel. Maxwell Taylor as Chair of the JCS was a member of Ex Comm and was criticised by Le May for not pressing forcefully enough for military action. A number of individuals in Ex Comm changed their position. Both Kennedy brothers appear to have initially favoured Air Strikes. However, the military briefings made it clear that a Surgical Air Strike was impossible with the technology and limited intelligence available. Once the Surgical Air Strike option lost credibility the military option appeared to of necessity be Air Strike followed by invasion. The credibility of the JCS was crucially compromised by the humiliating failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion. This had been a huge political embarrassment to the new President. Kennedy had initially shown considerable respect for the JCS the Bay of Pigs probably made far more sceptical about their judgement. Kennedy chose to accept the advice of the majority, the Doves on Ex Comm, and ignore the advice of the JCS and the Hawks. He also with his brother initiated back channel diplomacy that led to the eventual deal including the removal of the Jupiters from Turkey. The Soviet tactical nuclear weapons under local command make that decision appear very wise. ",
