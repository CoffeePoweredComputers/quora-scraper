            "answer_text": "There are old cathedrals based on the date they were founded as institutions and then there are old cathedrals which are actually still standing or at least have bits which are still standing. The Normans demolished and rebuilt most of the earlier ones so anything before the 1070s is rare. This door apparently is the oldest in the UK. It\u2019s at Westminster Abbey and the tree used shows rings between 930\u20131030 but was made into the door around 1050 in the reign of King Edward the Confessor.  Westminster Abbey is not a cathedral but originally an Abbey Church for a Benedictine monastery that stood on an island in the Thames, parts of which are now Westminster School. When central London last flooded in 1928 there was some underpinning done to the Abbey which my grandfather\u2019s company worked on. Apparently the whole edifice stands on foundations made of great oak piles like this which are long since rotted and needed to be propped up with injections of concrete. St Paul\u2019s is the Cathedral in the City of London but was rebuilt after the Great Fire in 1666. Westminster Cathedral is the 19th Catholic Cathedral just down the road from Westminster Abbey built in the style of a Byzantine Basilica, and still not quite finished inside. The cathedral that looks the most Romanesque ( pre-Gothic) is Winchester, which was also originally a Benedictine priory church in the time of St. Swithan (of rain fame) but was rebuilt by William II in 1093. This was on the site of the original Saxon church of 660 in which the Kings of Wessex are buried. Rippon nr. Leeds has the oldest surviving crypt dating from 672 but the cathedral on top is Norman. In Ireland there are a few old churches which escaped Norman upgrades like Skellig Michael, a monastery from the 6th century on Islands off Kerry in the Atlantic. You might have seen these as being where the Jedi Texts were kept in Star Wars VIII : The Last Jedi. ",

            "answer_text": "On the basis that the word Cathedral comes from the Latin \u2018cathedra\u2019 meaning the seat of the the bishop, I think it would be difficult to define the oldest cathedral as there were bishops in the Celtic church before St Augustine established his seat at Canterbury on behalf of the Roman church. On that argument I would have said Iona or Lindisfarne but there are no cathedrals there today. The Anglo Saxon cathedrals would nearly always have been built of wood so there are none left in that form. The ancient cathedrals that we have today are stone and were built after the Norman conquest in 1066. I have no doubt that some cathedral will lay claim to being the oldest but I have not researched that. My guess is that either Canterbury or Winchester would be the most likely to have that honour.
