            "answer_text": "There were two reasons Liechtenstein was not invaded during World War 2. The first is that Liechtenstein was neutral, but under the protection of Switzerland. Though the Germans never tested what protection meant, the Soviet Union did at the end of the war. The Soviet Army chased ex-Soviet soldiers who had fought for the Germans. Thousands of ex Soviet soldiers fled into Liechtenstein in 1945 and were given shelter. The Soviet Army threatened invasion, but stopped when it became known that Switzerland might intervene. There is a statue in Liechtenstein's capital celebrating the 1945 incident. The second is that as a German speaking country, Liechtenstein was sympathetic to Getmany. .Despite not having an Army, seven citizens joined, and died in the German Army. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, it is an interesting question how countries like Liechtenstein, Andorra and San Marino avoided the reunifications and wars that plagued the period. In my opinion these countries are lucky to live in a region where any occupation would be visible to the world community and be reacted to. Not an isolated country like Georgia that could be annexed without anybody noticing. They were propably left alone because it was simply not worth the effort. ",
