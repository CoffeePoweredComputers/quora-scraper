After the death of Josip Broz Tito, there was a significant liberalization of society, which led to an incredible rebirth and explosion of creativity in the cultural and social life of the citizens of Yugoslavia, and with the light of current events like the Sarajevo - XIV Olympic Winter Games[1].

The banknotes of millions of Dinars, and confusion of new and old \u201cmillions\".  The introduction of Yugo car brand.

            "answer_text": "Hopelessness, anger, frustration, poverty, loss of hope that at any time in the future it could be better. In the late 1980s, Yugoslavia was in disarray. Between 1971 and 1981, 219,000 persons were charged with economic crime in the SFRY, which reached one-third of the country's total crime. The accused included 30 000 higher and lower level managers. In 1981 alone, 41,000 citizens of the SFRY were indicted for economic crime. Of these, 10,679 were charged with the criminal offense of \"Theft and Serious Theft of Social Property\". In Yugoslavia, factories and most other assets were jointly owned by all citizens. But instead of treating everything as their property,the prevailing opinion was that it did not really belong to anyone, instead of guarding their property, many people was stealing whatever they could sell. The worst was politicians, people in good positions and their relatives and friends. The so-called little man could have ended up in jail for theft, politicians and people in their circle were not afraid of prison. Annual inflation was 1252 percent!  More than a million people left the country in search of work, and yet unemployment was about 24 percent. Among the youth about 54 percent! The companies made an annual loss of 15 percent of GDP. There were too many employees in the companies and yet productivity was extremely low. It was almost impossible to get fired at work, so most people had fun instead of working. The pay was small and the same, no matter how much work you did, that's why people were not motivated at work. The factories were technologically backward. Even the military, for which money had always been available in earlier times, began to feel deprived. In Kosovo, Albanians were killed and beaten, but still they could not be silenced, protesting and striking against Serbian brutality was constantly being carried out.  Police have reportedly beat up protests in Sarajevo by beating, shooting and arrest. The supply of food was getting weaker, there were frequent shortages, there was a lack of coffee, oil, detergent, chocolate, gas, electricity, gasoline.  Coupons for buying coffee, oil and detergent.  Caption: no gasoline. If a small shipment of a product arrived, long queues would immediately emerge in front of the store.   The elderly and the poorer stood in front of the store every morning, as a smaller amount of cheaper bread would be available in the morning.  The factories sent workers on unpaid leave because they could not procure raw materials for production. Procurement of anything from abroad was extremely difficult because the state went bankrupt, although it did not officially announce it.  Lines for gas. Strikes have become a daily occurrence. The state could no longer pay loan installments, no one wanted to help or lend it anymore, so it could no longer obtain anything, which made its low productivity even lower. Such a catastrophic situation allowed Milosevic to seduce the people with the idea of \u200b\u200ba Greater Serbia and lead them into wars against Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and against Kosovo.
