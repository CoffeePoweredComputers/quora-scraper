            "answer_text": "There are several markers for this. The basic change is one of a \u201csensibility\u201d, from Baroque to \u201cgalant\u201d, as it was called. In Baroque music, counterpoint was king. Never mind Bach\u2019s contrapuntal wizardry - it\u2019s also evident in something like the overture to Handel\u2019s last oratorio, Jephtha. The bass instruments have a real melodic function, the bassoons play along with the string basses and the oboes likewise with the top violin part. The rate at which the chords change almost matches that of the melody notes, at least in the slow opening, so that each melody note or change of notes tends to have a different chord underneath it. That was in 1752. Within a few years of this, and certainly by the year of Handel\u2019s death in 1759, Haydn had written his first symphony. How different! The bass line often chugs along on the same note, more often than not the root note of the chord rather than one of the others (which produces an \u201cinversion\u201d), and the chords change much less frequently - the opening five bars are the same D major chord. This slower rate of chord change is perhaps the most important element of this stylistic change. Chord changes, because they happen less frequently, become more of an event. So what happens when chords aren\u2019t changing? The opening of that Haydn symphony gives us some answers. Your ear is drawn to \u201csurface\u201d features like melodic ornamentation, orchestration and dynamic. That crescendo at the beginning is something Handel wouldn\u2019t have considered doing. It\u2019s almost like the difference between \u201cabstract\u201d (Handel) and \u201cconcrete\u201d (Haydn). You could imagine an arrangement for piano of Handel\u2019s overture, however inadequate it might be, but it would be more difficult to do so for Haydn\u2019s symphony, which is more idiosyncratically written for orchestra. For instance, imagine leaving the oboes out of Handel\u2019s score. Sure, it would sound less full. But it would still be fine. I\u2019ve just recently conducted a Messiah without oboes, and there\u2019s no problem. They\u2019re like an optional add-on. But Haydn\u2019s score couldn\u2019t function without them, and that becomes standard for classical music. In this music, each chord change, because it is rarer, is potentially structurally more significant when it does happen. Conversely, the way a piece ends is quite different in the two styles. In Baroque music the ending is defined harmonically, by the last two chords, which are always V-I - namely, ending on the home chord, or tonic preceded by the \u201cdominant\u201d chord that leads directly to it (a \u201cperfect cadence\u201d, in technical parlance). That\u2019s how Handel\u2019s overture ends - as, for that matter, does Haydn\u2019s second movement. The melodic and the harmonic resolution coincide. Hadyn\u2019s outer movements, however, \u201cend\u201d harmonically with a perfect cadence five bars before the end, then another three bars before the end, then another at the end. The reason Haydn\u2019s two movements don\u2019t actually end at the first cadence is because the harmonic conclusion no longer occurs at the same time as the melodic one. Snatches of melody introduced earlier need repeating at the end to provide a sense of completion. There\u2019s also the matter of emotional structure expressed as orchestral texture, dynamic and colour. All of these considerations are now separate from pure harmony, and it\u2019s Haydn\u2019s genius that he makes them complement each other so perfectly. That\u2019s what his successors, and he himself, increasingly did as the second half of the 18th century wore on. Beethoven took this to extremes, hammering away at the tonic for bars and bars after the \u201cfinal\u201d perfect cadence. One important instrument in Classical orchestration is the bassoon. In Handel\u2019s score, the bassoons are to the bass line what the oboes are to the melody. They simply double it, thereby reinforcing it. Part of the increasing emphasis on orchestration encouraged by the slower rate of chord change, however, was that the bassoons were freed from the bass line to act melodically or harmonically in their own right. Later in the 18th century, when flutes and then clarinets were added to the orchestra as staple components, there was a full wind choir (flute, oboe, clarinet and bassoon, as equivalents of soprano, alto, tenor and bass respectively) to complement the strings\u2019 first violins, second violins, violas and cellos/basses. The first movement of Mozart\u2019s 40th Symphony illustrates this: winds are now used quite independently, and in fact in alternation with the strings for a colouristic effect. As far as orchestration goes, you can get a really good idea of the difference between the two by comparing Handel\u2019s Messiah, written in 1741, with Mozart\u2019s arrangement of it, written in 1789. Try the two choruses \u201cSurely he hath borne our griefs\u201d and \u201cAll we like sheep\u201d in both. Mozart uses the woodwind, and especially the horns, to highlight the continuities at the beginning of the latter, so that it sounds harmonically more homogeneous. Fast forward to any mature Haydn or Mozart symphony and you get the full version of the same thing. Winds and horns are used as a sort of \u201ccontinuo\u201d to provide a harmonic backdrop; you\u2019ll note that the rate of melodic note change is astronomical compared to the rate of chord change. A chord can last for one, two or more bars (especially in the faster allegros you get in the later Classical period), during which all sorts of stuff is going on in the melodic line. Another important Classical development was that of musical drama. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything vocal; it means the inclusion of more than one \u201caffect\u201d in a movement. You\u2019ll note that Baroque movements or sections are relatively unvarying. That in no way implies boring - they just work out one emotional idea, or \u201caffect\u201d, throughout the movement. You can see Haydn\u2019s first and third movements already becoming more variegated than the individual sections of Handel\u2019s overture. This tendency only increased as the Classical era progressed and movements incorporated an increasing variety of elements, until you get the last movement of Beethoven\u2019s 5th Symphony, where he recalls the previous movement partway through, and then the kaleidoscope of the last movement of the 9th, which covers the emotional and musical gamut: slow/fast, soft/loud, jubilant/reflective etc. Many scenes and finales from Mozart operas embody the same principle using contrasting verbal and musical elements to develop a dramatic and musical situation into something different than they started with. No Baroque composer could have done this in one movement - it would have taken several movements to \u201cdevelop\u201d a situation. Classical works consequently sound \u201cdramatic\u201d in that they oppose contrasting elements in the same movement, something Baroque movements rarely if ever do. This is most evident in the Classical concerto, which I was taught at school exemplifies \u201cconflict\u201d. I\u2019ve never quite seen that, but \u201ccontrast\u201d, of dynamic, harmony, melody and texture is certainly evident. Well before 1800 sonata form had become the basic musical form. It\u2019s bipartite: in the \u201cexposition\u201d, Thing A leads to Thing B in a different key; the \u201crecapitulation\u201d repeats the exposition, Thing B this time being engineered to end in the same key as Thing A. As the 18th century wore on, the \u201cthings\u201d grew longer and the transitions between the two sections (the \u201cdevelopment\u201d) became more significant. All of this leads to one major development: increased overall length of movements. A movement of a Classical symphony is on average markedly longer than any Baroque movement. This is because it takes longer to realise the implications of that \u201cdrama\u201d, with all its contrasting elements, than it does to work out one idea, or \u201caffect\u201d, as in the Baroque. Bach\u2019s Brandenburg concertos are about as long as Baroque movements get; Classical movements are that length and longer as a matter of course. All of which leads to a different sound in 1770 than obtained in 1740. That is one of the biggest musical revolutions, to my mind, Western music has seen, the others being the development of polyphony in the 12th century, the addition of the third to harmony in the 14th, the transition from a contrapuntal to a harmonic-based style of composition from around 1600 and the development of atonality around 1900. I hope this simple overview helps you understand a very complicated subject. ",

            "answer_text": "When Bach Died.   This, as taught to me in Music History 101, is the true reason that the Baroque period ends in 1750, the same year as Bach's death.  Of course it wasn't as black and white as that.  If you listen to the music of CPE Bach, or  Franz Joseph Hayden, or the earliest works of Mozart, you will hear element of both eras. One of the biggest reasons for the change from Baroque to Classical is that music stopped being only functional (mostly in churches) and became more of an art form.  Bach wrote most of his music for church services.  The most famous pieces of music from the Baroque period were written either for religious ceremonies (the messiah, St Mathews Passion, Bach chorals, contats and organ works) or Social events (coronations, Ceremonies, etc.).  This still continued some in the Classical period.  Mozart wrote most of his music at the request of his Patron, but it was not for religious or ceremonious reasons.  It was more of a way of showing off.  Since Aristocrats couldn't buy a Maserati or the LA Lakers back then they needed another way to show off their wealth. The Formal style of the Classical period was largely Sonata form.  Though it was around some in the late Baroque period, the sonata form was the defining musical form of the Classical era.  The forms of the Baroque era were much freer and often defined by what dance went with them. As for style, Baroque music was know for it's heavy ornamentation.  Kind of what Christina Aguilar does when she sings, is what most people did when they played any instrument in the Baroque period.  Crazy runs, turns, trill, appogiaturas etc.  It was mostly Improvised based on common practice.  In the Classical period this was no done as much, and when it was done, it was because it was written in the music. So, Bach Died, Form changed, and the Style changed.  I'm sure there are other ways to describe the change, but this is what I can come up with for now. ",

            "answer_text": "A period or era is often set in stone by dates in hindsight but it is often a slow progression of change that can not be delineated so concretely. There were two major events which drove the classical era despite that there were new musical styles emerging and dying regardless. The first was Equal Temperament. This temperament was toyed with since the Medieval Period but hadn\u2019t been set in stone until Bach figured it out on a new fangled instrument called the piano/forte. By fudging the tuning of the perfect fifths he was able to tune the piano so that it could be played in all keys. This didn\u2019t do much for other instruments, though because they were handmade and irregular. Enter the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution made it so that not only could musical instruments be mass produced but equal temperament could be built into each instrument. This made it so that any instrument could play in every key and actually sound good with other instruments. Enter the orchestra. Having an instrument in every hand, every home with the ability to play with every other instrument inspired composers and arrangers to write for orchestras and the Classical Era exploded with a new style of music. Bach\u2019s death is said to be the end of the Baroque period but it was the creeping of these events which in hindsight heralded the Classical Era. Bach\u2019s death is used because . . . we need a date. The industrial revolution also created jobs. People had more money to spend on entertainment and instruments. Concert halls were built to accommodate orchestras and the quality of life significantly improved. There were many other factors including plumbing, fire control, rodent control and new medical achievements which improved quality of life which gave people a reason to \u201csing.\u201d Putting money in the hands of workers can make huge changes to a society. We can see these sorts of evolution occur in our lifetime but on a smaller scale. My city built a casino which resulted in hotels and restaurants opening around it which inspired a convention center which inspired more hotels and restaurants. Roads and sewers improved, slum areas were bought out and renovated. The Casino had several theaters for touring musical acts. This resulted in a neighboring city\u2019s thriving music and theater scene to die which resulted in restaurants closing and the city atrophied in all aspects. Both cities experienced the birth and end of their respective eras. Quick, we need a date. Who died? ",

Telemann wrote more music than anyone and was the most famous in his day, so why would we need Telemann part 2? The natural transition would be for Baroque music to move into the concert hall where more was demanded of music as it began to be regarded as a serious art. People were interested in music now not just for its practical applications but as theatre and entertainment. Going to the concert hall demanded a major work of multiple movements. The structure of these movements became custom. If you were Italian you praised Italian music over Austrian, German, French, English. Countries competed with each other. Composers became national treasures. Kings and Queens realized it was important to foster their culture, support their composers, have fine music for some important event. And then composers came to be viewed more as the driving force behind these works of art, not just a shoemaker or cobbler. The public became more literate about music as well. It was an integral part of life. How did classical transition to Romantic? We wanted more theatre out of music. Beethoven helped make this transition. Audiences demanded pieces that lifted them up and were exciting. Musicians, particularly performers, became the rock stars of the day. ",

In 1763 in France the change to a simpler form of Music was forced on composers by the French authorities by stating that any composer who wanted his works to be accepted to the years schedule for performance had to compose in a new simpler style so that the gate receipts would keep being large enough to keep the concerts going. In general the French Public was getting fed up with the three King Louies throwing away vast amounts of tax money on constant wars, and other excesses that kings had become known for. There was a great divide between the powdered, perfumed aristocracy and the dirty, filthy, smelly street rabble. The street rabble demanded a new simpler form of Music and they got it. This street rabble brought about the French Revolution and almost succeeded in destroying all the Medieval French Cathedrals to rubble. They were only able to chop the heads off of all the statues of the Biblical Kings which stood all around Notre Dame Paris Cathedral. They were able to stop the composition of Baroque Music. ",

            "answer_text": "The greatest exponent of the High Baroque style, J.S. Bach, was already considered old-fashioned and had been all but forgotten when he died in 1750. Several of his sons, most notably C.P.E. Bach and J.C. Bach, were composers who consciously developed styles radically different from their father\u2019s, emphasizing much simpler textures, with little counterpoint and more direct\u2014sometimes melodramatic\u2014musical expression. The grand rhetoric of the Baroque\u2014think Bach\u2019s most powerful organ works and Handel\u2019s concerti grossi, operas and oratorios\u2014gave way to much more down-to-earth music. Haydn and Mozart inherited this style and developed it to its peak by the 1790s. And then Beethoven erupted onto the scene, breaking the mold again. The pure Classical style lasted about 50 years, from roughly 1760 to 1810. ",

            "answer_text": "Like all such changes, it was gradual.  Even in Handel's later work, there are hints of Classical structure, such as the phrase repetition \"thy jocund strain\" in the aria \"Come, ever-smiling Liberty\" from the oratorio Judas Maccabeus from 1746.  And often, discussions of Classical music start with Domenico Scarlatti and his keyboard sonatas, most of which are decidedly un-Baroque, despite the fact that he was born the same year as Bach and Handel.  Also, we forget just how many composers were active at the time. There was a period where things were in-between, with composers born around 1700 like Leonardo Leo, Johann Adolf Hasse,  Ignaz Holzbauer, and Pergolesi were active, and music started getting simpler and more periodic.  Haydn and Mozart (not to mention Mslivicek, Martin y Soler, or countless others) just put the finishing touches on this. ",

            "answer_text": "To some extent, the Renaissance to Baroque and Baroque to Classical (or Gallant depending on when one marks the calendar) were driven by an attempt (among some composers) to return to the ancient Greek concept of music. (I\u2019d argue that the transition from Medieval to Renaissance occurred for the same reasons.) The Current Style (whichever one is being examined) seemed to some to be over-done and lack the simplicity of what Ancient Greek Music was thought to be. The Renaissance had muli-part polyphony which was though to obscure the words and the Baroque had other (slightly different) polyphony which was thought to obscure various lines (leading to the Sturm and Drang and Gallant styles.) Later Haydn (mostly on his own but he did know some of Bach\u2019s sons) figured out how to combine polyphony (especially in a bass line) and still achieve the \u201cclassical\u201d idea of balance. Of course, there were other \u201ccauses.\u201d Composers would borrow different parts of older music and combine them in different ways. Music for money (public concerts) became popular as did public performances of opera and other works (oratorios like Messiah). (Yes I like it.) The invention of new instruments (and modifications of old ones) (violins, pianos, modern valved winds, etc.) allowed composers to try new ideas (and allowed, especially with the piano, amateurs to participate.) It\u2019s a complex story and the above may illustrate about 1% or so of what was happening esthetically. ",

Look for more classical era, less baroque era in his last works, still quite baroque though. Through the centuries. orchestras got larger & more powerful, starting with Latter Montaverdi stuff. Though orchestras were bigger for the Hyden brothers & mozart symphonies, but due to less brass & heavy pecussion, the sound gentler than heavy baroque stuff. Beethovens symphs were as heave as they came, for the day, but things soon got much heavier. ",
