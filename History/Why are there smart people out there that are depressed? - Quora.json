            "answer_text": "My mom is very smart. She made all A's in school, and was the smartest kid in the class. She even won a trophy for a city-wide math competition. She went to a mostly-male college for engineering and was the only female in most of her classes. She was very depressed though. She was always overweight as a child which made her self-concious. That doesn't have much to do with her intelligence though. Along with her, my grandmother also has depression, and my uncle's bipolar, so it seems to run in the family. I was entered into the school's gifted program in 1st grade, and I'm in year ahead math, but I consider myself only a little above average. In 5th grade, out of nowhere, I started getting really suicidal. Not depressed, but suicidal. I would spend hours planning a suicide that I could get away with, and kept on muttering \"What's the point of living if you're just gonna die someday\" under my breath. It got so bad that a social worker at school saw me sad everday and called defax. I got better. I was forced on to medication and I was very reluctant. My parents said if I didn't take it, they'd put me in a mental hospital. I'd say because intelligent people tend to push themselves more, they get stressed easier. Also they can be detail-oriented leading them to be self concious. ",

            "answer_text": "It is an established fact that if we perceive the World as it is, we will be depressed. In general our understanding of Reality directly depends on your so called \u201csmartness\u201d. For example, We are humans. Humans being social animals yearn for human contact on an emotional level. But a smart person has a tough time adjusting with anyone because of many reasons. One reason, they can spot lies very easily. Either by looking at body cues or purely based on logic or both. This happens instantaneously without any effort. So how can they really believe in anyone. 99% people lie in some way. They see everything clearly. Our day to day life itself seems like a big lie. The religion is a lie. The government is a lie. Everyone at every level is trying to make things run for their own benefit. This is no conspiracy. It is a reality. Just like we give many reasons to justify that eating meat is not bad. It is sheer cruelty in the eyes of the animal. In this world every person is an animal ready to become a meal for some other person. This is of course metaphorical but very deep in sense. If you don\u2019t think this is true, why does the richest 1% own more wealth than rest 90% population? ",
