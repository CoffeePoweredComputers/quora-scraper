            "answer_text": "Japan authorities have a different view of anti-semitism and allowed 18,000 Jews to come to Shanghai after the 1938 Crystal Night in Germany. The thousands of Jews who lost their homes that night had no place to go, country after country were turning them away. The United Stated block Jews from entering. I do not know the reason unless the Democrats were racist. Many in the Democratic Congress were racist before the change towards the blacks came in the 1960's and later. I assume many in Congress were racist toward Jews as well. Apparently, blacks and Jews are ignorant of how Democrats treated both races yet they vote for Democrats. The Nazi's put pressure on the Japanese government to stop accepting Jews, however, Japan cut back accepting as many Jews in Shanghai and took them to Kobe, Japan. These Jews fared much better than the ones in Shanghai. The local Japanese were friendly and brought food to the Jews. The Nazi's put pressure on Japan to put the Jews in a concentration camp. As allies, Japan did enclose the Jews in Shanghai but they were treated much better than those in Germany and Poland. Food became a problem during the war because of commercial ships being sunk, but they made it to the end of the war. ",

Undoubtedly this would mean many people would have died in the camps if he didnt do what he did, and was seen as a humanitarian gesture. Compare this with the Americans who turned back a shipload of Jews and did not allow them entry into the United States. They were shipped back to France or Germany and then exterminated at Auschwitz.
