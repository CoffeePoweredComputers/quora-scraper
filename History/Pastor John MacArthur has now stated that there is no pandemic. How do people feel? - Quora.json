            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a Christian who formerly attended MacArthur\u2019s church. He is widely regarded as a respected Bible teacher, but honestly, he has always been dodgy when it comes to matters outside his area of expertise (most notably, science). To add a bit of context, MacArthur is currently doing battle with the governments of Los Angeles City and California State. The government has ordered COVID-19 restrictions in effect in an effort to keep the pandemic under control. MacArthur is defying those orders, and for several weeks now, his church has been packed with people, sitting closely together, indoors, very few wearing masks, and they spend a lot of time singing \u2014 all in clear violation with the orders. MacArthur has been receiving legal support in this battle from President Trump, and his church is represented by attorney and Trump legal advisor, Jenna Ellis. John MacArthur has argued that the government restrictions are tantamount to persecution of the church. As part of that argument, he has needed to downplay the seriousness of COVID-19. I\u2019m afraid that this is where his poor understanding of science and statistics comes into play. Here is one statement he made to that effect: \u201cBut we are now more than twenty weeks into the unrelieved restrictions. It is apparent that those original projections of death were wrong and the virus is nowhere near as dangerous as originally feared.\u201d \u2014 MacArthur in \u2018Christ, not Caesar, is Head of the Church\u2019 It is completely wrong to downplay the seriousness of COVID-19 based on the actual death toll being much less than the originally projected death toll. The COVID-19 restrictions were put into place to prevent the original projections from becoming the actuality! The actual death total is lower than the original projections thanks to those restrictions he is fighting against. By analogy, if the government imposes seatbelt and airbag laws, and as a result, the number of traffic fatalities is greatly reduced, would we then argue that we don\u2019t need those seatbelt and airbag laws because the number of fatalities is so low? \u201cThey (people at Grace) began to realize that there weren't dead bodies in the streets. And it became pretty clear that the death rate in California from COVID is 0.02 and the average age of the person dying is 78, and the average age of a person who dies without COVID is 78. They began to put the two together and say this doesn't make any sense\u201d\u2014 MacArthur in The Charlie Kirk Show transcripts I don\u2019t know where MacArthur got this 0.02 number, and since he didn\u2019t say \u201cpercent\u201d, it\u2019s not clear if he was presenting that rate as a ratio or a percentage. If he meant a ratio, then a ratio of 0.02 means that 2% of COVID-19 victims die. If he is claiming that only 0.02% of COVID-19 victims die, then he is using a dubious figure that is much lower than what is reported in qualified medical publications. The CDC estimates a death rate in the range of 0.3% to 3.0% (it\u2019s not a number easy to compute, and varies by methodology). But the COVID-19 death rate isn\u2019t the only number that matters. Just as important is the COVID-19 infection rate. For example, I say that the COVID-19 death rate is 3.0% and you say the rate is only 0.3%, that\u2019s fine, but then you must accept that the COVID-19 infection rate is 10 times higher than I say it is, in order to account for the same number of COVID-19 related deaths. Regarding his other claim \u2014 the one about the average of death is 78 whether or not the victim had COVID-19, I addressed that here: Jerry Olsen's answer to Is it true that the average age of death from Covid-19 is older than the average age of death? All this leads into MacArthur\u2019s most recent comment (referenced in this question): \u201cI don\u2019t want to offer myself as any kind of an expert, but a rather telling report came out this week, and for the first time, we heard the truth. The CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, which is the national organization \u2014 government organization \u2014 that is to report to us truth about disease said that, in truth, 6% of the deaths that have occurred can be directly attributable to COVID. 94% cannot.\u201d \u201cOf the 160,000 people that have died, 9,210 actually died from COVID.\u201d \u201cThere is no pandemic\u201d. \u2014 MacArthur in a statement to his congregation, August 30, 2020 Well, there he goes. First admitting that he isn\u2019t any kind of expert \u2014 and then going on to proclaim a QAnon-style denial statement about COVID-19 that contradicts the testimony of actual infectious disease experts from all over the world! There was no quiet and sneaky report from the CDC. It was a standard report that stated what has been known for months: The great majority of people who died from COVID-19 were more vulnerable due to other conditions such as heart disease, hypertension, asthma, or whatever. In fact, this is the case for practically all diseases \u2014 healthier people with fewer issues are more likely to survive. MacArthur jumped to the bewildering conclusion that most people who died after being infected by COVID didn\u2019t really die of COVID at all, because they had these other conditions! Never mind that almost all of them would still be alive today if they didn\u2019t get COVID. From there, he leaped to an even more bizarre conclusion that there is no pandemic! After this statement, you can hear his congregation cheering this news. So forget what happened in New York when hospitals there couldn\u2019t handle all the patients, the morgues couldn\u2019t handle all the dead bodies, and the health care workers were dangerously overburdened. Forget the similar disasters in Italy, Spain, and elsewhere. \u201cThere\u2019s no pandemic\u201d, says John MacArthur, the admitted non-expert. I\u2019m afraid he has been making a terrible fool of himself lately. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that this foolishness coincides with him hitching himself politically to Donald Trump.

            "answer_text": "(Edited after reading other answers and getting some idea of who MacArthur is and what he stands for.) \u201cHow do people feel about Pastor John MacArthur and his silly proclamation?\u201d I\u2019ve never heard of John MacArthur before, but if he\u2019s claiming that there\u2019s no pandemic, he\u2019s contradicting what I\u2019ve heard from all sorts of informed sources - including someone whose son had Covid19 several months ago - for the past six months. MacArthur doesn\u2019t seem to be a reliable source. Now that I know that, why should I care about anything else he may have said? Additional thoughts - I had never heard of MacArthur before I was asked this question, but now I\u2019ve done a bit of research on him. I gather he\u2019s upset and defiant because the state of California wants him to stop holding church services the way they used to be, before Covid. Asking people to crowd close together, sing as loud as they can, and ignore all the simple precautions we use these days is an effective way to spread the virus, but he wants to ignore inconvenient details like that. Doesn\u2019t anyone remember that one of the first significant outbreaks in this country happened because a choir in Washington state got together for a rehearsal? The thing is, there are ways to deal with this year\u2019s troubles. The church I go to started holding online services - something we had never done before - as soon as New Jersey went under lockdown, in the middle of last March. (And now that the virus is mostly under control in this area, we\u2019ve been able to add outdoor services with no singing and with everyone spaced six feet apart, while continuing the online services for people who don\u2019t believe they can attend in person safely.) If our church, which is much smaller and poorer than MacArthur\u2019s, can find the resources to go online, so can he. I don\u2019t understand why MacArthur thinks it\u2019s vital to worship like it\u2019s 2019. God knows our hearts; he doesn\u2019t require us to be in a special building. The church is the people, not the building. In this bad year, distancing is how we show our love for one another. Original question: Pastor John MacArthur has now stated that there is no pandemic. How do people feel? ",
