Trump, William Barr, Mike Pompeo, Rudy Giuliani, Mulvaney, Pence, Mannuchin, all of his family members are compromised! Also, Moscow Mitch and his GOP thugs are all corrupt, brainwashed or plain old stupid! I don\u2019t know how any normal person can possibly keep up with the speed in which corruption schemes are being uncovered! I need a freaking map in my living room with Putin in the middle\u2026 and lines connecting all the \u201cplayers\u201d! It\u2019s like a Mob Takedown! Our National Security has been comprised so badly, that it is breathtaking! I\u2019m sure Mueller was aware of a lot of this, but felt he had to keep his mouth shut\u2026 either because he was aware of ongoing intelligence investigations, and/or he knew it was so bad, that he feared that Trump would take down The USA with him. So here we are\u2026 with a deranged, frightened, narcissist who\u2019s finally getting backed into a corner called \u201cTHE Fu@&$ING TRUTH\u201d. I pray to God that we rise from the ashes, ready to root out the kind of corruption that has decayed our institutions, and helped cause the apathy that has kept us from keeping a good eye on our elected officials, and allowed Russia to hack into our elections. Putin is laughing his head off! I\u2019m sure he finds the \u201cslow motion\u201d implosion of our country very entertaining! A revolution is due! A new order by the people, for the people, is coming! Trump represents absolute evil. So much so, and so obviously, that it doesn\u2019t seem real! Think about it\u2026 he has dismantled everything, from the environment, to our food, to our health care, to faith in our elections, to women\u2019s rights, gun laws, our Allies no longer trust us, and now he hands our friends the Kurds over to slaughter. Haven\u2019t enough red lines been crossed? The train is out of control, and we are about to jump the tracks! Trying to make some kind of sense of this\u2026 Perhaps Trump was the Miracle we needed to save ourselves and the world! You better hope so\u2026 otherwise, the Anti-Christ is running our country. High Crimes! Unstable insanity! Mitch\u2026 a piece of advice! Stand up, stand together with the House! Do your DUTY, and defend our country! Get Rid Of Trump! Nancy\u2026 Go put your white suit on, and like Joan of Arc, kick some ass!  Felt the need to ask WH if this is actually real and it is. pic.twitter.com/bHyIFw6cvO\u2014 Katie Rogers (@katierogers) October 16, 2019\n ",

            "answer_text": "To decide if someone is a good leader I would like to check some leadership attributes[1]: Be accountable: Trump showed over and over again that he refuses to take responsibility for his actions. He went bankrupt 4 times and needed to be bailed out by his dad and by not paying taxes. Whenever he is confronted with something he said that does make him look bad now, he denies or goes to his \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d answer. Be decisive: As said before his typical answers are: Yes, no I don\u2019t know, some say, I guess so. The only thing he keeps up is that he wants to build a wall and that is a very weak message. Integrity: He cheated on his wives, he is the biggest name caller in the history of name calling, he used money from his charity foundation to pay for pictures of himself and to bribe officials, he did not pay taxes, he openly is proud how he buys officials, and he cheated on about every contractor who ever worked for him and this list is far from being complete. Focus: Well I don\u2019t know, some say but we really should\u2026. His policies are all over the place. He says one thing then the other and while the overall direction points towards a xenophobic racist point of view, the only focal point is the wall. Courage: Or as the German army said, lead from the front. He was a draft dodger. He only risked the capital of his dad and his investors. He followed the business of his dad, not trying something new. When asked what he sacrificed he said he created jobs\u2026.. Vision: He wants to make America great again, but this is not a vision, this is just a statement that America sucks. A vision needs to have a goal. A great vision came from JFK: By the end of the decade we will bring a man to the moon and back. This is actionable and time bound while \u201cmake America great again\u201d has nothing actionable and is not time bound. It is like saying I like motherly love and apple pie. Humility: I think there is no argument about how humble the Donald is. Strategic Thinking: This might be a point where the Donald actually does not fail but does not score great either. But as we saw multiple times he lacks the ability to prepare for debates. He is not a facts person. He as well was not able to hire a speechwriter for his wife that does not copy Michelle Obama\u2019s speech, that on top does not fit his life at all\u2026.. Cooperation: Saying you are a people person does not make you a people person. He has showed over and over again that he will cheat his partners. His catchphrase is: \u201cyou are fired\u201d. Who would like to work for Trump if another Job would pay you the same? He publicly told: \u201cWhen I negotiate, they lose and I win.\u201d A good deal means both win and when you know the other side wants you to lose, you are not willing to make a fair and beneficial deal. Now this is all independent of where Trump wants the country to be.

            "answer_text": "Trump is a less than ideal leader because he fails at both parts of leadership, which isn\u2019t easy to do. He doesn\u2019t lead, he follows. When he does decide to lead he doesn\u2019t care what anyone else thinks, does what he wants and tells people to get on board or get out, while they thought they were already on board. (If you are asking about how Trump leads people who don\u2019t work for him I would give a different answer.) Part of the problem with leadership is that the leader is in charge. If you have a better idea the leader still gets his way. A bad leader doesn\u2019t give enough respect or power to his underlings - so the leader is stuck with the whole job of leading - because he didn\u2019t lead his own crew better. That kind of leader will make a snap decision and roll with it. When things are not disastrous it \u2018proves\u2019 the leader right, so he thinks he is an awesome leader. We will never know if the other ideas would have worked even better. This way may be better than a leader who is so busy listening to everyone that he can\u2019t act decisively, but really you don\u2019t want either of those guys in charge. You want the leader who gathers experts, hears their advice, decides what to do, and tells his people what he wants done. Another example of poor leadership is a lack of clarity in his instructions. This may be the most important thing. We should never hear Trump contradict the State Department, especially on twitter. Top lieutenants should know what the leader wants and then carry it out. He should have been running State better, or he should be listening to his experts. It sounds like one of a few things happened there. Maybe he didn\u2019t give the State department a clear enough idea about what he wants them to do. Maybe he decided to listen to someone other than the State Department without consulting or informing them of his decision before telling the whole world. Maybe he changed his mind and didn\u2019t tell anyone. Maybe they gave him what he asked for, and when he saw it he didn\u2019t like it and blamed his people rather than admit he didn\u2019t give clear guidance. No matter what, Trump should have people he delegates to run things the way he wants them run. If they aren\u2019t running it that way, is it because the person refuses to obey the president? Is it because they are unable to perform the job? It is more likely because the president didn\u2019t tell the people who work for him what he is thinking, so they had no way of knowing how he wants things done. It is much easier to work for a general than it is to work for a captain. The general is really really good at giving orders and seeing that they are carried out. The captain might not be quite as mentally organized - he is more likely to delegate tasks without clarity and then wonder why no one can do what he wants. The general delegates responsibility and his people know what to do and do it. People who work for the captain can only try. (I have only worked with military people who retired - I don\u2019t want to imply that I served). Another problem is that Trump isn\u2019t always a leader. He is a follower way too often. I think it is hard to deny that his image means a lot to him. If he finds out that people believe a certain way he will say something to please them or to denigrate them-whichever his followers will like best. If something will make people, especially his supporters, like him more then he does it. There needs to be a balance. You don\u2019t want a leader who isn\u2019t paying attention to the people. You don\u2019t want a leader who just does whatever is popular. It seems like we have the latter with Trump. We have a Vegas massacre and a lot of school shootings, and Trump talks about raising the purchase age for guns to 21 and banning bump stocks, because a lot of people wanted something done about it. The next day Trump\u2019s donors and supporters are quite upset with those ideas, and he immediately reverses course. There are right ways to do these things. He could have consulted his people first, who would have told him that he better talk to the NRA before considering new gun laws. Or he could have stuck to his position and told the NRA \u2018I\u2019m still better than Clinton\u2019. Instead he followed, and then followed again. Trump gives us a disturbing combination of these. He won\u2019t take advice, won\u2019t respect the people he delegates authority to, and changes his mind. How does anyone work for people like that? ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that Trump is not a good leader because nearly everything he says and does is terrible and if all Americans did as he does there would be more unemployment, poverty and misery, not to mention more discord among countries around the world. Nearly everyone knows his flaws, even if they don\u2019t care about them, but I will list the worst ones: He lies constantly. Whether he is even aware he is doing it is conjecture because it is unrelenting, even as far as denying he said something that there is a video of him saying. That his followers don\u2019t care about this is terrifying to me.He verbally attacks those whom he feels \u201caren\u2019t nice\u201d to him, even after decades have passed. What could that turn into? He encourages his followers to attack his detractors. He wants his followers to police voting precincts and intimidate voters who might vote against him.He doesn\u2019t care about the country. If the US were bombed to smithereens he is rich enough to pack up and move to Russia. Don\u2019t think he wouldn\u2019t. He only wants to be president to improve his business dealings. He has no intention of doing the work himself.He doesn\u2019t care about the rest of the world. He wants to dump NATO, evidently on the urging of his Russian friends. He thinks more countries should have nuclear weapons. He doesn\u2019t know what a nuclear winter is. If Trump is elected, the doomsday clock will move closer to human annihilation than it has ever been.",

            "answer_text": "I believe Trump\u2019s tweet over the weekend about the Democrats being to blame for the immigrant children who have now been \u201clost\u201d in the system is an excellent example of why he is not a good leader. A good leader does not point fingers and then sit back and do nothing. He has been blaming Democrats for his legislative failures for the last 15 months. But the Democrats hold absolutely no power. They control nothing in Washington. When Trump is not blaming the Democrats, he\u2019s blaming the media or the intelligence community. This is not a trait of a good leader. In addition, he spends a tremendous amount of time watching Fox News, sending out tweets, and playing golf. (The amount of golf he plays is orders of magnitude higher than Obama, whom Trump criticized for playing too much golf.) Our nation is deeply divided, along political, racial, and ideological lines. A good leader would be focused on that. A good leader would be doing something more than paying lip service to those concerned about gun violence, while praising the NRA. A good leader would not tear up international agreements without having another solution firmly in hand. Finally, it is my opinion that a good leader is not a bully. A good leader doesn\u2019t call people names and accuse them of being liars when he disagrees with them. A good leader doesn\u2019t change his mind from one day to the next, or sometimes even one hour to the next. A good leader is decisive, but a good leader also listens to those around him are more expert than he in certain matters. On a less objective note, I believe a good leader reads and is knowledgeable about the history of the organization he is supposed to be leading, as well as other relevant history. I also believe a good leader does not abuse his power to punish his enemies. Case in point, Trump\u2019s pressuring the Postmaster General to increase rates on Amazon because Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, despite the fact that the U.S. Postal Service has a contract with Amazon. So, those are some reasons I think Trump is not a good leader. Unless, of course, your question was meant to ask why Trump is incapable of being a good leader. In that case, the answer is simple: A good leader has to consider what\u2019s good for other people besides just himself. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. The current President of the United States assumed office on 20th January 2017: a little more than a month ago. His administration is not even in place yet: a number of senior level positions have yet to be filled. There is the inevitable confusion and uncertainty that accompanies such a transition. So he hasn\u2019t really had time to rule yet. There is no way of judging the quality of his administration. The American system gives each President a 4 year term (extendable to at most another 4 years). That is the time scale over which to judge performance. So something like 2 years into the administration would be a good point to start making judgements. However, Mr. Trump is not your usual politician. In fact, he is not a politician in the conventional sense. He did not work his way up the machinery of the existing political parties, building networks of support and funds, cultivating constituencies etc. Mr. Trump is very much like some character played by Salman Khan (think Chulbul Pandey). Rude, boastful, self-assured. Do you remember that scene in Dabang where the priest asks who will bless Chulbul\u2019s wedding? When no one steps forward, Chulbul Pandey blesses himself. Mr. Trump\u2019s attitude is a lot like that. He doesn\u2019t need anybody. Not their support, not their money. Nothing. He is his own man. The current political establishment (including the resource intensive mainstream media) is deeply threatened by such a man. He has no use for the deep, tight and complex web of relationships, quid pro quos and money channels that they have set up over the decades: definitely in their own interest and not necessarily in the interest of the general population. They thought they had the power game locked up. Mr. Trump has smashed through their illusions. Like some ancient champion, he has performed a feat of might and ability. Quite literally glorious to behold. All the protests about poor administrative quality etc is just wishful thinking. The established elite wish he would be a poor administrator. That is the only way they can recover their power and influence (which is, of course, wealth). If he turns out to be great administrator, they will be utterly discredited. What you are seeing is a remarkable, even historical, transition of real power where one group of elites is supplanted by another. The old group is not going out without a fight. Note: While this is fun to watch (who doesn\u2019t enjoy seeing on fat cats\u2019 tails get stepped on?) it need not necessarily be better for the general population. It is merely an exchange of elites. It is not guaranteed that the new elite will be more in touch with the common man than the old. ",

In every single company I\u2019ve worked for: A CEO who gets the same results as the last CEO, but has a revolving door for a staff , would not last long, if he\u2019d even be selected for the job in the first place. A CEO who talks a big game but prioritizes making himself look good over the good of the company, would not last long. A CEO who focuses on ineffective policies like building a stupid and expensive wall, would not last long. A CEO who gleefully alienates half the company (e.g. \u201cI\u2019m a finance guy so to hell with those stupid sales and marketing people\u201d) would not last long, or likely even be hired in the first place. A CEO who is the subject of every story he tells, who constantly boasts about how great he is, who makes up facts and figures to prove to everyone how great he is, would not be selected for the job in the first place. A CEO who constantly whines and complains about our competitors would not even get the job in the first place. A CEO who had done well on reality TV but otherwise had a poor track record for business would not even get the job in the first place. A CEO who has declared bankruptcy 6 times, and would essentially fail a background check, would not even get the job in the first place. Would any company hire Trump to run it? Would anyone trust Trump and his family with the keys to the company and trust him to steward that company and its brand, to take great care of its customers, and guide the company into the future? None of the companies, including several in the Fortune 500, would, because they care about the how as much as the what. Is something wrong with them? Would you even trust Trump to run a department at your company, and if so, which one, and why? ",

But if you are a member of The Establishment he\u2019s been a good leader. The Establishment has gotten just about everything on their wish list. There\u2019s a few things they\u2019re still looking for and the Trump Administration is working on those wishes yet to be fulfilled, but the fix is in. If you are still looking for the antiEstablishment leader you voted for, well, don\u2019t hold your breath. You\u2019ll have to be happy with Trump\u2019s unconventional and often outrageous behavior, because that\u2019s all your going to get. You\u2019re not going to get any deconstruction of The Establishment, it has been and is going to be further enriched. So the answer to this question depends on whether you\u2019re a member of The Establishment or not. If you are then President Trump is a good leader. If you aren\u2019t he\u2019s not. Of course, millions of Trump voters haven\u2019t figured this out yet. And many of them never will. ",

He knows what he wants like nobody else, he has his own way of doing thinks not like other presidents who are doing the same failing things for decades, 1. like his trade deals policies he is thinking of the american worker. 2. and like NATO where he is demanding from all our partners to pay their fair share. 3. on security he is not afraid to confront RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and tell openly to our Muslim partners that they need to stop their extremist. 4. he is connecting to the working class people in america like nobody else and no matter how hostile the MEDIA is to him they are still loyal to each other. 5. look at the trip he is taking now the the MIDDLE EAST , i have never seen an american leader get this kind of respect of other leaders, it\u2019s on real the respect he is receiving from the Muslim leaders, because they know he is a leader and he is not afraid from nobody. 6. he understands things like nobody else look how many people dismissed him THE MEDIA, THE NEVER TRUMPERS, THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, THE DEMOCRATS, and every time he won, and he had a clearer vision then all of them. i need to leave it here although i have much more examples of his leadership skills, THANK YOU ALL FOR READING MY ANSWER I HOPE YOU WILL GIVE ME AN UP-VOTE, THANKS AGAIN.

            "answer_text": "Why? Because Trump views himself as a 'ruler' and not as a leader. The term 'ruler' suggests complete control without the help, assistance or collaboration from anyone else. Surely having a 'leader' would be more desirable? \"A ruler owns his subjects. Meaning they're accountable to him/her but he/she isn't accountable to them. A leader is someone that carries a collective from one point to another. For example, one can lead someone to prosperity the same way you can lead someone into poverty. Both are leaders because they are the prime navigators. A ruler, then, is an owner and a leader is a driver. A leader is only an authority because a collective has chosen to follow their path but a ruler moves the collective where they see fit as his/her property\". Donald Trump has taken his position as president and abused it. His actions are much like a dictator. He taunts the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un because he is a dictator and rules his country as an autocracy, but does Trump really behave that differently? He appears to fire anyone who stands up to him and anyone who stands in his way. He smears and slanders anyone who wants to take a different approach to him or who questions his policies. I have no doubt that if it were legal he would imprison them too. He continues to attempt to ban the movement of people traveling from certain Muslim majority countries to the US despite this action being ruled against in federal court (this shows complete disregard and contempt for the rule of law while illustrating the lengths he will go to in order to get his way) He also wants to build a wall between Mexico and the US. Both of these actions effectively creates and 'them and us' scenario, isolating 'his' country and 'his' people from anyone and anything that HE deems a threat to HIS ideals. Surely both these actions are something that should be voted on by the people? Isn't that the democratic way? He is a man gone mad with power, and absolute power corrupts absolutely! Trump most certainly behaves like a ruler, and that alone is what makes him \"bad\". Trump is as close to a dictator than any other president in history and the only thing that stops him from 'ruling' absolutely is the democracy within the constitution! ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting wording of the question. Most have answered why Trump is a \u201cbad leader,\u201d but (unless the question has been changed) you ask \u201cWhy is Trump considered a bad ruler?\u201d I have never thought of any of the previous 44 POTUSes as \u201crulers.\u201d Perhaps, as far as \u201crulers\u201d are concerned, he would not be considered a bad one. If he had full authoritarian power, as most rulers have had, perhaps he would have been as good as Castro, Stalin, Hitler, Noriega or any of the other nefarious rulers we know of. He is a bad ruler because our Constitution doesn\u2019t permit rulers. Instead, as much as Trump would like to think otherwise, he is stuck being a mere Executive, whose powers are supposed to be equal to the Legislative and Judicial Branches. The other difference between the POTUS and a ruler is the President works for the people, not the other way around. ",

He is the embodiment of unchecked greed, racism, bigotry, sexism, lack of compassion, and a callous disregard for our fellow man. I think he is a grifter by nature and is fleecing the office for personal gain. I think he has torn our unity beyond repair and destroyed what patriotism means and bastardized it with a form of nationalistic fervor on par with 1930s Germany. I think that history will not be kind to this era because of him and those that align themselves with him. ",
