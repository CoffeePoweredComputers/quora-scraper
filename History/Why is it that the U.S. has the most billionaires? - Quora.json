            "answer_text": "It doesn't, it just seems that way due to the press attention on a small group of Billionaires that are mostly American.  The United States has always had a spirit of entrepreneurship and government support and encouragement for innovation and incentives for business. But the world is changing, so the demographics are changing.  At last count, there are roughly 2,000 Billionaires in the world (this number is  dynamic and always changing).  According to Wikipedia (List of countries by the number of US dollar billionaires) the United States has 536 Billionaires, while Europe as a whole has 514. (Europe is about the size of the US. Germany alone has over 100 Billionaires and France - which is about the size of Texas, has 47.)  The number of Billionaires in China and India are growing as well. Asia has 578 Billionaires, with China leading at 213 and India at 90. (Note: A recent report states that Asia now has over 700 Billionaires with 596 in China http://www.hurun.net/en/ArticleS... ) So technically (according to the latest data) China has more Billionaires than the US, but they are also a much larger country. As currency and economics of each country change, the numbers are sure to change as well.  Asia's rise in the number of Billionaires is due the recent (last 20 years) of more capitalist policies that allow private ownership, and to the massive opportunities that come when a large country with no entrenched competition allows pseudo-capitalism and when the government makes it difficult for foreign competitors to set up shop.   Due to concerns about currency valuation as well as China and Russia's habit of suddenly charging wealthy people with bribery and corruption (presumably because they didn't pay enough bribes), there is a lot of money flowing out of these countries. If things get too risky politically, many of the wealthiest in these areas are likely to move to other countries as well. ",
