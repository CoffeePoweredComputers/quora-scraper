            "answer_text": "The whole philosophy of Indian social organization may be summarized in one word, varna-ashrama-dharma, which may be appropriately translated as Social Federalism. This principle of social integration or synthesis was understood as early as the times of the Samhitas in the Vedic age. The Vedic seers realized that the best and surest way of saving society from frequent suicidal chaos was to divide its members into specific groups, with well-defined functions and privileges or rewards for each.  Brahmins: Those who were associated with the field of teaching and research were called as Brahmins. Teachers, scientists, astrologers and priests were included in this category. They were the custodians of the social and spiritual heritage of the group and were to pass it on to the succeeding generations. They were to preserve the purity of idealism. Kashtriyas: They were the gaurdians of the soceity. Their duty was to maintain law and order in the society. They were comprised of Soldiers, Sailors, Legislators and Civil Servants. Vaishyas: They looked after the trade and economy of the society. They were comprised of businessman, traders and merchants. Shudras: This social group looked after the physical welfare of the soceity. They were the producers of food, clothes, fibers and other products of day to day life. They were comprised of farmers, peasants, mill workers and laborers. The Division of Society : The society was divided to ensure proper functioning of all classes, and provide a guideline to achieve spiritual and economic development of the soceity and individuals as well. To each are assigned the task true to its type, in conformity with its inherent temperament, svadharma. All together formed an organic whole. Under an arrangement such as this, there is conservation of social energies; there is no necessity of trial and error method. The segregation of people based on their Varna was intended to decongest the responsibilities of one's life, preserve the purity of a caste, and establish eternal order. This would pre-resolve and avoid all forms of disputes originating from conflicts within business and encroachment on respective duties. In this system, specific tasks are designated to each Varna citizen. Dissolution of Caste System: Despite the life order being arranged for all kinds of people, by the end of the Vedic period, many began to deflect and disobey their primary duties. Brahmins started to feel the authoritarian nature of their occupation and status, because of which arrogance seeped inKshatriyas contested with other kings often to display their prowess and possessions. Many kings found it acceptable to reject their Brahmin guru\u2019s advice and hence became self-regulating, taking unrighteous decisions, leading to loss of kingship, territory, and the confidence of the Vaishyas and Shudras. Vaishyas started to see themselves as powerful in their ownership of land and subjection of Shudras. Infighting, deceit, cheating influenced the conduct of Vaishyas. Shudras were repeatedly oppressed by the Kshatriyas and Vaishyas at will, which made them disown their duties and instead opt for stealing, lying, avariciousness, and spreading misinformation. Thus, all Varnas fell from their virtuosity, and unrighteous acts of one continued to inspire and justify similar acts of others. Mixing of castes was also considered a part of the declining interest in Varna system. Most of these changes took place between 800 BC and 500 BC when constant social and economic complexities emerged as new challenges for Varna-based allocation of duties. Aftermath: The period between 300 CE to 700 CE marked the intersection of multiple religions. As a large Varna populace became difficult to handle, the emergence of Jainism propounded the ideology of one single human Varna and nothing besides. Many followed the original Varna rules, but many others, disapproving opposing beliefs, formed modified sub-Varnas within the primary four Varnas. The subsequent rise of Islam, Christianity, and other religions also left their mark on the original Varna system in India. Converted generations reformed their notion of Hinduism in ways that were compatible with the conditions of those times. The rise of Buddhism, too, left its significant footprint on the Varna system\u2019s legitimate continuance in renewed conditions of life. Thus, soulful adherence to Varna duties from the peak of Vedic period eventually diminished to subjective makeshift adherence, owing partly to the discomfort in practicing Varna duties and partly to external influence.  /hope this helps:) thanks for reading.

            "answer_text": "First and foremost, Varna Vyavastha of ancient times is entirely different times from the caste system of the present days. It was more for the well being of the society. There were only four Varnas, unlike the innumerable castes. They were Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaisya and Sudra. People were divided into the four depending on their personality and the occupation. Lord Krishna says the same in Bhagavad Githa. Chatur Varnam Maya Srishtam Guna Karma vibhagasah. The four Varnas are created by me based on Guna(character or personalty) and Karma(work done). The same is confirmed by Manu. Janmanaa jaayathe Sudrah Sanskaarath Dwija uchyathe Everyone is born as a Sudra only. Depending on his Sanskaara, he is a Dwija( any of the other three Varnas). It generally so happens that a son takes after the profession of the father. One can observe it in the modern society also. It was in the best interest of the society that one should follow only one profession. Hence the clear cut division of the society was made. There was no rule that one born to a man of one Varna can not take up the profession of another Varna. Kings of Sathavahana, Sunga and Kanva dynasties were Brahmanas. Chatrapati sivaji and Sri krishnadeva Raya were Sudras. Hemachandra vikramaditya( popularly known Hemu) was a Vaisya. A point not necessary here perhaps, but the last Hindu king to occupy the Delhi throne was not Prithviraj Chauhan, but Hemu. The professions allotted to Brahmanas were teaching, performing religious rites, medicine etc. Charging students, clients etc was not permitted. The rulers allotted grants which were to be used for the professional necessities only. Most of the Brahmanas were poor. An example can be seen in Dronacharya who could not afford even milk for his son, Aswatthama. Interest rate was to be 12 % on the loans given and the profit was generally about 6%.Business community could not make money by fleecing. The rules were such that the entire society prospered. One person could take up only one job. That is the main essence of Varna Vyastha. Look at the present society. Almost all the rulers have business interests. Many doctors have medical shops and diagnostics centers. Priests in temples perform religious rites in the houses of the rich and powerful. Everyone knows the losses and difficulties to the common man because of this situation. Varna Vyavastha was there to stop these malpractices. Sudras and women were perhaps denied Gayatri Mantra but they were not disallowed all the religious activities. Everyone knows the story of Sravana Kumara. His respect and devotion to his parents impressed Mahatma Gandhi. His mother was a Sudra woman and his father was a Vaisya. At the time of his death, they were doing Tapas in the forest. Satyavathi, matriarch of Kaurava dynasty was advised by her son, Veda Vyasa, to go to the forest and perform Tapas. She followed his advice and went to the forest along with her daughters-in-law to do Tapas till death. Varna Vyavastha does not distinguish between the four Varnas. It has nothing to do with the present caste system. Let us not still be ruled by the Divide and rule policy of the British and their mental slaves. At present, there is no Varna Vyavastha. Let us forget the caste system, or at least stop hating each other based on caste. Let there be only one group, that is, the group of Indians. Jai Bharath. ",
