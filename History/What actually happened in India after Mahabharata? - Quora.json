How long did Pandavas rule? Read the following after reading the answer mentioned above. The following information can be faulty and the contents may not have proper evidence. These are based on analysis and findings are not my own. I got them by reading several articles, hearing stories, people's hypothesis etc. There are possible chances that some(or all) of the information can be wrong as well. So, do not take my information as absolute. Some sources indicate that a survivor of King Janamejaya lived on. As per that, following him, there were approximately 75 Pandava rulers who ruled for the next 1500 years. One estimate says that Krishna died at around 3100 BC, the same can as the beginning of Kali Yuga. So, as per this statement, till 1600 BC, the lineage of Pandavas survived, but after that, they possibly got completely wiped of. Also, this year 3100 may not properly agree with the submergence of Dwaraka city. Interestingly, in Tamil Nadu, there is a specific caste of people who go by the name \"Pallar Community\". Apparently, their old name was \"Devendrakula\" - community created by Lord Indra. Whether that is true or not is a different story all-together. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallar Moving on, after King Janamejaya's death, the empire possibly broke down. So, even if the prince of Janamejaya lived, he may not have occupied the entire of India like Yudhistira, Parikshit or Janamejaya. Just a small portion perhaps and this is applicable to all the other Kings following him. The vast empire broke down into fragments and the earlier kingdoms might have continued. The internal conquests and fights may have caused several kingdoms to rise and fall. The exact details are unknown (to me! I think some of the others might know) From this point of time till the arrival of Chandragupta Maurya, I have no information regarding India. The exception is the present day Pakistan and Afganistan where the Indus Valley civilization prevailed. Post Chandragupta Maurya, we saw the rise of several monarchs (select specific ones, not in any order.) like Ashoka, Chandragupta, Harshavardhana, Ghajini, Babar, Akbar and their dynasties and empires.
