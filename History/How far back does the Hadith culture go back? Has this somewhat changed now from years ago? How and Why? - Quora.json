            "answer_text": "Since Mohammad saws has asked avoid noting his personal words with the fear that Quranic words may get intermixed with his own sayings and people may not be able to detect later what exactly had been Allah\u2019s words (as had happened with the Bible and Torah), the Muslim followers strictly abstained to jot down his words on stones and hides almost for half a century of his departure. But when the companions realized that the the Holy Prophet\u2019s august companions are departing from the world one by one, they got alarmed if the sayings of the Prophet might get oblivious to the new Muslims and might get forgotten in the world to come. This hastened them to rush to the living companions to grab whatever they had listened from their noble Prophet saws during his life. Paper had got invented by then making the notings easy and a craze was seen to collect the Holy Prophet\u2019s traditions form wherever the companions lived, far or near. Of course there was no harm then to jot down and gather all the traditions they had learnt from the then living friends of Mohammad saws. Thus many books came up as the result, out of which 6 became more prominent and revered and were termed the most authentic (shaeeh) Hadees books ,viz 1. Saheeh Bukhari, 2.Saheeh Muslim, 3. Saheeh Tirmizi, 4. Saheeh Abu Daud, 5. Saheeh Nisai. and 6. Saheeh Ibne Maja. While these six books are known as SIHAH E SITTA(the six authenticated book), the first two are categorized as the SIHAHEIN the 2 most acknowledged and revered books). Interestingly, among the above 6, still the first 2 are acknowledged the SAHIHAIN , or the 2 most acknowledged books of the Prophet\u2019s narrations. Notable is the fact that all the books are named after their collectors. That is Bukhari means the book compiled by Imam Bukhari of Bukhara Russia so on so forth. ",

            "answer_text": "Muslim people have had confusion with the Islamic Hadiths since they were written and there is still much debate about which Hadiths are authentic. Most Muslims have had different commitments and allegiances to Islam and the Hadiths from the beginning. Many Arabian, African and Berber tribes only joined Islam for political reasons and warfare initially. So, there is a nominalism in Islam, as long as one is born Muslim and says they are Muslim then they can live a normal life as much as possible. Many Muslims actually do not read or follow the Hadiths and many do not really like the implementation of Sharia Law. What is being seen since the European Enlightenment, Western Education in the Middle East and literacy and the internet is that more and more Muslims have been studying and questioning Islam and the Hadiths. To the point that now some majority Muslim countries have a majority of the population that are nominal Muslims at best and many more who have rejected Islam and only tolerate it as it is the culture and enforced by the Government. Iran, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria and Tunisia are examples of this. There is also a massive growth in atheism and conversion to other beliefs and religions including Christianity in many of these countries. Of course, there are still traditionalists and Fundamentalists in these countries but they are a minority now and only stay in power as they belong to the elite and Government groups in the population. Islam and the Hadiths are more and more being seen as out of date and injust in the modern world by more Muslims and that is partly why we saw the \u2018Arab\u2014Spring\u2019 movements recently and the new demand amongst young people for true democracy and freedom of thought and action. We are also seeing a massive increase to migrant to Western nations as more and more people hear and see that the West is more just, fair and has accountable governments by enlarge. The net has done a very good job. ",
