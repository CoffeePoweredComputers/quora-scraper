            "answer_text": "My family lived in Wiesbaden from \u201962 to \u201965 while my dad was stationed at the USAF Lindsey Air Kaserne. We watched Germany\u2019s economy take enormous leaps during that short window of time, and the nearby cities of Frankfurt a.m. and Mainz were indeed showcases, even with Frankfurt\u2019s thoroughly bombed out \u201cAlt Stadt\u201d still awaiting the renaissance to come (after we left.) My mother used to wonder who won the war after she\u2019d occasionally count the number of tall construction cranes that were almost growing like forests in nearly every city we visited. Even West Berlin in its westernmost \u2018burbs resembled many of her sister cities in the West. I\u2019ll never forget visiting Nuremberg several times before we left and was quite impressed at how rapidly the Germans worked towards bringing the old Imperial City back to her former glory despite the pounding she took less than 20 years prior. Contrast this to what we experienced when we returned to the States, particularly our family\u2019s home state of Massachusetts. What the 8th AF and Bomber Command yi(consisting of Canadian Lancasters) weren\u2019t able to inflict on our cities like they had on Germany\u2019s, our politicians, lobbyists, particularly tax-write off lobbist ilk, ruined our urban centers with ballpoint pens. I could go on for hours, but to what point? I sometimes hear whiny Americans who embarrass me to no end when they cry about \u201cWell, the Germans got Marshall money with our tax dollars, no wonder they zoomed past us.\u201d Nonsense. They zoomed past the Americans because they have a superior work ethic which no amount of Allied raids could pound out of the German workforce. Pride and diligence to detail beat American love for expediency. Fear of Stalin had something to do with it, which, matched with smoldering post-war resentment of Germany receiving the money did wonders to distract American taxpayers from seeing just who stood the most to gain if the Germans took their money like so many American companies, and either pissed away on things and losses they would later have the gall to write off on their corporate tax forms, but also American companies have this terribly nagging habit of sneaking their profits abroad in luxury resort countries whom we were terribly fearful of losing to the commies. Geesh. Let\u2019s face it, Germany blew right past us in their better made Benzes, VW\u2019s and even Czech-made Trabbies than our dangerous clunkers. And now we recently rewarded ourselve by \u201cvoting\u201d Trump into the Oval Office. Our Fuhrer wannabe. ",

            "answer_text": "In the most traditional sense, the Allies won and the Axis lost. But if we look deeper we can find that some who, \"Won,\" really did not and some of the biggest winners did not even have to fight. United States: The U.S. most definitely won WW2. They were away from the fighting which meant that almost no American civilians were killed (compared to the other nations). The American industry ramped up and they became the worlds #1 producer of oil as everyone else's oil fields and industrial centers were destroyed by bombs. They became the leader of the free world and the technological powerhouse which most first world counties today reap the benefit of. United Kingdom: As I see it, the United Kingdom won but the British Empire lost. The United Kingdom became another leader of the free world but because of the damage and loss of money, most of the colonies were freed and now the British Empire is no more than a few small islands around the world. France: France is in the same boat as the UK in the sense that they won the war but lost their empire. Soviet Union: The Soviet Union won the war and became a world superpower and rival of the U.S. but at the cost of millions of lives. They became a technological powerhouse also and launched the first man into space. They became the leader of the Eastern-Bloc and spread Communism around the world. They rebuilt but the loss of life was extreme. They could not hold together though unlike the U.S. Don't worry Putin will rebuild. First Ukraine, next the world. Israel: Israel wasn't even a country before WW2 but they are sovereign now because of it. The Jewish people were given a country of their own, even if it's surrounded by their enemies. Israel is a very modern nation because of WW2 which I why I list them as a winner. China: Millions of Chinese were massacred (which Japan denies) during the course of WW2 and afterwards. The Republic of China was destroyed and the People's Republic of China gained power. Many more innocents were killed but China is on the path to becoming a world superpower in the next couple of decades. China is neutral, some say it won because it was an allied nation and some will say they overall lost. Switzerland: Yep, the country thay never had to fight is a winner. All of the Nazi bank deposits made Switzerland very wealthy and because of the supplies they exported, both sides payed lots to Switzerland. Weapon Companies: These companies were the biggest winner of the war. Ford, Mustang, BMW, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, Fiat, Mosin Nagant...these companies made an insane amount of money even if they were on the losing side per se. The war effort needed supplies and weapons and these comapnies produced them for a price. Yes, many of the factories were destroyed and companies lost money because of this but just watch television for an hour and you will see at least one ot two of these companies air a commercial. Germany and Japan?: This is a bit of a stretch but because of WW2, both Japan and Germany have done amazing with their economies. Japan and Germany are leading producers of high quality products and very democratic nations with peace on the agenda. They were absolutely destroyed in WW2 but maybe just maybe, that was a good thing for both in the long run. Italy is meh but still democratic and produce some very nice but expensive sports cars.
