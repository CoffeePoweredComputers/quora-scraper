            "answer_text": "Because most societies today have determined that that is the arrangement that produces the results they want. Markets aren\u2019t an inherently good thing. A completely free market will provide drugs, slavery, and murder for hire as readily as bread and milk, if there\u2019s a demand for it. The purpose of the economy is to provide results for a society. The society is under no obligation to accept what they consider bad results just because \u201cthe market\u201d provides them. That said, \u201cthe market\u201d does a remarkably good job of allocating most goods and services, and tampering with it should not be done lightly. But if you believe that it does not work well for, say, providing health care, there can be a good reason to remove that part of the economy from \u201cthe market\u201d, or at least to heavily regulate it.

            "answer_text": "This is due to the influence of money and politics. Once a corporation or association becomes strong enough they seek carvouts from the government that give them an advantage which creates the command part of the economy. It puts into governments hands the right to pick winners and losers in the economy. Pure Free Markets are the only way to lift society as a whole out from under poverty. It is when the government gets involved that we end up with a tilted market that favors one sector over another. Of course that does not mean that we should have no government oversight, but that should be limited to making sure that there is a level playing field so the markets can function. ",
