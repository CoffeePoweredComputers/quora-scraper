            "answer_text": "Shivers the answers seem to be many. From Trump back to ancient greece and Rome. Of note to me is Tesla/ Edison feud. Edison employed a lab and many employees for his later work. Who was the first to actually fly in the usa.the wright bros original plane has not been able to be recreated successfully to fly.the original plane is on display in the Smithsonian as a result of an interesting contract agreed to and signed by the wright bros estate in 1948 a year after Orvilles death. Look it up in google.nb: Lawrence hargreaves is credited as the first in australia re flight as he was experimenting with boxkites.this research waS published prior to wright bros; who always denied as to any knowledge of this. American PBS had a great series on this.summary is that on testing for flight by the USA army around beginning of WW1 , the army picked Curtisairplanes. The growth of development from 1905 in flight was severely stymied by patents granted to the Wright bros.yet when testing against others.the Glenn Curtis designs were ultimately selected ,changing tbe design of aviation for the future. The growth of any Newish Religions.. mormons and Joseph Smith\u2026 The chuch of Scientology and Ron l. HUBBARD ALL of these seem spurious and when you positively research them .many holes exist . Notalable is the claim of Moses finding stone tablets in the desert.This is similar to Ron Hubbard being directed by aliens to publish their.or his writings.Next is The Book of Mormon foud in 1830 by Joseph Smith written on gold plates,found where? In the desert again. Here in Australia over the past 50 or so years weve seen various other factions etc .the Bagwan .the beatles in the late 60s with indian mysticism.the ORANGE people. Overall you do have to believe in something.there seem to be so many willing to take your money and your belief system.knowledge beats all , and reveals all. GOD is in all of us. ",

            "answer_text": "Thomas Edison.  The man who children are taught invented hundreds upon hundreds of contraptions that paved the way for the modern era was one of the largest cons of the late 19th - early 20th century. Edison made much of his profits off of stealing other\u2019s devices while suing the actual inventor for stealing his idea. Examples of so-called Edison inventions include: The light-bulb: Electronic light was first created in 1809 by sir Humphrey Davy, by 1844 reliable electronic light had been achieved by Jean Foucault. Edison\u2019s patent was dated 1880. The motion picture: The first moving pictures were created by French-American painter Luis Le Prince by 1888. Conveniently for Edison, Le Prince disappeared ilong with his patent papers in 1890 after boarding a train. Edison filmed his first film in 1891. The electro-magnetic voice recorder: The earliest sound recording device had been created in 1859 by \u00c9douard-L\u00e9on Scott de Martinville. Edison\u2019s recording device was not utilized until 1877. The Battery: The battery was first invented by Alessandro Volta in 1803; Edison stole the patent as one didn\u2019t exist in the united states. By 1899, the Swedish inventor Waldemar Junger had invented a modern battery. Edison patented his battery in 1901. He was less of an inventor as he was a businessman. He created the first film trust in North America, controlling the movie industry for over 20 years. He spent much of his time in a grueling war against Nikola Tesla, In which he famously electrocuted an elephant in an attempt to show how dangerous Tesla's AC motor was. To recap, Thomas Alva Edison was a sly businessman who spent much of his time stealing others' ideas, making money off of his film studio, and winning lawsuits. In short, he was one of the biggest con-men of the 20th century.
