            "answer_text": "A World at Arms is probably the definitive WW2 book. It could be intimidating for a beginner however. It helps you look at the bigger picture if you know your world geography(especially the Pacific), I'd suggest brushing up on that if you're not a geography guy. It's not a book, but check out the history documentary World War 2 From Space. It's pretty informative for a history channel show, although it has the Western bias that most History Channel shows have.  Churchill's 6 book set is really good too. I believe it won a Nobel Prize for Literature, although once again, it could be intimidating for a beginner. ",

The Guns of August, by Barbara Tuchman Tuchman captured the Pulitzer Prize and won international acclaim with this classic account of the opening month of the Great War.

The Price of Glory: Verdun 1916, by Alistair Horne A classic account of one of the battles that represents the horror of trench warfare.

The World Crisis, 1911-1918, by Winston Churchill Churchill's brilliant account of the war years when he served in several capacities: First Lord of the Admiralty, an infantry commander in France, a Member of Parliament, and the Minister of Munitions. As usual with Churchill, splendidly written. ",
