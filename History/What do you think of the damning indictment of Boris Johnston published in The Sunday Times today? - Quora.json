            "answer_text": "Murdoch just wanted to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d and BJ was the vehicle. BJ just wanted to be PM, and brexit was the price we have to pay. BJ\u2019s ambition is fulfilled. Everyone in the tory party knew and knows that he is a lazy sod and a liar, as presumably does Murdoch. So, all agreed, BJ \u201csadly will be too ill to continue\u201d ahem. Gove one suspects (who notably has stayed well out of the public eye for the last some weeks so as to avoid having to explain why promises have\u2019t been delivered). Cummings could remain. The article in full It begins on the third Friday of January when the Coronavirus had started its deadly spread. \u201cThe virus had spread from China to six countries and was almost certainly in many others. Sensing the coming danger, the British government briefly went into wartime mode that day, holding a meeting of Cobra, its national crisis committee. But it took just an hour that January 24 lunchtime to brush aside the coronavirus threat. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, bounced out of Whitehall after chairing the meeting and breezily told reporters the risk to the UK public was \u2018low\u2019.\u201d This ignored advice in the medical journal The Lancet that this virus could be as deadly as the 1918 \u2018Spanish flu\u2019 pandemic that killed at least fifty million people. Boris Johnson had missed the Cobra meeting, but found time to go to a Chinese New Year celebration. \u201cThat afternoon his spokesman played down the looming threat from the east and reassured the nation that we were \u201cwell prepared for any new diseases\u201d. The confident, almost nonchalant, attitude displayed that day in January would continue for more than a month. Johnson went on to miss four further Cobra meetings on the virus. As Britain was hit by unprecedented flooding, he completed the EU withdrawal, reshuffled his cabinet and then went away to the grace-and-favour country retreat at Chevening where he spent most of the two weeks over half-term with his pregnant fianc\u00e9e, Carrie Symonds.\u201d The article continues: \u201cIt would not be until March 2 \u2014 another five weeks \u2014 that Johnson would attend a Cobra meeting about the coronavirus. But by then it was almost certainly too late.\u201d An adviser is damning: \u201cLast week, a senior adviser to Downing Street broke ranks and blamed the weeks of complacency on a failure of leadership in cabinet. In particular, the prime minister was singled out. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019re at war if your PM isn\u2019t there,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cAnd what you learn about Boris was he didn\u2019t chair any meetings. He liked his country breaks. He didn\u2019t work weekends. It was like working for an old-fashioned chief executive in a local authority 20 years ago. There was a real sense that he didn\u2019t do urgent crisis planning. It was exactly like people feared he would be.\u201d \u201cAmong the key points likely to be explored will be why it took so long to recognise an urgent need for a massive boost in supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers; ventilators to treat acute respiratory symptoms; and tests to detect the infection. Any inquiry may also ask whether the government\u2019s failure to get to grips with the scale of the crisis in those early days had the knock-on effect of the national lockdown being introduced days or even weeks too late, causing many thousands more unnecessary deaths.\u201d Furthermore: \u201cBritain was in a poor state of readiness for a pandemic. Emergency stockpiles of PPE had severely dwindled and gone out of date after becoming a low priority in the years of austerity cuts. The training to prepare key workers for a pandemic had been put on hold for two years while contingency planning was diverted to deal with a possible no-deal Brexit.\u201d This will hurt the notion the Tories are \u2018patriotic\u2019: \u201cInstead, the government sent supplies the other way \u2014 shipping 279,000 items of its depleted stockpile of protective equipment to China during this period, following a request for help from the authorities there.\u201d Johnson is castigated: \u201cThe prime minister had been sunning himself with his girlfriend in the millionaires\u2019 Caribbean resort of Mustique when China first alerted the World Health Organisation (WHO) on December 31 that several cases of an unusual pneumonia had been recorded in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in Hubei province.\u201d Devi Sridhar\u2019s warnings are highlighted: \u201cDevi Sridhar, professor of global public health at Edinburgh University, had predicted in a talk two years earlier that a virus might jump species from an animal in China and spread quickly to become a human pandemic. So the news from Wuhan set her on high alert. \u201cIn early January a lot of my global health colleagues and I were kind of discussing \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cChina still hadn\u2019t confirmed the virus was human-to-human. A lot of us were suspecting it was because it was a respiratory pathogen and you wouldn\u2019t see the numbers of cases that we were seeing out of China if it was not human-to-human. So that was disturbing.\u201d By as early as January 16 the professor was on Twitter calling for swift action to prepare for the virus. \u201cBeen asked by journalists how serious #WuhanPneumonia outbreak is,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy answer: take it seriously because of cross-border spread (planes means bugs travel far & fast), likely human-to-human transmission and previous outbreaks have taught overresponding is better than delaying action.\u201d The article spells out the realisation of danger: \u201cOne of those present was Imperial\u2019s Ferguson, who was already working on his own estimate \u2014 putting infectivity at 2.6 and possibly as high as 3.5 \u2014 which he sent to ministers and officials in a report on the day of the Cobra meeting on January 24. The Spanish flu had an estimated infectivity rate of between 2.0 and 3.0, so Ferguson\u2019s finding was shocking.\u201d \u201cThe professor\u2019s other bombshell in the same report was that there needed to be a 60% cut in the transmission rate \u2014 which meant stopping contact between people. In layman\u2019s terms it meant a lockdown, a move that would paralyse an economy already facing a battering from Brexit. At the time such a suggestion was unthinkable in the government and belonged to the world of post-apocalypse movies. The growing alarm among scientists appears not to have been heard or heeded by policy-makers. After the January 25 Cobra meeting, the chorus of reassurance was not just from Hancock and the prime minister\u2019s spokesman: Whitty was confident too.\u201d The UK would be an epicentre of infection: \u201c\u201cCobra met today to discuss the situation in Wuhan, China,\u201d said Whitty. \u201cWe have global experts monitoring the situation around the clock and have a strong track record of managing new forms of infectious disease . . . there are no confirmed cases in the UK to date.\u201d However, by then there had been 1,000 cases worldwide and 41 deaths, mostly in Wuhan. A Lancet report that day presented a study of 41 coronavirus patients admitted to hospital in Wuhan which found that more than half had severe breathing problems, a third required intensive care and six had died. And there was now little doubt that the UK would be hit by the virus. A study by Southampton University has shown that 190,000 people flew into the UK from Wuhan and other high-risk Chinese cities between January and March. The researchers estimated that up to 1,900 of these passengers would have been infected with the coronavirus \u2014 almost guaranteeing the UK would become a centre of the subsequent pandemic.\u201d Still the government was complacent: \u201cOn January 31 \u2014 or Brexit day as it had become known \u2014 there was a rousing 11pm speech by the prime minister promising that the withdrawal from the European Union would be the dawn of a new era unleashing the British people who would \u201cgrow in confidence\u201d month by month. By this time, there was good reason for the government\u2019s top scientific advisers to feel creeping unease about the virus. The WHO had declared the coronavirus a global emergency just the day before and scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had confirmed to Whitty in a private meeting of the Nervtag advisory committee on respiratory illness that the virus\u2019s infectivity could be as bad as Ferguson\u2019s worst estimate several days earlier. The official scientific advisers were willing to concede in public that there might be several cases of the coronavirus in the UK. But they had faith that the country\u2019s plans for a pandemic would prove robust. This was probably a big mistake. An adviser to Downing Street \u2014 speaking off the record \u2014 says their confidence in \u201cthe plan\u201d was misplaced. While a possible pandemic had been listed as the No 1 threat to the nation for many years, the source says that in reality it had long since stopped being treated as such.\u201d Austerity is to blame for failings: \u201cSeveral emergency planners and scientists said that the plans to protect the UK in a pandemic had once been a top priority and had been well-funded for a decade following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. But then austerity cuts struck. \u201cWe were the envy of the world,\u201d the source said, \u201cbut pandemic planning became a casualty of the austerity years when there were more pressing needs.\u201d The last rehearsal for a pandemic was a 2016 exercise codenamed Cygnus which predicted the health service would collapse and highlighted a long list of shortcomings \u2014 including, presciently, a lack of PPE and intensive care ventilators. But an equally lengthy list of recommendations to address the deficiencies was never implemented. The source said preparations for a no-deal Brexit \u201csucked all the blood out of pandemic planning\u201d in the following years. In the year leading up to the coronavirus outbreak key government committee meetings on pandemic planning were repeatedly \u201cbumped\u201d off the diary to make way for discussions about more pressing issues such as the beds crisis in the NHS. Training for NHS staff with protective equipment and respirators was also neglected, the source alleges. Members of the government advisory group on pandemics are said to have felt powerless. \u201cThey would joke between themselves, \u2018Haha let\u2019s hope we don\u2019t get a pandemic,\u2019 because there wasn\u2019t a single area of practice that was being nurtured in order for us to meet basic requirements for pandemic, never mind do it well,\u201d said the source. \u201cIf you were with senior NHS managers at all during the last two years, you were aware that their biggest fear, their sweatiest nightmare, was a pandemic because they weren\u2019t prepared for it.\u201d It meant that the government had much catching up to do when it was becoming clear that this \u201cnightmare\u201d was becoming a distinct possibility in February. But the source says there was little urgency. \u201cAlmost every plan we had was not activated in February. Almost every government department has failed to properly implement their own pandemic plans,\u201d the source said.\u201d Economic considerations dominated: \u201cOne deviation from the plan, for example, was a failure to give an early warning to firms that there might be a lockdown so they could start contingency planning. \u201cThere was a duty to get them to start thinking about their cashflow and their business continuity arrangements,\u201d the source said.\u201d Herd immunity is condemned: \u201cBut Public Health England failed to take advantage of our early breakthroughs with tests and lost early opportunities to step up production to the levels that would later be needed. This was in part because the government was planning for the virus using its blueprint for fighting the flu. Once a flu pandemic has found its way into the population and there is no vaccine, then the virus is allowed to take its course until \u201cherd immunity\u201d is acquired. Such a plan does not require mass testing.\u201d And again, herd immunity dominated the strategy: \u201cA senior politician told this newspaper: \u201cI had conversations with Chris Whitty at the end of January and they were absolutely focused on herd immunity. The reason is that with flu, herd immunity is the right response if you haven\u2019t got a vaccine. \u201cAll of our planning was for pandemic flu. There has basically been a divide between scientists in Asia who saw this as a horrible, deadly disease on the lines of Sars, which requires immediate lockdown, and those in the West, particularly in the US and UK, who saw this as flu.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s special adviser Dominic Cummings is said to have had initial enthusiasm for the herd immunity concept, which may have played a part in the government\u2019s early approach to managing the virus. The Department of Health firmly denies that \u201cherd immunity\u201d was ever its aim and rejects suggestions that Whitty supported it. Cummings also denies backing the concept.\u201d Testing was a major failure: \u201cThe failure to obtain large amounts of testing equipment was another big error of judgment, according to the Downing Street source. It would later be one of the big scandals of the coronavirus crisis that the considerable capacity of Britain\u2019s private laboratories to mass-produce tests was not harnessed during those crucial weeks of February.\u201d PPE was a failure: \u201cThe lack of action was confirmed by Doris-Ann Williams, chief executive of the British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, which represents 110 companies that make up most of the UK\u2019s testing sector. Amazingly, she says her organisation did not receive a meaningful approach from the government asking for help until April 1 \u2014 the night before Hancock bowed to pressure and announced a belated and ambitious target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of this month. There was also a failure to replenish supplies of gowns and masks for health and care workers in the early weeks of February \u2014 despite NHS England declaring the virus its first \u201clevel four critical incident\u201d at the end of January. It was a key part of the pandemic plan \u2014 the NHS\u2019s Operating Framework for Managing the Response to Pandemic Influenza dated December 2017 \u2014 that the NHS would be able to draw on \u201cjust in case\u201d stockpiles of PPE.\u201d There was a sense of drift: \u201cThe NHS could have contacted UK-based suppliers. The British Healthcare Trades Association (BHTA) was ready to help supply PPE in February \u2014 and throughout March \u2014 but it was only on April 1 that its offer of help was accepted. Dr Simon Festing, the organisation\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOrders undoubtedly went overseas instead of to the NHS because of the missed opportunities in the procurement process.\u201d Downing Street admitted on February 24 \u2014 just five days before NHS chiefs warned a lack of PPE left the health service facing a \u201cnightmare\u201d \u2014 that the UK government had supplied 1,800 pairs of goggles and 43,000 disposable gloves, 194,000 sanitising wipes, 37,500 medical gowns and 2,500 face masks to China. A senior department of health insider described the sense of drift witnessed during those crucial weeks in February: \u201cWe missed the boat on testing and PPE . . . I remember being called into some of the meetings about this in February and thinking, \u2018Well it\u2019s a good thing this isn\u2019t the big one.\u2019\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Im very very dubious of it. For a number of reasons. Firstly it tries to simply re-write history and argue that in January the current result was a foregone conclusion. This simply isn't true. The Lancet held the following opinion.  That was pretty much the scientific consensus at the time and the advice the government got. Nervtag, Sage ect were all meeting the government regularly and advising strategies. The times however amends this wildly. This was despite the publication that day of an alarming study by Chinese doctors in the medical journal The Lancet. It assessed the lethal potential of the virus, for the first time suggesting it was comparable to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which killed up to 50 million people.' Richard Horton is the editor of the Lancet. The claim is wrong. The times story drastically changes this narrative to one of overwhelming pressure to do something which is just false. The Cobra meetings have been explained elsewhere. Theres no precedent for the PM to be at every one and the Health secretary chairing a few considering the lack of real obvious risk doesn't seem problematic. We must also remember alot more was going on at the time including Brexit and half the country was underwater and needing help. The claims on PPE are frankly wrong and the government has re-buked them. Discussions on PPE supply for COVID-19 began w/c 27 January (as part of Medical Devices and Clinical Consumables), with the first supply chain kick-off meeting on 31 January. The first additional orders of PPE was placed on 30 January via NHS Supply Chain\u2019s \u2018just-in-time contracts\u2019. BAU orders of PPE were ramped up around the same date.Friday, 7 February, the department held a webinar for suppliers trading from or via China and the European Union. Over 700 delegates joined and heard the Department\u2019s requests to carry out full supply chain risk assessments and hold onto EU exit stockpiles where they had been retained.Monday, 10 February, the department spoke with the major patient groups and charities to update them on the situation regarding the outbreak and to update them on the steps it was taking to protect supplies.Tuesday, 11 February, the department wrote to all suppliers in scope of the Covid 19 supply response work \u2013 those trading from or via China or the EU \u2013 repeating the messages from the webinar and updating suppliers on the current situation relating to novel coronavirus.The NHS has spare ventilator capacity and we are investing in further capacity.PPE has become the new great buzzword of the left. The papers claims are clearly wrong here. You can verify this by viewing NHS supply chain updates. Response to Sunday Times Insight article Latest Updates on COVID-19 and Managing Demand for Products \u00bb NHS Supply Chain My main issue with the article however is that its claims are almost entirely from a single unnamed source. Now it stands to reason that the source would have to be very close to government but heres the problem if indeed he was close enough to provide such detailed information then surely he would be bound by the Official secrets act? Almost all civil servants are in some way bound by it. The internal workings of government are clearly official secrets. I don't believe anyone would break the act so he can't have been close enough to make veracious claims? I think someones been scorned by Boris Johnson and has taken their assumptions, filled in some gaps and thrown a bone to the frothing bampots on twitter using the Times as an accomplice. Who for their own reasons decided to bury a hatchet in the governments back. The claims seem flawed and the source doesn't make much sense. ",
