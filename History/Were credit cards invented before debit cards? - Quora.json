            "answer_text": "Yes, credit cards have been around for long time. In fact, if you look under Credit Card in Wikipedia Credit card - Wikipedia You\u2019ll find an interesting tidbit about the novel Looking Backward by Edward Bellamy; the novel, published in 1887, is set in a utopia and in it he uses the term credit card as a means for the people to purchase goods, though, again, as Wikipedia points out, what he describes is more a debit card than a credit card. Before there were credit cards there were charge cards. American Express and Diners Club both were instrumental in bringing the charge card into popular use. The difference between a charge card and a credit card is that with a charge card you are expected to pay full amount when due, usually monthly; whereas, with a credit card (made popular by Visa and MasterCard), you can pay the minimum, though in doing so you will also pay interest on the unpaid balance which can result in heavy debt if you\u2019re not careful. Even before the debit card there was the ATM card. The difference is that with an ATM card you can only withdraw funds from your account at an ATM (automatic teller machine), but you cannot use an ATM card for any purchases. That\u2019s why the Debit Card was rolled out, the earliest being in the mid to late 1960s (I\u2019m speaking about the U.S.) You can not only make withdrawals from an ATM but you can also make purchases with the debit card just like writing a check. Speaking from memory, I recall that debit cards really took off somewhere in the late \u201980s to early \u201890s, that I received mine from what was then NationsBank (later Bank of America), sometime in the mid-90s and that it was called a Check Card. Check Card actually made sense. It was a card you used rather than writing a check. However, there were some legal issues and eventually debit card became the globally accepted name for the card. Initially, NationsBank also charged a monthly fee for this card\u2026didn\u2019t matter if you used it or not. Just for the convenience of having one on you, they charged $3 a month. Sounds like the Bank of America we\u2019ve come to know and love, doesn\u2019t it? They learned the error of their ways as other debit cards were more successful because other banks didn\u2019t charge a fee for them. Sort of like Bill Pay. The credit union I\u2019m with charged a fee for people to use Bill Pay. They did that for years before finally admitting this was a blunder, and that it was better to waive such fees for the benefits of having their members use online banking. But nobody else, I mean NOBODY else, was charging this fee. We were the only financial institution doing it. It made no sense, and I don\u2019t doubt we lost some memberships because of it or, at the least, we have never become those members\u2019 primary financial institution. I mention this latter issue because I have no doubt that eventually they, all of them, will start charging a fee, possibly monthly, possibly in some more ruthless manner that will provide them greater profits for their esurient CEOs, COOs, and CFOs, but that\u2019s not in the foreseeable future (I hope). Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "A generation ago, it wasn\u2019t all that unusual to be out for dinner with friends or at the register with a cart full of groceries and realize you didn\u2019t have enough cash to cover the bill. But today, you\u2019re likely to pull out a debit or credit card and not think anything of it. It\u2019s hard now to imagine a time when those noncash options weren\u2019t available \u0097 especially if you were born in the 1970s or later. Credit cards have been around 1950s, and debit cards were introduced in the mid-1970s. By 2006, there were 984 million bank-issued Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards in the United States alone. Though the two types of cards may be used interchangeably, there are notable differences between them. Let\u2019s start with debit cards. Debit cards are linked to your bank account so the money you spend is automatically deducted from your account. They provide a convenient alternative to cash, especially if you do a lot of shopping online. Debit cards can also help you budget. Use your card to pay your bills and day-to-day expenses and your monthly statement will provide a good snapshot of how much you spend per month and where it\u2019s going. There\u2019s another benefit as well: Unlike credit cards, your bank balance goes down with each debit card transaction, so you\u2019re less likely to overspend. (Many banks offer \u201coverdraft protection\u201d that allows you to exceed your balance. But you\u2019ll end up paying interest, and maybe extra fees, on the money you borrow from your overdraft account.) With so many benefits to the debit card, why use a credit card at all? There are three main reasons: You can spend more than you have \u0097 or postpone paying, at least \u0097 and you typically get better rewards and better protection than you do with debit cards. Credit cards basically allow you to use someone else\u2019s money (the card issuer\u2019s) to make a purchase while you pay the money back later. If you do so within the billing period \u0097 generally, 15 to 45 days \u0097 you can avoid paying any interest on it. The problem arises, of course, when you don\u2019t pay the balance in full and are charged interest as well. That can quickly add up. If it takes you two years to pay off a $500 balance, for example, and you\u2019re being charged 18 percent interest, you\u2019ll end up paying nearly $100 more in interest. If you use them responsibly though, credit cards can offer other advantages. They help build your credit, as long as you pay your bills on time. Some also offer rewards that you can use to get gifts, cash back or discounts for products, services and special events. They also provide more protection if someone steals your card or bank information. If you notice a fraudulent charge on your credit card account, you can call the card issuer, make a dispute claim, and the charge should be removed from your balance. But if thieves steal your debit card information and use it, it may take weeks for the bank to investigate your claim and replace the lost funds. In the meantime, you may have to deal with a dwindling bank balance or bounced checks. Federal law also protects you if you need to dispute charges on a credit card, but not if you use a debit card or other forms of payment. If you paid cash or used a debit card, the retailer already has your money. So you have a lot less leverage, and there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll get that money back. But if you pay for something with your credit card and aren\u2019t happy with the purchase, your card issuer can legally withhold payment from the retailer until they resolve the dispute, and you won\u2019t be charged. If you plan to pay your bill in full each month, seek out a card that provides rewards you actually want \u0097 whether that\u2019s cash back, frequent flier miles or points redeemable for gifts. The interest rate shouldn\u2019t matter, since you won\u2019t be carrying a balance. But look for those with no annual fee. Master Life's Financial Journey Bankrate comand Compare Credit Cards & Apply Online at CreditCards com creditcards com also provide comparisons of cards by the types of rewards offered, among other criteria. Generally speaking, if you plan to use your card a lot, cash-back programs may be the best bet. It\u2019s easy to get the refund \u0097 either through a check or a credit on your account \u0097 and you can use that money for anything. Many large banks also offer debit cards with rewards, so it can be worth shopping around for them too. Compare Credit Cards & Apply Online at CreditCards com Creditcards com also provides a comparison of different prepaid and debit cards, based on annual fees, related services and credit requirements. For most people, using both a debit card and credit card makes sense. The key is not to spend more than you have with either. If you can do that, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy the benefits that each provide. Feel free to contact me on my business email on my page if you want help on any credit problem . Thanks. ",
