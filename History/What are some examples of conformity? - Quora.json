            "answer_text": "Imagine a worthless piece of rock with no intrinsic value. Now imagine as soon as you purchase the rock, it\u2019ll lose a majority of its value. In fact, the person you purchased it from will offer you 20%, tops, of what you just paid. Now imagine that rock costs a shit ton of money. Rent for a month or more. A couple of international flights. A lot of money. So: 1) the rock has no productive use for you, and 2) it is not an investment, and 3) is expensive to buy. Who in their right mind would buy such a thing?   I offer you engagement ring as a big example of conformity. \u201cHey honey, we are starting our lives together. What should I use a whole lot of money for? Investments to secure our future? A vacation to spend time together? Charity to give back? Nah, lets give our money to a cartel so we can get a rock that\u2019s good for nothing, except to tell other people we conform to their norms\u201d  Full disclosure: I proposed to my wife with a ring with a rock that she wears proudly every day. I conform too. ",
