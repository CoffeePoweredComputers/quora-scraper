            "answer_text": " To the people claiming that the USA did not lose the War of 1812, let me clarify a few points, here: The USA has most definitely LOST some wars. And these wars I am mentioning don\u2019t come in the form of the USA simply withdrawing because of some hippies protesting the government and the rest of the population chooses to agree to a withdrawal, despite potentially winning on the battlefield. Rather, you should imagine a war that was so lopsided in favour of the Americans, that their militia alone was nearly twice the size of the entire population (women, children and the elderly included) that they were fighting against\u2026 AND LOST!!!  If this type of war sounds familiar to you, I introduce to you, the War of 1812. Contrary to popular belief, the War of 1812 was not fought only in 1812. In fact, if we count the November 7, 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe as part of the same war, then the war itself actually started in 1811 when American forces effectively waged war against the native population, who in turn decided to side with the Canadians and British. Quite ironically, despite the fact that even Thomas Jefferson \u2014 who was himself personally opposed to the war \u2014 said that \u201ctaking Canada will be just a matter of marching\u201d and that even the approval to end naval impressment did not placate the Americans from commencing the invasion anyway, many modern Americans will insist that the reason they failed to annex Canada in the first place was because they never intended to. It is a convenient form of revision to suggest that the excuse for going to war in the first place had already been resolved before the first shots were ever fired, was used nonetheless, resulting in a three year war that saw a total of 50,000 deaths on both sides.  From the archives: Montrealers anxiously followed fall of Fort Detroit The issue of impressment was never even brought up during the Treaty of Ghent, despite being reintroduced once it became clear that the Americans intended to pursue the war nonetheless. Impressment simply ended later that year upon the final conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars. The War of 1812 was not the first time that the USA invaded Canada, and it most certainly would not be the last. In 1690, the USA \u2014 then under the influence of the British \u2014 besieged Quebec City under the command of future Massachusetts Governor William Phips.  The Quest for Quebec In 1711, a second failed invasion was repulsed when an American fleet was battered by a storm in the Saint Lawrence River, resulting in the destruction of most of the naval fleet. And finally, in 1775, two American forces were sent to annex Canada by capturing Montreal as well as nearly capturing Quebec City, after the Canadian population declined to partake in the American Revolutionary Wars. In order to pull off a successful invasion, the Americans went so far as to recruit Canadian inhabitants to join their army, forming the First Canadian Regiment, which would later take part in several campaigns in the American theatre in the aftermath of the failed 1775 invasion of Canada.  1775-1781: Revolting People and Benedict Arnold & Other Quebec Curios There is a popular misconception amongst most Americans as well as many Canadians who are ignorant of the past that Canada did not exist during the War of 1812. However, Canada had been referenced as a recognisable identity in its own right since at least the days of Jacques Cartier and Samuel de Champlain. The Saint Lawrence was the main natural boundary, with Canada being the lands north of the river, while \u201cAmerica\u201d was the natural terrain located south of the Saint Lawrence. In 1791, Canada was broken into lower and upper Canada, and in 1841, upper and lower Canada were morphed into the Dominion (Province) of Canada. It was not until 1867, when Canada\u2019s political system became federal that the name was once again changed to simply Canada; a name that has since remained.  The Canadas - Wikipedia Despite many of their names being changed, most of Canada\u2019s major military units were around during the eighteenth century, long before the War of 1812 ever made its way into the history books. Most of these military units would also see action during the War of 1812, as well as all the subsequent wars Canada would face in the decades and centuries to come. Canada\u2019s timing in becoming a federal entity, was, quite ironically speaking from those claiming that the USA had no interest in annexing Canada, the result of the Americans attempting to justify an invasion before, during and even after the conclusion of the American Civil War.  Canadian units of the War of 1812 - Wikipedia Since it was customary for Canadians aspiring for a military career to serve in foreign armies, some 60,000 Canadians participated in the American Civil War in the event that these veterans would later be needed for the defence of their own country. A link to Canada\u2019s forgotten involvement in the American Civil War can be found in another answer I have written, where Canadians were even blamed for the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, due to John Wilkes Booth plotting his assassination while he was living in Montreal. The fact that Jefferson Davis and his family fled to Canada as refugees also played a role in compiling \u201cevidence\u201d to support a renewed war against Canada.  David Frigault's answer to What role did Canada play in the American Civil War? Even into the twentieth century, the USA had plotted several other invasions plans, including one infamous plan which is now nicknamed \u201cWar Plan Red.\u201d Many historians also believe that had World War Two not commenced when it did, British and American relations would have deteriorated to the point that another war would have broken out in North America between the United States and its colonies versus the British Empire. Despite the fact that Americans defend the War of 1812 as a war to end British impressment, this dubious excuse is like claiming that the Trojan Wars was the result of Paris capturing Helen of Troy and angering Agamemnon, or the claim that the War of Jenkin\u2019s war was the result of a sea captain getting his ear mutilated; or that the American Revolutionary War was the result of the Boston Tea Party; or that World War One was the result of the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand and his wife.  Had the British declined to end impressment until after hostilities had started, then the proponents of the impressment theory would at least have had a half-decent argument to be made, as we could then have a debate regarding whether or not the British would have ended impressment on their own without the need to wage war. Nonetheless, despite the fact that news of the abolition of impressment was delayed, due to the unexpected assassination of British Prime Minister Spencer Perceval on May 11, 1812, the war itself \u2014 with the possible exception of a few individuals dying of disease or other natural causes \u2014 remained completely bloodless up until the Siege of Detroit in August 1812, two months after the United States has formally declared war against Britain.  The Assassination of the Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval Ultimately, the justification of war by means of ending impressment was just a convenient excuse made by the war hawks of the day who were egging for a new fight against Britain in the same way that the previous generation had done. This excuse is similar to those who today say that the American Civil War was fought over slavery, when in fact Abraham Lincoln made it clear in a presidential address that he was not willing to wage a war in order to abolish slavery. The Emancipation Proclamation also did not apply to states such as Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Delaware or any other area that was under union control at the time the proclamation came into effect, nor did it apply to certain confederate states, such as Tennessee, which were given immunity to the Emancipation Proclamation for economic reasons.  Impressment Of American Sailors by Granger 5 Things You May Not Know About Lincoln, Slavery and Emancipation If the war was about freeing the slaves, the Emancipation alone should have ended it, as it clearly stated that territories or confederate states that surrendered before it came into effect would not lose their slaves. As General Grant of the Union once said himself: \u201cIf the war was about freeing the slaves, I would draw my sword for the other side.\u201d Grant himself had a personal background history regarding slavery in his home state of Delaware \u2014 one of four union states that had slavery during the war, and also one of the few states which continued to practice it until it was formally abolished at the state level in 1868. Despite freeing his own slaves, Grant also believed that the Union Government would be acting out of proportion if it was willing to wage a war over the issues regarding slavery.  The Shadow of a Shade: General Grant and Not Fighting for Abolition - This Cruel War The same myth about slavery in the civil war has now been used with impressment to justify a war against Canada. Another interesting myth is that Canada and Britain came down to Washington with the aim of destroying the White House for tyrannical purposes. What American \u201chistorians\u201d seem to omit is the fact that the Americans, the year prior, sacked the city of York (modern Toronto), which was also the capital at the time of the war.  Battle of York - Wikipedia Unlike in the burning of the White House, where only government buildings were targeted, American soldiers at York razed the ENTIRE city, and an untold number of civilians who could not escape the fire were burned to death. During the actual looting of farmlands and personal belongings, some Canadian civilians were reportedly shot by American soldiers, and their behaviour is said to have been so vile during the two days of plundering that even some of their own senior commanders \u2014 including Henry Dearborn \u2014 became outraged.  Henry Dearborn - Wikipedia Needless to say, the destruction of Washington was quite tame on the part of the British and Canadians compared to what happened at York, and if not for the fact that a tornado came down that night and destroyed hundreds of homes (as well as killing five British soldiers who were stationed in the city that night) then the whole incident would be seen as hardly more than a footnote in the history of the War of 1812, as Washington itself would have remained far better preserved\u2026 \u2026Unlike York.  The British Burn Washington, D.C., 200 Years Ago https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-tornado-that-saved-washington-33901211/ Many Canadian artifacts have either never been returned, or have since been lost. The Canadian Mace, which was taken from the Legislative Assembly during the Burning of York, was only returned in 1934 by President Franklin Roosevelt in an effort to try and reconcile his country with the British Empire. Seeing as there is overwhelming evidence that the United States did try to annex Canada during the war and failed to do so, is as good of an indication as any that the United States did in fact LOSE the war.  Treaty of Ghent - Wikipedia Part of the Treaty of Ghent was that the United States would be allowed to retain Carleton Island (the only land change during the war) as the United States was not willing to give it up for free, and the British did not find the island valuable enough to continue fighting a war over it. Had the war not been about annexation, the question about regarding annexation of Carleton Island would never have been an issue brought up during the treaty, and the island would be part of Canadian soil today! One of the most mythical battles of the war, however, has to be the Battle of New Orleans. In American folklore, it is alleged that the British sustained such a crushing defeat, that in one afternoon alone, the Americans inflicted no fewer than 2,000 casualties on the advancing British. The reality, of course, is that number is more than the historical number of British who died during the ENTIRE war, including at sea and in the Canadian theatre. It is estimated that 1,600 British soldiers were killed in action, and that most of them were not sustained while fighting on American soil.  Battle of New Orleans - Wikipedia Battle of New Orleans The \u201cBattle of New Orleans\u201d was actually a three week campaign, consisting of five separate battles, as well as dozens of engagements and skirmishes. The British never even arrived at New Orleans. The walls of Chalmette, located five kilometres from New Orleans, was the closest that the British got to, and the actual size of the attack was mild compared to the embellished version later promoted in American history books. Over a period of three weeks, the British took 316 dead and 700 injured over multiple battles and countless firefights consisting of squads or rearguard actions. Even Andrew Jackson at first rebuked the claim that the Kentucky militia had won him the campaign, even going so far as to refer to the militia as cowards in his diary by describing his militia in this manner: \u201cIngloriously fled from the scene of battle.\u201d  Andrew Jackson & the Battle of New Orleans The Battle of New Orleans It was only while he was running for president that he decided to play along with the more \u201cheroic\u201d version of New Orleans by singing the song of the Kentucky militia repelling the entire British army.  The Battle of New Orleans Order of Battle and Scenario Rules Contrary to what some people have to say regarding the January 8, 1815 assault that witnessed 2,000 British soldiers falling within a matter of minutes, the true bloodiest battle of the war was the Battle of Lundy\u2019s Lane, fought on July 25, 1814, and the number of casualties sustained on both sides was still far less than what the British are alleged to have suffered in a single assault. It is estimated that each side took roughly 800 dead, wounded or captured, with the Americans possibly suffering slightly higher casualties. Aside from the Battle of Chippawa, fought only a few weeks earlier \u2014 the only battle which the Americans won in the war without vastly outnumbering their enemy \u2014 Lundy\u2019s Lane was the closest that the Americans came to winning a battle on Canadian soil.  Battle of Lundy's Lane | Marriott Niagara Falls Hotel Battle of Lundy's Lane - Wikipedia Americans who took part in the campaign involving the battles of Chippawa and Lundy\u2019s Lane were regarded as \u201cthe best of the best\u201d and were recruited from multiple armies and placed into a single army and trained off the front lines for the better part of the year in hopes of having an army at the European level of quality. By no means, did they represent the average American in terms of combat skill, as the American forces relied far more on quantity than quality until the final stages of the war when it was becoming imminent that a ceasefire was inevitable, due to the unwinnable war the American government had thrust itself into without gaining any notable achievements.  Winfield Scott: Defender of Irish Rights ... Once Battle of Chippawa - Wikipedia In previous battles, such as at Queenston Heights, Chateauguay, Frenchtown, Beaver\u2019s Dam and Crysler\u2019s Farm, American armies were vanquished, despite vastly outnumbering their opponents. For instance, there were fewer than 800 Canadians and British present at Crysler\u2019s Farm; meanwhile, the Americans \u2014 numbering as many as 8,000 \u2014 were completely routed from the battlefield, halting the invasion of Canada for yet another season.  The Battle of Crysler\u2019s Farm Battle of Crysler's Farm - Wikipedia The majority of artillery present during the New Orleans campaign were under the command of Jean Lafitte, a famous French pirate who was told by Andrew Jackson that he and his men would be compensated generously if they would agree to help out in the fight against the British.  Pirate Jean Lafitte Countered Governor's $500 Bounty for Him with a $5,000 Bounty for Governor Not credited for the defence regarding the New Orleans campaign were some Native Americans living in the south, who were also promised by Jackson that he would grant them their own homeland if they agreed to help him expel the British. While he was initially true to his word, Jackson would later turn on the very warriors who had fought for him, by purging them from their homes and exiling them in an incident now known as \u201cThe Trail of Tears.\u201d Trail of Tears One of the main reasons why the assault on New Orleans itself never got underway, was because the British army that did engage the Americans under the command of Edward Pakenham were never assigned to the taking of the city.  The Sad Fate of Wellington\u2019s Brother-in-Law That task was supposed to be left to the two northern armies, who received the message in time regarding the Treaty of Ghent, so they never partook in the campaign. Furthermore, disease withered down the British who did take part in the campaign, and it is estimated that no fewer than 1,000 of them died during these three weeks (more than three times the number killed in action), as the weather was also said to have been unusually grim, with rain and mud being a part of a soldier\u2019s life during these harrowing weeks. By late 1814, the Americans were in such disarray, that they felt that the only adequate defence they could put up against the British was by placing their entire army in the south, as far away from the Canadian border as possible.  James Madison Biography: Fourth President of the United States Contrary to popular belief, the New Orleans campaign was also NOT the last engagement of the war. Because the Americans refused to honour the Treaty of Ghent after the British withdrew from the region (upon hearing of the news of the treaty) the surviving British of the New Orleans campaign continued to raid other American forts and settlements, including the capturing of Fort Bowyer, which is ubiquitously regarded as the last land battle of the war involving British and American soldiers (native Americans continued to fight amongst each other for several weeks afterwards).  On this day in Alabama history: Second Battle of Fort Bowyer began - Alabama NewsCenter It is very unlikely that the war would have ended in favour of the Americans had they decided to turn down the treaty offered, as James Madison himself was so desperate to ending the war that he told his diplomats to accept just about any condition, other than the annexation of the United States itself, as a condition for ending the war. The War of 1812 was also not a war that \u201cunified\u201d the Americans, but was in fact so unpopular and divisive that it is also regarded as the war that came closest to breaking the United States, with the possible exception of the American Civil War itself, half a century later. The controversy and disdain surrounding the war also outdid Vietnam, which actually saw far more favourable support from the American population than the War of 1812 did. Even though most American soldiers who saw action during the war were from the north, it was the northern states who were most opposed to it, and states such as Massachusetts outright refused to send their soldiers to war, even though William Hull \u2014 commander at the Siege of Detroit \u2014 was himself from Massachusetts.  16 August 1812 - Siege of Detroit - Also known as the Surrender of Detroit, or the Battle of Fort Detroit, was an early engagement in the Wa\u2026 | pre ww1 | Pinterest | War of 1812, Military history and American war It is, however, still worth noting that despite the discrepancy surrounding the number of citizens from northern states who took part in the war versus those from the south, it was the south that was generally more favourable to the war, while the north was less favourable. This line of division would play out almost the same in the American Civil War when those who had favoured the war in overwhelming numbers (the Confederacy) would be pitted against citizens from states that had not supported the war (the Union). All in all, I think that it is safe to conclude that the War of 1812 was a clear-cut American defeat: They failed to take Canada, even when they had more than sufficient manpower to do so (eight million Americans versus fewer than 300,000 Canadians at the time)And the Treaty of Ghent was largely decided while the war was on American soil, with James Madison being quite open to accepting any treaty in order to end the war as hastily as possible Arthur Wellesley, who would take part in the Waterloo campaign against Napoleon five months later, was himself personally offered the job of defeating the Americans in North America, along with his veteran army that had just concluded the Iberian Wars in Spain. Despite the fact that Wellesley was himself not too keen on going over to North America, it is very unlikely that he would have been able to turn down the offer if pressed to do so. Ultimately, he would never be compelled to make that decision to go, as the Americans eventually relented and agreed to uphold the terms of the Treaty of Ghent, despite initially declining to do so for a few weeks after the New Orleans campaign had ended.  Fort Niagara War of 1812 Encampment Even though the United States may have been able to keep Carleton Island as part of their prize, I still think that the fact that a population of fewer than 300,000 Canadians \u2014 more than half of whom were either first or second generation Americans \u2014 in an agricultural society were able to defeat a population of eight million Americans from an industrial society \u2014 even when their two best commanders, Isaac Brock and Tecumseh were killed early on \u2014 is quite a feat, even by today\u2019s standards. The evidence and history speaks for itself. And the evidence is that the War of 1812 was an American defeat.  ",

            "answer_text": "What do you call a war that includes a botched invasion of your enemy\u2019s territory, your capital being burned while your government flees in the middle of the night, and accomplishment of none of your official war aims? Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the War of 1812.  Now, I know that (many) American schools don't teach it that way. We tell our kids that this was Revolutionary War: Part 2, where we go toe-to-toe with the mighty British Empire not as scrappy rebels, but as equals, and give them what-for. That this was the United States entering the world stage! Ridiculous. The war was at best a sideshow. For all of 1812 and 1813 and well into 1814, Britain had her hands full with this guy:  That's Napoleon, of course. While we were \u201cproving ourselves\u201d by sending a ragtag militia unit or two north to raid Canada and steal their maple syrup (or whatever) Britain could barely be bothered to notice what was happening halfway across the world. For two years, they had bigger fish to fry on the Continent. As soon as Napoleon had been defeated for good, the British troops showed up for real. Over a period of about three weeks in the summer of 1814, they proceeded to utterly crush our economy and burn city after city, basically unopposed. In particular, they sailed into the newly-constructed capital of Washington, DC and burned it, including the Treasury, Department of State, Department of War, both houses of Congress, and most famously, the Executive Mansion. Dolley Madison had the good sense to grab the painting of George Washington on her way out of the house to save it from the British troops (our actual president, James Madison, having left town the day before).  \u201cThanks for nothing, James.\u201d Only a timely bit of rain saved the city itself from burning to the ground. They also basically robbed Alexandria blind in exchange for its surrender, and proceeded to shell Baltimore, our richest mid-Atlantic port, among other indignities. Fortunately we managed to withstand a few of these attacks, as well as a counter-invasion in northern New York, and the British didn't really want to fight yet another war anyway after half a century of on-and-off warfare against the French. So within a year everyone had signed a peace treaty that put everything back exactly as it was beforehand. \u201cMr Madison\u2019s Little War\u201d didn't even get the British to agree to stop pressing our sailors into their Navy, which was the whole reason we declared war in the first place. But with the defeat of Napoleon, they weren't as desperate for sailors anyway, so it all worked out, I guess. The biggest end result of the war, besides us painting the Executive Mansion white to hide the fire damage, was a nice poem about a flag. That was written by amateur poet Francis Scott Key as he watched the British shell Baltimore on their way back from looting D.C. He set his new poem to a catchy British pub song and a century later, it became our official national anthem: the Star-Spangled Banner. \u201cBut wait!\u201d I hear you shouting. \u201c\"What about the Battle of New Orleans?!\u201d Ah yes, we loooove to talk about the Battle of New Orleans, don't we? After all, it gave us a bona fide war hero who would later go on to be president: Andrew Jackson, who led the defense of the city against an overwhelming British force, and beat them back anyway.  \u201cKeep fighting, men! Your deaths definitely matter.\u201d Problem is, the battle happened after the treaty ending the war had been signed \u2014 nobody involved in the battle knew; news from Europe took a few weeks to arrive by boat in those days \u2014 so it meant literally nothing and accomplished literally nothing. If Jackson had surrendered, or been defeated, or been beamed up by aliens in the middle of the fight, the British would still have been forced to walk right back onto their ships and go home as soon as the news of the treaty arrived. (Also, Jackson was a terrible president, one of our worst, but that's an article for another day). So, yes. We took advantage of a distracted Britain to poke her in the side for two years, and then as soon as they had a free moment we got our asses handed to us, our cities burnt, our economy wrecked, our government run out of town, and one \u201chero\u201d whose battle didn't even matter, and then everything went back exactly how it was. Also, a poem. We lost the War of 1812. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a bunch of answers I disagree with here. I am going to single out a passage from Brian Collins\u2019s answer: \u201cMight the governments of Afghanistan and Iraq fall to enemies of the US? Yeah, but it hasn\u2019t happened yet. The US also withdrew from Iraq, not after taking tons of casualties, but after a few years where the country was the most stable it had been since 2003.\u201d Someone, von Clausewitz maybe, said, \u201cWar is diplomacy, carried out with other means.\u201d Unfortunately, Osama bin Laden, a weak opponent, with multiple vulnerabilities, had the USA figured out. All he had to do was get the USA to appear to attack a muslim nation. Osama bin Laden, prior to 9\u201311, was a very fringe character. Even though he used his own millions, and got tens or hundreds of millions of Saudi Riyals from some of the most conservative Saudi princes, he was having a great deal of trouble raising a secret army to attack the USA. He had taken his group to Sudan, spent a huge amount of money, built the pharmaceutical plant Clinton bombed. So how many men did he raise? One insider account I read said when Sudan kicked him out, to prevent another US attack, he took just 150 followers with him. That might seem like enough, for a start, more men than Fidel Castro started out with. But it wasn\u2019t, because too many of them were illiterate, or monoglot, or too dogmatic, or just plain too unintelligent to sneak into a western country, like the 9\u201311 hijackers were able to do. The reason why Osama bin Laden had so much difficulty raising a secret army, even when the wider community of muslims, contains a significant fraction who looked down on the USA as decadent, is that this disdain for the USA fell far short of being enough for all but a very tiny fraction of them to agree to participate in a sneak attack. I am not a Muslim. I was not that knowledgeable about Islam, before I started to read about this stuff, but, in 2005, I set myself the task of reading every page from the transcripts from the Guantanamo captives annual status review hearings. I got to read the so-called \u201cevidence\u201d against them, for myself, and read their answers. You will read the phrase \u201cIslam is a religion of Peace\u201d, and you will read bitter denunciations. Well, which is it. One can read the same thing about Christianity, that it is a religion of Peace, \u201clove your enemies\u201d, St. Francis, Koom-by-ya\u2026 And yet Christians launched crusades, tortured people during the inquisition, etc. It seems that Islam, as interpreted by almost every muslim, except Osama bin Laden, his cronies, and a very tiny minority of like-minded kooks, that included some super-rich Saudi princes, believed that Islam barred launching first strike attacks. Many muslims believe that the use of force was justified if the other side attacked first. This meant Osama bin Laden could get a much larger fraction of the wider Muslim community to commit to fighting the USA, if he could make the USA attack a muslim country. By August 2001 Osama bin Laden had spent over a dozen years, and an enormous amount of money, and had raised maybe 1000 guys, most of them, frankly, losers, like Richard Reid, the failed shoe bomber. When Khalid Sheikh Mohammed brought him the plan to use airliners to crash into iconic American buildings, full of innocent American civilians, Osama bin Laden guessed he had his winning move. For him to win all he had to do was get the USA to go to war with Afghanistan. Once he had done that he thought there would be a massive change, and all kinds of USA haters would come out of the woodwork. They wouldn\u2019t be engaged in a sneaky first-strike attack, which Islam bars, instead they would be helping to defend fellow muslims. So, what should Bush have done to Afghanistan, rather than invade? Give diplomacy a chance. What if, after a few months of diplomatic pressure Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban rulers had coughed up Osama bin Laden, and his leadership cadre, and extradited them to America? America would not have actually attacked a muslim country, and anyone like Osama bin Laden, like Zarqawi, for instance, would face exactly the same problem OBL faced, only the very most extreme fringe, would sign up to a sneak attack. What most people don\u2019t know is that the Taliban was full of factions. Most people don\u2019t know that Muttawakil, the Taliban\u2019s Foreign Minister heard rumors of the 9\u201311 attack, in July of 2001, and sent the USA a warning, which the Bush administration ignored. After 9\u201311 Bush gave the Taliban a warning, to cough up OBL, but then only waited a few weeks, or a month, before attacking Afghanistan. That wasn\u2019t nearly long enough. Muttawakil, the Foreign Minister, argued with his colleagues that they should turn over Osama bin Laden. It is a tragedy the USA resorted to force. When I see Americans crowing because, a decade later, they \u201cgot\u201d Osama, I am disappointed all over again. He had already won. He had acheived his goal of turning attacking America from a prohibited sneaky sneak-attack, to an allowable defense of fellow muslims. Thanks alot Bush and Cheney. And what about Iraq? Remember the justification for the war? Prevent Saddam from launching a sneaky first-strike attack that used his vast and ready arsenal of A-bombs, nerve gas, and germ-warfare munitions. Remember what was found? Saddam didn\u2019t have any WMD. He had meekly destroyed all his WMD, after his defeat in 1991, just as he was ordered to. Yes, he said he had destroyed them. Yes, he was a liar. But he wasn\u2019t lying to the USA and UN inspectors. His lie was to his enemies, dissident elements in Iraq, and his immediate neighbors, like Iran. Keeping his unstable Sunni fraction in power required his enemies, internal and external, to have doubts, and suspect he had fooled the inspectors, and had hidden WMD, somewhere, he could use if the dissidents, or angry neighbors, attacked him. Bush and company had to move quickly, which is why they invented all those terrible, incredible lies. \u201cYellow cake Uranium\u201d, the bizarre claim Saddam trained al-Qaeda fighters to use his WMD, the mobile labs, aluminum tubes. It was all crap. After the invasion apologists, like Collins, retreat to Iraq is in better shape than it was under Saddam. Bzzzt. Sure, Saddam was a brutal guy. His security forces used torture, to keep the population in order, and maybe even for fun. But this level of routine violence was dwarfed by the death toll of the invasion, and worse, the occupation. When the US had rolled over Saddam\u2019s forces the Bush administration appointed this guy Bremer, to govern Iraq, with, essentially vice-regal power. Bremer got to spend $19 billion dollars the United Nations had been administering, under the Oil for Food program. And Bremer blew those funds, like a drunken sailor. Iraq\u2019s water plants, for drinking water, and sewage treatment, had largely been destroyed in the war. Big US firm Bechtel got the contract to repair all the plants, for $2 billion. Yes, billions with a B. Bechtel made some efforts, but, in the end, did not repair a single water plant. However, that sweet-heart deal Bremer signed with them, let them keep the $2 billion anyway. If a huge number of Iraqi kids get cholera, are painfully sick and dying for a week or so, and then actually die, under the most painful circumstances, and that was all the fault of the USA, isn\u2019t that worse than Saddam\u2019s torturers killing dozens, maybe hundreds, of dissidents. When Saddam\u2019s Iraqi torturers brutally and painfully murder other Iraqis, it is an internal Iraqi matter. But when the USA is responsible? Colin Powell called it the Pottery Barn rule, you broke it, you own it. Personally, it seemed to me the Bush-Cheney team rushed to invade Iraq before the international inspectors definitive report made clear he had no WMD, because, they feared, his regime would then collapse, and they would never have an excuse to invade. So, no, I will not agree that Iraq should not be classified as a defeat. ",

Bush\u2014Afghanistan and Iraq epic disasters for American foreign policy. Considering the United States spends more than $500 billion a year on war, almost as much as the rest of the world put together, we don't seem to be getting much bang for our military buck. Fourteen years later, the American war in Afghanistan looks like a disaster. The country's government and people despise us, the Taliban once again control much of the country, and more heroin is exported than ever before. Afghanistan has become America's longest war, that early \"victory\" a mirage. Iraq is much worse;more than 300,000 Iraqis have been killed, and 1.4 million have lost their homes. Christians and other minority groups have emigrated or been slaughtered. The country, once reasonably well integrated, has been transformed into sectarian ghettos.

            "answer_text": "Of course, many times. Some have argued that there has to be a military defeat to \u201close\u201d a war. That is poppycock and completely misunderstands the nature and purpose of warfare. Military operations are only one narrow aspect of warfare, which has been described as \u201cpolitics by other means.\u201d In fact, wars are sometimes won and lost without combat at all. The Cold War is an example. That was our only existential war since WWII. As the USSR disolved along with its global empire of satelite states and alliances, they lost, we won, even though we never directly engaged in declared combat. One needn\u2019t suffer a military defeat to lose a war. We spent years, billions, and tens of thousands of American lives in Vietnam and failed in our goals. That is a loss, however one wants to dress it up. Likewise, we have so far not won our war in Afghanistan. Since we haven\u2019t left, one might argue that we haven\u2019t lost yet. However, given what we have spent in blood and fortune, and how much we have discarded our objectives, I think that is not a strong arguement. We \u201cwon\u201d the initial phase of the war in Iraq, the phase of major military objectives. We overthrew Sadaam Husein. Most of our other objectives though, establishing democracy, free markets, political stability, a geopolitical ally, even hearts and minds, was largely a big loss. We are still at war with North Korea over sixty years later. That one is more of a mixed bag, given the political and economic success of South Korea and our establishment of such a strong military presence in the region. But if North Korea succeeds in building an ICBM and nuclear payload that can reach the US, it is hard not to see that war as a major loss. Sometimes to win a war (or lose) all that has to happen is for the clock to run out. So yes, the US has lost many wars. In general we still like to dress them up as wins, or at least \u201cnot lost.\u201d Not a very realistic or helpful assessment though, and the rest of the world has little trouble recognizing our losses.

Lets look at some of the options refute this claim: Vietnam: the Vietnam conflict, despite having United States military personnel in the region for the protection of the government of South Vietnam and the massive movement of military forces to fight against the North Vietnam military and Viet Cong, Southern Vietnamese insurrectionists that supported Ho Chi Minh\u2019s push for control of a united Vietnam , No official declaration of war was ever put forth by the President and the Congress of the United States, and the Vietnam war between the North and South did not conclude until around a year and a half after the complete withdrawal of the United States under the administration of President Richard NixonKorea, we are still technically involved in a military stand off with the North Korean government, as we did declare war on the North Koreans, but an agreement was reached, no peace treaty was ever written, except for that with the United Nations, therefore the Korean War is technically going on, just at a standoff, as a result of UN peacekeeping ideasWar on Drugs, this war is a metaphysical fight on crime and is unwinnable, but there are ways to reduce drug use in the United States, if certain measures were taken, saying that one can fight the drug trade and crime that comes about as a after effect, such as prostitution, sex and firearm trafficking, is like saying that one can go fight Lucifer, nonetheless, the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d is a war against crime not on that specific tradeMogadishu- A UN peacekeeping mission, this was a collective failure of the Clinton administration, but once again no official declaration of war by the United States government under the administration of Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton attempted to wage war with the government of Somalia, which at the time was led Mohammed Farrah Aidid and his tribe, whom the UN was trying to arrest and try for crimes against humanities.I am not saying that U.S. in infallible of military catastrophe that would cause a lost , I am saying that until this point in around the 230 years that the United States has been a nation, the U.S federal government has not yet lost an official war.

            "answer_text": "Yes, the USA has lost wars multiple times in fact, but no loss has ever involved a full-scale invasion or occupation of the continental USA. Korean war. The USA failed to defeat North Korea. That is a loss. This is mainly because thousands to millions of Chinese (PRC) soldiers flooded into Korea to push the USA and its UN forces back.Vietnam war. Similar loss: the USA failed to defeat North Vietnam or aid South Vietnam. Eventually the communists unified both north and south and took over. Vietnam seems to be a big enough country to handle itself (with 100 million people), but it also got some big help from China (and to a lesser extent Russia).Syria war. The USA came in, bombed the place, murdered and dislocated millions of Syrians, but failed to do much else. Last year, Trump announced a withdrawal of troops. Not much was achieved except increased hatred towards the USA from Arabs and Muslims.Iraq war. It is true that the USA killed Hussein and wreaked loads of havoc in the small Arab nation. However, the USA has not been able to achieve any other goals such as restructuring the country in its own image (which is something that Iran seems to be better at doing).Afghanistan war. It has surpassed the Vietnam war as the longest war in US history, and the US has still failed to reshape the country in its image. True, the US took out Osama bin Laden, but the Taliban is still alive and kicking, and the US has failed to extinguish them. They say that the first Afghan war in the 1980s was the death knell of the Soviet Union. Perhaps the USA\u2019s similar failure in this Central-South Asian nation is an sign for things to come.COVID-19 epidemic. This is no conventional war, but to be bluntly honest, the US federal government is doing a pretty bad job containing the pandemic. Cases increase by 20\u201340 thousand a day. People are still going out, running around. The infrastructure is in a mess, the treasury is printing a ton of empty money that will only come back later to haunt the economy, the political parties are smearing each other, the very poor and minorities (African-Americans) cannot afford the same medicare as the elites, people are going out to buy guns to protect themselves. The US has adopted a cruel social darwinistic approach to this virus. It has shut its borders to the world, to Europe, to the west, putting America first. What the US needs to do is get its act together and start cooperating with others, including China, who can help supply much-needed face-masks and other chemicals for making medicines.The point is that the USA is not invincible. History has proven this multiple times. And the USA\u2019s mishandling of COVID-19 pandemic actually reveals the the vulnerabilities of the USA, its political system, its economy. One need not fear the American eagle, especially if its talons are crippled. Addendum: Some would actually argue that the USA won the War of 1812 and kept Britain out. Sure, the Brits burned down the capital, but that is more like a humiliation at worst. The USA still kept the country to itself, and leaders like Andrew Jackson were celebrated for their victories in places like New Orleans. ",

The \u201cwe just withdrew\u201d bullshit is not a reason to call it a victory. Yes, you did kill 1 million commies. But what you fail to understand is that you have a different view of human life than the Viet Cong. Your goal to establish a democratic government in a unified Vietnam. North Vietnam wanted to take over the south. So who achieved their goals? Obviously the North Vietnamese. If you didn't win, you lose, alright?War on DrugsThe goal was to reduce drug activity and trades. To this day, USA spends $500 million to aid Columbia in their fight against guerrila groups and illegal drug traders. This includes the invasion of Panama and the Bay of Pigs operation, and pretty much every operation under the label of \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d. Nothing much was achieved. So ..War on TerrorAlthough not an official war, it is the label for wars in the middle East and Afghanistan. Yes, Iraq was a victory, but it was a total disaster too. They are still in trouble. You are getting your ass wooped in Syria and Afghanistan could have been short work for the US army, not a war that lasts for 16+ years. Not just the US army. The entirety of NATO members that participateOther than that, I can't really think of anything else ",

            "answer_text": "Several\u2026. but in US-American perception they are not called as lost wars: War of 1812 aka The British-American-War aka War-of-Independence-II Corea War Vietnam War Gulf War III War in Afghanistan Now, what is my definition of a defeat? Whenever you do not achieve your strategic aims defined in the beginning of the war, you lose it. It\u2019s not battles that let you win the war alone\u2026 So with this definition: War of 1812: officially the result was a \u201cstatus quo ante bellum\u201d (draw), but because the British had a nice BBQ in Washington I think it\u2019s a defeat. The USA were lucky as they got out with a black eye only\u2026 :-D Corea War: positively seen it\u2019s a draw! CHECK YOUR NEWS! ;-) :-D Vietnam War: defeat! Because the strategic aim of limiting the expansion of communism was not accomplished, South Vietnam was invaded. Gulf War III: defeat! The idea was to get rid of Saddam Hussein and his alleged WMDs (that have never been found) AND implementing a stable democracy. The country slipped into chaos and the formation of ISIS was the result: FAIL! The situation became worse. It would have been better if the USA had not done anything in Iraq! :-D War in Afghanistan: until now a defeat! But it\u2019s my country\u2019s defeat as well - I am from Germany. This war has been part of the war against terrorism. The idea was to implement a democracy as well and stabilize the country. Please check your news about Afghanistan. Now, why do the US-Americans behave that way? Ignoring the fact that they have lost wars as well? From my point of view: It\u2019s about that they do not want to admit to themselves, that all those Soldiers who lost their lives in those wars died in vain for nothing. So US-Americans pretend to themselves that those soldiers sacrificed themselves for victory. Even if no victory was achieved. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s impossible to list every single conflict the US has been involved in, so I will limit this to the main wars. TLDR: I listed 14 wars. 10 wins. 1 civil war. 1 controversial(1812). 1 loss(Vietnam). 1 uncertain(Afghanistan). Basically 10\u20131 with a couple grey areas. An interesting note: the only war that can be definitively stated as a military defeat would be the War of 1812. Every other war the US either outright won or had a good mix of wins and losses. Revolutionary War(1775\u20131783) USA(with help from European countries, notably France) vs Britain and Indians - a clear-cut political victory, even though the USA lost a great many battles. I would say militarily it was mixed at best.War of 1812(1812\u20131815) USA vs Britain and Indians - one of the strangest wars in US history. Very few casualties on both sides. There is actually a lot of confusion as to what the goals were for the US, which is why you will have people on both sides declaring victory. My assessment is that this war was mostly a loss for the US militarily, as they lost most battles, but a political victory, as they gained grudging recognition from the Brits as an independent country, along with access to vast quantities of Indian land previously under the control of the British.Mexican-American War(1846\u20131848) USA vs Mexico - victory for the USA, both militarily and politically.Civil War(1861\u20131865) USA vs CSA - given that the USA never recognized the Confederate States of America as a legitimate country, this battle is technically between citizens of the same country. Thus \u201cvictory\u201d in the context of this question is irrelevant.Spanish-American War(1898) - USA vs Spain - victory for the USA, both militarily and politically.Indian Wars(1600s-early 1900s) - USA and European countries vs Indian Tribes - this is one of the most controversial wars in US history, and has invoked a lot of accusations and claims by both sides. This was not one single conflict, but thousands of individual conflicts featuring different Indian tribes and different groups of US and European people. The conflicts started long before the US became a country, but the wars were continued after the US was formed. I will avoid making any type of comments on this, I will just say that clearly the USA won this war both militarily and politically.World War 1(1914\u20131918)(USA only fought 1917\u20131918) - USA and European allies vs European enemies - a lot of claims are made about the effect of US involvement in WW1, ranging from no effect to being the decisive point in the war. I will simply say that the US involvement certainly helped. As to how decisive, I will bow out of this one. Politically and militarily a win for the USA.World War 2(1939ish-1945)(USA only fought 1941\u20131945) - USA(and allies) vs Germany, Italy and Japan - this is also debated as to whether the US \u201cwon\u201d the war. The best explanation I have found declares it this way. The war was won with British guts, Russian blood and American industry. Each member(including our other allies) were essential to winning the war. Without any one of these 3, winning would have been immeasurably more difficult, if not impossible. Politically and militarily a win for the USA.Cold War(1947\u20131991) - USA vs Soviet Union - no battles between the two, but proxy wars fought in Cuba, Korea, Vietnam, and others. Political win for the USA.Korean War(1950\u20131953) - USA(and allies) vs North Korea(and allies) - while technically this war is still going on, South Korea was liberated and the unofficial war ended in 1953. Tensions are still high, but at this point, it is certainly a political and military win for the USA.Vietnam War(1955\u20131975)(most fighting from 1963\u20131969) - USA(and allies) vs the North Vietnamese(and allies) - an overwhelming military victory for the USA, but a political loss.Persian Gulf War(1990\u20131991) - USA(and allies) vs Iraq - an overwhelming military and political victory for the USA.Iraq War(2003-???) - USA(and allies) vs Iraq - I\u2019m not sure if this is still categorized as still going on, as the results of this war continue to this day. Militarily this is an obvious US win, and politically too, as the US forced the Iraqis to sue for peace. However, this is a very controversial war in the USA(and abroad), and this war has not helped the USA\u2019s image internationally. Still a victory, but with an asterisk.Afghanistan(2001-present) - USA(and allies) vs Taliban - another controversial war that is still going on. Militarily the US has certainly got the better of the Taliban, but it has been quite clear for a number of years that this war cannot end in US political victory. I think that is why you have seen Trump begin negotiations with the Taliban on multiple occasions. Hopefully he(or the next President) is able to get us out of there, or at least negotiation some sort of agreement where the vast majority of the fighting stops. Military win, but political loss(or mixed).",

            "answer_text": "On January 8, 1964, President Lyndon Johnson announced his \u201cWar on Poverty,\u201d just one more of the \u201cwars\u201d lost by the United States. 50 years later, poverty still exists, despite the U.S. government having spent trillions of tax dollars to combat it. Far from being an invincible superpower, the United States has actually lost many wars, and here we list 10 of them. Depending on your politics and opinions, you may not agree with all of them. Please feel free to chime in with your thoughts about these \u201cwars\u201d and on any others you feel the U.S. is also losing. Digging Deeper 10. War on Poverty. With the U.S. poverty rate at 17% when the initiatives introduced by Johnson were instituted, the years since have seen the poverty rate sink as low as 11% but then climb as high as 15%, staying between those percentages ever since. Today 47% of taxpayers do not even earn enough to have to pay income tax, and the gap between rich and poor is greater than any other time in the nation\u2019s history. The groups that benefited the most from Johnson\u2019s programs (Medicare and Medicaid especially) were the elderly and those under 18 years old, while the poverty rate among those ages 18-64 years has basically remained the same. At an investment of $15 trillion, the return has been low and the achievements modest. For the very little gain, it has been catastrophic to the national budget. Over 46 million Americans remain in poverty, the highest number in U.S. history. 9. War on Drugs. The \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d continues today despite every indication that this campaign is not a winning one. The U.S. appears to be powerless to stop the influx of cocaine, heroin and marijuana from outside the country, while almost every city and suburb has residential \u201cchemists\u201d making ecstasy, LSD and crystal meth in their basement laboratories. 8. War on Terror. Meanwhile, the U.S. has been fighting a \u201cWar on Terror\u201d since 2001, but at what cost? Iraq and Afghanistan are more filled with terrorists and are more unstable than when initially invaded. Trillions of dollars have been squandered, not to mention the thousands of dead, crippled or psychologically scarred military personnel and civilian contractors. It is not surprising that the U.S. military is currently experiencing the highest suicide rate in its history. 7. War in Viet Nam. Of course by now most Americans realize the Viet Nam War was lost. The fact that the North overwhelmed the South and imposed their brand of communism on the whole country is proof. It is true that the U.S. military performed quite well and killed many more soldiers of the North Vietnamese Armey (NVA) and the Viet Cong (VC) than they themselves lost (perhaps a million or two Vietnamese for the loss of less than 70,000 Americans), but in the end, the war cannot be classified as a success. 6. War of 1812. Many scholars consider the War of 1812 a war lost by the U.S., with British troops burning the capitol among other cities such as Buffalo, New York. While the U.S. did manage to win the last battle of the war, American forces failed to take any part of Canada, and the grievances that precipitated the war had largely already been resolved before any hostilities started. 5. The Cold War. One has to ask, did the U.S. really win the Cold War? Or, were there no real winners? Spending incredible sums on weapons and \u201cintelligence\u201d certainly has kept the U.S. from progressing and its citizens from enjoying anywhere near the standard of living they could be. Sure, the Soviet Union broke up under the weight of its expenses, but what did the U.S. gain? Despite the United States\u2019 status as the only \u201csuperpower\u201d left standing, not much else was gained, except perhaps for some defense contractors being richer. 4. War on Christmas. Some people today would say the U.S. or perhaps the world for that matter, is also conducting a \u201cWar on Christmas,\u201d an effort by secular or atheistic people who want to eliminate Nativity scenes from public places and replace \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d with \u201cHappy Holidays.\u201d Alternatives offered include Kwanzaa and Festivus (\u201cfor the rest of us\u201d) or maybe a return to acknowledging the winter solstice. With the amount of decorations, sales, marketing, parades and flood of television specials, Christmas is still winning this war. 3. War on Women. Democrats and other liberals are fond of saying that the Republicans and conservatives are conducting a war on women. This war is being fought through the opposition of equal pay for equal work statutes, the limitation or prohibition of abortion and no government subsidization of contraceptives. Of course, the right wing claims they are conducting no such war, but if they were, they would certainly be losing it because women are in positions of power like never before. 2. War on Unions/Middle Class. Like the so-called \u201cWar on Women,\u201d the war against working-class people is allegedly being fought between the right and left political factions in American politics. \u201cRight to work\u201d and similar laws that gut unions as well as idiotic tax codes that make moving manufacturing out of the country profitable are killing the American worker and destroying the \u201cmiddle class dream.\u201d Furthermore, convoluted income tax laws end up costing successful workers a higher percentage of their income in taxes than filthy rich people have to pay on income made through capital gains investments. Disappearing medical benefits, vacations holidays, and the rolling back of laws that mandate time-and-a-half pay for overtime are some of the results of this conflict. We would not say the American worker is defeated, but things are not going very well for the working and middle class. 1. War on Crime. Although violent crimes such as murder and car theft occur less often than they used to, the average American is under the impression the country is some sort of fire-free zone. Police are exhorted by politicians to be active and \u201cproduce\u201d (tickets and arrests) but are then thrown under the bus when the public cries that they are are bullying them with \u201cstop and frisk,\u201d \u201cbroken windows,\u201d and DUI checkpoints. In addition, there are an incredible amount of abuses of corporate power that oftentimes nearly ruin the country, and, unlike the poor man who writes a bad check, none of the big bankers or investors go to jail. Statistics may make it seem that the good guys are making progress, but it just does not feel like it. ",

Result: Decisive defeat. World War I: Only entered 1 year before the end to take credit and war-profiteer. The Germans were already defeated by this point. Result: Limited Victory. Financial gain. World War II: Only entered 2 years before the end, because they were caught up in the war in the Philippines. Did not take part in key battles such as Battle of Britain and Stalingrad. But undoubtedly helped win the war in the pacific.In Europe on D-Day had some of the easiest beaches to storm, but take most the credit for it. If Russia hadn\u2019t crushed Hitler on the Eastern front by that point German forces could\u2019ve re-deployed West and would\u2019ve likely made D-Day a disaster for the allies. Campaigns in Europe such as \u201cMarket Garden\u201d a disaster. Patton was incompetent. Result: Limited Victory. Captured Nazi scientists which gave them advancements in nuclear and rocket technology. Forced to arm former Nazis in Western Germany to counter the \u2018Iron Curtain\u2019. Did not see conflicts coming in Korea. Did not deal or foresee with the Communist victory in China, let alone Indo-china. Korea: Phase I: Almost took all of Korea. Victory.Phase II: China got involved, UN got pushed back all the way past Pyongyang. Stalemate. Result: Bloody stalemate, arguably a defeat. Vietnam:Failed objective to reunify Vietnam or at least protect Southern Vietnam. Then failed to stop Communist take over of South Vietnam. Military disaster even if they \u201cchose\u201d to pull out of the war. Still a crushing defeat.Laos and Cambodia also fell. Human casualties and financial costs appalling for absolutely no meaningful gains. Communism eventually fell anyway due to it being unsustainable and Vietnam invading/liberating Cambodia 6 years after the fall of Phnom Penh. Cuba: Bay of Pigs a crushing defeat. Poor invasion plans. Poor equipment. Totally underestimated Castro. Iraq/Libya/Afghanistan: Total defeats. Democracy only exists in the Kurdistan Autonomous Region. Obama armed \u2018rebel\u2019 groups that actually turned out to be ISIL or AL-Qaeda and got rid of Gaddafi and Saddam with no idea who would replace them. Arguably the worst defeats in US history in what it has cost nations and people who weren\u2019t even involved, 16 years later. ",

            "answer_text": "Officially, no. At no point has the US been forced to surrender to another nation. There are only two disputable wars that most people bring up. War of 1812 - The US officially declared a draw with Britain. Although the White House was burned, the US obliterated Britain in New Orleans. The US and Britain eventually agreed to end the conflict rather evenly.Vietnam - The US spent over a decade pounding North Vietnam and her allies into the dirt. Although it came at the cost of 50,000+ plus American Soldiers, the North Vietnamese lost far more militarily as you would expect. However, the US never actually surrendered. By 1973 the US withdrew from Vietnam, leaving the country of South Vietnam to continue on its own. Although North Vietnam would soon defeat South Vietnam, the US withdraw wasn\u2019t a surrender.Militarily the US never lost a war. However, whether they strategically lost any conflict is another matter. In that situation you\u2019d need to analyze what the US goals were as compared to their enemies goals and then compare to see who accomplished what. Under this analysis, you can make a good argument that the US never won in Vietnam, to which I\u2019d agree. However, upon just viewing the military side of the conflict, the US has never lost a war. Edit: Some have gotten rather testy about me asserting that US didn\u2019t lose Vietnam, and have sent me messages because of this. Let me explain why I stand by this statement. The US never lost a major battle in Vietnam. For over a decade we pummeled the North Vietnamese, inflicting a combined total of over a 1 million losses over the course of the war. In 1973 the US brokered the Paris Peace Accords, which was a peace treaty ending the war and establishing both North and South Vietnam as separate governments. The US proceeded to end its military involvement in the region, similar to what happened in South Korea. However, the US also ended any commitment to defense and funding. After 2 years North Vietnam proceeded to break the peace treaty and invade South Vietnam. Without American financial support, the South quickly folded. Since the US military was not present after 1973, having voluntarily withdrawn and left South Vietnam to continue the fight, it is impossible to assert that the US was militarily defeated. ",

            "answer_text": "What wars has the U.S. lost? Beyond the conflicts the U.S.A failed to win, or to achieved their strategical objectives within (like in Vietnam, but also Afghanistan or Syria), there\u2019s one worst the U.S.A has most certainly lost : The war for its respectability as the leader of the Free World. In July 1945, the U.S.A had this opportunity to appear like a triumphal benevolent World-Power, and a peacemaker. The contribution of eminent Americans like Henry Ford to the reindustralization of the Nazi Germany before WW2 was already forgotten, while its role in the liberation of Western Europe and the Pacific was acclaimed. The genocidal nuclear strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki when there was, from the word of Eisenhower, Mac-Arthur, or Chester Nimitz, ongoing talks for peace with an already defeated Japan, but still capable to defend its mainland, ruined that in my opinion and led the U.S.A on a whole different path : the path of Supremacism, where nothing is forbidden because it\u2019s always \u201cfor the greater good\u201d.  Nagasaki, august 1945 The wars in Korea and Vietnam demonstrated that the U.S.A became ready to set the world on fire and slaughter millions in order to achieve their strategic goals, way beyond their own defenses and the defense of their interests abroad. Iranian democratic State was converted into a dictature for oil by the U.S.A & the U.K, South America suffered the martyr under U.S backed quasi-fascist and violent Leaders, Afghanistan felt into Islamism due to the first Afghanistan war, Somalia suffered even worst due to the U.S schemes there in the late 80s. Then it was the turn of Iraq (Kuweit was just an oil pump for the U.S.A & allies). The Cold-War ended, but the party never ends. Instead, NATO was brought into it. The \u201creset\u201d started in Yugoslavia, of which the U.S.A destroyed the remains in Bosnia and Kosovo (Serbia) through wars backed from Washington since their inception. Then it was time to clean the mess in Afghanistan (undone until today), then Iraq again with the U.K, then Libya with the French & NATO, then Syria to mop ISIS (whom the U.S are responsible for the existence of), and now Yemen is being bled by Saudi Arabia, main ally of the U.S.A with Israel in the region.  If that was not for the global power (economic, cultural, military, diplomatic) of the U.S.A, we\u2019d have a hard time to find anyone supporting them anymore in the World to lead the Global politics. Now Iran is on the line, and beyond the enemies of Iran (Israel, Saudi Arabia), and the U.S most dedicated vassals (Germany, U.K, Australia, N.Z), there is hardly someone still present to back-up the American fairy tales about going to war to preserve peace, while a few other nations are also supporting widely the U.S.A out of their extreme dependence on the U.S military (Poles, Albanians, Baltic People, South-Koreans). Trump\u2019s verbal wrath is laughed at, as are the U.S flase flag operations and self-justifications. Even in the 80s and 90s, we Westerners were raised in the love and admiration of America. A lot of water passed under the bridges since then, and now, the whole post-WW2 period is easily unfolding thanks to the courtesy of web-browsing to those eager to know better. The U.S.A are still influential enough to change cap and restore their respectability out of their might : no one would be foolish enough to not encourage good moves for peace from Washington. That would be a change. But I don\u2019t think that the U.S federal State, its deep State, its powerful politic and military lobbies and its hungry multinational companies are ready for that. And hence, the War of all wars, the war for peace, cooperation among nations, and global prosperity is constantly on the loosing path : beyond Western and central Europe and the individual allies of the U.S.A, the World has to struggle, often without the possibility of doing so, against the U.S led Occidental predation, and it seems to be endless, even if the Western blocks currently shatters because of Trump\u2019s administration unusually aggressive behavior toward the U.S Empire.

            "answer_text": "This question isn\u2019t very easy to answer. \u2018War\u2019 is a rather subjective term when used in a non-legal context. In US law, Congress votes to declare war, while the President actively commands the military conflict and has powers to deploy US forces. Nowhere in the US Constitution though, does it say Congress formally declaring war is the only way to have a war. Out of the times the US actually declared war, the only time the US arguably did not come out on top was in the War of 1812. The court decisions (or decisions to ignore even hearing) Doe v. Bush and Massachusetts v. Laird, imply that simply authorising military force is enough for the President to send in the military to engage in a military conflict. The US has been in undeclared wars since 1794. It\u2019s not like you can even convincingly argue \u2018the Founding Fathers never intended!\u2019 because the Founding Fathers themselves authorised military force in the Quasi-War without declaring war. Out of undeclared wars, it is still easy to argue either way without conducting significant mental gymnastics. I think out of undeclared wars, everyone would agree, for example, that the US beat Panama because at the end of the day, the Panamanian government fell, US troops won every engagement, and the former dictator of Panama was in a US prison until 2007. For Vietnam however, the situation is much more complicated. I mean here are some ways you can argue: Yes the US lost: The US failed to prop up South Vietnam.The US withdrew, and South Vietnam was toppled by North Vietnam.The US achieved absolutely none of its political objectives from the war. It failed to contain communism in Southeast Asia. By sheer dumb luck, Vietnam invaded Cambodia after the Vietnam War and became an enemy of China, but that had almost nothing to do with the US\u2019s objective to contain China, and was more the result of conflicts between communist leaders.All of this, and the US spent billions of dollars and took 60,000 casualties doing it, while taking over 10,000 aircraft casualties.The US drew down troops after taking increased casualties.No, the US didn\u2019t lost (at least not directly): US troops inflicted far more casualties than they sustained. This is something both Vietnam and the US agree on, while their numbers themselves do disagree. I find this one a bit ironic, as it also viewed as one of the flaws in US strategy during the war, but I think it is a point.The Tet Offensive was a complete failure. North Vietnam took tons of casualties, and wasted tons of resources, but took very little ground. The US lost in the way the media portrayed this however.The US only lost a handful of battles the entire conflict. Yes, the US wasted tons of lives, equipment, and resources holding useless hills in the jungle, but they usually held those hills. It wasn\u2019t like North Vietnamese troops stood upon a field of dead, smouldering, American remains victorious. The North Vietnamese attacked, lost, attacked again, lost, attacked again, lost, US public opinion slowly became more against the war, attacked again, lost, the US withdrew troops, replacing every one 1 for 1 with a South Vietnamese troop, attacked again, won, attacked again, won.When Saigon fell, there was not a single US combat troop on the ground in Vietnam. There were some intelligence personnel, and embassy guards, but the US withdrew years earlier\u2014the US\u2019s ally, South Vietnam definitely lost.Both of these arguments occur all the time, and you find military experts and historians who fall into both camps. In any case, yes the US debatably lost Vietnam. I think for other conflicts though, such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, I think it is very premature to say the US lost. Casualty rates look nothing like Vietnam, and the US-backed government in Baghdad was at least able to stop ISIS from taking their capital city before the US got involved. Afghanistan is a similar story. Some people seem to interpret defeat as \u2018the US withdrew\u2014must mean they were forced out.\u2019 Might the governments of Afghanistan and Iraq fall to enemies of the US? Yeah, but it hasn\u2019t happened yet. The US also withdrew from Iraq, not after taking tons of casualties, but after a few years where the country was the most stable it had been since 2003.  When you compare the number of US troops with casualties:  It\u2019s not like the US withdrew because it was taking enormous casualties. The US withdrew once casualties slowed down (simplistically implying that they won). It looks nothing like Vietnam. ",

            "answer_text": "In war, the results can be called outright victory, Pyrrhic Victory, a draw resulting in a cease-fire or truce, or even a treaty of peace or cessation of hostilities, or a loss. A loss can be categorized in a few ways: loss of the military and/or political goals of the war in the face of the enrmy\u2019s response; loss of an irreplaceable number of men or war equipment such that fighting cannot continue; total defeat on the battlefield followed by or solely due to, invasion and occupation by the enemy concurrent with the surrender of one\u2019s sovereignty to the enemy. As military loss alone is defined, the US has lost many battles, but never one time has she lost any war. As military/political loss is defined, the US has never one time surrendered to any enemy, nor sued for peace to end any war from the position of military weakness. The US has never \u201clost\u201d a war. Losing a war is catastrophic. Even negotiating a peace from the position of military insufficiency (the inability to win the war) can be socio-economically devastating as in the 1919 Treaty of Versailles\u2019 crushing sanctions on Germany. The War of 1812 is probably the closest thing to a loss in battle of a war the US has ever had. The result was best described as a truce, neither side so clearly in command on the battlefield as to dictate terms. Many know that the Battle of New Orleans, the US\u2019 most lopsided victory in that war, happened after the Treaty of Ghent had already been signed. This for some reason seems to lessen the battle\u2019s ferocity to many. But the combatants did not know the war was over. The fight was very real, desparate, bloody, and despite being outnumbered 3-to-1, Jackson\u2019s Americans routed Cochrane and Pakenham\u2019s larger British force. Many know that, but most don\u2019t know that the war began when the US declared war of the UK in response to the English blocade of France, America\u2019s chief Revolutionary War ally. Or that the US invaded Canada as part of the UK. Or that British troops in Canada and native Canadian colonials repelled the American invasion. The war ended status quo ante bellum, meaning \u2018the way things were before the war\u2019: nobody won but nobody lost. Korea was a cease-fire. Still. Militarily, MacArthur was on fire, but politically, he was trouble, and Truman and the rest of the UN didn\u2019t want to fight China to the death over Koryo. So the UN withdrew to an agreed-upon line, and fences were built and gun emplacements and radars, and the Mini Cold War goes on. Vietnam was not a loss. Vietnam was a we quit. We shouldn\u2019t have been there, our involvement was manufactured, our politicians were not behind the war effort; one President micromanaged the war sometimes to Company level, another wavered on his committment to ending the war and in the middle of it went all stupid and embroiled the country in its worst political scandal; the country was ripping itself apart on a very large scale over an unnecessary, unjust, hated war, and finally, everybody just said stop. In Vietnam, we quit a war we never should have started. We can debate the Sand Box Wars\u2019 values, but militarily, it is clear that America-led Allies cannot be beaten by the enemy. Their only victories are political and propaganda. Again, America just quit most of its involvement. Just packed up and left after telling the enemy the date, and now because all the enemy did was hide and wait, we\u2019re sending more Americans back in because either the job wasn\u2019t finished or because we should believe that the same bowl of alphabet soup with new letters floating on top but the same cast of characters in the broth represents a new threat to the US. What is the only war the US ever lost? If I\u2019m alive when it happens, we won\u2019t need to ask or answer. ",

            "answer_text": "The Vietnam War is more known because the Americans had their Casualites televised by the American TV and the American people became seriously sad because they saw their parents dying and going to Hell in Vietnam's jungles, Taking shots at vital regions(like the head) and and exploding into traps or hit by panji stakes in the legs, arms and other parts of the body, which generated strong scenes to those watching.This acts made Americans protesting for an end to the conflict Immediate and generated a Huge pressure on the Government, after a few years, in 1973, began the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam.  Right at the moment when the Americans discovered the Vietnamese subterran hideouts and were destroying the ammunition storage areas and food of these shelters, and the Americans radars and missiles had been improved (and stopped to fail) and the F-4 Phantom fighters won 20 mm cannons, which allowed them to take down MIG (s) Vietnamese at close range, also at that time the Americans had adapted to the hot and humid climate of the place.Then in 1975 the Americans got out Vietnam.Although it has lost 58 thousand Americans, most killed more than 1 million Vietnamese, Americans as got out Vietnam and failed to meet its objective, which was to prevent all Vietnam became Socialist, many historians consider this as a defeat.  It wasn\u00b4t exactly a war, but a Very Disastrous Operation, the Operation Gothic Serpent, in which US Operators of Delta Force and Rangers were in Somalia to protect the UN Acts, during a genocide(or a Civil War) in 1993,Till a day, Americans made a Mission, in which, they have to arrest Somalian warlords,but the militiamen shot down 2 Black Hawk Helicopters and kill 18 American Soldiers.Some dead crew members were filmed having their bodies dragged and beaten through the streets of Mogadishu.This caused an outcry and even though the Americans have killed more than  Thousand Somalian Civilians and militiamen, immediately the people put pressure at the government to bring forth out American troops from Somalia.  Another wars that many people consider Yankees Defeat, were the Iraq War(1991-2011) and Afghanistan War(2001-2014), where the Americans withdrew due to high $$$ cost. Good part of the objectives was not reached and the other was not achieved in totality,Violence not over, and in the case of Afghanistan the Taliban and Al Qaeda still exist, and even in Iraq the situation is worse, because the country is dominated by ISIS and the prewar situation was much better than the current (after US Intervention in Iraq) if US didn\u00b4t kill Saddam,the situation could be better,If they installed a Chamber with each religion representative and tribe representative, and inspect her, being impartial, just and Possessing the Right to Use the Force, being a harsh on Saddam Hussein not to make a dictatorship, the situation would be Better,maybe with less violence) The guerrillas took to the mountains and caves where it is difficult to access, and so when the Americans tried to attack them, suffered heavy casualties by heavy machine guns DShK on the top of the mountains(at the enter of tha caves) the insurgents and their shooters better positioned when attacked by land, the mountains also weared out the soldiers and when they attack from the air was shot down by RPG and other AA equipment. Since there was few(or no) solution, the Americans were labeled as $elfish,and only intervenes and only interested when you have oil or Raw Materials in situation (or place). As well that are situations similar to the Vietnam, however, in these two cases, the Number of American Casualties was lower, and the High Financial Expenses too but the situation appears to be resolved, did the withdrawal of troops (The damage done and the deaths of the heads of terrorist organizations ) gave the certainty of yankee victory .After 2011 in Iraq and After 2015 in Afghanistan the situation seems that nothing has changed that situation seen in the pre-invasion period.

            "answer_text": "Contrary to other answers: Officially, yes. The united states has lost 8 wars since the american revolution, the first of which being Red cloud\u2019s war [1866\u20131868], where the United states were in battle against various native american tribes. This battle ended with land given to the natives. During this time, in 1867 america lost the Formosa expedition, a short war where the Americans retreated after a single casualty. The United states were also involved in the Russian civil war in 1918\u20131920. The allied powers had to retreat, ending in a communist victory. The U.S. also lost another civil war, the Laotian civil war from 1953\u20131975, where the U.S. was defeated and Lao people\u2019s democratic republic was established. The U.S. lost the Bay of pigs invasions against Cuba in 1961. The most notable defeat was the Vietnam war, taking place from 1965\u20131973 and a quick uprising in 1975. Where the U.S., South Vietnam and a few other countries lost to North Vietnam, the soviet union, north Korea and a few other countries. The U.S. lost the Cambodian civil war in 1967\u20131975, with the fall of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The United states\u2019 most recent loss was from 1982\u20131984, during the Lebanese civil war. Just to be clear, the United states did not lose the war of 1812. The United states just suffered great losses. To note these are documented losses. They are conflicts where the U.S. had retreated [not through force of the other nation] or unoccupied the space of war. The U.S. has never surrendered, but these are defeats in which the United states retracted their forces. ",

            "answer_text": "The United States got its ass handed to it in the Vietnam War, which nearly brought down our country financially. The objectives of creating a separate country in the South in order to restore Western colonial ownership of plantations, corporate agriculture, and mineral rights there was never realized. According to the Pentagon Papers the U.S. spent most of the war looking for any way out that did not embarrass its military. The original objective of splitting the country North and South and establishing a friendly government that the people of Vietnam would accept in the South failed by 1963. The US doubled down and expanded the war looking for a military victory of some kind so that it could declare victory and get out. The U.S. was wracked by civil unrest, much of it anti-war. By 1972 the U.S. economy was wrecked from the war. The U.S. had double-digit inflation and could not pay for increasing need to the importation of oil. The price of gold started to rise and Nixon had to cancel the Bretton Woods agreement taking us to the money we have now which is so easy for the government to print. The Vietnam War very nearly wrecked the U.S. According to the Pentagon Papers, Vietnam was not about Communism but even if it was it did not achieve that goal either. The U.S. lost because it aggressively attacked another country that knew how to fight back. Defense is less costly than attack. Vietnam was supplied with weaponry by the U.S. Cold War enemies. The U.S. lost the very first major battle in the la Drang Valley. The U.S. should have known at that moment that there was no chance of winning but doubled down instead, escalating the war because a de-escalation would have been too big an embarrassment. ",

            "answer_text": "The United states is not really old enough to have participated in many wars, and wars that are considered to be \u2018won\u2019 by countries are mostly either classical or semi classical warfare before the advent of self loading or breach loading firearms. The last real single country on single country big power vs big power wars which involved capitulation of either party really has to be the Napoleonic wars, or even back further such as England VS Scotland, the forging of the various European continental empires such as the Austro-Hungarians/Byzantines/Ottomans. These large scale expeditionary conquests which involved the forging of nations are all before the time of the US- a product of colonialism with a very short (just over 200 year old) history. The big point here is the US was formed in the gunpowder age, and has never known bladed conflict with classical formations. It also was very very young during the industrial revolution and most of its history is one of mechanical/industrial growth. Just like the child who can play with an Iphone at 6; you give a young nation gunpowder and industry it is going to be better at using them than its \u2018parents\u2019 because they are still living on long lost memories- The British, for example still use two fingers as a swearword to commemorate a victory 600 years old, 3 times older than the US! In this modern age warfare is usually fought in alliances and gone are the days of absolute raping/burning/capitulation and humiliation of a nation (with WWII having been an exception, but it could be argued that WWII was really a battle between the \u2018parents\u2019 with a complicated history of hundreds of years of previous wars, ethnic tensions, kingdoms and hangovers from the Napoleonic era that America could not have possibly understood the concept of as a young nation) and most modern wars are really skirmishes and involve allies in complicated, non historical or ethnic contexts- there was no historical reason Australia and the US should deal with France and defend Vietnam, for example. So the US, as a standalone nation has not had any definitive \u2018wins\u2019 or \u2018looses\u2019. But none of the other big power countries have any stand alone wins since before the creation of the United States, either. I guess we should all be thankful that most of us are far removed from the days of total war and not really worry so much about chalking up the score. There is no real winners in a war anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "America has taken part in few \u201cdeclared\u201d wars. Even the KoreannWar, which it lost, was described as a \u201c\"police action\u201d. Of course this is a very touchy subject bye to for Americans,because for them patriotism and militarism are a kind of religion. Hence all the vulgar flag-waving, historic distortions by Hollywood, and the reinvention of history that follows to cool out the patriots. The US only really wins wars against minor or negligible powers, such as mighty Grenada, the Philippines, Mexico, and Panama. In situations when it fights alone it tends not to do very well. But in alliance with more experienced military forces it tends to prevail, e.g. The first Gulf War, WW2, lt can\u2019t be said that they won the Second Gulf war invading lraq, since that conflict is still ongoing. Same with Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Lebanon, Somalia and so on. Of course after Hollywood, the media and patriotic fervour has finished with it, the average patriot sees them all as victories. The most dangerous parts of American culture are it\u2019s isolation and lack of experience. They are protected by two wide oceans,and have never experienced a war. By contrast Russia, having lost 27million in WW2 , would never be so zealous about bombing other countries as the Americans because they know how it would feel. Americans are basically like children, and that is the best way to approach them. They are shallow, simple, childlike and easily led. They only have to see a US flag to salivate subservience. They care little for the facts, so don\u2019t bother giving them any. If any nation would start WW3 it would be the Americans. Their military are completely out of control, the ignorant boorish thug-like Generals like a Mad Dog Mattis, can barely express themselves and revert back to the sort of playground language l heard as a child. The average citizen is gullible, naive, poorly-educated and simple. I heard a lot of \u201che\u2019s my President he must be telling the truth\u201d assertions. Americans are without a sense of irony or self-mockery, so they are serious and mean what they say. Anyway, to answer your question, historians doubt that the US has tecynically won any wars since WW2, but point out that it has been at war for 95% of it\u2019s history, without signicant Success. lt is currently bombing 9 countries simultaneously and is militarily active in 147 of the world\u2019s states.

            "answer_text": "Kind of the inverse to the question has the US ever won a war. I should think the answer is yes. Regardless of what right wing nuts say, Vietnam was a clear loss. Korea certainly wasn\u2019t a win and considering consequences we are experiencing today, it is looking more loss than win. I certainly would call Afghanistan a win. The war is 16 years old this year. I can\u2019t see the Iraq incursion a win either and we are still mired down in that mess. None of these losses or non-wins can be laid entirely on the military. Wars the US doesn\u2019t win is largely owing to unrealistic political objectives and ignorance of the axiomatic \u2018never start a ground war in Asia.\u2019 I suppose defining won/loss should be decided on achievement of objectives. None of the above wars ever had clearly defined goals that remained constant. In World War II, all of the Allies agreed not to establish independent peace with Axis powers and to fight for unconditional surrender of the enemy. Was the goal of the Korean War re-establishing the border between North and South Korea? Or was it the reunification of Korea? I think MacArthur believed the latter while Truman had other ideas. Eisenhower wanted the conflict resolved one way or another. The goals in Vietnam were so confusing 42 years after the conquest of Saigon by the North I remain unclear why we were in Vietnam in the first place. The \u2018Domino Effect\u2019 was rubbish in 1965 when we consider that Ho Chi Mein was our guy in Indochina from 1941\u20131946 receiving funding and weapons through OSS. We screwed the Viet Mihn by dropping support for Ho and supporting French efforts at re-colonization. The 1975 Paris accords between the US and North Vietnam were largely identical to the 1955 accords between France and North Vietnam. If the US had not let bin Laden and company escape at Tora Bora in December 2001, that would have pretty much ended al Qaeda and the US could have left Afghanistan to the Taliban. Considering how crazy they are maybe that wouldn\u2019t have been such a good idea. Still, defined strategic objectives would have been helpful. The Iraq conflict was completely unjustified although getting rid of the Iraqi Ba'athist certainly wasn\u2019t a bad idea the entire affair was completely mismanaged and merely made rich Americans a lot more richer\u2014crony capitalism in its \u2018finest\u2019 hour. I should mention the Philippines-American War 1899\u20131902. This was very ugly and brutal. It\u2019s unclear to me what McKinley\u2019s goals were when the war began. In 1900, Roosevelt and Taft began what was called \u2018the policy of attraction,\u2019 which by 1902 had managed to win many Filipino adherents. In 1916 the Jones Act guaranteed Philippines independence but a large degree of home rule had already been established with the first elected assembly in 1907. Since the US never actually established a clear strategic objective it\u2019s hard to call the results a win or a loss. I think this might best be decided by the Filipino people. It\u2019s quite possible that if a US presence had not been established in 1899 the Japanese might have moved in long before 1941. Again, Filipinos should decide whether Japanese or American colonialism was preferable. I honestly don\u2019t know how contemporary Filipino people feel about this. I suspect US backing of the ludicrously corrupt Marcos regime from 1965\u20131986 has likely tainted Filipino views of pre-war American governance. Marcos was one of Reagan\u2019s autocratic non-communists; hence Marcos victims were largely ignored. Had Marcos been a socialist I have to believe he never would have survived 21 years, ending his days a rich man living in Hawaii. ",

WWI and WWII were \u201csimpler\u201d wars, in which a certain empire would want to expand their territory, and then the rest of the world would have to say \u201cno no, go back to your own country, we\u2019ve got our own thing going here\u201d. Even then, V-Day, the victory of Allies over evil Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, resulted in the only two atomic bombs ever deployed during military conflicts, which caused millions of deaths instantly, plus millions more after due to radiation effects. So sure, we won, but do you feel like celebrating? If you do, a good visit to Arlington VA Cemetery would be a great place to go and spend some time. Lots of great things were accomplished at extremely high prices. Then you move onto Korea in 1950s and until now, that\u2019s not been resolved yet, and there is no good outlook for the foreseeable future. Vietnam? That\u2019s quite a ways away!.. We went to help, but faced immediately the first traces of guerrilla warfare. Everyone looked alike, you couldn\u2019t tell farmers from viet congs, and despite so many years and deaths, what were the achievements? Certainly a most honorable service for all those who bled and left their sanity and survived that place. But Victory? certainly don\u2019t think so. Gulf War? We did kick the iraquis back to Bagdad, but to what cost? what did we benefit from it? Saddam remained in power, but no victory or loss was recorded in my book. And the list of this new type of warfare continues, Iraq II and III (Bush Era and Obama Era), and Afghanistan. We went there, and what did we accomplish? All of these conflicts are no longer under the old frame of reference \u201cwin-lose\u201d. They\u2019re \u201cLose-Lose\u201d by those terms, but now qualified as \u201cadvantageous, or non-advantageous\u201d based on many variables calculated by the administration in turn.

The war on christmas is by all accounts still going strong, although I am still seeing christmas decorations up when I drive around town, and christmas music still haunts my dreams. Vietnam went pretty shitty for us, though it\u2019s tough to find someone willing to call it a \u201closs.\u201d The War of 1812 ran through like 1814 and ended in a stalemate, though the White House was burned so I\u2019m gonna go ahead and call that one a loss just on principle. And also, you know, we tried to take over Canada, and that clearly didn\u2019t work, so it feels like even more of a loss there. The War of Northern Aggression was definitely lost by some of the US, although strangely those who lost it seem the least aware of that fact. The war on poverty is currently being won in a way that looks an awful lot like losing to me, whereby those in poverty are successfully being warred upon. The war on obesity might not be a real thing but if it is, we\u2019re definitely losing that one right now. I would argue that the war on terror has been decisively lost at this point, but simply expressing that would make me so very unpopular\u2026 But yeah we definitely lost that one. Strangely though, we seem to have lost it to white men. Who would have seen that one coming on 9/11, huh? I sure didn\u2019t. The Korean war comes to mind, since, you know, there\u2019s two Koreas and one of them is pretty evil looking, and that can\u2019t be the product of a win. And before you tell me they\u2019re not evil looking, I\u2019m sorry, but those haircuts are so needlessly ugly they look straight out of a comic book villain\u2019s fashion sense. Oh god, has there been a war on fashion too? I bet there has, and looking at the way people dress these days I\u2019m pretty sure we actually won that one. Fashion has been soundly defeated in the US. Does that represent a loss for us, though? So hard to say. I\u2019m calling it a draw. I guess there\u2019s a bunch, depending on how you look at it. We\u2019re definitely number 1 for being AT war with something or someone, so there\u2019s that at least! ",

            "answer_text": "Even though the United States has never lost any territory or surrendered to another country, yes. Starting from the beginning (going by Wikipedia\u2019s list of wars involving the USA) the Quasi-War was fought between the US and the French from 1798 to 1800. The US refused to pay France debts they owed from the American Revolutionary War because the French monarchy toppled during the French Revolutionary Wars, so the debts were owed to a regime that no longer existed. In response, France dusted off their best suits, knocked on America\u2019s door, and started sending privateers to capture American ships en route to England and sell them as prizes. In July 1797, US diplomats Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, John Marshall, and Elbridge Gerry arrived in Paris and soon after met with men representing Foreign Minister Talleyrand, demanding things such as a large loan to the French government and a \u00a350,000 bribe to Talleyrand. It became known as the XYZ affair. Congress authorized the gussying up of the navy, and on July 7, 1798 they rescinded all treaties with France and authorized the attack on French warships two days later. What followed was a two year war fought entirely at sea. The US only lost one ship which was later recaptured\u2014the USS Retaliation, which was actually a captured French privateer La Croyable. Hostilities eventually died down after some bickering in the West Indies and Atlantic Ocean, and the Convention of 1800 officially signaled the end of the war. The problem is, war was technically never declared. The result of the Quasi-War is officially indecisive. Fast forward twelve years, and the United States and Britain were fighting again. This time it was for a variety of reasons: Britain introduced trade restrictions on France due to a minor disagreement called the Napoleonic Wars, so the US declared it illegal under international law. Britain also was allied with a few Native American tribes who lived in what was then the Northwest Territories and now Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois and Ohio. Britain\u2019s goal was to create a \u201cneutral\u201d Native American state there, while America\u2019s goal was\u2014surprise!\u2014expansionism. So we rolled up our sleeves, and America came, saw, and\u2026kind of left after your standard wartime fun. Neither side gained or lost territory, and the war officially ended in a draw. Depending on who you ask some say that the war ended in an American win because of the victories at Baltimore, Plattsburgh and New Orleans, but some also say that it the British won because they technically achieved their goal\u2014stopping repeated American invasions of Canada) and retaining their colonies. The Utah War (1857\u20131858) ended in resolution through negotiation, giving full amnesty to those convicted of sedition and treason and replacing Brigham Young as governor, and the Second Samoan War (1898\u20131899) ended in compromise with the Tripartite Convention, breaking up the Samoan Islands into a German colony and the US territory. The only times we\u2019ve explicitly lost wars were the Red Cloud\u2019s War and US interventions in the Russian, Lebanese and Somali Civil Wars. (Wikipedia includes the Bay of Pigs Invasion since we failed to assassinate Castro as well, and the Formosa Expedition is also considered this because we withdrew.) Red Cloud\u2019s War ended with the Treaty of Fort Laramie after the Fetterman Massacre that killed 81 soldiers, a captain and the namesake, (also a) captain William J. Fetterman, followed by the realization that we didn\u2019t have enough manpower. There were divided objectives amongst the other countries that comprised of the allies during the Russian Civil War and lack of domestic support, leading to near-total withdrawal in 1920 (a couple of Japanese forces decided to hang out for a few years after) and Bolshevik (pro-Communist) victory over the White Movement. Multinational forces failed to prevent the collapse of the Lebanese Army, and they evacuated after the Islamic Jihad Organization bombed the US embassy and marine barracks. The war continued until 1990 and Syrian occupation ended in 2005. Somali National Alliance leader Mohamed Farrah Aidid wasn\u2019t captured (although he was killed after about a year of serving as president), we withdrew our forces after the loss at the Battle of Mogadishu, and the civil war\u2019s still ongoing. I\u2019m not exactly sure if I should include the Vietnam War since I know it\u2019s a hot button topic, but seeing that we withdrew and North Vietnam took over South Vietnam, leading to a communist government being implemented in the entire country as well as Laos and Combodia, I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be far-fetched to call it a failure as well.

            "answer_text": " Since the country's formation following the American Revolutionary Era, the United States has been regarded by most of the outside world as a military power to be reckoned with. However, there have been some U.S.-involved conflicts where American success has not always been the rule of the day. War of 1812 The War of 1812 lasted for two years between 1812 and 1814. It saw a series of battles between the United States and Great Britain over the issue of British violations of U.S. maritime rights. As a British colony, Canada also played an important role in the war by fighting on behalf of the British. Though the United States did not win the war in a clear-cut manner, the Treaty of Ghent was signed on December 24, 1814, restoring relations between the two warring factions. It also restored the boundaries of the United States and colonial Britain to pre-war conditions. Much of the U.S. capital of Washington, D.C. was burnt by the British during the conflict, and the young nation was shaken to its core. Nonetheless, numerous American war heroes emerged from the fighting (such as Andrew Jackson for his involvement at the Battle of New Orleans and the fight against Creeks in Alabama and Georgia). The national anthem of the United States was also inspired by the hostilities, as Francis Scott Key was inspired to pen the lyrics of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as he witnessed the Battle of Fort McHenry in the harbor of Baltimore, Maryland in September of 1814. Powder River Indian War The Battle of Powder River was fought on March 17th, 1876 in what is now the U.S. state of Montana. The event witnessed an embarrassing defeat for the United States, when a poorly planned attack on a Cheyenne encampment by Colonel Joseph J. Reynolds resulted in significant losses suffered by the United States at the hands of Native Americans. Though Colonel Reynolds managed to damage a sufficient amount of Native property, the Natives who fought bravely gained confidence from the warfare, and were able to consolidate their powers to resist the demands of the United States in the future years. After the war, Colonel Reynolds was highly criticized for his misguided tactics, including for leaving several U.S. soldiers on the battlefield in the face of enemy fire, and for losing a large number of horses. He was initially suspended from duty for a year, and ultimately never returned to service again. This battle occurred almost 11 years after the Powder River Expedition, wherein the United States' Federal forces fought against Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Sioux in what are now the present-day U.S. states of Montana, Nebraska, Wyoming, and South Dakota. This earlier expedition also ended without serving the U.S. Federal interest of securing a dominating presence and securing peace in the region. Red Cloud's War The United States lost another war to Native American forces in the Red Cloud\u2019s War. Waged between 1866 and 1868, this conflict was fought over control of parts of the Powder River area of what is now Wyoming, between the Bighorn Mountains and Black Hills. The war was fought between the Lakota Sioux, Northern Arapaho, and Northern Cheyenne as allies on one side, and the United States on the other. At the end of the war, the victorious Lakota managed to retain legal control over the Powder River Country, as per the Treaty of Fort Laramie, which was signed on April 29th, 1868. The Lakota were guaranteed ownership of the Black Hills, and maintained their land and hunting rights in the region. However, this victory lasted for only 8 years. Then, with the end of the Great Sioux War, the Powder River Country was ultimately captured by the U.S. forces. Formosa Expedition (Paiwan War) Considered to be one of the greatest failures of the U.S. Navy, the Formosa Expedition (or the Paiwan War) of 1867 witnessed the retreat of U.S. forces before the U.S. target of defeating the Paiwan natives was achieved. The battle was triggered when Taiwanese Aborigines killed the Ame. Follow me for more such content Onkar Pawar Thank you!!! ",

But look at it this way. America launched the war hoping for at least three positive outcomes. Firstly (the public pretext) to stop the Royal Navy taking British seamen out of American ships they had run to so as to avoid the Royal Navy press gangs. Secondly, the war hawks faction wanted to take possession of Canada. Thirdly, they wanted to prevent the British in Canada encouraging the Native Americans making trouble on the frontier. At the end of the war, they had basically achieved none of these. The Royal Navy carried on pressing runaways as before (though they mostly stopped simply because the war with France was over and they no longer needed the men). The Canadians beat off the American invasions, and while the Native Americans were heavily defeated and lost some important personalities, it was doubtful whether the British had really needed to agitate them, since the behaviour of some American frontier settlers was doing that quite adequately. Yes, the Americans won a few significant battles (New Orleans most notably even if late), and they took territory from the Spanish (which was never the original plan), their actual war aims all came to nothing. In the process, the US economy was trashed, Washington DC was largely burned down (in retaliation for US abuses in Canada), and of course the needless loss of life. Out of that war, America gained a national anthem, and a sense of nationhood that they didn\u2019t really have before. Not bad things in themselves, but amplified with legends to cover over just how embarrassing the war was. The British can hardly call it a win either of course. The only country that can definitely claim it as a win is Canada. ",

            "answer_text": "You could list many, but historians and politicians can never agree on whether or  not we actually \"lost\" the war in question. For example: The Vietnam War took years to fight, yet after troves of failed strategies and an unbudging communist threat still looming from the North the US withdrew leaving a small and undersupplied South Vietnamese army to fend for itself, and ultimately, succumb to defeat . So, as one school of thought would proclaim, \"you can't lose a war if you weren't there to lose it\"  South Vietnamese residents being denied transportation aboard US evacuation helicopters. Prior to Vietnam was the Korean War, the first real slugout between Capitalism and Communism in Southeast Asia. The war itself was, in essence a shoving match starting with a full North Korean invasion of the Southernmost peninsula. This outrageous offensive rattled heads in Washington who immediately lead a UN counteroffensive at inchon, continually pushing the North Korean forces back North until the fighting neared the Chinese border who, fearing the Koreans would be pushed to their border, launched a counter-counter invasion allying with the North Koreans and, in turn, pushed the joint US, South Korean, UN offensive back to the 38th Parallel where an armistace was signed, calling for a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) at the 38 Parralel. The Armistace signaled the end of fighting but not an official end to the war. Today the DMZ remains one of the most high tension areas in the world with the US still actively assisting in its fortification.  A US Army Officer and two South Korean troops actively observe the South Korean Demilitarized Zone. While these wars were not technically lost, they bear all of the hallmarks of lost wars such as public outcry and economic troubles. These wars were gauged by destruction (the US caused a trmemndous amount), yet they were conceded as lost by politics. Image Sources: 1975. Nha Trang.

            "answer_text": "The War of 1812 could be most kindly described as a draw but basically we lost it. Vietnam was pretty clearly a defeat, although people love to say we were not defeated in the field. Perhaps true, but definitely irrelevant. In terms of our war aims we flat out lost. Afghanistan has been an awful waste of life (ours and theirs) and money\u2014we won in 2001, but the war didn\u2019t end then, and we haven\u2019t accomplished anything positive. Iraq (2003) was technically a victory. Iraq (2004\u20132011) was another matter. Our supposed aim, creating a stable, more or less secular pro-Western (or pro-U.S.) democracy was not achieved and once again the war was a tremendous waste of blood, treasure and good will. The damage done to Iraq was unconscionable. It should go down as one of the worst political decisions in our history, and one of the most avoidable. People ask why we don\u2019t win our wars any more and the answer is pretty obvious. We put too much faith in what our military can do, ignore politics, and get into wars that have little or no relationship to our vital interests. Iraq was clearly flat out aggression. Afghanistan was probably technically legal, but it was a punitive expedition rather than a defensive war, and strategically stupid. Vietnam was again arguably defensible, but we approached it in too cavalier a manner and for internal political reasons. To put it in classical terms\u2014we have focused on military power without making honest assessments of political reality. Again, lots of people will claim that these failures are due to the American public\u2019s unwillingness to stay for the long term. This is true. It is also something that everyone has understood for years (before Vietnam, and long before Afghanistan and Iraq), so it is not an excuse for stupid decisions. ",

Diplomatically, we\u2019re 4\u20134\u20133. Some qualifications on my statements: The British Empire fought the Revolution with one hand tied behind its back.  It decided the American colonies were too much of  a hassle, and that India and its eastern possessions were easier to manage.World War 1 - the Treaty of Versailles was arguably the greatest diplomatic disaster of the 20th Century.  We are still dealing with the effects of it in the Middle East.Korea - Did we win the peace?  Or did we lose the peace?  Was our aim to overrun North Korea until late 1950 when the Chinese entered?  Can we honestly say we lost the peace when South Korea is an Asian powerhouse?Vietnam - There were 12 major battles in Vietnam, and the US Army won them all.",

            "answer_text": "The answer here is to part's, technically yes we have lost a war, legally we have never lost a war. how can both be correct if they are completely different answers? There is no question that the United States lost in Vietnam and Korea ended as a draw. The war of 1812 our capital was razed but we won out because of the Napoleonic War was Britain's focus. But remember I also said that the US has never lost a war. War's of attrition are not meant to conquer, but to outlast the enemies resolve. So this explains the War of 1812 since it was a war to stop Britain from seizing American merchant vessels. Let's focus then on the Korean conflict and the Conflict in Vietnam. Notice I used the word conflict and not war. In order for the United States to be engaged in a war Congress, not the President, must authorize a declaration of war. However in order to assist an Ally or stabilize a region, the President may, under the War Powers Act, put US troops in combat for 90 day's before asking Congress to go to war. At this point Congress can either declare war or stop funding the campaigns. This is what happened in Korea and Vietnam. We aided our Allies and Congress refused to declare war, yet they continued to fund the campaigns.  This is were the Media came into play. Their argument was that it was a war regardless. If the President has surpassed his time and Congress won't stop the campaigns, yet American troops are dying, it is an illegal war. This was how they reported it and how the American public saw it. So legally the United States has never lost a war, in reality we know that's not entirely true. ",

            "answer_text": "War can be defined by a means to meet a political objective for the government. So Vietnam counts as a loss in that South Vietnam was not preserved from communism, though there was no military defeat(for the US). The War of 1812 was inconclusive militarily and was a partial political victory. One of the initial reasons for war was to gain dominance of the Great Lakes and Canada, along with the issues of trade and continued independence. So was it a victory? Sort of. The Korean war was similar in objective to the Vietnam war, to preserve a non-communist Korea. Like the War of 1812, it is more or less a partial victory, because only half of Korea is US-friendly, capitalist, but not a total political loss like Vietnam. There are a number of undeclared conflicts that occurred, but I cannot think of one that the US has lost that had not been reversed after. Wars with a specific Indian group(not necessarily whole tribe even) can be called wars. Some of those amount to only a single campaign, a truce or effective end, and a resumption and conclusion later, sometimes with a fair bit of time between them or different commanders. In the end, they were all won by the US, so no\u2019war\u2019 was lost, but many campaigns or expeditions ended in defeat. An example of a lost campaigns would be St.Clair\u2019s defeat against the Western Confederacy, though the war would be won 3 years later(decisive victory) and concluded 4 years later(by treaty). In the end, all of the native american tribes have been subjected, so all the wars have been won. ",

The war \"ended\" where it started. Now if the war was to break out again tomorrow we would certainly win unless China intervened which I don't think they would. (I know they don't want the US or South Korea or Capitalism that close to their border but North Korea doesn't seem that important to China for China to get into a military conflict with the US over)  I know someone might comment on here and say \"IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN\". It's not pretty, it wasn't, some bad stuff went on over there such as abu ghraib and whatnot but we got done what our objective was supposed to be. We went in and drove out the terrorists from Iraq and into the mountains in Southern Afghanistan. We set up democratic elections, gave those countries BILLIONS in aid, built schools, hospitals, infrastructure, gave Iraq an Army. People can't expect the US to stay there and hold Iraq and Afghanistan's hand for the rest of their existence. We gave them what they needed to be functioning states and they don't want to take responsibility for their own country. That's their fault, not the US's. We accomplished our objective.

            "answer_text": "We\u2019ve only had two wars in our history that were real existential threats: the Civil War and WWII - and we\u2019re still here. We provided an assist in WWI but hardly spent as much blood and treasure as the other nations. Most of our other wars were medium-level conflicts. The Revolution, of course, was unique. The closest thing to a clear loss was the War of 1812, where our invasion of Canada was repulsed (as it was during the Revolution) and the Brits burned Washington. (Some friends. They burned Washington down in 1814, but where are they now that we really need them?) They also captured Detroit. We scored some nice wins at sea, but basically we kept our independence because Britain didn\u2019t really think conquering us was viable. Also, we were a side show in the Napoleonic Wars. As Bruce Catton said, it started after everyone had agreed not to fight and ended after everyone had agreed to stop fighting. We got a song out of it, demilitarization of the Great Lakes, and a start on the world\u2019s longest undefended border. All failures should be so successful. (I sometimes say I was present when the War of 1812 ended. I was on a trip in the Appalachians and we stopped at Natural Bridge, Va. On the trail is a saltpeter cave mined for making gunpowder during the War of 1812. A British member of the group asked what that was. After recovering from my astonishment, I realized that from the British perspective, we were an absolutely inconsequential bunch of skirmishes when they had their hands full with Napoleon. So I gave him the US version about stopping our ships at sea, whereupon he stood at attention and in his best formal British voice, said \u201cWell. On behalf of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and the British Admiralty, I most humbly apologize.\u201d So that\u2019s settled. Seriously, guys, rule Britannia! And God Save the Queen.) Vietnam and Korea were not victories for political and logistic reasons. The public was sick of fighting and in both cases it became clear that we were facing enemies with unlimited manpower to sacrifice. Tet, 1968 was the Vietnamese Battle of the Bulge and mostly destroyed the Viet Cong, except in this case, it worked. Three lessons I think we can draw from the post-WWII experience: You can\u2019t create democracy where it never existed. Both Japan and Germany had pre-war democracies (Weimar Republic and Taisho Democracy) so both countries had a lot of people who understood democracy. Spain and Portugal successfully transitioned, as did a lot of eastern European countries, because they had lots of people with democratic aspirations. Other countries like Romania and Bulgaria, not so much. In much of the world, \u201cdemocracy\u201d means the right to plunder the treasury for your client group while oppressing others. We can offer suggestions and aid but they\u2019ll have to evolve it on their own.We can\u2019t defeat insurgencies. Oh, yeah, we can if we\u2019re willing to fight very dirty and spend decades. But slam, bam, thank you ma\u2019am, like the American public wants? No.Unless there\u2019s a clear viable alternative out there, regime change merely means taking out one bad guy and allowing worse ones to move into the vacuum. Why did the U.S. back so many repressive governments during the Cold War? Look at Yugoslavia, Libya, Syria, Iraq\u2026..",

            "answer_text": "A lot depends on what you mean by \u201clost\u201d. If you accept the definition of \u201clost\u201d to mean a complete or significant failure to obtain strategic goals, then I would say the Vietnam War, Afghan War, the Iraqi War and Libyan Civil War. A critical strategic goal for all was the creation of a stable government. In South Vietnam, the government collapsed internally and externally, falling to the North Vietnamese after being weakened by the Viet Cong (who were South Vietnamese). Many people fail to recognize that the SOuth Vietnamese government was facing an internal rebellion. In Afghanistan and Iraq, the US was clueless on how to establish a stable government. US efforts in Iraq can be a textbook case of what NOT to do. In Libya, the US was dragged in to supporting Europeans in supporting the Anti-Gaddafi factions. There was no love lost between Gaddafi and the US, but the US really did not want to get involved in the mess. It was in Europe\u2019s backyard and the US let them take the lead. It is ironic in that the US did not lose any major military battles in Vietnam, Iraq or Afghanistan, but in the end failed to Win the Peace. There have been comments that the US lost the War of 1812. I disagree. The strategic goal of the US for declaring war was the impressment of American sailors, particularly off of a US Navy ship of war. Even the British recognize that the Captain went to far. Also, the BRitish were supporting the Native Americans who were raiding the US western territories. It was an inexpensive way to keep the US occupied and may have not resulted in war if it wasn\u2019t for the impressment. There have been some arguments of the US expansionist policies toward Canada, but that have been refuted. It increased US support for the war for some of the business men up north, but it was not a significant factor for declaring war. In the end, relations between the US and Great Britain improved. No territory was loss by either side. The northern border was greatly demilitarized, contributing to the longest demilitarized border in the world today. The actual issue of impressment was moot with the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the British Navy\u2019s need for men. Great Britain stopped supporting the Native Americans and the US border with them were secured. It seemed that the US was a more lucrative trading partner than the Native Americans. I would hardly call this a loss. ",

So, in a sense, the Vietnam was a triumph of sort. But the Iraq war has no redeeming qualities. The Hussein state was destroyed. Iraq, as a country, does not exist anymore and it will not exist anymore. And it looks like Syria is on the same road. The Assad state does not exist anymore. In the coming years the Kurds will try to forge a new state for themselves and all their neighbors will attack them. The war will last for another 30 years. It is, by far, the biggest geopolitical catastrophe in American history. Because, make no mistake, all the fighters in all the faction, including the Kurds, blame the Americans for this wars. The United States was the only major power in the history of the world who could proudly list more than 60 other states as allies. Romania, my country, is one of them. But now the United States is the only major power who is considered the enemy by 100 million angry Arabs, Kurds and Iranians. This is not good for the future of the USA in the Golf region.

I\u2019ll just add a little, though, about the single most glaring, brazen example of America losing a war and spinning it as a victory, or at least a \u201cdraw.\u201d That was the War of 1812. The popular mythology of 1812\u2014as purveyed on something like the History Channel, say\u2014would leave most Americans believing the whole business was a British attempt to invade and subjugate America that the plucky little republic was just lucky to survive. This is because most American t.v. documentaries about the war gloss awkwardly over the real meat of it: which was the American attempt to invade Canada. Dress it up however you like, this was an almost purely opportunistic attempt to advance \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d by carving off a piece of the British Empire while they were perceived to be busy with Napoleon. It was an utter and disastrous failure and defeat in every way, point blank. America started this war, lost it, failed in all its objectives and was sent packing, and that is as absolutely clear-cut as it gets. What allows the claim of its being a \u201cdraw\u201d to persist is that America suffered a counterattack by the justifiably infuriated British. This of course was the counter-attack that famously saw the White House burned, but the notion that Britain was otherwise about to reconquer America doesn\u2019t hold water. The objective was to punish the incursion into Canada so it wasn\u2019t repeated, and this, too, Britain was largely successful. New Orleans\u2014now much bally-hooed as a watershed in American history, a decoration on the personal myth of Andrew Jackson and proof of the republic\u2019s enduring grit and independence\u2014was in fact largely a sideshow that took place after a peace treaty had already been concluded (word of the armistice hadn\u2019t reached the commanders involved). It had some effect on the eventual terms concluded after the war but in no way did it make the whole business a \u201cdraw.\u201d America has some dubious mythology in circulation about its various wars, but it\u2019s that one that truly takes the cake.

            "answer_text": "In Vietnam, we failed to accomplish the objectives we set out to achieve. It is widely considered to have been an American defeat, and even Robert S. McNamara and Henry Kissinger have agreed that victory was beyond our reach. The Korean War ended in a stalemate. It wasn't a defeat but it wasn't a victory either. The division of Korea today stands as evidence of no conclusive victory by either side. The little known conflict known as Red Cloud\u2019s War (1866\u20131868) was actually the United States\u2019 first decisive military defeat. It is seldom regarded as such, but taken alone is was clearly a defeat for the United States military. The discovery of gold in Montana let to the establishment of the Bozeman Trail, running from Fort Laramie and heading through the traditional hunting grounds of the Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Northern Arapaho tribes. After several Indian raids, three columns of soldiers (2,675 men in total) were sent to defeat the raiders along the Powder River. All in all, the effort was soundly defeated. The largest battle, variously called the Fetterman Fight, Fetterman Massacre, or Battle of the Hundred Slain saw all 81 soldiers under the command of Captain William J. Fetterman killed by the Allied forces of the Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho tribes under the leadership of Crazy Horse. It was the worst defeat suffered by American forces until the later and more famous Battle of Little Bighorn. The war ended with the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868 in which the United States gave up all control of what is now South Dakota west of the Missouri River and created the Great Sioux Reservation. The reason that Red Cloud\u2019s War is often not considered a defeat is that the United States failed to honor its own treaty and reneged within a decade, leading to the Great Sioux War of 1876, in which the Indians were defeated. Many Americans, if they know of these conflicts at all, view them as setbacks rather than defeats. Nonetheless, the tribes of the northern plains successfully defeated the Army of the United States in open warfare, a feat that very few have ever accomplished. ",

            "answer_text": "The long forgotten War of 1812 was another conflict that, while not a clear or resounding defeat, was a wholly unsuccessful military venture for those young United States. A relatively small conflict with few major engagements out side the Battle of New Orleans, the conflict is largely overlooked by historians except in Canada where the outcome mattered greatly to the survival of British rule in North America. The causes of the war are vague and disperse: American anger at alleged Royal Navy impressment of American registered sailors and vessels on the high seas (Britain was in the midst of turmoil due the NapoleonIc Wars and the large scale boycott of Britain via the French Continental System), confusion and conflict regarding territorial sovereignty beyond the northern Ohio Valley region and the anger this caused British allied Native American groups, and a renewal of hawkish sentiment among certain members of Congress to make a final sweep of British Crown influence from America. This all led to a rather half hazard war effort on the American behalf, where a great many in Congress were against any such war, seeing it as a ludicrous waste of men, time, and treasure. To Britain it was an annoyance an entire world away from its serious issues with the wars of the French Revolution. Nevertheless the United States were able to raise a relatively sizeable force of men to invade across the Niagara River and further south from Detriot into Upper Canada (modern day Southern Ontario) and Royal Navy and US vessels engaged each other on the Lakes Eire and Ontario. To defend Upper Canada the British had a relatively sufficient number of Redcoat regulars backed up by a significant militia of local Loyalist settlers from Upper Canada. The key point was the English held a significant advantage in leadership coming from the able young General Issac Brock. The American invasion made some headway at first but was then stymied and largely reversed with British/Canadian success in the Battles of Queenston Heights near modern day Hamilton and striking across the frontier to capture Detriot and control Upper Michigan. The US Navy later won control of Lake Erie , resulting in cut off British and Native troops retreating from Detriot, suffering a losing Battle of the Thames in the process (where legendary Native leader and Crown ally Techmesh fell in fighting service to his Redcoat brothers). However any attempt to invade and conquer the Canadas was clearly beyond the scope of the US military at that present time and US forces made no further efforts to do so. The powerful Royal Navy and Marines then launched an assault along the Cheaspeke Bay region, highlighted by the sacking of Washington DC and the burning of the Capitol Building and White House (a popular urban myth was the Presidential manor was intially a more rose colour and repainted white in the reconstruction). This successful British campaign was stopped in a resolute defeat at the Battle of Baltimore. By 1814 Napleon was in chains and Britain could afford to send more seasoned forces to prosecute war against the US. However two major efforts, an invasion of New York via Lake Champlain and the much celebrated Battle of New Orleans (were a young General Andrew Jackson \u2018'made his bones\u2019 so to speak) ended in clear American victory. However stalemate reigned and the US, particularly in the highly anti-war New England, was eager to see peace and normalcy returned before more blood was shed and further money squandered. As such the two parties signed the Treaty of Ghent in Belgium in 1815. It largely reaffirmed the status quo that existed prior to the war, with the national frontiers remaining intact and Crown rule reaffirmed in the Canadas. The one major difference was the collapse of the Confederacy of Tribes under Techmesh which resulted from the war. This British sponsored confederation of Native American tribal groups posed a certain obstacle to unfettered US expansion further west of the Ohio Valley. Its demise made Manifest Destiny all the more destined you could say. But the grander objectives of the war were never even remotely possible once the Congress declared itself for war. As well the US suffered humiliations, like the torching of the White House, that would seem near science fiction by today's standards. In this way, and the near 2500 American dead for a complete return to status quo, one could arguably claim this war as a losing and failed endeavour by the United States. ",

            "answer_text": "A few, to be sure. But you'd have to be more specific into what losing entails. 1812- The war of 1812 is the first that comes to mind. Basically, Canada and Britain vs. U.S. Our White House was burned down, and even though the British were absolutely destroyed at New Orleans, I'd still call this one a loss. A peace deal was reached and both parties agreed to stop fighting. Vietnam War- This is a tricky war to discuss the win/lost argument. On one side you have the facts that; The US never lost a battleThe NVA recieved far heavier casualties.The politicians at home tied the hands of the military.Public support fell, which gutted the effort.You also have the facts that; North Vietnam achieved all their objectivesThe U.S. withdrew forces in 1973, the South fell in 1975.Communism spread to two neighboring countries.I'm in the thought group that we lost this war. It was a war of attrition for the U.S. but a war of independence for Vietnam, who had been fighting France previously for the same reason. We couldn't have won. Iraq War- I'd say we lost this one too. Similar to Vietnam, U.S. forces devastated any military target and inflicted massive casualties on the insurgency that arose. However, in my opinion none of the objectives were reached that we went in to secure. In addition, we sort of messed up the area doing so. War On Drugs- Yeah, I'm including this here too. The war on drugs was a costly, innefective venture that is still ruining lives with mandatory minimum sentences today. That's just my opinion though. Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Canadians are frequently taught the US lost the War of 1812 because they didn't conquer British North America.  However, this is a narrow perspective to have.  Truth is the US probably won the War of 1812, or at the very least, they didn't loose it.  My brother and I debate this all the time.  He thinks that because \"our side burned Washington and Canada is not an American state \" we\" won.  I think the Americans won because they achieved their war aims.   After 25 years of arguments over beers, air can say neither one us is going to budge. Americans fought the War of 1812 mainly for the following reasons: trade restrictions brought about by the British war with France; the impressment of US merchant sailors into the Royal Navy; British support for Native American tribes against European American expansion; and outrage over insults to national honor after humiliations on the high seas.   Many historians have argued that annexing Canada was a war aim.  Many US politicians and journalists, mostly in the the North East had no interest in attacking Britain in North American.  The rest were driven by the goal of expelling Britain from North America as they were tired of British interference in westward expansion.  So a strong argument can be made that annexing  Canada wasn't a war aim, it was a means of ending British interference in, the soon to be, American west was.   While the US lost several battles in 1812 and 1813, they were very successful in 1814 and ended the war on high note.  The scored major victories at sea, on the Great Lakes,and in the American South in 1814. The war ended because Britain had just concluded the Napoleonic Wars and was tired and the US was not interesting in continuing the fight. Both sides were eager for peace. No land changed hands as a result of the war.  Britain eased trade restrictions and stopped impressing American sailors.  The US pretty much ended up with a free hand in the American west.  Americans ended a war on a positive note and so they felt national honour was restored.  The only thing they did not do was annex Canada, and as noted above it is debatable if it was a real war aim. So the US clearly obtained 4 out 5 war aims (for some 4 out of 4 aims).  Britain was defending herself, but conceded everything but territory to the US.  So at worst the War of 1812 was draw for the US.  Canadians believe Britain won because Canada was not annexed and many foundational national myths were formed following the war. Readers maybe interested to know that British scholars largely ignore the war as was seen as minor theatre of operations during the Napoleonic War,  American scholars are not overly interested in the war either ( the American Revolution and the Civil War are far more exciting.  Canadians are very interested in the war as it is seen as laying the foundation for unifying Canada in 1867. ",

After the Vietnam war, many Southeast Asian countries including South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia fell under communist radar. Repressive regimes with opposing views to the West came to power and because of the U.S inability to impede the spread, it lost the war to the Soviets.  Pic Credit: American Hegemony Is Here to Stay Operation Gothic Serpent Another recent humiliating defeat the U.S experienced is the one in Somalia during the Clinton administration. In 1994, the U.S began one of the largest American military deployment since the Vietnam War in an effort to capture faction leader Aidid who stood the way of the international community in their efforts to help the millions of refugees and internally displaced people in the areas surrounding, Moqdishu, the Somali capital; however, that turned out to be a failure when the U.S forces and armed civilians loyal to Aidid engaged in street fighting which resulted the killing of hundreds of Somalis, eighteen American soldiers and the eventual retreat of all U.S military personnel from Somalia.

            "answer_text": "Without over-analyzing the differences between major and minor wars, armed interventions, and violent incidents, here is a quick run-down on the American effort in a number of wars, comparing the reality of goals to possibilities. Victories in major wars, and please note that there were major alliances involved in most of them:  The American Revolution, The Mexican-American War, the American Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, and The First Iraq War. In all of these the major strategic goals were accomplished and no crippling strategic failures occurred. Draws in major wars:  The War of 1812 and the Korean War.  Contrary to what is apparently taught in Canadian schools, the War of 1812 was fought between the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with the British colonial possessions in what is now Canada as a major battlefield. While there was a faction in the United States that wanted to resolve its issues with the British by conquering Canada, that turned out to be neither achievable or necessary. The national issue that the prompted the United States to declare war was persistent violations of American sovereignty, some of them by British officials based in Upper Canada (modern Ontario), but most by the Royal Navy harassing American shipping and, in one case attacking and seizing control of a major American naval vessel (the Chesapeake\u2013Leopard Affair) as it was leaving port and unable to defend itself. By 1815, neither side had accomplished much militarily--the burning of Washington by a British naval expedition was not a crippling defeat--and both sides agreed to call the war off. While the war itself was an effective draw, the British thereafter respected American sovereignty and the Americans thereafter respected Canadian sovereignty, which benefited both budding nations immensely. Korea was a draw because, while the defeat of the North Korean armies in the summer of 1950 guaranteed the existence of a democratic South Korea for the foreseeable future, the defeat of the United Nations forces by the Chinese in the winter of 1950 guaranteed North Korea's survival and an effectively permanent state of armed truce on the peninsula still in effect 66 years later. Losses in major wars:  Vietnam, the Afghanistan Invasion, and the Second Iraq War. In none of these wars did the Americans ever lose a major ground battle, but, beyond the devastation inflicted on the countries involved, all three were strategic disasters of the first order. The Americans failed in all three cases to support or create governments stable enough to dominate the the national territory, and so all three wars dragged on for years, consuming American resources, demoralizing and inflicting misery on the local population, and leaving the successor governments strategically with the Americans vulnerable to internal and external attack. At the same time, all three wars crippled America's reputation as a \"peaceful\"--or at least non-imperialist--power that most American administrations had tried to build up over the last two centuries.  Among minor wars, the Filipino-American War is minor only because it was considered an \"internal\" war by the international community. The loss of life on the Filipino side was horrific, and the leading American imperialist of the era, Theodore Roosevelt, quickly ordered a peaceful resolution once he fully comprehended the extent of it. This war can best be considered a draw. Balanced against the terrible loss of life is the fact that the Filipinos gained domestic sovereignty through their resistance. The Americans kept the Europeans and Japanese imperialists out of the Philippines--at least until 1941--and agreed to a timetable for full Filipino independence.   The American Indian Wars were also considered internal affairs by the United States and the international community and most involved only a few dozen or a hundred or two hundred deaths. Most were military victories for the American army, although some can be considered draws and almost all of them were ended by negotiation to avoid the annihilation of the tribes involved.  Other armed interventions sometimes ended in military defeats (as with the Reagan Era intervention in Lebanon) but did not rise to the level of strategic defeats or \"lost wars\" as most historians would define them.

(i.e. Vietnam) & (Korea) - A truce and capitulation is a war lost - not won: We prefer not to admit. We didn\u2019t win either of those wars - because the collateral damage body count and the economics could not sustain territorial holdings by force without invading other nations sovereign territory who were attempting to repatriate and end years of exploitative colonial occupation for personal gain and not the nation\u2019s people. . WE won the Revolutionary War because the British cost to fight it was TOO expensive, and they tried to recapture their foot print in colonial territory in 1812\u2026 AND, as noted, we were trying to invade Canada to colonize it into U.S. Territory: While expanding and pushing North American indigenous Tribes into confined territory or reduce the ability to sustain they had to surrender or be wiped out (Genocide). We didn\u2019t win WW1 or WW2 - we only added bodies to help allies and to protect access to resources and trade. The British Empire or other European western nations didn\u2019t win it either. By this, I mean, without Russian\u2026 Germany was succeeding to win the war. BUT, ran out of gas, were going broke, being led my a narcissistic nut saying he was going to make \u201cGermany Great Again\u201d and the animals around him looking to profit off the war spoils - and They went about killing off any of the competitive ethnic groups that rebuilt the Germany economy after WW1 went bankrupt. Hitler than nationalized control with a dictators desire\u2026 ambition. He became delusional and a tyrant ruler. Hum? Sure glad there is no National leader like that in the U.S. as nutty and as very uneducated as the funny Mustache guy - or the Fascist Benito Mussolini arrogant idiot be ever elected POTUS - right? Nah\u2026 That could never happen such a person of such character as those guys be given and granted such political power or a group back him and grab the spoils of exploiting the masses to gain self-wealth and greater power\u2026 right? We\u2019re a United Nation State of We the People are smarter than that - right? We were doing great in 2016, and then\u2026 WTF!!! We went to war with ourselves as one would like us be divided not united he had not the talent nor leadership skills but a fake conman with one ambition - fame and fortune at the expense of a nation no We the people - just a me his self-worship. But, he\u2019s lost the battle and loosing the war\u2026 he we be forced to surrender his crown and perhaps, escape into exile or be tried for war crimes against the nation. We will soon see if we the people lose the war or win it against the mind of a despot. ",

            "answer_text": "Red Cloud's War 1866\u20131868 fought along the Bozeman Road in present day Wyoming, and Montana. Many skirmishes with one stand-out: the Fetterman Battle December 21, 1866, outside Fort Phil Kearny, just north of present day Buffalo, Wyoming along I-90. Captain Fetterman and all infantry, cavalry, and citizen soldiers were rubbed-out by some of the same warriors who would defeat Custer at the Little Bighorn 10 years later. When all the fighting was finished, the U.S. Government established and ratified the Treaty of 1868 (Ft. Laramie Treaty) in which the U.S. agreed to abandon all its forts built to house troops who were there to protect those traveling along the Bozeman. Red Cloud pressured the U.S. to abandon all the forts BEFORE he would sign the Treaty, so President Grant approved the closing of Forts C.F. Smith, Kearny, and Reno. Most important, this treaty established the Great Sioux Reservation in present day South Dakota west of the Missouri River, including the Black Hills. Spotted Tail's people were granted the area south of the South Platte along the Republican River in Kansas and Nebraska. Also set aside was the \u201cunceeded Indian territory\u201d, which included Wyoming west to the Bighorn Mountains, and south to the North Platte. This territory was for the Lakota to use for summer excursions to hunt, practice their religion (Sun Dance), weddings, and replenish materials. No white man could live, let alone travel, through these regions without permission of the Lakota. Everything changes six years later when a scientific expedition was approved by Grant to explore the Black Hills. The U.S. was suffering a major economic depression, so the underlying and secret factor to this expedition was to prove if the rumors of gold were true. Leading this expedition of 1000 soldiers, civilians, and Indian scouts would be none other than Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer and his 7th Cavalry. Gold was indeed discovered along French Creek just outside of present-day Custer City, South Dakota. The rest is history. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if I would characterize it this way. If France had not intervened during the American Revolution the British would have prevailed. The British won all but about two of the battles against the Americans in the War of 1812. The Treaty of Ghent was signed after Napoleon was exiled. The reasons for the war went away. Therefore, this was more of a draw. All the wars up until Korea were victories for the US. Both sides signed a cease fire agreement in Korea. Technically the war hasn\u2019t ended. The Treaty of Paris was signed ending Vietnam. It\u2019s said that the US lost this war. However, the US didn\u2019t surrender to Vietnam. Therefore, this war doesn\u2019t count as a \u201closs.\u201d The same could be said of Afghanistan. The Gulf War was a victory for the US and coalition partners. Operation Iraqis Freedom resulted in many American casualties but again this was not an American loss or a loss for America\u2019s Allies. The reasons for American intervention were flawed in this last example. There was the belief that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. This turned out to not be the case. In the US there was the belief that if Vietnam fell to communism so would the rest of Southeast Asia; this was known as the Domino Theory. This also proved to not be the case. However, in all reality, the US has never \u201clost\u201d a war in the conventional sense. ",

            "answer_text": "The Geographical location of the United States ensures that theyve never had to surrender in war, though they havent really fought many wars alone. Theyre surrounded by various weak and corruptable countries in central and southern america, of which the US has always generally had some sort of technological advantage over, therefore theyve never had to fight wars on home territory against equal opposition. (The wars against Mexico was before current day US establishment) Theyre specialists at \u2018Force Projection\u2019- ensuring they always have the mobility and logistics with which to relocate men and materi\u00e9l to particular areas, usually inside Europe or the Middle East. The United States hasnt fought many- if any- one on one, US vs said country away from the US mainland. Korea was an international effort and against Japan in WW2 was a series of amphibious assaults and island hopping without full blown armies thrashing it out. The US also has the distinct advantage of choosing wars- it doesnt get sucked into wars through treaties, (NATO aside) or through territorial disputes. It can pick a country, deploy an expeditionary force and sit back and decide either to invest more men and money or pull back and leave the \u201cNatives\u201d or \u201cUS- trained security forces\u201d to fight a rearguard action until theyre safely away after which they get defeated. That is how the US fights wars- with the Stars and Stripes on their sleeves against weak opposition or with an Allied banner against a worthy foe. Pretty damn intelligent modus operandi ",

Korea was a stalemate yes, but it wasnt due because we lost battles. in Vietnam, we crushed the enemy yet was eventually called off because politicians didnt know what to do and changed there mind like underwear. we did in 3 days what russia couldnt do in 20 years in afghanistan (I know I was there) We could been home lees than a week from Afghanistan (read an operation called bora bora) again politicians. Iraq again crushed the enemy twice (so why are we still in iraq?) Lets just say we never had to sign a cease fire or treaty that wasnt on our terms. as for direct conflict no we have never lost (Even the romans couldnt claim this, but to be fair we still have a thousand years to go). We get side bared with united nation conflicts (korea, vietnam, somalia, iraq) they tell us we lost those wars yet we have never retreated or fell from defeat. the closest we actually ever came to losing was the war of 1812. And the civil war was just a big mistake we could have done things a lot different without actually having a civil war. ",

The people of the United States of America, through their elected government, engaged in war to support South Vietnam. Despite many military victories, and losing less troops, they eventually gave up on their ally and left. North Vietnam received the unwavering support of China and the Soviet Union, and won. Although the US military technically did not get defeated, it could also not defeat the enemy. At no point the North cried uncle and asked for peace. At no point did the US dare invade the North and neutralize them. At this juncture, more or less the same happens in Afghanistan. The US can blast anything into oblivion, but cannot control what goes on much beyond the perimeter of its bases. Another consideration is if the country is better off after the war than the enemy. If you look at modern Germany and Japan, with higher standards of living, better healthcare, better safety nets and safer lives for their average citizen, you could argue they are ultimately the winners.

What exactly could anyone say about the Middle East, except that things are far worse now than they were before the US went in. You have lost hundreds of thousands of troops to injury and death and what have you achieved? Certainly not peace and prosperity.Even the Cold War which seemed to be settling after Reagan and Gorbachev is now heating up again under Trump. ",

I don\u2019t know what. I\u2019d call it a loss. It\u2019s certainly not a win, and not winning a fight you started is basically a loss.

Sure it\u2019s not a war in the conventional sense but that\u2019s what the US calls it\u2019s actions and that\u2019s how they treat it, like a war. There\u2019s no good news that ever came out of this \u201c\u201cwar.\u201d It\u2019s been a disaster from the first day and it continues to be a complete disaster. Thousands have died and millions imprisoned, and to what end? Drug use remains the same. No victory in sight for this war. Other nations that have taken this approach have failed as well. ",

The obvious answer would be the Vietnam War, however it is worth noting that when the Tet Offensive occured, the North Vietnamese thought of it as a failure and although the outcome was precisely the the wrong one as far as the US was concerned, America had largely withdrawn from the region. Red Cloud's War is considered to be a defeat by the US, however this was just as much about real cost based effectiveness as it was about victories, so not too much can be drawn from this conflict.  Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War did involve the US and as such, it can be loosely classed as a defeat.  The War of 1812 is considered to be a stalemate and as such, I'm not sure that counts as a defeat and the Utah War ended in a resolution and probably doesn't count as a defeat. The Second Samoan Civil War is classed as a comprise, but it appears to have largely achieved it's goals and as such, is arguably better classed as a victory. ",

Without French assistance plus the tyranny of distance making it difficult for the Brits put up a better fight, who knows how it may have turned out. Wasn't there also some ill-judged attack on Canada? How did that go? I am not familiar with the details but was there an ill-fated war in China? Although not technically wars, how about the \u2018war on drugs'? How many rebel groups did the US support and how many times have American arms ended up being used on Americans? You guys seem to have an unnerring ability to pick the wrong groups to support. Supporting the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan was a classic example.

Since WWII there haven't been many declared wars; they were instead police actions, interventions, undeclared, or something else. The War of 1812 was a draw with things remaining pretty much status quo ante bellum. The Korean War technically has never ended and the country is divided into two parts, so I would consider that a draw as well. You could argue Vietnam either as a win or a loss; I personally consider it a loss. The invasion of Iraq in 2001 is too recent to assess and unclear what the long-term prospective survival is for the current regime. Afghanistan is an ongoing operation so no telling what will happen there, ditto with ISIS/Dash, and the War on Terror. ",

The first between North Korea and the UN (mostly the US) ended in victory for the UN when North Korean forces were crushed and forced out of South Korea in 1950.  The second phase of the war started with what was probably the worst military mistake ever made by the US, the invasion of North Korea. This ill conceived move brought UN (again mostly US) forces near the border of China and North Korea in Late October 1950, right when the possibility of air support was compromised by the onset of winter. The Chinese intervened as they had warned and pushed the UN forces back into South Korea before their advance was halted.  Subsequent counter attacks by UN forces pushed the Chinese forces to a front around the 38th parallel, the dividing line between North and South Korea. There stalemate set it for 2 blood years while negotiations moved at a snale's pace at Panmunjom.  In my view, the first phase of the war was a victory for the UN since North Korean forces were pushed out of South Korea, the second phase of the war was a UN (and US) defeat because UN forces were push out of North Korea by Chinese forces.

Contrary to what everyone is taught or believes, the United States gained none of the changes in British policy it set out to win, it failed to achieve its military objectives, which was to take or steal parts of Canada from the British and the war resulted in thousands of unnecessary deaths and many hard feelings that began the separation of the country that would lead to the almost complete genocide of the Native Americans and ultimately, the Civil War. And that is exactly the next war we lost. There were no winners in the Civil War, just 600,000+ dead Americans. Then we can move on to the Korean War which wasn\u2019t even called a war until many years later, as it was referred to as a \u201cpolice action\u201d by Truman.

In response to the answers that claim no military defeat, we must look further. The US military is tasked with meeting the political goals of the civilian leadership through use of force.

For some reason or another they never actually went before congress and declared war in north Vietnam. Our mission was to protect the south and in all honesty fighting it like a border dispute was wrong. We needed to declare war, land marines in the north; and royally fuck them over. It was a mission where we couldn't go after the nva because of the rules of engagement and they always lived to fight another day once they disengaged. Our leadership was terrible and I believe we lost more men by calling it a conflict than we would have if we attacked the north at home and killed them.  In Korea we actually accomplished our goal. The north had almost conquered the south and we pushed them all the way up to the northern most border with China. Chinese volunteered flooded the border and we were pushed back to basically the old border at Seoul, which was what we needed to reach in the first place. The mission was to protect South Korea and we succeeded. On a good day you could call it a technical win, on a bad day it was a draw.  ",

I know that Vietnam is widely considered a loss for us, but militarily, it never lost the war. our losses were 1/20th of their losses, with the only reason we left being due to civil unrest, as mentioned above. the South Vietnamese lost the war, we didn\u2019t. we became neutral to the issue as soon as the last boots stepped on US soil, we had declared the war a success, and signed a treaty ending it. a second war began after, and us being neutral to it meant that the South fell, almost unopposed.

I was interested in the posts (and other conversations that I\u2019ve gotten into in the past) that get into the technicalities of why the United States didn\u2019t lose there - it didn\u2019t surrender, it wasn\u2019t conquered, etc, etc. This is just national pride talking. So, let\u2019s take another example. The Soviet Union-Afghan war that latest from 1979 to 1989. According to Wikipedia, the Soviets and their allies lost about 100,000 men (killed and wounded) while the Mujahideen lost 150,000 to 175,000. So the Soviets killed more Afghans, didn\u2019t surrender and just withdrew. Did they win the war? Of course they didn\u2019t. And the United States didn\u2019t win the War in Vietnam, the lost it, just like the Soviets. Now, only being on the losing side of one war, with one draw (War of 1812) and all the rest victories is pretty impressive and no other country can claim this kind of record. So, it is OK to be proud of that fact - do you really need to say you\u2019ve won them all? ",

Other Quorans night have a more definitive answer. IMO, however, the United States has never been soundly defeated in a war, as in LOST. There have been occasions (Vietnam) where for political reasons we did not have support to make an all-out effort. There have been occasions where we thought better of the situation and just said, \u201cFuck it!\u201d and walked away. I contend that quitting an unproductive conflict is not the same as \u201closing the war\u201d. Some may disagree. I would not recommend to any nation, however, that they attempt to be the first. At the end of WW II we had the military capability and political will to crush Japan by application of conventional military forces and tactics. We could have invaded Japan and we would have defeated them there as we had everywhere else. But we looked at the time and cost and casualties and decided to just nuke them instead.

            "answer_text": "To a certain extent, it depends on your perspective. To the extent that conquering Canada was a war objective in the War of 1812, the United States was unsuccessful. However, it did meet its goal of getting the British Empire to treat with it as an equal. After the war, the British respected U.S. shipping and negotiated all future treaties on an equitable basis (the 1795 Jay Treaty was decidedly in Britain\u2019s favor). The War of 1812 is often referred to as the \u201cSecond American War of Independence\u201d for this reason. I would argue that the United States lost its own Civil War, because the simple fact that it had to be fought was a collective failure on the part of the entire country, and it cost hundreds of thousands of lives and a lot of money. But I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not what you mean. The only other case for a lost war would be Vietnam, which is a subject I\u2019ve discussed before: John Cate's answer to Do you believe the United States won the Vietnam War? Every other war (and by \u201cwar\u201d I mean real wars, not overblown police actions) fought by the United States was one in which its primary objectives were achieved. ",

At the top of the list of the things the Vietnamese were fighting for was to get our guys out of their country, and be left free to make their own choices regarding how to govern themselves (whether free market, socialism in whatever form, or whatever mix in between), and who should govern them. By the time we were ready to sign the cease-fire in 1973, we could hardly wait to get our guys out of there, and leave the \u201cnon-Communist\u201d, \u201cdemocratic\u201d, but still badly corrupt and unpopular and anything-but-democratic government that we ourselves had set up back in the 50s, and had been over there fighting unsuccessfully to support, on its own \u2014 which was exactly what our adversaries wanted and had been fighting for. I don\u2019t mean to sound unpatriotic or denigrate the efforts or sacrifices of our guys who served, but I can\u2019t exactly call that a win for us.

The United States thus withdrew their support for the south, who then wasn't able to hold back the communists, and lost control over the country.

            "answer_text": "Vietnam is generally considered a US defeat but by many measures it was anything but. If stats I've seen are even nearly accurate the NVA and Viet Cong fatalities inflicted by US forces was approximately 3 million while US deaths were in excess of 50 thousand. That's a ratio of 60:1. Of course that doesn't consider the far greater suffering by the far greater number of wounded on both sides as well as Vietnamese civilian casualties. There is a great series on the war shown from time to time on History Channel which interviews officials and military leaders of the time who believed US was only months away from being able to force a surrender, but chose instead to pull out after public opinion reached a boiling point after the Tet Offensive. It's almost like we weren't fired but resigned. But no one will ever know for sure. What is certain now is that it was a complete waste of millions of lives and untold suffering for a bogus cause where a superpower was embarrassed by a very tough, determined, smart,experienced, well-lead and well-armed foe fighting yet another overconfident power on it's own turf.

            "answer_text": "Yes.  Technically, the War of 1812 was a draw.  However, the young United States had planned to annex Canada and failed, so that can be called a loss. The Union defeated the Confederacy in a bloody war that cost over 500,000 lives.  Though the US was divided and technically the Union side was the US, it can be called a loss due to the utter devastation of casualties. Korea was a draw, but it demonstrated that the US could not always achieve its objectives using force. Vietnam was a huge loss as not only did Vietnam go Communist, but so did Laos and Cambodia--largely thanks to brain-dead US intervention that backfired. The Iraq War was a total fiasco and so is Afghanistan--or so it would appear. ",

We spent something like 60,000 lives, hundreds of thousands of wounded, and untold billions of dollars, to do that.   That wasn't done. When the dust settled, South Vietnam no longer existed, and had been taken over by the communists.  That's a clear cut loss by any objective criterion. All other wars either ended in clear cut victories, or at least a muddled peace that could get spun into a victory.  But far as an unmitigated defeat?  Vietnam's the only one. ",

We lost that, where we accomplished little, and pulled out the moment we lost a few men, there was no victory there. Of course was that really a war? Hard to make that claim. Full blown wars, I would say no. Contrary to some of the other commenters, we didn\u2019t lose Vietnam. We left. We could have easily stomped North Vienam flat. We never attacked. Then we left. You can\u2019t really \u2018lose\u2019 when you never attack the enemy. Those people are simply just wrong. 100% wrong. ",

The outcome of these, as you can see in this thread, can be argued almost endlessly. Not officially losses given a surrender didn't take place, but certainly not victories either given a lasting outcome was not achieved. Territory gains made in the name of an Empire tend to make things much clearer with regards to wins and losses! ",

Saying that is very misleading, South Vietnam was taken years after the US had withdrawn its last troops from the country, and by 1975 Vietnam was receiving limited funding from the US. While the Americans were there, our guys didn't give up any significant ground or lose any major battles. Our objective was to maintain the status quo borders and that is exactly what we did until we withdrew. It's very debatable, its like you are a quarterback and you put your team in the lead by 2 touchdowns, however at half time you left because you didn't feel like playing and the other team ends up winning. Does that really reflect on your incompetence as a quarterback, or your teammates lack of skill? ",

The cold war was a war without guns yet the United States did not truly win that because once the iron curtain fell it caused a massive rift in the Eastern European area and has continued to cause problem. The area has not stabilized. So in wrapping this up, one can not in modern times (meaning from the Korean war on) declare a winner nor loser in conflict. ",

The British captured Washington, DC. Instead of occupying Washington, they burned it to the ground and then retreated. They had no desire to reclaim the USA; their greater concern was the Napoleonic War. The objective of the war was to annex Canada. Obviously, it did not succeed. I learned in elementary school the revisionist contention that we won based upon the British ceasing the impressment of American sailors. Undoubtedly, there had been isolated incidents of impressment but the British admiralty had ordered that the practice cease before the war began. Others have argued that the war was a draw because there was no change in land borders. It was no more a draw than the 1st Gulf War which had the same result as the USA saw no value in occupation (at that time). ",

The stated objective of the communist leadership was to hit and run against the French because the Vietnamese were highly adaptable to disappearing into triple canopy jungle or mixing back in to the population. They had experience against the Japanese who invaded Indochina, and thousands of years of off and on Chinese occupation. The same is true continuing on with the Americans. Ho Chi Minh was educated in France and was a Pastry Chef at one time in Boston, Massachusetts. He was familiar with Western attitudes, just like American educated Qutb who helped to establish the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt whose student was one Osama bin Laden at one time. Know thy enemy. The North Vietnamese felt that if they could hit and run, cause casualties in wounds and deaths, the western populations in the war would eventually grow weary. They did fight set piece battles at the places of their time and choosing. American leadership was afraid China would invade like they did in Korea so attempted limited war and the enemy enjoyed those benefits. The Soviet Disinformation Service most likely played a role in Public Relations at key areas in the US. They were very active during the Cold War. In the end the Communist tactics achieved victory.

Jen MooresApr 26, 2017 \u00b7 2 upvotes That's the same argument the Germans used that led to ww2. so are you sayinig the Germans won Ww 1 ,they wear winning the war . america lost Vietnam because like the Germans they lost the war at home .there is more to winning a war than winning battles look at the war of independence America lost battles to the British .military Britain won but we lost why because we lost the war at home. This person clearly does not know history. Germany didn\u2019t lose the war at home, they lost it on the battlefield, with the War ending with Soviet and Allied soldiers occupying their country and impregnating their women. Their country was destroyed and their industry and independence, were gone. As far as military battles in the American Revolution, Britain, unlike the USA in Vietnam, didn\u2019t win every battle. It was a military defeat for Britain. I understand that Colonial America had help from France and Spain, but regardless, it was a military defeat. The US seems to fare well on the battlefield, but never really wins the peace. If the US forces were still in South Vietnam, that country would still exist. No nation is going to push the US \u201cinto the sea\u201d. Only people that like to dislike the United States would be so blind to the reality that the Vietnam \u201closs\u201d, was a strategic loss and not a military one. South Vietnam was militarily defeated, not the US. Facts are what they are\u2026our combat forces left in 1973, and South Vietnam fell in 1975. South Korea would have suffered the same fate if US combat forces left the peninsula. We didn\u2019t leave and South Korea is still in existence. ",

The Korean War: The Chinese counterattack did push back NATO, but the original invasion of South Korea was repulsed. Vietnam: I don't believe this was necessarily a lost war. The US was winning, but the casualties were very high. Over 50,000 Americans lost their lives in the war, and the public viewed that as unacceptable. Thus, we pulled out. However, millions of North Vietnamese soldiers were killed, and it is unlikely that they would be able to beat the US if the war continued. ",

Peace Treaty has no mention of reason for going to war. Had to use the Royal Navy to return to the States with the peace treaty. Had the Louisiana loan two years back pay rolled over and a new one to get out of bankruptcy and pay their Army from the British. This is sometimes cited a by the more ill informed Americans as a proven war winning strategy. Over time I am resigned to the fact that Americans don\u2019t face facts on this silly war. What I find unfortunate is that they have no knowledge of the 1803 treaty of Amiens, the 1815 Treaty of Ghent and worst of all why the horrendous casualties incurred by Wellingtons Army in storming and capturing Ciaudad Rodrigo and Badahoz not only brought about the downfall of Napoleon but ensured America\u2019s defeat in the war of 1812 but also the burning of Washington government buildings and the Bladensburg Races.

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of good answers already. I want to point out a less obvious loss. World War II began with the Nazi conquest of Poland and Czechoslovakia. The USA didn\u2019t immediately enter the war when those countries were taken but the liberation of these countries was a major goal for the allies. After WWII, all of Eastern Europe, half of Germany, and a big chunk of Finland was under the control of a different hostile power, the Soviet Union. We had successfully liberated only a portion of Europe. The Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal) remained under Fascist control although they were friendly to the West.  At best, the European part of WWII has to be regarded as a stalemate that persisted into the late 20th Century when the Soviet Union finally collapsed. ",

Politicians and arrogant generals thought they could successfully invade Canada while the Brits were busy fighting Napoleon. They were wrong The invasion of Canada failed miserably and resulted in a huge counter offensive. American sailors were being captured and ports were blockaded. Probably the biggest blow was when the British came to D.C and burned the old White House and a few other important buildings down. The president and his cabinet had to flee for their lives. The only major battle we won was a phyrric victory in New Orleans after the peace treaty was already signed. So the country was now bankrupt and had its capital occupied, meanwhile states were threatening to secede. Truly a humiliating and idiotic affair. ",

The US, having superior modern weaponry, won almost all the battles and inflicted disproportionately massive casualties on the North Vietnamese Army.  But the US couldn't eradicate NVA resistance completely, the NVA just kept on coming and fighting and did win several notable battles. This fact, together with the anti-war movement in America, and international diplomatic and political situation at the time forced the US to withdraw troops from Vietnam in 1973.  Two years later in spring 1975, the NVA launched a full-scale offensive in the South. The South Vietnamese Army, deprived of American firepower support, soon collapsed. After the 55-day offensive, North achieved the ultimate victory on April 30, 1975. The US won the battles but the NVA won the war. ",

That is the principal worry concerning any involvement with Iran in an armed conflict. Whether there will be a, \u201cHanoi Jane,\u201d is a matter of debate. What is for certain is that there will be a large percentage of the American people and politicians that will vocally oppose American efforts to win such a conflict. Because there will probably be no formal declaration of war, thereby allowing the government to crack down on pro-Iranian sympathizers , we can expect the same level of internal discord designed to defeat American goals.

The US wanted to conquer in Canada in the War of 1812, it didn\u2019t, but many argue that doesn\u2019t meet the threshold of losing. Ditto for suppressing the opposition to a point in South Vietnam / Iraq / Afghanistan to make the US-supported government viable. Ditto for pushing the PLA back accross the Yalu River. The US also pulls a Pluto in many cases. Couldn\u2019t tip the scales in the Russian Civil War. Couldn\u2019t beat Sandino. Couldn\u2019t hang on to Cuba. But these military conflicts are deemed too small to be called wars. ",

The groups that benefited the most from Johnson\u2019s programs (Medicare and Medicaid especially) were the elderly and those under 18 years old, while the poverty rate among those ages 18-64 years has basically remained the same. At an investment of $15 trillion, the return has been low and the achievements modest. For the very little gain, it has been catastrophic to the national budget.
