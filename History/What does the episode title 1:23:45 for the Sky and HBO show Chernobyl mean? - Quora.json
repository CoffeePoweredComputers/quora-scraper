            "answer_text": "1:23:45 is simply the time in hours, minues and seconds that reactor number 4 exploded in the morning of April 26th 1986. Five seconds prior on 1:23:40 the shift supervisor of reactor number 4 Alexander Fyodorovich Akimov activated the AZ-5 SCRAM button which inserted the control rods into the reactor, causing an unintentional massive spike in reactivity which lead to the explosion. Edit: If I am not mistaken it is also the approximate time that Valery Alexeyevich Legasov killed himself two years after the accident, according to the show. ",
