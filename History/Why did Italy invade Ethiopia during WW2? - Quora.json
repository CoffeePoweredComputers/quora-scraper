            "answer_text": "The (Painful) Historical Context: In 1896, February 28, the Italian General Baratieri commanded the strongest European expeditionary force that Africa had ever known: 16,000 men & 52 guns. In 1896, March 1, the strongest European expeditionary force that Africa had ever known had been defeated: 262 Italian officers were killed, along with 4,000 infantry. 1,900 Italians were taken prisoner. It was the greatest single military disaster in European colonial history \u2026 waiting to be avenged. The Longer Answer: In 1932, Mussolini began contemplating the invasion of Ethiopia. Why? In Military Terms: To the south was Italian Somaliland; to the north was Italian Eritrea. In purely military terms, Ethiopia was a country at risk - much like Czechoslovakia in 1938. In Social-Psychological Terms: To demonstrate the current strength of Fascist Italy to revenge historical defeats, & therefore, to move forward to create belief in future victories - i.e. in the forthcoming Spanish Civil War. In International Political Terms: To demonstrate to the European Powers that Italy was a \u201cMajor Power,\u201d with the ability to \u201cacquire colonies,\u201d which was the geo-political accomplishment of the major European colonial powers throughout the Nineteenth Century. In Internal Political Terms: To demonstrate to the Italian population & to the Italian political & economic elites that Fascist Italy was an effective political-military power that was worthy of their support, their recognition, & their admiration. Most historians agree that Mussolini\u2019s support was at its pinnacle when he declared that the conquest of Ethiopia was the \u201cre-constitution\u201d of the Roman Empire, which he declared on May 9th, 1936: ~ \"Italy at last has her Empire \u2014 that Fascist Empire which bears the imperishable signs of truth and the power of Rome's emblem. It is an Empire of peace, because Italy wants peace for herself and for all.\u201d Unless you were an Ethiopian \u2026 Conclusion: Fascist Italy invaded Ethiopia because: it had the psychological-social motivation to win support from the Italian population (the revenge for the humiliating defeat at Adowa, 1896);it also had the political-military means to accomplish the invasion (following the \u201ctradition\u201d of European powers subjugating African nations), as well as the modern methods of warfare that almost instantly secured ultimate success (armoured units, aircraft, poison gas);it also had the determination to demonstrate that Italy was a military-economic force to be reckoned with, in the un-folding future of Europe, against the democratic, \u201cplutocratic\u201d powers of Britain & France \u2026 with the power of the US approaching on the horizon.Recommended Reading: Mockler, Anthony.

            "answer_text": "First of all the invasion was in 1935 and WWII officially started in 1939. However the more you study this conflict the more you'll come to the conclusion that it should be included in the WWII narrative. For one it was the first country \u201cliberated\" by the \u201callies\" during WWII. Furthermore contrary to other quora answers, truth is the invasion by Italy was decided back in 1933 by Mussolini himself. The border clash was an excuse to execute the invasion. That being said, according to transcripts of conversations between Mussolini and the US ambassador to Italy, the reason for the invasion was Italy felt disrespected. How you might ask, well every March Ethiopia celebrates the victory of Adwa, it's a national holiday. This is according to Benito Mussolini himself. On March 1, 1896 Ethiopia defeated Italy and Adwa was the location of the final battle. So that's the real reason for the invasion. Benito Mussolini saw this national holiday as a sign of disrespect towards Italians. P.S. An interesting side note is the fact that Italy spent 19.6 billion Liras a year fighting in Ethiopia from 1935-1940, while spending 18 billion Liras a year on Italy itself. This bankrupted Italy and is a major reason for Italy's less than impressive results during WWII. They simply couldn't afford to supply their troops with the equipment needed to defeat the Brits.  ",
