            "answer_text": "The rejection reported by Reuters is quite expected actually: Baku has initiated it and won\u2019t back-off if it now has Turkey\u2019s active support and needs to at least have some substantial conquests to show for; otherwise, their reported heavy losses will only worsen the domestic view of the Aliyev regime, a significant reason why this war was started (to avert declining domestic support and increased criticism). Armenia, on the other had, has reportedly lost some positions and will definitely try to recapture them for both political reasons but more significantly from military-strategic reason. Although, that would be quite irrelevant as long as Azerbaijan continues the offensive and the shelling. The Armenian side will simply not put down the arms and unilaterally declare ceasefire, especially since they did not start the war in the first place. As for the timing, I tried to explain it in another thread: Vahagn Avedian's answer to Which side broke the de facto ceasefire (or escalated tensions) recently at Karabakh, Armenia or Azerbaijan? Why now? In short, the domestic socioeconomic and political decline in Azerbaijan, especially in the shadow of the 2018 \u201cVelvet Revolution\u201d in Armenia, has put a lot of pressure on the Aliyev regime. It is quite safe to say that the wars in July and now in September were highly expected and most of the analysts knew that a rupture will happen. That Turkey would intervene in such flagrant manner and deploy jihadists to start another proxy war as they have in Libya and Syria was, however, a bit unexpected. It all boils down to how Russia will handle the situation, given the CSTO membership duties etc. in case Armenia would choose to invoke them. ",

            "answer_text": "This is happening now because Azerbaijan is tired of the status quo in the NKR. It will no longer be ok with the stalled negotiations and the occupation. A full blown war between both sides. It would bring regional powers into a proxy situation and will bring far away countries. What's really dangerous about this conflict that I find interesting no one in the media or Quora picked up is the fact that no major power as leverage over Armenia and Azerbaijan. The USA is not active in that side of the region with the exception of Georgia and even if they were, the Trump Administration would not do anything. No nation in Europe has serious leverage as they rather be friends with the Azeries (Reliable partner to reduce reliance on Russian gas) Russia supplies arms to both sides and cannot risk alienating the other meaning they will just call a ceasefire. China has no influence here either.This is what makes this conflict very dangerous, no one can really do anything to get them to stop and even more nations have a reason to supply the conflict. ",
