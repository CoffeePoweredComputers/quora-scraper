            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: Im assuming that the question is asking at one point the firearm stops being classified as a rifle, handgun or machine gun and starts to be classified as a cannon, and not why some direct fire artillery pieces are called guns. It is pretty much the caliber and the mobility of the weapon. More often than not, anything above .50 calibers, or 12.7 mms, is considered a cannon. This holds especially true for standard, modern military weaponry. However, things get a bit hazy when the weapon in question uses rarer ammunition, or predates the standardization of modern ammunition. For example the .700 Nitro round is used by guns, despite being 17.8 mms in diameter; however the MG 151 of the Second World War Luftwaffe was an autocannon, despite using 15 mm ammunition -significantly smaller than the .700 Nitro. And things get a bit more difficult when you discover that the KPV HMG of the USSR uses 14.5 mm ammunition, and is considered a gun, not a cannon. This problem pretty much only exists in weapons using ammunition diameters between 12.7 mm and 20 mm; anything that uses higher than 20mms is almost always a cannon, and lower than 12.7 mms is a gun. When it comes to between these two diameters, two things can more often than not determine whether if it is a gun or a cannon; mobility and intended use. If the weapon requires at least multiple people to operate, if it is too heavy to be transported by people alone, and if its main purpose is to kill via shrapnel/concussion or to destroy obstacles, then it is a cannon. If it can be operated by a single person when necessary, if it can be transported by manpower alone, and if it relies on direct hits to kill, then it is a gun. Now, since we built up a system, let's introduce some exceptions: anti-material rifles; they can be operated by a single person and can be transported by man alone, but they're main purpose is to destroy obstacles or achieve kills by penetrating armor and/or using explosive or shrapnel rounds. Heavy machine guns; they can be operated by a single person, and rely on direct hits, however they can be really, well, heavy, to the degree where you can't really transport it without at least carriages or some form of motorized vehicle; while modern iterations mostly stay between 15\u201330 kg, WWI machine guns could weigh up to 70kgs, notably the German Maxim copy, MG08 with the armor plating. The trouble with trying to use the ammunition to decide whether if something's a gun or a cannon is, well, a lot of weapons can fire a lot of different types of ammunition; it is not that hard to manufacture HE, incendiary or AP sabot round for any caliber. As such, the same weapon could at the same time both be a cannon and a gun, leading to even bigger ambiguity. Tl; DR: If it is meant to kill by shrapnel or destroy obstacles/vehicles, it's a cannon. If it's meant to be used against infantry with direct hits, it's a machine gun. One great example outlining the difference is these two:  The Vickers Medium Machine Gun  The Qf 1 pounder Pom-Pom Both are Maxim designs. Both are water-cooled. Both are quite hard to move. The difference though comes with the function; the Vickers is (or rather was) used against infantry, whereas the Pom-Pom\u2019s main use was against aircraft, along with some limited use as a light artillery piece in indirect fire.

            "answer_text": "All cannon are guns, but not all guns are cannon. This is canon. Also canon, at least in the military, is that small arms are not referred to as \u201cguns.\u201d Let\u2019s start by answering the question you didn\u2019t ask: What is the difference between small arms and guns? In the U.S. military, small arms are \"man portable, individual, and crew-served weapon systems used mainly against personnel and lightly armored or unarmored equipment\". However, in regard to inventory management, the U.S. Army says small arms/light weapons (SA/LW) are: \"Handguns, shoulder-fired weapons, light automatic weapons up to and including 12.7mm machine guns, recoilless rifles up to and including 106mm, mortars up to and including 81mm, man-portable rocket launchers, rifle-/shoulder-fired grenade launchers, and individually operated weapons that are portable or can be fired without special mounts or firing devices and that have potential use in civil disturbances and are vulnerable to theft.[1] So \u201cguns\u201d refers to barreled weapons that don\u2019t meet the qualifications for small arms as listed above. Machine guns, especially heavy machine guns, bridge the gap between small arms and guns. Guns are artillery pieces such as howitzers, naval guns and anti-aircraft cannon, as well as autocannons and tank guns. Of those weapons properly called guns, then, which are also cannon? Those whose primary function is direct fire. While howitzers, naval guns and to a lesser extent mortars are theoretically capable of direct fire, their primary intended function is to produce indirect fire, and are therefore not properly called cannon. In modern warfare, the only guns that still count as cannon are anti-aircraft guns, autocannons and tank guns.  This is the \u201c12-pounder Napoleon,\u201d the most popular field artillery piece of the American Civil War. It\u2019s a gun [check], and its primary use was direct fire [check] therefore it is a cannon [ding, ding, ding!]. In modern warfare, however, the closest thing we still have to this is the gun on a tank. Nearly all other modern field artillery consists of howitzers (or rockets, but that\u2019s another show).
