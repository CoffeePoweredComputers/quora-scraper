            "answer_text": "This is an excellent question and one I can answer only by \u201cYes and No.\u201d I will explain why. The Genetics Legacy It is true that the territory of what is now France was largely inhabited by Celtic tribes referred to by the Romans as Gauls and it is also true that after the Roman conquest of the region by Julius Caesar, the people of that region would come to be known as \u201cGallo-Romans\u201d because of the mix that will happen between the Roman colonists and the Gaulish people. You can see that the Indo-European Haplogroup R1b (whose S116 lineage represents Celtic lineages) of Celtic population lineage is still over-represented in France making of strong case for the Gaulish legacy.  Now to dial it down : it is estimated than 1 million Gaulish warriors were killed during Caesar\u2019s campaigns and another 1 million enslaved. Adding to that population decrease the following centuries have seen a great number of \u201cinvasions\u201d or population displacements : Franks (from which our country got its name) and Normans (settling in what is now Normandy.) Centuries of mixing have made the French people a great melting pot, on par with the US : Mediterranean blood will be found in the Southern population, and our policy on jus soli have allowed us to naturalized people from all other the world (mainly the former colonies in the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa) History and politics When a regime is thrown down, the new elite will find a way of re-writing history to legitimate its power : that\u2019s what happened in a number of former Soviet countries that dug deep in their respective histories to find a local hero or a tribe that were the ancestors of today\u2019s people. France is no exception to the rule and since French kings proud themselves of being the heirs of Clovis, king of the Franks, the Republic would have to find another mythology. Hence Gauls became our only true ancestors in the history books : they were not soldiers but farmers and they seemed like a great allegory of what the French people was supposed to look like. This culminated during the Third Republic (1870\u20131930) were children were taught the now classic phrase \u201cNos anc\u00eatres les Gaulois\u2026\u201d (Our ancestors the Gauls\u2026) to such an extent that this was supposedly taught in a comical anachronistic manner to any child in the French Empire : in Morocco, in Vietnam as well as in Gabon ! Conclusion We are now rediscovering the heritage of the Gauls through various exhibitions and recent archaeological discovering and we still are very fond of the comrades of Asterix : symbol of an untamed people. But French people are so much more than that : Celtic, Roman, Germanic and now in all colors and shapes ! EDIT : As User-10156055386280151797 noticed, culture also plays a role in a people\u2019s legacy. We know that Gaulish religion had completely gone extinct and as for the language, it has survived mostly in toponyms and hydronyms as well as a few hundreds loanwords. French is probably the language that retained the most from the Gaulish language but it is still a very small legacy. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, the vast majority if the French population are Gauls. Or descend from Gauls. They have been mixed over the years, with Franks, with Normans and others too, but these peoples were genetically pretty much identical to the Gauls anyhow (they were all Native Europeans with blonde hair and blue eyes), so this changed nothing. The only real mixture happened in Southern France, with Greeks and Romans, who were already mixed peoples. Over the years this admixture spread darker features, but until the \u201cFrench\u201d revolution France was still an overwhelmingly Native European (or \u201cNordic\u201d if you like) nation. The revolution changed this to some degree, as the most Nordic peoples living in France were targeted. The Nobles. Looking \u201ctoo\u201d Nordic was enough to get you killed at the time. Then came the Spanish Civil War, before WWII, and millions of Spanish peoples fled to France, and settled there. If you find a dark looking \u201cFrench Frenchman\u201d (I. e. not Afro-Asian immigrant) today, you are very likely to discover that he descends from one of these (or from Portuguese immigrants). The Frenchmen did not look like that. They were still Nordic-looking, more or less. Then you have the post-WWII mass immigration, from North Africa, Asia and Africa, about 10 million or so today, I would think, including half-breeds, but I guess this question is not about them. Conclusion: although a bit mixed with African and Asians, via the Romans and Greeks, and later with the Spanish (and also Portuguese), the Native people of France are still Gauls. ",

Some (though probably not many) are descended from Romans (probably more Italian lineage is due to modern immigration). Many are descended from various Germanic groups - the Franks, the Burgundians, the Allemani, etc. Jews and Mideastern Christians were already there in early medieval Gaul, so some have that lineage as well. No doubt a few Arabs came up from Spain, as well. Most probably have some mixture of these, plus all the different immigrant groups - first European, then from Asia and Africa - which started arriving in the nineteenth century. ",
