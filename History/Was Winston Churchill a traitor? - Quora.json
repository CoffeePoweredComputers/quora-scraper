            "answer_text": " Churchill and Lord Halifax Certainly. He was a traitor to the appeasers. He was a traitor to the pacifists. He was a traitor to those who naively believed life under Nazi rule would not be bad. Churchill knew and appreciated what Hitler was. He could not be trusted. He could not be depended on. He could not be believed. Churchill knew there was a class of people in Britain willing to sacrifice the fate of Britain and most of its inhabitants in order to preserve their position and place for themselves. Their own position was more important that the fate of their fellow Britons. Churchill was clearly a traitor to this class. ",

            "answer_text": "One of FDR\u201ds main war aims was the destruction of the British Empire, which Churchill helped him achieve. Britain was perceived to be America\u2019s greatest post war rival. The American writers Benn Steil and Lynne Olson explain FDR\u2019s strategy towards Britain. The financial deals that Churchill negotiated were awful and left Britain bankrupt in 1947. The US was more generous to the Soviet Union and China. The jet engine was invented in Britain, yet he gave the technology away for free. Churchill was half-American and he seemed to be trying to help the US achieve its objectives. In that sense he may have been a traitor to Britain. ",
