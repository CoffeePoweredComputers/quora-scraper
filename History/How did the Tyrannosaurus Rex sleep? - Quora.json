            "answer_text": "This is one hell of an interesting question. The short answer is \u201cwe don't know\u201d.  Well known fact that T-Rex gets cranky when it can't sleep I see the other answer on here says that large therapods likely lay down to sleep. This may be correct, but I have my doubts.  Pictured above is a toy replica of a T-Rex's famous two-fingered front limbs. These little arms have puzzled science for more than a century, as their use is not clear at all. Sure, they were each capable of lifting 450lbs, but considering that this is an animal that can possibly exert a nearly 60kN bite, the arms doesn't stack up. But why do they have them, then? Like I said, this question has puzzled us for over a century and some theories have come to the forefront. One is that the tyrannosaur family evolved bigger and broader heads and for that to happen, the arms had to diminish. By the time Daspletosaurus and Albertosaurus show up - some millions of years before Rex - this was already a feature. Possible use for the arms might be for use during mating; we see some snakes and reptiles scratch their mates in order to stimulate them (not so different from us?) and it is entirely possible that the Tyrannosaurs used their diminished forelimbs for the act of love. Okay, so where does that leave us? With the fact that even though these arms can pick up nearly 500 lbs, but will that be enough to help up a sleeping T-Rex? The animal's max weight estimates exceeds TEN TONNES. That is like an Olympic weightlifting champion attempting to deadlift a front end loader. With that in mind, I am not so sure that they could lay down. Okay great. So what did they do? Like I said earlier, we are not sure. Maybe they did lay down or did more of a curled sit, I don't know. Or maybe they did this:  Considering that modern day birds stem from therapod dinosaurs AND that they still share a lot of the same traits (feathers, hollow bones, s-s-shaped neck, wishbone, same hip structure) it is not an improbable hypothesis that T-Rex could sleep standing up. The reasons I think this could work: T-Rex had a massive tail it could use as a counterbalance whilst sleepingGetting up from the ground would be a doozy for the Rex; this negates that difficult taskT-Rex easily had the feet and legs to support it during its sleeping hours.I hope this was an interesting read Peace ",
