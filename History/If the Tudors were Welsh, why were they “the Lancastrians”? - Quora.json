            "answer_text": "Because Owen Tudor, the first to take the surname (which was his grandfather\u2019s first name), was the choice as second husband of Queen Catherine, after the second Lancastrian king, Henry V, died young in 1422. Because her father, Charles VI of France, also died about the same time, with her brother, the Dauphin\u2019s status doubtful because of the Treaty of Troyes, she was in a position to decide for herself, and apparently chose her charismatic favourite Welsh courtier for love. This brought Owen into the high English politics of the Lancastrian court, as step-father of Henry VI, and his sons, Henry VI\u2019s half-brothers, Edmund and Jasper Tudor, became stalwarts of the Lancastrian cause. Although this step-relationship gave them no claim to the English throne, their status was high enough that Edmund married Margaret Beaufort, who, as a descendant of John of Gaunt, son of Edward III and first Duke of Lancaster, had some sort of quasi-Lancastrian claim, which suddenly became rather more important and convincing when the main Lancastrian line was wiped out in the bloody events of 1471. Edmund and Margaret were parents of the first Tudor king, Henry VII. Edmund died before Henry was born, but Margaret outlived him. However, the idea of a reigning queen was controversial at the time, and she preferred to let her son reign, with herself as a mighty matriarch behind the scenes. ",
