            "answer_text": "Thats quite simple, really. We begin with World War One. This war started in 1914, and while its one hundred and TWO years ahead of 2016, the last two years of it are still less than 100 years ago. This war brought America out of it\u2019s isolationist shell and established it as a world power, sowed the seeds of hatred that would begin World War II, dissolved Austro-Hungarian Empire, and in a way helped to start the Bolshevik Revolution, turning Russia into the communistic Soviet Union. Got Lenin? World War II One does not simply say WW II is unimportant. WW II led to the creation of the rocket, making it possible for Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to land on the Moon, created the atomic bomb which started the nuclear arms race, and begun the battle between the West and East, Democracy vs. Communism. And, ironically (but not in a funny way), it led to the creation of Israel. The Cold War What can I say? Nuke race, spaceship race, constant threat of nuclear destruction, and western ideals against eastern ideals. Great times. The Vietnam and Korean War These are smaller wars, but they definitely impacted the world in one way or another. These wars aren't my area of expertise, but they\u2019re pretty much the same as what I said about the Cold War above. Only difference is that these wars scared America with the so called \u201c\"Domino effect\u201d where America and its allies feared if Korea or Vietnam went full on commie, then other countries would follow. The War on Terror I can't pass this up. Especially with what happened in Orlando recently. My heart goes out to all the families affected and anyone on Quora affected by this tragedy. The War on Terror. The fight to eliminate Islamic Extremists. Starting with the 9/11 terror attack, this war has been and will be like no other. The war hit a major milestone when Osama Bin Laden was killed. But things changed drastically when ISIS popped up. You hear about bombings every other day or every other week in the news in places like Istanbul or Baghdad where ISIS has a large influence, and thats bad enough. But when these attacks are focused on world powers, things get drastically worse. First Paris. Now Orlando. This war won't be over for years. These extremists even threaten their very brothers and sisters who wish no harm upon other religions. The world can\u2019t truly be safe until the world is rid of them. ",
