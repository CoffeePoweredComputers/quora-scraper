            "answer_text": "Grizzly bears routinely kill and eat moose. I suppose it is possible that a large bull moose could use its horns to kill a small brown bear if everything went just right for the moose, but most of the time, moose winds up on the menu. And you are not necessarily correct when you say grizzlies are mean and aggressive. They can be but many times they are just ambling through life, trying to fatten up before winter. I have had numerous encounters with bears when they were not aggressive. Sometimes they were curious about me. Other times they did not appear to give me one ounce of attention. Of course, I did not get between a sow and cubs, nor did I interfere with their food, but if a bear is on a salmon stream and a moose wanders by, I would expect the bear to continue to eat salmon because it is far easier to get salmon than to kill a moose. Once the moose smelled the bear, though, the moose would be leaving quickly. ",

            "answer_text": "50\u201350 chance on getting a dinner. Yes bears eat plenty of moose, but moose are big animals. And tough. And mean. A full grown bull moose is not gonna be a bear\u2019s 1st. choice for dinner. Moose calves, yes; a sick or wounded moose, yes. Big Daddy or Mama, no.  This bear isn\u2019t even thinking about eating the healthy, bull moose. Matter of fact, he\u2019s getting out of his way.  Watch out Mama!  This bear is eyeing the newborn calves, not Mama!  Baby Moose gonna be bear lunch. Most predators go for the sick, young or crippled. Why risk injury attacking a healthy animal when the other option is easier & safer? ",
