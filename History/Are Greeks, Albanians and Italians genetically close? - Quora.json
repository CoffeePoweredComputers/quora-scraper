            "answer_text": "Yes. First of all, all Europeans are very close genetically, they have a lower genetic diversity than any other continent. Now if you look at Europeans from the southern most Greek islands to Nordic fjords you see a range of skin, hair and eye colors. That should remind us that the superficial differences are literally, just skin deep, and how much environment plays a role including on genetics. It seems that a large part of the genetic ancestry of Europe goes back to prehistory. Certain genetic clusters show \u201cwaves\u201d in which these stone age people settled in Europe. Greece shows a high genetic diversity as, located at the gateway of Europe and Asia, shows a mixture of an older paleolithic people (who moved on and settled Europe) and then a later, neolithic group who entered from the middle east and brought with them agriculture. As the Balkans transition into Europe their influence wanes. You also see them entering into Southern Italy. So in that way Greece, and her neighbors of Albania and the South-East of Italy all share that background. In fact, for Greeks about 80% of their ancestry is made up of this old stone age meets new stone age. Among Greeks and Southern Italians they cluster very close, because \u201ctraffic\u201d between the two never really stopped until the Ottoman period. Greeks settled in Italy (Magna Graecia) and at times Greeks fled back to Greece and from Greece to Italy again\u2014though by the Ottoman times both of them were ruled by other cultures that were at least somewhat hostile to the traditional Greek culture in both places. Today southern Italy is mostly \u201cItalian\u201d with only tiny pockets of Greek speaking villages, but from the Valle dei Templi ruins to the genetics of the people to some of the vocabulary of the local dialects the Hellenic history is not that far gone. **Specifically it is Southern Italy that is close to Greece, northern Italians are much closer to that of France and Austria.** ",

            "answer_text": "I can only speak for the Calabria region, which is where my mother and her family comes from.  This is where Calabria is in Italy:   This is a screenshot of Calabria from Google maps:   Near the city of Reggio Calabria, there are villages where the people speak a dialect that is completely obscure to the rest of Italy, but mutually intelligible with Greek. It is a variety of the Calabrese dialect, or Calabrian, which I speak and my family speaks (mother\u2019s side). My grandmother comes from this region and her surname is an \u201citalianized\u201d Greek word. Besides the fact that Southern Italy was part of Magna Grecia, this \u201cGreek-Calabrian-Italian\u201d dialect is actually mutually intelligible with Modern Greek rather than Ancient Greek. This shows that Greek settlements in Calabria must have been quite recent and our descending from them doesn't need to go thousands of years in the past. (There are also areas in the region of Puglia where their Pugliese dialect is mutually intelligible with Greek and not remotely understandable by any other Italian.) Regarding Albanian, in Calabria there are various towns around the area of Cosenza where the Calabrian dialect sounds a lot more like Albanese than anything else. In fact you could just say that in this part of Calabria they speak Albanese. Again, a form of Albanese with strong Calabrian and Italian influence, but it is Albanese. The most prominent town in this area is Spezzano Albanese, which as you can see has even the word \u201cAlbanese\u201d in it. People from Albania build this town in the 15th century and settled there. As you can see, the people from Calabria are genetically close to Albanians and Greeks, because they are our great-great-great-great-grandparents! ",

Considering the fact that Constantinople or Byzantine Empire was found by Illyrian emperor Constantine and it lasted a millenium longer than Roman Empire, this makes things a lot different, beyond that Venetians are Illyrian tribe Veneti(Herodotus), and other tribes located in south, and central Italy. A study showed that Italians DNA especially northern part are Illyrians. I think for Italians(Romans) and Illyrians(Byzantines) its time to think differently and consider a new Roman-Byzantine or Illyrian-Roman Renaissance. ",

They have big ears, some of them look darkish, some of them more Germanic, big foreheads and their body structure is somewhat shorter legs, longer torso\u2026(?) They also have a habit to sit in their legs while waiting for something (bus, conversations or anything) something we do not do\u2026 And the blood type by their majority is b. I dont know if they have any genetical similarities with Italians, but some italians do look more scandinavian. As for cultural, I know a albanian lady and we do exchange some foods in time, they look similar, but she loves tomatoes very much\u2026VERY much, all the salsa in her food are HEAVY tomatoed, hot and lots of pickles.

European DNA project: Albanians in Albania:27.5% E1bjb North African haplogroup; 19.5% J2 Middle Eastern haplogroup; 16% R1b Western European haplogroup; 12% I2 / I2a proto-European, native haplogroup; 9% Slavic R1a haplogroup. Albanians in Kosovo and Metohija (Serbia):47.5% E1b1b North African haplogroup; 21% R1b Western European haplogroup; 16.5% J2 Middle Eastern haplogroup. Other percentages are far lower. First: The answer to those who claim that Albanians are natives of the Balkans - only 12% of the population of Albania has an old European I2/I2a haplogroup. Second: If you are interested in genetic similarities with Italians and Greeks, take a look at the site European Y-DNA haplogroups frequencies by country ",

I was convinced us Albanians have no connection with Greeks & Italians, apart from maybe cultural similarities, given that we are neighbors. My ancestry showed I was 84% Southern European and that is the common gene for Greece, Italy, some parts of Macedonia & some parts of West Turkey. Apparently, like it or not we are in the same gene family. Tough luck my dears, hope that will chill down the fascists among you\u2026 ",

I responded to her in Italian language that i was sorry but i was not from italy. After this she was looking at me in a certain way and i suppose she was thinking how rude i was. I realised that it was so rude cause i could respond to her in english language, and i feelt so sorry about this. Anyway i showed this example cause i think that people are not or should not be looked as different. Im from the south of Albania and i sing a lot of Greek songs, speak very well Italian and i have a turkish surname. ",
