            "answer_text": " Effect of COVID-19 on Aviation sector of India. COVID-19 crisis likely to hit 29 lakh jobs in Indian aviation, dependent sectors: IATA Commercial flight services in the country remain suspended till 24 may to curb spreading of coronavirus infections. Aviation and tourism are among the worst affected segments. Revenue impact for airlines operating to and from the Indian market would be USD 11.221 billion. In March airlines felt the growing Impact of COVID-19 related border closings and restrictions on mobility in domestic as well as international markets. The aviation sector has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The grounding has led to airline revenues falling to zero and the sector not being able to service its fixed cost and other liabilities. Commercial airlines in India have grounded all of their 650 aircraft but have started flying a few after the Directorate General of Civil aviation (DGCA) allowed them to carry cargo in passenger aircraft. Only cargo flights and special flights are permitted during the lockdown India\u2019s Aviation sector lies perilously close to bankruptcy as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. No Indian carrier is even in a position to refund passengers who had booked flights. Instead, SpiceJet, Vistara, Indigo and GoAir have told passengers that their bookings for travel upto May 3 were cancelled and that their entire amount will be secure in a \"credit-shell\" which can be used to re-book travel later in the year or early next year. Different airlines had announced different pay policies for lockdown Indigo announced a pay cut of up to 25 per cent for its senior employees and Vistara announced compulsory leave without pay for up to three days for its senior employees in March, etc. It has huge effect on passenger traffic, air cargo demand, airport workforce and incoming revenues and many more. airlines that aren\u2019t seen as important enough and which are cash-strapped, will not survive this, unless they have a lot of assets on their balance sheet that they can sell off. The Civil Aviation Ministry has allowed one third domestic flight operations to resume from 25May. fare structure has been decided such that both airlines and flyers benefit from the ticket price. To help aviation sector government is helping their industry with SOPs so that they don't have to lay off the employees as well as sail through in this difficult time . IATA (International Air Transport Association) are working day and night to safeguard the small and large aviation enterprises from the pandemic. It could take air travel from several months to two years to recover to 2019 levels. As the Flights are started from 25 May so The recovery of the Aviation Industry can be seen but it is slow and laborious. But Airlines have to wait really long to cover up with all the losses that they have made due to COVID-19. The travel industry and airlines will also face gradual decrease in customers as people have spent all their savings in lockdown period so they are left with no savings. Without savings people can not travel and hence will have negative impact on demand of aviation facilities. Even after the lockdown ends aviation sector will still face huge problems.

            "answer_text": "Once travel restrictions are lifted, the airlines will be slow to put planes back in service. This is deliberate. A lot of passengers will not be in a financial position or have any time off for travel. The business sector will still continue with virtual meetings, and far less travel will be required. So aviation as a whole will in a slow recovery mode for months. ",
