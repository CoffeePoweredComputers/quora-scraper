            "answer_text": "Well this was called Operation Silver Fox and was a joint operation between Finnish and German troops and was started only after the ussr bombed Finnish cities. The Germans made up the bulk of the operation with 2 Finnish divisions in cooperation. One of the main issues that this operation was not successful was due to the German troops not being well trained nor well prepared in Arctic warfare. While the German troops did not gain ground, the Finnish troops did well and carried most of the successful campaigns in this operation. The real issue toward the end of the operation and its failure was largely due to considerable political pressure from the west as Finland was told they should not cut off supply routes of the soviet union, otherwise they may face dire consequences at wars end. The other reason was that the red army increased their numbers and set up a more robust defense or Murmansk. As for Leningrad, while the Germans aim was to capture and even raze the city, the Finnish aim was never to capture nor to attack the city of Leningrad. This was not the reason Finland was fighting the Continuation War, they were only looking to regain illegally stolen lands and to set up a defense for the inevitable 2nd strike of the red army. The Finns had to sign on with one devil to fight a more ominous devil. I will say had somehow Germany won then I am sure Finland would have had some extra land into Russian Karelia, however the Finns more than likely would never have wanted anything to do with St Petersburg(Leningrad), as this was never historically Finnish and Finns have not ever been known to be aggressors unless provoked to defend themselves, and indeed Finns are known to be staunch defenders as has been proven in ww2.

            "answer_text": "> Why didn't Finland capture (attack) strategic Murma\u00f1sk and Leningrad during the German-Soviet war? First, Finland did attack Murmansk in coordination with German troops.  Why Finland did not captured it? Because this plan failed, plain and simple. Finnish troops were only able advance about 30 km, and where were about 70 km more - but while for Finland was able to put first class troops, German only send second-line troops for this operation. For example, 221 Pz.Abt. (221th Tank Battalion) which Germany transferred to Finland in June, 10th 1941 was consisting of French tanks, only 41 Hotchkiss 35/39 and 18 Somua S-35 tanks. Those tanks while having pretty good armor were absolutely unsuitable for deep interdiction strikes in classic Wehrmacht style, thats why Soviet Army had not that much problems stopping them, using pre-war fortified lines:  Other German divisions were infantry divisions and mountain corps (which, while being much better trained, had not enough artillery/heavy weapons as any mountain division would), for example Army of Norway (Wehrmacht) So the joint German-Finnish offense was just stalled by defending Soviet troops, you can read more about it, for example, here: Operation Silver Fox So in short the answer is: Finland actually launched the attack on Murmansk (in cooperation with Germany) Finland and Germany failed to advance far enough to fulfill the plans.
