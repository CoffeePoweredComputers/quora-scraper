            "answer_text": "If your internet included email and WiFi it would have made an incredible difference. I am old enough to remember having to go to the library to look things up in a reference book. Or sending a letter. Calling long distance cost money. Or getting all my news on tv or in a newspaper. In the 1800s you had to use a telegraph to communicate. They cost a lot to send and you were charged by the word. The mail was slow along with the news. Andrew Jackson fought the brittish in New Orleans after the peace treaty for the War of 1812 was signed. He didn't know. They learned everything from books. If you didn't have access to books you were out of luck. Industry and technology would have grown because information and ideas could have been shared. President makes a speech. Reporters wrote down the speech. It was then tapped out on a telegraph or by horse or ship delivered to the newspaper. It took a lot of time. President Lincoln could get on you tube and talk directly to southerners directly. Orders could have been emailed. There was all kinds of delays in the Mexican American war relaying what we wanted to do with Mexico. Lots of miscommunication. It would have made a very big difference. The world is connected now. World war one might have been diverted because diplomats, kings, Kaisers and Tsars could have skyped and talked it out. Even a calculator would have changed thingscdramatically. Excel changed accounting and business. Internet dramatically changed everyone's life in our modern times. It's amazing. Thank you Al Gore. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, the question is hard to answer, because in order to have the Internet in 1800, the history leading up to that would have to be radically different. If we stipulate that the \u2018Net, and all it\u2019s infrastructure just magically poofs into existence one sunny day, those of use who knew what to do with it would probably be hanged as witches. ;) While I jest on that matter, it brings up an important point: people need a social context in which to understand the capabilities technology affords them, in order to exploit it to advance their interests. There are lots of folks today who don\u2019t really understand what capabilities the \u2018Net offers them, or how to leverage it. Someone from 1801 is at a much worse disadvantage. Telegraphy is still almost 40 years away. People generally start with the familiar, and expand from that. Sending letters and reading books online would be the starting point. Publishing the same would be the next step. Photography was in its infancy, but that would be approachable as well. Movies and videos, and telephony are right out. People didn\u2019t have what\u2019s called a \u201cdesign grammar\u201d that allows them to understand and interpret what they see, and so there\u2019d be all sorts of chaos, at least in the short term, while folks got their minds wrapped around it. No matter what, you can be assured, however, that porn apps will lead the way. ",
