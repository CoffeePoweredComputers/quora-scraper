            "answer_text": "Original Question: \u201cWhy do scots wear kilts?\u201d Men in Scotland, and not just Scots by birth, will often wear kilts to formal events, particularly weddings, graduations and dances or ceilidhs. They sometimes also wear them less formally, for example with a jumper and hiking boots to rugby matches and outdoor events. It\u2019s a pretty much a sure fire way of getting a lift if you\u2019re hitch hiking abroad. Men look and feel fantastic in kilts. You see them stand differently and develop a swagger. It\u2019s extremely attractive! My son recently went to a university dance with Polish and Iranian friends. All wore kilts, and they looked wonderful. The kilt has been worn since at least the 16th Century. Before that, Medieval men wore longer tunics with a heavy woollen cloak. When wool became more available this outfit mutated into recognisable Scottish garb. The tunic gradually became shorter, ultimately into a long loose linen shirt (the cutty sark). Meantime, the wool cloak became bigger and was used as a `multi-functional wrap. Two bolts of cloth were sewn together lengthwise. The wearer arranged these into pleats and belted it around the waist. The lower bolt of cloth hung down to the knee. The upper half could be wrapped around the body as a warm and almost windproof covering. This is how the \u201cgreat kilt\u201d - the feileadh M\u00f2r came into being. At night, the kilt was taken off and became a large blanket or make-shift shelter. They were incredibly practical, and would have been partly responsible the Highlanders\u2019 survival in a variable and often harsh climate. A description from 1746 states: The garb is certainly very loose, and fits men inured to it to go through great fatigues, to make very quick marches, to bear out against the inclemency of the weather, to wade through rivers, and shelter in huts, woods, and rocks upon occasion; which men dressed in the low country garb could not possibly endure. [See Ref] Around the late 17th - early 18th Century, a less cumbersome version of the kilt, the f\u00e8ileadh beag, was developed. Essentially, this was made from one bolt of cloth, omitting the the over-shoulder plaid. The pleats were permanently stitched into place, so the cloth could no longer be opened into a blanket. It is this form of the kilt which survives to the present day. I get enthusiastic on this subject and could all too easily write more. If anyone wants further details about the history of kilts, including how they were banned following the Jacobite uprising of 1745, send me an A2A. I will close now before this becomes a dissertation. Reference Forbes, Lord Culloden, Duncan (1815), Culloden Papers, London: T Cadell & W Davies, p. 289 . ",
