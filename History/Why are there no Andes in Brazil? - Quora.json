            "answer_text": "Take a look at a map of South America. Do you see that large river down South by Buenos Aires, Argentina? That\u2019s the Plata River (actually an estuary). Why the name? Because the Spaniards, when they first arrived in that area, circa 1516, found quite some silver artifacts (plata, in Spanish) with the locals. Upon inquiry, they learned that they had been traded with people living upstream. Naturally, the Spanish crown became very interested in sending expeditions upriver to find and secure the source of all that silver. The largest tributary to the Plata River is the Paran\u00e1 River. If you follow it North, beyond what is today Corrientes, you will reach the Paraguay River. It crosses what is today Paraguay and, eventually, takes you close to Bolivia and a large swampy area in the heart of South America. After some time, and many tribes of Natives in their way, the Spaniards arrived at Potosi in Bol\u00edvia, where the silver was being mined. Some say that one of the mountains was made of almost pure silver. The Portuguese were not so lucky. They had settled further Northeast and had to cross quite some land to reach the Paran\u00e1 basin. There, they met the Guarani-Kaiowa and some other tribes that presented fierce resistance against their advance towards the Andes. Further North, the Portuguese secured most of the Amazonian basin, but never got to the Andes either. The Spaniards had arrived first. So, because Portugal never got to the Andes foothills ahead of Spain, the modern country of Brazil has no part of the Andes mountain range in its territory. ",

So, in the position Brazil is located, over the South American Plate, we are safe from earthquakes and we do not have big mountains like Andes and Himalaia.  ",
