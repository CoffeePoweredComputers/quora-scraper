            "answer_text": "Well first I would like to say that I am in no way an expert in this field. With that said nearly every single answer and potentially the question start with glaring assumptions. The first assumption is that humans have never possessed modern technology in the past. If you examine modern technology the more mass produced items are then logically the cheaper their construction. If you go back in antiquity singular items that are made by hand are made of more sturdy materials. So simply going back ten thousand years what kinds of items do we tend to find? We tend to find statues, pottery, and metal objects although many have succumbed to corrosion. Simply ask yourself if you found a circuit board that was one hundred thousand years old what would it look like? Well plastic decomposes after a few hundred to a thousand years. The metals would corrode. The bigger question is if you or better yet an archaeologist found a circuit board \u201cfossil\u201d would they know what it is? I think that is highly unlikely. There are plenty of seemingly anachronistic objects in antiquity that we do recognize as anomalies that do not fit with the \u201cproper\u201d view of history like the piri reis map that are difficult to explain. The Baghdad Battery is another difficult to explain anomaly. So my point is we do not look for technology like that in the past necessarily and more times than not try as hard as we can to maintain current views of a linear human development even though we existed as modern humans for around 200k years and went from mud huts to airplanes in 10k years (really less than that). The next assumption is that our planet was somewhat similar to what it is now consistently. It wasn\u2019t. When the polar caps were larger then the habitable land masses were areas of much lower elevation, closer to the equator. So where was this? It is underwater right now. Water tends to move about, break down, and corrode things rather quickly and this is mostly salt water. Then consider other earthly events that may have occurred over the course of the last 200k years and the chances we would easily find, accept as reality, and recognize past technologies is infinitesimally slim. Even if you did find it automatically your brain would start rationalizing it. A third assumption is that a past technological society was uniformly global. Take for example the organization of isolated city states or continents. Let us imagine that an Atlantis existed. They were not interested in global expansion, but perhaps trade. Let us then say their technology advanced rather quickly and they had electronics, zeppelins, working toilets, powered boats, etc. So if you are an isolated culture with advanced technology and you are surrounded by scattered tribes and bronze or stone age peoples how likely is it that you would trust them with your advanced technology? Not likely right? No Phtung I am not going to trust you with my AK47 not matter how many times you offer your daughter\u2019s hand in marriage. You might however offer some nifty parlor tricks to some phoenicians like rudimentary working bulb lights and wine based batteries . Why? Because its not super advanced. They can recharge it with wine. Its just nifty and its cheap to make and they gave you a metric ton of gold in exchange. Then you show Carthaginian traders how to make running toilets. I think you get the picture. The thought that a past technological society would HAVE to be global is not necessarily true. Then finding evidence of that past isolated society would require A. knowing where it was and B. hanging out for long periods of time on the bottom of the ocean since common wisdom says that Atlantis flooded which would likely have occurred at the end of the last ice age where MOST of our flood myths were likely based including Noah and his ark. We have a tendency to look back in the past and see savages and morons. We have routinely been rebuffed on this concept as we delve further back in history and our tools become more adept at deciphering the mysteries of the past. It is true that Vikings traveled great distances. It is true that the Phoenicians did as well. We also tend to see all past civilizations as these monolithic blocks that NEVER encountered one another. That\u2019s simply not the case. I would also think that most of our shared history likely has some beginning based in fact. I personally suspect that we did have a certain amount of technology in the past but just like the fire at the library of Alexandria we have lost almost as much as we have gained. I think these odd anachronistic artifacts from the past and our shared mythos reveal that we did have at the least more technology in the past than we give them credit for. I find it much more improbable that we had NEVER had any close approximation to this technology in about 200k years. It just seems highly improbable. Only WE are intelligent enough to make a toaster oven or figure out that compressed steam can move stuff. Yeah sure\u2026 but thats me. ",

            "answer_text": "Not enough time, not enough history, not enough humans. The not enough humans problem is particularly salient. The modern world talks about \u2018overpopulation\u2019 so much that many people don\u2019t realize that you need a vast population to have a high rate of invention and technological development. But you also need time for technology to be developed, and a continuous history so that inventors have some idea of what has and hasn\u2019t been tried (keep them from just constantly reinventing the wheel). Technological development is an interative process. You have to start with basic inventions that utilize existing technology and work out the bugs so that they are actually useful in helping people survive. That takes time. Then you need to record what you invented (and approaches that didn\u2019t work, which a lot of early history neglected cause it\u2019s embarrassing) so that later generations don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel. Recording history takes technology, inferior record-keeping technology means your history keeps disappearing faster than you write it at at some point. And most important you need a large population in which there are a lot of people who are freed up to do inventing as a full-time activity. This is so absolutely crucial and the \u201cpopulation control\u201d crowd utterly dismisses the importance. That\u2019s really why questions like this get asked. You don\u2019t really need billions of people in a global civilization, you can have an advanced technological society with just millions in a fairly small nation. But you need lots and lots of people, living in a pretty highly specialized civilization. And those don\u2019t last forever, it\u2019s a late-stage of civilization development that\u2019s generally followed fairly quickly by a massive collapse of the civilization. As our global civilization is about to demonstrate in the most dramatic collapse in human history. ",
