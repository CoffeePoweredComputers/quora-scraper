            "answer_text": "Said in jest: The worst year to buy a PC was\u2026. ANY year I bought a PC. You see I started young, and the industry was young too. So after starting with a Sinclair and then the VIC20, C64, and gawds SX64, I started looking at Amigas. A year or so later PC games started coming into their own and the PC wasn\u2019t a business inventory, sales management, personnel database only device, it could actually be fun. And Amiga\u2026 well, that\u2019s history folks\u2026 so\u2026 Now I have the suite of Microsoft tablet pcs and the Studio all in one. They, of course, by now, are becoming dated. So, there\u2019s a company out there who \u2018rents\u2019 remote workstation configurations located in server farms and have a direct connection to high-density fiber trunks. They can update storage, cores, memory, and bandpass on-demand. I may have solved my PC purchasing curse, but I think I\u2019ve fallen deep into the rabbit hole. YMMV, good luck! :) ",

            "answer_text": "2008 Because just about every PC on the shelf of your local electronics store came with Windows Vista. I bought one Lenovo laptop that year using my IBM employee discount. Every time I opened the screen it took 10 minutes before I could do anything useful. Spent about a month trying to fix the problems and gave up. Tried installing XP and Microsoft didn\u2019t see my point of view in installing an older version of the OS. Fortunately \u201cformat c:\u201d works quite well if booting from an alternate device. That laptop has gone to the electronics graveyard in my garage, but still own a 2009 desktop running Linux without any problems. ",

Just look at all those people who forked out for a 2080 in 2020, only for NVidea to announce a much more powerful 3080 for nearly half the money a few months later. ",
