            "answer_text": "You are a blind, deaf hypocrite and a child of the devil and not the child of faith that you claim to be. This is the sort of wisdom that God's people needed to hear - and this is what Jesus gave them to consider. Did they love it? Would I? Likely not, but what he saw was truth, what he said was truth and later, it would - by some - be recognised as very wise and for their benefit. When I sit to eat a meal which has been prepared for me by the Lord, will I tell Him of all the things that I have done? - and will I take large helpings of sweet praise and ham it up for laughs? Better maybe for me to consider what He has done and ask for more truth - unleavened truth - another helping couldn't hurt. Maybe I cannot answer this question as it is asked - because I may not love wisdom \u2026maybe I fear it - because it tries me and finds me wanting\u2026always. Wisdom is one, and does not contradict, so there is no choosing a preference, and maybe this all sounds contrarian, but rather than stand on it \u2026 pray, give me opportunity to occasionally bow before it and receive what I need without flinching.

These things do not conflict or oppose each other in any way. I will take from each category what it\u2019s worth and be stronger and better-equipped thereby. Wisdom does not consist in choosing one thing to \u201cbe your stand\u201d and disdaining others also good, when the good of all is freely available. Your categories strike me as arbitrary as well. I\u2019d have divided philosophy into ontology (or if you prefer, metaphysics), epistemology and ethics. Doesn\u2019t matter though. How we divide does not change what is, and to disregard truth out of a regard for artificial divisions or perspectives is not wisdom but folly. ",
