            "answer_text": "There was an elderly Jewish couple who managed to stay hidden in Berlin as the war was winding down. Daily the old man had to leave to the safety of his hiding spot to discretely search for food for himself and his wife. As careful as he was, one day he ran into none other than Adolph Hitler himself. Hitler immediately pulled out his Luger ready to shoot the man when he noticed a pile of horse dung close by. So he ordered the Jewish man to get down on his hands and knees and start eating horse dung. As the man complied, Hitler started laughing so hard that he dropped the pistol. At this point the Jewish man picked up the gun, pointed it at Hitler, and ordered him to eat horse dung. Seeing an an opportunity the Jewish man fled and scrambled around to hide his path back home. When he finally got there, he sat down out of breath and blurted out to his wife, \u201cRachel, you'll never guess who I had lunch with!\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "No. Almost everyone had to go out for some reason, if only to look for food and water. As a rule, the shooting wasn\u2019t everywhere in the city although it might be a few blocks away from where you were. In Stalingrad, the Soviet troops generally stuck to abandoned buildings since it was easy enough to convert them into a mini-fort. The Germans were often tied up attacking these defensive positions and left the fully civilian buildings alone. They learned too late it was a bad idea to bomb the city - it created too many places for the Soviets to make makeshift defensive installations out of rubble. In Berlin, the Soviets weren\u2019t bombing the city and they also kept the shelling to a minimum, only targeting German positions. If you were a civilian, you probably wouldn\u2019t be shot if you stayed inside and hung a white surrender flag outside your window. However, the Soviets did rape pretty much every woman they came across. A lot of people resorted to subterfuge, like pretending other dead bodies were their wives and daughters. ",
