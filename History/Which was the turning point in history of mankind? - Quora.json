            "answer_text": "There have been a number of events from the Neolithic age to the Renaissance till the present world that have largely contributed to the way mankind dwells in its present state. One such significant moment of history occured on 20 April, 1889. You may recognise this date as well the number 420. On this day, Adolf Hitler was born near the German border. The man was responsible for a war of agression that we know as the second world war. This war changed the demographic politics of almost every continent saving Antarctica. Penguins weren't that interested. The interpretation of second world war presented to the world is that German forces lost badly and allied forces won. However, even though the post war picture wasn't exactly the way Hitler imagined but still, he was successful in achieving few of his motives. The Soviet Union crashed, Jews migrated in large numbers from Europe and Germany was established as a strong economy in the Europe. Some very peculiar events took place in world politics which were directly related to the war. Decolonisation rate increased and new countries were formed. Britian, France, Belgium and Netherlands lost their empires. India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Phillipines and a number of Arab nations gained independence. These countries now have a significant effect on major world politics. Europe's imperialism bit dust and a new superpower came into being. While United States of America was already seen as a land of opportunities, it was after the second world war that it became the strongest world power and easily affected European politics. It was the American battalion who managed their way into Hitler hidden grounds and found his body. America also procured German technology and warfare and Europe could do nothing. Europe was divided into US influenced region and Soviet region. The two superpowers who fought together as Allied forces during war became arch enemies and Cold War started. While an actual war never took place, espionage and proxy wars were common. While all this was happening, a new superpower was rising in Asia. People's Republic of China. A communist country that is today one of the strongest power in the world. Japan was exhausted from war and it was being rebuilt with aid from all over the world. Japanese technology continues to revolutionize the tech sector today. Israel gained independence from Mandatory Palestine and then later fought its wars. A big gift (or not) that came out of second world war was formation of United Nations by the Allied forces. It was formed in order to avoid the possibility of a third world war. Basically, if Hitler hadn't been born or infact, grown the way he did, it would have been possible that Europe would be still ruling Indian subcontinent, and Middle East. United States would be limited to the Americas and there would absolutely be no United Nations. Hitler was a disaster. But his acts influenced the world in ways that no one expected.

            "answer_text": "If a date had to be chosen, it would be the period between 1450 and 1550. In 1450, Johannes Gutenberg invented the movable type press. This laid the material base for knowledge-based economy and mass education. Literature and modern science were boosted by the multiplication of books, and experienced a major development in the following years. The same year, an architecture treaty was published by Alberti in Florence, establishing laws of perspective and paving the way to modern architecture. In 1453, Constantinople fell to the Turks. The migration of Byzantine scholars to the West, in particular Venice, brought preserved knowledge of Greek civilization, revived Greek and Roman studies, and led the way to humanism. The heritage of Antiquity was rediscovered, and a 1000-year-long gap in development was caught up in a few decades. The world was closing in the East, and soon about to open itself to the West. The Spanish and Portuguese explorations marked the beginning of globalization. In 1488, Vasco the Gama sailed all the way around Africa opening trade with India. In 1492, Christopher Columbus, financed by the Spanish royal family, crossed the Ocean and discovered a continent unknown to the rest of the world : America. In 1522, Magellan made the first journey around the world, confirming it was round, as this was still debated. These expeditions were the start of a globalized trade network between all continents. In 1520, the Protestant Reformation encouraged the common people to read the Bible in their own language. This gave a major boost to literacy. In 1543, Mercator started to publish maps based on rhumb lines, which opened the way to modern geography, establishing poles, equator, meridians and tropics. In 1543, Copernicus established the heliocentric system, calculating that the earth revolved around the Sun and not vice versa, which totally revolutioned astronomy. It the belief prevailing since Ptolemy that earth was the stationary center of the Universe. So many key events in a short time argue that, if there was a turning point in the history of mankind, this is most likely to have been then. ",
