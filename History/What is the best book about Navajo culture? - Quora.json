            "answer_text": "I never had one clear favorite, but Laura Gilpin\u2019s book. The Enduring Navaho (now hard to find\u2026) comes close. While it is a photo essay as well as a narrative, the visuals support and enhance the words really well. I also think that for a broader understanding, the Jim Chee Mysteries by Tony Hillerman add a great deal. I also recommend Navajo: A Century of Progress, published by KC Publications and edited by Martin A. Link for the Navajo Nation Centennial in 1968. Mr. Link assembled the Navajo\u2019s own words in essays about their culture and homeland as impacted by their forced removal at the hands of the US Army and later return to their homes in 1868. Any student of Navajo culture also needs to put their hands upon fine Navajo weaving and a range of the best Navajo silversmithing. The tactile nature of these arts convey much more than books alone can. ",
