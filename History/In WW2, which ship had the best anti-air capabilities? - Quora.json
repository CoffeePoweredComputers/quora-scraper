            "answer_text": "If you're looking purely at the most anti-aircraft capability in a single hull, then I think the award has to go to the Essex-class aircraft carrier. That said, counting those squadrons of Hellcats might be cheating. If we exclude those, then the next major contender would be the Iowa-class battleship, with its 20 radar-directed 5\u2033 guns and large array of 40mm and 20mm cannon. Because of their heavy AA firepower, the more advanced US battleships (including the North Carolina and South Dakota classes, armed similarly to the Iowas) were used as carrier escorts. However, they weren't built to be AA escorts - they just got pressed into service in that role. The Atlanta-class light cruisers and the Royal Navy's Dido-class light cruisers were very much built for that purpose. But, the late-war Baltimore-class heavy cruisers had almost as much AA firepower as the purpose-built Atlantas, while still having a main battery of 9 8\u2033 guns. The tradeoff, of course, was that the Baltimores were quite a bit more expensive. So that brings us to \u201cbang for the buck\u201d - and the winner in that category was probably the Gearing-class destroyer: cheap, fast and equipped with essentially half the main battery and fire control suite of an Atlanta-class CL. Granted, that's a late design, but the earlier Sumners were equally capable, and the Fletcher-class only slightly less so. ",

            "answer_text": "The RN Dido class AA cruisers are in the running. They carried 5 dual 5.25\u2033 Turrets optimized for AA work, a large number of 40mm Bofors guns and close range small calibre stuff , and lots of radars. The US Atalanta Class, with 12 to 16 5\u2033 AA guns, and the same Bofors, small calibre and radar was another highly effective AA ship. Technically, many large capital ships had better AA armament, but they often couldn\u2019t act as dedicated AA platforms, unlke these AA cruisers. And including aircraft carriers is just cheating! ",
