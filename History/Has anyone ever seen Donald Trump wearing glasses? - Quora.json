            "answer_text": " Sure.. now you have, too. Like many people over 40\u201350, Trump has some level of presbyopia, so he wears reading glasses to see up close. According to his health exam last week, he sees at 20/30 on the Snellen test, which isn\u2019t perfect, but considered \u201cnear normal\u201d. He can see at 20ft what a normal person can see at 30ft. But good enough to go without eyesight correction for normal daily life. In most states, you must have uncorrected vision at 20/40 or better to get an unrestricted driver\u2019s license. So while that could be corrected to 20/20 or better, he wouldn\u2019t necessarily worry about correcting his vision for distance. Good enough. And Presidents don\u2019t get to drive. ",

I'm not trying to attack, it's just that I've been on youtube and watched the group of guys and girls trying to see whether he can read. But each time he justlooks at the sheet of paper. His eyes do not move, the he volunteers that he hasn't got his glasses! There are a number of flicks on the net though where he is wearing and using them. However when he was looking at the paper there was no effort to read, strange. ",
