            "answer_text": "I can only answer this for myself as I am sure it makes different people feel differently\u2026 so I\u2019ll start with a non-serious answer: It depends on what kind of gun I\u2019m holding. Raven .25 micro compact pistol - Vulnerable\u2026geez, I hope I\u2019m not going to ever have to use this thing.Walther PPK 380 compact pistol - Like 007, but I can't seem to afford the Aston Martin that goes with it.S&W 500 Mag revolver - Like a poseur, but confident\u2026check this thing out!FN M249S belt fed - like Rambo.Glock 19 9mm handgun - like one of those guys with a black suit, sunglasses, and those curly wires coming out from behind my ears.Pump action 12 GA shotgun - Confident\u2026.and I KNOW you heard it go \u201ccha-chank\u201dLol\u2026but seriously, some people say holding a gun makes them feel powerful. After a stressful day, going to a target range helps some blow off some steam. For me, I\u2019m just too cranial\u2026I relieve stress because I start to focus and work on fundamentals, technique, and of course, aways\u2026mindful of safety. It\u2019ll distract me from whatever day I\u2019m having or make it a bit brighter. Hope that answers your question. ",

            "answer_text": "It might feel like getting behind the wheel of a car for the first time. Awesome power at your command and the power to destroy. But you didn't get in the car to destroy did you? Good. If you are a normal thinking person like hundreds of millions of other Americans who own guns you will also feel no sudden urge to commit mayhem with the gun in your hand \u2014 nevertheless, you will know that power is there and that you had BETTER respect it. Learn, and make a personal mantra these Four Rules: Always treat a gun as if it is loaded at all times\u2026 even when you think it isn't.Never point a gun at something you are unwilling to destroy. Not even as a joke.Do not put your finger over the trigger until you are pointed at your target and are about to fire. Your finger has no business being within the trigger guard if you are not shooting.Be sure of your target AND what is behind it. Do not shoot at a target you have not definitely identified \u2014 a shadow in the hallway may not be the threat you think it is. Get a light. Bullets go through things \u2014 will the wall behind your target stop a bullet? Or will the person behind your target stop it?",
