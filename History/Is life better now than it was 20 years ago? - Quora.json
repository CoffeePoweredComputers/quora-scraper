            "answer_text": "In some ways yes and in many other ways NO! In 95\" I was 21 and it was overall a very peaceful and fun time. The music was much better, the economy was better, it was before 9-11 and ISIS hadn't become this horrible machine of terror. There was blessed ignorance here in the USA. The twin towers had survived an explosion in the winter of 1993 and Bin Laden was rubbing his hands together, planning. But in 95\" we were sitting with a \"blanket over our heads.\"Life certainly felt much more carefree. With the lack of Internet (most folks didn't have it) and cell phones, yes, life was much simpler! No online shaming and bullying. The lack of the technology we \"depend\" on now in 2015 resulted in true relationships and a great deal of fun. We never knew what would happen. One night an impromptu trip to a covered bridge, Chinese fire drills, hanging in folk's driveways until 2. Skinny dipping and then watching the golden melon sunrise from a lawn chair. Deep deep conversations,  holding an analog phone in my hand and falling asleep with it while talking with my boyfriend, no quick texts. Working hard all summer for college and road trips. No looking down at a phone whilst creating \"a life\" on social media. We were more aware, more in the moment and breathing and sucking in the world around us. Life was more spontaneous and exciting and less scheduled and planned to the zenith. I made closer friendships. The food was better. Saturday Night Live was better. There were stores 20 years ago that have gone out of existence and that I miss very much! There was certainly more stuff for kids to do back then before video gaming, Netflix, smart phones, and the lack of safety I feel in the world now, what with all these public shootings. Most of all? Everything is just a much too PC!!!!        ",

            "answer_text": "Answer is pre-COVID :) I remember not having a car in 2005 in San Francisco Bay Area. I used to take public transport to and from work. Initially, it involved a 3 hour commute from Mountain View to San Francisco, which was a combination of a 5 minute walk, bus ride, caltrain, bart followed by an uphill 1 mile walk. All the commute instructions had to be printed out and if you missed one bus, you had to painstakingly check the schedule book listed , or carry one . Ipods were affordable but not very common and the 3 hour commute was mostly reading, or doing nothing. Phones had no tethering, no apps and the best game you could have played was \u201csnake\u201d . The time spent in transit was mostly wasted, reading was fine, but there was no way in which you could check or respond to emails, at the most you could do some offline coding. Life is certainly better now :) ",
