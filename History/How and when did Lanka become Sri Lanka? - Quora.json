The actual, but not the official capital of the country is the city of Colombo. The official capital is the city of Sri Jayavardenepur-Kotte The name \"Colombo\" comes from the Sinhalese \"kola-amba-thota\", which means \"mango harbor\".

            "answer_text": "According to the 1815 Kandyan Convention the original name of the country was \"Sinhale\"(in local language) or \"Ceylon\" (The Englishman's pronunciation of Sinhale) at the colonial time.  The name \"Sri Lanka\" was announced in the Sri Lankan Constitution of 1972 at the time of the president William Gopallawa. The most probable reason for this in the point of my view is Sinhalese are the majority of the country at the time and the name \"Sinhale\" or the \"Ceylon\" will express the ownership of the country to one ethnic group. So based on the concept of \"multi ethnic society\" the name may have been changed to \"Sri Lanka\".  Check Ancient Names of Sri Lanka to find more historical names for Sri Lanka. ",
