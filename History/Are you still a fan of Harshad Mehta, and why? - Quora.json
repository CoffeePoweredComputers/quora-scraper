            "answer_text": "Trust is the most expensive things and you can\u2019t expect it from cheap people. I am reading articles on him, watched his so called biopic by SonyLiv, and researching about him. After consuming so much information about Harshad Mehta. A lot of people call him Scamster (Scam word was introduced by Sucheta Dalal and she\u2019s written books with the same name), Defrauder, and some call him genius, brilliant, etc. I am very much convinced that: He was the Big Bull that means he had access to lots of funds which he used to manipulate the stock prices of the targeted company. He invests heavily in a particular company due to this the price of the stocks would increase and then he would sell them at the highest price to maximize the gains.He understood the game of stock market early as a jobber. He started using the inside information of the companies\u2019 to again gain more profits. He made good connections with the companies\u2019 staff and other members.He was a liar. He promised to deliver the profits but when the stock market crashed he failed to deliver his promises. In the process he himself suffered huge loses.He crushed the faith of people in him and misused the loopholes there is not only Harshad Mehta that was involved in the Scam but also the people who were in and running the system were involved in it.He used the flaw of the system in the big way possible. Everyone was doing it but he did it bullishly.Some Good Qualities that I admire in Harshad Mehta (before he started the scam): He had an entrepreneurial mindset. It seems that he was always busy doing research about companies and building good connections.From being a middle class family he dreamed big and almost accomplished his dreams but the end of the chapter was unbelievable.He believed in his risk theory and sometimes it worked for him. The biggest risk is taking no risk at all. He dreamed big because starting small is as risky as Big.Harshad Mehta was a great story teller, Communicator, and knew how to promote his business and his reputation.He was such a talented man that in just one year he became one of the best jobbers in the Dalal Street.He faced a lot of troubles from losing ten lacs to account suspension to starting business in the money market but he managed to find a way. If there\u2019s a will then there\u2019s a way.At the end Money can be a poison and everyone wants some rest and some Peace. Note: I don\u2019t know him personally and all the information I shared in this answer is based on my perception and knowledge. So I don\u2019t claim that the information is 100 % true and he\u2019s not a scamster. But I must say that every coin has two sides it depends on you which side do you see. A lot of love for you, support for your journey, and respect for your time. Nitesh Sharma (Focusedreaders ",

            "answer_text": "Yes ,I am still his fan despite of being aware of the fact that he was a scammer and destroyed many people including himself. There are multiple reasons why I am a fan of Harshad Mehta. He was not a genius just little smarter than others around him.Many people think that he was a genius in Market analysis but guess what he wasn\u2019t.Harshad was just a expert business man with great convincing power.If go into Harshad\u2019s journey into stock market , He convinced his employer to give him Job , then he convinced Labor union leaders to help him manipulate stocks , then he convinced Ketan Parekh and made his first chunks of big money to establish Grow more in which carried out his other scams , He convinced bank managers/employees/brokers/companies to participate in his business and the list goes on. The reason for Harshad\u2019s success was not his market analysis it was his convincing power.He taught me -\u201dNever settle is just a bookish thing sometimes settling for what you have can save your life\u201dHe taught me - \u201c Risk hai to isk hai\u201d (Translation \u201c If there is risk then there is love\u201d)Saving your skin will lead you nowhere.",

            "answer_text": "See I have read books and off course watched series scam 1992 on harshad mehta. He was a intelligent person and a good businessman but 1 thing he didn't understand and many people don't understand that where to stop. When you are getting success you do more and more to get more and there you make some mistakes like harshad did borrowing 500 crores like SBI is a harshad's own company. He didn't given BR SGL and other things, this was his biggest mistake and his rivals cornered him at that mistake. Ideally no one can say I am a fan of Harshad Mehta because He did Wrong things to become rich quickly. His overambicious caused what he was after 1992. But there are many things to take from him Hard workCourageFocus and constant thinking of businessTaking good decisions (i am only talking about good decisions taken by him)And many more. ",

            "answer_text": "I will not say I'm his fan because people interprete it wrong but yeah I can say a thing there are a lot of good things which we all can learn out of him like Always follow you passion he didn't left Bombay untill he became a market personStay strong: Harshad seen a lot of Ups and Downs in his Entire career but he remained strong and never lef the stock Market.Stay hungry: Although Harsad was not an IITian of MBA guy still he has a good knowledge of financial and financial market.Explore new opportunities: When Harshad Heard about volume of money market he started learning and exploring entire market to make his grip.Think out of box: Harshad was not born with silver spoon but his hunger for success and Money force him to think differently and he did it well. He find loopholes in system and find a source of Money from banking to stockmarket.Disclaimer: I never support and fraud or scam or any kind of Unethical practices which can hurt our people and country but I believe every bad person also have some good traits in it.
