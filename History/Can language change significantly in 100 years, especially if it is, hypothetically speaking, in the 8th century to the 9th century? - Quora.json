            "answer_text": "I think the answer depends on what you mean by \u201cchange significantly.\u201d For example, consider the Swedish language, cited as an example in Christopher Barnes's answer, as described in more detail in Swedish language - Wikipedia. In Early Old Swedish, nouns, adjectives and pronouns had four cases and three genders. Contemporary Swedish has two cases and two genders. I would consider that a significant change, but it took more than 100 years. In the 100 years beginning in the last decades of the nineteenth century, there was a cluster of what I would call minor changes. Spelling was standardized. Pronunciation was influenced by spelling. Plural forms of verbs disappeared. There were other slight changes in syntax. Class distinctions in the use of the second person pronoun were abandoned. Would these changes add up to a significant change? It\u2019s hard to say. The question refers specifically to a hypothetical interval of 100 years from the eighth century to the ninth century. It\u2019s hard to answer the question in that context, for two reasons. First, the only evidence of what the language was at a given time is written texts, and there aren\u2019t a lot of surviving texts from that time. Second, texts were written in different dialects, and the difference between different dialects at the same time can be greater than the changes in the same dialect in a hundred years. It\u2019s hard to tell whether the difference in language between two texts is due to different dialects or different times. Can language change significantly in 100 years, especially if it is, hypothetically speaking, in the 8th century to the 9th century? ",
