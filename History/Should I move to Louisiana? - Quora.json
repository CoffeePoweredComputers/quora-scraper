            "answer_text": "Louisiana is a very diverse state. We have a population of all nationalities, all religions. We are NOT uninformed, uneducated people. Our winters are usually mild with bouts of cold weather, it could be warm for weeks and then a cold snap will hit and it is cold. Summers are hot and humid. It is a humid state especially in southern part. Louisiana is steeped in traditions and the culture of long ago. There is always something to do and festivals galore. What part of the state you are thinking about moving to you will need to do some research as there is at least four different regions that may suit you. For example, living in the Northwest part of the state will give you a different experience than living in the Southeast part of the state. I will stop here as Mike Halphen gave all good reasons and I would just be repeating his answer. As to colleges\u2026 research is your friend. Here are the top 5. There are also 13 community and technical colleges, offering associate's degrees, technical diplomas and industry-based certificates.

            "answer_text": "I was born in Jackson, Mississippi, less than 200 miles north of New Orleans, LA. My family took vacations in New Orleans a few times every year and I decided at a very young age that I would move there as soon as I could. My parents would always stay in hotels within the French Quarters and when they would go to Pete Fountain\u2019s and Al Hirt\u2019s shows (considered adult entertainment), they\u2019d drop me off at Preservation Hall Jazz club on Saint Peter Street. I would sit for hours on end at the feet of the world\u2019s most famous Dixie-Land musicians, enjoying the music that helped make New Orleans a mecca for music. When I turned thirteen, the musicians would often send me across the street to a bar for adult beverages\u2026no bartender would question me when I told them the drinks were for Sweet Emma\u2019s band members. Not long after graduating from high school, I moved to New Orleans where I lived for thirty-three years. I met and married my wife there and we had a double-shotgun house (living on one side, renting out the other) near City Park. We moved away from New Orleans in 2009 and headed to Seattle, WA to be closer to her parents and relatives. I\u2019m in a constant state of home-sickness, as nowhere else compares to the amazing history, culture, architecture, people and food. ",
