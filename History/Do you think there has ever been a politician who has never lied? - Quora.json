(Actually, Jesus is the only one who never lied, but then He was both God and Man, so He had an advantage.) Since politicians are people with egos who are subject to political scrutiny and prefer to make themselves look good to their constituents, even when some decisions they have made may be questionable, they are highly tempted to make themselves look good and their opponents look bad. So, even if they don\u2019t out and out \u201clie\u201d they likely have twisted the truth to their advantage. ",

            "answer_text": "Question: Do you think there has ever been a politician who has never lied? Short answer is NO. Long answer: All politicians lie, but you can have politicians that lie so little that it becomes a none issue. Historically Abraham Lincoln and George Washington were known for being very honest. If you look at current politicians, you could say Bernie Sanders is honest, you might not agree with his solutions, but he is honest about what he wants. Obama was also fairly honest, but for me he is on the border of what I would call an honest politician. Lately American politics have turned rather ugly and partisan, so it is difficult today to point at a truly honest politician. So in conclusion you should not worry so much on IF a politician lies, but more on HOW MUCH do they lie. ",

Carter thinks very carefully about what he says and doesn\u2019t pull any punches. He is a man of deep religion, and it matters to him that he is in integrity. ",

It\u2019s pretty much impossible for humans not to lie, even once, we all have slipped up in this regard. Political Life: All politicians promise things that they know they can\u2019t deliver on during campaign season in order to win the votes of the state they\u2019re campaigning in. Some politicians want to do what\u2019s best for the country and fail in one or two terms to bring to pass what they claimed they could. And some politicians have no plans on doing anything that they said they would. ",
