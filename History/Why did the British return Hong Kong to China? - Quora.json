            "answer_text": "Why did the UK want to give back Hong Kong? Wow the \u2018want to give back\u2019 part makes the UK sound altruistic. Some people contend that HK was always part of China and do not recognize the British rule as legitimate. But to answer your question, the reasons are economic: HK became such a financial burden for the UK that it was just suicidal business to continue governing it; the UK essentially was giving the mainland free money; the HK (unlike Taiwan) is actually physically connected to the mainland so HK is technically already part of the mainland;non-HK mainlanders did the most business with HK anyways, not the British;and as mentioned the PRC could easily cut off HK from the rest of China and the world;this was also around the time of the Asian financial crash, which really hurt HK (the rest of China less hurt), so selling back to the PRC to take care of it was just practicalso HK was not giving enough back to the UK to be useful to thempolitical: the UK realised how valuable of a training partner China (excluding HK) was; and in order to conduct business, they had to acquiesce by handing back HK; the Chinese market matters a lot more to the UK than the UK to China; and the HK re-unification did improve Sino-Britain relations in the long run, even if some remain bittersocial: HKers do not like being colonised or ruled by the British; they never did and nobody colonised ever liked British colonisation; especially for cultural and ethnic reasons; as mentioned colonialism is bad PR to a declining UK (not the old power it once was); HK was also making the UK unpopular among their own population; nowadays the UK just would not be able to manage it, especially since it is more preoccupied with Brexit and other populist crisesSo given the weight of these factors, it is actually somewhat surprising that the PRC made any concessions in the return of HK\u2014that is, the Sino-Britain treaty. The PRC is still working on gradually reintegrating HK, perhaps for better as a sudden change may have triggered too much of a resistance. But the HK dollar is still pegged to the US, HK uses a separate currency, and it has its own laws. This is changing though\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "It depends how \u2018deep\u2019 and back in time we really want dig into. I\u2019ve written about this extensively and some details may come as a surprise. The year 1943 should be the starting point. I learnt about this just after my marriage in 1977 through my Auntie Babs, who was a British diplomat and foreign-service officer in the Far East during World War II. She\u2019s the one who was on-site in the month-long horror of the Nanking Massacre in the winter of 1937. Grandma told Auntie B. to get me \u201cread-in\u201d on some of the \u2018hidden\u2019 history of world politics and war. Auntie B. said she couldn\u2019t because that would contravene the Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1920. However, Auntie B. got me onto this 1943 matter because it wasn\u2019t a state secret though it was fairly well hidden from public knowledge. The UK decision to ultimately return Hong Kong to China began with this virtually unknown Sino-British treaty:\u2014 The Treaty on the Relinquishment of Extra-Territorial Rights in China [Treaty Series No. 2, 1943] (\u201cRETRIC\u201d) \u2014 also known as the New Equal Treaty \u2014 signed between the UK and the Chinese governments in Chungking (Chongqing) on 11 Jan. 1943 and registered with the United Nations predecessor on 30 Sept. 1944 as Treaty No. 4826)I just lurve it to read or hear lots of people over the years keep talking about Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon peninsula being \u201cceded in perpetuity\u201d to the UK since 1842 and 1860 and the New Territories sovereign leasehold of 1898 expiring in 1997, and all that jazz. That doctrinal position went down the toilet with RETRIC in 1943. The UK as a matter of political principle already positioned itself to give up Hong Kong whenever and however China asked for the place back. The only difference was China never bothered to ask for it back until the 1980s. The UK knew full well of its extraterritorial rights in China (or lack thereof) \u2014 the UK was (and still is) very expert in land law, and the matter of Hong Kong was land law if you tease away the political parts from it. Plus the UK formally recognised the People\u2019s Republic of China as \u201cChina\u201d in 1950 in order to keep running Hong Kong \u2014 because the place served the interests of practically everybody who needed to be served. So when the Hong Kong question finally erupted in the 1980s, Auntie Babs told us young mutts in the family that:\u2014 Beijing probably didn\u2019t start off knowing much about RETRIC for the Sino-British talks \u2014 but \u201cthey could bloody well hire English lawyers too, you know\u201d to get to grips with RETRIC and use it as political leverage.The two sides would \u201coperationalise\u201d (Auntie B.\u2019s word) their negotiation positions and do the tango for 10 years to sort out the nitty-gritty of the handover.The UK would create some kind of new nationality status for Hongkongers to take over the switchover happening from 1981\u201383 from \u201cCitizens of the UK and Colonies\u201d (CUKC) to \u201cBritish Dependent Territories Citizen\u201d (BDTC) in order to accommodate China\u2019s doctrinal needs.Leave the Hong Kong strategic treasury reserves (money!) intact and not repatriate them to the UK \u2014 because Beijing already knew the UK by policy don\u2019t do things like that since the failure of the British North American Acts in the 1760s\u201370s.In the lead-up to the treaty called the Sino British Joint Declaration in 1984, it should not reference anything about RETRIC because that would be tantamount to accepting the legitimacy of treaties entered into with foreign powers by \u201ca\u201d Chinese government (i.e. KMT) that the Communist Party doctrinally regarded as having no legitimacy anyway.As you can see, Auntie B. seemed to have been right on all scores. It\u2019s not for nothing that she was awarded the CBE \u2014 Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire \u2014 for British diplomacy and \u201cAllied service.\u201d If we prefer not to believe the foregoing, then that\u2019s all fine with me. Then you\u2019ll just settle on the media-driven picture that the place belongs to China, that China could just shut the water taps and hang the place out to dry, and could deploy at least 120,000 PLA troops within 72 hours if the UK refused to hand back. That works just as well as an explanation, now that the matter is ancient history anyway. Postscript:\u2014 We did ask Auntie B. whether she was present at the RETRIC signing. All she ever kept telling us was, \u201cI may have been in another life if all things went as well as they should\u2019ve been.\u201d That\u2019s a very precise and forceful non-answer, don\u2019t you agree?
