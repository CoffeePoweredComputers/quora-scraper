            "answer_text": "European Union will support Greece. \u201cWe (the EU member states) are clear and determined in defending the European Union\u2019s interests and solidarity with Greece and Cyprus. Turkey has to refrain from unilateral actions. This is a basic element to allow the dialogue to advance,\u201d EU top diplomat Josep Borrell said. Germany, Italy and Malta are the more cautious about slapping sanctions on Turkey, according to diplomatic sources. Those countries reportedly expressed fears that Turkey could retaliate by releasing towards Europe the four million of migrants currently held on its soil, but without any doubts German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said EU countries have an obligation to support Greece and Cyprus. The Chancellor added that she had already discussed the dispute between Athens and Ankara \u201cintensely\u201d with French President Emmanuel Macron, Sputnik reported. Diplomats say France and Austria have adopted the toughest stance against Turkey. Paris has already sent warships in the region, while Vienna asked once again for the official end of Turkey\u2019s EU accession process. Turkey defies EU ultimatum, threatens with war Merkel Says All EU Countries Have Obligation To Support Greece Against Turkish Aggression - Greek City Times If turkey keep this atitude all this could escalate into an actual military conflict\u2026Look how easy the thinks could be very dark\u2026for all, not just for Turkey or Greece. If for some reason Turkey attacks or invades some Greek territory, immediately the eu-battlegroups will be triggered to help and protect the Greek people. That's what they were created for and they exist today. It has nothing to do with Nato nor need Nato for anything. EU Battlegroups are multinational, military units, with at least 1500 personnel each and form an integral part of the European Union's military rapid reaction capacity to respond to emerging crises and conflicts around the world. The European Union Battlegroup is the EU's Rapid Response Force and can be deployed in a radius of up to 6,000 km around Brussels. The EUBG concept forms the basis for the EU's rapid crisis response and is intended to ensure the strategic independence of the European Union. They permit the EU and its Member states to respond early and rapidly to evolving conflicts. Preventing conflicts and engaging at an early stage is more efficient and effective than engaging at a later stage in fully fledged violent conflicts. In conjunction with a reliable early warning system, EU Battlegroups permit a targeted and rapid response to minimise human suffering and insecurity. In a world of predictable unpredictability, reacting fast is at times the only way to react effectively. While Member States remain in the driving seat and are responsible for deploying security and armed forces when needed, the EU can facilitate and reinforce this cooperation and make the collective effort more effective. Ensuring a joined-up and comprehensive approach which makes full use of all the EU's available instruments and acts on all stages and levels of the conflict is essential to achieve a lasting resolution of violent conflicts and crises. EU Battlegroups If things happen now in the second half of 2020 the european union has two battle groups in stand by that and other sixteen Battlegroups ready too.

            "answer_text": "Greece is a peaceful nation, we don\u2019t support war especially with allied powers, the only time Greece will go to war with Turkey is if Turkey attacks us first BUT! the North Atlantic Treaty (the treaty on the formation of NATO) states on Article 5 that: \u201cAn armed attack on one member state is an attack on all\u2019\u2019 which means that if Turkey dares to declare war, Greece has the right to invoke article 5, and then Turkey will be at war with 29 countries instead of just one. Also, Greece, as a member of the EU is also protected by another 6 non-NATO countries so that raises the number of allies to 35 (Based on the Treaty of Lisbon: Mutual Defense Clause). Also, Turkey\u2019s relations with Russia couldn't be described as the best, so another possible ally is Russia cause they wouldn\u2019t let Turkey control the Eastern Med. Then Russia is a member of the CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organization) in which Armenia, a neighboring country of Turkey is also a member of. Then we have the EastMed Gas Pipeline, why this is important? Because in the agreement, there is an article which states that \u201cthe pipeline shall be protected by any means\u201d which also means by the military. So this means that Turkey will also have to face Israel, a tiny nation yet one of the strongest. So tell me, please, would Turkey really risk a world war with 42 strong nations? ",
