Never again would the monarch pretend to hold absolute power and the Bill of Rights 1689 became one of the most important documents in the political history of Britain (and later the developed world). The philosopher John Locke praised the Glorious Revolution in his Two Treatises on Government (1689), arguing that if a government does not protect the natural rights of its people, namely life, liberty and property, it can rightly and lawfully be overthrown. Locke's praise of the Glorious Revolution helped to inspire both the American and French revolutions.

This massive social change also was behind the Industrial Revolution in Britain only and nowhere else in the world. The modern day British society continues to lead the world till date, in being least herd based. ",
