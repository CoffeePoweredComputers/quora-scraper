            "answer_text": "King Henry VII was the first Tudor monarch of England. He had two sons and two daughters. First son was Arthur, Prince of Wales, who died aged 15, married to Catherine of Aragon, but with no children. Second son became King Henry VIII. He had three children who survived infancy, and all of whom became monarch: Queen Mary (daughter of Catherine of Aragon), Queen Elizabeth (daughter of Anne Boleyn) and King Edward VI (son of Jane Seymour). None of these children had any children themselves, and the last of these to die was Queen Elizabeth. So the succession passed through his first daughter, Margaret, who married King James IV of Scotland. So she ceased to be a Tudor and became a Stewart instead. While England was running through the Tudor dynasty, James IV and Margaret had a son who became King James V of Scotland. King James V had one legitimate child who survived infancy, Mary, who became Queen of Scots at the age of 6 days (on her father\u2019s death). Mary also became Queen Consort of France for a short time, and had a claim to be Queen of England and Ireland as well (if you consider that Queen Elizabeth\u2019s claim was improper). From Mary Stewart\u2019s three marriages she had one son, James, who became King James VI of Scotland at the age of 1 year when Mary abdicated. Later, when Elizabeth died, James VI was recognised in England as the next heir, and became King James I of England as the first Stewart monarch of England. But, although he was a Stewart, he had Tudor blood in him from his great-great-grandfather King Henry VII. ",

            "answer_text": "The last living legitimate heir of King Henry VIII was a girl, who later on turned to be the greatest queen England would ever have, Queen Elizabeth I. She never married, thus no male/female heir to continue the legacy of the great Tudor dynasty. With Elizabeth\u2019s end, the Tudor dynasty came crumbling to it\u2019s end. ",
