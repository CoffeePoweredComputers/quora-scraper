            "answer_text": "A little bit of historical context before I plunge into answering your question. Dark Age Italian scholar, Petrarch coined the term Dark Age to describe the period that ensued the fall of the Roman Empire. The period, according to him and his supporters, was Dark because of the decadence of Latin literature as well as a general decline in the cultural and social aspects of the society. Now, this definition was further extended by some historians, claiming that the breakdown of the structure of the Church, the conflict between Islam and Christianity (marked by Muslim conquests), and the lack of humanitarian growth added to the \u2018darkness\u2019 of this era. Historians have abjured the usage of this term because of its negative, and seemingly deceptive connotation. As modern discoveries will tell you, this Age was never really Dark; it was a harbinger for the Italian Renaissance and the Reformation. While the lack of a Holy Roman Emperor to protect and govern the people was felt strongly and mass migrations followed, the lives of people weren\u2019t really as tumultuous and they certainly lead more stable lives than that of people during any other major political upheaval. To answer your question\u2026 If we adhere to the dictionary definition of the Dark Ages i.e. \u201ccharacterized by a lack of knowledge and progress\u201d it is safe to say that we\u2019re not entering one! Our society has seen the cumulative progress of knowledge of more than 2 centuries within the last decade. We have grown to be more aware of our surroundings and have learnt a great deal more about our pasts, and are on the way of building a great future. Hence, by all means we can call our era as an \u201cAge of Enlightenment\u201d, if that is not too presumptuous! However, if you take into account the missing aspect of the definition (of the Dark Age), i.e the rise of political dissent, moral and cultural decadence, and a religious stagnation, we might as well be entering into one! Our society witnessed tremendous political shifts, and world superpowers are operating under the shadows of regimental leaders. Societies have shifted their focus towards building extremely strong economies, thereby foregoing much of their cultural wealth. And lastly, the insurgence of religious extremists like the ISIS, and the extremely precarious situation that they have brought upon the middle eastern lands has caused too much of a concern to the whole of humanity. It looks like we\u2019re at the crossroads of yet another Dark Age. It is for you to decide the direction in which we will now be heading. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a cardinal mistake to use a term, which was coined with a derogatory meaning, for any other period of time. Besides, the original\u201cDark Age\u201d period was not dark. When political turmoil ravaged through Europe, the Eastern Roman Empire held on. They had their internal troubles (to put it mildly), but they continued preserving and developing the knowledge of old. The Franks were not a bunch of sword-wielding barbarians (read \u201cCarolingian Renaissance\u201d), but shaped what was to become Europe. The Visigoths kept Roman culture until a bunch of barbaric Berbers killed it off. Sure, Rome (the city) declined, but the Langobards built a culture of their own. (See Ravenna or Milan for that) Even the rest of the Western Roman Empire held on here and there (visit Burano for that!). If you were thinking of a \u201csecond Dark Age\u201d as consisting tribes choosing to look for a better life with sword in hand (or something to that effect), that\u2019s not going to happen. Too many people to feed, not enough land for that. A mass exodus nowadays is also impossible, because armies don\u2019t depend on a huge number of people anymore. A bunch of Specialists controlling weapon systems is all it takes. It will not be like the days of old. We are entering a time that was depicted in \u201c1984\u201d (the book, not the year!) - only smarter. There is no INGSOC today and there never will be one, because oppression is not necessary to keep us quiet. We all (or most of us) have too much to loose if we kill off the system. So why oppress people when they can do it to themselves? Take away traveling and people will revolt - so let them travel and gain a profit from that. Much better than having to guard millions in camps. The next period will be very different. But it won\u2019t be dark. ",

No this is not may be a Darker Age, but to compare this age to the historical Dark Ages, after considering the fact that we have modern medicine, semi-stable politics and much more would be ludicrous.
