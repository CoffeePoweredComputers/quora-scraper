            "answer_text": "Yes. Over the years, we\u2019ve downsized our Christmas tree to a tabletop size. We get a fresh one every year\u2014and they\u2019re hard to find, btw. We\u2019ve gotten them at Whole Foods, and two years ago started getting nicer ones at a local nursery. We put mutti-color lights one it and a small star on top (that I have attached to a chopstick I painted green one year, and tie it onto the tree with a green twistee). We still have our family ornaments, collected over the years, but we no longer use them. We get our tree in mid-December, or a little later, and are able to enjoy it until the 12th Day of Christmas, i.e., Epiphany. And fwiw, we celebrate a minimal Christmas at our house. And we consider it a secular holiday\u2014the season and the day itself. My husband and I are empty-nested and retired, though we are involved with some non-profits. With the pandemic going on, we work with those remotely and socially distant. So we hope we won\u2019t be pushed by family into getting together inside for Christmas the way we usually do. Still, it\u2019s hard to say no to something so important to others. Anyway, we want our tree just for us to enjoy. ",

We buy items throughout the year as needed. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f We both miss celebrating Christmas, but as we are approaching retirement age, we have cut back on many frivolous purchases. We have two 4 year old cats that have never experienced the Christmas tree. I\u2019m not sure if that is good or bad! \ud83e\udd23. We DID downsize to a 4-ft pre-lit tree, but have yet to erect it at Christmas. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f To answer your question, we probably won\u2019t set up a tree this year, as we would like to move as soon as my husband gets a new position.

Almost all of our shopping will likely be online and shipped directly to recipients, so that\u2019s less time shopping and wrapping, more time to soak up the ambience of our home. ",

At my age, I owe myself an indulgence of beauty and a reminder of why we have Christmas at all. Most folks seem to forget the reason for the season\u2014it\u2019s become a season of commercialization, and that\u2019s so unfortunate. As a reminder to anyone who cares: Commerce did NOT build this event even though it takes advantage of the main event. Had it not been for Christ, it is doubtful that man would be here at all. ",

I am thinking of doing takeout from a restaurant for Christmas dinner. In other words, we do a secular celebration. ",
