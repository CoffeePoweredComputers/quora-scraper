            "answer_text": "There are hardly any markers which say that the British would not have left India. The British never believed in cultural assimilation like other powers (Spain, France, Portugal). They hardly married with the local population and hence were clearly seen as people who were carrying of India's wealth to England. They did not practice inter marrying even in the NE of India where they had converted most of the people to Christianity. They also had the idea of the 'white man's burden' and believed in a civilizing mission. If instead India had been ruled by Portugal or Spain who followed the policy of intermarriage, Indians would have never revolted against them. This is because India was used to assimilating invaders from different parts of the world. At the same time even a neighbouring village could be considered an enemy. That is the reason why we never saw the Moguls as invaders before the British era. We would have called the British as 'settlers' and not invaders or colonisers. It would have been a situation like South America were natives and settlers have become one. In the worst case scenario it would have been like North America (US, Canada) where the native population was wiped out. In fact we were lucky since the white settlers to North America were actually searching for India and had accidentally settled in their 'New Found Land'. That is why the native Americans are still called 'Indians'.On the other hand if Portuguese had ruled over India, we'd probably become like Goa where the people do not really hate the Portuguese. Instead they still use Portuguese passports as a passage to the EU. The same goes for Northern African nations and France. On the other hand the British even recently changed their citizenship laws when Hong Kong became independent to prevent people from Hong Kong moving to Britain since they were of a different race.A comparison with countries like Australia, Canada etc. like some others have done is wrong. This is because these are Anglo-Saxon nations and still follow racial policies. Even today the NSA leaks by Snowden shows that these nations prefer racial solidarity and created the 'Five Eyes Group' which consisted of US, Australia, UK, New Zealand and Canada. Democracy or any shared culture does not make sense in these cases. Considering that they have still not changed their mentality, it is futile to think that the British would not have had to leave India with such a policy. ",

            "answer_text": "If British was still in power, India would have been something like this:- 1) First thing first, there would not have been a President as the head of Indian state, rather a Governor general or viceroy (a person with British origin) would have been the supreme authority. 2) India would not have been the 'world's largest democracy' 3) There would have been almost no place for India in bureaucracy or diplomacy. 4) Pakistan would have been a part of India. 5) There would have been no issues related to Kashmir. 6) The Indian states would not have been divided into linguistic basis. Rather the legacy of Princely states would have prevailed 7) We still don't find any probability of a war between India and China but if India was in the hands of Britain, an Indo-China war would have surely happened 8) British would have never given Indians the unique \"Freedom of speech\". This means, India would have been free from anti-nationals or pseudo nationals who have left no stone unturned to misuse this unique right. 9) Journalists like Barkha Datt would have never flourished. 10) There would have been no 26/11 attacks. 11) There would have been mass illiteracy and lack of education. 12) There would have been *even more corruption* as it has been proven that the British Government in India was more corrupt and arrogant than The contemporary GOI. 13) India's economic growth would have been almost null and void. 14) People of India would have no time to debate on topics such as \"Eating beef\", \"Triple talaq\" etc as the only debate would have been the independence of India from foreign authorities. 15) People would not have got an opportunity to pursue a career in Media fields as there would have been no free Indian media. 16) The number of people who lost their lives in Bihar and Assam flood would have been at least 3 times more. 17) The political map of India would have looked different. 18) The Indian National Congress would still have been one of the largest political party. 19) There would not have been any Mars mission. 20) Rakesh Sharma would not have been known as the first person to reach space. 21) India would not have been a democratic society. Rather it would have been a capitalist society. 22) There would have been no subsidy on our day to day essential goods and services. 23) Farmers still would have to pay Lagaan and therefore, the rate of Farmer's suicide would have been much more higher. 24) There would have been no international significance of India. 25) A large number of indian youth would have been involved in agrarian activities. 26) women would have been more unsafe in India. Cases of sexual molestation of women would have never been lodged. 27) There would have been a large number of bloodsheds and revolts within the last 70 years. 28) Tourism in India for the Indians would have never developed. 29) There would have been a stronger unity between the Hindus and the Muslims. 30) Indian cinema would still have not become a giant industry. 31) The ideas of the educated Indian youths would have been greatly influenced by the culture and norms of Britain. 32) There could have been even more colonial buildings than that we have today. 34) Indian industries would have never developed. 35) India would lack the basic resources as it would have been completely exploited by the Britishers till now. 36) India would still be using 2G networks and there would have been very less technological advancement. 37) Since India was still under the hands of the British, this means two scenario could have existed. (a) There would have been no Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, Government of India Acts, Rowlatt Acts etc. OR, (b) There would have been even more number of colonial acts intended towards the independence of India. 38) Mahatama Gandhi would not have been known as the FATHER OF THE NATION. Infact, he would have never been killed by Nathuram Godse. 39) There would have been no caste based reservation. Rather, the reservation would have been based on Nationality. 40) Shaheed Bhagat Singh would have been regarded as a TERRORIST by the GOI 41) Sports, especially cricket would have never flourished in India. 42) *Indians would be deprived of identity* 43) Yoga would have never received internationl recognition 44) The average life expectancy of Indians would have been relatively less. 45) The rate of Infant Mortality would have been relatively high. That's all I can think as of now. Sorry if I had hurt the sentiments of any individual or group. Thanks. . ",
