            "answer_text": "Note : I collect some of this post who Writing His Opinions about Ottoman Empire . in one post by me . if you fell if I explained so much in one Point you can past it to next one . All Books which we Study it in Schools in Arab World is Mentioned about Ottoman Empire as an Occupation .and the War In 1916 which it\u2019s called \u201cArabs Revolution\u201c with British Interface is victory . Also they mentioned the Ottomans briefly as a period of stagnation, corruption, and lack of investment in development or education by the central government. Far from what we have learned in the history books, the Arabs' view of the Ottomans is still changing and in constant debate. The Management System of Ottoman Empire in Arab World 1516 - 1916 : The Ottoman Turks followed quite pragmatic and realistic policies in the Arab geography. They did not completely abolish the previous administrative structure and accepted the existing codes of law.The properties and foundations remained untouched.The amount of taxes did not changeillegal and excessive taxes were abolished.The Ottomans maintained the existing system in the mountainous regions of Iraq and Lebanoncertain settlements were left to the authority of prominent local families. Closer regions to Anatolia such as Syria and Palestine were directly connected to the central authority through governors and \u2018kad\u0131\u2019 [Muslim judges].Ottomans governed regions such as Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria and Iraq in a more \u2018liberal\u2019 fashion with a more autonomous system.Holy cities such as Mecca and Medina were left to the authority of local sharifs [nobilities].While the Muslim Arabs were free to practice their language and culture, the non-Muslim Arabs were part of the \u201cMillet System\u201dThe status of heterodox communities such as the Druze and Yazidis was a bit more different. The Yazidis were accepted neither as Muslims, nor non-Muslims, while the Druze was affiliated to the Sunni-Hanafi law [closer to the Ottoman system].According to the \u201cCebel-i L\u00fcbnan/Mount Lebanon (1864)\u201d lawbook, the Druze was recognized as a seperate community under the autonomous administration of Cebel-i L\u00fcbnan province [sanjak].These communities always lived under Sunni administrations such as Seljuk, Umayyad, Mamluk, and continued living in the mountainous and rural regions during the Ottoman period as well.The Ottomans did not intervene into their lives as long as they remained loyal to the state. The unhindered bedouin attacks against the state authority was the biggest problem faced by the Ottomans. Another problem was the unlawful acts of some governors and \u2018kad\u0131s\u2019.In Summary, history must be evaluated and written based on the conditions of the era in particular, not fantasiesEgypt; enjoyed a high level of self rule under the Ottomans through the dynasty of the Wali Mohammad Ali. Egypt thrived and prospered under the ottomans, and the modern Egyptian army was basically created and modeled after the Turks by Mohammed Ali, replacing years of rule by the Mamluks. The ottomans (Mohammed Ali) continued to rule through Khedive Ismail, King Fouad, and King Farouq and they were more or less considered as an Egyptian dynasty rather than a Turkish/Albanian one, until the military overthrew the King in the 1952 coup. After the coup most of the schoolbooks and history was re-written to smear the reputation of the Ottomans and the overthrown king, and most Egyptians now have a negative view of the Ottomans as foreign invaders and brutal occupiers .Northern Africa and the Maghreb region : These countries have a generally positive view of the Ottomans. They were ruled somewhat independently and there were many instances of support and collaboration between them and the Ottomans against common enemies and in strengthening their internal governance and protecting them from foreign aggression.n Algeria, the Ottoman Empire was seen a bit positive rather than any other. There are reasons contributed for the positive attitude:- The Ottomans gave Algeria a decent of autonomy like Tunisia.- Algeria was too far away to create any threats for Constantinople- Many revered figures like Hayreddin Barbarossa and Abdelkader el Dzajiri were heroes of both Turkey and Algeria.- People in here have strong impression and acceptance of Ottoman rule.Most Algerians have negative view on French colonial rule rather than with the Turks, but again, it is varied.Tunisia : Ottoman empire is highly regarded in Tunisia, the vast majority here only speak good about the Ottoman empire but to them, the Ottoman empire ended in 1881, the year in which France invaded Tunisia and took it from the Ottoman empire, after this year, there is almost zero or at least a very little mention of Ottoman empire in our books and not much in our talkBut many people\u2019s image of Ottoman empire have been corrupted thanks to the Turkish show Harim Sultan (Muhte\u015fem Y\u00fczy\u0131l), when they hear the word Ottoman, they always think of Sultan/Caliph Sulayman I and also bunch of hot women in Harem but thankfully this image is getting removed from many Tunisians heads by reading historyAnyway, about our history books, we are taught that during the final days of the Hafsid dynasty, the ruler became corrupt and stupid and didn\u2019t care about his country and people were very angry and because of him the Spanish are preparing to invade Tunisia and thankfully Ottoman empire came and ended the Hafsid rule and kicked out the Spanish and secured Tunisia from any foreign invasion, so our history books describes the Ottomans as liberators who brought many good things to TunisiaBut we are also taught that during the Ottoman era, we managed to get an autonomous rule and we were ruled by several dynasties and during the time of the last one, the Husainid dynasty, we were living in a very bad time, we were living like dark ages while Europe is getting more lightened and our rulers have tried to adopt many things from Europe like freedom and science and technology and make reforms and all this didn\u2019t save us from the French invasion but helped us when we got independence, so the Ottoman era wasn\u2019t always happy and there were bad things happenedBut after all, Ottoman empire is still highly regarded among Tunisians and in our history booksBy judge the ottoman era in the Arab states ?what parameters we should use ? [ Education Level , Number of Schools & Universities , Health Developments , Industrialization ] it\u2019s were advance in Turkey / Istanbul and Zero in Arab States . By the 19th century all has changed, the ottoman military was a laughing stock to European powers, and the empire was weakened by corruption and nepotism. Also the global wave of nationalism allowed people to define themselves by something other than religion.Ottoman State structure is a unique achievement of not only Turks or muslims but all the middle eastern cultures. Those who keep bragging about Ottoman period are usually sunni daydreamers who neither know Ottomans nor world history. They think Ottoman Sultans were militants of sunni ideology who acted like todays Saudi wahhabi state; forcing their ideology on others by military means.Ottoman state structure is much more sophisticated. Non-muslim minorities participated in every level of government, probably in higher proportion compared to muslims.Royal guards of the Sultans were Orthodox Armenian soldiers till late 19th century. Trade was mostly controlled by jewish and Greek orthodox minorities. Foreign relations officers were exclusively jewish or christian. About one third of the Ottoman population were non-muslim, which is reflected by the entrance quotas into higher education instutions. ( Royal Medical school, for example, reserved 1/3 of the entrance quota for Greek and Armenian minorities)Sultan Abdulhamid II (reigned betw 1876\u20131909) rejected a parliamentary offer to celebrate the anniversary of the conquery of Istanbul because \u2018\u2019This may hurt the feelings of my orthodox Greek citizens. Because we captured Istanbul from them\u2019\u2019. This event is recorded in the memoirs of the Sultan\u2019s Secretary General (Mabeyncibashi) Halid Ziya Beg.Todays sunni youth has no regard for the feelings of even the other muslim sects, let alone the least respect for non muslim minorities. But they love Sultan Abdulhamid II, who is the most quoted Sultan among the Ottoman lovers. Do they care about the real persona of this sultan?Would Ottomans survive even a decade in the incredible meshwork of Middle East where there are so many different ethnicities and religions, if they acted like sunni fanatics of today?Note : in the Last Arabs [without generalization], 1) Arabs are not capable of evaluating their history objectively. 2) If the countries in the Islamic geography constitute 25% of the global population, and provide only 7% of the global production today, 3) while the total income of 57 Islamic countries is equal to Germany\u2019s domestic income alone, it is not just the fault of the Ottoman Empire. The Lovers of the Ottoman Empire describe the entry of the Ottomans into the Arab lands as Fatah (literally opening), while its haters describe it as an invasion. For the enthusiasts of the Ottoman Empire, the greatness of the Ottoman Empire based on passion and religious zeal, under the pretext that the Ottoman Empire was able to protect the Arab world from the penetration of the Shiite, by confronting the Safavid state of Iran. while The Haters of the Ottoman Empire, the entry of a Muslim people to the land of another Muslim people should not be described as Fatah. The Liberal Arab wing believed that the ottoman rule is responsible for all division s and sectarian conflicts because they never invested in educating the Arab people ,no infrastructure development \u060cnot to mention the marginalization of the Arab areas leaving them vulnerable to any super power interference The Turks blame some Arabs during the Arab revolution and the British interference but did the ottoman caliphate build any school outside turkey ,did they send their doctors to treat the sick outside turkey ",

            "answer_text": "Lebanese people do not have a problem with turkish people today,they love going to turkey and always watch turkish series, but they think that ottomans were unfair for occupying the country for 400 years, not helping Lebanese citizens a lot and not interacting with them like french people did. They killed too many people, and the country was in danger because of them being part of the world war 1 , they did many blockades that made people poorer and hungry , because there was no transactions with other countries and so many other bad things.Even ottomans used to hang Lebanese people in a place in Down Town Beirut, this is why it\u2019s called \u2018\u2019Martyr\u2019s square\u2019\u2019. Ottomans considered them as traitors of the ottoman empire, but those martyr\u2019s were the true voice of freedom. They wanted to liberate them selves and the citizens of more than 400 years of bad occupation. I don\u2019t think that a country\u2019s own citizens should be called traitors when they are calling for freedom. And after the ottoman\u2019s occupation was over, french mandate took place and Lebanon was officially a country. Lebanese people felt the difference between the french and the ottomans. French people helped a lot.they gave lebanon it\u2019s independence finally, they created lots of job opportunities, schools (even during the ottoman empire\u2019s occupation) + french system programs, that we still use till today , hospitals, universities, train stations\u2026. The Lebanese capital \u2018\u2019Beirut\u2019\u2019 became a tourist destination and financial capital, nicknamed \"the Paris of the Middle East\" thanks to its French influences and vibrant cultural and intellectual life.Even though the french mandate lasted for almost only 20 years, (ottomans occupation= more than 400 years), Lebanese people never spoke turkish, but they did speak french and still do. (40% of the population knows french, 70% of the schools are french system schools). They are more influenced by French than ottomans, because they helped a lot and weren\u2019t like the others. So when you do a comparison, you obviously know that lebanese people are not big fans of the Ottoman\u2019s occupation. they are Neutral. We don\u2019t love nor hate them, and we don\u2019t even think about it. ",
