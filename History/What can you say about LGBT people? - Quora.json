            "answer_text": "Wow, prepare for a big answer. Short answer: How do I feel about LGBT people? I really dont care. You are a human, and a member of society. I will not treat you any differently. I might be a little surprised by a transgender, but that's because of societal norms. (You dont normally expect to find a dude who looks like a woman or a woman who you didnt realize is not a dude). Everyone is a child of God and I will love and care for them the same. How do I feel about the concept of being LGBT? I disagree wholeheartedly. Now to the meat of the answer. I will answer using two perspectives: religious and scientific. I will tell you my opinion based off of the facts that I know and the feelings in my heart, along with my own reasoning. First: I have family that contains LGBT people. I do not treat them any differently than I do the rest of the family. No bias here. Scientific reason for disagreeing with the concept of LGBT Gender is coded into our DNA. You either have XX or XY chromosomes. If you have anything else, you are technically a mutant, anaberration, or something similar. You probably have a lot of conditions because of these faulty genetics, so I will not be getting into that mess with this answer. The standard configuration is either XX or XY. The purpose of sex is primarily reproduction. There is no other function for it. If I might hazard a guess, the pleasure that results from sex is probably meant to encourage MORE sex and eventually reproduction will occur. This requires a member of each gender to participate DNA. Each gender has unique characteristics. Male sexual organs are on the outside. Female sexual organs are on the inside. When a Male and female have sex, the Male places his organs inside of the female's organs. It cannot work any other way. I will use some pictures to illustrate my point  Female on the left, male on the right  Sweet sweet lovemaking in action Now, what happens if you try different combinations?  It doesn't fit?  Neither does this! Now, I am not going to get into talking about anal, or other sexual acts because once again sex is primarily for reproduction. Now, what happens if you change the parts? Nothing changes. You are still a Male, or still a female. It is hard coded into every cell of your body. No amount of hormone treatments or surgeries is going to change the fact that your body is that gender Religious perspective We were created as literal spirit Sons and Daughters by heavenly parents. Gender is eternal. Even God has a gender, which is why we call Him Father. Having created us, He wishes that we could be like Him, and so He created a Plan. This Plan involves coming to Earth and being given a body, to grow and learn and to be tested. The tests come in various forms and are meant for us specifically. We are given strengths and weaknesses. We are also given Agency, which is the ability to choose, right or wrong. We do not have the freedom to choose the consequences of our actions, however. Here on Earth we need to follow the example he has set forth and the patterns that he has shown in order for us to return to him someday. The trials we face are not necessarily going to be the same as other people's trials. Some of us are given weakness in the form of pride, some of us are lazy, some are rude and uncaring. Some of us are given sexual weaknesses or addictions to drugs and substances. All of these things are given to us to try to overcome our weakness and become strong. That is the whole point. Overcome your weakness and become strong Now, some of us are given the trial of being attractes to the same sex. This does not make you bad or evil. It means that you are imperfect, like the rest of humanity! Some of us are also potentially born either \u201cin the wrong body\" or believing that they belong to the opposite gender. This is also a trial, and we must overcome all of our weaknesses. It does not make you evil to have these trials. Eventually, after we die, we will be resurrected. We will be given our glorified, perfected bodies. There will be no more weaknesses, and all problems will be resolved. If indeed you were truly born into the \u201cwrong body\", that will be corrected. If it was correct after all, then you will be comfortable in it. I might add more on this later in comments or edits. It feels kinda incomplete, but I'm not sure how to clarify, if needed. This is all my opinion and belief, and does not reflect that of any group. What were the two commandments given to Adam and Eve in the Garden? Multiply and replenish the EarthDo not eat the fruit, or you will dieThe first Commandment has NOT been revoked. It is still in effect. Marriage as intended by God takes place between a Male and Female, lawfully wedded as Husband and Wife. It is an Eternal Principle How do my beliefs affect how I treat LGBT individuals? As a Christian, I have been taught to love everyone. This does not mean I have to accept their actions and choices that I know to be wrong. I do not have to participate in these actions and choices that are wrong, and I will not encourage sin. However, would I be excited for my sister-in-law who would eventually settle down with a nice woman who would treat her with respect and who loves her? Absolutely. Do I treat her any different for being a lesbian? No. Do I agree with her lifestyle? Also no. And now, a message on peer pressure I believe a fair number of LGBT individuals are not actually LGBT. Did you know that if every day, for years, if people continuously told you that you were stupid, you would eventually believe that you are stupid? Did you know that if every day, you told yourself that you will become kinder, eventually you would find yourself becoming kinder? Buddhist prayer beads/necklaces are based off of this. Using it correctly, you end up repeating your mantra about 10,000 times, which I believe in psychology has actually been found to change the brain and the way it thinks. The power of suggestion is immense, and it can affect many aspects of your life. In middle school and high school, the common insult was \u201cyou're gay\". What happens to the kid who, after being told this every day for years? Eventually, they will come to believe it, or experiment and try it and find it to their liking because that is what they have been told to believe. In conclusion There are many reasons why I do not believe in being LGBT, but I do not let it affect the way I treat them. I love them as fellow Sons and Daughters of God, but I disagree with their lifestyle and choices. This does not make me homophobic. It makes me different. It means I have opinions and beliefs that I wish will be respected, as I respect others. If you wish to comment and tell me what you think about what I have said, go ahead. I do ask that you do not be inflammatory and you be respectful of others opinions. I love to hear about opposing views. You cannot have a proper opinion without considering the opposing side or the facts available to everyone. Love you all! ",

            "answer_text": "To preface my answer, I would like to state that I am a transgender male and that I have experienced prejudice and discrimination for trying to be who I am. I agree with the LGBT community for the most part. I am part of the community as stated above and being part of that wonderful group of people has allowed me to become friends with a lot of people and has given me access to a kind and caring set of people who understand my struggles as a trans person and can relate heavily to what I go through on a daily basis. That in itself is a blessing and I am thankful for that every single day. However, there is a side of the community that I disagree with. I\u2019m not going to try to shade my opinion or lessen the blow so to speak because I believe being allowed to speak what I believe is a right that was rightly granted to all citizens of the U.S. There are two groups in the community that I disagree with, one of them being \u201ctranstrenders\u201d and the other being the people who use so-called strange pronouns and the people who get very, very specific with what they identify as. In case you don\u2019t know what I mean by these, transtrenders are people pretending to be transgender for attention and don\u2019t actually experience dysphoria and as for the different pronouns and orientations, I am talking about the people who choose to go by ze/zim pronouns or something along those lines and the people who identify as stargender or other identities like that. I disagree with transtrenders because I feel like they paint the trans community in a bad light and making it seem like all trans people are just transitioning and getting surgery and starting on hormones to get attention from other people. I also disagree with transtrenders because sometimes they go far enough to where they start hormones or even get surgery which is irreversible and end up getting dysphoria from those procedures. They are just causing themselves pain in the end and are spending money on things that they don\u2019t even need and taking away needed resources for actual trans people. Now, onto my opinion on pronouns and identities. I\u2019m not going to stop anyone from using whatever pronouns they\u2019re cool with or identifying with whatever they want to, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t disagree with it. I again feel like these people almost make the community feel like a joke to cis het people(identifying with the gender you were assigned at birth and liking the opposite gender) because they see a gender identity that is being aligned with the stars or the moon or something like that and then end up thinking the whole community believes that nonsense. As for the pronouns, I will use whatever pronouns you want me to within reason, but I feel like he/him, she/her, and they/them is really all that\u2019s needed for the people of all identities in the community. Thank you for coming to my TED talk, the next installment of which is most likely coming within the next month. Stay tuned! ",
