            "answer_text": "First off, the Nazis killed around 17 million, including 3 million Soviet POWS. You appear unaware of the additional 11 million murders so please read about it a little more. There was some very disturbing logic undermining the persecution and murder of 6 million Jews. I would say that the Nazis killed them because they could, and because it benefited the Third Reich economically in the short term. Jews were not popular in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s. Basically it took the Nazis six years of slowly eroding the rule of law and persecuting other minorities (homosexuals & the mentally ill) before they forced the Jews into camps. I wrote a Quora answer on why this was the case, and how the Nazi\u2019s effectively tricked such a large percentage of Germans into going along with their stupid ideas. Everett Criss's answer to How did the Nazi regime trick the German population into accepting the dehumanization of other races and religions? The holocaust was ultimately part of a long term plan, Generalplan Ost, to expand Germany to the east and eliminate the people already living there. This would have resulted in the death and deportation of more than 40 million people. It is my belief that Generalplan Ost was necessary for the continued existence of the Nazis, as the basis for their economic success was not sustainable. Human behavior happens for reasons. The Holocaust happened for racist, opportunistic, and economic reasons. Sick, twisted, self-serving reasons are still reasons.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll give you an interesting perspective on it. I\u2019m sure you know Hitler was the one who started the Holocaust, but what you may not have thought about much before is the fact that Hitler was quite possibly mentally ill. Does this excuse what he did? Not at all. Does this offer a better explanation than plain and simple racism? Yes. Many researchers believe that Hitler suffered from ASPD/ Psychopathy, Bipolar Disorder, and Schizophrenia. It\u2019s probably no surprise to you that Hitler was most likely a Psychopath/ Sociopath, but consider the other two illnesses. The Schizophrenia most likely gave him paranoid ideas that he needed to eliminate that specific race, that they were evil. Bipolar and ASPD most likely amplified these thoughts and caused him to choose to commit mass genocide. Racists do exist I the world, but I don\u2019t see any trying to replicate the Holocaust, I personally choose to believe that Mental Illness was the root cause of his actions. ",
