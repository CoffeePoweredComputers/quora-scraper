            "answer_text": "Christians do exist in Japan, about three million, only 1% of the population. The Japanese, being a very sensible people, are very resistant to superstitions derived from the obscurantist spirit of Judaism. The prohibition on Christianity imposed by the Tokugawa Shogunate at the beginning of the 17th Century, in order to prevent Japan being colonised by Spain as the Philippine Islands had been, was lifted by the Meiji government in 1873. Since then there have been eight Christian prime ministers of Japan. From Wikipedia: \u201cRoman Catholic Hara Takashi \u2013 leader of the 19th government and the 10th Prime Minister. 1918-1921 Shigeru Yoshida \u2013 leader of the 45th, 48th, 49th, 50th, and 51st governments and the 32nd Prime Minister. 1946-1947 1948-1954 Tar\u014d As\u014d \u2013 leader of the 92nd government and the 59th Prime Minister. 2008-2009 Protestant Viscount Takahashi Korekiyo \u2013 leader of the 20th government and the 11th Prime Minister. 1921-1922 1932 Tetsu Katayama \u2013 leader of the 46th government and the 33rd Prime Minister. 1947-1948 Ichir\u014d Hatoyama \u2013 leader the 52nd, 53rd, and 54th governments and the 35th Prime Minister. 1954-1956 Masayoshi \u014chira \u2013 leader of the 68th and 69th governments and the 43rd Prime Minister. 1978-1980 Yukio Hatoyama \u2013 leader of the 94th government and the 60th Prime Minister. 2009-2010\u2033 Have there been any Shinto heads of government in Europe or the United States?

            "answer_text": "No, there is still Christianity there. But they are a small cult of the already small population of religious believers (14%) that reside there. Of that, Christians make up 1.56% and muslims make up .12% (Buddhism and Shinto making up the majority). But it\u2019s not just in Japan. Religion is dying off in many of the countries with outstanding education systems. And that\u2019s a good thing. Do you want people believing things based on absolutely no evidence, or would you prefer to have a civilization of people who are able to think for themselves and look into the facts from a rational standpoint?

And there are two remaining leaders, very old that to make things worse- human nature!- don\u2019t get along with each other. Modern life has succeeded in what persecution and death could not- young people are just not interested in keeping that very particular faith. And it seems that they and their rites will be sadly gone soon. ",
