            "answer_text": "This question is an interesting one. The Roman success and the foundations of its Empire stem from its Republic era. Before Caesar you see a nation that is capable of waging wars on its rivals and being incredibly tough with an ability to bounce back from some truly staggering defeats that would have destroyed other nations. After Caesar and more importantly Augustus (although it's more accurate to say that it started with Marius) Rome became an Imperium and although it lingered on and managed to get to its height of power under Trajan its expansive ability and war making power was never truly the same after. Let's explore some facts - Hannibal killed two of the largest armies Rome ever gathered. In essence his men killed 1/8 of the fighting strength of the Roman nation. Essentially 1 out of every 12 Roman men died during those battles which is a huge amount and yet Rome still bounced back and eventually destroyed Carthage. Hannibal killed some 15,000 men at Lake Trasimene, 26,000 at Trebia and they aren't actually sure how many died at Cannae but it was a lot (anywhere between 60k-80k) and Cannae actually was for a long time the battle with the largest casualty count until gunpowder turned up. That's not even considering that these were pitched battles. Most casualties during warfare happen due to roving detachments - hundreds of little skirmishes between patrols and scouts - cavalry engaging in short sharp raids, a squad raiding a farm etc - these all happen all the time but aren't notable enough to go in the history books. Republic Rome bounced back from this and still won the Punic Wars even against someone who is considered one of the best military minds of all time. You don't see this resilience from Imperial Rome. What you see is a massive era of peace for about 2 centuries with some warfare sure and the armies involved are what we see as the traditional image of the Roman soldier but really you get a massive era of peace (Pax Romana) before everything starts to slowly go wrong before it gets picked up by a few genius rulers towards the end of the 3rd Century before it starts to get steadily eroded before finally dissolving at the end of the 5th century and just becoming the Byzantine Empire being ruled from Constantinople. By that point Rome is dead although it's legacy lives on in the Byzantine Empire. So really Roman military prowess was at its zenith during the Republican era and what happened afterwards was just going through the motions until it fell 450\u2013500 years later. So really the question should be why was Republic Rome so strong and why was Imperial Rome not so strong? So why was Republic Rome so good at warfare? Because of its politics. That's the ultimate answer because everything else stems from that. Republic Rome was a Republic (durr) - people voted. And it's a proven fact that countries with democratic representation systems have notably better militaries than authoritarian countries with no democratic representation. Democratic representation political systems are called large coalitions (authoritarian political systems are called small coalitions in contrast) because all political leaders require a coalition to rule by and it's the size of that coalition and how they operate in an assembly that has some very interesting effects in the society that that political leader is from. In case this is all a bit long-winded I'll simplify massively but understand that Republic Rome was ruled by a large coalition Government (the Senate) and I'll give examples using Republic Rome as a basis and in comparison to the Kings and tribal chiefs that Rome would be facing. To achieve power a leader in a large coalition must deliver policy success to not only his supporters but also the public at large. Civilian policy is usually down to financial needs. Rome had a much more developed civilian infrastructure than its rivals - markets, roads aqueducts etc which also made military logistics easier. By providing universally popular policies Roman policiticians could get more votes. By contrast a King doesn't have to provide policy success to voters just his supporters thus there's no incentive to provide universal policies that appeal to everyone.In an authoritarian regime the military is the police force and does the King's bidding. In democratic regime the military protects the state which is a subtle difference and does the Senate's bidding. For a King no rivals are legitimate which means that the military are part of his ruling class (and thus its effectiveness can fluctuate depending on the ruler). Rome by contrast had it's armies as instruments of state and to protect the senate. They were outside politics and thus its effectiveness did not fluctuate during politically tumultuous times.Large coalition regimes generally emphasize education. It's an easy and popular policy to enact and has good benefits for everyone. Small coalitions don't generally educate people because they become harder to manage or a threat to the regime. Better educated people make notably better soldiers and more importantly officers. Better is that it provides experts who can provide benefits - fortification experts, logistic experts, strategy experts etc. All of that improves the fighting ability of a military. Rome had many examples of extremely gifted, scientifically curious and highly educated people and many of them having significant military careers.Since the military is outside politics it makes a good career for people. Career soldiers are notably better than levied soldiers and when massed in numbers prove much easier to control. By contrast Kings usually have elite guard units with the best equipment who surround themselves with levied soldiers. Whilst those guardsmen will be elite they will be hard to control (they are nobles after all) and have different training - their job is to primarily bully and enforce obedience for the King. Roman soldiers by contrast were there to kill for their country and had trained to that effect. Also since the Roman military is outside politics they can train more. Kings guard units don't train as much because they spend a lot of time bullying their people to enforce the King's commands.Regarding equipment - an easy way for a Roman leader to be voted out was to be responsible for dead soldiers. Dead soldiers tend to have families and those families vote. An easy way to prevent this was to make sure that soldiers had good equipment, knew how to use it effectively and cared for it. Roman discipline regarding their equipment and training was harsh because it saved lives. By contrast Kings would equip their guards with the best equipment but everyone else had to make do. Also going back to point 1 - Rome had a much better system of markets, roads and other stuff like mines, forges and armouries. And going to point 3 they had more educated men so they could make better equipment.Regarding professional soldiers - having expert trainers means that recruitment and training is much easier. Rome had a system by which men would assemble at the Campus Martius and join legions which had a proven track record of success. Rome would churn out legions at this time all with a good degree of basic training and equipment and go on campaign to get practical experience. During the Republic era there was always some conflict or problem that required military solutions thus there was a steady officer corps and professional soldiery. Kingdoms by contrast were dependent on the King and their successes.Morale - Democracies are subject to morale on the home front. Provided they are successful with few casualties a military leader in a democracy can use his better trained and disciplined soldiers to good measure. When a threat rears its head to threaten the state though democracies will fight to the death and spend whatever it takes to survive. Rome suffered many setbacks but defeat would actually stiffen military and civilian resolve not shaken it. By contrast Kings don't have the same resolve - a military setback could start a civil war or cause leading nobles to defect to the enemy for survival. Republic Rome was savaged many many times - by the Gauls and by Hannibal. Rome survived but they didn't. Roman history is littered with examples of divide and conquer when a King would lose an initial battle, see mass desertion of his subjects to Roman territories and then have his successor be a Roman client. Or be assassinated by his successor.Trade - tying in with point 1 is foreign trade. Having sea power and forces to protect it gives additional benefits - transport for men and supplies is easier by river or sea for instance. Additionally merchants are the most valuable source of intelligence outside of deep cover spies. Roman traders operated all over Europe and thus had good information about all the regimes in place. Kingdoms don't have such an interest in trade and thus have less intelligence about their potential foes. Another benefit is that it means better goods - better ore for steel making would have a notable effect on military equipment for example.So as you can see from the above Rome was powerful because of its military and its military was powerful because Rome was a Republic with a representation system. The latter Imperial Rome suffered by not being so democratic - sometimes it was more a constitutional monarchy but even then it suffered from not being a true democratic system. ",

            "answer_text": "Two things. Her core values (both internally and in foreign affairs) and her geographical position. But mostly the former. Yes, the Romans were brilliant at engineering infrastructure, warfare, trade and all that. But so were the Athenians and the Carthaginians. Why then did Rome, first as a republic and then as an empire, prevail for several centuries longer than Athens or Carthage? And what were these core values? The pride of Roman citizens in their culture and willingness to defend their homeland to the death.The openness of Roman society in incorporating foreigners as full citizens.The accountability of her senators, tribunes and even emperors to her people. And the importance of institutions and traditions over men.The reliability of Rome to her friends.The ruthlessness of Rome to her enemies.The other empires had some of these but not all. And even when they happened to chance on having them all, that period didn\u2019t last for long. One by one now, Pride - The Romans had an unshakable belief in the virtues of their society, most certainly when she was a republic and even when she was an empire. And they were prepared to die rather than surrender to invaders. They didn\u2019t just talk the talk, they were prepared to walk the walk. At Cannae in 216 B.C., Hannibal, (arguably the greatest military genius in all of ancient history) obliterated more than half of Rome\u2019s legions in one afternoon (it would be the equivalent today of half a million American soldiers being finished off in less time than it takes to watch two movies of the Godfather series). Yet Rome still would not surrender. He just couldn\u2019t believe it. Rome\u2019s children did actually and sincerely believe that they were exceptional compared to other peoples in their time. And they were not wrong or mistaken in thinking that. Openness - Rome willingly accepted and incorporated other peoples, whether they be from Germania, Britannia, Egypt or Gaul as full citizens. Any person could become a citizen of the greatest empire of its time provided he/she adhered to the rules and values. Even with slaves, the Romans commonly practiced manumission (owners freeing their slaves). Slaves could work and accumulate money and then buy their freedom. Numerous such slaves then prospered as merchants and became rich. Yes, slavery in itself is an anathema to us today but you have to realize just how enlightened that attitude was for a society two millennia ago. Accountability - Roman leaders, whether they be her senators from the patrician families or her emperors, were accountable to her common citizens. There was a strongly conservative streak in Rome with respect for traditional institutions over the will of contemporary men (as men like Julius Caesar would find out at a terrible price!) . And Caesar\u2019s successor, Augustus, unarguably the greatest Roman emperor and arguably the greatest Roman of them all, was remarkably conservative, austere and frugal in his habits. For most of her history, and especially in her heyday, tyrants like Nero or Caligula could not reign for long because compared to other empires, there were multiple checks on power with the emperor being kept in check by the senate, the tribunes and (unfortunately) the Praetorian Guard (which much like the Janissaries in the Ottoman Empire, would start out as the elite guard but eventually play a totally out sized and malignant influence in decision making at the highest levels). But at few (if even any) points was there ever a \u201cSaddam\u201d or \u201cKim\u201d option to just mow down, imprison or massacre Roman citizens en masse if they protested. Even Nero threw open his palace gardens to the common citizens as they lost their homes when Rome burned. And subjects and citizens in every corner of Rome\u2019s dominions got their money\u2019s worth in terms of taxes paid through infrastructure, trade routes and of course, security and protection from the greatest military power on the planet. Reliability - This one is absolutely key. Rome kept her word. If you were her friend and were then invaded, that enemy would have the wrath of the most fearsome military machine of its day fall without mercy upon them. The assurance that this gave Rome\u2019s allies cannot be exaggerated. Even in the worst of circumstances, her treaties and promises were kept to the best of her ability. Hannibal counted on getting the other Italian cities on his side to successfully defeat Rome. It didn\u2019t happen. Even after he defeated army after army sent his way by Rome, even after he sacked and burned Italian cities with impunity, they did not desert Rome or throw their support behind him. Which says a lot about what Rome\u2019s word meant to them. Ruthlessness - This was the reverse side of the coin. Enmity with Rome was eternal. She would come at you, again and again and yet again with all the force she could muster (which was a lot!) until she broke you down and you surrendered. And she often would then show no mercy. In the case of Carthage in the Punic Wars, she burned the city to the ground and not only defeated her enemy but made them cease to exist anymore in the annals of history. It was heartless but correct because like it or not, cruelty often pays in war. And when you then compare the two options held out to you - Option A - Peace with Rome, submit to her and have access to all of that prosperity and iron-clad security. versus Option B - War with Rome and the likelihood of slavery at best and death at worst. Hands up any of those who would pick Option B? Finally, Rome was protected on three sides by sea. And in the north by the Alpine mountains. After Carthage lost her naval supremacy in the First Punic War in the 3rd century B.C., Rome was never seriously threatened by a naval invasion. And that\u2019s a big bloody deal - something that the Athenians never enjoyed, being surrounded in the North and West by great land powers like Sparta, Corinth and Thebes. Finally, as an epitaph, it bears importance to mention that just as Rome rose to dizzying heights and stayed there for so long, through these principles\u2026 She eventually fell (tragically but fittingly enough) because of her leaders and her people abandoning these values, one by one. Her citizens were burdened by enormous taxation in exchange for few services or protection\u2026 Her despots and rulers lost touch with the common Roman citizen\u2026 Her allies could not count on her word anymore\u2026 Her enemies did not fear her wrath anymore. Romans ceased to have any pride because it wasn\u2019t even clear what Roman values were anymore. Until you finally had such uncivilized peoples as the Goths and the Huns, and men like Attila who were midgets in military terms when compared to former enemies like Hannibal or such sophisticated adversaries as the Carthaginians, overrun Rome and bring her down to her knees.
