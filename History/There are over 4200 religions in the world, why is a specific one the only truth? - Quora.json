            "answer_text": "That\u2019s just it, it\u2019s not the only truth. The Truth is that the several world wide religions, that is the Truth!! Adam, Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, Moses, Christ, Muhammad, The Bab and Bahaullah are the prophets of God the messengers of God. They are the revealers of his Will. They have come every one thousand years or so with Gods Will for the time. Times change and what worked for this time doesn\u2019t work at another. An ever advancing civilization is the goal. (((((( Here is one of the cruxes, one of the examples a sign for all. We have advanced and are advancing very rapidly materially but spiritually we are caught in this all consuming fire of hate, one arm is strong and grows greatly every day but the arm of the spirit is decaying and dieing more and more every day. This situation doesn\u2019t allow us to climb out of this pit of death and destruction. One arm can\u2019t do it and it is on the verge of not being capable of holding on and the result is catastrophic!!))))))) Divine educators come in procession. They are revealed progressively and will continue for as long as the world lasts. These holy souls are responsible for giving us Gods Will. The difference in them is the time they came here not one of difference in a rank or as a matter of importance they are a part of the guidance of God given through the manifestation of himself. Do you value your first grade educator more than the 6th grade no we don\u2019t, each grade was crucial to our education. We try to make true one of the Manifestations God is above another. This is where we go very wrong and this causes a viewpoint that destroys, where the common sense view is light upon light!!! God is the creator eternal in the past eternal in the future. He does not leave his creation without the Light for the way. All of the manifestations of God have been given His Truth. We have always had His guidance but have erred greatly in how we interpreted each one of Them. The interpretation of the Word of God is the great mistake we make!! These divine messengers give us Gods Will. The Word of God is given through his Manifestations! They are the word of God. God has no peer, God is beyond us, we can not know God directly we know him by following his Manifestations. ( Our interpretations brings the differences) Truth is one. All truth starts with Love and Justice and finds Peace. We know God through his Manifestations. There are so many religions because we continually interpret his Word mistakenly and this ego says this and this ego says no interpret this way all of a sudden we have thousands of sects. Our egos have caused the turmoil and strife. To kill and say it is in the name of God is the epitome of error. How many have died in the name of religion. We must investigate the truth for ourselves independently and act accordingly. Acting in accord with truth brings Justice. We must have truth to give and get Justice. Once we see what progressive revelation is and accept it the justice that comes from that gives us peace and the way for Carrying forward an ever advancing civilization will be realized. ONCE PROGRESSIVE REVELATION IS SEEN AND ACTED ON WE WILL BE ON THE RIGHT ROAD TO PEACE. PEACE IS FOUNDED ON JUSTICE. JUSTICE IS BASED IN TRUTH. LOVE OF TRUTH WILL BE THE MEDICINE TO CURE OUR SOULS OF THIS PLAGUE OF HATE. Love will shine, no glow, it will glow and the chill of hate be gone. How did we get to such hate!!! ( ?????? What is happening when a five year old or 6 or 7 or 10 or 15 or 19 has to live through bullying and the ones who don\u2019t live through it. Is there a worse existence for any soul regardless of age to live through that hate, But a child is particularly hard to see living through it, the lack of love. Can there be a worse hell, if there is how much worse could it be that a child take their lives to escape its pain!!! Now this example is crushing in itself to think about) This example grows to the all consuming fire of hate that has us on the end of life for all not just the bullied. Everything is in degrees. Now when I think of the young soul being tortured from bullying it\u2019s crushing and paralyzes me, imagine what the child feels!!!!! Not enough light can be shone on this!!!!!!!!!! ALL OF OUR ILLS ARE ELIMINATED BY JUSTICE!! The Manifestations of God are the leaders of us getting into the light of Love , Justice and Peace THIS IS THE BASE OF ALL GOOD!! OK LETS INVESTIGATE THE TRUTH!!! STARTING WITH PROGRESSIVE REVELATION SEEMS GOOD.. UNDERSTANDING IT WILL OPEN THE DOOR TO PEACE!!! Real peace. Enough? No it\u2019s not but I\u2019m out of gas \u26fd\ufe0f NO OUT OF ELECTRICITY SOLAR  New times, more change. Changing for the good, ever advancing!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Why is there only one law in physics for gravity, or any other natural phenomenon that science thinks it can explain? How many variations of it are acceptable without destroying the validity of the true law? God is not loosey-goosey, bowing to every whim of man\u2019s imagination. HE IS WHO HE IS, nothing more, nothing less. He changes not, nor does He diminish His perfection to suit anyone. He will not be defined or put in a box by the ideas of men. The earth\u2019s religions are but man\u2019s ideas about God, some more accurate than others The truth is that His way is narrow, just like the laws of science. It is certainly more comfortable to believe the way is broad and that God is so good that He will overlook the error. To overlook any error, would be to deny Who and What He is and what He has said. There are criminals who think that they will not get caught or if caught the judge will go easy on them because other than that one incident, they have led a \u201cgood\u201d life. But the Judge is obligated to the law so that society can operate sanely and with order. It ultimately has nothing to do with any other thing the person did or did not do. It does not matter if there were 10 million variations of the truth and 20 million variations of a lie. They are all false. We can not defy or change a physical law and we will find out that we did not get away with defying a spiritual one. And why do we make every discussion about religion? Religion means nothing, it is the god of any religion that must be scrutinized and defined, not the religion. False gods hide behind being found out by such discussions of religions. Why can\u2019t we get to the heart of the matter and simply speak of the concepts of god that the various religions have and there will emerge the true God during that discussion if truth is sought instead of beliefs defended ",
