            "answer_text": "As the other answer points out, Spanish people didn't exactly exist yet. What is now Spain was inhabited by Iberians, Celtiberians, some Greeks, some Phoenicians, Tartessians, Basques, and so on. Why were they considered barbarians? Because (with the exception of the Greeks, who weren't viewed as barbarians) they spoke neither Greek nor Latin. Latins had all the same prejudices associated with being a \u2018barbarian\u2019 as we do, but the term was applied according to linguistic knowledge, not sophistication. The first to be referred to as barbarians were the Persians, an arguably far more advanced civilisation than the Greeks of that time. ",

            "answer_text": "The Spanish per se didn\u2019t exist under the Romans. The Visigoths ruled Spain for a while and they were a Germanic group, subject to all the same prejudices as the others. The Celts (Gauls) also had some presence there, so they too were considered barbarians (meat-eating, forest-dwelling, pure wine drinking, non-literate, etc.). But no one referred to Spaniards at the time. ",
