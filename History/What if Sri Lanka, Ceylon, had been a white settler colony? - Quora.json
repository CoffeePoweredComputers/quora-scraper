            "answer_text": "It was a colony at one point.  Colombo, in the time of British rule (Source: Central Bank of Sri Lanka) But Sri Lanka is a tiny island which is not suitable for the growth of many crops the empire wanted to grow in Americas and Australia. We did not have known rich veins of gold, silver, copper, petroleum or other valuable minerals. Our importance came from the location at the center of two maritime routes, spices, ivory, pearls and gemstones. Besides our social structure was a centralized one, with a sovereign king, ministers, local rulers and people unified instead of scattered in to tribes. Sri Lanka had long been exposed to Europeans by the time British came along. Plus the Kandyan nobles surrendered to the Empire under a treaty, not by a complete military defeat. Battles were usually fought in wilderness where the foreign armies had to fend off guerilla attacks as wells as malaria-carrying mosquitoes. So it wasn\u2019t easy, economical or logical for the colonists to completely wipe us out. Instead they followed the strategy of \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d playing on the frictions between various groups inside the country so that they may never unite against the common enemy.

If it became a colony though, I suppose I\u2019d be living in a reservation somewhere being a \u201cnoble savage\u201d and all today. Most probably I\u2019d be classified as a minority in my own country, have never learnt to speak the language of my ancestors, completely unaware of millennia of knowledge my people have amassed and deeply ashamed of my skin color that is the same hue as the earth of my land. I\u2019d probably not be a Buddhist either, since the cultural revival movement my grandparents were a part of would have never happened or would have been ruthlessly solved.

The paddy fields of the villages who joined the uprising were sown with salt, all males including children were killed.

On outside, this island probably would look better that it does today. Taller buildings, better infrastructure, higher GDP, better fed and whiter people\u2026.There would have been better horror movies too, since then they\u2019d have all those mass-burial grounds of natives to build insane asylums on.
