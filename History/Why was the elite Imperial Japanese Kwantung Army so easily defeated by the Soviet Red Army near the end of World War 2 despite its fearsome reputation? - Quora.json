            "answer_text": "Because: The Soviets were superior to the Kwantung army both qualitatively and quantitatively.Soviet forces achieved total surprise at all levels: strategic, operational and tactical.The Kwantung Army was no longer the elite formation it used to be. The quantitative and qualitative superiority of Soviet forces One essential and decisive component of warfare is balance of force defined by the number of soldiers, tanks, aircraft, artillery guns committed by combatant nations. Although quality has a decisive influence on the outcome of battles and wars, quantity matters as well because it affects not only a combatant nation\u2019s ability to replace battle losses and continue to fight but also the chance of achieving success in the offensive (in offensive warfare, it is the norm that the attacking force has to outnumber the defending force to stand a chance of success). So let\u2019s look at the balance of force:  Japanese order of battle  Soviet order of battle So the balance of force favored the Soviets. While there wasn\u2019t much disparity in manpower (1,577,725 for the Soviets and 1,217,000 for the Japanese), the Soviets exceeded the Japanese in other vital categories of modern equipments: tanks, artillery and aircraft. In modern warfare, technologies and materials played a pivotal role in deciding outcome of battles, more so than manpower. Not only that, the quality of Soviet hardware were superior to that of the Japanese with the exception of aircraft. The Soviet army had at their disposal the battle-tested T-34\u201385 medium tanks, ISU-152 tank destroyer for offensive operations plus thousands of trucks for logistical support.   In 1945, the T-34\u201385 was one of the best and reliable medium tanks in the world, having had all of the initial teething problems fixed. The IS-152 with its massive gun was capable of smashing any fortified position the Japanese had in Manchuria. By contrast, the counterparts of these formidable Soviet AFVs fielded by the Japanese were little more than junk (by European standards) that were inadequately armed and armored and vastly outclassed by Soviet tanks.  Type 95 Ha-Go light tank  Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank Japanese inferiority in armor was compounded by the lack of decent AT guns. The only Japanese weapons capable of stopping Soviet armors were what Soviet soldiers called \u201cdeath squads\u201d - Japanese soldiers strapped with explosives who hurled themselves unhesitatingly under Soviet tanks. It was typical of the Japanese in the final desperate years of WW2 to use suicide tactics. As one Japanese general stated: \u201clack of weapons is no excuse for defeat\u201d. The Japanese compensated for their deficiencies in technologies and materials by good old-fashioned sheer fanaticism and stupid bravery made possible by a military culture that utterly disregarded human lives. The only categories in which the Japanese compared favorably to the Soviets were aircraft. The Japanese had several first-rate fighters such as the Nakajima Ki-84, Kawanishi N1K that were probably better than Soviet fighters. However, a weapon is only as good as the operator. After years of attritional battles that inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese army air force (IJAAF), and the massed kamikaze attacks during April-June 1945 against US forces around Okinawa, there weren\u2019t that many veteran Japanese pilots left to operate those awesome fighters to their fullest potentials. To add more salt to the injury, shortage of aviation fuel (thanks to American submarine force) deprived the IJAAF of the fuel needed to conduct sorties to combat the Soviet air force and support IJA units on the ground. Apart from superiority in number and quality of weapons, the Soviet army in 1945 was vastly superior to the Kwantung Army. It was an army hardened through 4 years of relentless battles (1941\u20131945) with the best fighting force in the world: the German Wehrmacht. If in 1939, the Soviet army was a butt of joke, then in 1945, it was one of the most capable ground forces in the world, if not the best. Four years of battles with the Germans dramatically improved its leadership, operational and tactical capabilities. Soviet commanders at all levels - strategic, operation and tactical - were experienced and bold in conducting battles. The supreme commander of Soviet Far Eastern force - Field Marshal Aleksandr Vasilevsky - had been responsible for all decisive Soviet victories in Europe. His competence to formulate complex battle plans against the Japanese in Manchuria was indisputable. Soviet commanders at the army, divisional and regimental levels as well as the foot soldiers, tank crews and pilots all possessed considerable combat experience and competence to fight effectively. We will soon appreciate how the Soviets applied their vast reservoir of battle experience and military competence to execute an imaginative and daring offensive that took the Japanese by complete surprise.  Strategic, operational and tactical surprise Surprise at all levels contributed as much to ultimate Soviet victory as having better weapons and experienced leadership and soldiery. This decisive surprise was due to 2 things: Japanese erroneous estimation of the timetable of Soviet invasion AND their contempt of the Soviets.Soviet audacity and flexibility in executing the battle of maneuver.Japanese contempt of the Soviets stemmed from multiple sources: the Russo-Japanese War, foreign war report of wars with the Soviet Union and racial arrogance. Having defeat Russia in 1905, the Japanese were imbued with a mixture of arrogance and contempt for the Russian soldiers. This was the 1st time in history an Asiatic army defeated a white army. It certainly imbued the Japanese with a sense of superiority and contempt for Russian military ability. Despite being defeated by the Soviets in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol, Japanese contempt toward the Soviet enemies was unchanged. Instead, it intensified after reading reports of mediocre military performance of the Red Army in the war against Finland and Nazi Germany. That contempt caused the Japanese to underestimate the Soviet army. Even when an investigation into the state of strength of the Kwantung Army in 1945 concluded that it was understrength and subpar compared to the prewar state, the Japanese still regarded the Soviets as pushovers. They did not believe that an army that had been beaten repeatedly by their German ally was capable of mounting a successful large-scale offensive to defeat the million-man Kwantung army. That arrogance was strengthened by their faith in the difficulty of conducting large-scale offensive over a vast areas that abounded in mountains, hills, rivers compounded by torrential rains in the autumn that turned the ground into mud that hindered movements of vehicles. Thus, even after the Soviets announced that they would not renew the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact, the Japanese high command were confident that unfavorable weather conditions would preclude the Soviets from attacking until Spring 1946. Although there were some Japanese commanders who warned against that overconfidence and suspected strongly that the Soviet would attack as early as August 1945, their warnings fell on deaf ears. Meanwhile on the other side, Soviet commanders geared their forces for a battle of maneuver. Unlike the Japanese, the Soviets did not underestimate their opponents. Soviet commanders regarded the Kwantung Army as a worthy opponent and this motivated them to plan their offensive meticulously to increase the chance fo success. One particular Soviet military ability honed during the German-Soviet war was how to conduct combined-arms and maneuver warfare successfully. Practice and battles with the Werhmacht brought allowed Soviet commanders at all levels to improve their skills in bewegungskrieg. Emulating the Germans, Soviet junior commanders were encouraged to act on their initiative. In 1945, Soviet units were ready to execute a war of fluid movements that would take the Japanese by complete surprise. Soviet armored and infantry units bypassed strong points, encircled and cut off Japanese units which threw them into total disarray and facilitated piecemeal destruction of IJA\u2019s units. The performance of Soviet forces demonstrated impressive audacity and flexibility. They advanced under the cover of darkness or in unfavorable conditions or through difficult terrains the Japanese believed to be impassable. For examples, 1/ The pioneer units of 1st Far Eastern Front advanced in adverse weather and in darkness. They were aided by easy-to-disable primitive Japanese minefields. 2/ Soviet tanks and infantry brigades crossed small and large rivers. 3/ The 6th Guard Tank Army successfully traversed the Grand Khingan Mountains under the cover of darkness and heavy rain. 4/ The 5th and 113th Rifle Corps of the 39th Army advanced in adverse weather conditions.  Soviet Katyusha rockets bombarding Japanese positions  Tanks of the 46th Guards Tank Brigade crossing a river  Tanks of the 6th Guards Tank Army crossing the Grand Khingan mountains The flexibility of Soviet forces was reflected through smart allocation of resources and adaption of units to suit the terrains and strength of Japanese defense. Armies that operated in a front that was narrow or without much room for maneuver and that was strongly defended received generous heavy artillery support to overwhelm the defenders. Armies that operated over a broader area with plenty of room for maneuvering received more heavy vehicles to allowed for high-speed maneuver on the fields to bypass and encircle the Japanese. Armies that moved over difficult terrains received many engineer and sapper battalions to facilitate movements. It could also be a mix of all types of supports depending on the nature of the theater of operations. Soviet units were varied to suit the terrains and nature of enemy defense. Commanders used the rule of thumb that the stronger enemy defense was, the deeper the echelon disposition had to be. This would impart great momentum to the offensive and ensure deep penetration of the enemy defense.  This flexible organizations not only made efficient use of resources but also worsened the confusion of the Japanese who expected the Soviets to attack in formations whose compositions were well-known. It caused them to allocate resources improperly and make it more difficult for them to defeat Soviet attacks. Also, the use of Soviet forward detachments to probe deep and infiltrate Japanese positions was another big surprise for the Japanese. These mobile and fast-moving pioneering units were ably led by commanders allowed to act on their initiatives were very effective in preventing the Japanese from mounting a coherent defense. So all in all, a combination of: Japanese overconfidence, complacency that lulled them into a false sense of security about the timetable of Soviet invasionThe Soviets\u2019 skillful execution of maneuver warfare under unfavorable weathers and difficult terrains.Use of mobile probing unitstook the Japanese by total surprise. Indeed, in post-war interrogation, several Japanese officers expressed their amazement at the boldness of the Soviets to advance in adverse conditions, their ability to cross difficult terrains and the speed with which they advanced. In fact, the Soviets advanced so quickly and the surprise was so total that it wasn\u2019t until 24 hours later did the Japanese high commander appreciate the extent of penetration and magnitude of the Soviet offensives. By then, it was too late to turn the tide of the battle in Japan\u2019s favor.   The Kwantung Army was no longer the elite formation it used to be Originally created to defend Japan\u2019s Manchukuo puppet state, the Kwantung Army before the war (1941) had a fearsome reputation due to its composition of a million strong servicemen who were exceptionally fanatical, brave and well-trained. Although it was sorely lacking in heavy artillery and armors (by European standards), it still possessed great offensive and defensive capabilities. However in 1945, it had been reduced to a shadow of its formidable self due to several reasons. The war in the PacificOperation Ketsu-GoShortly after the Pacific War broke out with the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese succeeded in capturing vast landmasses once colonized by European powers as well as Islands in the Pacific. Anticipating that the Allies (primarily the Americans) would return to recapture these islands, the IJA sent troops to turn those islands into strong fortifications to resist invasion. In 1942, US forces engaged with IJA units on Guadalcanal in attritional battle that lasted 6 months. Both sides suffered heavy losses. Without reserve combat units from the home islands and wishing to renew their offensive, the IJA transferred units from China and other less active theaters to the Southwest Pacific to combat the Americans. The 20th and 41st Divisions were redeployed from Northern China and Korea to Guadalcanal where they would be decimated by a combination of disease, starvation and fanatical bravery and stupidity against US marines. In March 1943, the convoy carrying the entire 51st division from China to New Guinea was annihilated by US aircraft. Most men died in their transports. Shortly afterward, the 32nd and 35th divisions transported from China suffered the same fate by US submarines which sank most of the transport ships. The 52th Division was redeployed to Truk - Japan\u2019s premier forward naval base in the South Pacific. Unfortunately, the US island hopping strategy - made possible by the growing naval and air superiority of the US navy and air force - obviated the need to invade Truk. The islands garrisoned by more than 100,000 men strong were bypassed, starved of supply and forced to languish for the remainder of the war - an ignominious fate for the Japanese. 1944 marked the start of a gradual process of transfer of divisions from the Kwantung Army to reinforce islands in the Pacific. At that point, the Kwantung Army had 19 full-trained divisions. In February 1944, 2 infantry divisions (29th and 14th) were the first Kwantung units sent to Guam and Palau respectively where they would be destroyed in subsequent battles. In October 1944, 4 infantry divisions (1st, 8th, 10th and 24th) plus 2 armored divisions (2nd and 23rd) were sent to the Philippines in response to the US invasion at Leyte Gulf. 3 infantry divisions (9th, 12th and 71st) were sent to Formosa to counter the anticipated US invasion that never took place. The 109th division was sent to Iwo Jima where it would be annihilated in 1945. So by 1945, the Kwantung Army had lost 2 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 12 fully-trained divisions. In addition, there was great reduction in the number of air units redeployed for South Pacific operations and Kamikaze missions. IJA leaderships attempted to rectify this deficiency by raising new divisions. However, shortage of weapons, ammunitions, veteran instructors and physically fit recruits (due to shortage of foods) meant that the newly raised replacement were not comparable to the veteran divisions that had been destroyed. A meticulous inquiry into the state of strength of the Kwantung Army made the following telling conclusion: its strength had been weakened far beyond estimation and that although new divisions had only a fractions of fighting effectiveness of the lost divisions. Finally, preparation for Ketsu-Go - Decisive Battle on the Home Islands - also weakened the Kwantung army. Ketsu-Go was the grand strategic plan intended to inflict extremely heavy losses on the US invasion forces predicted to invade Kyushu in November 1945. The Japanese knew that by killing/maiming enough Americans they would compel the US government to negotiate for a cease fire that would allow Japan\u2019s leaders to exit the war with national honor and some gains of the imperialist conquest preserved (They feared that the US would not invade and instead strangle Japan by naval blockade.) The Japanese staked absolutely everything for Ketsu-Go: thousands of aircraft for kamikaze attacks, millions of men, ammunition and weapons. They raised new divisions on the islands and transferred several remaining combat-capable units from the Kwantung Army to the Home Islands. The Kwantung Army was therefore weakened even further. As a side note, this fact was proof that the Imperial General HQ had chosen to write off Manchuria (at least temporarily) because had they still wanted to protect Manchuria Kwantung against anticipated Soviet invasion, they would have maintained the Kwantung Army at a respectable level of strength.  Summary The superb strategic, operational and tactical capabilities of the Soviet army in 1945 that resulted from 4 years of battles with the WehrmachtComplete surprise at all level due to Japanese complacency and Soviet imaginative operational performance that defied Japanese expectationThe qualitative deterioration of the KwantungAll of these made Soviet Victory in Manchuria a foregone conclusion.

            "answer_text": "The Kwantung army was outnumbered and outgunned by a very wide margin. The Kwantung army essentially was the same army that the Red Army had already beaten in 1939 at Khalkhin Gol. That was the Red Army of 1939, which was in turn absolutely smashed by Wehrmacht, rebuilt itself, reorganised, gathered experience and then beat the Wehrmacht back to Berlin. The Red Army \u201cmodel 1945\u201d was the most powerful ground force of the world. It was an army of hardened veterans with 2\u20133 years of experience, experienced command staff, immensely saturated with artillery and armored vehicles, good airforce, robust command and control system and overwhelming numbers to boot. By August 1945 the forces of the opposing sides were: USSR: 1.75 million men Vs. Japan: 927 thousand men. USSR: 26 137 artillery pieces Vs Japan: 6 700 artillery pieces USSR: 5 556 tanks and SP Guns Vs Japan: 1 000 tanks USSR: 5 386 airplanes Vs Japan: 1 800 airplanes. Almost double the manpower, four times the guns, over five times the tanks, three times the airpower. And essentially the Red Army was qualitatively superior in every aspect. The Soviet tanks were way better than Japanese, the Soviet airplanes were way better than Japanese, the Soviet guns were heavier, infantry, tankers and pilots were all more experienced. As the soviet \u201cHistory of the Great patriotic War\u201d correctly states: \u201cThe units of the Kwantung army had absolutely no submachine guns, anti-tank rifles, rocket artillery, very little SHQR and high-caliber artillery (infantry divisions and brigades mostly had 75mm guns in artillery regiments detachments). *SHQR - Supreme Headquarters Reserve - is what the USSR called their own heavy and superheavy artillery that was subordinate directly to supreme command, not being attached to any particular unit. Of course the Japanese did not call their own strategic artillery that, but the book author chose to use a term his reader would easily understand. The combat diary of the Soviet Transbaikal front for 1945 states: \u201cThe Japanese tanks are outdated and weak, they cannot compete even with our light tanks\u201d I don\u2019t know about the light tanks, but by that time the Red Army was definitely not using its light tanks as the main fighting vehicles. What the Japanese could field was a Chi-Ha Type 97:  With a 57mm short-barreled cannon and 27mm armor. The Japanese field AT guns were 37 and 47 mm. That means that the Japanese simply did not have a gun piece that could effectively combat the main tank of the Red Army - the T-34/85, let alone heavier vehicles that the Red Army had been using as breakthrough tanks - mostly the IS-2 with a 122mm gun and 120 mm of front armor.  The overwhelming technical and numerical superiority plus superior combat experience was what had allowed the Red Army to smash the Quantung army to pieces, even despite fierce and valorous resistance of the Japanese.
