            "answer_text": "Well\u2026. It all started like a crook (with ulterior motives) dating a shy girl (new to the outside world)\u2026 So basically, it wasn\u2019t much of an \u201cAllow\u201d or \u201cReject\u201d sort of scenario\u2026. East India Company came to India with a very few men, posing as traders from far west\u2026. It was that time in history when geographic exploration was not at all booming like today\u2026. countries had limited opportunities to communicate with other parts of the world\u2026. Hence, it was taken as more of an opportunity by Indian rulers that time to get in trade with them (which was really a good decision at their part, if the other party would have stuck only with trade) When the Brits came to India, they were already ahead in terms of Industrial revolution and cultural modernisation in comparison to a country where \u201cSati practice\u201d was still in place and common man had almost no fundamental rights of their own. With a country filled with downtrodden people like us with the power in the hands of a select few, those who could be numbered on fingers, it wasn\u2019t a herculean task to figure out by the Brits that this provides them with an opportunity to play there modern tactics and harness the resources this land offers. So now you could understand why I compared it with a crook dating a shy girl. The crook has also the charms up his sleeves to woo a shy girl in his aura and then gradually he forces himself up her with his crookedness and make the shy girl a victim to his vicious deeds. Note: The above story is just to illustrate what actually happened in the simplest way possible. It doesn\u2019t mean all Britishers are crooks or Indians are like a shy girl or there is any hatred prevailing. Those were different times. ",
