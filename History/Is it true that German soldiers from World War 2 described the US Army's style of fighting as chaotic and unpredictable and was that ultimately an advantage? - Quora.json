            "answer_text": "Well, a couple of things are true here that I believe are relevant. One, the Allies won the war when the US entered the war, for reasons of economic production and population. However, it\u2019s not possible for an individual soldier to see that, only an economic maven. So, a lot of German soldiers watched how the US conducted \u201csoldiering\u201d (shoot at everything, use the air force on everything, fire five or ten times as much artillery as your opponents at unconfirmed \u201ctargets\u201d) and thought it was kind of silly. And you would too, unless you had a huge surplus population, huge surplus materiel, and huge surplus manufacturing capability - all of which isn\u2019t being bombed ever! If you know you have those things, though, the alternatives become silly - why risk lives when money will do? Two, US troops entered the European Theater in 1943. This means that the greenest German troops those US troops met had zero years of combat experience, and the most experienced had four: 1939\u20131943. Each and every American had zero years of combat experience meaningful to the ETO in 1943. It took a while to \u2018catch up\u2019, if catch up the US ever did, in experience. Early US failures were legendarily embarrassing: infantry trying to take cover behind operational friendly tanks and shit, not realizing it made them hugely identifiable targets. Standing next to each other in combat, for moral support. That kind of thing. But the US got better. By late \u201944 or early \u201845, they fielded the same capable, professional military anyone else still in a long conflict that they\u2019re winning does. I don\u2019t buy \u2018chaotic and unpredictable throughout the war\u2019 any more than I buy the usual \u2018Red Army were undertrained conscripts throughout the war\u2019. Battle can serve as training. You\u2019d better believe some of those Guards Rifles would shoot your face off before you ever saw them by \u201845. The confluence of these factors, inexperience and almost limitless material wealth, I claim led to some interesting and improvised tactics that may have led to the claim you mention about chaos and unpredictability, but overall the tactics of the day were more absolute than this: the Americans paid a price for their arrogance up front, but learned fast, and their own advantages were not things the German Army could simply learn.

            "answer_text": "My father was a combat engineer in World War II. He told me that for a while they were using a farm house for cover. If somebody from the unit was seen by the Germans, the Germans would lob a few mortar rounds, but would stop immediately if they lost sight of the Americans. This was due to the fact that the German manuals said not to fire unless they could actually see the enemy. Germany was always low on supplies and had to be economical in their use. Similar to the Japanese Navy, the German Army believed in meticulously planned strikes that would gain ground before the enemy could recover. This worked well in the Blitzrieg attack though France and Belgium, but failed miserably in the Battle of the Bulge. They were also very well trained in fighting retreats, which required a great deal of training and planning to avoid leaving points exposed. The Americans used their incredible logistical ability to move huge amounts of material to the front lines. They also believed in using their material far more generously, using large amounts of artillery even if they weren\u2019t sure of the enemy positions. This was the origin of reconnaissance by fire. Reconnaissance by fire - Wikipedia They also worked according to a policy that gave low-ranking officers the ability to order massive artillery and aerial attacks. To the Germans, it appeared that the Americans were wasting material without much planning or results. To the Americans, the results were worth the material. The British and American forces also believed in maintaining a steady advance of the front line instead of using attacks at strategic points to break through the line. They felt that units engaged in such a breakthrough would be quickly surrounded and destroyed by the enemy. That is what happened to the Germans at the battle of the Bulge. The Allied lines barely moved and the German forces were obliterated. That is also why the Allies didn\u2019t bypass the Hurtgen Forest. If they had bypassed it, the Germans would have surrounded the Allied forces and destroyed them. (That\u2019s where the German equipment for the Battle of the Bulge was collecting.) The Germans were trained for launching raids and countering the enemy\u2019s raids. One possible comparison would have been to compare the German attacks to the tactics of Robert E. Lee in the American Civil War and the Allied tactics to those of Grant and Sherman. In fact, the Battle of Gettysburg had many similarities to the Battle of the Bulge. The American advances seemed sloppy and uncoordinated to the Germans, but the Americans felt that trying to coordinate everything completely would have delayed the advance and given the Germans an opportunity to counter-attack. Instead of planning the movement of the front-line troops, the Allies spent their time planning and improving the logistical supply of the troops, planning the movement of the troops around the movement of the supplies. The Allied plans seemed unpredictable to the Germans because they weren\u2019t using the same strategies. ",
