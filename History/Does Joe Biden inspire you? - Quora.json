            "answer_text": "Biden was my Senator in the tiny state of Delaware for many years. He has no desire to inspire you. He is a policy wonk who likes people and wants to get the details right and get the right people in the right places. I\u2019d bet what he wishes if he was president right now: not to give inspiring speeches while COVID-19 floods our hospitals, but rather to have appointed the best professionals to the CDC years ago, to have set up good relations between epidemiologists in the US and China so we had all the details early, to have helped both China and Italy when it hit them first and learned from their experiences, and to have been totally prepared with testing and case tracking here. America would look like Taiwan: more testing, more case tracking. We might need to shut down for 3 weeks, not 8; see 10,000 people die before the vaccine, not 100,000 or 250,000. America would be listed with Taiwan and Germany as a success story, not listed with Iran and Italy. If Biden was president, Trump would be tweeting that a few thousand older people dying is just like the flu and not worth shutting down the economy for 3 whole weeks and Biden is a loser. That\u2019s what he wants to do. Not inspire you. Around the world, presidents that inspire are often trouble. Personally, I wish the Democratic primary voters had picked someone more ready to tackle the generations-long problems in DC, and someone younger. But Biden would make a better-than-average president. He\u2019ll appoint good people, he\u2019ll let the anti-corruption candidates that I really like have some access. He\u2019ll talk to Republicans and might even mean that a few more senators decide to follow in McCain and Romney\u2019s footsteps, which matters. I\u2019ll watch West Wing for inspiration (or listen to FDR\u2019s inaugural again.) ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve read quite a few answers about why biden isn\u2019t inspirational. So, I want to write about why JOE BIDEN inspires me. I\u2019m inspired by: (a) his EXTRAORDINARY RESILIENCE AND COURAGE (b) his Belief in Democracy and America (c) his economic vision for America. Using technology to improve lives so we should be promoting Green jobs, Infrastructure repairs, promoting greater equality (which should include Net Neutrality and internet access for all, just like we believe electricity and water are utilities to be made available for all). (1) I\u2019m inpired by his EXTRAORDINARY RESILIENCE AND COURAGE. Consider, he lost his first wife and daughter in a car accident when he was a young man. His 2 sons were injured. Fortunately, they recovered. But then, as a 72 year old man, he lost his eldest son to Gliobastoma an aggressive type of brain cancer. This is what an expert had to say about Gliobastoma: \u201cThere are no known causes for brain cancer, said Dr. Charles Redfern, medical director of Sharp Healthcare\u2019s new Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute and Center for Neuro-Oncology. However, he said, the biggest risk factor is age. He said what makes the disease particularly devastating is that it strips sufferers of body function. That often includes the ability to think, see, speak, move, feel and comprehend. \u201cBrain tumors are often devastating,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can think of it as like having a stroke. \u2026 You could go from being a 40-year-old state\u2019s attorney to being in a wheelchair overnight \u2026 or you could go from taking care of kids to needing someone to take care of you.\u201d\u201d Cancer that took life of Beau Biden, uncommon, but dangerous I cannot imagine, losing one child, let alone 2 and a partner I love. I cannot imagine the pain of losing MY child to cancer and then, on top of that, watching My Child deteriorate over a period of months. Perhaps My Child loses his sense of sight, or touch, or hearing. And then more and more of my child will disappear as the Gliobastoma engulfs his brain. Until he is but a shell of the human being who was MY CHILD . The closest I can imagine what Joe Biden went through is watching a parent you love grow senile or getting fast deteriorating alzheimers, then multiply that pain by a million times. In the 21st Century, with all the advances in medicine, it is an extremely unlucky parent who has to endure the death of a beloved child. But Joe Biden did not grow bitter. I believe these profound tragedies has made him HUMBLE. Quite frankly, if I have to live through what he did, and I didn\u2019t have young children dependent on my survival, I\u2019d simply have lost the will to live. (2) I\u2019m inspired by his Belief in Democracy and America. When Joe Biden decided NOT to run for POTUS in 2016, he KNEW that the chances of him every running for POTUS was likely to be zero. After all, HRC was widely expected to win in 2016 and no matter how rotten a president she was, she would likely be the incumbent nominee in 2020. So it seems to me, that Joe Biden gave up his ambition and accepted what he saw was his fate. I believe that Joe Biden came back into politics and offered himself as a choice to be the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominees in large part because he believed that democracy and America were in grave risk. He gave the democrats and the people a 3rd choice. If we didn\u2019t want Sanders or Warren there was Joe Biden. He was the old and steady pair of hands. And if that\u2019s what people wanted, then he was here to help. If they voted against him, then that was that. Remember. He had ALREADY WALKED AWAY from that ambition for the rest of his life. He didn\u2019t have to come back to all the scrutiny, to all the criticisms, to all the slander and libel. And all for the risk of losing the primary anyway. In this equation there was nothing for Joe and Jill Biden to gain other than because they believed the soul of America was truly at risk and they felt they had to try to do something. Still, it was NOT their choice but the people\u2019s. Some folks say that Joe Biden is now the nominee because of the DNC and Mass media supporting him. Really, we are so easily influenced? How do you explain the votes which Bernie Sanders got, including winning Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, but not other primaries? Those voters are smart but everyone else is stupid? BTW full disclosure: My Choice during the primaries was ANDREW YANG even though I knew he was a long shot. I will however VOTE for Biden because I do believe the soul of America and democracy is at risk. (3) Joe Biden\u2019s economic vision for America THE BIDEN PLAN TO INVEST IN MIDDLE CLASS COMPETITIVENESS \u2013 Joe Biden for President I agree that we should be promoting Green Technology. Solar, Wind energy. Fracking? Let fracking compete with Solar and Wind and Hydrogen. Our infrastructure needs work. Greater equality includes ensuring that there is net neutrality and fast, reliable broadband access to the internet for everyone. I believe we need to narrow the digital divide. Healthcare - improve on Obamacare. Private health options MUST be available. But public ones are also available We do it in Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan, etc. Education. Dump\u2019s fans like to say that Dump is better for the economy. I see no evidence of that. The trillion dollar tax cut benefited big corporations and the 1%. The debts of this trillion dollar tax cut is NOT PAYING for itself. Where is the 3% annualised growth rate which you need? Where is there a coherent plan to ensure good paying jobs? Sure, unemployment fell during dump\u2019s tenure. But it was not sustainable. Joe Biden\u2019s economic vision for America is achievable. I believe he will achieve it. It\u2019s not perfect and I hope he will consider UBI as one of the tools in his arsenal. Because I believe that AI, Robotics, 5G Broadband and IOT are going to change the way we all work. Many will lose their jobs and not get an equivalent job. But Joe\u2019s measures are a start in the right direction. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Well, maybe. I was inspired by Obama. Have you listened to his speeches?  That was incredibly inspiring. I don\u2019t see Joe doing that. At least not at the same rate of eloquence. Obama was an inspirational President. Biden is a good man, and will definitely be a better President anytime than the currently nincompoop in the White House: the brainless madman, the Donald. I\u2019m European. A few months ago, I became American citizen. I used to be a little conservative, but I always thought healthcare and education should be a human right, don\u2019t blame me, it works wonderfully in Europe and Japan, therefore my first choice was Bernie Sanders. He endorsed Biden today, so I will. Do you remember how Trump keeps calling the press, and anyone who opposes him as the \u201cEnemy of the people\u201d? I actually think he is the enemy of the American people. His authoritarian views should concern everyone in the United States. It is actually disturbing seeing conservatives, Republicans, and even libertarians supporting such behaviors. It is a sad time for Americans, and it left the bar extremely low for the White House. In conclusion, Biden can be inspirational when compared to the current uneducated President. Biden shares the values most of the American people do. Biden will bring back the United States to lead the World. Biden will take back the United States to its historical allies. Biden knows science is the cure for the current situation. Biden is a decent man. Sanders endorsement isn\u2019t enough. Wait until you see Obama join the fight to recover the United States from the cult. It will help him more, and wait until he choices a great VP as well. Biden has inspirational people around him: that alone, makes him inspirational.  ",

Like most of the country I will vote for him because Trump is not a choice. With any luck he will pick a running mate who is vibrant and will help make changes to our political system. This person should, for the good of future generations, accept a loss in Presidential power to prevent a tyrant from exercising unlimited power. There will always be people who will want to have unrestricted power. Hopefully we can move towards a bipartisan agreement to really limit it in an emergency, obviously the last four years proved the current system doesn\u2019t work. ",
