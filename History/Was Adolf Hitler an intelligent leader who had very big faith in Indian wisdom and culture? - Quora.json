List of speeches given by Adolf Hitler - Wikipedia You can check all of them if you like. You will find that Hitler hardly ever referred to India or Hindus. On the rare occasions that Hitler referred to India or Hindus, he was NOT appreciating India or Hindus. Hitler was a racist, a Nordicist, a white European Christian, born in Christian Europe, studied at Christian schools, wished to become a Christian monk when he was a child, and despised POC Hindu Indians. Hitler was not a wise man. Clear? I trust you know that in Nazi terminology Aryan = Nordic. When Nazis said \u201cAryan\", they meant \u201cNordic\u201d. Nazis were Nordic supremacists, and claimed their racial origins to be in Norway. Clear? If your school, Hollywood, news media, or someone else gave you the impression that Hitler became a demon because of Indian influence, cancel them from your life. They are liars. ",
