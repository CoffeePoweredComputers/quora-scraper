            "answer_text": "There were multiple variables that made the war unwinnable. We saw the French fight an unwinnable war with the Viet Minh post-WW-II until 1954 yet learned very little from it. Our intentions were somewhat noble\u2014to stop the rapid surge of Communism which had spread throughout Europe post-WW-II and Asia. An excellent (but long book) on the origins of the war is the Pulitzer winning book Embers of War: The Fall of an Empire and the Making of America's Vietnam. It is the most thorough historical account as to how America got mired into the Indochina (Vietnam) mess. Here is my assessment of the unwinnable elements: China\u2019s backdoor policy. China had learned from Russia to surround yourself with \u2018positively-disposed neighbors\u2019 (that is why it invaded Tibet soon after the Communist came to power). You want to maintain a buffer against possible invasion. When it looked as though the North Koreans were on the verge of losing and a pro-Western government could become its Southern neighbor, it invaded to protect North Korea as a \u2018positively-disposed neighbor.\u2019 It achieved that object by preventing North Korea from falling to the UN. China invested billions and up to 300,000 troops in North Vietnam to achieve the same protectionism of its neighbor. China was quite willing to go to war again to protect that border and the US knew it. China had nuclear capabilities and so did the Soviets, who had implied a willingness to defend North Vietnam, if needed.Nationalism First\u2014Communism Second. Ho Chi Minh\u2019s original objectives were a united Vietnam without foreign influences or occupation. He had the cult of personality\u2014we had nothing close to that. Although he had an opportunity to win US support for nationalist efforts (the US despised the French colonialist), he could not disclaim his Communist intentions. Because he was able to use the Chinese (historically), the French, the Japanese, then the US backing of the French, and then the US as illustrative of a Vietnam under the influences of foreign governments, it was not a hard case to win support of his countrymen for nationalist efforts, even though they were Communist-backed. \u201cHelp free Vietnam from the shackles of Imperial domination. Vietnam for Vietnamese\u201d was the rallying cry. It made perfect sense. Even though the French and eventually the US poured billions of aid and developed much of Vietnam, they were perceived as masters rather than allies. Here is a quote from HO, \u201cIt is better to sacrifice everything than to live in slavery!\u201d Here is another quote, \u201cWe have been fighting for our independence for more than 25 years and of course we cherish peace, but we will never surrender our independence to purchase a peace with the United States or any party.\u201dA strong non-opposed government against a shaky corrupt one. After the French withdrew from Tonkin and portions of Annam in 1954 and 1955, Ho and his colleagues established a totalitarian state north of the 17th Parallel. His government repressed all forms of dissent. In 1956, the Lao Dong Party violently repressed a rebellion of disgruntled farmers in Ho\u2019s home province of Nghe An. At the same time, the Party executed thousands of people in an attempt to rid North Vietnam of Western influences. The Communist had no problem using violence to suppress opposition to include assassinating thousands of South Vietnamese\u2019s appointed government village and provincial chiefs. The original government of the South was a weak one run by the French puppet emperor, Bao Dai. This was replaced by Diem, who was hated by many for his anti-Buddist policies and actions. After Diem\u2019s assassination, it was a series of military coups and governments that appeared weak. A position of strength compared to one of weakness was a challenge.The draft. The draft placed a lot of folks at risk who had no intention on serving in the military, especially in a time when risk of loss of life or limb was so great. Although the US is a patriotic country, we are not one of national service with only 7% of the eligible folks ever serving in the military. In fact, during the largest war the US has ever experienced, the Civil War, there was a large and violent draft demonstration in New York in 1863 resulting in 120 deaths and 2000 injuries. Despite overall patriotic support for our efforts in WW-II, 20% of Americans who served had to be drafted. Most had no intention in serving, especially with the possibility of death or damage. The draft resistance helped to fuel the already simmering college war resistance on many campuses. This visible opposition to the war made people second guess the value of the war. It was seen on TV every night.American mindset toward loss of life. The US placed a much higher value on its youth (soldiers, marines, airmen, sailors) than the Vietnamese. For example, I noticed many \u2018buddy retrievals\u2019 when in a firefight an American soldier would risk his life to retrieve a wounded buddy or recover his body under fire. I never saw the same actions from the enemy\u2014ever. Our Medal of Honor winners won mostly for sacrifice for their fellow fighters. There was no reciprocal action or award for the NVA or Viet Cong. They were willing to sacrifice millions (as they did) to achieve their objective while we saw the protection of a small Asian country against Communist rule as not a major threat to our own safety as non-threatening and unjustifiable. Here is his quote on the number of deaths they were prepared to sacrifice, \u201cYou can kill ten of our men for every one we kill of yours. But even at those odds, you will lose and we will win.\u201d If you value the lives of your military far greater than your enemy, you will be at a greater disadvantage.Wrong strategy. Westmoreland was fighting a guerilla war with WW-II strategies. His War of Attrition was a lost method from the beginning and unfortunately by the time the US president realized he was the wrong man leading the charge and replaced him with a more capable general, Abrams, he had blown five years of US and media support for the war. By the time Abrams came on board, post-Tet, the media was turning against the war and it was poisoning the US population\u2019s opinion as to whether the war could be won. In actuality, the US had won every battle except two and had majorly defeated the VC during Tet in 1968 but the media was beginning to portray it as a lost cause\u2014unwinnable. The media were allowed free rein to go where and when and this went little control of the message.DC Strategy. Unfortunately, most of the field strategies and tactics (bombings, unit movements, etc) were made from Washington DC, either by politicians or generals totally removed from the field. Field commanders were allowed little authority, especially with major consequential moves.No event in American history is more misunderstood than the Vietnam War. It was misreported then, and it is misremembered now. Richard M. Nixon ",

            "answer_text": "Define \u201cwin\u2026.\u201d It is an article of faith in the revisionist anti-American postwar history of Vietnam that the United States had no exit strategy. That is false. The American\u2019s DID have an exit strategy. They defined victory (to \u201cwin\u201d) based on the Korean model. To force North Vietnam to sign a ceasefire in place, and count on a long term armistice that allowed North Vietnam and South Vietnam to develop under their respective governments. Under the free-market model South Vietnam adapted it would have developed into a prosperous nation with relatively free citizens. Under the command-economy North Vietnam adapted it would have failed economically, and its citizens would have groveled in poverty under a totalitarian dictatorship, the same as West Germany/East Germany or North Korea/South Korea. In 1972 North Vietnam launched a major over the boarder invasion of South Vietnam. The ARVN fought the NVA to a standstill, then counterattacked, threatening to wipe out the NVA which was trapped in place by American airpower. North Vietnam was forced to sign a ceasefire in place, meeting the American end-game criteria. At that point the United States had \u201cwon\u201d the Vietnam War by their prewar standard of winning.
