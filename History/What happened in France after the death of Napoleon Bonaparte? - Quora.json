            "answer_text": "After the 1814 campaign in North-East France, Napoleon signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau was exiled to the island of Elba. Louis XVIII became the the new Emperor of France till Napoleon escaped from Elba on 26 February 1815, via the French brig \u2018Inconstant\u2019 with some 1,000 men and landed at Golfe-Juan, between Cannes and Antibes, on 1 March 1815, thus marking the start of les Cent Jours (the hundred days). Napoleon was finally defeated by the seventh coalition at the Battle of Waterloo, on 18 June 1815. On 22 June 1815 he abdicated in favour of his son, Napoleon Francis Joseph Charles Bonaparte, well knowing that it was a formality, as his four-year-old son was in Austria. With the abdication of Napoleon, a provisional government with Joseph Fouch\u00e9 as acting president was formed. On 25 June 1815, Napoleon received from Fouch\u00e9, the president of the newly appointed provisional government (and Napoleon's former police chief), an intimation that he must leave Paris. He retired to Malmaison, the former home of Jos\u00e9phine, where she had died shortly after his first abdication. On 29 June 1815, the near approach of the Prussians, who had orders to seize Napoleon, dead or alive, caused him to retire westwards toward Rochefort, whence he hoped to reach the United States. The presence of blockading Royal Navy warships under Vice Admiral Henry Hotham, with orders to prevent his escape, forestalled this plan.On 7 July 1815, the two Coalition armies, with Graf von Zieten's Prussian I Corps as the vanguard, entered Paris. On 8 July 1815, the French King, Louis XVIII, made his public entry into Paris, amidst the acclamations of the people, and again occupied the throne. Unable to remain in France or escape from it, Napoleon surrendered to Captain Frederick Maitland of HMS Bellerophon in the early morning of 15 July 1815 and was transported to England. Napoleon was exiled to the island of Saint Helena where he died in May 1821. Louis XVIII ruled as king for slightly less than a decade. The government of the Bourbon Restoration was a constitutional monarchy, unlike the Ancien R\u00e9gime, which was absolutist. As a constitutional monarch, Louis XVIII's royal prerogative was reduced substantially by the Charter of 1814, France's new constitution. Louis had no children; so upon his death the crown passed to his brother, Charles, Count of Artois (Charles X). Charles X ruled France from 16 September 1824 until 2 August 1830. For most of his life he was known as the Count of Artois (in French, comte d'Artois). An uncle of the uncrowned Louis XVII and younger brother to reigning kings Louis XVI and Louis XVIII, he supported the latter in exile and eventually succeeded him. His rule of almost six years ended in the July Revolution of 1830, which resulted in his abdication and the election of Louis Philippe I as King of the French. Exiled once again, Charles died in 1836 in Gorizia, then part of the Austrian Empire. He was the last of the French rulers from the senior branch of the House of Bourbon. Louis Philippe I ruled France from 1830 to 1848 as the leader of the Orl\u00e9anist party. As a member of the cadet branch of the Royal House of France and a cousin of King Louis XVI of France by reason of his descent from their common ancestors Louis XIII and Louis XIV, he had earlier found it necessary to flee France during the period of the French Revolution in order to avoid imprisonment and execution, a fate that actually befell his father Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans. He spent 21 years in exile after he left France in 1793. He was proclaimed king in 1830 after his cousin Charles X was forced to abdicate in the wake of the events of the July Revolution of that year. His government, known as the July Monarchy, was dominated by members of a wealthy French elite and numerous former Napoleonic officials. He followed conservative policies, especially under the influence of the French statesman Fran\u00e7ois Guizot during the period 1840\u201348. He also promoted friendship with Britain and sponsored colonial expansion, notably the conquest of Algeria. His popularity faded as economic conditions in France deteriorated in 1847, and he was forced to abdicate after the outbreak of the French Revolution of 1848. He lived out his life in exile in United Kingdom. After the French Revolution of 1848, the Second French Republic was created. ",

            "answer_text": "Throughout the 16th to 18th centuries; France was a rich Catholic monarchy known for its aristocratic excesses and debauched lifestyle throughout Europe.  In a recent book; \u201cThe Age of Anger\u201d; the author Pankaj Mishra talks about the impact Jean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s philosophy had on the working class and normal citizenry(non-nobility) that led to the French Revolution and drastic upheaval that led to great fear and uncertainty in France and the rest of Europe which largely consisted of monarchies at the time. This long historical brief was to understand the vacuum in which the short Frenchman Napoleon rose to prominence from a relatively insignificant position; conquered most of Europe and was the most famous military commander in the West till the rise of Hitler more than a century later. After Napoleon\u2019s exile to Elba; his escape and another war; the U.K incarcerated him in St. Helena; where he died in 1821. He had set in place many reforms in France; including in higher education; a tax code, road and sewer systems; as well as establishing the Banque de France; the first central bank in the country\u2019s history. Also; unlike most of the monarchies at the time and significantly Hitler; Napoleon encouraged Jews and other minorities to settle in his kingdom. Europe and France reverted to their old ways after Napoleon\u2019s defeat in Waterloo and exile to St. Helena in 1815. Louis XVIII who had lived in exile after the French Revolution and the execution of his brother the last king Louis XVI in 1792 and the death of his son Louis XVII in prison; reigned for a decade from 1815 to 1824; after which he was succeeded by Charles X. There was another revolution in the country; called the \u201cJuly Revolution\u201d which led to the reign of Louis Phillipe I. France was in turmoil once again after economic problems; and another revolution in 1848 led to the creation of the French Second Republic; and the rule of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte; who was a nephew of the original Napoleon. Too many Louis in the French monarchy soup. The guy was the last monarch for the French nation; as he was defeated and captured by the Prussians(Germany\u2019s largest state) under Otto Von Bismarck. France became a parliamentary republic which it has remained except for a short interlude when it was under Hitler\u2019s Nazi German forces. As Napoleon disrupted the comfortable but inept kingdoms of the time; and implemented many reforms; his influence and legacy remained strong in the European cultural context until he was upstaged by the Nazi kill machine and Hitler in WWII. Indirectly; Napoleon was also instrumental in German unification; when he dissolved the Holy Roman Empire; a major political force in the Continent and brought down the number of German kingdoms from 300 to around 50. Germans believed that they were looked down upon by the more established empires and were late to the global plunder party Europeans had unleashed on the world. France however which was historically the cultural centre of the West and the country most admired for its lavishness; art etc found itself under the boorish German boot two times in the 1870s and 1940s. So; to sum it up France\u2019s politics; geopolitical standing and strategy was majorly affected by the defeat; exile and subsequent death of the \u201cLittle Corporal\u201d Napoleon. ",
