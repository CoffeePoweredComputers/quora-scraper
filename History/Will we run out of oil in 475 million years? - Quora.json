            "answer_text": "End of oil - Full disclosure: This is the latest version of a canned answer built after answering this same question in slightly different wording several times. It is updated as needs be. First, last and always, the world will never run out of coal, oil or natural gas. This is not because of some unlimited supply the public is unaware of or some miraculous regeneration previously unknown to science. This is because the energy industry and the world's scientists are continually investigating new and/or improved sources of energy, improved techniques in finding and recovering hydrocarbons and improving the efficiency of all variety of devices that utilize these energy sources. The costs associated with hydrocarbons will fluctuate over time just as it has since the Colonel hit that first strike in PA. Meanwhile the costs of so called renewable sources will continue to drop as technology develops to improve those sources. Eventually, in different locations around the world, at different times, those expenses will flip and future production after that will be solely for non-energy needs that will support higher prices that fuel or electrical generation. One must realize that there are many uses of oil and gas beyond energy already (Medicines, Insecticides, Ink, Floor Wax, Pens, Upholstery, Clothing, Boats, Sports Car Bodies, Nail Polish, Fishing Lures, etc.). The need for flight fuel will most likely be the longest lasting petroleum energy need. The bottom line is what does it cost to generate and how many are willing/able to pay that expense. Innovation and invention are prime key words in the O&G industry. The first \u201cfracturing\u201d patent was issued in 1865 to a civil war vet experienced in explosives. In 1949, the first application of hydraulic fracturing was performed by The Halliburton co with a process developed and patented by Stanolind. In 1967 nuclear fracturing experimentation was performed in New Mexico with a 29 kiloton device. (Google \u201cproject gas buggy\u201d) Without stepping through all the improvements of fluids, proppants and pumps today, you may easily see 20 to 25 frac jobs in one horizontal wellbore. I won\u2019t even start on geophysics, drillbits, testing, etc., etc., etc. Added commentary: I keep hearing rumors that wind or solar or something else is \u201calready cheaper than petroleum\u201d. Well, of course they are - in sub-Saharan Africa, the Alaskan outback, the Andes, \u2026. You get the idea. Anywhere that doesn\u2019t already have petroleum infrastructure can easily take on wind and solar cheaper than building pipelines and refineries. But to say the same about in the US or in Europe is ridiculous. The only thing that brings that balance is the direct subsidies paid by all taxpayers whether they are customers or not. ",

            "answer_text": "We have ignored the warnings of our top climate experts and allowed Oil & Gas psychopaths to continue burning oil.  We are living in a HOT planet, with 410 ppm concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.  Exporting oil is not for energy, it is about wars, nuclear weapons and imperialism. There is a glut of oil we can\u2019t burn, it is worthless, and there is no place to store it.  Tyrone, I am sorry to say, unless you are 3 years old, you need to do all you can to stop the climate criminals. Why would you ask about 475 Million years? What do you think may happen then? Here is the story of 800,000 years  Good luck Tyrone ! ",
