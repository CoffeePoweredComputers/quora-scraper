            "answer_text": "There were no ninjas in existence in Japan during World War 2. The Ninja started to disappear after the Japanese modernised their armed forces. In 1938, Japanese military intelligence established the Nakano School for spies; its official name was \"Training Unit for Rear Duties Agents.\" While the Japanese government wanted foreign studies, the school\u2019s romantic young officers believed themselves to be modern-day ninjas. (\"Success in clandestine activity comes from integrity\" was the unit motto.) Accordingly, Nakano students studied martial arts and disguises as well as infiltration, propaganda, and sabotage, and some of the nonsense written about ninjutsu originated from this location. Why? In the words of historians Meirion and Susie Harries, \"Many Japanese spies also tended toward the credulous.\" In this the Japanese were hardly alone: Special Operations Executive and the Office of Strategic Services were Nakano\u2019s British and American equivalents. Until 1942, their instructor was Morihei Ueshiba; after that it was a series of Shotokan and Wado-ryu karate instructors. (Evidently Ueshiba's aikibudo students were having some trouble dodging bullets, so with shortened training schedules the Japanese Army figured a punch in the nose and a kick in the crotch would work better.) For some passing references, see Louis Allen, \"The Nakano School,\" Japan Society Proceedings, 10, 1985, 9-15; Harries and Harries, \"Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army\" (New York: Random House, 1991); Graham Noble, Noble, \"Master Funakoshi\u2019s Karate, Part III,\" _Dragon Times_, vol. 5, 1996, 6-7; (I didn't check to see if the latter was included in the sections posted at Dragon Times, but if it is, then the URL would be Master Funakoshi's KARATE by Graham Noble or thereabouts); and Samuel Salone, \"Ninjutsu: They Knew All about Poison Gas,\" Japan Times, June 17, 1940, reprinted at vol. II of Journal of Non-Lethal Combatives at Journal of Non-lethal Combatives: Frames page . ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re thinking about some masked Japanese superhero in black, flitting along the rooftops, disappearing at will, dazzling swordsmen, they never existed. Ninjas were assassins and spies, but their powers have been much exaggerated. Movies exaggerate for effect. Do you think American cowboys could shoot so accurately with pistols, Chinese martial arts masters were really able to float along on top of bamboo, or Japanese ninja could do all those incredible feats? That\u2019s the word: incredible, beyond belief. Go ahead, be skeptical. Ninjas died out with the samurai, so by WWII, although the Japanese had spies, the imperialists had no ninja to employ. Their spies and infiltrators were very good. Many spoke excellent Chinese, and if they had something of an accent, well, Chinese people speak in all sorts of accents, so it would have been hard to say for sure that someone was not from some remote area of China. The Chinese developed a very clever test to find them out. They\u2019d observe the suspected Japanese spy washing his face in the morning, and eating. Japanese hold their fingers together when they wash their faces, Chinese splay their fingers. Likewise, Japanese hold their ricebowls with their fingers together, Chinese cup the bowl with fingers apart. From these subtle, unnoticed movements, the Chinese were able to discover infiltrators and spies. ",
