            "answer_text": "Anne and her older sister, Mary, were both born during the reign of Charles II, who had a much better sense of what the English people would accept, and what they wouldn\u2019t, than did his brother James (Anne and Mary\u2019s father). Charles ordered that Anne and Mary should be raised as Anglicans and, since he was king, James had to go along. Anne turned 20 on the day her uncle, Charles II, died and was already married to a protestant prince (George of Denmark). Mary also was married by that time, to the protestant William of Orange so people were not too worried about having a long line of Roman Catholic British monarchs. That changed when James\u2019 second wife, Mary of Modena, gave birth to a son who would, as a male, under the succession laws of the time, take precedence over his sisters. Since both James and Mary of Modena were openly Roman Catholic it was quite clear that the new heir would be raised in that church and it could be expected that his descendants would as well (as in fact they were, until the line died out).
