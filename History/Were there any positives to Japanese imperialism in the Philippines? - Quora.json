            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to find much positive in the Japanese Occupation, which was essentially a disaster for the Philippines in most ways, but some might look at the development of Tagalog (Filipino) as a national language as a plus. With much of the English language press shut down, and with very few Filipinos having command of the Japanese language, the central role in communication fell, almost by default, to Tagalog. I am absolutely not an expert on literary history, but it is my impression that opportunities were created, particularly in journalism, for Filipinos to express themselves more in Philippine languages (and less in English) than they had had before the War. I believe Teodoro Agoncillo was one of the beneficiaries of this shift in emphasis. ",

            "answer_text": "For those that hate the Spanish heritage of the Philippines, probably. Given the fact that a large percentage of the Philippines Spanish speakers were killed during their occupation, leading to today's Philippines being much more Tagalog- and English-speaking people. The lost of Spanish was probably going to happen much slower via language shifting as was already happening, but the Japanese occupation accelerated it. Even so, Spanish was mostly a second language to the Philippines, even when there were Filipinos who fought for independence from both Spaniards and U.S. people that used the Spanish language as their main language and get people motivated for the movement. Today Spanish is officially an optional and voluntary language since the 1987 constitution was adopted and the Philippines still has its Spanish language Academy that was establish back in 1924. ",
