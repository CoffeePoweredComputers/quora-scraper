            "answer_text": "I was a very devout, sincere, and knowledgeable Christian for most of my life. By knowledgeable, I mean that I can quote large passages of Scripture, know what the various books of Scripture deal with, and for many, can even outline by memory a general sketch of what is discussed. I have read the Bible completely through several times. I was a Baptist deacon for over 15 years. I have taught Sunday school. I preached on occasion. Want do discuss theology? I can discuss theology! But then, if you believe what the Bible says and what every denomination of Christianity teaches, when you are \u201csaved\u201d you have the Holy Spirit indwelling you. The Scripture promises that through that indwelling Spirit, the believer will be transformed little by little into the character of Christ. If you believe the Bible, then you know that Jesus promised that \u201cthe gates of Hell\u201d would not prevail against His Church. He promised the Holy Spirit would lead the believers into \u201call truth.\u201d If you believe the Bible, then you know Jesus told his disciples that proof of their love was obedience to his commandments. If you believe the Bible, then you know that Jesus commanded his disciples to love others as they do themselves. And so on. And so forth. All you really have to do is take a good, hard look at most of Christendom today to realize this is bulls***. I\u2019m an American, and I can be excused for looking at Christianity in America. I discovered that most of the doctrines they express are created out of shredded Scripture \u2014 a piece here, a snippet there, cut out that inconvenient phrase there and exclude that scripture altogether. Put it together with preaching and a \u201cthus saith the Lord\u201d and bless it with an Amen and you have a doctrine that will bind the people who don\u2019t have enough education, will, or gumption to figure out that they have been fed a lie. And that was me, too. For a long, long time. I overlooked and excused the excesses and lies of Christians and their leaders \u2014 until finally I could overlook them no longer. If there is a Holy Spirit, it certainly isn\u2019t doing its job. With what? over 30,000 different denominations, sects, splinters, groups, and such \u2014 not counting the independents. All truth? Loving others? Have you seen all the hatred Christians love to pour out on people who disagree with them? And to find out that people you looked up to and trusted were deliberate liars? Yes, the leaders of the Creationist movement are deliberate liars. They know what they are peddling, and it isn\u2019t truth. It is a deception intended to make people dependent on a version of \u201cTruth\u2122\u201d and isolate them from society, making them feel like the special ones \u201cchosen\u201d by God to stand up against the evils of science and all that. Finally, I\u2019d had enough. Christianity by any reasonable measure \u2014 by its own measures! \u2014 is a shambles. The Gates of Hell have won. The Church and its leaders are corrupt. And God does nothing. If there is a God, He isn\u2019t doing one blessed thing to stop people from telling lies in his name. He doesn\u2019t convince Christians to become more loving. He doesn\u2019t do anything. Oh, but Christians have lots of threats available. You don\u2019t believe their unsupported and hypocritical words and you will burn in Hell forever because God loves you so much! Their God is a Monster. My God was a Monster. And so belief waned. It was kinder to God to believe he didn\u2019t exist than to believe he was the kind of God Christians had made him out to be. Mind you, there are quite a few good Christians out there. Many are loving and kind and charitable and accepting of others. But for the most part, Christianity has ceased to be a faith. It is a culture, warped and bloated and distended. I don\u2019t have enough evidence to see it as true, much less that God exists. If God exists and wants me to believe, he will have to actually *do* something tangible, real, and worthy of someone who is God. It isn\u2019t happening now. ",

            "answer_text": "What made me become an atheist? A girl. I had always been questioning religion (and Christianity in particular) since high school so I considered myself an agnostic. 10 years ago, I was dating a girl in college. She was very religious, and I, like I just said, was not. Other than the religion thing, she was probably the girlfriend I clicked with the most. Everyone could tell how strongly I felt about her when I would talk about her. But, like any Greek tragedy, this romance was doomed. Sort of in Othello style, I suppose. One of her closest friends, from what I could gather, more or less convinced her that we wouldn't work out because of the religious disparity. When she brought it up to me, I was as accommodating as I could be without going full-Christian and accepting Jesus (\"I'll go to church with you\" etc.). Mainly because all of the evidence I could find (mainly Jewish arguments against Christianity) made me believe that he was just some dude and not god. Now, for what I could tell she liked me just as much as I liked her, saying that I treated her better than all of her Christian boyfriends. But that wasn't enough. The unspoken lesson -- from this version of Christianity -- was that belief was more important than behavior. How I treated her had no purchase among her friends (and possibly even family; we stayed with her brother and her sister-in-law once so they might have known too). So here we were, in my dorm room, discussing the historical possibility of Christianity. We were at an impasse: She wanted me to become a Christian, I wanted to support her and her religious beliefs without converting. The only option left, in her thought process, was to pray. She layed prostrate across my lap, holding my hands while praying. Praying, begging -- \"PLEASE!\" -- crying her eyes out while pleading for god to drop the scales from my eyes, as it were. Sobbing into my lap, staining my jeans with her tears. It might as well have been tears in the rain, because nothing other than that cloudburst of emotion on her part happened. At the moment, I had a weird mix of emotions. I wanted to be with her, so maybe god -- if he existed -- would do something? But of course nothing of the sort happened. All I did -- all I could do -- was hold her hands. Shortly after that, she left. No longer my girlfriend. I recollected my thoughts. The events of the last hour or so playing over and over in my mind. Maybe I should have done this. Should have said that. What about this angle, or that point of view? And I returned to her almost frantic praying/crying: \"PLEASE!\" I looked that the darkened patch of her tears on my jeans... \"PLEASE!\" Her broken blue eyes telegraphing only one request... \"PLEASE!\" Remembering my own unanswered prayers when I was younger... \"PLEASE!\" \"PLEASE!\" That single request of hers, to her god... to no one... through the memory of the blanket of tears on her face transformed my weird mix of emotions into one, raw, single feeling: God damn rage.  [\"Estuans Interius Ira Vehementi\"] I know many atheists who became so because they were wronged personally by religion. When I was in the military, I felt like an outcast because of my agnosticism. I'm not saying that's not important. I already didn't like religion because of that sort of thing. But this... this was something different. It wasn't me who was made to suffer due to religion this time. It was someone I cared about. And that was beyond the pale. It angered me so much. Even 10 years later, it still boils my blood a bit. Thinking of that 23 year old bawling her eyes out, calling out in the hope that someone was there. And there wasn't. There isn't. Every hope she wants answered, every fear she wants allayed, all of it spent in empty supplication to a being that doesn't exist. And she has to rationalize why no one answers, or invent clever ways that it was answered to save herself from that pain that I witnessed. The tears that she wasted on that fiction, that she emptied into my lap... like tears in the rain. She represents every believer that has ever lived and ever will live. That's what turned me into an atheist. ",
