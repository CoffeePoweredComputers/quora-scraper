            "answer_text": "There are nigh infinite possibilities, but here\u2019s my wish list. (It\u2019s all an imagination game this far out anyway.) Democrat: Hillary Clinton: She thinks she already won. She really really wants this. The Democrat base already thinks she should be president. If Trump proves awful, or even less than brilliant, she will be Ms. I-told-you-so.Joe Biden: The media love Uncle Joe. He\u2019s the goofy-but-amiable guy who seems like an elder statesman when compared to some of the rhetoric being spewed from both sides of the aisle. You just want to like the guy.Dan Lipinski: A Democrat I would vote for. Pro-labor, pro-life, pro-family\u2026 This guy\u2019s got it all. He also appeals to most of what people liked about Donald Trump without being offensive. Will he ever be nominated? No, but if we\u2019re dreaming at this stage, why not add him to the list?Republican: Mitt Romney: Donald Trump without all the baggage and obnoxious behavior. A businessman. A reformed liberal in many respects. A successful governor. If anyone is going to be able to replace Obamacare with something that accomplishes similar goals without killing the private sector, it\u2019s him. The downside? He\u2019s so opposite from Trump in his demeanor that he\u2019s a bit too soft-spoken as a candidate. He\u2019s a lot like Ben Carson, in fact, which leads me to\u2026Ben Carson: If Trump proves unsuccessful, Ben Carson would be another ideal replacement. Carson is a great role-model for the fact that anything is possible for anyone who is willing to put in the work. Plus, he\u2019s a thinker and not just a speech reader. I went to see him at a rally and he simply paced the stage, naming issues and brainstorming about what we could do to fix them. Imagine, a candidate who actually thinks! Like Romney, he\u2019s a restorationist Christian\u2014Mormons and Seventh-day Adventists were both founded by people they believe were prophets in the early 1800s. Also, both groups are often misrepresented, misquoted and taken out of context in order to vilify them for some unknown reason. Is this a liability? Perhaps, but the same thing has been happening to Creedal Christians by other parties for millennia. But I digress\u2026Mike Pence: He\u2019d probably run, but his name would be tainted after serving with Trump. (Again, we are assuming here that Trump wasn\u2019t successful and decided not to run again.) A solid conservative in all respects, at least as far as modern GOP doctrinaires would believe. The track record on privatizing education in Indiana would help him in the primaries but hurt him in the general election. The base would mostly applaud his funding of religious private schools and charters, no matter what the real results proved to be. In the general election, people would discover that Pence exempted private and charter schools from the same testing requirements as public schools because many of the charters had to be shut down due to poor results. It was embarrassing, really. (Sorry, I\u2019m a Hoosier and this is a bit personal for me.)Ted Cruz: Why the heck not? It would be another see-I-told-you-so moment.Donald Trump: If the man is successful, all bets are off. Nobody else needs to run. We elected Trump when we had no clue what he would do. If he does well? We\u2019ll be lucky they passed the Twenty-Second Amendment, or it would be Trump for life.UPDATE: Ben Sasse: He\u2019s smart, educated, and a Trump critic when Trump deserves it. I think a Sasse campaign would have legs.",

            "answer_text": "Assuming (obviously impossibly), that neither major party has an incumbent I think the race will shape up like this: Democrats: In my opinion, 2020 will be the year of the female senator. I think we see a clear woman leader coming out of the senate. It will likely be either Kristen Gillibrand (who I think would be an incredible president) or Amy Kloubacher (whose last name would probably hold her back). The democratic bench on the state level is fairly shallow so don't expect any governors to dominate the conversation. Martin O'Malley has been mentioned but I think he isn't a good fit for the presidency. Also, it seems like all he wants to do is tell stories.  Another governor who may put his hat in the ring is Andrew Cuomo. He'll be sitting pretty if he can win re-election. However, I think he won't run and abandon New York in the middle of his term.  My pick: Kristen Gillibrand  Dark horse: Hillary Clinton's VP (Castro, Kaine, Warner), maybe Tom Wolf, governor of Pennsylvania -Whoever it may be they will be in prime position to take over the votes she receives during the 2016 primary cycle.  Republicans: I expect a race much like the current one. I think the field will be crowded again. -There will be a establishment man in the vein of bush/ Rubio. This will be a centrist governor from a swing state. I think this will fall to Rick Snyder or even a Rick Scott.  -There will be several non-white cadidates in an attempt to show they're diverse. Favorites from this group include Susanna Martinez, Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Cruz act II etc. -A woman: There has to be one, especially if they are running against Hillary. I can see this being filled by Haley or Martinez or maybe a young lively senator by the name of Joni Ernst whose had a remarkable political rise. - A religious crazy: Will Ted Cruz return for a second act? Will Mike Huckabee run for president until the day he does? Find out in four years. New this cycle: Could Jerry Fallwell leave his beloved university to run for president?  -A pure crazy- The Trump strikes back? A Fallwell run fits here too. -A rhino. Nope, sorry, a RINO. A centrist pro-business foreign policy hawk is a sure thing. Will be harvested be the religious right and far fringe in general but will run all the same. Maybe a Republican  senator or governor from a democratic state? I think maybe Bruce Rauner or Charlie Baker.  -A business wo/man: The equivalent of Fiorina (but probably more successful...). For 2020, I predict it will be Robert Urlich, CEO of Target, a common republican donator.  So basically it's a mess. I think it will come down to two candidates: The Establishment and the fringe. I think the fringe will choose Cruz this cycle and I can see no reason for that to change if he keeps being his angry self in the senate. I think they give their nod to Ted. The establishment is harder. I think it will be Rick Scott, governor of Florida or and I think the monetary and organizational power the comes with the establishment will lead him to the general.  Favorite: Rick Scott  Dark Horse(s): Ted Cruz, Joni Ernst, Tim Scott, Rick Snyder Honorable Mention: Jerry Fallwell who could unite the crazy with the very crazy.  THE GENERAL:  We have a battle of a beautiful young woman in Kristen Gillibrand v. a crusty old white guy in Rick Scott (I might be a bit biased). I think the election will be won by Kristen Gillibrand. She's young and connectable to minorities being a democrst, two advantages Scott won't have.  EDIT: Rick Snyder's political career is dead. Count him out. ",
