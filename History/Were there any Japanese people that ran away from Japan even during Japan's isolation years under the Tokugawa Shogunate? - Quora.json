            "answer_text": "I read that some Japanese Christians fled to other countries early in the Edo (Tokugawa) Era. I am not sure how many left the country after that. Japanese were forbidden to leave Japan during this time, anyone caught attempting to do so would have been executed. If any did leave subsequent to that, it was likely on Chinese trading ships out of the Chinese enclave in Nagasaki. Near the end of the Tokugawa Era, some individuals left Japan for various reasons. The Choshu Five were five samurai who secretly left Japan on a British owned ship in 1863 while it was still illegal for any Japanese to do so. They studied in Britain for a few years. All returned to Japan by the end of the 1860s. They all had successful careers. One, Ito Hirobumi was the first prime minister of Japan. Ch\u014dsh\u016b Five - Wikipedia There was another larger group who also left Japan secretly in 1865 known as the Satsuma Fourteen. they studied in England, Europe and the USA Joseph Hardy Neesima - Wikipedia 1843 - 1890 Another who secretly left Japan in 1864. He returned in 1875 and founded a school which later became Doshisha University in Kyoto. In fact, a fair number of Japanese sailors were shipwrecked or carried away from Japanese waters during this time. They were not leaving voluntarily. Don Jessop mentioned John Manjiro who was one of the best known. Others included Dembei - Wikipedia 1670 - 1714 who spent the last part of his life in Russia. Daikokuya K\u014dday\u016b - Wikipedia 1751 - 1828 Spent 11 years in Russia who eventually returned to Japan but was placed under house arrest Otokichi - Wikipedia 1818 - 1867 Also shipwrecked in America. He later settled in Singapore where he died a wealthy man. Oguri Jukichi - Wikipedia 1785 - 1853 One of the first Japanese known to have reached California. in 1813. He was eventually repatriated to Japan and allowed to return to his village. Joseph Heco - Wikipedia 1837 - 1897 picked up by an American ship as a teenager and became the first Japanese to naturalise as a US citizen. He eventually returned to Japan and among other things founded the first Japanese newspaper. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, plenty went to Taiwan, China and beyond. John Manjiro was one such person - not so much running away in his case but he ended up in the US after his fishing boat got shipwrecked. Came back as a famous interpreter for the US delegates. Trades also continued via the Japan Sea to Korea as many cultural items (pottery, food items etc) continued to flow into Japan, so people weren\u2019t so blind to the world beyond its shores. No doubt some were curious enough to try venture out. ",
