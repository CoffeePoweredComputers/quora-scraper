            "answer_text": "When Edwarda O\u2019Bara died on 21 November 2012, she had survived 15,663 days (about 42 years) in a coma. Born in 1953, in Miami, Florida, O\u2019Bara suffered a childhood history of diabetes, which she successfully managed with insulin. But when, in December 1969, she contracted pneumonia the two illnesses together proved too much for her 16-year-old body and she slipped into diabetic coma on 3 January 1970. Edwarda\u2019s parents continued to care for her until her father died in 1976 and her mother eventually passed away in 2008. After this, her younger sister Colleen assumed responsibility. Edwarda\u2019s 59th birthday in April 2012 was celebrated by thousands of well-wishers. She died later that year. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the level of coma the range would vary greatly. In the worst case, It could be 2-5 minutes. Best case could be till the end of their remaining natural life as long as proper medical support is there (like feeding tube, life support if needed etc. etc.) Some people go into a state of coma known as \"vegetative state\". At this stage, most fundamental biological mechanics (breathing, blood pressure, food processing etc. etc.) Processes continue to operate even though the person could be completely unconscious and even the most powerful stimuli like pain would not be able to wake them up. At this stage, it is possible to survive with proper support till the remaining natural life unless the patient emerges from coma prior to that. However statistically, most people do not survive more than four weeks in a coma. ",
