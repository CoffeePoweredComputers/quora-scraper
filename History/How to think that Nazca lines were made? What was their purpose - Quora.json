            "answer_text": "According to the pseudo science, it was ancient astronauts who used these trails to explore earth. Sometimes , it feels excited and nice to hear . Thinking in other way, this fact is true because we from earth have been exploring various planetory systems . Hence for moon people ( if existed) we are aliens.  What does this on nazca represent , can we think him as a space person . But at the same time nazca lines cannot be viewed from the ground . It means that the ancient knows the art of flying and calculating elevations . Surprising right! . Thats a common sense. This question is not quite so easy to answer, for there are dozens of theories and no conclusive hard evidence to point to one absolutely. Why would these ancient people make drawings so huge that they could not be appreciated from the ground, but only fully from above? Perhaps that was the point; they were intended for the eyes of the gods, as a sort of offering to them. The Nazcan\u2019s were very religious, and much of their life revolved around the growing of crops. Their very lives depended on it, and no doubt they wanted to insure the good will of the gods. Or perhaps there was a more practical purport to the seemingly pointless lines in the desert? Johan Reinhard, an archaeologist known for his research on Incan ice mummies, postulated that the lines were sacred pathways to a place from which the people worshiped the mountains as the source of water, and invoked the mountain gods. Many of the lines seem to be made for walking upon, being the width of a footpath, and made of one single continous line. The animal figures, he proposed, were the manifestations of the mountain gods, who were believed to take the form of different animals and to have controlled certain animals. The Andean people still worship the gods of the mountains today. The figures were made so large in order that the mountain gods, who presumably existed above, might view them. Conclusion :Whether made by the landing gears of alien spacecrafts, a homage to the gods, a sacred pathway meant for worship, or more simply a means to mark the sources of precious water to for the Nazca, the lines, figures, and animals that are etched upon the barren Peruvian plain, continue to inspire us to inquire about the past, to wonder at what was accomplished before the advent of modern technology and living, and remind us that there are forces we will never be able to understand within this universe. Life would be a lot less interesting if there were no mysteries to unravel. ",
