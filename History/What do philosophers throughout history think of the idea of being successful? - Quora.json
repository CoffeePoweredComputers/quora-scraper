            "answer_text": "It may be that something is getting lost in translation regarding the particular word \"success,\" because this topic and other closely related ones were the subject of much activity in classical Greek philosophy, for example. Success may be a modern invention to the limited extent that we have ideas about it now which are specific to the times and the culture, but at its root it is an ancient and almost universal concept, understandably.  The word that is most often used in the canon of ancient philosophy is  \u03b5\u1f50\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1, eudaimonia, which is translated literally as \"good spirits.\" It is difficult to capture its meaning succinctly in English because it is an idiomatic expression the content of which is multifaceted; simplistically, we could say that it entails \"living well,\" \"having a clear conscience,\" and/or \"being successful.\" Eudaimonia isn't an atomic idea, but a sort of molecular compound idea whose constituent components are mixed and matched differently depending on the source.  Plato tells us that the Socratic conception of eudaimonia is rather ascetic or minimalist in nature. For Socrates, the only truly necessary condition of eudaimonia is excellence -- primarily excellence in personal conduct (moral behavior based is clear reasoning). This is the example which Socrates is supposed to have made of himself by submitting to his own execution in Plato's Apology; though Socrates was offered an \"out\" from his predicament, he did not feel he could take it in good conscience since it would have amounted to an admission of guilt which he did not feel was warranted. Submitting to his persecutors for the sake of saving his own skin would have destroyed his eudaimonia, so it was better to submit to death instead.  For Plato this idea was troublesome, and he devoted much of his working life to figuring out exactly why it was troublesome and what could be done about it. One of his favorite parables is the fable of the Ring of Gyges. Gyges found purely by luck a magic ring which could turn its wearer invisible, allowing him to do whatever he wanted absolutely undetected (this should be familiar to Tolkien fans). Ever the ambitious type, Gyges used the ring to murder the King of Lydia and take his place. There was no cause for external shame, as to everyone but Gyges it simply appeared that he was in the right place at the right time -- so is this not eudaimonia? The thrust of the argument is that while Socrates' claim that eudaimonia is largely a matter of moral behavior and a clear conscience seems noble and right on the surface, in reality it is precisely the need to behave as just and moral agents which keeps us from ever truly attaining eudaimonia. We cannot really get at it precisely because we must keep ourselves in check to some extent as members of a social collective.  Plato makes this argument as a means of playing devil's advocate for purposes of investigating the problem -- he does not seem to genuinely believe that eudaimonia amounts to doing whatever one wants. For instance in Republic Plato asserts that while power is conferred by wealth, virtue is certainly not; the moral value of a man's wealth consists in how he obtains it and what he does with it for the betterment of those around him. Plato came to focus most keenly on the \"clear conscience\" element of eudaimonia. The concept for Plato came to mean a lack of moral conflict and guilt within oneself.  Of all the ancient Greeks, the depiction of eudaimonia which is likely to seem most practical to modern minds is that of Aristotle. He agreed to an extent with his teacher Plato that there could be no eudaimonia as long as one was ridden with guilt or inner turmoil, but also observed that it was possible to possess a clean conscience and still be in a poor condition otherwise. Therefore he espoused a more blended and wordly conception of \"success,\" stressing the role of arete or excellence but not in a purely moral sense -- for Aristotle a certain measure of wealth, good health, sound friendships, and other worldly factors were also necessary ingredients.  As Ernest has said, in the ancient East notions about success were, in typical fashion, usually more pragmatic. This was changed, though, by the influence of classical Buddhism in which success is largely equated with the elimination of dukkha which is generally taken to mean \"anxiety arising from desires.\" Here we have a formulation probably far more austere even than that of Socrates: success is not a matter of setting goals according to one's desires and then achieving them -- this is a cycle the completion of which is purely illusory for the Buddhists, since having attained one thing, we simply go on to want others -- but is rather a question of eliminating the desires altogether. This is a prerequisite for enlightenment in the Buddhist worldview, to an extent sufficiently strong such that enlightenment itself cannot really be obtained if it is \"desired\" in the same way that one might desire wealth or popularity.    Maybe the most notable leap forward in the philosophical discussion of success, at least in the West, came with Nietzsche in the mid-19th century and then the existentialists after him. Nietzsche's position is not unlike that proffered by Plato with his story of Gyges and the magic ring. People are inhibited in their potential for excellence and personal success by their implicit acceptance of a \"slave\" or \"herd\" mentality imposed on them by the collective (part of what Socrates would call \"moral\" behavior). For Nietzsche, we often suppress desires where we should entertain them, and we do this for the purpose of upholding some purportedly objective greater good which is in reality only a mythology spun out of thin air in order to uphold a status quo in the world, with the result that very few of us are authentically human agents of our own creation. Nietzsche is well aware that following this worldview to its logical extremes would mean a scenario in which \"might makes right\" and in which altruism in any appreciable form might seem pointless. At times he appears to be okay with this, and at other points he seems to consider it a serious problem.  For the modern existentialists (and here I speak most pointedly of Simone de Beauvoir and perhaps also Camus), the answer to the quandary dredged up by Nietzsche is that people do need to freely fulfill themselves, but they ought to do it such that the limiting factor is to fulfill the self only in ways that create or nurture possibilities for others to do the same as well. You may notice that this is essentially the same problem as Plato's puzzlement over whether or not to use the magic ring, only expressed in different terms. And those terms make a difference.  At the root of existentialism is a notion of an extreme self-responsibility which is the inseparable result of the condition of basic human freedom. That is, for any question one asks about why one believes or does a particular thing, the only authentic answer which can be found at the end of the line of questioning is, \"Because I choose to.\" For Camus this freedom and responsibility are couched in the ultimate meaninglessness (absurdit\u00e9) of existence as a blank slate upon which the individual must build meaning; de Beauvoir's view I take to be both more nuanced and more vague.  If I might be permitted to close by simplifying and paraphrasing even more than I already have, it is worth noting the basic procedure outlined by de Beauvoir according to which the pursuit of success is engaged, along with the potential dangers to be avoided or circumvented at each step: The subject identifies and then embraces fully a lack, and sets about the fulfillment of this lack. This lack can occur in a variety of forms and concerns: \"I don't have enough money to get by,\" \"I'm sad all the time,\" \"I have a broken relationship with my parent/spouse/sibling/child,\" etc. One of the dangers at this step is that the perceived lack may be inauthentic, that is, it might be a condition imposed by the culture but not really internally felt by the subject; another is that the subject may be unwittingly cowering in denial of the existence of a lack and might therefore miss it entirely, or may misunderstand the relationships between various lacks and might misprioritize or misinterpret them. Then the subject sets about the fulfillment of this lack, the process of which de Beauvoir calls the project. Crucially, this project cannot involve the purposeful erosion of the opportunities of others, or come pointedly at their expense: for example, I wouldn't set about obtaining enough money to get by through stealing from others, and I wouldn't set about making myself happier by deciding to take pleasure in the misfortunes of my enemies. Apart from the possibility that the project might entail such deviant means, there are a number of dangers identified at this step. One of them is that the subject may become fanatical about the project itself, and seek to force the project on others, thus curtailing their own inherent possibilities -- de Beauvoir sees this as the (un)ethical basis of 20th century fascism and ideological totalitarianism in all forms. Another is that the subject may devolve into a kind of addiction to fulfillment of the project such that he becomes blind to other lacks, as warned against in step (1). Having completed the project and fulfilled the lack, the subject then takes inventory again, identifies and embraces a new lack, designs a new project, and thus repeats the process. The authentic and successful life, then, according to this conception, is neither really the achievement of a telos or end goal nor is it simply a static inner harmony; it is more like a healthy sense of forward motion carried out in such a way that the rest of the world is in some measure swept along with it, while the subject never comes to identify fulfillment with a state of rest or repose.

            "answer_text": "Most of the philosophers who might have criticized success, probably only criticized particular interpretations of success not the idea of success more broadly. Learning and self-development would be significant values in most philosopher's assessment.  Moreover, life as a journey of maturity, character, service, and leadership. Well, arguably I think Plato was very much concerned with moving from the real to the ideal (see also allegory of the cave).  Achieving at our highest levels and achieving excellence was definitely a concern I think--perhaps for Plato and very much so with Aristotle. The alternatives to achievement and excellence on the one hand and thriving and well being on the other--seem to be stagnation.  I don't think many philosophers when actually confronted with lack of individual and collective growth and improvement are actually for stagnation.  Such, would undermine the very purposes truth seeking purposes of education, inquiry, and philosophy in the first place. ",
