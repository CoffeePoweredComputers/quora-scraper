            "answer_text": "? See Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, pretty much all of Europe are majority white nations. The United States, if you forgot, was invaded and conquered by white Europeans - essentially becoming a country for \u201cwhite\u201d people. Same was done in South Africa and many other colonized nations. Your question is one of majority vs minority. Whites are a minority worldwide but they control the majority of wealth. Slowly, that is changing. Basically, this question does not reflect reality although there can be disdain for white people in certain countries. I doubt they would be barred living there. ",
