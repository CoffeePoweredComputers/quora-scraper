            "answer_text": "Yes \u2026! They certainly very helpful. Because Ignou Study materials are prepared by the best in the field. They are prepared by Phd holders. Infact many candidates who have passed UPSC exams have given credit to Ignou. Because they were simultaneously studying some PG course from Ignou or were past candidates on Ignou. Surf the web. Many passed candidates have been interviewed by Times of India. And they have mentioned Ignou\u2019s study materials as their best friend. I thinks its due to the fact that Ignou\u2019s study materials are prepared for self study. So they are easy to understand. Plus they don\u2019t compromise with quality. And they are also available on their egyankosh website. Its FREE for all. You can download them or buy them from their study centre/regional centre (present in every Big city) for a small price. I have personally read Ignou study materials for MAsters in Economics and Public Administration. I really liked them. Ignou is a university created by the Act of parliament 1985. Beware of other fake universities. ",

            "answer_text": "IGNOU notes for any subject help immensely while preparing for any optional. For one , they give you a good idea of what the subject matter constitutes and secondly, they are the base on which you start preparing your optional. You start reading other books after you are done with reading IGNOU notes. However, not all modules of the notes are useful for the UPSC optional, so always read selectively. ",
