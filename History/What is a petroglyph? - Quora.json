            "answer_text": "Petroglyphs are rock carvings (rock paintings are called pictographs) made by pecking directly on the rock surface using a stone chisel and a hammerstone. When the desert varnish (or patina) on the surface of the rock was chipped off, the lighter rock underneath was exposed, creating the petroglyph. Outside North America, scholars often use terms such as \"carving\", \"engraving\", or other descriptions of the technique to refer to such images. Petroglyphs are found worldwide, and are often associated with prehistoric peoples. The word comes from the Greek prefix petro-, from \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 petra meaning \"stone\", and \u03b3\u03bb\u03cd\u03c6\u03c9 gl\u00fdph\u014d meaning \"to carve\", and was originally coined in French as p\u00e9troglyphe. Petroglyphs are designed from removing rock in such ways as scratching, abrading, pecking, carving, drilling, incising, and sculpting. Locations of choice are rock facets coated with patina, a dark mineral accumulation on rock surfaces. Petroglyphs remove the patina, exposing the contrasting lighter rock interior. Instances of negative images, produced by removing the patina surrounding the intended figure, are also known. Sometimes petroglyphs are painted or accentuated by polishing. The degree of repatination indicates relative dating. Some of the most ancient petroglyphs are the same color as the surrounding rock. From present-day cultures that continue to create rock art, archaeologists have learned that petroglyphs were made by using a handheld stone as a chisel or hammer to etch designs into boulders. Pictographs, however, were more complex to make because of the materials required for paint. Red pigments, which generally make up the most common color found in rock paintings, were made from iron oxides. Other minerals used to create colors were talc, gypsum, or lime for white; charcoal or graphite for black; and copper ores for greens and blues. These minerals were ground into fine powders, then mixed with a resin, such as pine pitch. An oil base was sometimes added by grinding certain seeds or melting animal fat. Paints were applied either by fingers or with brushes made from animal fur, fibrous plant leaves, or the shredded end of a stick.  Rock carving known as Meerkatze, rampant lionesses in Wadi Mathendous, Mesak Settafet region of Libya.  European petroglyphs: Laxe dos carballos in Campo Lameiro, Galicia, Spain (4th\u20132nd millennium BCE), depicting cup and rings and deer hunting scenes  Petroglyph of a camel; Negev, southern Israel Rock art is very difficult to date. However, some experts can estimate how quickly paints fade or how much time has passed since a carving was made into a rock. These methods can be used to place an approximate date on a pictograph or a petroglyph. These tests are infrequently used because they require the work of an expert who has access to specialized equipment and methods of testing. The oldest petroglyphs in prehistoric rock carving are the Bhimbetka Petroglyphs in the Auditorium cave situated at Bhimbetka in India. Excavations at a sister site (Daraki-Chattan) have confirmed that the petroglyphs were created between 290,000 and 700,000 BCE, during the Acheulian period of the Lower Paleolithic. Blombos cave drawings (c.70,000 BCE) comprised of Abstract engravings on ochre rock, 200 miles east of Capetown, South Africa, representing some of the oldest art yet found. Cupules are non-functional cup-shaped depressions found on a rock surface which are created by a number of human blows. The rock surface at cupule-sites usually shows microscopic signs of percussion, such as particles of crushed material, surface bruising, and occasionally signs of tool marks. They are most common type of petroglyph in the world. It is impossible to generalize but may have been related to the technology in petroglyph carving. A cupule, for instance, is a fundamentally different type of rock marking from a rock carving or an animal engraving. As yet, no archeologist has provided a coherent explanation for the creation of cupules, while other types of rock engraving may serve as territorial maps or markers (geocontourglyph), or ritualistic, religious, totemic or linguistic markings.  The oldest known Stone art.A cupule at the Auditorium Cave atBhimbetka, Madhya Pradesh, India.It dates from (290,000-700,000 BCE) Petroglyphs are an important form of pre-writing symbols, used in communication dating to approximately the Neolithic and late Upper Paleolithic boundary, about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. Around 7,000 to 9,000 years ago, other writing systems such as pictographs and ideograms began to appear. Petroglyphs were still common though, and some less advanced societies continued using them much longer, even until contact with Western culture was made in the 20th century. Petroglyphs have been found in all parts of the globe except Antartica with highest concentrations in parts of Africa, Scandinavia, Siberia, southwestern North America, and Australia. There are many theories to explain their purpose, depending on their location, age, and the type of image. Some petroglyphs are thought to be astronomical markers, maps, and other forms of symbolic communication, including a form of \"pre-writing\" They might also have been a by-product of other rituals: sites in India, for example, have been identified as musical instruments or \"rock gongs.\" Some petroglyph images probably had deep cultural and religious significance for the societies that created them; in many cases this significance remains for their descendants. Many petroglyphs are thought to represent some kind of not-yet-fully understood symbolic or ritual language. Later glyphs from the Nordic Bronze Age in Scandanavia seem to refer to some form of territorial boundary between tribes, in addition to possible religious meanings. It also appears that local or regional dialects from similar or neighboring peoples exist. The Siberian inscriptions almost look like some early form of runes, although there is not thought to be any relationship between them. They are not yet well understood. Ancient petroglyphs do not have \"signatures\" because they were produced before written words were invented. So, they cannot be attributed to a specific person. However, petroglyphs can sometimes be attributed to a specific group of people who inhabited or passed through the area where the petroglyphs occur. The rocks are typically in a location where it can be easily seen by anyone who passes by. The images may have been made at different times because they exhibit different degrees of weathering. Some may have been made by some of the early people to inhabit this area, others could have been made by people who passed through hundreds of years later, or they could have been made recently. Some researchers have noticed the resemblance of different styles of petroglyphs across different continents; while it is expected that all people would be inspired by their surroundings, it is harder to explain the common styles. This could be mere coincidence, an indication that certain groups of people migrated widely from some initial common area, or indication of a common origin. Other theories suggest that petroglyphs were made by shamans in an altered state of consciousness, perhaps induced by the use of natural hallucinogens. Many of the geometric patterns (known as form constants) which recur in petroglyphs and cave paintings have been shown to be \"hard-wired\" into the human brain; they frequently occur in visual disturbances and hallucinations brought on by drugs, migraine, and other stimuli. The term petroglyph should not be confused with petrograph, which is an image drawn or painted on a rock face. Both types of image belong to the wider and more general category of rock art or parietal art. Petroforms, or patterns and shapes made by many large rocks and boulders over the ground, are also quite different. Inuksit are also unique, and found only in the Arctic (except for reproductions and imitations built in more southerly latitudes). Another form of petroglyph, normally found in literate cultures, or rock-cut relief is a relief sculpture carved on \"living rock\" such as a cliff, rather than a detached piece of stone. While these relief carvings are a category of rock art, sometimes found in conjunction with rock-cut architecture, they tend to be omitted in most works on rock art, which concentrate on engravings and paintings by prehistoric or nonliterate cultures. Some of these reliefs exploit the rock's natural properties to define an image. Rock reliefs have been made in many cultures, especially in the Ancient Near East. Rock reliefs are generally fairly large, as they need to be to make an impact in the open air. Most have figures that are larger than life-size.Stylistically, a culture's rock relief carvings relate to other types of sculpture from period concerned. A pictograph is a drawing or painting that is created on a rock. Because they are merely a surface coating, pictographs tend to be less durable than petroglyphs. The ones that survive are most often found in caves, rock shelters, and areas with dry climates.A variety of pigments have been used to make pictographs. Examples of these pigments include pieces of charcoal from a campfire; blood from hunted or sacrificed animals; and rock or mineral materials such as chalk, limonite or hematite.  A pair of red club shaped symbols(claviforms), AltaMira Cave , Spain.They are dated to at least 34,000 BCE. During the Stone Age, most artworks including pictographs/pictograms were created inside rock shelters or deep caves. This parietal art consisted of four main types, listed here in order of age: abstract symbols, hand stencils (handprints or palm-prints), rick engravings (painted or unpainted), and cave paintings (monochrome or polychrome). This cave art was not \"art for art's sake\", but a means of expression with a shamanistic, or ceremonial, or hunting function. If this is true then all these different types of imagery qualify as pictographs. As it happens, most of the abstract symbols are to be found around or actually inside the paintings of animal figures, almost as if they are providing a primitive commentary on the illustrations. Thus we may have to consider the art \"as a whole\" rather than separating it into types.  \"The Shaft Scene\" Lascaux Caves.Paleolithic scholars continue to debate the meaning of these early prehistoric pictographs. Images had a variety of meanings, which varied from region to region. In any event, it is worth emphasizing that, as a rule, decorated caves were not occupied by domestic inhabitants. Indeed, judging by the lack of footprints and other signs of human presence, only a small group of artists and other decision-makers ever ventured inside. This leads credence to the idea of the prehistoric cave as a sanctuary or sacred place, and the paintings as an iconographic backdrop for whatever ceremony or ritual was performed therein. Unfortunately, no one knows exactly what kind of ceremonial activity might have occurred. But two basic possibilities suggest themselves. First, given the overwhelming visual effect of the animal figures, engraved, drawn or painted in almost every cave, it is clear that Paleolithic art is essentially the art of the hunter. Thus the cave paintings might be interpreted as a primitive type of hunting \"wish-list\". Dangerous predators (such as lions and bears) might have been pictorialized in order to demonize or cast spells upon them, in the way that voodoo dolls are first made then pierced with pins and the like. (Chauvet Cave paintings, for instance.) Game animals hunted for food might have been pictorialized in order to improve hunting prospects. (Lascaux Cave paintings.) Second, given the fact that these small groups of humans kept going into these (deep and dark) caves for thirty thousand years, not to live or shelter there, but to draw on the walls, something significant must have been going on. And since time immemorial, the dark - and especially the underground dark - has been seen as a sort of supernatural realm, harbouring any number of spirits in contact with higher powers. Furthermore, the influence of \"shamans\" - witchdoctor-type individuals in contact with the spirit world - was a widespread cultural phenomenon among Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherer societies. (the \"Sorcerer\" in the Trois Freres Cave c.13,000 BCE.) Therefore it seems reasonable to agree with archeologists Jean Clottes and David Lewis-Williams (Clottes & Lewis-Williams, 1998) who suggest that Shamanism is at the root of this Stone Age art and that early humans may have regarded the cave as a bridge between this world and the next. This \"supernatural\" interpretation is the only one which explains the lack of visitors to the cave: people were probably too terrified by voodoo-type fears and superstitions to enter. Among the less portentous explanations of ancient art inside caves, please note the recent extensive study into the meaning of hand stencils, conducted by Paul Pettitt of the University of Sheffield. Pettitt demonstrates that the handprints were quite often created in places that were difficult to reach. He suggests that a possible interpretation of this is that they represented navigational pictographs in dimly lit caves, giving advice such as \"do not use this passageway\".
