            "answer_text": "Hello, Ms. Jha, and thanks for the A2A! What am I old-fashioned about\u2026? Nearly everything. I do all my own cooking from scratch, even pancakes and such. I don\u2019t eat fast food. Even though I\u2019m not a Christian, I still wonder if removing the morning prayer and Bible reading from elementary schools was a good idea. I feel part of our culture was censored. I dress conservatively, and never wear shorts, tank tops or miniskirts in public. Even as a teenager, I refused to wear such things. I dress nicely even to travel, and consider a professional appearance to be more important than my personal comfort. I don\u2019t care for Political Correctness\u2026 at all. I think it\u2019s dishonest. I write in longhand (\u201ccursive\u201d), and think people who don\u2019t are lazy, and people who can\u2019t are poorly educated. I firmly believe you can judge a person not only by the grammar he uses, but by the scope of his vocabulary as well. Basically, I live as if it were 1960. If I\u2019m not behaving as if it\u2019s 1960, I\u2019m acting as if it\u2019s 1890. One or the other, depending on the circumstances. You are very lucky I\u2019m not in your family so you don\u2019t have to put up with me! ",
