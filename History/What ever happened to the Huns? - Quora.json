            "answer_text": "In a nutshell: The tribe and their identity disappeared from history. The identity \u201cHun\u201d was thrown away after the death of Attila and the deformation of the Hunnic empire, no one can claim to be a \u201cHun\u201d or a descendant of them, for one certain reason. The people who were identified as Huns themselves merged and married into surrounding tribes. It is unknown whom exactly, but since they settled on the Danube river it can be assumed they merged into local tribes such as the Goths or Franks. Now, the sudden deformation and disappearance of their empire is usually attributed to Attila\u2019s sons, especially his heir, Ellac, who divided the empire with his brothers, leading it to ruin and seperation. It should be noted that the Huns were not one specific identity, they were a group of warriors from different local tribes who united creating the Hunnic identity, thus those warriors and their descendants, sensing weakness in the empire split from it and went back to their tribes and their native identity. Local Hunnic rule ended and the Huns disappeared from historical records, never to be mentioned again. The reason why they weren\u2019t mentioned again was because they left no sign to be remembered, other fallen empires such as Romans, Byzantines, Persians, Palmyrenes, Greeks, Egyptians, etc.. left grand monuments and well preserved cities that will make them remembered for millenials to come. The Huns, Mongols and other centeral Asian tribes who expanded their borders are only remembered for destruction and ruin, but they left no sign, no cultural impact, no legacy behind. The Huns for one didn\u2019t have buildings, didn\u2019t write records, didn\u2019t create art nor beauty that would be enough for them to be remembered. When people think of Romans they think: \u201cThey were those artists, sculptors that built monuments around the world and left a huge cultural legacy\u201d but when people think of Huns it\u2019s usually: \u201cThey were those people that threatned Rome and destroyed cities and massacred citizens only to be never heard of again\u201d. Notice the difference? I wonder how would anyone want to be associated with the Huns or would even want to claim them as his/her ancestors if they aren\u2019t absolutely clueless about them in history. ",

            "answer_text": "According to our Chronicles: After death of Atilla there came an infight spurred by Gothic and German tribes with them taking one side of the Huns. Through this a lot of them dies and Csaba the smallest son (this is a title likely, not a name but became a name later here) was prophetized to be the one who will keep the kingdom through history. He did not die, but weakened after infighting he first flee to around todays Bulgaria trough Transylvania where the \u201cSz\u00e9kely\u201d people settled (that is what their name mean) until he goes back to find Magyar tribes and prepare for reoccupation of the Golden corner (which is the carpathian basin). Scythians / Sz\u00e9kely people then built up the ancient t\u00fcnder-castles in Transylvania and waited while holding ground and Csaba and his people went back to the East for his search for Magyar tribes. Prior to this, Hunor and Magor were two brothers and sons of Nimr\u00f3d. They were originally born in land of \u201cEvil\u00e1t\u201d after Nimr\u00f3d left at the first sight of human language will start confusing into multiple languages so to not wait for this to happen. Hunor and Magor hunted a wonderstag (wonderdeer) which lead to \u201cMeotisz\u201d swampland where they mated with daughters of a really old local \u201ct\u00fcnd\u00e9r\u201d king. When Atilla was on his campaigns this is where many of the Magyar tribes still was settled at as a known reserve. We have a tale about the Golden corner that practically all Scythian tribes concentrate their effort for holding because it is and will be \u201cthe last golden corner of the r\u00e1ma of the world\u201d. Csaba and his people reunited with Magyars here and some generations later issued an attack to reconquer the carpathian basin. This is time of \u201c\u00c1lmos\u201d (literally meaning \u201cdreamer\u201d) who had seen in his dream how the golden corner looks. Seven tribes went on and through a long journey arrived in the Carpathian basin where the scouts have found a Hungarian speaking population, but some others like the eastern frank empire (latinized people) and some others who some say slavs, some say others. Avars (meaning fallen leaves) were also holding their ground a bit here and there like around Gy\u0151r where they had a ring-wall castle (gy\u0171r\u0171 in Hungarian) and this is why the Avars have named the place after their ring. Most of Avars (fallen leaves of Huns who weakened but not went back with Csaba, neither dig them in in Transylvania) however were already conquered by said Moravian and Eastern Frank forces and some of the old artifacts have been stolen too as gold relics and moved to the west. Last reconquer happened around 895. From that on and to this day it is still Hungary. All chronicles and even foreign sources never deny this until XIXth century but then Hungary was under occupation and under a forced viewpoint of weaking their identity. Also should be mentioned that the Empire of Atilla was unlike Empires like the Roman one with homogenization. It had one of the main goals to crush Rome when they conquered the carpathian basin and even then only attacked further after some kings artifact was stolen near the Tisza river. Also anyone was accepted to be part of this empire without giving up their own identity so many Goths, Turkish tribes or Proto-turks, various mongoloids took part in this too - alongside all the slaves who ran away from the Roman empire who were pretty big in number too. It was and always will be a war on homogenization and against empires. The so called \u201chunnic empire\u201d was more of a \u201cbig-kingdom\u201d and an alliance of tribes. We call Atilla to be \u201cnagykir\u00e1ly\u201d for example. In any ways. Many people will claim to descend from this Hunnic empire in a way from Bulgarians where Csaba stopped while going back to the east and likely some left him there, through Turks who moved to the south between the seas to occupy where they live now in biggest numbers and even some Bajor (Boi-Avar) can relate them to Europian Huns. Also Huns and Szaka (east word for szittya or Scythian) have affected some of the far east cultures and some of thei religious and historical leaders had a lineage, while Ujghur and some other nationalities like the Hunza and such are related too. Some heritage is available in Poland through Sarmatians taking part in this and also being related Scythian tribes and other nations all along the steppe until Mongoloid and Turkish invasions drove them out. But even after that because of the Turks minor connection it did not die out completely. Also Scythians and Huns spread around a lot of things in Europe: like using proper pants instead of Toga and such things. Sarmatian and Scythian people as mercanaries even ended up affecting todays Britain through the Roman empire and likely related to the Artur mythology too as far as we know it and the sounding of their names\u2026 Huns did not disappear and not only traces are around, but there is a nation with clear heritage from them and clear effort to keep it up too ;-) ",
