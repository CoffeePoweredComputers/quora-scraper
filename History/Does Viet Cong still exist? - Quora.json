It had both guerrilla and and later had fully equipped and trained regular army units, as well as a network of cadres who organized peasants in the territory it controlled, often recruiting locals to moblise to the urban areas to perform as spies while working as servants or domestic staff in key southern people\u2019s homes, thereby providing regular channels of information to Hanoi (for example, the Hanoi government knew about the code to be broadcast on Radio Saigon (Bing Crosby singing \u201cI\u2019m Dreaming of a White Christmas (in April/May) before all of the people it was intended to warn were fully briefed). The current official Vietnamese history of the war states that \"The Liberation Army of South Vietnam [Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng] is a part of the People's Army of Vietnam\", having been absorbed as regular units after the war\u2026.with many manning re-education camps or tracking down those who were considered security risks or traitors, due to their unassailable loyalty. Despite the fact that so many were listed as serving in the Viet Cong, it is virtually impossible to find any of them now as they themselves went through a process when they were de-mobilised out of regular military units, and many are still reluctant to discuss their activities during the war.

            "answer_text": "The answer very much depends on whether or not you are a Vietnamese or non-Vietnamese. For non-Vietnamese, the National Liberation Front (NLF) aka Viet Cong ceased to exist in 1976 after the reunification of Vietnam. Most of its members joined the then-renamed Vietnamese Communist Party (previously Workers Party of Vietnam.) For many Vietnamese, especially the people who used to live in the South Vietnam, the Viet Cong still exists, as the name Viet Cong has been used to indicate all people affiliated with the Communists (even people who have never been card-carrying member of the Communist Party) even before the First Indochina War (1946\u20131954). In many overseas Vietnamese communities, people use the name to refer to the current government in Vietnam. ",
