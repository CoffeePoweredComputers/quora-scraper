            "answer_text": "The Second Great Awakening is synonymous with a few of its results: BaptistsThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons)Church of ChristMethodistsother Restoration and Primitivist churches (Adventists, AME), basically all the churches that weren\u2019t Catholicism or directly from the Reformationand the above\u2019s focus on personal salvation, your personal journey, reading your own scriptures, and your personal relationship with God\u2014instead of a focus on rules and clergy. I\u2019m not saying there were less rules and clergy, but the clergy became counselors in-a-process more than arbitrators-of-god\u2019s-will. This is part of what brought America the expectation of having 1 church for every 500\u20131000 people. Anywhere else we\u2019re still talking 1:10,000.Millennnialism/Postmillennialism - any version of there being 1000 years after the year 2000 where the world is perfectedchange in women\u2019s roles in churches that otherwise would not have happened, eventually the women\u2019s rights movementProhibition (just picture Guys & Dolls)on those notes, really what we now call activism.emotion in church\u2014not a bunch of neverending logical debates trying to prove God, but churches that were true because of how they feltNew England\u2019s culture taking over churches: simple things like folding your arms when you prayMinority churches. Black people are Methodists or Baptists because Methodism and Baptism preached to them heavily in this window, and gave them positions and ordinations of authority when other churches didn\u2019t. This is a big part of what ended slavery (a lot of things ended slavery, with almost constant legislation being sponsored from 1776 until it passed 90 years later, but having the black population increasingly organized and educated via the churches was a big part of it.)The second great awakening, and its population boom, may be a big reason why America is so religious comparatively to this day.",
