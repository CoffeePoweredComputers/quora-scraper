No, they did not. Their assumption was that after Pearl Harbor the US would roll over and negotiate. They were surprised when the US did not. After their tremendous initial success, they were stunned when the US defeated the Imperial Navy at Midway, and astonished at the ferocity with which the US defended, attacked and counter-attacked them. Their propaganda was that the Americans were cowards with no fighting spirit. The Japanese government made no attempt what-so-ever to contact the US government about the status of the war until July, 1945. If you know of such an attempt, please supply citations and detailed supporting information so that we can all see what actually happened, there are many incorrect rumors and myths about this. ",

Or, was it an all or nothing deal? The people who start the war rarely ask for peace while they\u2019re winning. In fact, I don\u2019t recall that ever happening. It\u2019s not an \u201call or nothing deal\u201d, it\u2019s how winning and losing work in a shooting war. Besides, asking for peace talks suggest a weakness the opponent isn\u2019t aware of. It usually makes your opponent think things are changing to their benefit so they can fight some more. ",
