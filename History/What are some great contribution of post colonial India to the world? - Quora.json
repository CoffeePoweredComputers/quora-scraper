            "answer_text": "The decade after the end of the second world war was a time when imperialism ended, and former colonies became independent. Most of these soon became right or left wing dictatorships as democracies collapsed. That includes countries like Korea and Vietnam (where both halves became dictatorships), Taiwan, Indonesia, Philippines, Pakistan, Burma, just to name a few in Asia. The world had given India less than a decade before it too went that way and broke up into a dozen or more nations. We had all the centrifugal forces. Divisions based on caste, language, religion, widely different cultures, and topped with poor literacy, permanent food shortages, average life span of 38 years.  The acts that led to India maturing into not only a functioning, but a thriving republic is a learning for the world.

The challenges were external (wars with China and Pakistan) and internal (just mentioning the bullet points will run into pages). ",
