            "answer_text": "Being born and raised Jewish I encountered anti-Semitism to a small degree growing up in the 1940s through the 60s, and while not horribly threatened or inconvenienced by it, I still had difficulty understanding what it was about. I remember having several long talks with my father on the topic. It is quite plain that the Jewish leaders were behind the arrest, trial and crucifixion of Jesus. But what gets lost in translation is the fact that it was the Jewish leadership that were behind this act and not the rank and file. Why? Jesus was messing with their money, as did John the Baptist before him. The whole industry that was built up around the animal sacrifice and tithing system that was in place at the Temple provided a veritable river of money that flowed directly into the pockets of the Jewish hierarchy, the Scribes, the Pharisees, the Sadducees and the money changers. When Jesus went into the Temple and turned over the money changers tables, remember what he said? He said, \u201c . . . but you have made my Father\u2019s house into a den of thieves.\u201d Which, more correctly translated means, \u201c. . . but you have made my Father\u2019s house into a house of merchandise.\u201d The religious upper crust of the day would not take such interference with the making of their living and struck at the first opportunity. Thus did the Son of God die for getting between Jews and their money. But that was 2000 years ago. So what\u2019s the big deal? One of the more troublesome revelations that my Dad told me of was his personal observation of those who were fleeing to America from pre-WWII Nazi Germany. Although the conversation took place almost 60 years ago I still remember what he said about the Jews immigrating to America, just before WWII. He said, \u201cA ruder, more arrogant and selfish lot you have never encountered.\u201d Want to know why Jews are persecuted? Sadly, but all too often they bring it upon themselves. Furthermore, many of the big money people are Jewish, and whereas this should not be any reason for hatred, sadly it is. These days, all one needs to do to be hated is to be successful. You\u2019ll see glaring examples of such behavior flashed across your TV screens on a regular basis. Lastly we have it from the mouths of the Prophets as to why trouble follows the Jews. Read the Prophet Jeremiah, starting with chapter 35\u201343 to see first hand the rebellious nature of Israel at the time. This is not just a one time occurrence, but a deliberate pattern found all through the scriptures, from start to finish. Then read Deuteronomy 28 to see what is to be garnered from such behavior. I could go on and on, but I\u2019ll let it rest for now. ",

            "answer_text": "\u2026 Antisemitism \u2026 It was never the Jewish people. It was never the religion Judaism. Homo spaiens are like many species; territorial minded, family,clan, tribal mentalities. All of them compete against each other, staking out claims to protect themselves from each other. None of any groups can hope to live unto themselves, especially,if they do it on someone else\u2019s territory. Euro Jewry,like Euro Sinti & Roma never had their own territory anywhere in Europe, but wanted to live only among themselves. Entities, like the Catholic Church & temporal powers, all over Europe rejected & misused them. Temporal rulers & religious rulers don\u2019t tolerate foreign view points, sufficating competition, anywhere. Isolated groups of Jewry lived among themselves since Priest Ezra in 456BC, bringing the Judaic version of theism, decreed it to be, even from their cousin Semites in the Levant. Speak only Hebraic, divorce non Judean wives, practice endogamy & above all worship only one Canaanite Elohe sibling God Yahweh, under the tetragrammaton YHWH, which even Abram paid his tithe to, in 1800BC, worshipped the only existing Canaanite version of anthropomorphic theism, - which they adopted in 2315BC, from the Sumerians, who conceptualized it, eons earlier, - adapting Canaanite names of their Gods EL & 70 Elohim sibling Gods. Priest Ezra would begin the tradition of sequestration, as a Ghetto life style, held on to until today. Euro rulers would use this to their advantage accommodating them. Before 456BC, anywhere in the ME, Levant,North Africa, Judeans lived among other Semites. Judean immigrants would immigrate to Greece in 200BC, would voluntarily among themselves, as all others, who would call themselves Sephardi spreading into all of Europe with this life style. The survivors of the fall of the Kingdom of Israel in 722BC fleeing to Persia lived among the Persians, until today. The survivors of the fall of the Kingdom of Judea remaining in Babylon,lived among the Babylonians, until modern times. ",
