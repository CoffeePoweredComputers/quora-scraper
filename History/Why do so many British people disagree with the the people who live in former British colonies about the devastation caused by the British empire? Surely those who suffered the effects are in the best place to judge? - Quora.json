            "answer_text": "Firstly, from the British perspective, British people are, on the whole, less aware of the negative aspects of empire. We go through our entire schooling without confronting the most egregious injustices perpetrated in our name by our ancestors. Unless we specifically pursue colonial history or colonial literature at a higher level, we come away having a very benign view of British colonial history. Further more, when confronted by it head-on, our cognitive dissonance makes us a bit defensive, saying \u201cit wasn\u2019t me, I wasn\u2019t there, I can\u2019t be held responsible\u201d, which is correct of course but not the whole story. Contrast this to how we view our involvement in two world wars, somewhat equally distant in history, yet kept so fresh in our collective memories - the subject of so many TV documentaries and popular feature films I think that we would be better off if we came to terms with our own colonial history much like modern Germany and their Nazi past, by introducing our colonial history in an age-appropriate manner very early on and continuing throughout formal schooling. Secondly, from the former colonials\u2019 perspective, they legitimately have a grievance. And cultural memory goes deep. Events of a hundred years ago seem as galling, as insulting today as they did when they occurred. But that is an easy crutch on which a weakened former colony can rest. It is so much easier for a dysfunctional government to blame their woes on a century-old colonial master than on their own inadequacies. If you look at a whole host of former colonies - in the Indian subcontinent and in Africa - an entire generation of political leaders has grown up and come into power not knowing Empire at all and yet that memory is still kept fresh and the grievance kept alive. It\u2019s not entirely their fault, of course. At the time these countries gained independence, they had been drained of their resources, and systematic discrimination had left them with very few trained and experienced leaders. And they emerged into a world where the chips were stacked so much in favour of the incumbent powers, they faced a difficult job. Some succeeded and became economically successful free-market democracies while others soon collapsed under internecine violence and despotic rulers. Those that made it out of the shadow of colonialism no longer see themselves as victims and look forwards not backwards. Those who suffered a lack of leadership and are locked in religious and tribal conflict find it easier to blame the colonial other. ",

            "answer_text": "Because the people saying they have suffered devastation mostly suffer this because of what their countries done AFTER they got independence. Many of the British colonies in Africa, and in Asia, suffered civil wars, communism, famines etc, which all were not caused by the British Empire. Pakistan and India, for example, have had 4 or so wars since 1947, and although their original borders were the fault of the British, they could have resolved things by now and have not. Northern Cyprus and Southern Cyprus are divided, and part of the country is blocked off from both sides. This is the fault of Turkey, not the British Empire. Egypt\u2019s revolutions/coups and their issues with ISIS and Israel are not the fault of the British Empire either. The Israel-Palestine situation is also not the fault of the British Empire, as it has been 60 odd years and the two countries have still not sorted their issues out - that is down to them, not the UK. Most of those who remember the British Empire in their countries are dead now, and those that do remember them remember what is arguably the kindest era of the British Empire, the post-WW1 era (not saying it was truly nice or peaceful, but it was much better than the pre-20th century British Empire was). You say those who suffered the effects are the best place to judge it, but since it has been so long since the end of the Empire, maybe people should actually look to what their own country has done instead of blaming it on a long-dead Empire. (NOTE: I know the British Empire did cause some issues, the Indo-Pakistani border being one of the major ones, but people blame the UK and her former empire for much more than they should, and it is absolutely stupid.)
