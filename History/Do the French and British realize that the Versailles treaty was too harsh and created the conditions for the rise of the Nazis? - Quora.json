            "answer_text": "The terms were not too harsh, and the French and British had reason to implement these terms. First of all, it was the second time in forty years that the German army invaded France, and both times caused major damage to French infrastructure and killed thousands of French civilians and soldiers. Part of the reason why the treaty was created was to prevent the Germans from ever invading France again. Secondly, the treaty was created to force the Germans to pay reparations to the British and French. Germany didn\u2019t start the war, but they became the largest aggressor and invaded Belgium and France, opening up the Western front. Northern France and Belgium were devastated, entire towns were destroyed in the fighting. Three percent of the country\u2019s population was killed (1 327 000 people). 886 000 British and empire soldiers were killed, and Britain itself was bombed numerous times. The British, French, and German economies were in the tank, and all three owed massive war debts. Germany had to be held responsible for what they did and how much damage they caused. During the 20\u2019s, the American government released the Dawes plan, loaning Germany money to pay their war debts. This helped the Germans greatly, and soon after the German economy began to boom. Part of the plan was for the French troops to withdraw from the Ruhr region, then resulting in the total withdrawal of allied troops in the following years. The German economy began to heavily rely on that of the Americans as they began to stabilise. When the American economy collapsed in 1929, the German economy collapsed with it as well, leading back to where they were after the war. Germany once again was a mess, and the German citizens wanted a leader who would be authoritarian, or in their case fascist. Hitler and the national socialists who had been a fringe party since their creation, now began to gain popularity. Hitler was elected in 1933, and so began his reign of torture and tyranny. He blamed the Jews and Bolsheviks for the woes of Germans, he instilled a nationalist view in many Germans, forming hatred for the British and French. By 1933, there were no allied troops left in Germany, and the French and British were to concerned with the economic collapse to really even bother with Germany. Hitler began to raise an army, and by 1935 had an army that was over the limit of 100 000. He then raised an air force, and building submarines and ships, violating the treaty of Versailles again. Hitler had raise an army so quickly that a massive war would have been inevitable, there was nobody there to enforce the treaty anymore. ",

            "answer_text": "Not nearly harsh enough. Compare the terms Ludendorff forced on Lenin in 1917\u201318 when he forced the latter to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.The so-called overly \u201charsh treaty\u201d did not much impede Germany\u2019s ability to re-build a vast war machine-especially after 1935.And soon it took an enormous coalition,and another world war, to smash the new Germany. Blaming the Treaty of Versailles for the rise of Adolf Hitler is a cop out designed to get the Germans off the hook and I don\u2019t buy it it.Never forget that it was a plurality of the GERMAN electorate that gave Hitler and his gang a shot at power in 1932.And this,even though this man was peddling \u201cideas\u201d which were both criminal+insane.(And even most Germans realized it at the time.)

            "answer_text": "Yes I believe the British felt it was maybe going too far, but the French (and Belgians), who were far more personally effected by the war, wanted to be compensated fully for the cost of the Germans damages to their land. The French (and Belgians) also wanted a part of Germany as a buffer zone so in any new war there would be time for them to retaliate. The fact that this buffer zone included a good chunk of the Germans industrial zone was here nor there. The British went along with this outcome due to the above and yes it difficulties it caused the Germans probably did cause the rise of extreme forces within the country. But on the other hand I would have preferred WW2 to have happened in 1939 than say 1959, when things would have been a whole lot nuclear in nature. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually they thought it to soft. What it really was was both. It was not harsh enough to keep them down nor magnanimous enough to keep them from wanting revenge. In retrospect the only treaty that would have fulfilled both (even that is doubtful) would be to resurrect the old principalities of the Holy Roman Empire days. The locals could have switched gears and had something traditional to latch on to. It probably wouldn\u2019t have worked. The other alternative is simply to grab a few defensible positions and disputed territories in the settlement, and no nonsense about war guilt which should have been left to historians. ",

            "answer_text": "Rubbish, if you want harsh terms look at Brest Litovsk. The russians did not use that as their excuse to invade their neighbors. By 1939 the germany had remilitarized plus the payments on reparations were suspended and in any case Hitler had repudiated the debt, the rhineland and saarland along with the czech republic were all under german control. What the hell were they angry about by then ? Most of the treaty terms had been overturned, how the hell does that justify invading poland the ussr and murdering civilians ? ",
