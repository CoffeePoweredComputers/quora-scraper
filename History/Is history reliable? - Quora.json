            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A, Adam Haleem. >>How do we truly know that what happened in history is accurate? We never truly know. We just create a narrative and look for clues and proofs in support or opposition of it. Just like with solving some type of a crime, or considering a conflict resolved in the court. For example, Martin Luther King\u2019s death or Johm F. Kennedy\u2019s one. There are coroners reports about their deaths, vitnesses testimony, several investigations results, sometimes - confession of the suspect, later recalled. Etc.etc. And there is \u201clone gunman\u201d official narrative, set by government investigators. And some facts fit it, some facts - don\u2019t, some are just classified. When some documents become declassified narrative might adjust and might not. So history is more or less like that. Historian\u2019s job is to introduce new, previously unknown facts to the professional community and review the narrative considering the new information. This step-by step research hopefully allows us know at least something about what happened in history with controlled (but almost never absolute) level of accuracy. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is problematic. What do you mean by \u201chistory\u201d and what do you mean by \u201creliable\u201d? The study of history, like any academic discipline, is based on critical evaluation If known perameters. For broad questions like \u201cdid Julius Caesar exist? \u201d we have so much evidence from so many sources, that it is not reasonable to question this fact. However, if you want to know if you can trust Plutarch to be objective and accurate in his histories, you need to have some understanding of hermeneutics. History is not just one story. There is no single objective truth, especially when authors, ancient or modern, are offering their own evaluations. For example, take modern events. Even if we can agree on the facts of what is actually happening, we may not agree on the interpretation of those facts. Everybody has their own perspective on events and something which causes jubilation in one observer may induce panic in another. The further back in history we go, the harder it is to understand the complexity of these kinds of dynamics. History is not just facts and dates- much If that is fairly reliable for the most part, where things get difficult is in understanding the deeper story. When it comes to the interpretation of history, there is not, and cannot be a simple narrative with only one interpretation. Any attempt to impose such a single interpretation is a kind of violence against history itself. ",
