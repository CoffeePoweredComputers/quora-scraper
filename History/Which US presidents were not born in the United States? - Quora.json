            "answer_text": "Technically speaking, there are eight former U.S. Presidents who were not born in the United States. George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, John Q. Adams, Andrew Jackson, and William Henry Harrison were all born prior to 1776, and therefore were born in British colonies. Martin Van Buren, the 8th President, was the first to be born in the United States. Harrison succeeded him, but every President since John Tyler (the 10th) was born in the U.S. As for someone being born outside the country and becoming President in the future, that hasn\u2019t happened yet, but it probably will at some point. John McCain was actually born in the Panama Canal Zone when it was controlled by the United States. An official ruling was made in his case that he was eligible when he received the GOP nomination in 2000, but this was pretty much academic. Both McCain\u2019s father and grandfather were Admirals in the U.S. Navy. No one in their right mind would have ever interpreted the Constitution as prohibiting the child of a member of the U.S. Armed Forces serving overseas as ineligible for any public office. George Romney was born in Mexico, but both of his parents were U.S. citizens, and he was therefore a U.S. citizen at birth regardless of where he was born. One possibility is Tulsi Gabbard, the U.S. Senator from Hawaii who is an up-and-comer in the Democratic Party. Gabbard was born in American Samoa, but is a natural-born U.S. citizen through her mother, and has lived in Hawaii since she was two. ",

            "answer_text": "Because there were no \u201cnatural born citizens\u201d older than 12 or 13 years old at the time the Constitution was ratified, in order to be able to go ahead and elect presidents, the Framers included the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d in the Constitution (\u201c\u2026or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution\u2026\u201d), to exempt the first few from having to be natural born citizens. Eight of the first nine presidents had to be \u201cgrandfathered in\u201d, but after that, ALL presidents have had to be born on U.S. soil to parents who were themselves, citizens and then, the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d was no longer necessary. The only exceptions to \u201cbirth on U.S. soil to citizen parents\u201d were Chester A. Arthur, who was vice president to Pres. Garfield, who was assassinated, and Arthur was sworn in as president. There was controversy at the time, because Arthur\u2019s father, born in Ireland, had not yet become a naturalized U.S. citizen when Chester was born, and didn\u2019t until Chester was 14 years old. The other \u201cpresident\u201d who was born on U.S. soil but didn\u2019t have parents who were both citizens, was Barack Obama, whose Kenyan, British subject father was never a citizen or even a legal resident of the U.S., but both men HID their family records and it could not be proven that they were constitutionally ineligible. Arthur had burned his family records to hide the fact that his father wasn\u2019t a citizen at the time Chester was born. Birth on U.S. soil + citizen father + citizen mother = natural born citizen! \"Although those Americans who acquire their citizenship under statutes conferring citizenship on the foreign-born children of citizens are not popularly thought of as naturalized citizens, the use of the word \"naturalize\"in this way has a considerable constitutional history. Congress is empowered by the Constitution to \"establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,\" Art. I, \u00a7 8. Anyone acquiring citizenship solely under the exercise of this power is, constitutionally speaking, a naturalized citizen.\"-Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U.S. 815 (1971) Rogers v Bellei refers to people like George Romney, Cruz, McCain and yes, Tulsi Gabbard, who were born OUT of the U.S. to one or two citizen parents. They ARE \u201ccitizens\u201d, but they are \u201cnaturalized by congressional statute\u201d citizens, not natural born citizens and not constitutionally eligible for the presidency or vice presidency.

            "answer_text": "Too many people have no idea why the Constitution mandates that The President be born to parents (both) who are US Citizens on the day of that birth. Natural Born Citizenship was defined to the Founding Fathers within the text of the only existing Law Book that they had access to. Vattel\u2019s \u201cLaw of Nations.\u201d Within that book it said that someone born in a nation to citizen parents had no family ties to any Foreign Nation; a Natural Born Citizen. We had just evicted the British from our new Nation and John Jay, who later became the first Supreme Court Justice, wrote Article Two, part of which required the President to be natural born. But, of course, no one had yet been born in the USA. So, they wrote in a grandfather clause allowing existing citizens an exception. \u201cNo Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.\u201d Now that there are no more original citizens this clause requires that your parents be US citizens when you are born. You also must be 35 years old. The fourteen year resident requirement is no longer an issue because that mandate only assured another citizen of Britain could not arrive on the continent and run for President. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news to many, but just as a newborn inherits their Family Name from the Father, they also inherit the Father\u2019s nationality. When the Constitution was written a woman also inherited the nationality of her new husband, so in it\u2019s original intent the mother\u2019s nationality does not matter as regards holding Office as President.

That tells me you can be born in another country, like I was, but naturalized by your parents, who were citizens of the U.S. although in another country when they gave birth. The \u201cor\u201d tells me you only have to be a Citizen of the U.S., doesn\u2019t say you can\u2019t be President if your were born in another country and became a citizen through immigration. I could be wrong, but it seems that what the constitution outlines. I did hear from other people that you cannot be President if you were an immigrant from another country and became a U.S. Citizen, but the wording says otherwise to me. S A group of people claim Obama was not born in the U.S. therefore illegitimate based on his Hawaii birth certificate being proven a forgery by some 3rd party investigative source and based on other records, however, the evidence was not officially investigated by the U.S. government and Obama is officially assumed to be born in Hawaii. However, according to the wording of the constitution, it really didn\u2019t seem to matter either way, because he was a citizen. In addition, there were certainly Presidents that were not born in the U.S.; George Washington, because the U.S. didn\u2019t exist when he was born, along with the first few Presidents after him for the same reason.

With the exception of eight of the first nine U.S. presidents, all of whom were born in what would become states of the U.S. but who by definition couldn\u2019t have been born in a nation that had not yet been born, all presidents have come within the \u201cnatural-born\u201d citizenship requirement. The governing interpretation of that apparently focuses upon the citizenship-status of a candidate\u2019s parent or parents. Several major candidates for presidents were born to American citizen parents but outside one of the American states and, if they had won election, would have been eligible for inauguration. Barry Goldwater, the Republican nominee in 1964, was born in Arizona, but before it was elevated from the status of territory to that of a state. John McCain, nominated by the GOP in 2008, had American parents but he was born in the Panama Canal Zone (then under U.S. jurisdiction, but now a part of the nation of Panama). Ted Cruz, a major candidate for nomination in 2016, had America parents but was born in Canada. One thing for sure: the claim of \u201cBirthers\u201d notwithstanding: Hawaii was a state of the United States when Barack Obama was born there in 1961. ",

We have several examples of candidates who were born outside the US running. George Romney, father of Mitt Romney ran for President, but he was born in Mexico American parents. John McCain was born in Panama, to American parents but was born in an area that the US controlled anyway at the time. We also have Ted Cruz who was born in Canada and he caused a lot of stir because while his mother was indisputably American, his father is Cuban. Now let\u2019s get on to the birther allegations. Most people by now know of the Obama birther theories, that he was actually born in Kenya. His father we know was, but his mother was an American citizen. He was actually not in fact the first president to have such an allegation. It was claimed during his time that Chester Arthur was secretly born in Canada. That too has been officially debunked. ",

Although he was born in Vermont, conspiracists reason that he was actually born in Canada, but was given US Citizenship because he lived in a village right on the border.

And anyone that is born abroad of a US Citizen - IS A US CITIZEN! I don\u2019t think anyone would join the Military or US Government and have a child abroad, if this was not a fact! What about FBI, US Embassy Duty, CIA and other agencies that go abroad that are allowed to bring their family - I don\u2019t think people would enter those Jobs if their offspring would not be considered a US CITIZEN that was born abroad!!

Martin Van Buren, our 8th president, was the first President born an American Citizen. Several were born as dual citizens while their parents were visiting in foreign countries. Some of our best known presidents statyed out with dual or multiple citizenship. This is why all presidents have to renounce the citizenship of another country and with the election of Van Buren, has to be an American citizen who has never renounced their American citizenship. There was a great fear dual or multiple citizenships would either produce a \u201cManchurian candidate\u201d or a conflict of interest in trade, treaty, and military conflict. Justifiable concerns for any country with an elected leader. ",

So someone such Alexander Hamilton, who was born in West Indies, could have become President. But of course he never did and that exemption long ago became irrelevant. Had John McCain succeeded in his presidential bid there might well have been a test court case that would have established a definite interpretation of what the Constitution means by \u201cnatural born.\u201d Should Ted Cruz be elected at some point the matter will almost certainly arise then and will, equally certainly, I would think, go to the Supreme Court for a definitive ruling. But that has to await an actual case. ",

Up until then, U.S.A. were colonies declaring their independence from their mother country. All the other presidents were born in the colonies before the United States was officially recognized as a country. It is popular to believe that 1776 was the birth of the United States of America, when Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence; however, U.S.A. was not recognized as an independent, sovereign country until after the Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783) and the defeat of its mother country.
