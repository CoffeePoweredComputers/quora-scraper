            "answer_text": "I have always found it strange why other people do not like history. I have always loved history for as long as I can remember. I find the past endlessly fascinating. History is the story of where everything came from and how the world got to be the way it is now. You can pick up any object, name any field of study, think of any idea that exists in the world today and, no matter what it is, it has history. Everything that exists can be traced back through time eis tous aionas ton aionon\u2014\u201cunto the ages of ages.\u201d One thing that everyone has to remember about history is that history is the story of everything that has ever been. As such, it deals with incredibly diverse subject matters. No matter what you are interested in, it exists in history. Some people enjoy learning about wars and politics. Other people enjoy learning about the culture and everyday life of times gone by. Other people enjoy learning about the amusing and bizarre anecdotes and incidents from the past. Other people enjoy learning about the art, literature, science, and philosophy of past cultures. I personally find all of these things\u2014and so many other things\u2014endlessly fascinating. I think the main reason why so many people hate history has nothing to do with history itself and far more to do with how history is taught. If the person teaching you about history is not passionate or excited by what they are teaching and they fail to present it in an interesting way, then it is obviously it will not be as appealing as it would have been if that person had been a better teacher. Thus, many people who might have learned to love history end up hating it because of how it was taught. Many people also unfortunately seem to believe that history is \u201cuseless,\u201d \u201cirrelevant,\u201d and that it has \u201cno practical application\u201d in the modern era. I think this view is very wrong. History possess immense applicability to the present because it still affects us. As William Faulkner wrote in his book Requiem for a Nun, \u201cThe past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past.\u201d We can never understand the present if we do not understand the past. We can also learn from the past and use it to better understand our current circumstances by comparing the circumstances we are in now with those circumstances people have been in before. Thus, the past can not only teach us to better understand the present, but also help us to work out solutions for current problems. If we fail to learn the lessons of history, then we only end up repeating the same mistakes. For further defense of the value of teaching history, see this article on \u201cWhy Ancient History Matters,\u201d which I wrote as a response to the College Board\u2019s announcement last summer that they were dropping ancient and medieval history from their AP World History course.  ABOVE: The Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis is the most widely recognized symbol of ancient Athens, an ancient state which I have often thought reminds me of the present-day United States, not only in its glories and successes, but also in its problems, dysfunctionalities, and faults.

History is the rich drama of the human experience. People watch televisions and films to be entertained - history's real. It happened. How did we get here today? How did we not manage to blow ourselves or the planet up - so far - and how did we become billions of people speaking thousands of different languages with myriad cultural differences between us?That's history and there's nothing boring about it. It's rich with intrigue, with remarkable feats of creative human endeavor and tragically remarkable cruelty. It's the best story of all the stories told and it happened and it led to you - where you're sitting at this moment now connected instantaneously to everyone else of the billions of people on the planet who also have this remarkable device upon which you're reading and writing. What is the best invention wrought by human hands? What is the most effective form of government? Has any people found their way to live free of war? Is war inevitable? Is it true that human conflict at its foundation is people fighting over a few essential resources?   It's so much better than the stuff one watches on television - if it's presented as it is - a journey of discovery into the realm wrought by humanity on this big blue marble in the sky. But rather than tell that story, it's parceled out in details - and most often they're presented as if separate from each other. The humanity is taken out of history - each step is dull and dry as if there were no people behind that step making decisions to invade each other's country, to come up with a writing system, to marry off their children to each other, to intrigue against each other and sometimes to raise each other up to new and remarkable heights. If history is viewed - and taught - as a string of events with dates - and not as the rich drama that it is - then it becomes boring. And if it's taught with the eye on - 'how can I test that' - 'how can I put that on a test' - if I can't put that on a test than I shouldn't be covering it in class - they have to memorize the dates and I have to give them information that I can test them on - that boils down to tiny concrete multiple choice questions - that sucks all the life out of history and the urge to listen and learn out of the kids.

After learning the \"tricks of the trade\" from me, today they are second year university undergraduates. I will tell you why students hate History, and I must say, with all due respect, the History teacher has partly to be blamed. students don't see the significance of the subject, in relation to all the other subjects that make up their academic curriculum;students don't realise the significant contribution of the subject to their future employability and career tracking;students are not taught the proper study skills in navigating History lessons with ease, expediency and ace;I have taught my two foster sons on how to use a \"Divide and Conquer Strategy\", in conjunction with proven graphic organisers and visual tools, when it comes to reading and studying  history. For me, history is just a few important things: the chronology of important events, places, era, time, moods, ambiance;the causes and consequences (or impacts) of the foregoing events;the person(s) contributing to the foregoing events;the vital lessons learned;To help me navigate the textual terrain of History and flesh out the essential facts, I would use: a Timeline or an extended version known as Transitive Order Diagram to flesh out the \"important events, dates, places and persons\";an Idea Map, as a supplementary reading strategy, to identify and lay out the attributes and motivations of the \"important persons\";for the \"causes and consequences\" in connection with the \"important events\", I would use a Fish Bone Diagram to isolate the causes and consequences;Here's an example of a Transitive Order Diagram:  By the way, the purpose of studying History is to draw valuable lessons from the past so that we can make informed decisions about our future, without having to repeat mistakes of the past.

That is until I met one of the best teachers I\u2019ve ever had. Let\u2019s call him Mr. H. Mr. H was a stern, no nonsense man in every sense of the phrase. Even the most unruly students somehow found themselves being quiet and tolerable in his classes. He has his own fool proof method of study, which he called \u201cThe H method\u201d. During classes he would pass out a short booklet of notes with phrases missing. The notes were written like a book. Not one of the average history books, but more so like a fantasy novel. During lectures we would listen to him recount the stories and fill in the blanks of our notes, which not only kept us engaged but made the note-taking process a lot easier on us by highlighting the more important information. Not only this but he was seriously into his job. I mean you could see the excitement on this man\u2019s face with every lecture he gave. He would often engage his students in the discussion by asking questions. \u201cWhat do you think happened? What happened last time?\u201d If you messed up he\u2019d feign a heart attack. It was a riot. In order to make sure we were retaining certain events we would often have group assignments where we were required to \u201cact\u201d out the events in a more modern setting. It was one of the first history classes that not only did I enjoy showing up for the lessons but I actually passed the class with flying colors. Everyone loved him. Some students even made a Facebook page like shrine for him. Needless to say he captivated the hearts of many students and made me more interested in history lessons as a whole. I never quite met another teacher like him in that subject. ",

Students who are involved in discussion about the past and how it helped to shape the present will not likely find it boring. Students who are engaged in evaluating cause and effect; exploring human reactions to events; and examining how culture, geography, and regional interactions affect society will not find it boring. History is a series of decisions. Some lead to positive outcomes, while others do not. I know that I am oversimplifying, but at its root, this is true. Sociology, psychology, economics, philosophy, and government are all social sciences, and they are all important factors in discussing history and its relevance to contemporary society. Students benefit from making these connections, and when they are given the opportunity to be part of the discussion in a real and meaningful way, they are much more likely to see that history is anything but boring.

            "answer_text": "Greetings, Students are bored to tears when History curriculum is poorly presented by teachers who lack sufficient academic preparation to enjoy subject matter mastery. Until credentialing and subject area endorsement standards were upgraded in many states, teachers who were hired essentially for their ability to coach a sport, but were had to fill instructional assignments were routinely given classes like History, Driver\u2019s Education, or remedial anything. Coaches who were stuck with teaching History legendarily relied on an out-of-date textbook, worksheets, videos, and objective tests as instructional materials. Students often were directed to work silently while Coach worked on prep-game duties. On game days, Coach was either absent at an away event with the team, or poring over the playbook while students watched a movie. Even if students benefit from engaging teachers, compelling instructional materials, and fascinating projects, they will still hate History if the subject is not presented as relevant. Keeping History relevant is probably the teacher\u2019s greatest challenge. Students deserve more justification for studying a particular subject than tediously hearing, \u201cBecause it\u2019s required.\u201d Sincerely, AJG. ",

Similarly, mostly everyone disregards the past as irrelevant to the present. Students feel very disconnected from the people of the past, they laugh at their clothes and hairstyles, they can't understand the language of old books (any book published before the XX century or just after the turn of the century will be a really hard read for most students).

            "answer_text": "Americans treat pretty much all of the liberal arts as optional. STEM is the big one for standardized testing, so that\u2019s the one that gets the attention. As such, most American schools don\u2019t bother actually hiring teachers with decent history backgrounds. They just hand the job off to the football coach. This happened even at my exclusive, private, top-in-the-city high school. I got a better education on history from my Latin and Greek teachers! If you don\u2019t give a crap about it as a culture, it\u2019s a relatively easy subject to hand off to a teacher who doesn\u2019t know much about it. That may be true for other liberal arts like English, but it\u2019s especially so for History. English teachers have to actually teach reading comprehension and analysis. For History, you just need a state curriculum and to grade the papers. ",

As a foreign language teacher, I approached the history of the language-related countries as a sweeping movement of peoples and ideas, including geography, climate and economy. My students often asked why they never understood this from history class. History is relevant, and the students see this when presented this way. Our current migrations are a case in point. We can\u2019t understand the \u201cwhy\u2019s\u201d of what\u2019s happening now unless we understand how we got here. That\u2019s what needs to be taught, and what might be remembered. ",

But what happens in reality is due to such less amount of teaching hour's and syllabus completion, they end up teaching in a very wrong way. Teacher's tell students to mug up the important dates of important historic events instead of knowing actually why made that day so historic. The syllabus designed is a compressed version of so many wars, assassinations, deaths, decisions. History needs to be told like a story; every move, every event, every war. If mugging up, who killed who is the case then students will definitely lose interest and find it boring as that killing will never affect their life. ",
