            "answer_text": "Biden doesn\u2019t have a very strong history as a friend of the Black community. He\u2019s so proud of his ability to \u2018work with\u2019 Republicans, but that mostly consists of him helping Republicans achieve their agendas. He\u2019s been a real good friend to some notoriously racist Republicans. That\u2019s why (or at least part of why) Obama chose him as VP \u2014 He needed someone who could talk to, and comfort, the racist \u2018Dixicrats\u2019. If you know your American history well, Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. Republicans ruled the North and were generally anti-slavery. Democrats ruled the south and started a war with the north to \u2018defend\u2019 slavery. After they lost, they continued to be the party of slavery, racism and \u2018Jim Crow\u2019 laws. The Republicans were the party of the north and more pro human rights and anti-slavery. This continued until about the \u201960s when Kennedy and, later, Johnston went whole hog on human rights and anti-racism. .. then the electoral map generally flipped. Nowadays, Lincoln would turn over in his grave to know that the party that he brought into power is now the party of racism and hatred. But there are still DixiCrat pockets .. People who are still Democrat and staunchly, or just slightly, racist. Obama chose Biden as someone who could whisper sweet nothings into the ears of those still-racist Democrats. So, Joe Biden has his reputation as the right hand man of America\u2019s first Black president .. in part because he is a bit of a racist. Another reason why Obama probably isn\u2019t that eager to support Biden is that he\u2019s not that good of a campaigner. In three attempts at the Democratic nomination for president, South Carolina was the first time he came in better than third in a presidential primary. That\u2019s not the kind of history that your average president is gonna want to stake his legacy on. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s pretty rare for Presidents to inject themselves early in the primary process. The custom is for past and sitting presidents to wait for the primary process to play out before formally endorsing the presumptive nominee. In the (recent) past\u2026 2016: Obama endorsed Clinton on June 9[1] , after the primaries had concluded and Clinton had secured a majority / Neither Bush endorsed Trump[2] , having previously backed \u201cJeb!\u201d;2012: H.W. Bush endorsed Romney March 29[3] , after Romney had taken a clear lead, and W. Bush on May 15[4] going into the Texas primary where Romney was all but certain to clinch the nomination[5] ;2008: W. Bush endorsed McCain on March 5[6], the day after he had secured the nomination / Clinton didn\u2019t endorse Obama until the DNC[7] ; and,2004: Clinton consciously[8] did not endorse Kerry until the DNC[9] .2000 was, perhaps, the last election in which former presidents endorsed early. Clinton endorsed Gore in 1998[10] , and Bush was, of course, backed by his father.
