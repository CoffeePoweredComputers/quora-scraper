            "answer_text": "This is the map of the modern-day People\u2019s Republic of China:  There are three Chinese dynasties which I can think of where they had more territory than modern China controlled. The Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty:  The dotted lines represent modern China\u2019s territorial borders. As you can see from this map, the Yuan Dynasty also controlled Mongolia, North Korea, Tanu Tuva, and also parts of Myanmar (Burma). The Manchu-led Qing Dynasty:  The faint red dotted lines represent the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s borders. As you can see, Qing China also controlled Mongolia, Tanu Tuva, the island of Taiwan (Republic of China), parts of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Outer Manchuria, which is now part of the Russian Federation. Ming Dynasty ruled by Han Chinese  Again, the dotted line represents modern-day China\u2019s border. The Ming Dynasty also controlled parts of Outer Manchuria, which isn\u2019t part of the modern day China. Finally, this is not an official dynasty, but rather a kingdom. However, I want to put this on here just for fun. Kingdom of Tungning  They were basically the remanents of the Ming Dynasty who escaped to Taiwan island and established the Kingdom of Tungning. They controlled the island of Taiwan, which the People\u2019s Republic of China doesn\u2019t officially control because it is under the administration of the Republic of China. Edit: Thank you Tran Minh Ngoc (\u9673\u660e\u7389) for pointing this out in the comments section. I forgot to mention the Tang Dynasty and the Han Dynasty who also controlled territories which are not part of modern China. Tang Dynasty  The Tang Dynasty controlled parts of modern-day Kazakhstan and North Vietnam. Han Dynasty  The Han Dynasty controlled parts of North Vietnam. ",
