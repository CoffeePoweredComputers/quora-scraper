            "answer_text": "Obviously a whole book could be written on that subject but to oversimplify a bit \u2026 The history of Christianity is often white washed. Christianity broke into various factions in its early history. When emperor Constantine got involved, the divisions actually deepened despite his intention to unify Christianity. There emerged a stark division between the official Roman Church and other major sects like the Copts and the Syriacs. As the Empire became officially Christian, the unrecognized sects were persecuted off and on. Remember that Christianity had a longer history in the East than in the West. In the west, the division was largely just between Rome and Christianity and Germanic Christianity. But because of their wish to become more civilized, more Roman, the Germanic rulers eventually forced all their subjects to adopt Roman Christianity. In the East, the unrecognized sects were much more deeply rooted. When Islam came along, there were many aspects of the new faith to Coptic traditions and others. And ultimately the Muslim rulers were more tolerant of these sects then the Romans were. So many of the Roman subjects in Egypt and Syria readily embraced their new Muslim rulers because of their hatred of the Eastern Romans in Constantinople. It didn't take long before they started to call themselves Muslims, at first in name only, but gradually embracing more and more of the faith. In Western Europe, by contrast, the kingdoms were largely enamored with trying to imitate Constantinople, though always in competition with it. By the late Middle Ages, when Constantinople was in decline, the competition between the Muslim and Christian world was firmly established and neither side was going to back down. ",

            "answer_text": "Because the armies of Islam, coming from Arabia, invaded Egypt, Palestine and Syria from 640\u2013645. Islam conquered by the sword, and then set up governments and social systems in which other religions were disadvantaged. The pressure was on to convert to Islam. Three hundred Catholic dioceses in North Africa were wiped out as Islamic jihad reached the Straits of Gibraltar in 712 and invaded Spain, Portugal and then France. In Islamic-controlled regions, the penalty for conversion to Christianity was death. So there was never a level playing field between the two religions. People remained Islamic out of fear, and not wanting to be cut off by their families. ",
