            "answer_text": "Stalin was notorious for dealing with his enemies with iron hand. His mistrust of even his own friends led him to eradicate them. In his infamous Purges he killed hundred and thousands of people including his once close aides. Similarly the way he rose in party ranks also involved nefarious tactics. e.g the way Trotsky was sidelined shows how he conspired against his rivals. Even Lenin mistrusted Stalin for his Machiavellian ways. Moreover the Soviet policy of collectivisation and industrialisation under Stalin was enforced by the ruthless State machinery that led to immense suffering and misery for the working class. Stalin has also been accused for exterminating ethnic minorities and deportations to cultivate the Siberian lands. ",

            "answer_text": "Joseph Stalin was never convicted of any kind of non-political crime. He was involved with at least one bank robbery (the 1907 Tbilisi bank robbery) but in a secondary/behind the scenes role. We are not even sure that he witnessed the action (about 40 people were murdered that day). That robbery was mostly a bust, by the way. The stolen money was primarily in 500-rouble banknotes with numbers known to the police. They were practically unspendable, even abroad. In the end, Lenin had to burn them. While Joseph was described as an active kid in his childhood, he was not a physically active adult. His favorite activity was a Russian equivalent of bowling. Really, he was very nerdy. ",
