            "answer_text": "That is an excellent question. What we call America be was first inhabited at least 38,000 years ago by Polynesian people on our west coast according to recent archaeological discoveries. Even back then, people had ceremonial burials where their dead we're buried. Sure, a wave of Asians crossed the Bering Strait from Russia to Alaska after the last Ice Age 10,700 years ago but the Polynesian people had inhabited America first - 28,000 years before they arrived. So, how did Columbus \u201cDiscover\u201d America? There are actually two answers that indicate he didn't: #1. It had already been discovered by primitive people. What are \u201cprimitive people\u201d? People who can't write essentially. Europeans we're well more civilized and technology advanced. When they discovered (made a written record) of the discovery, this allowed them to write the history of the discovery basically and they then wrote our history books and made all of us go to school and be taught to understand that Columbus discovered America. This brings us to Part 2: Christibol Columbus (was his real name) who was given credit for discovering \u201cAmerica\u201d, listen to this: didn't discover \u201cAmerica\u201d\u2026he never even set foot on her. He first arrived in a small Bahama Island and went further west and landed on Haiti where the native Tiano Indians refused to carry his supplies and the women refused to \u201cservice\u201d his men with sex. Eventually all of the Indians fled to the mountains where Christopher Columbus's men annihilated them until the native population disappeared. Actually, Ponce de Leon was the first European to \u201cdiscover\u201d America in 1513 (I think?). So you may ask, why isn't America called \u201cColumbus\u201d? The reason that it's called \u201cAmerica\u201d is because of the man who was the first to \u201cmap\u201d it: Amerigo Vespucci in 1497. Although the Catholic Pope in the Holy Roman Empire had granted to Spain all the land North to Spain and all that South to Portugal, when Spain discovered a tremendous amount of gold and silver, the other European countries tried to establish squatter's rights by establishing forts or settlements or colonies on Spain's land. To make a long story short, Spain attempted to establish enough colonies to defend its territories however, this resulted in Spain being drained of its own people which left very few people to defend her and fight with Napoleon's army at Waterloo when England took control of Europe and most of the World (what they didn't acquire in the Treaty of 1763). To answer your question: Columbus discovered America because the victor writes the History of the day. Lol. ",

            "answer_text": "The phrase \u201cdiscover\" has a purely Eurocentric spin to it. And it's correct to point out that North and South America had been populated for many millennia and had produced cultures worthy of study. But their existence was unknown to civilizations in Europe and Asia. Columbus didn't set out to \u201cdiscover\u201d the New World. Like explorers before and after him, he was looking for a shortcut to the vast trading riches of Asia. Others had been slowly exploring along the coasts of Africa, along and laborious process. Columbus, using actually flawed math, had inaccurately underestimated the size of the planet and believed he could sail West from Europe to the riches of Asia. If the American continents hadn't been there, Columbus and his ships would have disappeared from history as just another crackpot! The saying is that it's the winners that write the history books. So if you want to imagine an alternative history, where the Iroquois Confederation annihilated those invading European palefaces, if Montezuma had decisively kicked Cortez's butt, if Pizarro had been slaughtered by the Incas, then the saga of \u201cAmerican history\u201d might have been documented with more respect for the indigenous peoples already there.
