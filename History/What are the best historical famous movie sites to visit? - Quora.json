            "answer_text": "I\u2019m taking this from the perspective of places which would be enjoyable places to have a holiday in, as well as being the locations of Iconic movies. I\u2019m also going to avoid the obvious ones, California, New York, London, Paris and Rome which have had thousands of films set in them. Petra, Jordan. Famous from Indiana Jones and the Holy Grail, it combines the beauty of the desert with fascinating ruins of the Nabataean trading civilization which spread far beyond the single iconic tomb featured in the movie. Jordan itself has plenty to offer in terms of history, culture and natural beauty.  Volcanoes National Park Rwanda - Gorillas in the Mist. The joy that people feel when they visit the Mountain Gorillas of Rwanda and Uganda is tremendous. I have seen so many photo\u2019s of people and they all have the same daft grin on their face. Both Rwanda and Uganda are also home to beautiful mountain landscapes and if you want to go full naturalist can also be enjoyed with a safari in the Masai Mara of Kenya. (RIP Dian Fossey).  Forza d'agro, Sicily The Godfather II An iconic movie set on an island with lots to offer. Really you can have any type of holiday you can think of on Sicily from lazy seaside, to art and history, to climbing volcanoes and lets not forget the food! Most of the scenes from the movie are around Messina in the North East of the Island.  Himeji Castle - Ran - There can be few film buffs who don\u2019t want to visit Japan and see some of the locations filmed in Akira Kurosawa iconic samurai movies as well as enjoying the culture, real Japanese food, hot springs and karaoke.  Skeilig Micheal, Ireland - The Last Jedi - Totally biased but the tricky to get to, weather dependent, spiky rocks and 6th century monastery are the most beautiful place in Ireland. Go in May/June when the Puffins are everywhere and necessitated the invention of the Porgs to cover them.  ",
