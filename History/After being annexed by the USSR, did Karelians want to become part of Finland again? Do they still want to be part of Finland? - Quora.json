            "answer_text": "Parts of Finnish Karelia were annexed by the USSR - the Karelian people were not. It happened twice, the evacuation of over 400 000 Karelians. First time after the Winter War in940 when Finland had to cede areas to the USSR and the second time in 1944 when it all happened again. During the Continuation War, when Finland seized the lost areas again, about 260 000 Karelians returned to their homes. When Finland lost those areas again, they were evacuated again. Finland ceded empty lands, there were 19 people who stayed in those areas that were ceded. So, the answer to the question is that the people of those areas, mostly Karelians wanted to remain Finnish. They were never under the Soviet rule and there never the such a situation the question assumes. After the war, the evacuated people missed their homes and there has been decade long missing, song making and later tourism to the ceded home districts to see the old homes. Never have I heard that those people or their descendants wanted to move back to the USSR or Russia though.  The areas ceded 1940 after the Winter war.

            "answer_text": "We need to first specify which Karelia as there are several, at least to the Finns and the various Karelians themselves. From south to north (and west to east within groups) there are 1) South Karelia and the Karelian Isthmus, which lies between the Gulf of Finland (part of the Baltic Sea) and Lake Ladoga; 2) North Karelia, Ladoga Karelia and Olenets Karelia; and 3) White Karelia, which borders on the White Sea. When you say \u201cannexed by the USSR\u201d I assume you\u2019re referring to 1939, which is when annexation took place. In 1939 and again 1944, the Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia were occupied by the USSR; the former was an annexation and latter a reocupation. Note that Olonets and White Karelia were already part of the USSR by the Treaty of Tartu, although it\u2019s possible that some of Olonets Karelia was part of Finland from 1922 to 1939 as I don\u2019t recall the exact boundary line. Similarly, South and North Karelia were and remained and still are part of Finland. The 1939 peace stipulated that all of the inhabitants were to evacuate with their personal belongings within 10 days. Property was to be left behind for resettled Russians and possibly other nationalities from the USSR. The overwhelming majority of the population did in fact evacuate (like 99.99% or more). But that still leaves Olonets and White Karelia. Olonets Karelia, particularly it\u2019s southern area which borders on Lake Ladoga, was settled after Finnish independence by \u201cRed Finns\u201d who lost the civil war that was briefly fought in Finland. After reclaiming the Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia in 1941, Finland avoided any movement against Leningrad which after all was full of Russians rather than Finns. Instead Finland occupied most or all of Olonets Karelia. There was consideration of occupying White Karelia but the Murmansk railway would have been cut by such a move and thus the Red Army held White Karelia tenaciously. As noted above, in 1944 Finland again surrendered the Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia and those who had resettled in their former homes were uniformly re-evacuated. As to Olonets Karelia, I do not know whether any of the native inhabitants also fled to Finland. If so they might well have been required to be repatriated to the USSR by the Allied Control Commission which in Finland\u2019s case was dominated by the Soviets. If so then the lucky ones probably fled to Sweden. As to the \u201cRed Finns\u201d (from all over Finland) who settled in Olonets Karelia, I also don\u2019t know whether after 20 years of Lenin and Stalin they tried to flee to Finland in any sort of numbers. If they did they would probably not have been very welcome. Hope that helps. ",
