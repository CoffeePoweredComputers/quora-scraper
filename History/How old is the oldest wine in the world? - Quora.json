            "answer_text": "Original Question: How old is the oldest wine in the world? As has already been mentioned, the oldest known wine is the Speyer Wine bottle, found in the grave of a Roman nobleman in Germany, and dating back to the 4th century. But moving on to more modern times, the oldest drinkable wine I\u2019m aware of is contained in a barrel dated 1472 which is stored in a wine cellar under the Strasbourg city hospital. The wine inside is still drinkable and records show it\u2019s only been tasted three times. Once in 1576 to celebrate the alliance between Strasbourg and Zurich; a second time in 1716 after the hospital burned down; and finally in 1944 when Strasbourg was liberated during World War II. Unfortunately the barrel started leaking, and the remaining content was transferred to a new barrel in 2014.  Several bottles of Tokaji, dated between 1650 \u2013 1690, from the Royal cellar of Augustus II in Dresden are still in existence, although I don\u2019t believe any have been tasted.  There is a bottle of R\u00fcdesheimer Apostelwein dated 1727 in existence, owned by the Graycliff Hotel in Nassau in the Bahamas, which is supposed to be still drinkable because of its high sugar content.  There are, or rather, there were, a couple of rare bottles of 1787 French Premier Cru wines still in existence, a Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild and a Ch\u00e2teau Margaux, both in private collections. The Lafite Rothschild is believed to have been one owned by Thomas Jefferson, a known wine connoisseur:  The Margaux, below, was unfortunately dropped and smashed during a party in 1989, ironically to celebrate the fact that it had been valued as the most expensive wine ever to be auctioned, valued at $1/2 million. It was insured\u2026!  Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "The oldest drinkable wines on record today are wines from Madeira, a small island off the coast of Portugal. These are fortified wines. These wines were commonly imported into the United States by our Founding Fathers due to the fact that they could be transported in cask on a ship with lots of sun and current. Neither the heat from the sun, nor the vibration of a rocking ship will affect the wine, making it the working man\u2019s swill of choice in the 1600\u2019s and 1700\u2019s. Today you can open up a bottle of Madeira from the 1700\u2019s and it will still be drinkable, perhaps even lovely. I consider these wines to be absolute gems, even though you can\u2019t drink too much without the guarantee of a horrible hangover. Bear in mind that while people find ancient wines on the floor of the seas and oceans, wine production changed dramatically after about the mid 1700\u2019s. Bordeaux wines were produced in more of a claret/rose style previous to that time period. It is considered to be around the mid 1700\u2019s that wine making shifted to a darker more tannic style wine. If you can find a legitimate sauternes from the early or late 1800\u2019s, and it it was stored properly, meaning it never left France and it was always sitting in a cool, dark cellar, then it could be good, but you\u2019re still rolling some expensive dice. One of my clients has a bottle of 1865 Lafite that was \u201crebouche au chateaux\u201d in 1980\u2019s, meaning it was evaluated and topped off by the winery, but I am almost certain the wine was topped off with more current vintage wine. The nazi\u2019s pretty much looted Bordeaux during the war and much of the wines in the winery\u2019s libraries disappeared during that time. A few wineries hid their wines inside false walls and forgot about them. Those wines I am told are still alive, but time isn\u2019t a friend of wine, especially when you are talking about 75+ years\u2026 ",
