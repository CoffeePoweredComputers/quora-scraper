            "answer_text": "Question: Were there actually hired \"fast guns or gunslingers\" in the old West? They didn\u2019t care how fast you could draw a gun. They DID care that you were willing and able to use one. Various groups and entities hired men who were enforcers and killers for situations which couldn\u2019t be handled by the local sheriff or by the men who they hired to supervise their properties. Those employers included railroads, mining companies, timber companies, large ranches, etc. Each one hired thousands of men for work and all of them employed at least one killer in case things got too far out of hand. Until the turn of the century, there wasn\u2019t much for law enforcement in many areas of the West. If a business was being robbed, or cattle or horses were being \u201crustled\u201d, then property owners and businessmen were \u201cfree\u201d to handle the matter in any manner they saw fit, and that included sending dangerous men in to \u201csolve\u201d the problem. The men could be hired quickly, they would be willing to do almost anything, and then they could be run off (or arrested) when their services were no longer required. The Pinkerton Agency hired a number of people of that ilk. They needed shooters, strike breakers, and basically thugs to enforce security, protect shipments, and prevent dangerous parties from harming their client\u2019s businesses. Since the men who hired the agency would normally keep their hands clean (many of them lived in large cities in the East and never traveled West) they could hire \u201cPinkertons\u201d who were ready and able to kill if that was what was required. The \u201cgunslinger: nonsense comes from dime novels and later from Hollywood writers whose primary experience with the American West was reading and remembering those novels. Drawing your gun quickly was useless if you couldn\u2019t hit anything. And it was even more useless if you were unwilling to use it to kill another human being. They wanted killers, not showboats.

People hired people, some psychopaths, who had no qualms about killing other people, Tom Horn for example. Those guys are still hired today. Once upon a time a little Lake Michigan cargo boat ran aground just to the north of the Mouth of the Chicago River. The Captain, fellow named \u201cStreeter\" stayed on board and over the weeks, months sand acreted around the boat\u2026.and Streeter pitched tents, set up a brothel, casino, and other disreputable stuff, robberies, muggings etc\u2026. just off shore from the squankiest lakeshore neighborhood in Chicago. Cap Streeter said it was his town, his laws. Contretemps! . Contretemps! Locals hired an Arizona gunfighter to shoot him. Streeter's wife killed him with an Axe. After many police raids, arrests trials etc\u2026... Streeterville is now one of the most upscale areas in the nation. ",
