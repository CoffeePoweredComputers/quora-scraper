            "answer_text": "WARNING: Graphic images included FRANCE France has a history with its Muslim residents In the words of Robert Fisk, Middle East correspondent for The Independent,  \u201cthe desperate and permanent crisis in Algerian-French relations\u201d is  \u201clike the refusal of a divorced couple to accept an agreed narrative of  their sorrow.\u201d Though the Algerian War took place in the middle of the  20th century, its foundation was laid by the 19th  century French invasion of Algeria, which was followed by efforts to  convert the Muslim population to Christianity. French rule fomented a  growing resentment among Algerians that in the 1950s would escalate to  revolt. Though exact death tolls don\u2019t exist, there are estimates that  hundreds of thousands to more than a million Algerian Muslims died in  the war, with tens of thousands of French military and civilians  perishing in the conflict. The peace that followed the ceasefire in 1962  was, as Fisk puts it, \u201ca cold peace in which Algeria\u2019s residual anger,  in France as well as in the homeland, settled into long-standing  resentment.\u201d Many of the hundreds of thousands of people of Algerian  descent living in France today are poor and feel the specter of discrimination in government policies like the 2010 ban on face coverings. In March 1962, LIFE photographer Paul Schutzer was on the scene in  Algiers as the Algerian War came to an end with a tenuous ceasefire and a  path to Algerian self-determination. Part of that city witnessed  jubilant celebration\u2014a truce had finally been reached between French  President Charles de Gaulle and the Muslim-led National Liberation  Front. But in other corners of town, a gruesome massacre was underway,  as a group of French army officers called the Organisation de l\u2019arm\u00e9e  secr\u00e8te (O.A.S.) in favor of French rule in Algeria killed innocent  Muslims in a last-ditch effort\u2014a mutiny of sorts\u2014to thwart independence. The History of French-Muslim Violence Began in the Streets of Algeria France\u2019s unresolved Algerian war sheds light on the Paris attack   There was torture and murder during the Algerian war of independence S\u00e9tif and Guelma massacre The photographs of the dead or tortured Algerians circulate on the internet [google image search] WARNING: Graphic images included french massacre of algerians  The  Muslims in France are largely descendents of those occupied by the  French. The French continue to demonise them and they have a largely  second class status in the country. They are, for example, still  considered as foreigners into their second and third generation in  France. French-Algerians are still second-class citizens | Nabila Ramdani There are wardrobe wars in France between the Muslims and the state France arrests Muslim women as full-face veil ban begins  French Muslim girl banned from school over long skirt, sparking outcry Paris riots sparked by police identity check on veiled Muslim woman Cornered \u2013 Princess Hijab, Paris's elusive graffiti artist  The  French laws which have banned the hijab, have led to the establishment  of Muslim only schools ; veiled women  had to stop working, leading to  the further social alienation of the Muslim community Muslim Lyc\u00e9e Opens in Secular France, Raising Eyebrows Headscarf ban turns France\u2019s Muslim women towards homeworking GERMANY  Germany does not share that same history with any of its  Muslim residents. On the other hand they have a history of taking in  Muslims who are refugees from other wars or colonial outposts. They also  have a largely immigrant Muslim population ie people who migrated  because Germany offered them a better life. They also have a largely  educated and prosperous Muslim community similar to the US.  Germany Integrating Islamic Lessons Into Public Schools Educating Imams for Germany Germany embraces young Muslims through education  Merkel joins Muslim rally for tolerance Which is why you are more likely to find disaffected Muslims in France and not Germany.

            "answer_text": "As already stated, Germany and France have  a very different history with their muslim immigrants.In Germany, in the 60s and 70s about 13 mio. so-called \"guest-workers\" (Gastarbeiter) were invited to have a job in the then booming manufacturing industries, in coal mining and steel production. Those workers came from all over southern Europe - and Turkey. They were not expected to stay (Germany was never a real immigration country), but at least 3 mil. did.So all those coming to Germany started in a job here, thus being integrated at least with their colleagues (which led to them speaking German quite well, but their spouses usually not). There existed no integration endeavors by the state administration at that time, that changed just in the last 10 yrs.Now the second and third generation is living in Germany, and situation is not that well anymore. Unemployment is about double the rate as for Germans with no migration background - but that's still about 16%. And there is an ungoing discussion on the reasons for that, especially for youngsters with Turkish (=muslim) background.But before the Syrian war, radical muslims were a minor issue in Germany, the Turkish community is rather restrained in living their religious live. Most  mosques are situated in usual house, without noticeable minaret-tower. Turkish women just wear headscarves, the younger ones walk often without one.In the last years, there is a growing influence of imans  preaching in (now more noticeable) mosques financed by Saudi-Arabia and of Salafist groups. The Salafists started a campaign with the nice name \"lies!\" (which is German for \"read!\", or could be ;-)  ), distributing Quran-editions for free. Part of the Salafist scene is ready to use violence (sometimes setting up street fight with hooligans and right-winged men). And they influence especially younger muslims, which contributed significantly to the number of >600 people traveling to Syria. ",
