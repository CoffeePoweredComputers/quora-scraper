            "answer_text": "Royal carpet is red for a reason - it is soaked in the blood of ALL the people kings have to kill to get there.  More than any, they have to kill the humanity inside themselves to grab the throne from all others who lay their claim to it.   This is as it has always been - since time immemorial. Ramayan is probably the only epic where Rama and his brothers were unwilling to stab each other in the back to get the throne.   Study the history and you will see that not only Ashoka, but most kings, Emperors, presidents, priminsters, chiefs, CEOs and general managers in all cultures have had to physically or metaphorically 'remove' their rivals to get to the top.  It is just the way it is - and will be - forever.  Here are just a few other examples - Aurangzeb killed a large number of brothers, cousins and relatives to get to the throne.  Mrs Margaret Thatcher was knifed in the back as Conservative MPs replaced her while she was still serving as the elected PM of England.  The Milliband brothers Ed and David fell out over leadership contest for UK's Labour party in 2010.   ",

            "answer_text": "As per Buddhist record Ashoka killed all his 99 brothers.. It can be a truth or may be myth. As Ashoka started following Buddhism, to show his cruelty and later he became so calm and started loving mankind\u2026 It can be biased a littl bit The dipavansa and Mahavansa. Almost Every emperor of Indian History has to fight with his brother, only one brother Sushim was killed by him is mentioned for the accession of throne. In Ashoka\u2019s edict it is mentioned that he love his brothers. ",
