            "answer_text": "I will focus on just one area. Most PRC histories give the impression that the Red Army (PLA) was a leading force in fighting the Japanese in WWII, and was instrumental in winning the war.  In fact, the Chinese Revolutionary Army under Chiang Kai-shek (the Nationalists) fought in most of the battles against the Japanese, and made the largest sacrifices. Mao, who was the head of the PLA, knew that the Communists and Nationalists would eventually fight a civil war to control all of China following the war, which was exactly what happened from 1945 to 1949. In fact, mainland China was still under the control of the Republic of China until 1949, and the People's Republic was only founded on October 1, 1949. When Japanese forces surrendered to the Allies in 1945, they surrendered to Nationalist forces in China, not the Communists. China was then one of the Big 5 among the allies, and was represented by the Republic of China. Therefore, it looks more than a little funny when Chinese President Xi Jinping presses forward with the 70th anniversary of the Allies victory celebration over the Japanese in WWII. He is the president of the People's Republic of China, which was not even in existence until Oct. 1, 1949. It was the Nationalists, now on Taiwan, who won over the Japanese in WWII and took the Japanese surrender, not the Communists. The role of the Chinese Communists in fighting the Japanese in WWII was relatively minor. What is worse is the treatment of Chinese Nationalist troops who fought in both WWII against the Japanese and then fought in the Chinese civil war against the Communists. Generally speaking they were treated badly, even though many of them fought bravely against the Japanese in WWII. But since they fought against the Communists in the civil war, they were treated as a defeated enemy, and were often ostracized in their own society, and suffered in the different political movements following the founding of the PRC, especially the Cultural Revolution.
