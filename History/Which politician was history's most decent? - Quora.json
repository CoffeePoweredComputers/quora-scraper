            "answer_text": "HISTORY\u2019S MOST DECENT POLITICIAN ? MEET COUNT PAUL TELEKI . In our post TwinTower world, suicides for religious/political convictions are quite common. Also to claim one\u2019s importance on social networks suicides are not quite unusual. But to commit suicide out of COMMON DECENCY I can think of only one example : Count Teleki P\u00e0l (The man was twice Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister and in Hungarian family names are mentioned first). Year 1920. After WW1 there was a red revolution in Budapest (just as in Vienna and Berlin) and order was re-established by Horthy an ex-Admiral of the Double Monarchy, He gave himself the title of Regent of Hungary and named Teleki his Prime Minister. Teleki was known for right wing ideas, as a matter of fact he enacted the first discriminatory law\u201d numerus clauses\u201d that limited the number of Jews admitted in the Universities. 1921 Charles IV the rightful king of Hungary, successor of Francis Joseph, showed up in the country and wanted to claim his throne. Horthy chased him away and kept the title of Regent\u2026however Teleki did not go along and shortly resigned. 1939 . World WAR 2 starts with the invasion of Poland. Teleki is again Prime Minister and he is sent to Germany to sign with Hitler a pact of friendship.  However when the Germans asks Hungary to allow their troops to use the Hungarian railroad lines towards Poland Teleki refuses. He does not believe that Hungary should depend exclusively upon the Axis powers and goes to sign a friendship pact with Yougoslavia. He believes that his country should not become a vassal of Germany. April 1941 Hitler wants to attack Yougoslavia. He summons Horthy and demands that Hungary should declare war on that country and that it should let his troops pass through its territory. This time he would not take no for an answer.  Teleki states his position in a letter to Admiral Horthy. He admits that Hungary has no choice but he does not believe that it is honourable to sign a friendship pact with a neighbouring country and then let it be attacked. He had personally signed that pact. Any other politician would have resigned. Teleki took his gun and shot himself. ",
