            "answer_text": "Brahmins can trace their ancestry largely to \u201csteppe migrations\u201d from modern day Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine. A foreign origin for the Indo-Aryans has always been the dominant academic idea, and the recent Rakhigarhi findings only further diminish the strength of the claim that our ancestors were native to India. So, yes: Brahmin ancestors, as well as their proto-language and proto-culture, came from \u201cAryan migrations\u201d or \u201cinvasions\u201d, or whatever you want to call it. Whether we belong to India or not is up to whoever asks the question- plenty of people are more than willing to say that we do not belong to India, but that we do believe that India belongs to us, because we are conquerors and oppressors, just like our \u201cAryan ancestors.\u201d However, consider that many of us don\u2019t like to acknowledge the Aryan migration- we only accept it because that is what the science says. This is because we are attached to India- even if it is not our genetic and linguistic homeland, it is certainly our spiritual and cultural homeland, and it has always been. It was here that Sanskrit, the so-called \u201cBrahmin language\u201d, evolved and flourished- it was here that various cultures melded to form the Vedic culture, as well as so many colorful later cultures. The only reason that Brahmins and their culture exist is because of India- if they had stayed on the steppes, they would have been just another group of Indo-Europeans, and they probably would have been wiped out or completely absorbed by various future migrations and invasions of the steppes. I do not deny the various inequities that my ancestors created or upheld. However, I do have faith that at least some of us have always believed in wisdom and love over dogma and discrimination: that some of us considered and treated those non-Brahmins around us, lower caste and tribal, as our spiritual family, even though historical records do not indicate this. So while Brahmins come from outside of India, they do belong to India, as they always have. ",

            "answer_text": "Dear friends, I have been going through Aryan migration hypothesis since long and trying to work out what might be the reality as we are not able to procure a written history of some 10000 to 20000 year old. But still, based on the comments of several experts, linguists, politicians, researchers, etc. I thank these academicians that I could arrive at a certain destination which I think does not carry any political ideology but a sense of patriotism. 1. ROOTS OF SANSKRIT TO THE EAST ASIA. This is where I think I must begin with the migration of those people of the region somewhere around 30 to 40 thousands year ago where they used to stay on an undivided plate of West Asia, North Africa and Southern Europe or Caucasus together as a single landmass. As we are very much familiar with the theory of tectonic shifts of different landmass, we can simply conclude that modern continents are the consequences of the same since the formation of the Earth, these people who spoke same language what we call it today as Proto-Indo-iranian (modern day Iran and middle east) or Proto-Indo-European (modern day Caucasus) with both might had some variation as it was a vast area, gradually migrated towards different regions owing to the drastic climatic conditions or natural calamities and settled in a different regions including Indian subcontinent. These people started mingling with the local cultures of the places where they could migrate and developed the regional cultures and this is the reason why we see the similarities in between modern European, ancient avestan, Sanskrit, etc. languages. 2. DEVELOPMENT OF SANSKRIT WITH THE HELP OF LOCAL INDIAN LANGUAGES. The people from this Afro-eurasian plate when migrated to India, they started mixing with the different cultures of India and their languages. Gradually these migrated people's language borrowed vocabulary, some grammar,etc to get developed into more prosperous and rich language what we call it as a Sanskrit.With this we can contradict the statement which says Sanskrit is the mother of most of the Indian languages. These migrated people along with the Indian people started expanding this language and from here Vedic era was born with Sanskrit as a high culture, religious and liturgical language. Hence we can say that Sanskrit is a result of Indian culture more than any other as it was no where before the migration of Afro-eurasian people and also Vedic culture is much Indian as it was also no where before the migration of the same people. Now any one may argue regarding the roots of Vedic culture. So let me tell you that even of some Vedic rituals like Homa- Havana is similar to fire worship of Persian people, what about other 90% works and philosophies of Vedas which are born in India and what about Ayurveda and what about Yoga which has no roots anywhere but in India. At the time when Vedic culture was developing in India, there were several other cultures already existed India like that of forest dwelling Indians. But even with that Vedic culture has been a result of combination of different India customs and from there it developed an unique culture which has been predominant in India. 3. WHY INDIA IS ONLY QUESTIONED ABOUT ITS INDIGENEITY? As we know we find social stratification in India, we do find similar system in ancient Avestan, and ancient Greek civilization. This is because as I have already clarified these Cultures have roots in Afro-eurasian region. But what makes the difference here in India is all these cultures with whom we compare our Vedic culture regarding their ancestry are all gone and our Vedic culture which is developed in our country still exists. There has been a migration in UK, Arabia, Europe, America, etc. where no main stream culture is indigenous. We Indians are much Indigenous but always asked about our ancestry. Yes, we have been fighting against the ills like social stratification in India and we are about to completely clear it, we cannot abandon and isolate ourselves from our age old rich culture just because of single illness. We are definitely defeating it. So all my Indians don't segregate yourself from your fellow Indians and call yourself from different communities and fringes. Unite yourself with each other and make India as one single cultural entity with different subcultures. DHANYAWAD. ",
