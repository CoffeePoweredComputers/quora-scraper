As far as I know after the demographic collapse derivated from the conquest, the archipielago was recolonized by inmigrants mainly from Andalucia but also from Galicia,Castilla and Portugal. However it would be a shame not to mention the persistence of a native population as well as a important presence of genovese and flamingo merchants and a north african significant body of slaves.
