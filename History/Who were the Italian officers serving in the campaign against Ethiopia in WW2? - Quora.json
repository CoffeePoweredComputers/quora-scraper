            "answer_text": "Ethiopia Campaign was before 1939 : \u201cModern Italian colonial ambitions into Ethiopia began in the 1880s. This was eventually followed by the Italo-Ethiopian War of 1887\u20131889, in which Italy occupied the Ethiopian territory in present-day Eritrea, founding the colony of Italian Eritrea. Years later, the disputed Treaty of Wuchale led to the First Italo-Ethiopian War between 1894 and 1896, where the Ethiopians (supported by Russia and France) successfully fought off European expansion. Following World War I and the rise of Italian Fascism, the Abyssinia Crisis began, and eventually culminated in the 1935\u20131936 Second Italo-Ethiopian War. It was a brutal conflict: the Ethiopians used prohibited Dum-dum bullets and began mutilating captured soldiers (often with castration) since the first weeks of war, while the Italians used chemical warfare. Ethiopia lost its independence and became Italian Ethiopia, part of Italian East Africa. Italy eventually lost its colonies in the region. Following years of local resistance and the intervention of British troops during the East African Campaign of World War II, scattered Italian forces continued to fight in a guerrilla war, until the final surrender in 1943. Ethiopia regained its independence from Italy in 1947.\u201d For more [Second Italo-Ethiopian War - Wikipedia] ",

            "answer_text": "Jean, If I understand your question correctly the war between Italy and Abyssinia was in 1935, and Italy using poison gas aircraft and tanks beat a totally helpless country. It\u2019s the only country they defeated due too the impotence of a country using spears axes and were barefoot. Yes the Italian officers were fighting for Il Duce, and what a motley crew they were. Big tough Italy beating up on a defenseless country, and the Leagud of Nations didn\u2019t do a damn thing against Italy. Shame shame \ud83d\ude29. ",
