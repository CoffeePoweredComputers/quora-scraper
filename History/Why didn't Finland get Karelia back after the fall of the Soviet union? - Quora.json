            "answer_text": "One could similarly ask why Poland didn't get back its eastern territories and cede its western ones and east Prussia to Germany. Or why the Kaliningrad Oblast would not be included in the package\u2026 and why Lithuania didn\u2019t have to cede Vilnius/Wilno to Poland. Karelia, for its part was Annexed to RUSSIA during the war, while Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania were annexed as constituent republics into the USSR. in 1991 the USSR ceased to legally exist, while Russia continued its legal existence. Had Karelia been annexed as a constituent Soviet Socialist Republic of the USSR, its independence would have likely come, followed by reunion with Finland. ",

Had Finland initiated talks on Karelia\u2019s future status with Yeltsin\u2019s Russia, \u201cquestions\u201d would have ensued: the Silesian \u201cquestion\u201d, the \u201cquestion\u201d of East Prussia, you name it. Honestly, does somebody think Finland, of all countries, could have done something as rash and destabilizing as this? ",
