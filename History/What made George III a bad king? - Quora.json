            "answer_text": "The trouble with Thomas Jefferson besides being a slave owning hypocrite he was also ignorant of the British Parliamentary system, considering he revolted against the British on their taxes and laws he should have studied them a bit. Under the British Parliamentary system since Queen Anne the Monarchs ministers make the decisions and the Monarchs simply rubber stamp them, this means that Jefferson in his diatribe against King George III was talking through his ignorant backside. This wouldn't matter much if it wasn't for the fact his anti King George III words are taught as if they were the laws of the Medes and Persians in American history lessons. We know this how? Because questions about this basically decent man couched in derogative terms keep cropping up on Quora from Americans. The saying is ignorance is bliss. ",
