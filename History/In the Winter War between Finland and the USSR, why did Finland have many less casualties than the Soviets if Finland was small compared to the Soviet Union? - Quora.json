            "answer_text": "Finnish troops were highly motivated to defend their homeland, as they knew there was nobody else to protect their nation from the Soviet attack that everyone knew was totally unjustified and fatally dangerous. The effect of Soviet propaganda was less convincing for agitating the Red Army, and their leaders were incompetent after Stalin\u2019s purges had killed their best officers in the late 1930\u2019s.  The Finnish Army was trained to operate in the conditions of Finland in all seasons, and despite that its mission was to defend the country, the training emphasized activity and seizing the initiative, instead of passively waiting for the enemy to attack.  Mobility was one of the keys, as the small numbers of Finns could never match the numeric superiority of the enemy \u2013 therefore, flanking operations and ambushes were necessary. In Finnish Winter, cross-country skis and the skill in using them was the means of mobility anywhere, including on the frozen lakes. Soldiers in Lapland were even accustomed to using the half-wild reindeer as their means of transport with ahkio sleighs.  Soviet units were dependent on roads for their convoys, which could be destroyed by much smaller forces by unexpectedly stopping them, cutting them to pockets that could then be destroyed piecemeal. This was never planned before the war, it was an innovation that was quickly adopted as it brought such brilliant results.  Hannu Mononen's answer to When the Soviets invaded Finland during the Winter War, why didn't they use the elite Siberian divisions to fight that conflict instead of the poorly trained conscripts they ended up sending that got massacred in the beginning stages of the conflict? A simple device to reduce casualties in winter warfare was the white snow camouflage suit, which was easy to produce in the home front by the thousands, using the cloth for bed sheets. The Finnish snipers and ski patrols came like ghosts from the wintery forest, causing also the psychological effect of Belaya smert, the White Death. After aggressively using their firepower, the Finns just vanished. Surprisingly enough, the attacking Soviet forces mostly didn\u2019t have it, making them easily visible targets in their brown mantles and Budyonnovka caps against the white snow. The winter temperatures in 1939\u201340 were record low, often below \u2013 40\u00b0 (both Celsius and Fahrenheit, as the scales coincide there). In terms of casualties, it means high risk for frostbite for those unprepared to protect themselves. And exposure to such extreme cold can lead to hypothermia and death, if a tired soldier falls asleep in the snow. Finns had tents that ski patrols could pull in sleighs with them, with a furnace for firewood and a chimney pipe to lead out the smoke and carbon monoxide, thus being able to rest in warmth and even prepare hot meals and drinks.  The Soviets burned bonfires under open sky that produced smoke and bright light advertising their presence in the dark, inviting Finnish patrols to strike. Their alternative could have been freezing to death. Many of the Soviet units were brought from warmer climate like Ukraine, where no one had experienced anything like a Finnish winter. The Red Army used human waves to attack against Finnish fortified positions in the Karelian Isthmus, causing themselves enormous casualties in the fire of machine guns and other infantry weapons, wave after wave. The RKKA also served vodka for encouraging their attacking troops, not at all improving their performance on the battlefield. However, the Soviets also learned from their experience and improved their tactics to use their material superiority in wearing down Finnish positions on the Karelian Isthmus. For a nation of 3.8 million at the time, it is no easy task keeping up the defence against a great power of 170 million. Being outnumbered and suffering from shortage of ammunition, without serious outside military help but Swedish and other Nordic volunteers in Lapland, the prognosis for the Finns seemed poor.  Fortunately, the world was not a vacuum even in 1939\u201340, and media publicity during the otherwise uneventful phoney war (Sitzkrieg) period on other fronts gave international attention to the unfair war in the North. Finnish determined self-defence with success caused enough sympathy in civilized countries to lead to planning of sending military expeditions for help. Symbolic intentions were unrealistic and mostly never materialized, but the British and French preparations really frightened Stalin about ruining his grand strategy against Germany in case the Western great powers actually became involved in war against the Red Army, so he finally gave up his plan of taking all of Finland and settled for the time being just for the better positions for his next attack, as agreed upon in the Moscow peace of 12 March 1940. Hannu Mononen's answer to How far did the Red Army advance in combat on the Karelian Isthmus in the Winter War 1939-40? In his Order of the Day Number 34 after the peace was made, Finland\u2019s Supreme Commander, Marshal Mannerheim crystallized the national experience of the Finns in a brilliant manner: Hannu Mononen's answer to Is Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim a good or a bad guy given what he did in World War II?

            "answer_text": "Firstly Finland was surprisingly well prepared\u2026 A very reputable Russian historian, Isayev, claims the war was not about Finnish brilliant defence, but more likely failed Finnish advance.. However there were multiple reasons for that Soviet Command (Stalin) didn\u2019t approve of submachine guns, thinking no self respecting Army should use gangster weapons. Finns had nor such qualms and happily equipped its army with submachine guns.. which were extremely effective in ambushes and close combats\u2026 Needless to say Soviet Command quickly learned the lessons and put existing Soviet designs into production. (To be fair Soviets did have very respectable automatic rifles like SVT-38 which were later copied by Belgians, Austrians and others and one copy, FN-FAL, almost became main NATO assault gun, had it not been for Americans pushing their own copy of German STG-44, which we know as M16).Finnish tactics\u2026Modern day biathlon was introduced to Olympic Games as a tribute to Finnish troops fighting Red Army.. While Finnish reliance on small fighter groups on skis helped cause a lot of damage to Red Army they could never secure victory.Extremely low temperatures\u2026 Contrary to popular myths Winter was never a favourable time for Russian(Soviet) Armies. Such low temperatures are even beyond acceptable parameter range in war simulation computers. Equipment would freeze technological advantage of the Red Army.",
