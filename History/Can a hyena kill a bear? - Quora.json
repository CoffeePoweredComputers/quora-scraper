            "answer_text": "Certainly, anything is possible, but a single hyena killing a bear on it\u2019s own is very unlikely. Because: Bears, even young bears, are much larger than hyenas, and can withstand much more powerful blows than hyenas.Bears kill by grabbing (bear hug ?) and striking with their forearms, and biting. A single well - placed blow could kill an average hyena.Hyenas kill by inficting many, many bites, after chasing/harrassing their prey to the point of exhaustion. Often hyenas\u2019 prey are bleeding and their guts hanging out from hyenas\u2019 bites when they finally collapse. A single hyena could never accomplish such a feat with a bear unless the bear were disabled or greatly comprimised already.Hyenas very rarely hunt and kill alone. They are pack animals. Almost never 1 on 1.Bears often hunt and kill alone. Grizzly bears have been filmed chasing, catching, killing, and eating prey as large as full grown buffalos alone.It is unfathomable that a healthy bear would run from a single hyena. Much more likely is the bear, once it realizes the hyena is actually trying to hurt him, faces the hyena, charges, clamps his huge jaws down on the hyena\u2019s head and crushes the life out of him. Then, casually tosses him aside. Done.Still, \u2026\u2026anything is possible. Bet on the bear, though.",

            "answer_text": "Can a hyena kill a bear? In this one on one hypothetical situation, it depends of which sub-species of hyena or bear, a spotted hyena can probably take care of a black bear, brown or grizzly bear? may not not. But sure could give that grizzly a good run for its money. Hyenas are simply more aggressive. Or a cackle of hyena kill a bear?sure thing, hyenas aren\u2019t afraid to harass lion or even pride of lions. Hyenas are very brave and aggressive, a lot more so than bears. If Hyenas aren\u2019t so ugly, super smelly, and strange anatomy (hanging clitoris and all), we may crown them the queen of the jungle. ",

Itd need to be an alpha female spotted hyena vs a juvenile bear or one of the smallest black beat types, one thats not over 100lbs. It still will not be easy prey.
