            "answer_text": "A geoglyph is mainly a design on land. Geoglyphs can be positive as well as a negative. A negative Geoglyph is mainly constructed by removing the segments of the ground and a positive geoglyph is constructed mainly by putting certain stones or objects in an arranged manner. Some of the most famous geoglyphs which I came across while looking for the answer are Paracas candelabra (Peru)  Known as the trident, paracas candelabra is belived to have been built by the paracas culture. They are belived to have built other geoglyphs all over peru. It is a 600 feet (length vise) geoglyph. Nobody knows what does it signify. Cerne Abbas Giant (England)  Cerne Abbas giant or as they term it as the Rude man of Cerne, is belived to be the representation of Hercules with a club in his hands. There are confusions as to the time it was built in. Some scholars argue that it was built in 1600s and some argue that it was made during the medieval period. Uffington white horse (England)  The Uffington white horse is made with white chalk and is belived to be at l east 260 feet in length. It is belived to be depicting a solar deity. There are other horse geoglyphs in the England. There is not much clarity as to what it represents, some say it represents a saber tooth cat, a dog and a running horse. To asnwer your original question - No, I have not seen a geoglyph but your question surely has added something to my to do list. Your question did surely increase my knowledge. Thanks for the A2A. ",
