            "answer_text": "History depends on documents; archaeology depends on material remains. Documents represent the recollection of person(s) who were on the scene, perhaps, or have been told about a certain event or circumstance. Both are subject to interpretation. For a long time, at least since 1936 (\u201cMan Makes Himself\u201d by V. Gordon Childe) it was felt that agriculture was the beginning of civilization. This led to a series of assumptions, such as hunters and gatherers were nomadic, ceramics were developed for the storage of grains, etc. etc. etc. Then Gobleki Tepe and its surrounding villages were found in the 1990s and all such opinions were contradicted. So if you want to write the history of the world now, you have to realize that hunters and gatherers lived in settled villages with substantial houses and plenty of ceramics. No sign of agriculture. So to be brief, it is archaeology and the associated sciences that help the historian. ",
