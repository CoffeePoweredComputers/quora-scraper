            "answer_text": "The Aftermath of World War I saw drastic political, cultural, economic, and social change across Eurasia, Africa, and even in areas outside those that were directly involved. Four empires collapsed due to the war, old countries were abolished, new ones were formed, boundaries were redrawn, international organisations were established, and many new and old ideologies took a firm hold in people's minds. WWI also had the effect of bringing political transformation to most of the principal parties involved in the conflict, transforming them into electoral democracies by bringing near-universal suffrage for the first time in history.  While discussions were on going between the conflict\u2019s victors, these intervened against the Bolscheviks in Russia, as Lenin had signed a peace treaty with Imperial Germany. There was even a Greek Army sent to SouthEastern Ukraine.  The dismemberment of the four dynastic Empires (German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, Russian) into democratic ethnic states was based on US President Wilson\u2019s declaration that the United States' objective was \"to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world.\" In several speeches earlier in the year, Wilson sketched out his vision of an end to the war that would bring a just and secure peace not merely a new balance of power. President Wilson subsequently initiated a secret series of studies, primarily focused on Europe, and carried out by a group in New York which included geographers, historians and political scientists. Their job was to study Allied and American policy in virtually every region of the globe and analyse economic, social, and political facts likely to come up in discussions during the peace conference. The group produced and collected nearly 2,000 separate reports and documents plus at least 1,200 maps. The studies culminated in a speech by Wilson to Congress on January 8, 1918, wherein he articulated America's long-term war objectives. The speech was the clearest expression of intention made by any of the belligerent nations, and it projected Wilson's progressive domestic policies into the international arena. Wilson\u2019s 14 points: I. Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall be no Private International Understandings of any kind but diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view. II. Absolute Freedom of Navigation upon the seas, outside territorial waters, alike in peace and in war, except as the seas may be closed in whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of international covenants. III. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance. IV. Adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments will be reduced to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety. V. A free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable government whose title is to be determined. VI. The evacuation of all Russian territory and such a settlement of all questions affecting Russia as will secure the best and freest cooperation of the other nations of the world in obtaining for her an unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent determination of her own political development and national policy and assure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free nations under institutions of her own choosing; and, more than a welcome, assistance also of every kind that she may need and may herself desire. The treatment accorded Russia by her sister nations in the months to come will be the acid test of their good will, of their comprehension of her needs as distinguished from their own interests, and of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy. VII. Belgium, the whole world will agree must be evacuated and restored, without any attempt to limit the sovereignty which she enjoys in common with all other free nations. No other single act will serve as this will serve to restore confidence among the nations in the laws which they have themselves set and determined for the government of their relations with one another. Without this healing act the whole structure and validity of international law is forever impaired. VIII. All French territory should be freed and the invaded portions restored, and the wrong done to France by Prussia in 1871 in the matter of Alsace Lorraine, which has unsettled the peace of the world for nearly fifty years, should be righted, in order that peace may once more be made secure in the interest of all. IX. A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along clearly recognisable lines of nationality. X. The people of Austria Hungary, whose place among the nations we wish to see safeguarded and assured, should be accorded the freest opportunity to autonomous development. XI. Romania, Serbia and Montenegro should be evacuated; occupied territories restored; Serbia accorded free and secure access to the sea; and the relations of the several Balkan states to one another determined by friendly counsel along historically established lines of allegiance and nationality; and international guarantees of the political and economic independence and territorial integrity of the several Balkan states should be entered into. XII. The Turkish portion of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under Ottoman rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development, and the Dardanelles should be permanently opened as a free passage to the ships and commerce of all nations under international guarantees. XIII. An Independent Polish state should be erected which should include the territories inhabited by indisputable Polish populations, which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international covenant. XIV. A general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike. The Aftermath: To keep matters in perspective, estimated pre-WW I GDP (in 2000 intnl $) of the British empire was 351 Bln, the German empire\u2019s 126, the French empire\u2019s 108 , Italy\u2019s 49 and the Ottoman empire\u2019s 18. ref Cambridge University Press The evolution of fiscal institutions in the Ottoman Empire, 1500 Conditions on the Continent were bad for every belligerent. Britain sustained the lightest damage to its civilian economy, apart from its loss of men. The major damage was to its merchant marine and to its financial holdings. Post WWI GDP shrinkage in Austria, Russia, France and the Ottoman Empire reached 30 to 40%  The United States and Canada prospered during the war. The reparations levied on Germany by the treaty of Versailles were, in theory, supposed to restore the damage to the civilian economies, but little of the reparations money went for that. Most of Germany's reparations payments were funded by loans from American banks, and the recipients used them to pay off loans they had from the U.S. Treasury. Between 1919 and 1932, Germany paid out 19 billion gold marks in reparations, and received 27 billion gold marks in loans from New York bankers and others. These loans were eventually paid back by Germany after World War II.  A) In Germany, there was a socialist revolution which led to the brief establishment of a number of communist political systems in (mainly urban) parts of the country, the abdication of Wilhelm II, and the creation of the Weimar Republic. On 28 June 1919 the Weimar Republic was forced, under threat of continued Allied advance, to sign the Treaty of Versailles. Germany viewed the one-sided treaty as a humiliation and as blaming it for the entire war. While the intent of the treaty was to assign guilt to Germany to justify financial reparations, the notion of blame took root as a political issue in German society and was never accepted by nationalists. In view of the disaster imposed by German Imperial forces on Belgium and Northern France which had been turned into rubble, war reparations were demanded in the tune of 132 billion gold marks ($31.5 billion, 6.6 billion pounds), of which only 50 billion had to be paid. In order to finance the purchases of foreign currency required to pay off the reparations, the new German republic printed tremendous amounts of money \u2013 to disastrous effect.  B) Austria Hungary: As the central government had ceased to operate in vast areas, these regions found themselves without a government and many new groups attempted to fill the void. During this same period, the population was facing food shortages and was, for the most part, demoralized by the losses incurred during the war. Various political parties, ranging from ardent nationalists, to social democrats, to communists attempted to set up governments in the names of the different nationalities. In other areas, existing nation states such as Romania engaged regions that they considered to be theirs. These moves created de facto governments that complicated life for diplomats, idealists, and the Western allies. The Western forces were officially supposed to occupy the old Empire, but rarely had enough troops to do so effectively. They had to deal with local authorities who had their own agenda to fulfil. At the peace conference in Paris the diplomats had to reconcile these authorities with the competing demands of the nationalists who had turned to them for help during the war, the strategic or political desires of the Western allies themselves, and other agendas such as a desire to implement the spirit of the Fourteen Points. For example, in order to live up to the ideal of self-determination laid out in the Fourteen Points, Germans, whether Austrian or German, should be able to decide their own future and government. However, the French especially were concerned that an expanded Germany would be a huge security risk. Further complicating the situation, delegations such as the Czechs and Slovenians made strong claims on some German-speaking territories. The result was treaties that compromised many ideals, offended many allies, and set up an entirely new order in the area. Many people hoped that the new nation states would allow for a new era of prosperity and peace in the region, free from the bitter quarrelling between nationalities that had marked the preceding fifty years. This hope proved far too optimistic.  C) Russia: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia gained independence. They were occupied again by the Soviet Union in 1940. Finland gained a lasting independence, though she repeatedly had to fight the Soviet Union for her borders. Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan were established as independent states in the Caucasus region. However, after withdrawal of the Russian army in 1917 and during the 1920 Turkish invasion of Armenia, Turkey captured the Armenian territory around Arvin, Kars, and Igdir, and these territorial losses became permanent. As consequence of invasions of Turkey and Russian Red Army all three Transcaucasian countries were proclaimed as Soviet Republics in 1920 and over time were absorbed into the Soviet Union. Romania gained Bessarabia from Russia.  D) Ottoman empire In the Ottoman Empire Turkish nationalists took control before the war began. They drove out Greeks and Armenians who had been the backbone of the business community, replacing them with ethnic Turks who were given favourable contracts but lacked the international connections, credit sources, and entrepreneurial skills needed for business. (ref Erik J. Z\u00fcrcher (2004). Turkey: A Modern History, Revised Edition. p. 126. ISBN 9781860649585 ). The Ottoman economy was based on subsistence agriculture; there was very little industry. Turkish tobacco and wheat were in high demand, but transportation was rudimentary and not much of it reached Germany. The war cut off imports except from Germany. Prices quadrupled. The Germans provided loans and supplied the army with hardware, especially captured Belgian and Russian equipment. Other materials were in short supply; the soldiers were often in rags. Medical services were very bad and illness and death rates were high. To keep matters in perspective, estimated pre-WW I GDP (in 2000 intnl $) of the British empire was 351 Bln, the German empire\u2019s 126, the French empire\u2019s 108 , Italy\u2019s 49 and the Ottoman empire\u2019s 18. ref Cambridge University Press The evolution of fiscal institutions in the Ottoman Empire, 1500 Britain, France, Imperial Russia and Italy had already decided how to carve out the Ottoman Empire after the war. The expression of these agreements were materialised in 1916 by the secret Franco-British Sykes-Picot deal. The agreement is seen by many as a turning point in Western and Arab relations. It negated UK\u2019s promises to Arabs, regarding a national Arab homeland in the area of greater Syria in exchange for supporting the British against the Ottoman Empire. The agreement, along with others, was exposed to the public by the Bolsheviks in Moscow on 23 November 1917 and repeated in the British Guardian on November 26, 1917, such that \"the British were embarrassed, the Arabs dismayed and the Turks delighted\". The agreement's legacy has led to much resentment in the region, among Arabs in particular but also among Kurds who were denied an independent state. At the end of the war, the Allies occupied Constantinople (Istanbul) and the Ottoman government collapsed. The Treaty of Sevres, designed to repair damage caused by Ottomans during the war to the winning Allies, was signed by Ottoman Empire on August 10th, 1920, but was never ratified by the Sultan. The areas affected by the Sykes-Picot agreement became \u201cmandates\u201d in the Sevres Treaty following Wilson\u2019s points, in view of their future independence.  Armenia and Kurdistan, Wilson\u2019s proposals:  At the outbreak of World War I, Asia Minor was ethnically diverse, its population including Turks and Azeris, as well as the native groups that had inhabited the region prior to the Turkish conquest, including Greeks, Armenians, Kurds, Zazas, Georgians, Circassians, Laz, Assyrians and Jews. The occupation of Smyrna by Greece on 18 May 1919 triggered a nationalist movement to rescind the terms of the Treaty. Turkish revolutionaries led by Mustafa Kemal, a successful Ottoman commander, rejected the terms enforced at S\u00e8vres and under the guise of General Inspector of the Ottoman Army, left Istanbul for Samsun to organize the remaining Ottoman forces to resist the terms of the Treaty. On the eastern front, after the invasion of Armenia in 1920 and signing of the Treaty of Kars with soviet Russia. Turkey took over territory lost to Armenia and post-Imperial Russia. Fearing that Allied control would prevent Russian merchant and naval ships access to the Straits, while simultaneously preventing the establishment of a new liberal world order, Lenin provided Kemal with significant amounts of weapons ad ammunition as well as 11 million gold roubles. https://sistem.nevsehir.edu.tr/bizdosyalar/0d4c19729f64fc4c85bf109ed8ec0f08/48(2017)-Mustafa-Kemal-and-Turkey-in-the-Correspondences-of-Soviet-Bureaucrats.pdf With the de-facto Turkish refusal to accept the Treaty of Sevres\u2019 terms, the Allies were faced with its enforcement. Furthermore the issue of the massive Ottoman debt (equivalent to 100% of pre-war Ottoman GDP) which was held by France (60%), Germany (21%) and the UK (14%) remained an important factor requiring future Turkish cooperation. b) In the UK: In the United Kingdom, funding WWI had a severe economic cost. From being the world's largest overseas investor, it became one of its biggest debtors with interest payments forming around 40% of all government spending. Inflation more than doubled between 1914 and its peak in 1920, while the value of the Pound Sterling (consumer expenditure) fell by 61.2%. War reparations in the form of free German coal depressed the local coal industry. British private investments abroad were sold, raising \u00a3550 million. However, \u00a3250 million in new investment also took place during the war. The net financial loss was therefore approximately \u00a3300 million; less than two years investment compared to the pre-war average rate and more than replaced by 1928. Material loss was \"slight\": the most significant being 40% of the British merchant fleet sunk by German U-boats. The outbreak of the Irish War of Independence led to the creation of the Irish free state in 1919, representing a territorial loss for the UK that was all but equal to the loss sustained by Germany, (and furthermore, compared to Germany, a much greater loss in terms of its ratio to the country's prewar territory). Lastly, in the British Colonies: for Australia the cost of the war was \u00a3377 million, of which 70% was borrowed and the rest came from taxes. Overall, the war had a significantly negative impact on the Australian economy. Real aggregate GDP declined by 9.5 percent over the period 1914 to 1920, while the mobilisation of personnel resulted in a 6 percent decline in civilian employment. South Africa's main economic role was in the supply of two-thirds of the gold production in the British Empire (most of the remainder came from Australia). When the war began Bank of England officials worked with the government of South Africa to block any gold shipments to Germany, and force the mine owners to sell only to the Treasury, at prices set by the Treasury. This facilitated purchases of munitions and food in the U.S, and other neutrals. By 1919 London lost control to the mining companies (which were now backed by the South African government). c) France: The German invasion captured 40% of France's heavy industry in 1914, especially in steel and coal. French GDP in 1918 was 24% smaller than in 1913; since a third went into the war effort, the civilian standard of living fell by half. But thousands of little factories opened up across France, hiring women, youth, elderly and disabled veterans. Algerian and Vietnamese labourers were brought in. The US provided much food, steel, coal and machine tools, and $3.6 billion in loans to finance it all; the British loaned another $3 billion. The economy was supported after 1917 by American government loans which were used to purchase foods and manufactured goods. The arrival of over a million American soldiers in 1918 brought heavy spending for food and construction materials. France's diverse regions suffered in different ways. While the occupied area in 1913 contained only 14% of France's industrial workers, it produced 58% of the steel, and 40% of the coal. For its operations in the Levant, France was promised by Britain vast amounts of equipment and supplies which never materialised. d) Italy: Italy joined the Allies in 1915, but was poorly prepared for war. Loans from Britain paid for nearly all its war expenses, while its GDP decreased by 7%. The Italian army was poorly led and lacked heavy artillery and machine guns. The industrial base was too small to provide adequate amounts of modern equipment, the old-fashioned rural base did not produce much of a food surplus and the whole country was in a near famine situation. Before the war the government had ignored labour issues, but now it had to intervene to mobilise war production. With the main working-class Socialist party reluctant to support the war effort, strikes were frequent and cooperation was minimal, especially in the Socialist strongholds in the North. Inflation doubled the cost of living. Industrial wages kept pace but not wages for farm workers. Discontent was high in rural areas since so many men were taken for service, industrial jobs were unavailable, wages grew slowly and inflation was just as bad. e) Greece The Balkan Wars and WWI annihilated wealth creation by export oriented Greek companies in the Ottoman Empire and Russia. Food supply was severely disrupted and Greeks faced near famine conditions. The Greek military received second hand equipment left by the Allies after the Macedonian front\u2019s collapse in 1918. Greek holdings in Eastern Thrace and Asia Minor were deemed militarily indefensible by the Greeks themselves and could not exist without the Allies\u2019 direct support. Between 1913 and 1920 around 800000 Greek speaking Ottoman citizen were displaced and the lowest estimates indicated that 250000 had been killed in the process. A Multidimensional Analysis of the Events in Eski Fo\u00e7a (\u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac \u03a6\u03ce\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1) on the period of Summer 1914-Emre Erol Greek debt as % of GDP  In conclusion: For \u201cmilitary secrecy\u201d reasons, the precise impact of the 1918\u20131920 flu pandemic (officially 50 million dead) on the Allies\u2019 armed forces in Europe has been little reported. The Allies were able to enforce the Treaty of Versailles upon Germany because of the physical presence of 11 million British, French and American troops poised on its borders. The same Allies didn\u2019t have to intervene in Austro-Hungary as the Central European Empire fell apart on its own. The French and their local allies (Alawis, Druzes and Armenians) in the Levant mustered 80000 troops, occupying Cilicia, Bursa, Eregli and Zonguldak, the Greek army landed 80000 in Smyrna, the British 30000 in the Straits region and the Italians 20000 in Antalya. Following a clash between British forces and Turkish nationalists in Izmit, Field Marshall Ferdinand Foch concluded that 27 fully equipped divisions (equivalent to 1,5 million men) would be sufficient to defeat Kemal\u2019s forces and occupy Turkey, but such a deployment would have been unacceptable to the British electorate as WWI had just ended. The crux was reached when Britain\u2019s colonies refused to finance what they saw as yet another British colonial war, bringing down Lloyd George\u2019s government. The \u201cCannakale Crisis\u201d eventually led to a de-facto Crown Colonies\u2019 independence from Britain. In view of regularising the situation with the Ottoman Empire successor state, solving the Ottoman debt issues and preventing further Soviet encroachment in the region, the parties negotiated the Lausanne Peace Treaty which was signed on July 24, 1923, the United States was not a party, since it had not been at war with Turkey.

            "answer_text": "Tl;dr: give arab world to saudi arabia? Sike, keep it for ourselves. U only get southern anatolia to live at. Mustafa kemal: Oh I don't think so. Sykes-picot treaty was harsher than the treaty of Versailles, or the treaty of saint german. Originally, the arab world (so the Levant, hedjaz and iraq) would be given to Saudi arabia. But since the British are big fat liars, this, ofcourse, didn't happen. The allies claimed the Levant and iraq, they dis give hejdaz though! Originally, anatolia would also be split by the majors; Greece gets west, italy gets south west, both brittian and france get the south Eastern part, constantinople (istanbul) would become an international zone and armenia gets the rest of eastern anatolia. The remains of the once great ottoman empire would be reduced to nothing, they would only have 1 major city, ankara (is suggest searching \u201csykes picot treaty on map\", to get a better view.). Greece claimed all italian parts of anatolia for themselves, and, Italy, not wanting any more trouble gave it. Now, in 1920 Mustafa kemal made a party of his own, the peoples republic party (CHP). The allies did not recognize this party, as there was still the ottoman empire. Mustafa, along with his followers fought off a war against great odds (with help of the russians, but not that much). Greece was the only one that had a foothold in anatolia (except everyone the international zone, istanbul), and they were also the hardest. After some great tactics by the marshal, Mustafa kemal, CHP booted the greeks off. He then threatened to attack constantinople, so the allies just gave up in anatolia and Mustafa kemal and the allies formed a new treaty, the treaty of lausanne. I'm just gonna oversimplify it: Anatolia = chp Arab world = allies CHP cancelled claims on land Allies cancelled war reps chp was supposed to give Then he created modern day Turkey. ",
