            "answer_text": "To differentiate between sleep, unconsciousness and coma, let's look at the definitions. Sleep: Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind and body, characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity and inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and reduced interactions with surroundings.Unconsciousness: Interruption of awareness of oneself and one's surroundings, lack of the ability to notice or respond to stimuli in the environment.Coma: A coma is a deep state of prolonged unconsciousness in which a person cannot be awakened; fails to respond normally to painful stimuli, light, or sound; lacks a normal wake-sleep cycle; and does not initiate voluntary actions.You'll see from the definitions that these three entities are basically the same thing\u2015 the lack of consciousness, but in varying degrees. Coma lies near the very end of the spectrum, just before vegetative state and death. Sleep lies at the very beginning of the spectrum. Since, this is a spectrum, the optimal method of recognizing and placing a level of unconsciousness on said spectrum is a scale\u2015 which is precisely what is used. There are many scales that have used over the years to varying accuracies (Matthew Lawson Scale, Blantyre Coma Scale, Rancho Los Amigos Scale, FOUR score).  The most commonly used and accurate scale used by medical professionals at present times is the Glasgow Coma Scale, or GCS for short. The scale was first established in 1974 and has seen changes over the year, but the basic format remains the same. To use this scale, you need to perform three sets of tests for the eye, verbal and motor response of the patient to your commands or pain, that you will need to inflict. Based on the patient's reaction, you put a score against each of the responses, as specified by the GCS.  Once you have completed the evaluation of the patient and noted the scores, add them up. lndividual elements as well as the sum of the score are important. Hence, the score is expressed in the form \"GCS 7 = E1 V3 M3 at 10:40\". Severity is classified as: Severe, with GCS<=8 (next integer of 1/2 of maximum possible score). Typically, patients with this score from any cause for more than 6 hours are considered in coma.Moderate, GCS 9\u201312.Minor, GCS >=13.So a GCS more than 8 represent varying levels of unconsciousness and sleep would be a 15 on this scale.

            "answer_text": "The doctor stimulates the patient to try to wake them up. Pinching, poking with a pin, etc. The person in a coma will not respond or will show only minimal autonomic response. A sleeping person will wake up, or at least flinch in pain. In fact, the various states of unconsiousness are described by the patient\u2019s level of response. The doctor follows a list of stimulations and notes the response to each, starting with things like poking and if there is a response, moves down the list to more sophisticated stimulations, such as squeezing the hand or talking. The patient in a coma may show some response to being poked. In my brother\u2019s case, the right side of his body was completely unresponsive in any way. But his left side showed minimal response. This is because his brain was most damaged on the left side, which controls the right side of his body. His skin on the right side was also colder than the left. In my brother\u2019s case, his eyes would open sometimes, later in his coma, but they would not focus on a moving object or track with it. He didn\u2019t respond to verbal stimulation, such as his name being called out. Other than autonomic response, like showing discomfort to pain, he was considered completely unresponsive. However, I was able to detect slight signs of response the doctor couldn\u2019t, so I knew there was a chance that he would continue to improve with further stimulation, which I provided. ",
