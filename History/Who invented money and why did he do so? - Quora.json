            "answer_text": "Anybody in his sane mind, who noticed that the population can\u2019t be bigger and more happy without the more and easier mixture of human capabilities, achieved by trade. Money mad the entire planet happy, yet, they say it doesn\u2019t buy happiness. Money made you able to have a company of 7.5 billion people and chose the best of them for yourself, including the trillions of stuffs they invent and produce. Yet, they say that the love of it is the root of all evil. It made the biggest possible order in the market, yet, they say that money causes wars and chaos. But let\u2019s just say that matches are becoming completely free. Everybody can have whatever amount they need. Some would build a house with matches, some would use it for heating exclusively with that in winter, and sooner or later we would run out of phosphor and woods. Since the workers who making the matches are paid by tax money (they can\u2019t have profit if the match is free), the chance of paying them the exact amount of money they worth is identical to zero. They either over or underpaid. Moreover, nobody can predict the correct demand of matches, since nobody knows who going to use them for what idiocy. As you can see, even this single thing could destroy the whole economy eventually. But it can\u2019t, since money is HERE and SAVES US from doing that. Wanting more money is the basis of production and of every achievement, yet, they say this is greed, and this is evil. On the other hand, laziness, portraying poverty as something good and money as something evil, is considered not a propaganda which killed billions of people through the history (by wars, poverty, criminality), but actually enlightenment which favors god and give you heaven in exchange. As the result, the bad guys think that they are the good guys, and they think that the good guys are the bad guys. This reversed truth gave all the power to the governments they have, has stolen amazing amount of time and money (time, opportunity) from you, leaving you to achieve the 1% of what you are meant to in this life. You just can\u2019t find more misled, more ignorant and more evil people than those who can found anything bad in money, instead of its entire goodness. And this is exactly why it has been made: to do good instead of bad. Which is not a hard task if so many ignorant idiot thinks that God is backing them and they are right, while they are wrong. A great man called this the arrogance of ignorance. And he was damn right. ",

            "answer_text": "The history of money concerns the development of social systems that provide at least one of the functions of money. Such systems can be understood as means of trading wealth indirectly; not directly as with barter. Money is a mechanism that facilitates this process. Money may take a physical form as in coins and notes, or may exist as a written or electronic account. It may have intrinsic value (commodity money), be legally exchangeable for something with intrinsic value (representative money), or only have nominal value (fiat money).  The invention of money took place before the beginning of written history. Consequently, any story of how money first developed is largely based on conjecture and logical inference. The significant evidence establishes many things were bartered in ancient markets that could be described as a medium of exchange. These included livestock and grain \u2013 things directly useful in themselves \u2013 but also merely attractive items such as cowrie shells or beads were exchanged for more useful commodities. However, such exchanges would be better described as barter, and the common bartering of a particular commodity (especially when the commodity items are not fungible) does not technically make that commodity \"money\" or a \"commodity money\" like the shekel \u2013 which was both a coin representing a specific weight of barley, and the weight of that sack of barley. Due to the complexities of ancient history (ancient civilizations developing at different paces and not keeping accurate records or having their records destroyed), and because the ancient origins of economic systems precede written history, it is impossible to trace the true origin of the invention of money and the transition from \"barter systems\" to the \"monetary systems\". Further, evidence in the histories supports the idea that money has taken two main forms divided into the broad categories of money of account (debits and credits on ledgers) and money of exchange (tangible media of exchange made from clay, leather, paper, bamboo, metal, etc.). The 20,000-year-old Ishango Bone \u2013 found near one of the sources of the Nile in the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 seems to use matched tally marks on the thigh bone of a baboon for correspondence counting. Regarding money of account, the tally stick can reasonably be described as a very primitive ledger \u2013 the oldest of which dates to the Aurignacian, about 30,000 years ago. While it may not be reasonable to conclude the most ancient tally sticks were used to keep accounting records in the monetary system sense of the term, their existence does show that \"accounting\" \u2013 keeping a written record of things counted \u2013 is far more ancient than many people assume. The 20,000-year-old Ishango Bone \u2013 found near one of the sources of the Nile in the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 seems to use matched tally marks on the thigh bone of a baboon for correspondence counting. Accounting records \u2013 in the monetary system sense of the term accounting \u2013 dating back more than 7,000 years have been found in Mesopotamia, and documents from ancient Mesopotamia show lists of expenditures, and goods received and traded and the history of accounting evidences that money of account pre-dates the use of coinage by several thousand years. David Graeber proposes that money as a unit of account was invented when the unquantifiable obligation \"I owe you one\" transformed into the quantifiable notion of \"I owe you one unit of something\". In this view, money emerged first as money of account and only later took the form of money of exchange. Regarding money of exchange, the use of representative money historically pre-dates the invention of coinage as well. In the ancient empires of Egypt, Babylon, India and China, the temples and palaces often had commodity warehouses which made use of clay tokens[2] and other materials which served as evidence of a claim upon a portion of the goods stored in the warehouses. Because these tokens could be redeemed at the warehouse for the commodity they represented, they were able to be traded in the markets as if they were the commodity or given to workers as payment. While not the oldest form of money of exchange, various metals (both common and precious metals) were also used in both barter systems and monetary systems and the historical use of metals provides some of the clearest illustration of how the barter systems gave birth to monetary systems. The Romans' use of bronze, while not among the more ancient examples is well documented, and it illustrates this transition clearly. First, the \"aes rude\" (rough bronze) was used. This was a heavy weight of unmeasured bronze used in what was probably a barter system\u2014the barter-ability of the bronze was related exclusively to its usefulness in blacksmithing and it was bartered with the intent of being turned into tools. The next historical step was bronze in bars that had a 5-pound pre-measured weight (presumably to make barter easier and more fair), called \"aes signatum\" (signed bronze), which is where debate arises between if this is still the barter system or now a monetary system. Finally, there is a clear break from the use of bronze in barter into its undebatable use as money because of lighter measures of bronze not intended to be used as anything other than coinage for transactions. The aes grave (heavy bronze) (or As) is the start of the use of coins in Rome, but not the oldest known example of metal coinage. Source: Wikipedia ",
