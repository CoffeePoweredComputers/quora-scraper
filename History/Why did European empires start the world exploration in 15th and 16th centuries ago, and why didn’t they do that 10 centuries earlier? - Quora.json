            "answer_text": "First of all there were no European Empires in 1st century AD. The only empire was the Roman empire. The rest of Europe was inhabited by tribes without any kind of central governance. So why didn't Rome explore the globe? I think we can sum it up to two reasons: Trade routes World exploration was sparkled by the need to establish new trade routes, especially to the far east, were spices and other luxury goods were produced. The rise of the Ottoman Empire halted the trade through land (silk road), and forced Europeans to seek new roads to the east. In ancients times, most of the trade was practiced in Mediterranean Sea. The wealthy and powerful nations were spread across its coasts, and used sea routes for commerce. The road to the far east was also wide open. So in short, there was no need, no motive, for them to explore. Technology At this time, there weren't ships that could venture in open oceans like the Atlantic. Most of the ships used for commerce traveled along the coast, rather than in a straight line to their destination. To give a realistic example, Julius Caesar had to capture Gaul ships in order to cross the English Channel during his conquests. His Roman warships weren't able to manage with the waves of the ocean, even for such a small journey. There was also little advancement in navigation. Ancients relied heavily on the night sky and the pole star to find their way. Instruments such as the compass and the mariner's astrolabe, were only used after 13th century AD. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are firm about your dates, that would be the 5th and 6th centuries.And, \u201cEuropeans\u201d were exploring the world at that time.\u201cEuropeans\u201d had been exploring the world since before Agamemnon sailed off to Troy. However, during the 5th and 6th centuries, the Germanic tribes were just beginning to consolidate their \u201cempires\u201d in their \u201cexploration\u201d (conquests) of Europe and what was left of the Roman Empire. It takes a stable government and a willingness to let those people who have new ideas prosper, in order to begin more far reaching explorations.Technology was more often than not hoarded by government; guilds (private companies of craftsmen); and/or religions, in order to keep its advantages to oneself.As various European tribes formed distinct governments and borders, so did their technological exploration skills advance.As their technology was put into action, so did its dissemination propagate.As individual countries became independent of a ruling Empire or the Church, so did their independent thinking in terms of knowledge begin to advance. By the 9th Century, the Norse peoples were exploring the oceans and seas all about Europe and, conquered everything from Scotland to Sicily to Kiev.By the 1200\u2019s, Merchants; European conquers; and explorers such as Marco Polo, were traveling widely to Asia; the Middle East; Africa and most lands that were connected to Europe. When the Ottomans consolidated their Muslim Empire by taking Constantinople in 1453, several things happened.Christian Europe was essentially \u201cat war\u201d with the Muslim Empire which now totally controlled the Trade Routes to the East.New knowledge and ideas were brought to Europe sparking the \u201cRenaissance.\u201dAnd, the so called Christian Reformation began sparking several hundred years of massive bloody warfare in Europe over who had the Favorite Flavor of G-d. Technology exploded. And the need to find new outlets; conquer new lands; finance new wars; etc., also exploded.Hence, the Age of Exploration began. ",
