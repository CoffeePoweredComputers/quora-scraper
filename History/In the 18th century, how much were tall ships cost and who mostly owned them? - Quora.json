            "answer_text": "This is a difficult question to answer since it depended on where the ship was made. However, it is possible to make a few educated guesses. Cost was largely dependent on where the ship was built, but an average of about \u00a320 per ton could be considered average for a fully equipped sailing vessel. A 1100 ton East India merchant ship would thus cost about \u00a322,000.  A smaller vessel, such as the Bounty (ex-Bethia) cost about \u00a34,400.  The costs above are in 18th century \u00a3, so the cost today would be considerably higher with today\u2019s currency values. The Bounty would have cost somewhere around \u00a3600,000 by today\u2019s value, while the East Indiaman would have been a whopping \u00a32.8 million. These prices were obviously beyond the usual capabilities of individuals, and merchant ships were normally built for shipping companies supported by investments from shareholders. Crews were paid a percentage of the value of the sail of cargoes, while investors were paid a percentage based upon the number of shares invested in the company (or in the ship if it was the only vessel operated by the owner). After deducting costs of payment to the builders and routine upkeep, the rest was banked as profit. It was hoped that over a life time of perhaps 20 years, a ship would have paid for itself with enough profit left over to invest in a new vessel when upkeep reached the point of diminishing returns.
