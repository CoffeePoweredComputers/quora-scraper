            "answer_text": "Siberia is a poorly colonized part of Russia. Colony is a bad word in Russian. It assumes an external territory, typically overseas, populated by ethnically different people that you rule against their will and exploit them. Nothing of this applies to Siberia. Which is why no Russian ever calls it a \u201ccolony\u201d\u2014contrary to some foreign researchers, see the link below. With that fact in mind, consider the following: There is no evidence of Slav people living in Siberia and farther east before the first Russian prom\u00edshlenniki arrived here in the XVI century.The native peoples here had no relation to Russia, either ethnically or culturallyThe Chukotka peninsula in the Far East is the place of one of the longest colonial wars in historyThe economic model of the place is distinctly colonial: extraction of natural resources and exporting them raw, or processed, to other parts of Russia and abroad.\u201cSiberia\u201d as a toponym comes from an Asian settlement Sibir. It was the capital of a principality that once formed part of the Mongol-Turkic empire.The modern population of Siberia and Far East are all native Russian speakers, and the absolute majority consider themselves ethnically Russian. No traces of political separatism, or any kind of greater self-determination. China to the south is considered a greater problem than the rule from Moscow. Because of very thin population and weakly developed infrastructure, most of the territories are dependent on transfers from Moscow, and any independence is simply unfeasible. Suggested reading with many interesting details in the book: History of the Peoples of Siberia: Russia's North Asian Colony 1581-1990, by James Forsyth. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, there is a still in discussion. But in the term of international recognition, Siberia, is, indeed, not a Russian colony. It is rather to be a part of Russia following the recognition and the relocation of Russians there. Definitely a bit. The Russian traces might start from an invasion to there in order to seek more lands and expanding for Russia into a future empire. But after the locals accepted the Russian rule, Siberia has officially registered as part of Russia. Is Quebec a Canadian colony? Is California an American colony? Is Texas an American colony? Is Antofagasta a Chilean colony? Is Tasmania an Australian colony? Is Sikkim an Indian colony? Is Manchuria a Chinese colony? You will have to deal with these questions too, but of course, all were recognized by both winning and losing sides as part of the winners. Russia was the winner. Siberia was registered as part of Russia. So that\u2019s an answer ",
