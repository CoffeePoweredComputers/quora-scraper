            "answer_text": "The Life of Domestic Servants in Victorian England As standards of social decorum for the upper classes increased in the later Victorian period, the need for servants in Victorian England increased as well.  Maids of All Work, by John Finnie A Difficult Life for Servants in Victorian England The British census of 1891 found that 1.3 million girls and women worked as domestic servants in Victorian England. They were usually recruited between the ages of 10 and 13, after they had been through some elementary schooling. Many employers hoped for the servants they hired to have at least some elementary literacy and numeracy. It was difficult to get in the 1850s, but by the \u201980s and \u201990s it was becoming a more realistic expectation.  If you went to work for a middle-class family or an upper-class family, you would usually have to go to live in the house where you were working. If you were working for an upper working-class family, it was more likely that you would live at home and simply migrate over every day to do the work. Wherever you were a servant, the hours of labor were very long. The times when you would have to work hardest were often the holidays when everyone else was having the day off, because usually then, Christmas, for example, the family for which you worked would be having a big party or dinner and you would have to work to get it all ready. That is one reason why Boxing Day, the day after Christmas, is a traditional day for giving presents\u2014boxes\u2014to the servants, hence the name. The job had a lot of disadvantages. First, as a servant you were under constant scrutiny; at the same time you were subject to a very rigid form of apartheid. You were living very close to the family, but you were constantly being reminded that you were not a member of it. Most employers felt they had a right to look through their servants\u2019 belongings. It was entirely their purview to go through the servants\u2019 chest of drawers and make sure they hadn\u2019t got anything which the employer objected to. Books of advice for middle-class wives are full of instructions about how you have to keep a very close watch on the servants to make sure that they are acting right. Up to 1860, it was legal to beat your servants without any redress. It was legal to order them to accompany you to church; they sat in the back in a segregated section. Advertisements for servants would specify that they must be Church of England or they must be Presbyterian. Very often columns of advertisements in the papers would say: \u201cNo Irish need apply.\u201d Servants were often told to make themselves as nearly silent and invisible as they possibly could. Life of Alienation for Victorian Servants  Oil painting of a scullery maid by Jean-Sim\u00e9on Chardin It was quite common to have a certain name associated with a certain job. The scullery maid is called Mary. If you hire Gwyneth, you call her Mary because she is the scullery maid. You couldn\u2019t even depend on maintaining your own name for the purposes of your working life. If you were working as a servant in a relatively constrained family that didn\u2019t have much money to spare, you couldn\u2019t even depend on being given enough to eat. There were plenty of stories about servants who were constantly malnourished. It was very common for a family to be only just barely able to afford to spend any service money at all. What they did spend it on would be a servant who would sometimes get the worst of everything. If a servant became sick, you had no job security. You could be turned out by the employer who could be annoyed by the fact that you aren\u2019t available to do the job. If you lived in, you tended to be remote from your own family and friends. Often you would be living in an alien class environment, and employers didn\u2019t want close contacts between the servants and the family. They certainly didn\u2019t want the servant\u2019s family trooping in. And they didn\u2019t really want the servants going off to spend time with their family. Many of them insisted on \u201cno followers,\u201d by which they meant boyfriends. Of course, it would be difficult to prevent an entire category of the population from having boyfriends, especially teenage girls. That encouraged deceit. The girls looked for ways to have some contact with boys, and that would make the employer feel that the servants were untrustworthy, and they\u2019d say, \u201cIt is so hard to get good servants.\u201d It was very common for girls to work in their teens and early twenties, then leave to get married, usually to someone in their own social class. It was relatively less common for women to spend their whole working lives in service, although a fair number did. Being a Servant in Victorian England Had a Bright Side But being a servant did have advantages as well. First, it gave you the chance to live in grand surroundings, far better places to actually pass your working life than you otherwise would ever have. Every working-class person in London was aware of the workhouse as a place you could go if you fell destitute, the constant hazards of falling into prostitution, the enormous number of homeless people, and the fact that even people who were housed lived in conditions of chronic overcrowding\u2014 50,000 London families lived in single rooms in 1890.  Working class life in Victorian Wetherby, West Yorkshire As a servant, you had an attic or shared an attic with another servant. It wouldn\u2019t look like much to us, but to them it was a great thing. If you had a good employer, you could have at least a limited sense of membership in the family. Some families were very good to their servants. In a way, the servants were in the same position as the children. This is the age when children were told that you must be seen but not heard; the servants were in the same situation\u2014excluded from the grown ups\u2019 activities, kept quiet, forced to be obedient and docile. It is a parallel way of life. There are lots of memoirs written by people who grew up in the Victorian era saying how closely they associated with their servants when they were children and how remote they felt from their own parents. Winston Churchill\u2019s book, My Early Life, is a good example of that. He had a nanny whom he was very close to indeed, but he never had any relationship with his parents; they were remote figures who didn\u2019t have very much time for him. Incidentally, having first looked after him, when he got old enough, the nanny went to work for the Attlee family, and looked after young Clement Attlee, who became Prime Minister immediately after Churchill in the late 1940s. Those that Cared for Their Servants  Maid bringing medicine and soup to her master who has a cold If your employer had a good sense of responsibility you would get the benefit of your employer\u2019s protection. Listen to a speech that Prince Albert made to an organization called the Servants\u2019 Provident and Benevolent Society. Who would not feel the deepest interest in the welfare of their domestic servants? Whose heart would fail to sympathize with those who minister to us in sickness, receive us upon our first appearance in this world, and even extend their cares to our mortal remains, who lie under our roof, form our household, and are part of the family? Clearly there was some sense of responsibility to your servants and to take their welfare very seriously. A servant named Elizabeth Gaye died in the 1880s. Her employer looked after the funeral and had her headstone engraved: \u201cIn memory of Elizabeth Gaye, who, after a service of 40 years, finding her strength diminished, with unparalleled disinterestedness, requested that her wages might be proportionately lessened.\u201d It is an incredible story: first, that the family would have all these very long words engraved on the tombstone and, second, that the thing they thought worth singling out to commemorate her entire life was that she had asked for a pay cut because she was aware that she was becoming a little unsteady. link The Life of Domestic Servants in Victorian England from the Lecture Series: Victorian Britain by Professor Patrick Allitt, Ph.D. ",

            "answer_text": "Xander Irons has given an accurate, and honest, assessment of some of the characteristics of a domestic servant\u2019s life. I think, in fairness, some of the positives need to be considered. For many live-in servants some of the key advantages were: several \u2018free\u2019 meals every day (often hot); a room to sleep in that was probably not vermin infested and was most likely weatherproof and may well have been relatively warm (relative to their own homes); regular supplies of clean working clothes and bed linen. In addition, there would have been easy access to clean water supplies and good sanitation (by the standards of the time). After all, a family with servants is unlikely to be living in squalor. When you consider that many of these servants came from families with multiple children (my own mother\u2019s family seem to average between 6 and 12), who would be living in rented houses with one or two bedrooms and a kitchen-living space, water from a polluted communal pump, and similarly communal toilets, a clean middle class house could only have seemed an improvement. And what other jobs were there available for \u2018unskilled\u2019 (ie with no trade skills) young women and sometimes boys ? Factory work: noisy, dirty, often dangerous, long concentrated hours of work and often not available relatively close to home, a variety of manual labouring in agriculture, prostitution, becoming a wife (and inevitably) mother. Having said that, I would imagine that the key determinant for the quality of life for the average servant was the character of the family they were living with. I am sure there were many kind, compassionate families where servants were valued and treated well, I am equally sure that there were houses that were hellholes, but how long would the servants stay ?
