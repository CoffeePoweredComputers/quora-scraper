            "answer_text": "Whatever you want to offer her just offer her with true devotion, love and imagine that I am offering it to my mother and feel that love , believe me no matter how bad it tastes, no matter how stale (basi) it is she will accept it with more than the love you offered it to her. But still if you want to know what she loves to eat then according to Shri Lalita Sahsranamam . She is called madhupriya ( the one who loves honey) , payasannpriya ( the one who loves pudding or kheer) , guddannpritmansa ( the one who loves food made from jaggery or gud). She also loves a Bengali sweet dish called Shondesh. To know more about her favourite dishes u can read Shrimad Devi Bhagvat, Devi puja varnan . There is has been described what to offer to goddess on each day , on each tithi. But make sure offer everything with pure devotion and true love at her lotus feet.  Maa Meenakshi made by me.

In South Indian temples, Durga Puja is done for nine days ( Navratri) and on each day, Goddess is decorated with Her Avatar attire and different naivedyams are offered daily. Goddess Balatripura Sundari, the naivedyam offered is sweet pongal. 2. Goddess Annapurna devi is offered Tamarind or lemon rice.  3. Goddess Gayatri Devi is offeted coconut rice or payasam.  4. Goddess Mahalakshmi is offered minapa_garelu, snack prepared from urad dal batter  5. Goddess Saraswati Devi is offered curd rice.  6. Goddess Sri Lalitha devi's naivedyam is Kesari sweet.  7.
