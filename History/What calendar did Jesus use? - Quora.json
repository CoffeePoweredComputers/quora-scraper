            "answer_text": "Jesus used the calendar that the Jews and many other nations used at that time. It was based on the cycles of the moon not the sun. The lunar cycle is shorter than the solar cycle Generally there was 12 months of 28 or 29 days in the year, but there was a 19 year cycle where every 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th year an extra moth was added to keep up with the seasons They measure the years according the reigns of kings. They did not use BC or BCE or AD or CE as is commonly used today. Orthodox Modern Jews use a different calendar numbering system. According to tradition, the Hebrew calendar started at the date calculated to be the year of creation so the current (2019/2020) Hebrew year is said to be 5780. ",
