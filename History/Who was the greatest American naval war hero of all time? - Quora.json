            "answer_text": "For me the greatest American naval hero has to be the Union Admiral David Farragut (1801\u20131870).  In Farragut\u2019s case, I\u2019m thinking not only of his great personal courage, but also of his tactical and strategic insight and his great moral courage. He had the nerve to plan, undertake, and personally lead two of the most dangerous and successful nautical undertakings of the American Civil War, in each case leading to a decisive and indispensable Union victory. The first of these victories was the Capture of New Orleans, which fell to Farragut\u2019s fleet in April 1962 after Farragut broke through a powerful\u2014and some thought invincible\u2014ring of Confederate fortifications and defensive vessels. The capture of New Orleans was among the most decisive Union victories of the Civil War, since it closed the South\u2019s largest port and center of trade to the Confederacy\u2014and opened it to the Union. This capture was also the first step toward the Union\u2019s achievement of total control of the Mississippi with the fall of Vicksburg in July 1863. Below we see a dramatic depiction of Farragut\u2019s flagship, the USS Hartford, forcing its way past Fort Jackson and the feared Confederate ironclad ram Manassas. 2. The second of these victories was Farragut\u2019s success at the Battle of Mobile Bay. In 1864, the Confederacy\u2019s last major port on the Caribbean was at Mobile, Alabama. Mobile Bay was protected by a trio of powerful forts, mounting heavy cannon, as well as by an extensive field of tethered naval mines (then called \u201ctorpedoes\u201d) controlling all but a narrow passage in the one navigable channel, which ran past Fort Morgan, the Bay\u2019s largest fortress. To be clear: in order to enter the Bay, Farragut\u2019s fleet of mostly wooden ships would have to steam through a narrow thread of water with the massive Fort Morgan on one side and that minefield of floating, tethered torpedoes on the other. Once past the Fort Morgan, Farragut\u2019s fleet would face the heavily armored, if slow moving, Confederate ironclad Tennessee. Again, a dramatic painting sets the scene:  Farragut had himself lashed high in the rigging on the mast of his flagship, the Hartford. When his lead ironclad, the Tecumseh (just beginning to heel over in the picture above) hit a torpedo and sank with almost all hands, the following ships began to mill around and falter\u2014leaving them as easy targets for Fort Morgan\u2019s guns. From his perch in the rigging, Farragut called down to his staff on the Hartford with the words \"Damn the torpedoes! Four bells. Captain Drayton, go ahead! Jouett, full speed!\" These words have been shortened in common parlance to the popular saying: \u201cDamn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead.\u201d Farragut\u2019s exploits, and his way with words, made for a great recruiting poster.  Despite taking many hits from the guns on Fort Morgan, Farragut\u2019s Hartford and the balance of his fleet succeeded in penetrating Mobile Bay and subduing the ironclad Tennessee. Later, Farragut\u2019s navy, with the aid of amphibious infantry who approached the fortress from the landward side, combined to compel the surrender of Fort Morgan\u2014and, as of August 1864, Mobile Bay was in Union hands. Thanks to Farragut\u2019s careful planning, willingness to accept risk, and courageous personal leadership, the Union navy won two of its most important victories of the Civil War. I think America\u2019s greatest Admiral was Chester W. Nimitz, whose performance in the Pacific during WWII was spectacular. But America\u2019s greatest naval hero was David Farragut. ",

            "answer_text": "At first that would be given to John Paul Jones. Who gave the naval battle cry \u201cI have not yet begun to fight.\u201d But for me it has to be Raymond Ames Spruance. He was basically thrown into command of Admiral Hulsey\u2019s carrier fleet. Never in command of a fleet that size(carrier-air combat). He commanded four heavy cruisers and support ships at the time Hulsey recommended him to Admiral Nimitz. That put him in charge of Task Force 16 which included \u201cUSS Enterprise and USS Hornet.\u201d The \u201cYorktown\u201d under Jack Fletcher also included in this battle. In the battle for \u201cMidway\u201d ,through his command leadership the US Navy sank all 4 Japanese carriers. Losing only the \u201cYorktown.\u201d But that in itself being important the most important thing that occurred was this put and end to the Japanese Naval (IJN) threat to the Pacific. Helping put the US on a path to victory. By stopping them at Midway, gave time for the US to catch up with building of ships and supplies. Spruance is to me the \u201cgreatestAmerican naval war hero.
