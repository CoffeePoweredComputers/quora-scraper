            "answer_text": "It's actually quite simple; when the US defeated the Empire of Japan, we didn't remove Emperor Hirohito or his title but rather changed the Constitution of Japan to basically diminish any power he has. It is explicitly stated in Article 1: \u201cThe Emperor is the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people.\u201d Reason we didn't remove the Emperor, mind you he was considered a war-criminal, was because he added legitimacy to the US military dictatorship established after Japan was defeated. The Emperor, a man who was glorified in Japan but rarely seen was reduced to appearing someone inferior to the American\u2019s in this image:  General MacArthur and Hirohito. So in short, the Emperor lost power due to the American occupation of Japan, but we kept the Emperor in place to add legitimacy to our rule for he was respected by the Japanese people. ",

            "answer_text": "A better question would be \u201cWHEN did the Japanese Emperors lose power?\u201d. In many ways, the Japanese Emperors still have the same power that they had before WWII (and the same power that the British monarch also has). In some ways the Japanese Emperors still have more power than the President of the United States of America does (Consider the difference in reaction should the President of the United States of America were to tell an American General that they had acted disgracefully and had brought shame onto America and if the Emperor of Japan were to tell a Japanese General that they had acted disgracefully and had brought shame onto Japan.) At the national level \u201cpower\u201d can have many meanings. PS - The Japanese snookered General MacArthur and he ended up running Japan after WWII with the \u201cassistance\u201d of the same people/class that had been running Japan before/during WWII and they had absolutely no desire to be \u201cacting in America\u2019s best interest\u201d.
