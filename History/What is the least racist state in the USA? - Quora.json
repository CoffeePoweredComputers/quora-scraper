            "answer_text": "Someone made a Hate Map of where racist tweets come from (as a proportion of total tweets). It didn't actually rank the states, but it looks like Utah, Arizona, Wyoming, Montana, Nevada, and Oregon have the least racism in their Tweets. That might mean they're the least racist states, or it might mean their racists just don't use twitter. Another Twitter analysis specifically watched for racist reactions to Obama's reelection in 2012. According to that analysis, the least racist state was Michigan, followed by Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Maine, and Washington. It's worth noting that no state was in top five of both lists and some, like Utah*, were at opposite ends of the list depending on which analysis you look to. This suggests that we don't really know how to measure the racism of entire state populations in any objective way. According to FBI statistics, the states with the fewest reported hate crimes per capita are  \t \t \t\t \t\t\tLouisiana, \t\t \t\t \t\t\tIowa, \t\t \t\t \t\t\tGeorgia, \t\t \t\t \t\t\tPennsylvania, and Wyoming. However, that doesn't measure which hate crimes are race-based (rather than about religion or sexual orientation or whatever), doesn't account for differences in local law, and doesn't account for hate crimes that are not reported to law enforcement. Wyoming is the only state to be listed more than once, so I hereby award it the gold medal for Least Racist State As Far As I Can Tell. UPDATE: I found another source on racism, this time a study that found a correlation between the frequency of Google search results containing the \"N-word\" and \"the all-cause Black mortality rate, [and] also Black-White disparities in mortality.\" This is probably the best (most objective) measure of racism so far, although it only detects racism against blacks.   Source: Association between an Internet-Based Measure of Area Racism and Black Mortality,  Published: April 24, 2015 Wyoming looks pretty good for the third time, so it keeps it's title as Least Racist State As Far As I Can Tell. FOOTNOTE:* Utah is among the least racist states according to several sources, but one of the most racist when measured by the Twitter response to Obama's election. This is probably because Utahns don't generally hate blacks but they do hate when Democrats win federal elections. Consider that Bill Clinton came in 3rd in the Utah popular vote for President in 1996 (even behind third-party candidate Ross Perot) , whereas Mia Love, black Republican from Utah, is immensely popular with the public, the press, and voters alike.

            "answer_text": "I am Canadian and I have been to 35+ states in the Union, and the one I find the least racist is Texas, then Hawaii. Hawaii I have heard is very good and has ranked high in many polls & research, but since I have never been there myself, they drop behind the one I have personally experienced to have nest to no racism, including a very well mixed population of Asian, Black, Latino & White. What most of the other answers get wrong is they only test for one kind of racism, hatred of Blacks, but that isn\u2019t the only kind of bigotry I have seen throughout the US. and definitely not the most toxic kind of racism. There is hatred of Whites, hatred of Jews, hatred of Latinos and hatred of Asians. To only test by hatred of Blacks shows that you have some form of bigotry yourself. In Texas, they just expect you to pick yourself up, dust yourself off and work harder or smarter. All states I have been to, have a bias of some sort, and theirs is more right of center, Libertarian Culture. Be a responsible adult person, respect others and put in a full day\u2019s work. Last time I went there we had a very diverse group and nobody had any problems, just none at all. We went to about 4 cities, two of their biggest, and there was far less tension and hatred going on in those cities. After going to LA, NY and Chi, I was surprised they didn\u2019t have the seething hatred and racism of those other big cities. I don\u2019t care which group hates which group, Whites hating blacks, blacks hating whites, its all racism/bigotry. My next picks, in order, would be Hawaii, Colorado, Utah, Maine, Nevada or Michigan. The bottom of the list, as I have experienced it, would be: California, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Indiana, Maryland, DC, Georgia, Florida & Washington. And if you want to go by history, then California is the worst. After Slavery was abolished, then created laws to make Asians non-human chattel that could be killed by blacks and whites without repercussions. Not to mention they spearheaded the incarceration of all Japanese citizens during WW2. So after all the enlightenment of Emancipation Proclamation in 1862, Californians found a whole new race to treat as non/sub-human. I think that makes them the winner of the title worst. Everyone has their own experiences and have different metrics for their individual judgments. You can probably go online and find numerous charts and graphs that support certain states that support the political bent of the person putting it together and the selection of Data and sources they use.
