            "answer_text": "I have written about this several times on Quora, but it was an epic moment in the history of Britain, and I suppose that as I am now rapidly becoming one of the few people who witnessed it at first hand, it can bear retelling. It was the never to be forgotten Battle of Britain in 1940. I was nearly 8 years old, so saw it from a child\u2019s perspective. Living as we did in a little cottage on the edge of Biggin Hill Fighter Station, an airfield in Kent, we were in the midst of it. I didn\u2019t know at the time, how grave the situation was, and that we in Britain were badly outnumbered and fighting desperately to keep our freedom and our way of life. I remember so well that it was a beautiful summer, and I would watch the planes (Hurricanes to start with, then we got Spitfires) wheeling and diving, silhouetted against a pure blue sky. Some of the time, of course, I was in either our Anderson shelter which my father had erected in our back garden or my school\u2019s brick built shelter. This, however, didn\u2019t stop the children of our small hamlet, from seizing every opportunity to watch the airborne battles, usually in the far distance, but occasionally it seemed, almost overhead. We would see our planes returning and doing a victory roll over the fields and hedges as they approached the airfield. How we would dance up and down, waving and cheering. Unmindful that men had perished out there in the blue haze of the summer skies. The victory rolls were put a stop to, as a couple of planes actually clipped the hedges! We would count the planes going out and coming in. If there was one sadly missing, we would run to the main gate of the airfield and ask the guard, who knew us well, who was missing, and what had happened. We more or less always got the same answer, \u201cOh, he\u2019s OK, he ditched in the Channel. The Air/Sea rescue boys have got him\u201d, or, \u201cHe\u2019s OK he\u2019s landed at Manston or Hawkinge.\u201d Oh that\u2019s all right then, we would think, not realising that these were kindly lies, and that young pilot probably wouldn\u2019t be landing anywhere anymore! I remember also the occasional parachute floating down (very rarely this) and, if in the nearby fields or woods, we would be sent by our mothers to try and get some of the parachute silk with which to make clothes - knickers and slips mostly. My mother didn\u2019t approve, but I would run with the rest of the village children. I was never lucky. The big boys could run faster! I do recall seeing one day, that it wasn\u2019t one of our boys who had come down on the \u2018chute, but an enemy pilot. I watched him being led away by our local bobby and the army lads coming to get him. I\u2019ll never forget his face. He was terrified, and he was only about the age of some of our big boys! I also remember very distinctly the scarred faces of some of the young fighter pilots whose planes had burned around them before they could parachute out. It wasn\u2019t so much scars, as their faces were like egg shells - smooth. Their hair had gone and their noses and lips. They were being treated at East Grinstead hospital by, I learned much later, the famous plastic surgeon, Sir Archie McIndoe. They came back to visit their comrades at Biggin. We had an assembly at School, when the headmistress told us about these brave young men. She said not to run away, but if addressed, to say \u201cGood morning\u201d politely, and, above all, not to stare. My mother and I were in the village shop once, when one badly burned young man, still in his pilot\u2019s uniform came in. My mother and the shopkeeper (whose name I can\u2019t recall) chatted to him, but on the way home, my mother was unusually silent, and when I started to ask her about him, said, \u201cPlease be quiet\u201d which she never said to me, always being willing to answer my many questions. Those were undoubtedly very difficult times indeed, but, of course, as a child, I had no idea of the seriousness of the situation, and that the RAF was trying to prevent the German Luftwaffe gaining air superiority over the English Channel, in order to invade us. My father sat me down one evening and explained it to me, but, I\u2019m afraid, I was too busy enjoying that gorgeous summer, playing in the fields and woods with my friends. It was our last bit of carefree play really, that July and August, as in September, as we returned to school, holidays over, the London Blitz would start, and we were in direct line of the enemy bombers that would soon be noisily darkening our skies. We would find ourselves confined to the village, and more or less living in the air raid shelters for many months ahead. I\u2019m glad though that I actually lived through that - the Battle of Britain, undoubtedly an epic moment in our country\u2019s history. ",

            "answer_text": "After taking a M.Sc. degree in 1982\u201383, my first job was with Acorn Computer in Cambridge UK, a smallish company with a home computer based on the 6502 microprocessor, a bit like the Apple II. Steve Furber and Sophie Wilson started looking at the next generation of microprocessors to build a better computer, and found that while the various 16bit microprocessors (Motorola 68000, Intel 8086, NatSemi 32016) were faster, they achieved that in part by having more registers, and those registers had to be saved to memory on an interrupt - so the interrupt latency was worse. That was going to be a big problem for their style of low-cost computer system, which relied on putting a lot of functionality into interrupt-driven software rather than expensive hardware. So they took the unreasonable decision to design their own microprocessor (and 3 other chips - MEMC memory-controller, VIDC video-controller, IOC io-controller). The outcome was the ARM-1 microprocessor. It skipped straight from an 8bit data bus to a 32bit data bus, optimized to get as much bandwidth as possible out of the nibble-mode DRAM chips of the time, which could do up to 4 sequential accesses very quickly. The processor core was remarkably simple - about 24K transistors IIRC and very very fast. And - crucially - it turned out to use very little power. That wasn\u2019t an original design goal, it was just a side-effect of making a chip with few transistors that could get a lot of work done in just a few cycles. But it caught the attention of Apple, who were working on battery-powered handheld devices. And eventually low-power ARM processors made their way into just about everything - almost all cellphones, many embedded devices, and the total number of ARM cores in chips made every years is up in the billions. I just bought myself a couple of little Maple Mini computer boards - that was about $6 for a board with a 72MHz ARM processor (but you can get them in volume for under $3). I didn\u2019t work on the project myself, but I sat just across the hallway from the chip-design team with their fancy workstations, and got to see some of the very first ARM-based processor boards when the first silicon arrived. And got to work with an ARM board when there were maybe 100 of them in the world, rather than tens or hundreds of billions. Crazy huh ? ",
