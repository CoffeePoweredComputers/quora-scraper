            "answer_text": "An interesting question., though I\u2019ve never looked through the material at the archives site, one particular piece of \u201cevidence\u201d used to frame the wrongly accused stood out like a bright orange utility vest or road cone.. According to the archive records the following image was found in Mr. Oswald\u2019s shirt pocket hours after his arrest \u2192  *National Archives image Note the pristine condition of this \u201cevidence\u201d. Lest we forget, remember this pristine piece of mere paper was supposedly found in Mr. Oswald\u2019s shirt pocket hours after his arrest. The major problem here is during his arrest Mr. Oswald\u2019s shirt was ripped, tugged, pulled this way & that way in a fierce physical struggle with multiple police \u2014-> Hill and another officer first ran to the theater balcony to turn on some lights as other officers converged on the scene. He kicked open some fire doors and another officer told the projectionist to turn on the lights. Hill said as he ran downstairs he could hear shouting and when he entered the seating area he found officers struggling with a man near the back of the theater and we managed to subdue the prisoner Somehow in their haste to frame the wrongly accused amid a hastily contrived script to follow, the parties involved forgot to bend, rip, and/or at the very least tear the planted evidence. The following image displays Mr. Oswald in his mangled shirt tugged, pulled apart \u2014\u2192  Mere paper wouldn\u2019t have withstood the obvious intense physical struggle described in italics above. For the record, there are many Americans and astutely keen people around the world who aren\u2019t so called conspiracy theorist\u2026just spare us the hastily contrived script to frame an innocent party. Where we come from IF the planted \u201cevidence\u201d after the physical struggle was indeed in his shirt pocket during that intense fight, that ripped his shirt wide open to expose his white t-shirt underneath it wouldn't be in pristine undisturbed condition.
