            "answer_text": "Well, the Nazis considered Eastern Europeans to belong to inferior races, inferior in various ways, including even morality. But they did not necessarily hate them, Sure, some Nazis did hate them, But I guess, of all people, the Nazis had the most hatred for Jews and the Roma, they considered both to be very evil, even criminal , races. So that finally led to; the Nazi genocide of the Jews and the Roma. Horrible. Well, all genocides are horrible crimes of mass murder, caused by hatred. There were other genocides like that during WWII. Including the genocide organized by the government of Croatia, to try to kill all the Serbs in Croatia. Or the genocide organized by an Ukrainian army which tried to achieve the independence of Ukraine, the leaders of the army decided to kill all the Polish people, who lived in what is now western Ukraine, which was before the war, part of Poland. They believed all the Polish people are evil, so deserve to die. This prejudiced, hateful belief, was the result of the Polish government before the war, treating its Ukrainian minority just terribly, So some Ukrainians came to believe as a result, that all Poles are evil. So that led to the genocide against the Poles, in that region, by that Ukrainian army. ",

Ironically, the Jews were as well. and yet theis \u2018inferior race\u2019 was apparently able to start a worldwide Bolshevik-Capitalist conspiracy to take over the world. Go figure. But then, it\u2019s pointless to expect logic in an ideology like Fascism. ",
