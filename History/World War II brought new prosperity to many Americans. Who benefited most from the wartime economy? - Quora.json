            "answer_text": "Several years of the Great Depression, and four years of war. The US was ready to cut loose. My old office mate got back in Dec 1945 and partied for a month, then went to see his old HS principal to get his diploma. This had been anticipated since he and others had dropped out. For example \u201cthis war will be over before I get into it\u201d. He enlisted in the Navy at age 16. His father could not refuse since he was under-age when he ran off and enlisted in Army in WW1. He got credit for some service assignment, and went back to class for one semester to catch up. Had to wear khaki's since that was the only spare clothing for sale, but he made it. GI bill paid his way and for 20% of all vets. GI loans for home, farm and business also boomed. Also the stipend for GI unemployed, though that was an average of only 4 months. They were ready to work, the girls after four years with few men, ready to marry. Tremendous optimism and ready to go. ",
