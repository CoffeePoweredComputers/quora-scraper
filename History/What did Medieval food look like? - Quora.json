            "answer_text": "As Mr Zawadzki has already noted, the food would have varied depending on region because, in the absence of refrigeration and rapid transport, most food had to be grown locally. Naturally, spices, dried fruits and processed products such as sugar, could be transported even in the Middle Ages, but anything from far away usually commanded a premium price. Nothing with origins in the \u201cNew World\u201d would have found its way onto the medieval dinning table, so in addition to the potatoes and turkey mentioned below, corn (maize), tomatoes, and other foodstuffs did not exist. On the other hand, there was more game such as venison, wild-boar, pheasant, beaver (could be eaten on fast days because it had scales). In addition, food such as pigeons (doves) and swans, which we no longer consume, were part of the diet. My personal expertise is the crusader states. The cuisine here benefited from the fact that these states were located in one of the most fertile regions of the world. (No, the Kingdom of Jerusalem was not located in the North African desert used to film The Kingdom of Heaven, but rather occupied the biblical \u201cland of milk and honey.\u201d ) Furthermore, the crusader states sat at a cross-roads of civilizations, which ensured a variety of culinary traditions lived side-by-side \u2015 and very likely influenced one another. On the one hand the inhabitants of \"Outremer\" inherited the cooking habits of earlier Mediterranean civilizations including invaders from the Arabian peninsula and the Near Eastern steppes, while on the other hand they also enjoyed the customs brought out to the Holy Land by Latin settlers from Northern and Western Europe.
