            "answer_text": "Who was worst vice president of all time: I can\u2019t answer worst vice-president of all time, but in my lifetime, I would nominate Spiro T. Agnew. In 1968, Richard M. Nixon was elected President and Spiro Agnew was elected as the 39th Vice President (VP) of the United States. The 1968 Nixon/Agnew campaign was based on bringing \u201cLaw and Order\u201d back to the country. They were reelected in 1972. Less than a year before Nixon\u2019s resignation as president, Agnew became the first U.S. vice president to resign in disgrace. Prior to the 1968 campaign, and unknown to the Nixon team, Agnew, as Baltimore\u2019s County Executive and later as Governor of Maryland, was taking kickbacks (think bribes) from contractors. The U.S. Justice Department uncovered this widespread evidence of political corruption, including allegations that his practice of accepting bribes continued even as vice president. After months of maintaining his innocence, Agnew pleaded \u201cno contest\u201d to a single felony charge of tax evasion in exchange for the dropping of charges of political corruption. He was subsequently fined $10,000, sentenced to three years probation, and disbarred by the Maryland court of appeals and required to resigne from office. Nixon replaced him with House Republican leader Gerald Ford. He is the second VP to resign the position, the other being John C. Calhoun in 1832. Unlike Calhoun, Agnew resigned as a result of a scandal. ",
