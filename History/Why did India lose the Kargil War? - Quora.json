            "answer_text": "Technically Kargil was not a war. It was a conflict of a greater proportion than usual. It was initiated by the Pakistani militants(trained Pak soldiers actually). Indian objective was simple. Recapture the land it lost to the mujahedeen. But the job proved to be way more difficult than initially thought. The number of infiltrators was more than Indian estimates. And they had the tactical advantage. So the Indian side suffered more casualties. But the objectives were completed. All infiltrators retreated or were neutralised. So India won the conflict and paid the price in lives. So in the end it all depends on how you choose to see it. Peace.. ",
