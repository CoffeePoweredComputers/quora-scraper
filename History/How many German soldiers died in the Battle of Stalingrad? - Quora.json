            "answer_text": "This question itself poses a separate question. This is the question of what constitutes the definition of the Battle of StalinGrad. Do you mean only the fighting within the city of Stalingrad, or do you mean the campaigns of Army Group B from late 1942 up to the capture of Rostov in February 1943? Either, or a combination of the two, are themselves problems of definition. Also, it is, in my humble opinion (IMHO) a mistake to view Army Group B's activities in isolation from both the concurrent battles of Army Group Centre and Army Group A. I will edit and extend this answer tomorrow when I have access to my desktop computer. ",
