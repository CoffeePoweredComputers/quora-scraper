            "answer_text": "The attitude that prevailed in Qing China after the Opium Wars essentially said\u201cif you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, join \u2018em\u201d and decided to start growing and selling Opium domestically. History of opium in China Once the turmoil caused by the mid-century Taiping Rebellion died down, the economy came to depend on opium to play several roles. Merchants found the substance useful as a substitute for cash, as it was readily accepted in the interior provinces such as Sichuan and Yunnan while the drug weighed less than the equivalent amount of copper. Since poppies could be grown in almost any soil or weather, cultivation quickly spread. Local officials could then meet their tax quotas by relying on poppy growers even in areas where other crops had not recovered. Although the government continued to require suppression, local officials often merely went through the motions both because of bribery and because they wanted to avoid antagonizing local farmers who depended on this lucrative crop. One official complained that when people heard a government inspector was coming, they would merely pull up a few poppy stalks to spread by the side of the road to give the appearance of complying. A provincial governor observed that opium, once regarded as a poison, was now treated in the same way as tea or rice. By the 1880s, even governors who had initially suppressed opium smoking and poppy production now depended on opium taxes. [edited for formatting] The Qing (central) government did not care for this and tried to suppress it, but by this point it was widespread and had corrupted most of the society, making enforcement nearly impossible. Ironically however, domestic production harmed Great Britain\u2019s position in the trade. Wikipedia says that eventually opium production began to fall in China after concerted diplomatic and international effort, but given the fraud government officials perpetrated to hide the extent of opium production\u2026 this is difficult to verify I think. Of course once the Qing collapsed that all went out the window. China wouldn\u2019t get its opium problem under control until the CCP took over. ",

            "answer_text": "It didn't that's why their was a civil war between the communists and nationalists (KMT). China at that point was by all definitions a failed state. The Qing Dynasty had nominal power and authority, but the real power laid with regional warlords and European powers who carved China into spheres of influences. That is how Hong Kong became a British colony. It was taken by the British empire on lease after the Qing Dynasty's lost the Opium Wars. Years of stagnation left the Qing Dynasty in shambles. Its governance system was corrupt and its military was subpar when compared to the modern steamboats of the European empires. Similar to the Ottoman Empire, the Qing Dynasty regressed instead of progressed and actively fought against modernization. The subsequent collapse led to pure anarchy and the rise of nationalist movements, which spawned the communists and KMT. The communists eventually won the civil war because they had the support of the poor who vastly outnumbered the wealthy who supported the KMT. The communists had much support the further inland one went in China and Mao received support from the people during World War II against the Japanese and the civil war that followed. The KMT stuck along the coast and garnered support from the wealthier city dwellers and land owners. The conditions turned the conflict effectively into one between classes. The communists represented the poor, while the KMT represented the rich. It was your standard Marxist class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoise. Fortunately, for Mao there were many more poor people in China than rich and had the popular support thereby legitimizing their revolutionary goals. The KMT, under the leadership of Chiang Kai-Shek, was mired with blatant displays of corruption. He presented himself as your typical dictator, dressed in military attire and hoarded US aid given to him to fight the Japanese and the communists. He rather enrich himself and his supporters than support the common folk. When the KMT lost they fled to Taiwan, which was easy since they were largely concentrated along China's coast where the wealthier cities were. The communist cemented their reign on the mainland, while the KMT garnered Western sympathy as a government in exile and was considered the legitimate sovereigns of China. Taiwan held the security council seat for China as the ROC (Republic of China) versus the mainland who differentiated themselves as the PRC (People's Republic of China). Diplomatic relations with the PRC were immediately cut by Western powers and the PRC mirrored North Korea under Mao Zedong's disastrous rule. It was not until Deng Xiaoping took over and killed the old guard was he able to begin modernizing efforts that contradicted the values instilled during the cultural revolution. Instead, the party ideology became \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics.\u201d Deng welcomed Western businesses to China where manafucturing was cheap and there were billions of people eager to work for pennies on the dollar. Full diplomatic relations were restored when US President Nixon visited China. As a mutual show of trust, Nixon delegitimized the KMT and Taiwan by giving the security council seat back to the PRC. This signaled to the world that the CCP (Chinese communist party) were the sole legitimate government. Taiwan was relegated to observer status in the UN as a result. Deng promised to set up SEZ (Special economic zones) along the coast in areas like Shenzhen, Guandong, and Shanghai where capitalism could flourish without much government oversight. US businesses began moving manufacturing to the mainland to reduce costs and increase profits. This led to the rise of fast fashion, where cheap disposable clothing could be mass produced for sale in department stores, malls, and mail order catalogs. American companies also sought to sell American industrial equipment to the Chinese. The Chinese were studious and copied the industrial equipment instead of buying them. Saving them from being dependent on Western technology. This earned the Chinese the stereotype as tech stealers and copycats. The rest is, as they say, history. ",
