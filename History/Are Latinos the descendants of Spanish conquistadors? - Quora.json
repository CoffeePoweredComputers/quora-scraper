            "answer_text": "A great amount of them are. Ohters descend of Spanish colonizers, other of Spanish immigrants, others, a great lot, of indigenous Americans, and most of different mixes between African slaves, European immigrants, indigenous inhabitants. The result is a numerous set of racial types and cultural traits that revolve around the usage of Spanish and the Christian religion that does not have the characteristics of a race, nor of a single culture. And trying to label it simply as \u201cLatino\u201d is as over simplifying that could be considered stupid if it were not just an excuse to label some sector of the population as \u201cnon-white\u201d, which for me is the only purpose behind it.

            "answer_text": "Latin Americans are the result of five centuries of racial mixing! The majority are a highly variable mixture of Spanish and/or Portuguese (or other European ancestry) and Native American or Black. Some, especially in the Caribbean and Brazil, are a mixture of all three. Not all Latinos have the same mix however and many are mostly indigenous or black with little to no European ancestry at all, while others have substantial European ancestry and a relatively small percentage are of fully European descent. White Latinos are usually the privileged, upper-class in Latin American society. Whilst the mixed Latinos tend to be less privileged (based on their racial mix) and the fully indigenous or black Latinos are usually the poorest and most oppressed of all! ",
