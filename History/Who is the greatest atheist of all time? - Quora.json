            "answer_text": "There is no point to proclaim oneself the greatest atheist who does not depend on donations or support to survive unlike the greatest religious this or that. Mindsets are very difficult to deprogram and so are superstitions. Any atheist who tries to convince the truth and reality will be scorned or shunned most of the time. Inevitably, hypocrite political leaders who themselves are atheists privately, but for the sake of self-agenda to gain all-round support in order to gain power, cunningly exploited and manipulated the reality on the ground. As a result, history had shown us repeatedly that political leaders who trumpeted to be devoutly religious but discovered too late that they committed scandalous sins after sins during their rule. So were the religious elites that were uncovered. ",

            "answer_text": "Rick Thorne makes a good point. And I like his choice. It\u2019s an ambiguous question. Is it asking a question similar to, Who is the greatest person who happens to be an American? Or who is the greatest person at being an American? Even Sagan was first and foremost a science and science explainer. Atheist is merely a label that\u2019s applied to people who answer, \u201cNo,\u201d when asked, \u201cDo you believe in gods?\u201d Atheist isn\u2019t what someone is. It\u2019s what someone is not.
