            "answer_text": "How did the Silk Road begin ?  Silk road was a trade route between china and europe. As you can see from it\u2019s name, the trade was mostly related to Silk. Silk was considered luxury at that time since the chinese kept the silk production process secret. The chinese monopoly on silk and europe great demand made the route flourish. The route/road it self was closed and opened several time. The first one it was closed because Tibet took it from 678\u2013699. The Tang dynasty however retook it and open the route again under empress wu on 699. Later it was closed again by the ottoman after they captured constantinople. why did it end?  It is ended because the ottoman empire closed it after the fall of Constantinople. The ottoman hated the western europe so they implemented embargo on europe by closing the route. But at that time the silk road was not as great as it was once. Europe finally manage to get the hold on the silk secret so the chinese lost its monopoly. The Mongol also started to decline. The route it self passed through many region and these region started to disintegrated. Europe itself was trying to find another route after the ottoman closed it, and so the Silk road lose its importance and cease to exist. Did it really end? Xi Jinping in 2014 introduced a new plan about the NEW SILK ROAD that will connecting China and Europe. ",
