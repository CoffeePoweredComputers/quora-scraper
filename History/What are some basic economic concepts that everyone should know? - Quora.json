            "answer_text": "Since I am unable to speculate the purpose for which you are asking, I will assume you as two persons 1) As a layman 2) As a rookie Investor. Basic concepts to be known for a layman - 1) Central problem/Basic question of an economy - The central problem of an economy is common for all types of an economy. They are A) What to produce and in how much quantity? For example assume two commodities Food and Military equipment. Whether should we produce more quantity of food and lees quantity of Military equipments or vice versa. B) How to produce these commodities ? Should we use Labour incentive i.e using more labour or Capital incentive i.e using more capital goods such as Machinery to produce a commodity. C) For whom to produce? Should we produce Luxury goods for the few rich or basic goods for the many poor. 2) Economic system - Economic system refers to a way of answering these basic questions, different economic system have different views and methods to solve these problem. There four basic economic systems. A) Traditional economic system - Solving the basic question through traditions and customs, its nonexistent in the modern world it is also known as subsistence economy. B) Capitalist economic system - Solving the basic question by the forces of Market forces ie Demand, supply and price, here the role of government is often confined to Law and order, maintenance of the monetary system, foreign policy and etc. C) Socialistic economic system - Here the basic question are solved by the government through centralized planning. Private ownership is limited thus there is a non existent private sector. D) Mixed economy - In a mixed economy both the private and the public sector coexist. The basic questions are solved by both of them. 3) Utility - Utility refers to the satisfaction power of an commodity. Its in a psychological factor and cannot be measured in terms of money. 4) Barter system - This type of system existed predominantly before the introduction of money. In this system goods are exchanged for goods. This worked well during the earlier period of humanity since our want were limited but later on when our wants increased the problem of barter was revealed. The system of suffered from lot of drawbacks such as lack of coincidence of want ie assume two persons A and B, A want wheat for which he is willing to exchange Rice with B, B should not only have wheat but also should have a want for rice. It was difficult to measure the value of an commodity in an barter system. There are many more disadvantages. 5) Tax - Tax is a financial charge imposed on the tax payer by the state, failure to pay is punishable by law. There are different types of taxes.A) Direct and Indirect tax.B) Specific and Ad voleram taxC) VATD) Single and multiple tax 6) Fiat money - Fiat money is the currency the government as approved to be used as legal tender which is not backed by any physical commodity, the value of the fiat money is based on the relationship between demand and supply. 7) Inflation, Deflation, Stagflation - A) Inflation - Inflation refers to a situation where there is rise in the price of the general commodities over a period of time. There are two causes of inflation they are a) Cost push Inflation - When the price of a commodity increases due to increase in the price of the factor used to produce the commodity it is called cost push inflation. b) Demand pull Inflation - when the supply for an commodity is lesser than its demand, the price of the commodity increases to reduce the demand this is called as demand pull inflation . B) Deflation - Deflation is a situation in which there is a fall in the general price of an commodity over a period of time. C) Stagflation - stagflation is a situation in which there is lack of demand and stagnation on one hand and inflation on the other hand. 8) Black market and Grey market- A) Black market - Black market is a place where illegal transactions take place it is a clandestine market. The proceeds earned from the black market is called black money. B) Grey Market - Grey market is also a parallel market. It is a market where goods at sold and bought outside the manufacturer authorized channels. Unlike black market the channel's involved in grey market is legal. 9) Monetary policy - Monetary policy is a process used by the Central bank of a country to influence the supply of money often to tackle inflation to ensure price stability. 10) Fiscal Policy - Fiscal policy is a mean by which the Government tries to influence the economy by adjusting its spending and tax rates. Both Monetary and Fiscal policy are considered to be sister strategies. 11) FDI - When a company or an individual of one country invests in an another country either in form of establishing business enterprise or by acquiring business asset is called FDI. 12) Budget - A budget is an estimate of the expenditure and revenue of the government relating to the future period. There are two types of budget. A) Balanced Budget - In the balanced budget both the expenditure and the revenue are equal over a period of time. B) Unbalanced budget - In Unbalanced budget revenue and expenditure are not equal. If revenue is more it is called Surplus Budget, if expenditure is more it is called Deficit Budget. For a rookie investor - 1) Shares - Shares represent a part of the total share capital of the company. There are two types of share A) preferential share - This type of share is for those who are very much concerned about their investment and not willing to take much risk. They have preference over the equity share holders in profit and at the time of winding up. They get a fixed rate of dividend. There are 8 types of preference shares. B) Equity share holders - Here there is no fixed rate of dividend the level of dividend fluctuates with the level of profit. Dividend is paid after Interest is paid to the debenture holder and dividend paid to preferential share holders. At the time of winding up of the company they receive their capital only after the debenture holders and preferential holders are paid. 2) Debenture - Debenture is a document which either acknowledges the debt or creates one. It is one of the most popular form of borrowing from the public. Debenture holders get a fixed rate of interest. There are 8 types of debentures. 3) Interest and dividend - Interest is paid only to debenture holders it is a charge on profit. Dividend is paid to share holders it is an appropriation of profit. 4) Prospectus - Prospectus is an invitation to the public asking the public to subscribe it's shares and debentures by the company. It will contain all the essential information's required for a investor to subscribe to its shares and debentures. 5) Premium, Discount and Forfeiture -A) When shares are issued at a price higher than the face value it is called premium.For eg suppose the face value is 10rs the issue price is 12rs premium then premium is 2rs. B) When shares are issued at a price less than the face value of share it is called issue at discount. C) Forfeiture - When shares are confiscated by the company for non payment of call money it is called forfeiture. 6) Share market - Share market is a place where the shares of the companies are sold, it may involves all those companies which are listed in the stock exchange plus other companies. 7) Stock exchange - Stock exchange is a place where shares and debentures of only those companies listed are sold There are two nationally recognized stock exchange in India they areA) Bombay Stock exchangeB) National stock exchangePlus there are 21 regional stock exchange 8) Mutual fund - A mutual fund is an investment fund of share holders or pool of money of share holders which are traded in different or diversified holdings. There are many more THANK YOU. Criticism are welcomed. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, productivity does not create value, it convert real value into use value (products, services). This use value doesn\u2019t have value but have worth that can be exchanged to other worth. Production process and consumption process inevitably cause pollution, and use decay also produce waste and pollution, waste is negative value, which is pollution, pollution is the destruction on human public / common owned real value. We can see productivity does not create value but consume real value and in the meantime produce waste and pollution. It causes a total social wealth reducing process. Value is the thermodynamic negative entropy, which is converted from positive entropy in the extreme conditions in central black holes of galaxies. Value cannot be created or destroyed; it only can be transformed from one form to another. Though in normal conditions, it only can be transformed from real value into use value and use will decay into negative value --- waste, the real value will be consumed less and less by natural processes and human activities, it is a entropy growing process which is irreversible (in normal conditions). Real value decays irreversibly by natural processes and human activities in normal conditions. Only in the extreme conditions of central black holes, positive entropy can be transformed into negative entropy and be cast out into vast space to be step by step, level by level delivered to local space and time in limited quantity and available time span. That is the reason human work cannot create value, human work cannot reverse the process of real value consumption to convert use value into real value, real value consumption cannot be compensated by use value (money, labour, products\u2026), environment damage and pollution cannot be reversed by human work or compensated by use value, economy cannot grow unlimitedly, human society cannot become material wealth extremely affluent society --- we have to act according to efficiency principle to reach perpetual future but natural process cannot lead us to far future. What human work is valuable for is that it does what the nature cannot do directly by itself --- information evolution on thinking information level; and that is where human future is decided by how we perform in that task. What all human activities are about is convert real value (thermodynamic negative entropy) into effective information, and do it efficiently. The efficiency is the real value \u2013 effective information efficiency, in this efficiency, the real value consumption and use value production both have to be minimised to conform to this efficiency. Wealth includes both real value and use value, though the ultimate source of wealth is real value. Human work, which you call productivity, creates nothing but converted the real value into use value irreversibly that changed the proportional composition of the social wealth --- reduced its real value component and increased its use value component. This process is irreversible and the use value decay with time quickly and then become negative value --- rubbish and pollution, this irreversible process decided economic growth only lead to the absolute impoverishment of human society as a whole entity --- the exhaustion of real value will lead to the worth total evaporation for both capital and labour, globalised exhaustion of real value only mean globalised evaporation of use value (capital and labour) that means nowhere to escape. The total social wealth is composed of real value and use value, and it is divided by private owned and public / common owned, especially the real value part --- the vast majority of the real value is public owned. The wealth in economics is mostly refer to the use value, just a small part of real value such as land, mine, are being privately owned, but the vast majority of the real value such as the land mass, water body, the atmosphere, sunshine, geothermal energy, the ecosystem\u2026 are human public / common owned. The economic activities or you call it productivity convert these real value into use value and own it, turn it into private owned wealth. Economic activities cause these results:1.\tTurned public wealth into private wealth by converting the public owned resources (including environment health) into private own use value. Value is not created, the worth of use value is converted from the real value and this process is irreversible.2.\tIrreversibly reduced the quantity of the total social wealth by converting the everlasting (same life span as the Earth ecosystem) real value into fast decaying use value.Convert real value into use value and in the meantime reduced the total social wealth --- the real value loss is irreversible while the use value converted from it is decaying fast and turning into negative value --- waste and pollution. Most of the produced use value is unnecessary and even harmful in the first place --- they are negative value even before they decay.3.\tIrreversibly changed the total social wealth composition proportion --- reduced real value component and increased use value component that irreversibly reduced the quality of the total social wealth. It is a manmade acceleration of the entropy growing process.4.\tWhile in the meantime externalising the negativities (such as pollution, destruction of environment, resources exhaustion, inflation\u2026) to the rest of the world --- the public and the future generations.5.\tConcentrating the use value into the hands of fewer and fewer people\u2019s hands.6.\tWhile accelerating the process of the worth evaporation of use value by destroying the base for the worth of use value --- real value. When real value is depleted, the use value will be worthless and the power in it will be gone. So this use value concentration process is a self-destruction process if follow it to the bitter end. Sweet process has a bitter end.7.\tSo for the process level winners, they have an optimal point to stop this natural process and turn into rational process before the power in their hands is evaporated out to nothing. They have to do it in time to turn the process level win into system level win that enable human to reach far future; otherwise there will be an all lose result --- human extinction.8.\tOtherwise natural process will only be the violent zig zag major fluctuation of economic boosts and collapses that brings the population fluctuation with it and this process continue until all real value depleted and this process ends. Natural process only lead to natural ending, there will never be rational process naturally come out of it and naturally corrects the natural path into rational path that can save human future. It has to be totally depending on human rational thinking driven rational efforts to break the stability of natural process and connect human into rational process. It is the human rational will of survival verses the natural process stability. It is simply be or not to be. That is the essence of the issue. The natural process of free competition locked all human into the vicious cycle:It is the use value that has the power in it, but it is the real value we depend on to survive. The natural mechanism of free competition and natural selection locked all human in the accelerated consumption of real value that pushing all human towards extinction but no one can jump out of this vicious cycle due to this behavioural strategy is the stable strategy in this natural process run social system. Only by changing the social environment conditions, this vicious cycle can be broken and human can be saved. But only rational system can keep rational process stable and function, so after all, it is a system issue. Money is the symbolic representative of the use value guaranteed by authority to be used as exchange and storage media / means. Capital is accumulated use value. Economy is the human activities that convert real value into use value to make a living or to accumulate power. Economy cannot grow unlimitedly due to the real value this activity depend on to proceed is limited on Earth. Human fundamentally live on real value but not use value, so the economy which is the human activities of converting real value into use value can endanger human present and future survival if let it naturally develop. This productivity does not produce value but instead it destroys value and turns it into negative value --- wastes and pollutions. Lifting productivity is lifting the efficiency of the destructive process. Increase productivity is the microeconomic measure to enhance the competition ability of individuals and groups; it is not a macroeconomic level solution for human survival or human living conditions improvement. Whether you lifting productivity by scale increase (increase investment, labour\u2026) or efficiency increase (improvement in science and technology, management\u2026), the destructive nature of productivity in our society and on our natural environment will not change but increase its destructive effects. The purpose of economy is wrong:Economy is supposed to serve the human final goal of perpetual future but instead it put the material wealth of use value as the final goal. That will exhaust the real value base to shorten the effective evolution time for human to reach far future. According to efficiency, the material wealth production should be minimised. Human work or you call it productivity converts real value into use value, in this process, it did not create value but produce the worth of the products or services which can be exchanged with other worth, and when it is exchanged into the universal worth --- money, it can be stored and accumulated as capital. Capital is accumulated use value which has concentrated power in it. But the worth of use is based on real value conditions, the deterioration of real value conditions cause the worth of use evaporation. Every step forward we make is based on the former contributors of natural science and social science --- we just step on the shoulders of the giants to go higher. But we should not stop at what they have done for us and not give out our contribution to disappoint the former contributors. Value is the issue former social science hasn\u2019t solved which need our effort to deal with. It is a crucial issue that decide the economy and human future. You have no choice but make your attempt to deal with it. And it is the time to do so as the economy is getting into exponential progression stage of development. Both natural science and social science are based on thermodynamics. Thermodynamic processes control the development of both natural system and human social system. As the progressing of natural science opened the way in thermodynamics, we have the tool / means to solve the value issue in economics on the highest level --- science philosophy level. As a matter of fact, NASA pictures have showed us where the value is coming from --- central black holes. We don\u2019t have to feel the way with our hands and feet, because the light of science is showing us the way. ",
