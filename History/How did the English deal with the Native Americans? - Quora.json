            "answer_text": "Depends on the Native Americans. Some tribes were bitter enemies of the English, while other tribes were close allies of the English. Groups like the Powhatan Confederacy repeatedly attacked the English and massacred colonists and troops, so there was great bitterness and many wars. Other groups like the Iroquois were close friends of the English for many generations. The British were, for much of this period, the most powerful empire on earth. The Iroquois were among the most native American tribes in eastern North America. Their military prowess and brutality was legendary. Armed by their British allies, they conquered much of the American Midwest, destroying or displacing the tribes in their path. Together the British and Iroquois battled against the French and the Huron, their traditional enemies respectively. Later, when America declared independence, the Iroquois attacked the American colonists in alliance with the Crown, and after the war, received refuge in British Canada. Indeed, depending on which tribes you\u2019re talking about, in which period of history, in which part of the Americas, the interaction between the English/British and the natives changed dramatically.

            "answer_text": "Read \u201cThe Barbarous Years\u201d for detail: there was no one way. There was triangulation and more between the French, English, Spanish and various tribal groups as allies changed and advantage was sought. A trading system grew involving and affecting all, as locals wanted metal goods like knives and pots and eventually guns and Europeans wanted beaver pelts and farmland. William Penn was one of the few to engage in something like equal-to-equal negotiation to purchase land; mostly the Europeans simply did not recognize title to land in any hunter-gatherers, migrating peoples, people who thought of land as in trust for a whole people, or people who did not defend their land from seizure. Also an understanding of infectious diseases was poor so the English flattered themselves into thinking the great die-off was God\u2019s providential gift to themselves of land found vacant or with reduced populations. Massive cultural misunderstanding was common, but so was mutual dependence; violence was common, with individual crime and war crime, and more organized versions. But intermarriage and \u201cgoing native\u201d also occurred. ",
