            "answer_text": "Yes indeed, I designed and created my own website at M-Auwal Gene III's Website It\u2019s important to note as follows, though: I did not write ALL the codes! I only first of all focused on designing what I wanted my layouts and colour schemes to look like.Then I started writing the basic codes (php, html, css, javascripts) as well as creating the images (using CorelDRAW).Next, I added the database functionalities (eg: the random quotes and the user comments).After I saw that it was looking good, I took a break for some months and concentrated on dong other things elsewhere as well as reading more. Then I discovered many ways of improving and then I came back and improved more in areas like: The landing page, which I got the idea from somewhere (sorry, I cant remember the reference right now).The menu bars (WELCOME, ESSAYS, POETRY, QUOTABLES, STUDENTS, etc) were also based on ideas I got from somewhere (sorry again, I can\u2019t remember the reference at this time).Then my wedding came along (You Are Invited \u21d2 Auwal Gene \u2665 weds \u2665 Hadiza Umar) and I decided to just save time for that segment of my site by simply buying and modifying a responsive template from Free Responsive Mobile Website Templates Designs - w3layouts.com (I went to the Weddings section and chose the \u201cPARTNER\u201d template which served my purpose very well).So in summary, yes I designed and built my site by myself (and I also do for many people); but I also get ideas fr0m other developers (either for free or for some fees) to make my life easier. Hope this answers your questions fully. ~Namaste :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes my first website was an experiment of what I learned. I coded it from the scratch working each and every part of the website- design, backened, database and everything else one could think of. I tried to make it mobile responsive but at that time bootstrap wasn't available so had to do it myself only and speaking the truth the mobile version was not at all good. :D But as I made the website I learnt more new things, experimented with them or in better terms played with them. I love to make websites and that interest was what made me go on, and here now I stand having made more than 50 websites on my own till date. And sorry I can't share the link to my website since I put it down in a year and believe it was pretty bad. :p ;) :D Throgh these days I have learnt that if you have to learn something you need to get your hands dirty, so hop in and start the journey. Hope this ananswered your query. :) If you need any help, feel free to ask. ",

My main task was to create a design that featured a great user experience and a site that interacted with the user. I think it turned out pretty well. Although I did not hand code it. I used a much faster option than hand coding (since I am pretty slow) but still allowed me to build with clean code (in case I would like to edit the site later). The software I used is called Webflow. Fuza.io Website Design Agency is the site I had created. ",

            "answer_text": "Web-Development was and is, my area of interest since long. Coming to the question, I created my first website at the age of 11. All it had was a page or two of HTML and some css along with some external links. But now\u2026 times have changed and so do I. Coded 3 more websites by the age of 16; used all my knowledge of languages like Html, Css, Javascript, Php\u2026 integrated a few databases with MySql and explored a few of the programming domains like Java, Ruby. So yeah, I was the one to code first! But now I am shifting to CMS (content management systems) like, Wordpress, Drupal and Joomla because they are easy to use and integrate. Their drag and drop functionality save me from coding a ton of stuff, line by line and they are really good in terms of creating great web content. ",
