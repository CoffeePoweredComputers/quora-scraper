            "answer_text": "As usual,Our military got ready to fight the last war it was in or got dismantled . We always historically drew down military forces and had to have time to hastily train and deploy green troops. We can't really do that now, but we will.

The Congress band around bitching about Trump and doesn't get anything done in spite of him. and And they. won't do enough to stop his crap or support whatever he might have done right. it seems all Congress does is fight and bicker and complain. They should present the facts of the Russia investigation and close it. Indict and prosecute whoever broke the law and get over it. ",
