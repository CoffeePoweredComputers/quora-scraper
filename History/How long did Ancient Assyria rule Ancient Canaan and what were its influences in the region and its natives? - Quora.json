            "answer_text": "Assyria conquered Galilee and the Canaanite city of Dor and the surrounding territory shortly before conquering neighbouring Israel \u2014 in about 722 BCE. Three provinces were created \u2014 two for the Canaanites in Galilee and coastal Canaan, and one for the former kingdom of Israel. Assyria held these territories continuously until its defeat by an alliance led by the Medes and Babylonians in about 609 BCE \u2014 a period of just over a hundred years. Nothing much changed for the residents of Galilee and Dor, as they simply had new imperial masters. ",
