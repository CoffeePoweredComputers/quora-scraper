            "answer_text": "Israelites were white caucasian people, I am 100% percent sure of it. \u201cBiblical account\u201d Song of Solomon: 5:10 and 5:14 describe the appearance of the male long story protagonist as \u201cMy beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.\u201d and \u201cHis hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires\u201d. White caucasian people usually have the pale reddish skin. 1:6, 7:2 and 7:4 describe the appearance of the female love story protagonist as \u201cLook not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me\u201d and \u201cThy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies\u201d and \u201cThy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus\u201d So the girl has wheat colored dark skin and a towerish pointy nose. White people can be tanned by sun, I am sure she is white because high nose bridge is the most basic trait for white caucasian people. According to Bible, the ancestors of Israelites were Abraham and Sarah, they both came from the cit of Ur, which is in Chaldea/Babylon/Sumer/Mesopotamia, nowdays iraq, Iraqis are Arabians, and Arabians were categorized as white people in the constitution law of US. I watched a BBC Bible mystery series which says that DNA test says that the genes in modern Israelis and ancient Caananites were identical, so I guessed ancient Mesopotamians looked just like Iraqis. However Israelites could take foreign wives, but still they were probably only white girls around,. In fact, Genesis chapter 10 does not mention any non-white nations. Every nation included in Genesis chapter 10 is semitic tribe. Even the Cushites. ",

            "answer_text": "Original Question: What did the Israelites look like? The original Israelite people, which I presume is what you\u2019re meaning, were Semitic people who\u2019d originally emigrated out of Canaan and into the higher ground further inland, approximately where the West Bank region is today. This emigration started around the 12th century BCE and continued for a couple of hundred years. Their appearance would have been typically Eastern Mediterranean; Caucasian but with a skin tone which varied between white and olive/pale brown. Dressed in the same clothes, you\u2019d probably be hard-pushed to spot any difference between people from the original Israel of around 3,000 years ago, to those of modern Israel. Thanks for the A2A. ",
