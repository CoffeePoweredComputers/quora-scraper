            "answer_text": "I guess the answer to this would vary largely depending on the priorities of the person doing the comparison, but it seems many lists are consistent on which Presidents rank as the least healthy. Predictably considering society's weight fetish, Grover Cleveland and William Howard Taft are usually at the bottom--one list I found, though, put William Henry Harrison in last place due to the pneumonia and other conditions that cut short his term after only a month. Other leaders who commonly land at the bottom include Eisenhower, Reagan, Kennedy, Madison, Jackson, Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, Harding, Monroe, and Washington. The various conditions suffered by these men could fill a lengthy essay, but note that many of them lived in a time of relatively primetive medical care and shorter lifespans--and even in the modern era, it seems Presidents have had to struggle with numerous physical ailments, as has humanity in general; it would be rarer to find Presidents who have had near perfect health, though there have been a few (Hayes, John Quincy Adams, and Obama figure prominently here.) If you think I'm going to being in the current incumbent, forget it. Beyond his most recent health crisis, the state of Donald Trump's health is uncertain due to the often politicized state of the modern media, combined with the web if rumour and innuendo that have increasingly replaced professional journalism. In addition, lately we can't even rely on Trump's own doctors, who are supposed to be our No. 1 source, to be completely truthful regarding his health. ",

            "answer_text": "This question involves a plural subject; \u2018who are the least fit presidents in history?\u2019 The least fit President is so blatantly unfit that any attempt at a list, or even a pair, is totally eclipsed by the glaring and exclusive possession of the term unfit, by Donald J. Trump. His ignorance is exceeded only by his narcissism. He has no knowledge of American History; the subject of Civics is Greek to him. The Constitution is a doormat upon which he wipes his feet. He had broken every rule of morality in the annals of presidency. His insults and impropriety are legion. He has enriched himself and his family in plain site of the Nation he swore to protect. He has gathered a cadre of opportunists only the worst governments in history have ever seen. Our national resources and ecological safeguards have been for sale throughout his administration. As an example of his abject absurdity, he removed his county from the aegis of the World Health Organization during a global pandemic. But his most egregious mental deficit is that he does not even know the definition of the word \u201cPresident\u201d, he sees himself as a king, totally above the law, and free to do as he wishes. ",
