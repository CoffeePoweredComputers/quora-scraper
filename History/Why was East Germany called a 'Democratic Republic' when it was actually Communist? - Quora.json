            "answer_text": "Many countries that are authoritarian in nature use, and have used, \"Democratic\", or \"Democratic Republic of\", even when they're anything but that. Some notable examples are the DPRK(Democratic peoples Republic of Korea) and the DRC(Democratic Republic of Congo). In my opinion, countries that utilise this in their name are just trying to sound good; it doesn't actually mean that the country in question is more democratic, and it's actually a pretty useful indicator as to which countries are oppressive.Tl;dr- it's a PR stunt for oppressive regimes to have nice names. Doesn't actually mean anything. ",

The UK is also a democracy, but it is a monarchy (the Head of State is not elected). The USA has gerrymandered electorates (which means, inter alia, that a candidate can get 3 Million votes more than her opponent, but still not be elected), but it is still called a democracy. Democracy means different things to different people - we can\u2019t judge others by our standards (particularly when some of our own standards are highly questionable). ",
