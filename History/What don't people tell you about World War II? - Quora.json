            "answer_text": "After the United States participated in World War II, Churchill said something meaningful: \"If we had taken common measures to protect our safety, this disaster would never have fallen on our heads. (1) The enemy can only march on our corpses, and the Soviets can't kill them. -Said Cuikov, the commander of the military region who served as the defender of Stalingrad. \u2475.

(Nuts!). \u2478. We will fight at sea, we will fight in the sky, we will fight at the beach, we will fight at the fields and mountains... we will never surrender... -Churchill. \u2479. Give me a marshal cane, it is better to give me a division-Hitler requested reinforcements in the face of North Africa, only gave Rommel a marshal empty title, Rommel had complained. \u247a.

Advance, advance until the gasoline is exhausted, and then start walking. \u2014\u2014Barton. \u247d. Rewarding one hundred dollars is worse than chopping a little devil. \u2014\u2014In the Great Wall Anti-Japanese War, the 29th Army announced that it would capture a Japanese alive and reward the foreigner for a hundred dollars. The soldiers of the Dadao team said to the chief officer: Rewarding a hundred dollars is worse than cutting a devil. \u247e. OK, let's go on the road!-Normandy, the place where the mist is low, is the long-awaited second battlefield. After listening to the weather report, Eisenhower said lightly. \u247f. For the world, he is just a soldier; for his mother, he is the whole world. --- Epitaph of soldiers killed in the Battle of Alaman. \u2480.

You fill it in, and I will fill it in \u2014 the battle of Taierzhuang, Sun Lianzhong asked for instructions on the phone: \"Report to the sir, the second group army has seven tenths of casualties, the enemy fire is too strong, the offensive is too fierce, but we also consume the enemy It\u2019s almost the same. Can you ask the chief to promise to temporarily retreat to the south bank of the canal, so that the second army can retain some seeds, and it\u2019s also the great grace of the chief!

At this time, Yu knew that the reinforcements could not arrive as scheduled, and determined that the whole division would die in Changde. This was a message he sent to the commander-in-chief, Sun Lianzhong, and Sun immediately burst into tears. ",

            "answer_text": "I have used this in another answer. Every participant country in war committed \u2018war crimes\u2019. Patton had two: a captain who machine-gunned a group of prisoners \u2018attempting to escape\u2019; and a sergeant who really did not like Germans-he hit a POW in the throat with a knife, killing him. Patton took no official action, but send them both to the front. The Captain was KIA, but the NCO survived the war.A Brit Royal Navy captain machine-gunned German swimmers in the water after his PT boat sank their barge off Italy. The crew of a US PT radar boat, leading this UK group, saw it.A U-boat crew who did the same to Allied sailors, whose ship they sunk, shot them in the water. Wiki: \u201cEck, Hoffmann, and Weisspfennig were sentenced to death. Weisspfennig was condemned because as a non-combatant under the Geneva Conventions, he was prohibited from firing weapons even in action. Eck and Hoffmann were executed because in their roles as the boat's senior officers, responsibility for the actions of their crew, as well as their own, fell directly on their shoulders. All three were shot by firing squad at L\u00fcneberg Heath on 30 November 1945.\u201d In this instance the movie \u201cMurphy\u2019s War\u201d was based on this incident. See: U-boat commander massacres survivors in the waterAfter the SS massacred a group of US POW at the Battle of the Bulge it was open season on SS troops. German Army tankers who wore black uniforms gave up saying, \u201cMe no SS\u201d.During the Falklands war, see Daily Mail article, Mt Tumbledown and \u2018no prisoners\u2019. A very dirty war: British soldiers sot dead by enemy troops waving the white flag and Argentinian prisoners bayoneted in cold blood. An ex-Para tells of the horrors of the FalklandsOmar Bradley in Normandy said, \u201cThose snipers think they can kill three Americans and jump down, raise the hands and surrender. No way\u201d.At the Battle of the Bismark sea, about 1000 Japaneses sailors/soldiers had been blown out of their ships, by the US 3rd Attack Group. B-25 with skip bombs and 8 forward firing .50 cal machine guns. They were close to shore, and at the beginning of the battle a Japanese fighter had shot down a US B-17 and machine gunned the crew in parachutes. That did not go over well with the 3rd. The leader told the attackers, \u201cAny one with qualms can go home now\u201d. He then lead the group and machine-gunned the survivors in the water. (This had been prohibited by Hague Convention of 1907, but did not stop them.)Mush Morton, CO of the sub Wahoo, sank a Japanese ship, saw a bunch of survivors in the waters, surfaced and got the crew to machine-gun the survivors.This is the grim face of war. Young, tired, boys, with weapons often lose it. The fact that they dehumanize the enemy: slopes, dinks, gooks, krauts, macaronis, etc., make them appear less than human. Update: this ensures the safety of a POW, and is the way the US likes to view itself:  The boy is 10, in full Heer uniform and therefore a legitimate target for a US soldier, therefore the SSgt is holding his hand.
