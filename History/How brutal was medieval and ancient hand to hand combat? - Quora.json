            "answer_text": " I think one thing which particularly added to the brutality of ancient melee fights were the executions. You didn't just stab a guy- you followed through with an execution stab to make sure he's not going to stand up suddenly and stab you in the back. Thanks to our ingenuity, we soon realised swords and spears and crushing weapons like the warhammer are too basic. As such, let's look at the less common forms of weapons like the Morningstar:  It punctures you like a balloon because a sword doesn't cut it anymore. It's like catching a really sharp hedgehog. Halberd  A cross between a spear and an axe because when we wish we could dual-wield them, some genius blacksmith decides to combine the blades together! A complete knightmare! Unfortunately, your insides tend to start unravelling and your tender skin cannot hold them together any longer so intestines tend to start coming out. I will do you a favour and leave the Googling to you. Ancient combat used animals such as horses for cavalry charges that trampled its foes- woe to whoever had to face heavily armored horses and their riders. If you didn't get skewered by the spears, you would become roadkill- broken bones and back, easy pickings for anyone who wishes to give you a mercy killing. ",

A medieval/classical era battlefield is probably one of the most horrifically brutal experiences that man could ever endure. Man, I could not imagine fighting in such brutal hand to hand combat as depicted in the paintings. I would not to feel my arm being sliced off with a sword, or have my face split in half with an ax.
