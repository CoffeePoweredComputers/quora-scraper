            "answer_text": "For Britain and its empire, an excellent detailed day by day infographic can be found here From that, British casualties appear to have been clocked up at a pretty steady rate from 1916 to 1918 at around 280,000 killed each year. For other countries the pattern will be different, not least as France, Germany, Austria and Russia all mobilised large land armies immediately, while the bulk of the British wartime recruits were not trained and equipped for service until 1916. Looking at the day by day chart you can see that famous actions of the BEF like the battle of Mons and first Ypres barely show up at all - the biggest British losses in 1914 were at sea, at Coronel and the sinkings of 22 September. At the same time, the French were suffering huge losses in the Battle of the Frontiers and on the Marne, as were the Russians at Tannenberg. I do not have data to hand for other nations, but the obvious guess for the year with largest casualties would be 1916, with Verdun, the Somme, the Brusilov Offensive and the Isonzo all seeing many men killed on both sides. The final collapse of the central powers and the related offensives on the Western and Italian fronts, with added Spanish flu, could conceivably make 1918 worse overall, although the closure of the eastern front makes it unlikely. As a final note, be careful with figures for casualties and deaths like this - remember that many people died of wounds days, weeks, months or even years after the events that caused them. Unlike the charts, the dying did not stop on 11 November 1918. ",
