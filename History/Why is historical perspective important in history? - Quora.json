            "answer_text": "History is important because the past is often prologue to the future. In addition history tells us how we got where we are. Lastly, we can learn from the mistakes of the past. If Hitler ha studied the Napoleonic invasion of Russia he would have avoided Operation Barbarossa. Perspective is important because it influences the historian\u2019s interpretation of events and can even cause him/her to exaggerate or detract from important events. ",

            "answer_text": "Without historical perspective we risk judging people and situations under our common, present point of view. Time gives us the possibility to understand the social, economic and political motivations of people. If we want to have a clear, panoramic view of a particular land, its mountains, rivers and forests, we need ample distance. Someone said that \u2018the past is a foreign country\u2019, and we need to approach it that way. ",
