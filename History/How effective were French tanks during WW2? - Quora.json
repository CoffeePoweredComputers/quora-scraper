            "answer_text": "French tanks for the most part, were kinda meh. While they were terrifyingly powerful and advanced for their time, they suffered from a huge number of issues, which combined with the poor tactical and strategic choices made by the French, meant that for the most part, their overall performance during the war was rather poor. Thanks to the fact that for a large portion of the war, they were under German rule, French tanks during WW2 didn\u2019t really have a connected progression in design. Thus they were split into two time periods. French tanks before the Fall of France, and French tanks after the Fall of France. Prior to the Fall of France, French tanks were split into two categories. Infantry tanks and Cavalry tanks. Infantry tanks were designed to be slow and incredibly heavily armoured. They were the breakthrough and assault tanks that were designed to shrug off enemy fire while being slow enough so that infantry could keep up.  An example of this is the Char B1 Heavy tank Cavalry Tanks were designed to be extremely fast and mobile, often at the cost of armour, and were meant to exploit openings that the Infantry tanks created.  While the Somua S35 was a cavalry tank, it was also very well armed and armoured for its time These tanks massively outclassed tanks of other nations of their time. However, these tanks suffered massively from a huge number of ergonomic issues. The most notable of them was the fact that the vast majority were seriously under crewed with one man turrets(Imagine the commander being the commander, gunner and loader. Feel sorry for him), which seriously hampered performance. Combine this with serious flaws in their strategic deployment, and it explains their relatively poor performance during the war. After the Fall and subsequent liberation of France, French tank development mostly slowed to a crawl(as they were still trying to get organised and seriously lacking in resources), and really only developed one notable tank which took a more different design approach to earlier tanks.  The ARL44 Heavy Tank The ARL44 was a project for France to resume development of tanks. Although originally intended to be a medium tank, the prototypes quickly grew in size and weight as more armour and larger armament were placed on the tank. The armour was superior to both the armour on the Panther and the Tiger 1. The ARL44 would\u2019ve also been intended to be armed with either an American 90mm or a British 17 Pounder making it very well armed for its time. Mobility however was awful. The tank used an incredibly old suspension system and combined with the weight, resulted in terrible mobility. The ARL 44 never actually saw combat but it arguably would\u2019ve been a reasonably decent tank, especially in its ability to effectively engage tanks like the Tiger 1 and Panther on somewhat equal terms. Overall, French tanks weren\u2019t bad, but they weren't great either. The did have some seriously powerful tanks, especially early on during the war, but they suffered from numerous issues which seriously hampered their performance. By the time France was liberated however, they weren\u2019t really in a position to properly develop and send tanks into combat(also the rest of the Allies were practically steamrolling the Germans at that point), so we\u2019ll never really know how they would\u2019ve performed.

            "answer_text": "Alright, buckle up, this is going to be a long one. I\u2019m an huge enthusiast when it comes to the army France fought with in 1940 and its equipment. I have been pretty much since I have joined English-speaking communities interested in WW2, towards late 2014. Since then, I have read quite a lot of things about the material France went to war with - artillery, firearms, but more than anything else armored vehicles - and I have seen a lot of misconceptions thrown around about them. With this answer, I will try to bust as many of those as I can. The most common one I have seen is by far the idea that, by 1940, France had the best tanks. I feel like this idea was mostly created by a rather superficial school of thought regarding tank design - the same that would, for example, consider the Tiger as the best tank of the war and the T-34 and Sherman as very mediocre. The idea of the superiority of French tanks against their German opponents also feed the myth of Wehrmacht of 1940 being an underdog - something which was true in reputation only, as the Germans ended up having a superiority in not only command, but also numbers and equipment, when facing the French, British, Dutch and Belgian forces.  The mighty, 31.5-tons monster of a tank the B1 Bis was. The heaviest, most heavily armored and heavily armed tank that took part in the Battle of France, the B1 Bis if often said to have been the best tank of the conflict. The reality about this beast is not as shiny and attractive as it may seem, though. I will divide this answer in several categories, as a number of various types of French tanks with various flaws and sometimes qualities existed. I. The light infantry tanks (R35/40, H35/39, FCM 36): How not to design an up-to-date tank The Renault R35, Hotchkiss H35 and FCM 36 were all born out of the same specifications, which were formulated by the French Army in 1933. By that time, the workhorse and most common tank the French had, the venerable FT which proved excellent in World War I, was quickly falling into obsolescence, with designs derived from the British Vickers 6-tons and American Christie now being at the forefront of light tank design. The new specifications the French Army sent to France\u2019s various manufacters were vastly inspired by the FT: they requested a vehicle that was particularly unambitious: those called for a vehicle with a crew of two, with an armament of either a 7.5mm machine-gun or a 37mm SA 18 gun, a mass of 6 tons and an armor of 30mm (which were raised to a mass of 8 tons and an armor of 40mm in 1934), a maximum speed of 15 to 20 km/h and an autonomy of at least 40km, to sum up the most basic ones. A number of other, less relevant requirements existed, for examples in terms of ground pressure, crossing capacities, ect. In short, pretty much all aspect of the vehicle had already been determined by the French Army\u2019s services, leaving little to no space for innovativeness for the various engineers of France\u2019s military industry. The root of arguably the most disastrous aspect of France\u2019s 1940 tank force could be found in those requirements. What the French army envisionned with those was little more than a modern remake of the old FT - keeping the same armament of either a machine-gun or a 37mm infantry support gun, the same crew of two, only ever-so-slightly upgrading the maximum speed, with the only considerable improvement over the 1917 vehicle being a thicker armor. Those very tight requirements led to the five companies that manufactured prototypes, Renault, Hotchkiss, FCM, Batignolles-Ch\u00e2tillons and APX, creating designs which, outside of perhaps FCM\u2019s vehicle (and by extension the Batignolles which was a copycat of the FCM), were laughably similar to one another. In the end, three models were adopted, the Renault R35, Hotchkiss H35 and FCM 36 - though the APX model did leave its mark in the form of a modified version of its turret, designated APX-R, being used on both the H35 and R35 -. The comparison between the H35 and R35 was so incredibly similar you\u2019d hardly believe they had been designed independently from one another. Their heights, widths and lenghts were extremely similar, with the largest difference been in the H35 being 20cm longer, with 4.22 meters (it was just a little bit larger in general - 2cm higher than the R35 with 2.15 meters, and 8cm wider with 1.95m). Both had cast construction and a very similar armor layout: the R35 had 40 to 43mm on the hull front, 40mm on the sides and 35mm on the rear, the H35 had 35mm all-around the hull. That armor was actually quite thick for a tank of the time, which was not surprising considering the vehicle\u2019s role as infantry tanks; they were immune from the Panzer II\u2019s 20mm gun, but not from the 37mm PaK 36 or the guns of the same caliber mounted on Panzer IIIs, 35(t) and 38(t). Both the R35 and H35 of course had the same turret, the APX-R, with 40mm of protection all-around and a 45mm mantlet, and both has the same armament - which was of a 37mm SA 18 AND a 7.5mm MAC 31 coaxial machine-gun, instead of just one of either as in the requirements.  A Renault R35 that the French army tested against PaK 36 discretly acquired from Spain. As those test shows, the French tank, while well-armed for a vehicle of this size, was still vulnerable to the standard German anti-tank gun. That armament deserves a little bit more attention though. The MAC 31 was a regular, and even fairly good tank machine-gun, there isn\u2019t much to say here. The SA 18 though\u2026 oh boy. That gun was, by the 1930s, old; it was a derivate of the 1916 APX 37mm field gun, intended to be used from the trenches to fire on enemy machine-gun nests. The SA 18 was the version modified to fit in the old FT of 1917 - it was the exact same gun that was now to be fitted on its successor. That SA 18 was a short gun - L/21 - that fired incredibly small shells - 37x94mmR. In comparison, the Soviet 45mm shells were 310mm long. With such small dimensions, and a short barrel, the French shells were particularly small and vastly lacked punch; the velocity of the SA 18 was an abysmal 367 m/s when firing high explosive shells (which had a just puny charge of 30 gramms of explosives), 388m/s when firing the mle1892/1924 APHE shells, and a better but still poor 600 m/s when firing the mle 1935 and 1937 AP shells. Those three models of anti-tank shells had laughably bad performances. With a penetration of 8mm on a plate sloped at 30\u00b0 at 400m, the APHE would litterally not be able to penetrate a Panzer II a point-blank range. The 1935 AP shells penetrated 18mm/35\u00b0 at 400m, and the 1937 ones 21mm/35\u00b0 at 400m - the shells weren\u2019t tested at 800m, because, I kid you not, they couldn\u2019t reliably strike a still target at that range - that\u2019s how bad the accuracy was. They had flaws even greater than the terrible gun though - the tanks had no radio, and their means of communications with other vehicles of their unit was litterally having the commander open the cupola and communicate with flags. Even worse, that commander was laughably overtasked. Because he was the only man in the turret, he had to reload and fire the gun, spot targets, as well as give orders to the driver. This meant that the tank generally had a terrible awareness of the situation around it and was incredibly bad at spotting potential targets; the gun\u2019s potential rate of fire was vastly reduced as well.  The mount for the 37mm SA 18 and the coaxial machine-gun that was fitted in the APX-R turret of H35/H39 and R35 tanks. The guns weren\u2019t even newly produced for most, having being taken from disarmed surviving Renault FT. While very good in WW1, the SA 18 was laughably outdated by WW2 standards and should never have been brought into combat. Both tanks had an engine that had been designed by their own firm - the R35 was powered by a 4-cylinders 85hp gasoline engine, whereas the H35 was powered by a 6-cylinders 75hp gasoline engine. They had very similar weights of 10.6 tons for the R35 and 11 for the H35. The H35 was the most mobile of the two, with a still poor 28km/h against just 20km/h (23 according to Soviet tests on a captured Polish vehicle) for the R35. Both were, in pretty much all fields, terrible - which is most likely why the French Army decided those two would be the mainstay tanks that would replace the FT. The R35 was to equip the infantry, whereas the cavalry would use the H35 (it was, after all, 8 km/h faster than its rival.) Massive orders followed. To give a little bit of credit - not too much, but a little bit still - to Renault and particularly Hotchkiss\u2019s engineers, they did try to address some of the problems faced by their tanks. After the 400th H35 was produced, Hotchkiss switched to the H39, which featured a much more powerful (120hp) engine in a larger engine bay. The result was a tank which now reached 36km/h - a speed which, while not excellent, was at least sufficient. After about 480 H39 were produced, Hotchkiss switched the SA 18 with a newer 37mm gun, the SA 38. Firing larger though still small 37x149mmR shells, the SA 38 could penetrate 30mm/30\u00b0 at 400m, and had a velocity of 705 m/s with its AP shells. The HE shells had double the explosive charge of the SA 18\u2019s, with 60 gramms, and a velocity of 600m/s. This gun was also retroactively fitted on a few tens of H35, mostly vehicles which served as the command tanks of their platoons or companies. While a considerable upgrade, the SA 38 remained pretty average for an anti-tank gun, and, most importantly, the Hotchkiss design\u2019s most pressing issues - the one-man turret - remained unsolved. A total of 400 H35 and about 710 H39 had been produced by the armistice of June 1940.  The Hotchkiss H39, particularly if armed with the SA 38 gun, did bring some improvements to the table, but absolutely failed to resolve the key issues that plagued the tank, being the disastrous ergonomics of the one-man turret and the lack of communications with the outside world. Renault, instead of focusing on making its R35 faster, worked to solve some problems it had with the suspensions, those being rather mediocre in uneasy terrain. A variety of solutions were studied - lenghtening the current suspensions, applying the suspensions of the Lorraine 37L armored logistical carrier, before a solution from the engineers of the state workshop of AMX was adopted (it had also been tested onthe H39), using a six-bogies suspension with vertical springs, which had the advantage of spreading the ground pressure in a very equal way and giving the tank a rather great all-terrain mobility, though keeping the maximum speed at just 20km/h. Those suspensions were fitted on an improved version of the R35, the R40, which undertook the same up-gunning as the late H39 did. Production switched from the R35 to the R40 just a few weeks prior to the fall of France, after about 1,540 (of which 240 were for the export) R35 had been made. The number of the R40 produced remains unknown, as the vehicles were pumped out during the chaotic fall of France, but are estimated to be of about 155 examples.  The Renault R40, as the Hotchkiss H39, did bring some interesting improvements to the table, but without the base design being sound and at least decent, they did little to improve its performance. Just two battalions, including a Polish one, had the time to receive the R40 in the chaotic last weeks of the Third French Republic. The FCM 36 differed from the Hotchkiss and Renault in a number of ways. The 12-tons tank had an overall very different look, being very angular but never having one of its armor plate be unsloped. The vehicle\u2019s armor was 40mm thick on the front and sides, though only 20mm at the rear. One of the specificities of the FCM was its 91hp diesel engine, that gave it a range of 225km, while the R35 and H35\u2019s was just 130. The vehicle went at 24km/h. It also had its own turret, keeping the angular look of the hull, although it had the same turret ring as the other tanks and could, if needed, use the APX-R as well (though that was only done for trials - the H35 was also tested with the FCM turret). That FCM turret was generally reported to be constructed with a better steel quality than the APX-R, but mounted the same armament of a 37mm SA 18 and a coaxial MAC 31 machine-gun. It was tested with the SA 38, but proved unable to withstand its recoil, the gun cracking the turret. The FCM 36 was generally mostly superior to the R35 and H35 thanks to a better armor sloping and diesel engine, but remained vastly inadequate as the key issue the other light tanks had, namely the lack of radio, anemic main armament and one-man turret crew, were also present in the FCM design. Just 100 were produced, as FCM was told to focus on the more heavily prioritized Char B1.  The FCM 36 had a better base design than the H35 and R35, but did not do anything to solve the key issues those tanks had. While its turret had better protection, it harmed the tank\u2019s potential by being too small and weak for the SA 38 37mm gun. The light infantry tanks were, for most, part of independent tank battalions of 45 vehicles, rattached to various French armies in which they would theorically be used to support infantry divisions (A number were also part of the armored battalions of the French armored divisions, the cavalry\u2019s DLMs and the infantry\u2019s DcR, which also featured most of the heavier S35, D2 and B1). In practice, those battalions proved incredibly in-adequate; with no radio in the vehicles save for a very few command tanks (that, even then, had short-ranged radios), they had no ways to communicate with supporting infantry, other tank formations, or even the tanks of their own unit - the flags communication system being incredibly inefficient under enemy fire. Generally, those regiments\u2019s vehicles either go abandoned after they ran out of fuel and were not re-supplied by a French army in general chaos, or were , after suffering losses from attacking JU 87 Stukas, decimated by German Panzer III, IV, 35 and 38(t) that were able to exploit the weakpoints of the French tanks at short-range, those being unable to retaliate thanks to both their catastrophic situational awareness and the lack of punch of their SA 18 guns. Those infantry tanks are fairly often neglected when talking about the French army of 1940, those supporting the superioty of French tanks instead discussing the S35 and B1 Bis. However, they really, really shouldn\u2019t left out of the discussion. With about 1,100 H35/39, 1,300 R35 and 100 FCM 36 in the French army\u2019s ranks by the start of the campaign, they were, by far, the most numerous one, and the most representative of the average quality of France\u2019s tanks. And, as I explained, they were very, very poor. I would go as far as saying that all German tanks with the exception of the Panzer I were superior to them - while unable to stratch them (with ammunitions avaible in 1940 at least - the Pzgr 40 would have been able too, but would only be fielded in late 1940), the Panzer II, with a two-man turret crew and radio, were far more able to co-ordinate and support infantry or exploit a breakthrough than even the SA 38-armed H39s. More than any other vehicle, hell, any other piece of equipment France used in 1940, its light infantry tanks are the best example of how horribly outdated the ideas of the higher-ups and those who formulated the requirements for French armored vehicles were. They were, from the start, unsalvageable designs, condemned to a very quick obsolescence with little to nothing being possible to upgrade them: their small turrets wouldn\u2019t fit a gun larger than the SA 38, their small size meant no larger turret ring that could allow for 2-men crew were possible, and the general backwardness of the French army in terms of communications meant that they were pretty much alone. Mating their hulls with anti-tank guns, as the Germans did with part of the fleet they captured, was probably the best use of the H35, R35 and FCM 36\u2019s hulls.  The hastly dug grave of a killed crew member of a knocked out Hotchkiss H35, 1940. Unable to communicate with other elements of the army that may cover them, as well as very badly armed and hardly able to properly locate enemies, the French army\u2019s light infantry tanks often proved to be moving coffins for their crew. II. The cavalry tanks (AMC 35, S35): Good designs shot down by terrible flaws France\u2019s somewhat larger cavalry tanks, the AMC 35 and S35, were both vehicles which, in comparison to the light infantry tank, had least had some decent strongpoints. However, both designs had a number of flaws which meant that in practice, they were far from being as optimal as they may have seemed.  The AMC 35 was a somewhat larger vehicle in comparison to the light infantry tanks; it had a rather boxy hull, and still used riveted construction. The AMC 35 was a Renault design. It was based on the previous AMC 34 light infantry tank, which the cavalry requested to have enlarged, and with the engine, put on the front of the vehicle in the AMC 34, pushed back to the rear. The French army had expected those changes to be quick to design and put into production, and this new vehicle already received orders in September of 1934 - just half a year after the AMC 34 had been ordered in March. Despite the French army\u2019s expectations, the development of the AMC 35 ended up being rather long, with the first prototype only being finished in March of 1936 and the second in January of 1937. 47 vehicles were produced from 1937 to 1939, when production stopped. A first look at the AMC 35 may show a rather promising vehicle: This 15-tons vehicle, sitting somewhat between what would be considered a light and a medium tank at the time, was a bit larger than the light infantry tanks, with 4.45m in lenght and 2.13 in width, but remained fairly compact. It admittedly had a rather lackluster armor, with a maximum of 25mm on the hull\u2019s front, but that was common to pretty much all cavalry tanks of the era. The AMC 35 was powered by a Renault 4-cylinders 180hp gasoline engine, giving it a power-to-weight ratio of about 12h/ton and a maximum speed of 42km/h, which was fairly average.The range was rather limited, with 125km on road. The AMC 35 did have a very good advantage though, in the form of its turret and armament. The AMC 35 was indeed fitted with the APX 2 turret; that model had already been used in six of the twelve AMC 34 with a 25mm SA 34 gun, but was armed with a 47mm SA 35 in the AMC 35. It had the great advantage of having space for two crew members, meaning the commander/gunner did not have to reload the gun. Speaking of which, the 47mm SA 35 was a very decent anti-tank gun. With a penetration of 40mm/30\u00b0 at 400m, and a muzzle velocity of 660 m/s, it was overall very capable when dealing with the armor vehicles engaged by Germany in 1940. With a muzzle velocity of 590 m/s and an explosive charge of 142 gramms, its explosive shells also far out-performed the ones of the SA 18, despite the latter being an infantry support guns. The gun\u2019s shells remained pretty small though, with 47x193mmR, meaning they rather easy to manipulate for the loader, giving the gun a rather great rate of fire (in theory 20 rounds per minute could be achieved, though in combat operations it would obviously be quite a lot slower). The tank also had a coaxial 7.5mm MAC 31 machine-gun with 3,400 rounds; interestingly enough, a spare MAC 31 was also stored inside the vehicle, was the coaxial machine-gun to be damaged: that feature could be found on a number of Renault tank designs of the era.  A close-up on the APX 2 turret. While, from a first look, the AMC 35 may solve a number of problem of other French tanks, it, in practice, only replaced those with a terrible mobility, lack of armor, and persisting lack of radio. Behind those appearances of being a great design, the AMC 35 had a number of huge flaws that effectively killed all chances for the vehicle to be a decent medium tank. As with light infantry tanks, it was not fitted with a radio, meaning communications with other vehicles, let alone others branches of the French Army, was basically impossible in a combat zone. Its armor was very weak, and unlike the vast majority of other French tanks, the AMC 35 still used riveted armor, (the first prototype of the Renault YR AMC 34, on which it was based on, was from 1933 after all), which was vastly inferior to the cast armor used in other French tanks in terms of structural resistance, and could create projectiles inside the tank. Worst of all though was the tank reliability. Despite being rather long, the development of the AMC 35 had been poorly made, and the vehicle\u2019s engine was prone to breaking down, as was the transmission. A report of the French army on the vehicle made in September of 1939 very laconically said that it \u201cdid not work\u201d. The small numbers of AMC 35 were not supposed to be engaged on the frontlines, instead being used by cavalry schools. 15 were put into service in hastly formed units in May of 1940, and surprisingly enough served from the Seine all the way up the Loire, with 7 remained by the end of the campaign.  The Somua S35 is a tank that is far more famous than the AMC 35 - often being mentioned alongside the B1 Bis as one of the two tanks that vastly outclassed all German opposition. The origins of the tank was actually a pre-project developped by Somua for the 1933 light infantry tank competition; while it did not reach prototype stage, the concept interest the cavalry, which viewed in it a nice potential cavalry tank was it to be enlarged: Somua\u2019s design pushed the cavalry to create a new set of requirements for an AMC (Automitrailleuse de Combat - litterally Combat Armored Car, but in 1930s France the term Automitrailleuse wasn\u2019t just used for wheeled vehicles but extended to all cavalry combat vehicles). The objective was a combat tank armed with a 47mm SA 35 gun, and protected by 40mm of armor, while maintaining a decent mobility that would make it able to exploit breakthrough. Somua delivered a first prototype, which only had an hull, in the spring of 1935; it proved very satisfactory, and was immediatly ordered, with construction of Somua\u2019s new tank starting in early 1936, deliveries of completed hull starting in July, and of completed turrets in January of 1937. The S35 was larger than previous French light and cavalry tanks, with a lenght of 5.10m, a width of 2.12 and an height of 2.62m. It had a weight of 19.5 tons in battle order, and was protected an armor of 47mm on the hull front, 45mm on the hull, sides and 35mm on the rear. The turret had up to 56mm of armor on the front and 46mm on the sides and rear. The armor was somewhat sloped, and while the angle were pretty moderate, they still improved the effective thickness to about 55 to 60mm. The Somua was powered by a Somua 8-cylinders 190hp engine that gave it a power-to-weight ratio of 9.75hp/ton. It had a maximum speed of about 40km/h. Unlike the AMC 35 though, the engine was rather reliable, and the vehicle had a longer range of 230km.  S35s in service of the Vichy Regime in French North Africa. The vehicle was fitted to with an APX 1-CE turret, a sightly larger version of the APX 1 used on the first version of the B1 Bis. This turret is often described as \u201cone and a half man\u201d turret: while two of the vehicle\u2019s three crew members sat in the hull, the S35 was large enough so that the radio operator could reach into the turret and reload the gun. While still vastly inferior to the 3-men turret of the German medium tanks or even the AMC 35\u2019s two-men turret, this solution was a considerable improvement over other French tanks. The S35 was armed with a 47mm SA 35 with 118 rounds and a coaxial MAC 31 7.5mm machine-gun with 3,750 rounds; a backup MAC 31 was stored in case the coaxial one was to jam or be damaged, and some vehicles also received anti-aircraft mounts on top of the turret, on which the backup MAC 31 could theorically be placed. Despite having a crew member dedicated to be the radio operator/loader, only platoon commanders ahd their tank fitted with a radio, an ER 29 which proved very poor - its range was of just 5km, and the signal could be disrupted by a lot of obstacles, include mere treelines, meaning the lack of communication remained a crucial flaw of the S35. A fun fact that shows how poorly implemented radios were in the S35s was that at first, the radios were placed\u2026 directly where the SA 35\u2019s rounds were ejected, meaning command tanks went mute after firing a single shell. While of course fixed by 1940, this issues says a lot about how unexperienced the French tank designers were with radios. The idea of fitting ER 28 receiver posts in all S35 was in the works in 1940, but no vehicle received those before the start of the campaign. By the 10th of May 1940, about 390 had been manufactured, though just 288 had been delivered: they served in the armored regiments of the three DLM (Light Mechanized Divisions), which each had two battalions of S35, for a total of about 80 vehicles (as well as 80 way less potent H35/H39). In combat, the S35 was a rather potent vehicle in theory, and was often able to dominate German light tanks; however, while it may occasionally have performed very well, the poor communications capacities of the S35, as well as its still lacking ergonomics, meant that it proved often incapable of supporting the Dragons Port\u00e9s infantry of the DLMs, or any other infantry for that matter, while German light tanks were generally able to do so. With the commander still having to give orders to his crew, spot targets, make decisions as well as fire the gun, the situational awareness and rate of fire of the S35 was still vastly inferior to the Panzer III, which was the closest thing to an equivalent in the Wehrmacht, and despite largely superior armor, I would personnally consider the Panzer III a superior tank thanks to its better communication capacities as well as ergonomics. While rather potent, and superior to its German equivalent in term of pure armor and firepower, the S35 was made unable to compete by its lack of capacity to co-ordinate with other branches of the military, something which was at the key of the success of German tanks.  Four S35s abandoned in a roadside ditch. The most surprising thing when looking for photos of French WW2 tanks is that the most common type of photos isn\u2019t French propaganda pictures, or even pictures of the vehicle in German service: it is instead photos taken by German soldiers, often including them posing, showing intact, abandoned French tanks. The majority of losses of French tanks weren\u2019t combat, but instead abandon, mostly of tanks that ran out of fuel or broke down and couldn\u2019t be refueled or repaired because of the collapsing supply lines. III. The heavier infantry tanks (D2, B1): The thickest armor, the biggest guns, the most regular breakdowns The larger infantry tanks, the D2 and particularly the B1 Bis, are often considered the best of the best of France\u2019s armored capacities in 1940. Their image remains, in the public imagination, as thickly armored and well-armed machines, able to slay Panzers by the tens while remaining unvulnerable to anything but the 88mm FlaK guns - an image similar to what we imagine the KV-1 was in 1941 and the Tiger I in late 1942 and early 1943. As for those two vehicles though, the truth about French infantry tanks is often far less glamorous.  D2s of De Gaulle\u2019s 507th Combat Tank Regiment parading on the 14th of July, possibly 1939. The 507th RCC had a battalion of D2 and another of R35. The original D2, while not a bad design, struggled due to a very weak anti-tank gun and a one-man turret. The Renault D2 was the lighter of the two French infantry tanks. Loosely based on the previous D1 (itself a development of the Renault NC, itself an enlarged variant of the FT, making the D2 the last vehicle in the direct line of succession to the venerable French WW1 success and interwar workshorse), the idea between the D2 was to serve as a backup to the B1. Indeed, in the early 30s, serious discussions were going on in the international community to potentially ban tanks heavier than 25 tons in the Geneva Conference of 1934, which would doom the B1. In the event of that proposal being accepted, an acceptable alternative to the B1 was needed. The D2, which had its first prototype completed in 1932, would be that alternative. The D2 was therefore pre-emptively adopted in 1933. The D2 was a medium-sized infantry tank, with a lenght of 5.23m, an width of 2.21 and an height of 2.66; it was actually surprisingly similar to the S35 in size, though the Somua would come quite a bit later than the Renault. The vehicle had a 40mm-thick armor all around the tank. It had a weight of 19 tons in combat conditions. The turret was the APX 1, the D2 being the first operationnal tank to use it. That turret was fitted with the 47mm SA 34 gun. A predecessor to the SA 35, the SA 34 was a far shorter gun, being, as the 37mm SA 18, L/21. As a result, it had rather pitiful anti-tank capacities, with a muzzle velocity of 450m/s and a penetration of 14mm/25\u00b0 at 400m. The engine was a Renault 6-cylinders 150hp gasoline engine, giving the D2 a maximum speed of 22 km/h and a range of 100km. 50 of those D2 were delivered in 1936\u20131937, replacing the older D1 (which were sent to Tunisia) in the 1st battalion of the 507th Combat Tank Regiment, which would soon come under the command of an ambitious colonel, Charles de Gaulle. While the production of the D2 stopped in 1936, it resumed in 1940, with a new order of 50 vehicles, which received a number of small modifications, the most important one being by far the replacement of the 47mm SA 34 with the SA 35.  A second series D2, armed with the longer SA 35. While fairly potent, the D2 remained plagued by a one-man turret, a mediocre mobility, and a radio that remained very short range, only used for inter-unit communications. The production of the D2 remained overall very low - just 50 of the first series and about 40 of the second were completed before the armistice, the idea of mass-producing the tank falling flat after the 1934 Geneva Conference ended up not banning tanks heavier than 25 tons, giving way for the B1 to continue its development. The D2 ended up being a simple replacement for the D1. It kept many of the flaws of other French tanks - its turret was the first APX 1 model, which was a mere one-man turret and not the one-man and a half of the APX 1-CE. All tanks were fitted with an ER 52 radio, which would read and transmit messages to all other vehicles of the unit. Those radio had a very limited range, with a mere 2km for the ER 52 and 3km for the ER 52Bis that were fitted on platoon command tanks, but at least gave the D2 the capacity to communicate among themselves more efficiently than other French tanks. De Gaulle was also known to have been one of the French\u2019s army best armor tacticians of the late interwar and 1940, and while he left command of the 507th Regiment three days before the start of the campaign (to become the commander of the newly formed 4th DcR/4th Armored Division, a hastly formed armored division which ended up being the one that launched the most counter-offensives against the German breakthrough of Sedan), he left behind him an impeccably drilled and trained regiment. Sadly for the 507th though, it only had SA 34 armed D2, as the SA 35-armed ones only left their factories during the campaign and were generally delivered to new hastly formed units. The D2 would generally have been a fair bit weaker than the S35, which had a somewhat thicker armor, better mobility, and better ergonomy leading to an higher rate of fire and better situationnal awareness; it still remained, however, one of the more efficient French tanks if armed with the SA 35 gun.  The B1 and B1 Bis have a long development history. Their designing process is not something which, as most other French vehicles, starting in the early or middle 1930s - it goes back all the way to the Char de bataille programm of 1921. The idea would be to design a breakthrough tank armed with an hull-mounted 75mm howitzer and able cross trenches and knock out enemy fortifications. Five different firms were asked to produce prototypes, the idea being to then combine the best elements of each of those into a single tank. Four prototypes were produced in 1924, one by FCM, one by FAMH, and two which were Schneider and Renault cooperations. After those were completed, an extensive process of designing took place, enlarging and modernizing the design and re-designing the armor layout and hull. The vehicle was mostly based on one of the Schneider-Renault design, but still incorporated elements from each design, and as such no firm was the sole designer of it. The first prototype was finished in 1929, two others following in the following years; they were all fitted with 40mm of frontal armor and various turrets that featured either one or two 7.5mm machine-gun. A design was finally agreed one and adopted in March of 1934, a decade after the original Char de Bataille prototypes. The resulting B1 was a long (6.37m) but not wide (2.50m) design, a result of the vehicle being designed to cross trenches - it could cross a 2.75m wide one - . It had 40mm of all-around armor, the front being notably sloped. The machine-gun turret had been ditched for an APX 1, mounting, as on the first series of D2, a 47mm SA 34 gun as well as a coaxial MAC 31. The turret was off to the left of the vehicle: in the right side of the hull, the B1 featured a 75mm ABS mle 1929 gun. The main purpose of this gun was to destroy enemy positions and fortifications, and as such it being unable to traverse separately from the vehicle, with litterally no horizontal movement, was not seen as a problem. It fired 75x241mmR shells, which, for the HE shells, had an explosive charge of 740 gramms and a muzzle velocity of 500 m/s. Anti-tank APHE shells were also provided, which had an armor penetration in line with the 47mm SA 35 with 40mm/30\u00b0 at 400m, but included an explosive charge of 90 gramms. With a muzzle velocity of 475 m/s and no horizontal traverse, their use remained very situational. A 7.5mm MAC 31 machine-gun was also placed in the hull. To operate this varied armament, the B1 had a crew of four: a commander/gunner/loader in the turret, a pilot and gunner for the 75mm as well as a copilot/loader and radio in the hull. All vehicles were fitted with the ER 53, which, in theory, was quite capable, with a range of 15km, but in practice, proved very unreliable and problematic. The engine was a 6-cylinders 272hp Renault gasoline engine which gave the tank a maximum speed of 28 km/h. The tank was about 27 tons in combat conditions.  The B1 \u201cVerdun\u201d on parade, 14th of July 1937, Paris. Just 34 B1 were ever made, 32 being newly-produced one and two others being prototype modified to operational standards. Deliveries occured in 1936\u20131937. They were actually refitted with 47mm SA 35 instead of SA 34 in 1939. In 1936, production switched to an improved version, the famous B1 Bis. In comparison to the original B1, the B1 Bis had its frontal armor raised to 60mm, and side armor raised to 55mm. The 47mm SA 34 was from the get go replaced with the SA 35. The raise in armor thickness led to the vehicle\u2019s weight reaching 31.5 tons, but the B1 Bis used an upgraded version of the original engine that produced about 300hp, leading to a similar maximum speed; however, with the same quantity of fuel, the B1 Bis had less autonomy, being able to run for 6 to 8 hours instead of 8 to 10 on the original B1. The vehicle was given a rather high priority by the French military, and about 370 would be finished by June of 1940; the B1 Bis and B1 served inside the infantry\u2019s breakthrough armored divisions, the DCRs, which normally had 80 B1/B1 Bis (alongside 80 R35) each. The B1 Bis was, in terms of pure armor and armament, quite the monster by 1940. With its 60mm frontal and 55mm side armor, it was, in combat condition, practically invulnerable from German 37mm anti-tank guns, may they be field guns or mounted in Panzer III, 35(t) and 38(t). While the HEAT ammunitions mounted in the short 75mm guns of the Panzer IV and StuG III could theorically knock it out, those required a good angle to go through; in practice, the only reliable weapons against the B1 in Germany\u2019s arsenal were the 88mm FlaK gun, and, to a more moderate extent, the Ju 87 Stuka. And indeed, the great armor and armament of the B1 Bis meant than in the hands of exceptionnal crews, they had exceptionnal results: Pierre Billotte, the particularly talented commander of the B1 Bis \u201cEure\u201d, managed to knock out two Panzer IV and eleven Panzer III as well as two PaK 36 anti-tank guns within minutes in the streets of the village of Stonne, on the 16th of May 1940. However, while the B1 Bis were able to perform exceptionnally well in some situations, such as in close range combat inside a village where they had little to do to spot an armored target, they still suffered from many flaws. As with all other French tanks, the commander was utterly overtasked - having to reload, entirely on his own unlike in the S35, fire the 47mm gun, but also spot enemy target, give orders to the rest of the crew and make tactical decisions. This meant that French crew were rarely able to make full use of the formidable armor and armament of their tanks, as their grasp on the situation was very often lacking. While the tank did feature a radio, it was very unreliable, and crews were far less trained to use it than in the Wehrmacht. And, at last, the B1 Bis suffered from a very mediocre reliability. It would very often break down and require repairs. While, in trench warfare, this would not be that big of a problem, as the frontlines moved slowly and sporadically, in the movement warfare that the Campaign of France was, this proved absolutely disastrous: crews were often forced to scuttle and abandon their B1 as repairs or recovery of the vehicles could not be performed quick enough to get the tanks back in operational conditions before German forces would be able to capture it. With the lack of decent logistics that plagued much of the campaign, many B1 Bis crews ended up being unable to find fuel for their tanks - there are a staggering amount of testimonies from the 1940 campaign of tank crew having to desesperately seek fuel - which once again led to the abandon of otherwise fully operational vehicles. Indeed, while it may have had the most guns and the thickest armor, I would go as far as saying that the Panzer IV and StuG III ended up being much more effective than the B1 Bis at both exploiting breakthroughs and supporting infantry. The B1 Bis was also very expensive and costly to produce, much more so than German medium tanks, and, in practice, it could be argued that it was in many ways a waste of resources.

The reconnaissance vehicles (AMR 33, AMR 35, AMD 35 Panhard 178): The cavalry\u2019s little wonders The recon vehicles employed by the French cavalry generally vastly differed from the other vehicles in the French army in terms of design, and even in terms of flaws they possessed. Unlike the infantry tanks, they weren\u2019t built to break through heavily fortified enemy lines in a WW1-inspired mindset, but were rather vast and nimble vehicles that were supposed to find holes in the enemy lines, report them to the high command, and, for the AMD 35, even harass the weaker elements of the enemy lines. After a number of various trials and experimental vehicles, in January of 1932, the French Army presented the firms of France\u2019s military-industrial complex with requirements for a recon cavalry vehicle. They wanted a 3.5 tons vehicle, with 9mm of armor (raised to 13mm in December), a speed of at least 35 km/h, and a 7.5mm machine-gun as armament. While many would answer to those requirements with a wheeled vehicle, Renault decided to instead concentrate on a tracked proposal which, in the firm\u2019s internal naming system, was designated Renault VM. The vehicle was loosely based on Renault UE, a small logistical tankette created in the wake of the Carden-Loyd and which was considered for the development of a recon vehicle. The VM was only loosely based on the UE though, and ended up with different suspensions, and an hull which had little in common with the earlier Renault design.  The AMR 33 Renault VM: a tiny, lightly armed, lightly armored vehicle, the AMR 33 was nonetheless considered by its crew as a good reconnaissance vehicle, and is arguably one of the more successful children of the Carden-Loyd tankette, albeilt one of the most distant as well. The VM was a tiny (3.50m long, 1.60m wide and 1.78m high) light tank/tankette, which featured 13mm of armor on the front and 9mm everywhere else: the vehicle was only intended to offer protection from machine-gun fire and shrapnels, and still used riveted construction. Its operational weight was higher than the programm\u2019s requirements, with five tons, but the AMR more than made up for it in mobility: with a Renault 8-cylinders 85hp engine, the tiny tracked vehicle had a power-to-weight ratio of about 17hp/t resulting in a maximum speed of 60 km/h that was, for the time, very impressive in a tracked vehicle. It had a range of 200km, which also was quite high for a French vehicle of the early 1930s. The vehicle was fitted with a small central turret, the Avis N\u00b01, which was fitted with a MAC 31 7.5mm machine-gun with 2,250 cartridges stored in the vehicle; a backup MAC 31 was also included, and could be mounted on the turret to serve in an anti-aircraft role. It had a two-men crew and lacked a radio. The development of the VM was surprisingly quick, with five prototype being completed by September of 1932 and extensively experimented on during the French army manoeuvers of the same month. The cavalry was very satisfied with the vehicle: despite being tracked, it was surprisingly fast, and offered a far better offroad mobility than a wheeled or half-tracked vehicle could. A first order was placed in March of 1933, and deliveries of the vehicle, AMR 33 (Automitrailleuse de Reconnaissance - Recon armored car) in French army nomenclature, quickly began the next year, for a total of 118 vehicles produced. Three of the prototypes were also modified to the standard of the production model, meaning a total of 121 operational AMR 33 were produced. The vehicle faced criticism for the placement of its engine though: placed on the center-right on the hull, it took a lot of internal space that could be used by the crew. Renault quickly answered those concerns by designing a new and improved AMR design, the ZT, which was finalized in February of 1934. It was lenghtened by 35cm, this additional lenght being used to push the engine towards the back of the vehicle. The suspensions were also considerably changed, and the vehicle received a new engine, a Renault 4-cylinders 82hp engine. It was somewhat heavier, with 6.5 tons, resulting in a reduced maximum speed of 55km/h which remained fairly impressive.  7.5mm-armed AMR 35 ZT-1 with their backup machine-gun deployed in an anti-air role. While this feature was present in a good number of French vehicles, it was, in practice, very rarely used. The first order for the Renault ZT, which went on to become the AMR 35, was placed in May of 1934. 167 vehicles of the main, machine-gun armed variant, the ZT-1, were produced. Interestingly enough, 80 of those received a new turret, the Avis N\u00b02, which was higher and was fitted with a 13.2mm Hotchkiss mle 1930 machine-gun with 1,220 rounds, giving the vehicle a rather nice upgrade in firepower (especially as, as with the AMR 33, a backup machine-gun was stored in the vehicle). The other 87 received the 7.5mm-armed Avis n\u00b01. Three variants of the AMR 35 were developed: the first two, the AMR-35 ZT-2 and ZT-3, were light tank destroyers, both armed with a 25mm SA 34 but the ZT-2 featuring a turret, while the ZT-3 had a casemate. Both also had a coaxial 7.5mm MAC 31 machine-gun. The 25mm SA 34, despite its small caliber, was a rather potent anti-tank weapon, notable for firing fast and accurate shells: it had a muzzle velocity of 950 m/s firing the 1934 AP Shell, which could penetrate 40mm/0\u00b0 at 500m and 32mm/35\u00b0 at 200m, making it fairly comparable to a 47mm SA 35, but with a quicker reload time as the shells were small (25x194mmR). Only ten of each of those models were produced, and they were distributed to serve as anti-tank coverage within a few AMR squadrons. The fourth variant, the ZT-4, was a colonial model, fitted with improved ventilation and engine cooling, and otherwise fitted with an Avis n\u00b01 turret (some were said to be supposed to be armed with an FT turret and its 37mm SA 18, but this was not apparently true). Those were being delivered during the campaign of France, and ended up being thrown into the chaos as stopgap vehicles, more often than not without a turret. 55 of those ZT-4 were produced.  German troops posing in front of a captured AMR 35 ZT\u00b01 fitted with the Avis n\u00b02 turret and the 13.2mm machine-gun. The heavier machine-gun did bring an appreciable firepower upgrade to the AMR, but it wasn\u2019t enough to turn a recon vehicle into a combat cavalry tank.  The AMR 35 ZT-2 was in theory a rather potent tank destroyer, but still suffered from the curse of the one-man turret that, while not too crippling when operating a machine-gun, really started to be when the guns stops to be automatic.  An abandoned AMR 35 ZT-3; this version traded the ZT-2\u2019s turret for a lower profile, albeit somewhat hindered by the cupola.  And AMR 35 ZT-4, recognizable thanks to its side ventilation and lack of turret. Originally intended for a strict reconnaissance role, the AMR were in the end distributed within the Dragons Port\u00e9s motorized infantry units and GRDI recon units. Despite their light armament and negligible armor, as well as lack of radio save for a few command AMR 35, they were generally well-liked by their crews who appreciated the good mobility on all terrains that made the vehicles a good reconnaissance platform. The French high command did not appreciate the vehicle though - while it was originally intended to be ordered in massive numbers for the cavalry, to be used in tandem with the heavier S35, orders were re-directed on the H35, ill-fitted for the cavalry\u2019s tasks, in 1936. While their thin armor and lack of armament made their combat capacities pretty negligible, the AMR could, especially if fitted with a radio, have proven effective recon vehicles. A recon vehicle which ended up being proven effective as well as not as lacking in punch as the AMR was the AMD 35. The AMD programm was formulated by the French Army in December of 1931: it called for a discovery automitrailleuse, which would be able not only to perform reconnaissance missions, but unlike the AMR, to also engage enemy units encountered. The requirements requested a 4.7 tons vehicle, armed with a 20mm gun and a 7.5mm machine-gun in a turret, able to reach 70 km/h on road but also to circulate offroad.  Panhard, perhaps the lead manufacturer of French armored cars in the 30s (and in the cold war too) answered to this programm with its AMD 178, of which the first prototype was presented in 1933. The vehicle was a 4.79m long four-wheels armored car, with a width of 2.01 meters and an height of 2.31. It had an armor of 20mm on the hull front, 15 to 20mm on the hull sides and rear, The turret, a two-seated APX 3, had a thickness of 26mm on the front and 15mm on the sides and rear. The vehicle had a crew of four: a forward driver, a backward driver, a commander and a gunner in the turret. The armament consisted in a 25mm SA 34 gun and a coaxial MAC 31 7.5mm machine-gun, with the usual backup weapon in the hull. The vehicle had a weight of 8.2 tons; it was powered by a Panhard 4-cylinders 105hp engine that gave it a forward speed of 72 km/h, which was fairly limited for an armored car, and a backward speed of 42 km/h. It had a range of 300km and was fitted with a radio, though it was reported to be rather unreliable. Deliveries of the Panhard 178 armored car started in February of 1937, and about 530 were constructed until the armistice. An unarmored command radio version was also produced, as well as a model fitted with a one-man turret and intended for Indochina (only four being produced). The Panhards were part of the cavalry\u2019s armored divisions, the DLM, each having 46 Panhard (two squadrons) in addition to its 160 tanks. The five DLCs, cavalry divisions, each had a squadron of 17 vehicles, and seven GRDI recon units had a 16-vehicles Panhard squadron. The Panhard was generally very well-liked for its crew, and out of all the vehicles fielded by France in 1940, it was one of the most potent. Its maximum speed was rather average, with 72 km/h, but the dual drive system used in the vehicle was a very powerful tool: the vehicle had four set of gears going forward, but another set of gears going backward, and with a dedicated backward driver, the Panhard could very quickly back away from a dangerous situation and remained manoeuvrable going in both directions. The vehicle\u2019s engine and drive were reported to be very silent, making the Panhard harder to notice for the enemy, though on the other hand, its brakes were very loud. The vehicle\u2019s main armament was able to go through the armor of about all vehicles fielded by the Wehrmacht in 1940, with the exception of the Panzer 38(t) ausf E that had 50mm of frontal armor, and the two-men turret crew meant the vehicle had way better ergonomics and gun operation than on other French vehicles: indeed, the AMD 35 was not only a good recon vehicle, but one that could engage and often win against German light and even medium tanks, something the French light tanks couldn\u2019t really claim. The Panhard was also reported to have a rather superb off-road mobility meaning it could easily get around even if a road was blocked or destroyed. The AMD 35 also had a splendid reliability, being known to very rarely suffer from mechanical problems and being overall one of the most reliable vehicles in the French Army\u2019s arsenal. The Panhard was not without flaws though, its radio being very vulnerable to any kind of shock, its armor lacking (as pretty much all wheeled vehicles of the war though, 20mm being far from the worst) and the internal space being rather cramped, The vehicle had an incredible potential though, and by 1940, the idea of giving it a larger turret armed with a 47mm SA 35 gun was being considered. While the solution was not yet adopted in May, in June of 1940, a Renault engineer, Joseph Restany, was able to conceive a proof-of-concept turret within 48 hours; the said turret was immediately mounted on an unused Panhard hull and went on to destroy two German Panzer IV, before being scuttled on the North side of the Loire to avoid capture. Restany would later design a 47mm-armed turret for the Vichy Regime\u2019s clandestine re-armament organization, the CDM. After the end of the war, another 47mm SA 35-armed turret was developed and mounted on the Panhard, producing the new Panhard 178B; a version armed with a short 75mm-gun was even designed postwar, though no prototype were ever made: unlike many French vehicles, the AMD 35 was very far from being a technological dead-end, and actually had a rather tremendous potential when it came to re-armament, meaning it could have been kept competitive for the duration of the war had France not fallen to the German onslaught.  Joseph Restany\u2019s Panhard 178, modified by the Renault engineer to mount a 47mm SA 35 guns. As early as this turret was conceived, more were ordered, the production of AMD 35 hulls being quicker than APX 3 turrets; only one would ever be made, though. V. Oddballs (W15 TCC, anti-tank Renault UE) While the French Army was mostly fitted with vehicles that had had rather long developments through the 1930s, the urgency of the situation in 1940 did lead to the creation of a number of stopgap tank destroyers which were sporadically used in the last weeks of the campaign, mating already existing vehicles with anti-tank guns.  The original Laffly W15 TCC prototype, fitted with an armored cabin and test in March and April of 1940. The Laffly W15 TCC was actually designed in early 1940, before the invasion of France and Benelux began: It was based on the Laffly W15 artillery tractor, which was fitted with an armored cabin and a rear-facing 47mm SA 37 anti-tank gun. That vehicle was actually rejected in the first days of May 1940, before the German attack began on the 10th, because of its high silhouette. On the 20th of May, struggling to realize the intensity of the incoming disaster, the French army quickly backpedalled and asked Laffly to immediatly mount 47mm SA 37 guns on Laffly W15 tractors, ditching the armor if needed to ensure a production as fast as possible. And fast, Laffly indeed was: On the 24th of May, a mere four days after the contract, a first battery of five operationnal Laffly W15 TCC left Laffly\u2019s facilities. The vehicle did not have an armored superstructure, but some armored plates from retired FT had been fitted around the cabin. Laffly was able to produce 70 vehicles until the end of the campaign, though only 61 would be armed: in less than a month, twelve 5-vehicles batteries were formed.  The Laffly W15 TCC as it was finally used, \u201cnude\u201d and used in ambush positions along roads and treelines. The Laffly W15 TCC was centered around its gun, the excellent 47mm SA 37. One of the very best anti-tank guns available in 1940, second only to the FlaK 88mm in power but with a far lower profile and higher rate of fire, the SA 37 fired larger, 45x380mmR rounds. Those had a muzzle velocity of 855 m/s and, on an unsloped plate, could penetrate 106mm at 100m, 89 at 500m 72 at 1km and 57 at 1.5km, making all German vehicles vulnerable to the French gun at pretty much all ranges. The gun was rear-facing, the intent being to park the vehicle in a treeline, the gun facing enemy lines, and to immediatly retreat after firing a shot. The vehicles of a battery were supposed to be placed in a staggered formation, the second vehicle being a few hundred meters behind the first ready to fire on any enemy tank that might pursue, while the first vehicle would in the meantime relocate further away and stand ready to fire on the vehicles that might pursue the vehicles that were now closer to the front within the battery. Using such tactics, the Laffly were occasionnally nasty surprises for German tankers, but being fielded in low numbers and long after the decisive phase of the campaign of France had been played out, their impact remained very limited - the vehicles themselves being vulnerable to basically any kind of fire, may it be from tanks, anti-tank guns, infantry weapons or an aircraft\u2019s bombs and machine-guns. Other vehicles created in the urgency of May and June of 1940 were armed versions of the Renault UE logistical tankette. A small, lightly armed tankette, meant to tow light anti-tank guns and mortars and deliver supplies to infantry regiments, the Renault UE was available in truly massive numbers, with more than 7,000 having being produced (making it by far the most produced tankette by 1940, though the Bren/Universal carrier would heavily outnumber it during WW2). The first created vehicle was a design created by the state workshop of AMX, which featured a small casemate armed with a MAC 31 7.5mm machine-gun, similar to a small number of vehicles (10) that had been sold to the government of Guangzhou in 1937. They kept the same very thin (9mm maximum) armor of the UE, as well as its average mobility, with a maximum speed of about 30km/h and an autonomy of just five hours. On the 25th of May, the French Direction of Infantry, by that point desesparate, ordered 1,500 of those casemates to be fitted on Renault UE. The number effectively produced is unknow, but way, way inferior,  An early 30s prototype of an armed Renault UE. I have not actually been able to find a photo of the AMX casemate, but it looked very similar to this one. Such vehicles were only stopgap designs created in the absolute urgency of 1940, and had little to no effective combat value. Later, on the 10th of June, a system allowing the UE to mount the 25mm SA 34 anti-tank gun was ordered by the French army, 150 being to be produced, though once again the actual number made is unknown. Those were already far more interesting than the machine-gun armed UE, creating what was essentially a mobile anti-tank gun, the SA 34 keeping its shield but being devoid of its carriage. While still very much a poor man\u2019s tank destroyer, it could at least have been somewhat useful as a stopgap anti-tank measure. All photos we have only show vehicles abandoned or re-used by German troops though, and the nature of the vehicle\u2019s service in the last days of the 1940 campaign is unknown.  The anti-tank Renault UE, while very much a stopgap measure, was already far more interesting than the machine-gun armed one. It is here being inspected by German soldiers after being abandoned by its users. VI. The antiquities (AMC Schneider P16, Renault D1, Renault FT) By 1940, the vehicles used by the French army on its frontline were almost exclusively modern vehicles that had been designed and produced in the 1930s. However, vast numbers of older, 1920s and even 1910s vehicles remained in use behind the frontlines, serving as training vehicles, tanks in North Africa, or measures against paratroopers on French airfields. The German breakthrough led to fighting way behind what France intended to be the frontline though, and as a result, many of those older designs had to face German frontline troops. The AMC Schneider P16 was the most modern of those antiquities. An AMC (Automitrailleuse de Combat - Combat Armored Car), the base design of the P16 was created by Citro\u00ebn, the French master of half-tracks, in the mid-1920s, but the development was switched over to Schneider, which designed the turret and had better production capacities, in 1926. Pre-series vehicles, fitted with a rather odd turret armed with a 37mm SA 18 on one side and a 8mm Hotchkiss machine-gun on another, were produced in 1928, four being made, while the main series of 96 vehicles were produced in 1930\u20131931 and had a different turret configuration. The P16 was a K\u00e9gresse-type half-track vehicle, a class of vehicles that was very popular in 1920s France. It was a long armored car, 4.81 meters in length, as well as a high one, with 2.47m, though it was not wide, with just 1.75m. The vehicle was very thinly armored, with a maximum of 11.5mm of armor, and despite the use of tracks had a weight of just 6.3 tons. It was powered by a Panhard 4-cylinders 50hp engine giving it a maximum speed of 47km/h; interestingly enough, as the later Panhard 178, it did feature a reverse drive with a whole set of gears. The rear-placed turret featured a 37mm SA 18 gun as well as a coaxial MAC 31 7.5mm machine-gun, the first use of this machine-gun that appeared in the early 30s.  The P16 had a three-men crew: a forward driver, a backward driver, and a commander/gunner/loader. The P16 actually played the odd role of the first combat cavalry tank in the cavalry\u2019s first armored division, the 1st DLM, a role in which it was replaced by the much more potent Somua S35 cavalry tank in 1937. The P16 was then reclassed from AMC to AMR, and delivered to few GRDI recon units. By May of 1940, its retirement in favor of Panhard 178/AMD 35s was about to happen, but was interrupted by the German attack which forced the French to use their old vehicles in combat. The P16 was, without surprise, completely obsolete against modern German armor; it suffered from the same one-man turret problem as French light tanks, but did not even benefit from their relatively thick armor, while its high profile and rather low mobility meant it was a splendid target for German guns. The Renault D1 was, on its side, an infantry tank derived from the previous NC, itself a derivate of the FT using different suspensions. With a vastly widened and enlarged hull, the D1\u2019s main feature was to introduce a third crew member, a radio - indeed, the D1 was one of the rare French tanks to have standard-issue radio, the same ER 52 as the D2. A transition vehicle, adopted in October of 1929 and delivered from 1931 to 1935, the D1 was in many ways an enlarged FT.  The Renault D1 as they first left their factory, still fitted with the old Berliet turret of the Renault FT and its anemic 37mm SA 18. The tank had a lenght of 4.71m, a width of 2.18 and an height of 2.50 with the definitive turret. It was one of the first French tanks to incorporate a rather thick armor, its 30mm being rather impressive in the early 30s, though the vehicle still used riveted construction. The tank had a weight of 14 tons in battle order. It was powered by a Renault 4-cylinders 74hp engine, giving it a maximum speed of 18.5 km/h and a range of 120km. The D1 was notable for having a rocky turret development. When the first vehicles left their factories in the autumn of 1931, the ST1 turret was still not ready, and they had to be fitted with FT turrets. Only six ST1 turrets were ever produced, the design proving unsatisfactory and poorly balanced, while at the same time 160 D1 were constructed; the definitive turret, the ST2, while designed in 1933, would only be mass-produced and retro-actively fitted on D1s from 1936 onward, at a point when the vehicle was growing obsolescent. With the ST2, the D1 was armed with the 47mm SA 34 short gun, and a coaxial 7.5mm MAC 31 machine-gun; it also was one of the very rare French tanks to have an hull machine-gun, another MAC 31. In the late 30s, as the heavier D2 and B1 Bis replaced them, all D1 were sent to North Africa, and particularly Tunisia: while obsolete against new German designs, they were far from being outclassed by Italian L3 and M11/39 tanks. Three battalions of D1 were in Tunisia by May of 1940, but in June of 1940, one of them, the 67th, was quickly relocated to Metropolitan France in a desesparate effort to try and slow down German advance. Unsurprisingly enough, the D1 did not fare well: its only true strongpoint was having a very short-ranged radio, and the old 47mm SA 34 proved absolutely pitiful when dealing with a target with any kind of armor. The D1 was known to, even more than other French tanks, have particularly bad vision; coupled with the now common one-man turret problem, the tank crew had a just terrible awareness of the battlefield in general, and often ended up clueless. The old and tired engines and transmissions of the D1s also proved very unreliable, and it is reported that the 67th tank battalion actually lost the entirity of its fleet of 43 D1 from the 12th of June, when it was first engaged, to the end of the campaign.  A knocked out D1 in 1940. While an interesting transition tank designed between basically WW1 design such as the FT and NC and true, modern designs such as the D2 and B1, the D1 was nonetheless absolutely obsolete by 1940. Even older than the D1, and far more common, were the now ancient, WW1 relics that were the Renault FT. Conceived as a light tank to operate alongside the infantry and be used in massive numbers against enemy fortifications, the FT was the first tank to sport a fully rotatable turret, and was one of the most significant breakthroughs as tank designs as well as the most produced armored vehicle of WW1, more than 4,500 having been made by 1919. While hundreds were exported or even phased out of service during the interwar, About 2,800 FT remained in the French army by 1940 - A thousand had been refitted with MAC 31 7.5mm machine-guns, replacing the old 8mm Hotchkiss, in 1934 onwards, 800 were armed with 37mm SA 18 guns, and a thousand were unarmed. Those FT had been kept around to operate behind French lines. With its maximum speed of 8 km/h, its armor of 22mm at best and its light armament, the FT was outclassed for modern warfare, and the French Army was fully aware of that: however, it was thought that while they would be obsolete in the frontlines, the FTs would remain useful to protect strategical positions behind enemy lines; companies were notably used to protect airfields, where it was thought airborne attacks by enemy paratroopers were possible: with their machine-guns and light support guns, it was thought the FT would be rather able to pin lightly armed paratroopers in place and prevent the landing of planes with heavier equipment. FTs were also used to protect supply depots from potential enemy infiltration. A few reserve tank battalions still used FT in \u201ccalm\u201d areas of the front, such as behind the Maginot line, or, worse, the Ardennes forest, meaning some of the first tanks to counter-attack against German panzer-divisions, alongside the two FCM 36 battalions (that were also crushed), were Renault FT that were laughably unsuited for anti-tank warfare, or even modern warfare at all. FT continued to sporadically pop up during the campaign, often either when a reserve tank battalion attempted a desperate counter-attack or when supply depots and airfields were reached by the German advance. Needless to say, the resistance they could offer was at best symbolic, and when they engaged in combat, FT-equipped units suffered from some of the worst casualties rates in the entire French army, some tank battalions losing more than 70% of their combat personnel, not counting prisoners and wounded.  The 7.5mm-armed FT, sometimes designated FT-31, that had replaced the 8mm-armed tanks. While the 7.5mm was a better machine-gun than the old Hotchkiss, a slow, radio-less, poorly-armed machine-gun tank had no place anywhere near the frontlines by 1940. VII. Conclusion: the deep roots of a disaster The main point of this conclusion is going to be a very common one: it is that the French military high command, those who studied the use of tanks as well as made the requirements, lived in the past, the entirety of the infantry tanks being designed to fight a WW1-style conflict in which armor would be used to support infantry. While cavalry tanks were not as obsolete in doctrine, badly conceived requirements (outside of the AMR and particularly the AMD) made them barely better than their infantry equivalents However, in my eyes, the consequences of this very old mindset go much deeper than what most people tend to believe. Indeed, I have often seen argued that if French tanks had not been scattered in individual tank battalions and small (160 tanks in both DLM and DcR, Panzer-Division theorically had upward of 300 and even the least equipped at least 220+) tank divisions, but instead used in Panzer-Div style large tank divisions, France would have been able to not only withstand the shock, but even triumph against Germany, as their tanks were, in the eyes of those who support this argument, better than the Germans. The thing is, the infantry support doctrine of the French military had its root go far deeper than just the way French tanks were supposed to be used. It went into the tanks themselves. The requirements from which the engineers of France\u2019s military industry designed their tanks were deeply flawed. The light infantry tank ones were terrible, and considering how numerous those tanks were, their role was by far the most important one in the French army - and indeed, the very first part of this expos\u00e9 was also by far the most important one to understand how French tanks generally performed. The French\u2019s army insistance on having reduced crews extended past the light infantry tanks though, and even within cavalry and heavy infantry tanks. I find it particularly telling that the French tank with the most crew members (save for the 10 FCM 2C super-heavies which were scuttled and didn\u2019t fight), the B1 Bis, had just four crew member, while the German Panzer III and IV had five; and that despite the fact that the B1 was ten ton heavier and had two different guns act as its main armaments, two guns which would each require two to three crew members to be used optimally. The one-man turret curse that plagued about the entirety of France\u2019s armored fleet, save for the AMD 35 and the very mediocre AMC 35, just killed the tank\u2019s potential in mobile warfare - the most important crew member of the vehicle, the commander, being utterly overtasked already, would just not be able to properly co-ordinate with other branches of the military. The very design of the vast majority of French tanks contradicted modern warfare, and they were for most, seemingly unrecoverable; the B1 and S35 may perhaps have been salvaged thanks to their larger size, meaning a better evolution potential: while their immediate evolutions, in prototype stage by 1940, the B1 Ter and S40, did not fix the crew issue, there were plans - some drawn as late as June of 1940, taking lessons from the campaign itself- for more advanced models, such as the B40 which, in revised sketches of 1940, appeared to have sported a turreted 75mm gun. Some future tanks, such as the four-men crew, turreted 75mm-armed G1R medium tank (the first prototype being scheluded to be assembled in September of 1940), would also perhaps have solved most of the issue of the vehicles issued in the Spring of 1940. Still, for the vast majority of French armored vehicles, the only saving grace would have been to have had better requirements formulated before work on the design began. Generally, the French army of 1940 was only superior to the Wehrmacht in the minds of those who had been stuck in 1918. Even in numbers, the French armor, even with the British, Belgian and Dutch divisions, was outnumbered by the Wehrmacht, with 124 Allied divisions (and that\u2019s couting 22 very under-strenght Belgian divisions) facing 132 German ones during the 1940 campaign; the Germans having the advantage of all being in the same army, co-ordination being way easier than between the allies and particularly the Franco-British and the Benelux. German divisions were also, on-average, equipped with far more modern equipment even when it came to infantry weapons, with the only true good point of the French army\u2019s material in my eyes being anti-tank guns and the new but rare MAS 36 rifle. While the Wehrmacht\u2019s victory against the occidental allies has often being presented as a David vs Goliath scenario to demonstrate how shocking for the world the vanquishing of France was, I am personally of the opinion that the Goliath was German, and won.  De Gaulle as the commander of the 507th RCC, Metz, 1937. The armored warfare doctrine of France was opposed by a number of French military theorists, of which one of the most influential and famous was Charles De Gaulle. However, by the time he managed to reach an influential position, in May-June of 1940, it was way too late to re-organize the French Military. The division De Gaulle commanded in May, the 4th DCR, is often said to have been the most well-commanded and succesful allied division of the campaign though, despite having been very hastly equipped in the torment of the first days of the German invasion. A note to the quora users that have been translating my answers in French: I want to really thank you guys for your translations; I have neither time or dedicating to translate myself, and your great translations have been very useful in bringing what I write to my own country\u2019s public. However, this answer is a bit special, as it is perhaps the one I put the most work into ever - therefore, I\u2019d like to translate it in French myself. Thank you in advance for your understanding.
