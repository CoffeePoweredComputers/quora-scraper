            "answer_text": "Reposting from Evan Rodick's answer to What denomination of church would an early Christian most likely identify with? Orthodox ChristianityThis can be determined based on three main forms of evidence: Continuity of Ministry: Apostolic SuccessionApostolic succession is important because it shows the important link with the early Church. In Acts 14:23 we see Paul and Barnabas \"had appointed elders in every church, and prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.\" The apostles handed down the powers of the office of bishop that Jesus originally gave to them, \"the keys of the kingdom of heaven\" and the power to loose and to bind (Matthew 16:19). It's important that this line of succession continues even down to the present day because \"the gates of Hades shall not prevail against [Christ's Church]\" (Matthew 16:18). If there was ever a time when this line had been broken, it would mean that the Church had for a time indeed been overcome, making Christ a liar. Yet we see that Apostolic Succession has been continuous from the very beginning in the Orthodox Church. This would be a vital signal for an early Christian looking for the true Church since even as early as 182-188 AD St. Irenaeus gave the line of bishops of Rome to Eleutherius and said \"In this order, and by this succession, the ecclesiastical tradition from the apostles, and the preaching of the truth, have come down to us\" (Against Heresies, Volume 1, Book III). 2. Continuity of Beliefs: Correct Doctrines Apostolic succession means nothing without a continuity of faith. Roman Catholicism, the other main claimant of apostolic succession, has changed its faith by introducing new doctrines that are inconsistent with the Scriptures and the Church Fathers (the Filioque, Purgatory, Original Sin, Immaculate Conception of Mary, Papal Infallibility, Created Grace, etc.). While some accuse the Orthodox Church of changing the Faith, it can be shown that Orthodoxy never actually changed anything, just explained what Christians have always believed in order to fight heresy, for instance, in the case of the doctrine of the Trinity--as I discuss in another answer. The Church is \"of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth\" (1 Tim 3:15). It is the Body of Christ, and Christ is \"is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Do not be carried about with various and strange doctrines\" (Hebrews 13:8, 9). The Orthodox Church has defended the timeless truth God has given us throughout the ages and, in fact, took the name Orthodox meaning \"straight teaching\" or \"true faith\" in order to distinguish itself from the many other churches that had fallen away from the faith of the apostles. This again would be important to an early Christian as St. Polycarp, disciple of St. John the Evangelist, said in 110-140 AD \"forsaking the vanity of many, and their false doctrines, let us return to the word which has been handed down to us from the beginning\" (Epistle of Polycarp to the Phillipians, Ch. 7). 3. Continuity of Worship: The Divine Services The Orthodox Church celebrates primarily the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, which dates back to the 5th century. On certain occasions we also celebrate the slightly older liturgy of St. Basil. The liturgy of St. James is the oldest liturgy, often attributed to St. James, the brother of the Lord, but probably written down by St. Cyril of Jerusalem around 370 AD. They are all similar in structure and are basically a formalization of the way Christians had been practicing from the beginning, centering on the Eucharist. Remember, Christianity is the fulfillment of Judaism and many of the first Christians were Jews, so it is very likely that the early Christians incorporated Jewish practices into their worship (transformed in the light of Christ, of course). For instance, they still prayed at special times: \"Now Peter and John went up together to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour\" (Acts 3:1). They prayed prescribed prayers such as the Psalms and the Our Father, as Jesus had taught them (Matthew 6:9, Luke 11:2). They also prayed in the temple, and began to pray in Christian's houses. Eventually they moved to dedicated churches which resembled Jewish temples in certain relevant symbolic ways. For a comparison, in Hebrews 9:2-9 St. Paul tells us \"For a tabernacle was prepared: the first part, in which was the lampstand, the table, and the showbread, which is called the sanctuary; and behind the second veil, the part of the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of All, which had the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which were the golden pot that had the manna, Aaron\u2019s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant; and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat.\" Now take a look at an Orthodox Church's altar:  (Image Source)  You don't have to take my word for any of this.

            "answer_text": "Yes- I say yes since it depends on how you look at it. First- before the schism of 1054 and the first Ecumenical Council for that matter several distinct rites were forming. Which lead to the 5 patriarchates In the period after the fall of the Western Roman Empire- the seeds of the schism of 1054 were being planted. The most noticeable issues which divide us - primacy, and ordaining married men were popping up here. For the Eastern Church- all Bishops were and are equal-and a primate like a patriarch just presides over meetings and gets listed first. While a host of issues lead the Popes of Rome to see themselves as more than the first among equals. So the Patriarch of Rome was closer and moving closer to the modern Catholic church. ",
