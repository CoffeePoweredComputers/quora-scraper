            "answer_text": "It is not. We liberals think that only a liberal society can thrive. But Roman and Han empires thrived for centuries without liberalization. Mughal kingdom too! But, ultimately, you have to ask this question - is allowing people to do what they think is important/best (as long as they are not actually hurting others) a better way to run the society? We had slavery for millennia but today few argue that having slaves is good. We had rigid social norms on what work men and women could do but only a small minority thinks that women engineers are useless (though I have met one of them) or men who sing and dance are effete. So, I guess ultimately liberalization is important because we want everyone to reach their utmost potential. We should not bar Blacks from playing baseball, women from becoming managers and doctors, men from becoming daycare providers, interracial and same-sex couples from getting married and setting up households, etc. Similarly, governments should not be dictating what business private companies should engage in (as long as they are not becoming a de facto monopoly).
