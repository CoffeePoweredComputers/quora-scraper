            "answer_text": "As the slickest country in Southeast Asia, as a Thai I am obliged to answer this using my own words. Because Thailand was right in the middle of colonization attempts by the British and French empires, AND WE WERE SLICK BASTARDS. (I\u2019m Thai, so I\u2019ll use \u201cwe\u201d when referring to Thailand/Siam.) After the first \u201cBurney Treaty\u201d establishing foundations of trade during Rama III (Nangklao), trade flourished like it used to be a generation ago (Ayutthaya Kingdom, which was previously sacked by the Burmese). Then came the colonization. Burma on the west got taken by Britain. The east side fell under French control. Siam (as Thailand was known back then) got sandwiched. In the next era, Rama IV (Mongkut), we got into a huge pickle after signing Bowring Treaty, named after Sir John Bowring. This gave many rights to the Brits, including extraterritorial rights, and the ability to own property even in Siam. Time to Upgrade. We basically thought, enough is enough. King Mongkut studied all in: the science: he became the first Thai astronomer to correctly calculate a solar eclipsethe spirituals: he founded the Dhammayut, known to be a Thai strict way of Buddhismthe arts: he promoted English education and personally hired multiple teachersand the way of the world: he decreed that the court should wear shirts in sessions, like the West.We continued to adopt Westerners among our ranks. Remember the Bowring guy? After great treatment and open-arms welcome, he eventually became our ambassador back to Europe. Another aspect of sophistication consisted of education reform, emancipation, and even taking a loan from the Brits to build a railroad. We shipped princes to study in Europe and see the world. Lose a Battle, Win a War.  We ceded a lot of territory for a lot of different reasons. We faced a lot of this during the time of Rama V (Chulalongkorn). Cessation of control over Laos: Damn French attacking us, and we learned dearly that our fleet was no match for theirs. After we lost to them, we were demanded two million francs, or \u201celse.\u201d This sum was too much for any one country at the time and not really expected to be paid: the French weren\u2019t after the money. What did we do? We PAID UP. Turns out the exorbitant sum asked by the French was actually doable. Both the government and individual nobles contributed gold, in exchange for the preservation of our freedom. The money, taking two generations (since Rama III) to amass, finally served its purpose of being the safety net of our kingdom. Cessation of control over Malaya: We traded that for the loan mentioned earlier. *EDIT NOTICE*: This section was edited for better scope and wording. Since the scope of territories under the Siamese sphere of influence was rather limited and most were tributary, not annexation, I have modified the scope and extent of territorial controls to reflect this. I apologize for the inconvenience. But the deal was tricky. The territory we used to control in those places were neither stable nor easy. Reportedly, and rumoredly, Malaya was highly different from the rest of the country in terms of culture. As for Laos, the area was unstable with banditry and rebellions. The upkeep was considerable. \u201cLosing\u201d those territories was a half-loss. The country became much easier to manage. Also, the deal came with cartography and stuff, to demarcate the borders. We earned our place in the world \u2026  World War I happened. Brits and French destabilized as they had to fight the Kaiser. We joined. We marched. We \u2026 somehow won. But most importantly, we used this moment to rewrite the treaties.  We weren\u2019t better than our Pacific neighbors in WWII, though. Despite efforts holding the beaches, Prime Minister, Field Marshal Phibunsongkhram wanted to collaborate with the Japanese. Then we lost our place in the world \u2026 This was when we were the closest to being colonized. Even though we did ally with Japanese and legally lost the second world war, we were exempt from the penalties. After all, the whole country was playing a huge game of good hand/bad hand \u2026  Hand 1: Playing with the Japanese.  Hand 2: Collaborating with the American and Chinese for the Allies. No matter which hand won, we won\u2019t really lose. How slick was that? \u2026 then we fought for it again.  How Cold War works. Fortunately Thailand did not fall.  General Westmoreland presenting medals to Thai soldiers during Vietnam War  Memorial for Thailand in Korean War These pictures should illustrate our participation in Cold War. We almost became just another domino, but didn\u2019t. So, why was Thailand never colonized? We modernized. We recognize that we should be a nation like the West, not a tribe to be colonized.We had safety nets. We stored enough money. The French didn\u2019t know we had that much.We know to participate in the world stage. Between WWI and Korean War, our active participation keeps paying off. We were never the strongest in the region, but (1) holding off is easier than advancing, and (2) the timing makes all the difference.We don\u2019t put all our eggs in one basket.We traded with multiple parties. British, French, Dutch, Chinese, American, Japanese, Russian, we trade with all. If we have many people on the same table, it\u2019s harder for one person to flip it. British and French don\u2019t want to fight each other directly, and NO ONE crosses the Russians. Ever. Napoleon and Hitler paid for that dearly.WWII was, like I said, a game of good hand and bad hand. Had the Japanese won or had the Brits and French not demanded the Northwest back, we might just have kept it.Today, many Shan state people individually identify with Thai culture. I\u2019m not claiming the land is Thai. I guess it\u2019s because of relief and humanitarian efforts led by Rama IX: If they need it, they get it.We are okay with foreigners and their customs.Back in Ayutthaya Kingdom era, we raised Constantine Phaulkon to a prime minister-level post because he was great, then struck him down because he turned out to be an asshole who wanted everything for himself. Then, in Bangkok times, we trusted Sir John Bowring because he showed exemplary skills. It\u2019s how we put people who know each other in key positions. If anyone crosses Siam, they also cross this British ambassador.We don\u2019t really care what religion you want to teach. Nowadays, a lot of great schools in Bangkok are Christian/Catholic. We just require (in the MoE curriculum) that all students are aware of Buddhism presence in the country, and know the customs around it. The colonial empires could not use religion as an excuse to colonize us.We hired tons of engineers to teach us to build new things. New Road (Charoenkrung), which today is a classical culture zone in inner Bangkok, was actually the first modern paved road we had. They can\u2019t say we are undeveloped. Again.We learned to love wearing shirts like the West, but it should be cotton and breathable! The tropics are too hot for suits.We know when to let it run loose. We decided to pay up to the French and concede territories to save the nation. We decided to concede lands instead of destabilize ourselves.And a pinch of miracle. Lady Luck sometimes smiled upon us, granting the extra dash of luck we needed.It\u2019s all why we maintained our sovereignty. POST-WIDE Edit Notice: I have changed some more words. As PART OF the world, I should have been more humble about my nation, not take pride of it. ",

            "answer_text": "It was because Thailand wasn\u2019t in the position for any European power to colonize without having an effect on another power. The reason was that although the French were able to colonize Cambodia and Vietnam in the beginning, they had to think many times, even making up excuses, to expand to Laos, which was a Thai vassal at that time, despite it bordering next to British Burma. From conducting navigation on the Mekong River, going through the Vietnamese royal library, and trying to suppress Vietnamese rebellions that were fleeing into Thai Laos gave the French excuse to force Thailand to give them Laos in 1893 and creating a 4.6 Kilometer demilitarized zone across the Thai territory on the Mekong River which is similar to the one that was given to the German on the Rhineland after WWI . It was documented that the British and the French was close in going to war despite the French annexation of Laos in 1893 and over a small Shan State on the Upper Mekong Valley, but was able to agree on a treaty in 1896 that both powers could gain sphere of influence on Thai regions and would not annex any further territories that are near their colonial empire and would equally divide that disputed Shan State into two pieces by which both the French and the British gained. Despite the French greed, they kinda back-stabbed the British by annexed more lands on behalf of Cambodia and Laos from 1902\u20131907 treaties by using the demilitarized zone as a way to negotiate with the Thai government while promoting irridentism in their colonies since they themselves long wanted to abolish which was officially did by 1904 and annex more lands. For the British, they decided to use economic strategic by offering Thailand loans to build the southern railway in exchange for Thailand ceding 4 southern Malay vassal states which became official in 1909. However, the French nor the British had an interest in controlling Thailand despite not wanting their colonies being close together since they were rivals. For Thailand, what made the country to avoid being colonized was opening relationship with other European powers that were arch rivals of the French and the British which were the German and the Russians by opening trade and sending Thai princes to those countries for study abroad; additional European advisers were hired in helping the Thai government in modernization. In territorial terms, the Thai government only ceded territories that consider to be far from Bangkok and doesn\u2019t have majority Thai population. The best example was the Franco-Siamese treaty 1907 which was done of the French desperate of \u201caccidentally\u201d annexed territories that the majority of the population was ethnic Thai for exchange of Battambang-Siem Reap which the majority of the population were ethnic Cambodian; although Thailand may have loss the fishing rights over the Cambodian lake of Tonle Sap, rich in large rice production, and Angkor Wat, but it was worth it since Thailand regained Thai citizens from French control since King Chulalongkorn knows that the lives of people are more important than the territories which is worth to cut the arm and legs of the nation just to preserve the independent heart. Therefore, Thailand ceded a territory worth 50,000 sq. km which was roughly the size of West Virginia just to only gained Rhode Island size 2,189 sq. km back . ",
