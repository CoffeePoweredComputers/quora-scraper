            "answer_text": "The Pantheon in Rome has been in continuous use since 117 AD and may be the oldest in use building. In any case it is very old. Commissioned by Marcus Agrippa during the reign of Augustus (27 BC \u2013 14 AD). The present building was completed by the emperor Hadrian and probably dedicated about 126 AD. He retained Agrippa's original inscription, which has confused its date of construction. The building is circular with a portico of large granite Corinthian columns (eight in the first rank and two groups of four behind) under a pediment. A rectangular vestibule links the porch to the rotunda, which is under a coffered concrete dome, with a central opening to the sky. Almost two thousand years after it was built, the Pantheon's dome is still the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome. The height to the opening and the diameter of the interior circle are the same, 43.3 meters (142 ft). It is one of the best-preserved of all Ancient Roman buildings. It has been in continuous use throughout its history, and since the 7th century, the Pantheon has been used as a church dedicated to \"St. Mary and the Martyrs\" but informally known as \"Santa Maria Rotonda\".
