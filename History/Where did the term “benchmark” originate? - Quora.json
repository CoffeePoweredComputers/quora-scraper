            "answer_text": "The original sense of \u201cbenchmark\u201d is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as \u201ca fixed point (esp. a cut or mark in a wall, building, etc.), used by a surveyor as a reference in measuring elevations,\u201d with this explanatory note: Typically, such a mark takes the form of a horizontal groove cut in a surface, into which the upper surface of an angle iron would once have been inserted, forming a level surface or \u2018bench\u2019 to support a levelling staff. In the UK, such marks, created by surveyors from the Ordnance Survey, are usually highlighted by a broad three-lined arrow cut immediately below the groove. The term is also applied to other types of marker that indicate a point of known elevation, such as plaques, rods, and pegs. The earliest usage dates from 1826, in a document relating to the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal. The original sense is still current: the OED also has an example from 2012, in a geoscience textbook. The more general sense of a point of reference or standard developed by 1884. The first usage related to computing is from 1959, so not long after the advent of computing itself. ",
