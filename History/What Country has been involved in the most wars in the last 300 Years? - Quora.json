The USA has been at war for its entire history.Since WW2 ?\u2026\u2026.constantly.Now ?\u2026\u2026\u2026..(quote) \u201cMultiple overseas simultaneous wars\u201d Supposedly there was 13 years after Vietnam where it didnt directly fight , but got others to do it for them , such as Indonesia, Cambodia , Iraq , Nicaragua and countless more. During those 13 years (and still today) it trained almost all of the death squads in Latin and South America , in The School of the Americas in Georgia.When they were exposed, they had to change their name and re-locate.The same Colonel who trained the Death Squads in El Salvador also replace civilian police in Iraq and took over Paramilitary Police training. Thats when Shia bodies started to be dumped in Sunni neighborhoods and vice versa.Thats when the Iraqi Civil War began. (in fact; the Civil War in Iraq was been covered in Western Media , when Iraqis themselves were baffled at what they were talking about. The asked \u201cWHAT CIVIL WAR?\u201d \u2026..but dont worry, it was being created by the US Special Ops and their trained Iraqi death squads who were just glad to have a paying job.) Just from 1950 to 2002 , it has conducted 200 separate military strikes.It is officially the Greatest Violator of World Peace.It is the Greatest Violator of the U.N Charter.It is the Greatest violator of International Law and Standing Treaties. The British at least paved the roads and built railways and schools.They did that to create infrastructure to better create wealth , but it DID benefit those countries in a weird disgusting way.The US policy is to destroy those things. When Saudi Arabia started getting annoyed at the continued , unecessary presence of US troops in its country , they were asked \u201cDid you notice what we did to Iraq ; hint hint ?\u201d For the British warfare and conquest was a means to stabilise and develop a country for Britains benefit. And a stable country was good for Britain.But the USAs policy is that War itself IS THE INDUSTRY, and the more missile and munitions they use , the more contracts for the boys and part time work for tax-payers.Even the Prisons main workload is manufacturing military equipment.TV and Medias main workload is to justify the violence and keep people paranoid. Do you know where Trump got the idea of ISIS crossing from Mexico ?Sicario.And the Government has a law now , that the DoD can create productions, movies, news, and documentaries with NO disclosure that it was created by them.So next time you watch a clip of Black Hawk Down ask yourself WHO supplied all those choppers and black hawks and wanted full editorial control in return ?
