            "answer_text": "Cleopatra and Julius Caesar had a son named Caesarion. He was the only biological son of Julius. Caesarion was denied relation by his father though most evidence points to him being his son, including the fact that he looked just like Julius. He also inhereted his epilepsy. He spent his early years in Rome where he was born, his mother a guest and lover of Julius. After Caesar's assassination, they quickly returned to Egypt. Caesarion then went on to become the last and final Pharaoh of Egypt. His rule did not last long though. Augustus, perhaps the most powerful and effective ruler in Rome\u2019s history, took note that Caesar had a now-teenaged bastard child who could claim heir to his throne (and, with public knowledge of his relation to Julius, be able to rally significant financial and military support to this claim). A particularly violent leader, Augustus would have none of it. He invaded Egypt, winning battles and slaying much of the Egyptian armies. This success is what brought the death of his rival Marc Antony (suicide by self-impalement) and Cleopatra (suicide by poisoning). Both were sure to die at the hands of Augustus either way. Months later, Augustus had 17-year-old Caesarian strangled by Augustus\u2019s personal guard, which in turn secured his own stranglehold on power in Rome. Roman leaders didn\u2019t fuck around. They were Game of Thrones characters in the flesh. An ancient sculpture of the Caesarion, the only child of Caesar, and final Pharoah of Egypt:  ",

            "answer_text": "Life Before Arabia.  The back door of a family home swings open, and a small boy bolts through the opening and out into the arms of nature, eyes wild with excitement. His name is Thomas Edward Lawrence. Still in short trousers, little Thomas runs out into the forest, ready to find adventure under every rock, in every bush and behind every tree. This secluded spot is his realm, one far from the disapproving whispers and sneers of Victorian society. His parents you see, are lovers. They fled Ireland drunk on guilt and excitement after their flirtation with adultery had been unravelled, and now they dare to live openly in sin with the children they bore. Victorian Britain is a hostile place for \u201cillegitimate\u201d children though. They\u2019ll come to no good, they\u2019ll say. There\u2019s no place for their kind, they\u2019ll whisper.  T.E. Lawrence (left), aged 25, with Leonard Woolley. (1913) How wrong could they be, though? Graduating from Oxford with First Class Honours, taking part in a prestigious dig at Carchemish with the likes of D.G. Hogarth and Leonard Woolley, and becoming fluent in multiple languages, there can be no doubt that Lawrence was in possession of a fine, and keen mind. Of course though, it would be the war years when his star would shine brightest, particularly after being sent out to join the Arab Revolt as a liaison officer, where he was tasked with keeping the rebellion alive and thriving. Their efforts climaxed with the successful ambush on Aqaba, turning the tides to the West\u2019s favour.  The great victory saw Lawrence return to the sceptred isle a hero, with King and country ready to decorate him for his efforts. It was bittersweet though; Lawrence set foot on British soil physically and mentally drained, with still one issue still on his mind. Arab independence. He was a fervent supporter of it, and pushed for the media to promote the cause whilst also refusing medals from the King in an act of protest. Alas it was for all for naught though, leaving Lawrence resentful. If that wasn\u2019t enough, he was also growing distinctly unhappy with his celebrity, wishing for a peaceful life away from the prying eyes of the public. He took up various pseudonyms in attempts to escape the press, though with their tenacity and tracking skill, they still managed to hound him for much of his remaining, short life. Within months of taking up early retirement and racing back from the local post office on his motorcycle, he lost control and crashed at high speed. A few days after being in intensive care, he died aged just forty-seven. Many notable figures attended his funeral, including Winston Churchill, who called him \u201cone of the greatest beings alive in this time\u201d. A brilliant mind and a heart that burned for adventure and knowledge; is it any wonder he achieved so much in such a short life? ",
