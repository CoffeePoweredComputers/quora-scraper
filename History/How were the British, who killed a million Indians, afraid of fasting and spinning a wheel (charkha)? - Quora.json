            "answer_text": "Because they were not afraid at all. Of course, Gandhi had done good work, but it worked in Africa. British weren\u2019t fools, who would leave Bharat just for sake of peaceful marching. No one will fear such activities. Gandhi wanted to do it peacefully, but failed to realize that British weren\u2019t humans, they were \u201cdemons\u201d who were ready to enslave the whole world at one point of time. Actually, Bharat got independence because of the following, Second World War(Britain was in billion dollar debts and unable to sustain so many territories)Rise in power by the USA and Soviet Union(Britain was, and will never be a superpower now)Netaji Bose\u2019s attempts(unfortunately unfinished),were threat to British.British Indian Naval mutiny, at erstwhile Bombay(Present day Mumbai, Maharashtra)Formation of the United Nations.UN was against colonial rule. Thus, Britain was forced to withdraw.Growing unrest due to unfulfilled promises after WW2Fear of possible civil war against British(deadlier than ever)This is what forced the British to withdraw. But, had they handed over power to people like Bose or Savarkar, Britain would have been ashamed of themselves.(As they were staunch enemies, and both of them had successfully escaped out of British prisons) Since Gandhi-Nehru pair was negationist, friends(slaves) of the British, and cowards who were unwilling to pick up weapons, British handed over the power to them.  Imagine if Bose was our PM, we would have been a military superpower very soon. That\u2019s what British had feared.  Upvote if found useful, Follow me to show appreciation of hard work done.
