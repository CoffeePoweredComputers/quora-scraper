            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no such thing as accurate version of history. History is written or recorded based on the writer\u2019s beliefs and point of view of the story he is writing. So I guess there\u2019s no one single country that has an accurate version of its history. Even in the same country, history is told differently based on whoever will be in power. I\u2019ll give you an example on how the same story could be told differently based on the country. So I\u2019m from Tunisia and in the 16th century there was a war in Tunis called the \u201cConquest of Tunis\u201d between Spain (along many other European legions) and the Ottoman empire. There were two conquests; the first Tunis was captured by George V of Spain in 1535, and the second it was captured by the Ottomans in 1574.  First conquest of Tunis by George V of Spain in 1535.  Second conquest of Tunis by the Ottomans in 1574. Before these two conquests Tunisia was ruled by a royal dynasty called the Hafisids. So one of the things I like when reading history is checking the different versions from all parties. In this example I found 3 versions from 3 different countries; Tunisia, Spain and Turkey! The Tunisian version is saying that Tunisia was independent and ruled by the Hafisids dynasty before 1535. It was an independent kingdom, somehow has nothing to do with the ongoing wars between the Ottomans and the Christians! But it got occupied by the Spaniards in 1535 as part of their Christian expansion in the region, then came the Ottomans and had a war with them and won and became the new occupier of Tunisia from 1574 installing a new dynasty! The Spanish version is saying that the Tunisian king of the Hafisid dynasty feared that the Ottomans will occupy Tunisia, so he asked the help of the Spanish king to protect his thrown. The Spaniards came and installed in Tunis and fought the Ottomans in 1535 and won. Then the Ottomans came back and launched a war against them in Tunis in 1574, they won and seized Tunis! The Turkish version is saying that Tunisia was part of the Ottoman empire from the beginning and got occupied by the Spaniards in 1535, and it was the Ottomans duty to liberate it, so they launch a war on the Spaniards in Tunis and got Tunisia back in 1574! Which version of these stories is the accurate one? We can\u2019t tell! You can choose one that fits your beliefs, or keep a distance and don\u2019t side with any of them! ",

            "answer_text": "The most untrue history rehearsals and camouflage activity is about Soviet Union. Just starting from personal experience of being taught in Soviet school. We have been taught of absence of any Gulag, Communist government is most human in the world, USSR was on defense in WWII against Germany with attention to Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement as defensive one, Stalin was negotiating peace just to try to re-schedule inevitable war, etc. There were some repressions but mostly about hundred or so political opponents and army generals. Then suddenly, Perestroyka and Glasnost came out. More facts about mostly Stalin times were starting to come up. After fall of Soviet Union and chaos of 90s in all post-Soviet countries many government archives become open. People started to speak freely about \u2018accomplishments\u2019 of Soviet Union. There were newspapers, magazines, books issued and freely discussing the whole shit about USSR. It came out that the whole history of Soviet Union was false, fabricated lie. Suddenly, after Putin came to power, a process or reversing back to life all that \u2018good staff\u2019 about USSR become clear and very persistent. Nowadays, it is still some degree of free of speech and discussions about USSR. Yet, there are strong trend of finding of excuses for what Stalin did. Propaganda on Russian media is clear especially with regard to Ukraine. People are told that : (Putin\u2019s words) Russia and Russians could have won WWII without any support from other Republics of USSR (not speaking about the West), Ukrainians were collaborators to fascist (BTW over 1.6 millions of them died fighting Nazi Germany)number of Gulag and Holodomor victims are exaggeratedinfamous 1938 Munich agreement is a plot leading to UK, France being behind WWII initiators while Molotov-Ribbentrop was on defensive strategic smart move to prevent expansion of Nazi or prevent WWII, etc.dissolution of USSR is great plague of the 20th century, etc.Stalin did take USSR with a spade, and left it with Atomic bomb (which is true but the cost of such conversion from agro to industrial was bloodiest transformation in the world\u2019s history)Gorbachev is a traitor; Yeltsin\u2019s time of rulership in post-soviet Russia is most dark and shameful period in modern Russian history, while Putin\u2019s presidency is period of \u2018standing up from knees\u2019 (I wrote some posts against such opinion here Darren Kowalski's answer to Many Russians say the 90s were bad until Putin was bad until he was in office. Why was the 1990s bad for Russia? and here: Darren Kowalski's answer to How did Gorbachev's reforms lead to the breakup of the USSR? How could the totalitarian systems that had existed for 60+ years without fail collapse through the work of one man?It is only small part of propaganda current official Russian media disseminates to people. This reverse back process of rehabilitation of USSR is clear and dangerous giving new motivation to people to repeat history. ",

The people who are probably the most honest about their history are the ones whose history does not contain any shameful periods of exploitation\u2014or they were a very long time ago. I would guess that Iceland and Norway have little reason to lie or distort their history. ",

            "answer_text": "The ancient history of China is recorded in the most accurate way, which is mainly formed by two traditions. The first tradition is that historians treat death with impunity.The most obvious examples are Dong Hu's record of Zhao Dun's regicide and Cui Zhu's record of regicide. In order to record the true history, historians did not fear that their whole families would be killed. The second tradition is to compile the history of the previous dynasty by the later dynasty.Since the later dynasty was often the enemy of the previous dynasty, they did not make much of the history of the previous dynasty.For example, the Yuan dynasty edited the history of song, Liao and Jin, while the Ming Dynasty edited the history of Yuan.

            "answer_text": "History isn\u2019t something monolithic like monotheistic religions. History has a very wide variety of sources. Nations have specific agendas, which is to turn out useful, rule abiding patriots. This is done by controlling the high school history agenda, which is done by state boards (highly influenced by Parent Teacher Associations), religious pressure groups, and capitalist propaganda (keep out the history of labor movements). However, the state (at least in the West) can\u2019t control college level history courses, and once you get to that point, you realize that even if the victors write the history, the losers edit it. That\u2019s not a cynical statement, what I mean is that the sources can\u2019t be completely controlled. Thus an American history of the Revolutionary War will say things that a French history might not or which might expand upon. History is self correcting, in the long run. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, nowadays, it is a matter of following modern scientific principles in historiography, in the context of true academic freedom and a well formed university system. It is important to distinguish several different things, for example : the production of professional historians, who have got university qualifications and degrees ; what we call in French and in France la M\u00e9moire - the way the people and the State remember their history, which includes sentimentality and subjectivity ; the production of amateur historians or politically or philosophically oriented people, who don\u2019t follow academic principles (or not all of them). There is also a very important facet : the teaching of history in primary and secondary education. In a country like France, nowadays, the programs must conform themselves with the discoveries and advances of research. However, these programs are also linked to the lessons about civic and moral education, and thus to the m\u00e9moire. However, the time of oriented history and roman national in primary or secondary schools are things of the past at school (as of now). ",
