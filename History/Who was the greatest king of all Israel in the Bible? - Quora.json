            "answer_text": "Original question: Who was the greatest king of all Israel in the Bible? King David, son of Jesse, from the tribe of Judah is the benchmark that God used in reference to other kings of a united kingdom of Israel, and later on the separated Kingdom of Judah, would most likely be the greatest king of the Hebrews in the Bible. From a humble beginning, David began his ascent to the throne in the way that is right in the eyes of God. During his reign, he had committed a couple of grave misdeeds but he turned away from the error of his ways, making amends with God and returning under God\u2019s good graces. In David\u2019s last days as king, he remained faithful and loyal to God that God considered him \u201ca man after God\u2019s own heart.\u201d (Read: 1 Samuel 13:14) No other king of Israel and Judah had achieved this title. In the history of the kings of the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah, God and His prophets who wrote the Books of Kings and the Books of Chronicles always indicated the performance of other kings of Israel and Judah in reference to King David, saying \u201c[name of king] did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did not follow the LORD fully, as David his father had done.\u201d This shows that God used King David as the benchmark or the gold standard in measuring the career performance and royal standings of other kings after David. God also blessed David to have \u201ca great name, like the names of the great men who are on the earth\u201d (Read: 1 Samuel 7:9) that in modern times, the name \u201cDavid\u201d and King David himself is as famous as other popular names and historical figures in the world. In a nutshell, King David started his reign right with God, received great blessings from God, and finished his term right with God. So, he became the greatest king of all Israel. That\u2019s my take. ",

            "answer_text": "Our greatest monarch was King David, hands down. 1) He authored/compiled the book of Psalms and gave it to us in its present form (Talmud, Bava Batra 14b). The Psalms (Tehillim), which we might call the soul of the Jewish people, express the yearning of King David and of the entire nation to be close to God. They are one of the foundations of our prayerbook to this day.2) King David was the one who finally succeeded in subduing all of the surrounding nations (see 2 Samuel ch.8 and ch.10) plus the entire territory of Israel, something which no one else did previously or subsequently. He succeeded in all his endeavors (1 Samuel 16:18).3) He secured from the prophet Nathan a promise from God that his (David's) son Solomon would build the Holy Temple (2 Samuel ch.7). The First Temple is actually considered the accomplishment of David himself (Rashi commentary, Berakhot 18a), since it existed in his merit (\"Torat Chaim,\" commenting on Talmud, Shabbat 30a).4) He set the blueprints, with Divine inspiration, for the Holy Temple (1 Chronicles 28:19). Together with the prophet Samuel, he located the spot where the Temple would be built (Talmud, Zevachim 54b); and he dug the foundations for the Temple (Talmud, Sukkah 53a).5) He amassed vast amounts of material and precious metals for the construction of the Temple (1 Chronicles ch.29).6) Together with Samuel, he instituted the 24 groupings of families of Kohanim and Levites (Talmud, Taanit 27a).7) He served God all the days of his life (1 Kings 11:38); and God was with him (1 Samuel 16:18).8) He was without peer in clarifying and applying the halakhot (laws) of the Oral Tradition (Talmud, Sanhedrin 93b).9) King David serves as the archetype of the effectiveness of repentance (Talmud, Avodah Zarah 4b).(Proper attribution: I originally posted this answer of mine or parts of it, on Answerscom.)
