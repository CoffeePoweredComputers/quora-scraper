            "answer_text": "The etymology of skippy and thus damn skippy in this adjectival form continues to defeat research. It has no links to the primary noun uses, which refer either to an effeminate man, a white Australian child (based on the popular TV character \u2018Skippy the Kangaroo\u2019) or as a variant of skibby, an East Asian prostitute and thus used as a derogatory name for any East Asian. The only possible link may be with skippy, meaning an energetic person; however the use of this seems only to emerge - on some US campuses - nearly 30 years after damn skippy. The best I can manage is to provide the first couple of examples I have found, which if nothing else show that despite popular belief, the term long predates the 1990s:  1972 O. Hawkins Ghetto Sketches: \u2018Did you see that?\u2019 \u2018You damned skippy I saw it!\u2019 1983 R. Price The Breaks: \u2018You were great, Pie.\u2019 [...] \u2018Fuckin\u2019 A skippy, I was.\u2019 One other suggestion is a variation on the qually affirmative damn straight. My first record of this is also dated 1972, but in terms of semantic or indeed imagistic links, there seems to be little to offer. ",
