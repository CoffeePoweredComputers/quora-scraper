            "answer_text": "Short Answer: Yes, Huns were Turkic/T\u00fcrkic. illustrative Answer: \u201cThe Hun hordes ruled by Attila, who invaded and conquered much of Europe in the 5th century, might have been, at least partially, Turkic and descendants of the Xiongnu.[57][74][75] Some scholars regard the Huns as one of the earlier Turkic tribes, while others view them as Proto-Mongolian or Yeniseian in origin.[76][77] Linguistic studies by Otto Maenchen-Helfen and others have suggested that the language used by the Huns in Europe was too little documented to be classified. Nevertheless, many of the proper names used by Huns appear to be Turkic in origin.[78][79] In the 6th century, 400 years after the collapse of northern Xiongnu power in Inner Asia, the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks assumed leadership of the Turkic peoples. Formerly in the Xiongnu nomadic confederation, the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks inherited their traditions and administrative experience. From 552 to 745, G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk leadership united the nomadic Turkic tribes into the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk Empire on Mongolia and Cental Asia. The name derives from gok, \"blue\" or \"celestial\". Unlike its Xiongnu predecessor, the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk Khaganate had its temporary Khagans from the Ashina clan, who were subordinate to a sovereign authority controlled by a council of tribal chiefs. The Khaganate retained elements of its original animistic-shamanistic religion, that later envolved into Tengriism, although it received missionaries of Buddhist monks and practiced a syncretic religion. The G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks were the first Turkic people to write Old Turkic in a runic script, the Orkhon script. The Khaganate was also the first state known as \"Turk\". It eventually collapsed due to a series of dynastic conflicts, but many states and peoples later used the name \"Turk.\u201d -Wiki  All the information obtained to this point by the researchers showed that the Huns were of Turkic origin. We learn nearly all our current knowledge on the Huns from the information left to us by their contemporary neighbours. There are many words written in Chinese chronicles which were used by Huns in daily life. These are Turkic words. K Shiratoriy, reading a Hunnic sentence which has survived to the present day, has proven that it is Turkic. Hunnic-runic writings belonging to European Huns in Cafcasia [sic] has been read and has been proven to be of Turkic origin.  One area for backing up this claim is that of Hunnic names. It is difficult to explain the names belonging to Asian Huns because of fact that they were translated into Chinese in the form of Chinese names. The meanings of the names of European Huns can be comfortably explained in Turkish. One of the most striking features related to European Hunnic names is that they can't be explained by any language but Turkish. Some of the names belonged to the German language due to cultural interaction, but the majority of them were Turkish. Some similarities between T\u00fcrkic and Hunnic English Army Army Capture Country Girl Go Hunnic Orda S\u00fc/Su Tut- El Kiz Bar Common Turkic Orda/Ordu S\u00fc/Su Tut- El Kiz Bar/Var * Tengri also means \"God\" or \"Heaven\" in Mongolian. The differences between attributions to the Old T\u00fcrkic vs. Bulgarian T\u00fcrkic can't be dramatized. The Old T\u00fcrkic is no more a language than the Germanic language. Neither one does exist, they are only the terms of linguistic classification. German and English are Germanic languages, real and spoken, while the Germanic is not a language at all, it can't be spoken. The term Old T\u00fcrkic is a periodical classification of the written materials from numerous sources in numerous languages belonging to the T\u00fcrkic family and specifically of the Middle Age period. The Middle Age sources largely illuminate the languages of the neighboring Oguz branch, while the western (during Middle Ages) Ogur branch is represented by few accidental lexemes. They are identifiable by an anlaut consonant preceding the anlaut vowel of the Common (Oguz) T\u00fcrkic, i.e. they show up only in few available examples. The Chinese records there are practically absent from all dictionaries. A Swadesh analysis shows that basic lexical retention in the Oguz T\u00fcrkic languages vary from high 98% (Tatar - Kazakh) to low 75% (Turkish - Sakha), attesting to a great linguistic diversity. That analysis does not discriminate between the Ogur and Oguz forms, it only addresses the differences between languages. In all likelihood, in the European Hunnic state predominated the Oguric languages, with the Oguzic languages in demographical minority. With those caveats, both Fr.Altheim and O.Pritsak stated the same, the Hunnic and the Old T\u00fcrkic compilation were somewhat different realizations of the T\u00fcrkic linguistic family\u2026 Turks specific physical appearan(Generalization for West-East asian Turks can be diffrent for East-Siberian or North Asian - East European Turks.)  It appear that if the Huns spoke modern German, the Chinese used Roman alphabet and used a single moniker for the Huns, the European linguistic scholars would not have had any problems. Otherwise, the linguistic and demographic problems for their level of science seem to be insurmountable. \u201cThe migrants comprised war bands or tribes of 10,000 to 20,000 people, but in the course of 100 years they numbered not more than 750,000 in total, compared to an average 39.9 million population of the Roman Empire at that time. Although immigration was common throughout the time of the Roman Empire,[ the period in question was, in the 19th century, often defined as running from about the 5th to 8th centuries AD. The first migrations of peoples were made by Germanic tribes such as the Goths (including the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths), the Vandals, the Anglo-Saxons, the Lombards, the Suebi, the Frisii, the Jutes, the Burgundians, the Alemanni, the Scirii and the Franks; they were later pushed westward by the Huns, the Avars, the Slavs and the Bulgars. Huns and German tribes migration period (300 AD - 538 AD)  Later invasions\u2014such as the Viking, the Norman, the Varangian, the Hungarian, the Moorish, the Turkic and the Mongol\u2014also had significant effects (especially in North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, Anatolia and Central and Eastern Europe); however, they are usually considered outside the scope of the Migration Period.\u201d However, there are many names and captions belonging to Hunnish leaders which were written down in a document at Duro-Eropas, a border castle in Doma which was captured by the Persians in 260 BC. These names and captions are Turkish names and captions. Aramaic writing in present-day Georgia appeared in the period following the Huns' penetration into the Caucuses. This writing was also used by the Bulgars. It is estimated that this writing was proto-Turkic and appeared before the Orkhun inscriptions in Mongolia. As stated, many sources claim the Huns were of Mongol origin, since European Huns were somewhat mongoloid in appearance. Some historians also accept Turks as Mongols. All of these views are somewhat back-to-front. The Chinese annals say the Mongols always lived to the east of the lands in which the Huns dwelt. The Mongols originate from what is now known as Manchuria. The Mongol Empire was based on Turkic elements rather than Mongol elements. The governing structure of the empire was based on Turkic ideas of governing. The official language of the Mongol Empire was Uigrian, which is a Turkic language. Eighteen Turkish tribes played an important role in the founding of the Mongol Empire. There are many more examples that show the effects of Turkic elements on the Mongol Empire. For example, the Indian Moghal Empire was established by Turks. But many scholars still hold the belief that the Moghals were of Mongol origin. The truth is that the language of the Moghals was Turkic, and that the founders of this empire were proud of being Turk. You can come across many researchers who say the Huns are a nation whose origin is still mystery. .Haelfen-Manchen accepts that Asiatic Huns were in fact of Turkic origin and says that their language was also Turkic, but he raises an objection by adding that, in his view, European Huns are not descended from Asiatic Huns. I don't know the reason for it but many European researchers still seem not to accept that Attila's Huns were of Turkic stock. Another methodological peculiarity is the method of quibbles, where the the subject is reduced to \u201cjuggling\u201d the evidence and allow quibbles to bypass fundamentals. In a significant number of cases there is a clear impression of a certain presumptive ill will that did not allow to properly understand the essence. For example, Huns were scattered across Eurasia, there are western and eastern Huns, an assortment of the Indian Huns, Caucasus Huns, Yueban (Lesser) Huns, White (southern) Huns, and the \u201cPersian\u201d Huns, and probably more Huns that yet are to come to the limelight. G.Doerfer acknowledges only the Western and Eastern Huns, in asserted opposition, and argues to view them as unconnected entities, as ethnicities who donned an alien name. Applying the same level of conviction and meticulosity to the Germanic history would prove that Germans are not Germans at all, but some \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d mysterious entity, probably long extinct. The name Deutsch has nothing to do with the Germans, it is a Celtic word for \u201cpeople\u201d, \u201cnation\u201d, \u201cfolk\u201d, so it is either a derisive moniker for a generic \u201chuman mass\u201d, Cf. Sl. liudi, i.e. some human chattel, or an internalized borrowing from Celtic that has nothing to do with the German autonym, just like the alien moniker Chechen has nothing to do with the Nakh people. The alternate name German has a clear T\u00fcrkic origin, ger/her is an Ogur form of the Oguz T\u00fcrkic er \u201cman\u201d, german/erman literally means \u201cmanly, strong\u201d. In contrast, the situation is opposite of what G.Doerfer is advocating: Huns are the T\u00fcrkic Huns, i.e. Kins, and the Germans live with the Celtic and T\u00fcrkic exonyms. Such treatment of \u201cus\u201d vs. \u201cthem\u201d is beneath scientific objectivity. Funny, G.Doerfer generally displayed an independence of reasoning and objected to the veracity of consensus, but in this article one of the major arguments is the consensus. In the 19th c. a handshake between two august gurus could turn a hypothesis into a dogma, in the 1970s it had to take a consensus of the community. But the true evidence is the testimony of the facts, which outlive any consensuses. Hunnic Descendants The word \"Hun\" comes from the word \"kun\" in Turkish ...It means people, or nation. Many now accept that the Bulgars are the descendants of the Huns. The ancestor of the Bulgars is Kobrat Han, who was the son of Irnek. Irnek was the son or grandson of Attila. So the Bulgars are directly descended from the Huns. Their writings were a different version of the Turkish-Runic writing used in Mongolia. The Magyars (Hungarians) are also the descendants of the Huns (a false assumption, although Hungary itself did contain some Huns, plus Avars and many others - Ed). The dynasty of Arpad, which founded the present-day Hungary, is descended from the dynasty of Attila. The very name of the country comes from the name On-Ogur, which is a Turkish tribe. The Magyars consisted of six amalgamated Turkish tribes and one other Turkish tribe (a common fallacy which has largely been disproved, see the Magyar entry for details - Ed).  Magyars and Bulgars were accepted by the Byzantines as Turkic. for example, the Magyars were called Turks by the Byzantines during the ninth and twelfth centuries. Both of these tribes have since been assimilated into the native peoples in which they migrated and settled and have lost their own cultural features. There are still hundreds of Turkish words in the Hungarian language. I hope these few examples will help you in clarifying the origin of the Huns.  Along with 'Turks', Byzantine writers continued to call the Black Sea and Anatolian nomads 'Scythians' and 'Huns'  In Persia, Turks were marching in East. Turkic Khazars in northwest; Heraclius interfering in its affairs, Arabs making inroads into Mesopotamia. After the fall of Turkic Khazar empire, Turks became muslim fastly. A Turkish historian Professor \u0130lber Ortayl\u0131 and Turkish geologist Celal \u015eeng\u00f6r said Turks first origin place is East Siberia and Turks homeland is Middle Asia. They lost their identity fastly after the migrations.  While Turks were sometimes referred to as 'Sarmatians' in the 16th century, the term was generally reserved for the Russians.  For a time, the Seljuk Turks were also classified by the Byzantines as 'Huns'.  According to historian Peter Heather, \u201cWe do not know what language the Huns spoke and probably never will.\u201d Many believe Hunnic was a Turkic language. However, at the time of Hunnic expansion, this language family was restricted to Central and Eastern Asia. Scholars have attempted to analyze the Hunnic tongue through names of peoples, places, and tribes. However, most of these monikers come from a period where Germanic had become the lingua franca of the Huns. Chinese annals state that Hunnic was very similar to the language of the Toles, a Turkic tribe. Modern Chinese researchers define it as a \u201cproto-Altaic\u201d language. The Byzantines claimed that Hunnic was the same as the language of the Avars, Bulgars, and Szeklers, the latter of whom claim descent from European Huns. Others believe Slavic speakers are the true inheritors of Hunnic. The reality is that the Huns\u2019 enigmatic language is preserved across many Eurasian Steppe tongues.  (Picture is Raphael's The Meeting between Leo the Great and Attila depicts - Papa Leo I escorted by Saint Peter and Saint Paul, meeting with the Hunemperor outside Rome)  What is the mysterious \u201calmost\u201d? What is \u201cclear\u201d and which \u201cunclear\u201d are discarded? What calibrated scale is used to weigh the \u201cclear\u201d and \u201cunclear\u201d? These affectations sound more like a political pamphlet than reasoned conclusions. The *Bulgars* and *Suvars/Savirs* do not present a problem: Balkh and Water/River People respectively. The Bulgar noble and/or dynastic clans *Dulo, Ermi, Vokil (Uokil, Ukil), Ugain* are listed up to 762 AD, the Bulgar cardinals *vech, tut, beh, alt(i), chit(i), shekht, tovir*, and the Bulgar calendar years *Somor* Mouse, *Shegor* Bull, *Beren(i?)* Tiger, *Dv?a?nsh* Hare, *Vereni?* and *Samar* Dragon, *Dilom* Snake, *Teku (Tuki)* Mount, Horse, *Teku (Teke)* Sheep, *Dokhek(?)* Hen/Cock, *Dokhs(?)* Boar, are all listed in the \u201cNominalia\u201d Sherjere. The articulation *Dilom/Yilan* attests to the Ogur linguistic branch, the articulation *Vokil* vs. *Uokil/Ukil* attest to the typical Eastern European palatalization. *Attila* is a Dulo, and so is his posterity, no trace of Germanic whatsoever. There is no dead or living creature that doubts the T\u00fcrkic origin of these words and the tribal/clan names. We can clearly say Emperors were T\u00fcrkic.  Metehan is Father of Turks. Ottoman\u2019s historian says He is Oguz Kagan. China\u2019s historian says Metehan. Metehan was born in 234 BC. We don\u2019t know his place of birth. He sat throne in 209 TO 174 BC. He died in 174 BC. King Metehan\u2019s father is the founder of the Asian Hun Empire Teoman. Teoman thinks Meehan\u2019s stepbrother should sit throne. But Metehan and other people think Metehan should sit throne. Metehan sat throne because a lot of people supported him. But Yuezhi\u2019s kidnapped him. Teoman thinks methane escaped with Yuezhi. Teoman started a war against Metehan. Teoman did not see him because Metehan escaped. Metehan established the army. There were a thousand in the army. Metehan started a war against Teoman. Metehan won. Metehan killed his stepmother and father. He was king in 209 BC. Personal Names Among the Huns The linguistic classification of personal names has usually been coupled with postulated etymologies of the names. For example, Attila is classified as Gothic Germanic derived from att (father) and ila (a diminutive). Thus Attila means Little Father. But this is reminiscent of Ataturk (Father Turk), the title of Mustapha Kemal, the founder of the Republic of Turkey.  Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk(Father of the Turks) The acquisition of non-Hunnish names by Huns comes from the practice of the conquerors acquiring wives from among a conquered people. The offspring of these unions often acquired, at least in part, the language and cultures of the mothers. This makes the identification of the origin of any people problematic. We do have a physical description of Attila however. The envoy Priskos from Byzantium saw Attila and wrote down his description. Priskos' writings have not survived by a later historian Jordanes reported on those writings. Attila, according to Priskos, had a short, broad body with a large head. He had small, deep-set eyes with a darker complexion and a sparse beard. This description sounds more like the description of a Mongol than a Turk, or perhaps(very low probability) a Turco-Mongolian.

            "answer_text": "Rather limited or less educated people, and advocates of the \u201cnon-T\u00fcrkic origin theory of the Huns\u201d also often claim that \u201cthe Turks did not exist before the 6th century AD\u201d. But these arguments have been refuted by the known fact that names evolve and change, and the same folks during different eras are mentioned under different names. If in today\u2019s terminology, the linguistic family and ethnos are called \u2018T\u00fcrkic\u2019, they were called \u201cHun, Scythian, Tatar\u201d etc. during other periods. The main body of the T\u00fcrkic people consisted of \u2018Tele/Tiele\u2019 tribes, a confederation of nine T\u00fcrkic folks. The main body of the Huns consisted of Uigur tribes, and the modern descendants of the Tiele people are called the Turks. The first known records of the Turks are milleniums older than the modern notions of the linguistic family and the ethnos termed \u2018T\u00fcrkic\u2019. For instance, Ptolemy used \u201cHuns, Ases/Alans\u201d instead of \u201cN. Pontic Turks\u201d. Therefore, the Great Hunnic Empire was founded, and governed by the Turks. The first \u2018tanhu/khan\u2019 of the empire was Teoman/Tu-Man. He was succeeded by his son Mete/Mo-Tun. According to some theories, Mete and Oghuz Khan, the semi-mythological ancestor of the Turks, are the same persona.  The G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks considered themselves as the continuation of the Huns as well. The European Huns also emerged as a result of the migration movements following the collapse of the Hunnic Empire. Which means that Attila [the Hun], Teoman and Mete were the leaders of the same nation. The list of scholars who acknowledge that the Huns were T\u00fcrkic covers the whole alphabet : Altheim.. Bazin.. Bernshtam.. Chavannes.. Clauson.. de Guignes.. Eberhard.. Franke.. Grousset.. Gumilev.. Haussig.. Hirth.. Howorth.. Klaproth.. Krouse.. Lin Gan.. Loufer.. Marquart.. Ma Zhanshan.. McGovern.. Nemeth.. Parker.. Pelliot.. Pricak (Pritsak).. Radloff.. Remusat.. Roux.. Samolin.. Szasz.. and Wang Guowei. Chinese chronicles carry numerous statements on the linguistic and ethnological closeness or identity of the many Hunnic tribes. Among them are direct statements :  Weishi and Beishi say that the customs and language of Yueban Xiongnu were the same with the Gaoche ( \u2014 Gaoche/Chiele, Tiele/Tele T\u00fcrkic confederation, Yueban/weak Huns, meaning a lesser splinter of Hun massive \u2014 ) Beishi gives the ancestry legend of the Gaoche and links it with the Xiongnu [Huns]. Zhoushu and Beishi state that the \u201cTujue [T\u00fcrks-G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]\u201d were a branch of the Xiongnou. Suishu states that the ancestors of Tiele were descendants of Xiongnu. Xin Tangshu says that the ancestors of Huihe [Uigur] are the Xiongnu. The Eastern and Western Huns belonged to the Ogur linguistic family, the kin of Oghuz branch. Ogur is modestly called as the Karluk group today. In the antiquity, the Ogur family was much more visible than the Oghuz, due to their proximity to the literate southern populations. In addition, the Ogur group included Tochars, Kangars, Uigurs, Karluks, Bulgars, Khazars, Sabirs, Agathyrs and Avars. ",

They said same things about Sumerians, Medes and etc. Never mind them. We know nothing about the Huns. Even the word \u201cHun\u201d is an Iranian word, which means \u201cenemy\u201d. So we don\u2019t even know their real name, let\u2019s not speak about their ethnic. And also the name \u201cAtilla\u201d a Germanic name. We can\u2019t be sure, but probably, they were Indo-European. These comes from ancient historians: Procopius writes in History of the Wars Book III - The Vandalic War: \"the Massagetae whom they now call Huns\" (XI. 37.), \"there was a certain man among the Massagetae, well gifted with courage and strength of body, the leader of a few men; this man had the privilege handed down from his fathers and ancestors to be the first in all the Hunnic armies to attack the enemy\" (XVIII. 54.). And also: Evagrius Scholasticus writes in Ecclesiastical History. Book 3. Ch. II.: \"and in Thrace, by the inroads of the Huns, formerly known by the name of Massagetae, who crossed the Ister without opposition\" ",

When we look at the DNA results, it's shown clearly.  Xiongnu samples divided into two group as Xiong-Nu and Xiong-Nu_WE. Xiong-Nu results are closer to Mongolics and Xiong-Nu_WE results are closer to Central Asian Turkics (mostly to Uzbeks and Uighurs). And if we look their descendants Tian_Shan_Hun, they\u2019re mostly closer to Turkics than any other nations. Short answer: Yes. They were. At least the elite and ruler ones. Some ignorants will deny this fact but facts are always painful ;) ",

However, the Hunnic horde of the 5th century CE was more of a federation of tribes from various ethno-linguistic backgrounds. They enlisted a plethora of Finno-Ugric, Iranian (Scythians and Sarmatians), Balto-Slavic, East Celtic and East Germanic tribes into their ranks. In fact, the Turkic Huns themselves were most likely just a small minority core of noble warriors with the various foreign tribes acting as vassals. Their closest ally were the Iranian Alans, who actually inherited much of the collapsed empire of the Huns. ",
