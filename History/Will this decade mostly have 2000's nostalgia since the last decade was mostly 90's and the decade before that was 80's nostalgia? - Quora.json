Because of how marketers work it will depend on if they remain in their positions. This is because the demographics of current chiefs of marketing fit the generation who were teens or young adults in the 80\u2019s and they want to appeal to younger Gen X and older Millennials who were young kids in 80\u2019s as well as those of their own age group. But I can see more 90\u2019s nostalgia on the near horizon. Early 2000\u2019s stuff I predict not til after about the mid point of decade where it would run side by side with 90\u2019s nostalgia. ",
