            "answer_text": "First off, if you asked a teenager living in Afghanistan in the early 2000s if America is an empire, you would get a very different answer from most Americans. In order to prove that our hypothetical Afghani teen is correct, I have to go through some history. Most people assume that the Roman Republic ended sometime around 44 BCE with the death of Julius Caesar. Pretty much everyone agrees that the Roman Republic had ended by the end of Augustus\u2019 reign in 14 CE. However, if you were to ask your average roman if Rome was a republic, the answer would be a resounding \u201cyes\u201d. You see, Rome was, technically, a republic. After all, it held yearly elections, and had senate - the only thing was that a) there was a property requirement - basically, if your net worth was below x, you couldn\u2019t run for public office (granted, Augustus paid the dividend so that anyone could run for elected office, but whatever), b) bribery and corruption was rampant and, most importantly c) very few people living in the roman \u201crepublic\u201d actually had the right to vote. Slaves, women, and people under the age of eighteen did not have the right to vote, nor did people who did not live in Italy. Today, the United States governs a lot of areas (namely Puerto Rico, American Samoa, etc.) without giving them the right to vote - Puerto Rico has a governor, but its representative in Congress has no vote, and it has no say in presidential elections. We also have quasi-slave labor in the United States - we call it \u201cprison labor\u201d, but its pretty much indentured servitude, which is a form of slavery. Furthermore, our democracy is even more twisted and contorted than the Romans\u2019 was - we have the electoral college, as opposed to the Romans, who, up until the end of the Republic, had yearly consular elections where pretty much everyone was allowed to vote. The Ancient Romans had strict anti-bribery laws, but these were rarely, if ever, enforced - America, also, has strict anti-bribery laws, but we do have campaign contributions, which are more or less a form of bribery.

            "answer_text": "The status of whether the US is an empire or not is extremely murky. In a strict literal sense the US isn\u2019t an empire because the US isn\u2019t ruled by an emperor. The US was instead a voluntary association of different states that joined together, created a constitution to govern them, and upheld a federal republic style of government that we often refer to as a \u2018democracy.\u2019 However, several groups, especially those who don\u2019t particularly like the USA, oftentimes do refer to the US as an \u2018empire.\u2019 Why? The US has several territoriesThe US annexed large portions of it\u2019s current territory from Native Americans and MexicoThe US has operated for decades of a basis of the Monroe Doctrine, whereby the North American Continent was under the protection of the USA itselfThe US operates today on a basis of global hegemony by operating a series of alliances and intervening in countries affairs.However, I don\u2019t define the US as an empire because the issues aren\u2019t as clear-cut as some others present Every non-state territory is free to leave. An example of this is Puerto Rico, who often has elections on this. They are free to leave if they so desire. Currently they are a semi-independent territory of the US.Most of North America was unoccupied. Although Native Americans were forcibly removed at times, most of them died from disease before the US began expanding. Only a very small percentage of the original population was removed. As for the Mexican territories, Texas willingly joined the US. The other states annexed by the US already had more and more US immigrants populating them than anyone else. They likely would've ended up in US hands one way or another eventually.Superpowers and regional powers always operate on a basis of \u2018hegemony\u2019 by dictating in some form what happens in areas of their interest. The US is so far the only one to govern their hegemony without colonies and force. The US mostly uses a system of economic alliances and military partnerships to maintain it\u2019s status, not military conquest.Hegemony\u2019s aren\u2019t necessarily empires. Superpowers and global powers always exercise power and influence. Simply doing so does not define the US as an empireAlthough arguments are made for the US being an empire, I believe my above points illustrate why this issue is gray and unclear. I personally do not define the US as an empire, and I say that as a neoconservative myself. ",
