            "answer_text": "The 1920's was monumental in changing the role of women...Women were more free during the \"Roaring 20's\". Many women got college education at this time period, unlike before. This cause there to be more job opportunities for women, in different fields. Also women were more free in going out of their house, they could go to mass social events, ex: baseball games, more often. This caused there to be more freedom for women, and they no longer played the role of \" housewife\", or with the children all day long. They could earn money for the family, and marriage was now considered more of a partnership. ",
