            "answer_text": "Yes, abortion laws are definitely more restrictive in France as far as gestation is concerned. Abortion is legal on demand up to 12 weeks. After that, it may be performed for serious fetal anomalies, but usually it's a committee of doctors who examines the situation and makes the decision. It's not unheard of for them to turn down requests for abortions, so it's not *completely* a rubber-stamping process. In the United States, there is no federal gestation limit on abortion. Each state sets its gestational limit. Normally it's around 20-24 weeks. Some states do not have any limits, such as New Mexico. But the contrasts do not end there. In France, there government funds abortions. Also, by law, there has to be one visit dedicated to a counseling session. It's a built-in \"cooling off\" period. Minors need not advise their parents. Also, chemical abortions-- using RU486-- are far more prevalent than in the United States. I believe the majority of first trimester abortions. This makes the delivery of abortion different than in the US. Abortions in private doctors' offices is more common. The United States does not fund abortions, except for a few abortions. The laws on counseling and parental notification vary state by state. Abortions are more common in clinics. Surgical abortions are still predominant, although chemical abortions are becoming more predominant. The last figure I read is that now 25% of US abortions are now chemical. ",
