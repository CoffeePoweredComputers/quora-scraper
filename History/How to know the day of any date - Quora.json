            "answer_text": "However, if you don\u2019t have Excel or a computer or calendar, the following method will also work: This method will look extremely complicated, but near the bottom, I greatly simply everything. Let W = a number from 0 to 6 that will represent what day of the week the given date falls on. (For Gregorian Calendar dates only. Note: Different countries adopted the Gregorian Calendar in different years. So make sure your date is appropriate for its given location.) Use W = (C + Y + L + M + D)/7 , then after the division, let W = the REMAINDER !!! (Note: / means divide by the number after the / mark.) W will be the \u201cremainder\u201d of that division. (a number between 0 and 6 inclusive) C will always = 0 or 1 for Century Years only. (As now explained) C = 0 if the Century Year is a NOT a Leap Year. (A century year which, when divided by 400, has a remainder other than 0) is NOT a Century Leap Year and C = 0. (e.g. Like 1700 >> 1700/400 = 4 & R = 100 or like 2200 >> 2200/400 = 5 R 200) So, these years are NOT Century Leap Years. C = 1 if the Century Year IS a Leap Year. (A century year, which when divided by 400, has no remainder) is a Century Leap Year and C = 1. (e.g. Like 1600 >> 1600/400 = 4 & R = 0 or like 2000 >> 2000/400 = 5 R = 0) So, these years WERE Century Leap Years. Y = (The given year minus its century year) (e.g. Like 1947 where Y = (1947 - 1900) = 47 or like 2000 where Y = (2000 - 2000) = 0). Which is always the last two digits of the given year. (e.g. For 1947 it is Y = 47. But for 2000 it is Y = 00, but we will simply use Y = 0) L = the number of leap years SINCE (but NOT including) the Century Year, UP TO the given date. (If it IS a Century Leap Year, the C number will take care of that situation.) L is always Y/4, \u201cdiscard\u201d any \u201cremainder\u201d). (L will always be a number between 0 and 24, inclusive; 00/4 = 0 and 99/4 = 24 R 3 but we DO NOT USE the remainder, so L = 24 in that case.) (e.g. Like 1947 where L = (1947 - 1900)/4 = 47/4 = 11 (ignore any remainder) or like 2000 where L = (2000 - 2000)/4 = 0/4 = 0 or like L = (1900 - 1900)/4 = 0/4 = 0 Note: For years that ARE a Leap Year, it is NOT a Leap Year for any date BEFORE Mar 1st that year, because it hasn\u2019t LEAPED YET. And for Leap Century Years, DO NOT COUNT it as a Leap Year for dates AFTER Mar 1st that year, because C takes care of THAT situation. M = (the number of days the first of the given month is from the 1st of Jan for the given year)/7 keeping only the remainder. (This will be greatly simplified later) (e.g. Given date is Feb 15, 1947, so the 1st of Feb is 31 days after Jan 1st that year. Jan has 31 days, so Feb 1st is 31 days AFTER Jan 1st. and 31/7 = 4 R 3, thus M = 3 or For Aug 18, 1938. Aug 1st is 212 days AFTER Jan 1st, so M = 212/7 = 30 with R = 2. So M = 2 for that date. ( DO NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS, IT WILL BE SIMPLIFIED IN A MINUTE) Note, DO NOT count Feb \u201c29\u201d when it occurs, because the L takes care of THAT date, if it occurs in the given year. ( Always count Feb as having only 28 days.) NOW, there is an EASIER way to get M, with a little memorization. For dates in the following months, their M will always be: Jan dates, M = 0; Feb dates, M = 3; Mar dates, M = 3; Apr dates, M = 6; May dates, M = 1; Jun dates, M = 4; Jul dates, M = 6; Aug dates, M = 2; Sep date, M = 5; Oct dates, M = 0; Nov dates, M = 3; Dec dates, M = 5 (i.e. so, just memorize: 0,3,3,6,1,4,6,2,5,0,3,5 for your M numbers) D is the given date\u2019s \u201cDay\u201d of the month number. (e.g. given Feb 15, 1947 >> D = 15; or for Aug 18, 1938 >> D = 18) When counting the Day of the month number, DO COUNT Feb 29 as a D = 29. W = the number that will represent the Day of the week, your given date was on. where W = (C + Y + L + M + D)/7 and W = the REMAINDER of that division. ( a number from 0 to 6 only) When W = 1, THAT will ALWAYS be the day of the week, the 1st of January fell on in your dates century year. For dates in the 1500\u2019s, W = 1 for Monday (0=Sun; 1=Mon, 2=Tue, 3=Wed, 4=Thu, 5=Fri, 6=Sat) For dates in the 1600\u2019s, W = 1 for Saturday (0=Fri, 1=Sat, 2=Sun; 3=Mon; 4=Tue, 5=Wed, 6=Thu) For dates in the 1700\u2019s, W = 1 for Friday (0=Thu, 1=Fri, 2=Sat, 3=Sun, 4=Mon, 5=Tue, 6=Wed) For dates in the 1800\u2019s, W = 1 for Wednesday (0=Tue, 1=Wed, 2=Thu, 3=Fri, 4=Sat, 5=Sun, 6=Mon) For dates in the 1900\u2019s, W = 1 for Monday (0=Sun, 1=Mon, 2=Tue, 3=Wed, 4=Thu, 5=Fri, 6=Sat) For dates in the 2000\u2019s, W = 1 for Saturday (0=Fri, 1=Sat, 2=Sun, 3=Mon, 4=Thu, 5=Fri, 6=Sat) For dates in the 2100\u2019s, W = 1 for Friday (0=Thu, 1=Fri, 2=Sat, 3=Sun, 4=Mon, 5=Tue, 6=Wed) Note: The only important dates for most people will be in the 1900\u2019s and the 2000\u2019s. So all you will need to remember is W =1 is a Monday for 1900\u2019s dates and W = 1 is a Saturday for all 2000\u2019s dates. Now to greatly simplify things!!! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \t- - - -All this sounds horrible, but it really IS actually very easy for 1900\u2019s and 2000\u2019s dates. All you need to remember is: For 1900\u2019s dates, C = 0 and 2000\u2019s dates, C = 1 (Note: HOWEVER, C does NOT equal 1 for dates between Jan 1, 2000 and Feb 29, 2000, because the year is not YET a leap year for dates until Mar 1, 2000 or later that year). Y is always the last two digits of the given date\u2019s year. (For 1947, Y = 47). L is always Y/4, Do NOT USE THE REMAINDER. (/) means \u201cdivided by\u201d. (For 1947, L = 47/4 = 11 R3, so L = \u201c11\u201d. NOTE: When you divide by 4 you DON\u2019T USE the remainder, but when you divide by 7 you ONLY USE the remainder. M = (0,3,3,6,1,4,6,2,5,0,3,5) for the months of Jan to Dec. D = the day number of the given month. (Apr 24, 1982) D = 24 Remember: For dates in the 1900\u2019s, when W = 1, the day of the week is MONDAY. For dates in the 2000\u2019s, when W = 1, the day of the week is SATURDAY. Using that info, you can figure out all the other W numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) (e.g. for the 1900\u2019s when W = 0 was a Sunday, W = 1 was Monday, W = 4 was Thursday, and W = 6 was Saturday, etc.) W = (C + Y + L + M + D)/7 KEEP ONLY THE REMAINDER!!! Some examples: (1) Oct 29, 1929 >> W = (0 + 29 + 7 + 0 + 29)/7 = 65/7 = 9 R \u201c2\u201d So, for 1900\u2019s dates a W = 2 is a Tuesday. (2) Aug 2, 1952 >> W = (0 + 52 + 13 + 2 + 2)/7 = 69/7 = 9 R \u201c6\u201d And in the 1900\u2019s W = 6 is a Saturday. (3) Jan 1, 2000 >> W = (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1)/7 = 1/7 = 0 R \u201c1\u201d And in the 2000\u2019s W = 1 is a Saturday. Note: C = 0 because although 2000 is a century leap year, BUT it has NOT leaped YET. and Y = 0 because 00/7 = 0, and L = 0 because L = Y/4 = 0/4 = \u201c0\u201d (ignore the remainder R 0) and M = 0 because Jan is always 0 and D = 1 from the date, Jan \u201c1\u201d, 2000. (4) Apr 15, 2000 >> W = (1 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 15)/7 = 22/7 = 3 R \u201c1\u201d and for the 2000\u2019s W = 1 is a Saturday. Note: C = 1 because 2000 WAS a Century Leap Year. Y = 0 because 00/7 = 0, L = Y/4, and Y was 0, so L = 0 (because you do NOT count Century Years as Leap years, even when they are, because C takes care of that case). M = 6 because that is April\u2019s M number, (see above) and D = 15 from the given date. (5) Dec 25, 2020 >> W = (1 + 20 + 5 + 5 + 25)/7 = 56/7 = 8 R \u201c0\u201d. So, Christmas this year falls on a Friday. Note: C = 1 because 2000 was a Century Leap Year, Y = 20 (last 2 digits of the given date\u2019s year, L = Y/4, discard any remainder), so L = 20/4 = 5 R 0 Keep only the 5. M = 5 because that is the memorized Dec month number above, and D = 25 from the given date. (6) New Year\u2019s Day 2100, (New Year\u2019s Day ALWAYS falls on the same day of the week as the previous Christmas. 12/25/2099 >> W = (1 + 99 + 24 + 5 + 25)/7 = 154/7 = 22 R \t\t\t0, so W = 0 and for the 2000\u2019s 0 = Friday. So, Jan 1, 2100 will also be a Friday. Note: ANYTIME you have a number bigger than 6, you can ALWAYS divide it by 7 and use its \u201cremainder\u201d in place of the bigger number to keep the numbers easier to calculate. (e.g. 12/25/2099 >> W = (1 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 4)/7 = 14/7 = 2 R \u201c0\u201d. Same answer as # 6 above. For that date: C = 1 because the Century Year 2000 was a Century Leap Year Y = 1 because originally Y = 99, but we can divide by 7 and use the remainder. thus Y = 99/7 => 14 R \u201c1\u201d => Y = 1 L = 3 because originally L = 99/4 => 24 R 3 However, remember we ONLY USE the whole number for L, so L = 24, but 24/7 = 3 R 3 and when dividing by 7 we only keep the remainder, thus L = 3 M = 5 because THAT is the memorized number for December dates D = 4 because D originally was 25, but 25/7 = 3 R 4 and we only keep the \u201cremainder\u201d, thus D = 4 So after simplifying the larger numbers we get W = (1 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 4)/7 = 14/7 = 2 R \u201c0\u201d and we keep only the remainder. Since Saturday is the Day for W = 1 in any 2000\u2019s dates, then Friday is the day for W = 0. So 12/25/2099 will fall on a Friday. (And remember whatever day Christmas is, the 1st of the next year will always be the same day, so Jan 1, 2100 will also be a Friday.) ",

The result is the day of the week, 0 = Monday The Julian Day is over 2.45 million so some big numbers. The formula may have obvious multiples of 7 stripped out of it to make the math more manageable. Given a positive year number, month and day in either the Gregorian or Julian calendar, if the month is January or February, treat it as month 13 or 14 of the prior year. Add 12 to the month number and subtract 1 from the year number. Divide the (modified) year into century and two digit year y.
