            "answer_text": "Mary was fanatical but not vindictive. Just as she was inclined to show clemency to Lady Jane Grey, she would not want to have Anne Boleyn executed. However, both political and religious considerations might override this inclination to mercy. Politically, Anne should be fairly safe, since with Henry out of the way, her access to political power or even influence is gone. She is a nobody. However, Anne was a devoted protestant, and while she should be safe as long as she keeps her views to herself, if she starts any kind of pro-protestant agitation or publishes any protestant tract, she may find herself burned at the stake for heresy, as hundreds were during Mary\u2019s reign, and then Philip and Mary\u2019s joint reign.

            "answer_text": "It is questionable whether Mary would have become queen in this circumstance. When her mother\u2019s marriage to Henry was annulled, Mary was declared illegitimate and she was removed from the line of succession. When Elizabeth was born, she became the heir to the throne. Then as part of Anne Boleyn\u2019s downfall, she too was declared illegitimate and was removed from the succession. It was not until many years later, well after Edward\u2019s birth, that Henry restored his daughters to the line of succession. And all this was done with the authority of Parliament (unlike Edward\u2019s attempt to put Lady Jane Grey on the throne). So whether Mary became the successor, or someone else and who that was, would have depended on just when Henry\u2019s death occurred. If Mary had come to the throne while Anne was still alive, she likely would not have shown her any mercy. Mary detested Anne and blamed her for her mother\u2019s misfortunes and death. She would have considered Anne a heretic and probably a witch as well. No, Anne was probably better off being put to death by Henry. At least she got a French swordsman. ",
