            "answer_text": "There are no evil people. There are people who do evil actions. The point of reincarnation is spiritual growth, within a life, and life after life. We are all apprentice Buddhas, apprentice Jesuses. A person who automatically, intuitively reacts with unconditional love to all living beings has qualified and can get off the wheel of life. Note this does not imply acceptance of evil, but rather than judging or punishing, the enlightened person\u2019s automatic reaction is, \u201cHow can I lead this misguided child to growth?\u201d The process of growth needs to start somewhere. The first lesson is empathy. I care for you in your suffering. I rejoice with you when you are happy. Infant souls lack empathy. For them, others are either tools to be used or obstacles to be removed. Evil actions are possible if you lack empathy. In every generation, there are mature souls who are enlightened, or close to it. And you don\u2019t need to live perfect, only die perfect to qualify. And, because of the population explosion of the past few hundred years, there are very many more young souls. They do the wrong things because, as yet, they know no better. ",

            "answer_text": "Do evil people deserve to be reincarnated? During the 1980s I ran in an 11 km fun run called Sutherland to Surf. When I finished I did a U-turn and started running back the other way, so that I could find my son and run in with him. As I made my way back, a spectator who knew me personally, yelled out, \u201cAnd you\u2019ll keep doing it till you get it right!\u201d Personally, I don\u2019t believe in reincarnation, but I know that many people do. So I\u2019m going to look at it from the point of view of that spectator. If somebody stuffs up their life by being evil, wouldn\u2019t it be good if they could keep doing it until they get it right? It certainly seems more humane than condemning them to eternal torment. ",

If there is the slightest justice in the reincarnation system, they will carry the load of their cruelties & crimes on their backs in their next life. Maybe be born crippled, or as sex slaves, or as minorities under Hitler or Stalin, or under similar terrible circumstances. My advice to the evil of this world is to stay away from this planet at all costs - and reincarnate elsewhere! ",

That is how all of us are created equal. ",
