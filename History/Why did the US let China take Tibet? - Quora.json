            "answer_text": "If you are seriously interested in that history, i\u2019ll refer you to a small book: the Snow Lion and the Dragon: China, Tibet and the Dalai Lama, by Dr. Melvyn Goldstein. History lies in lots of details, i\u2019d like to list some here, big or small: Political Tibet was in a de facto independence status from the fall of Qing Dynasty to 1950. Before that, it was somehow a protectorate of Qing empire. So, depending on your perspective, u can either say China annexed Tibet or China recovered its political control over Tibet. 1911 to 1950 happens to be a very dynamic time in international politics. British, who\u2019s a leading role influencing china-Tibet relationship, quit this area totally and handed over the role to a much weaker newly independent India. US just became a new world super power and learned to play a role. India had no willingness and no resource to play against China. The same period was also a fast changing era for China itself. Not surprising, every Chinese governments after 1911 viewed themselves successor of Qing dynasty and considered Tibet is and always is part of China. Even today, Republic of China (in Taiwan)\u2019s official position is no exception. For example, President Chiang Kai-Shek put some efforts (civilian and military) to persuade Tibet government to move away from British influence and re-bond with GMT government. So, as ROC is a major ally of US government after WWII. US had no position to challenge that in 1950. On the other side, US only started to recognize PRC in 1971 by Nixon. You can imagine, before 1971, from this perspective any thing done by Communist China was evil, no difference of taking Peking or Lhasa. US still did bunches of things in Tibet, namely CIA. In 1950, US tried to persuade Dalai Lama not to work with PRC under 17-point agreement, which lasted 9 years. US also worked with Dalai Lama\u2019s brother, Gyalo Dondrup, to train some Tibetans and airdropped them back to Tibetan areas in China. CIA helped to fund a guerrilla in Tibet-Nepal border to attack Chinese assets in Tibet/China. But they were all small scale harassment and never became a large-scale operation or full war against China. Obviously, such war meant a lot investment from US and not much gain for them. After 1971, US dropped all those supports due to normalizing relationship with PRC. From there to today, IMHO, US support to Tibet is mainly for internal politics or leverages in political-economial negotiation with China. So, going back to your original question: Did US let China take Tibet? US recognized Tibet\u2019s part of RoC since the very beginning; US recognized that for PRC in 1971. Did US do something blocking PRC taking Tibet? Yes, but very small. Why? I guess it is just not worth it. People today are still arguing whether US should put any soldier in Iraq or Afghanistan. It is all realpolitik. \u2014 Updated on May 15, 2019 Below is the excerpt from a US government letter to Senator Alexander Wiley dated 11 May 1953: Historically, the United States Government has recognized a continuing claim of the Government of the Republic of China [the GMD on Taiwan] to suzerainty over Tibet and has never maintained direct diplomatic relations with Tibet. The United States Government believes Tibet should not be compelled by duress to accept violation of its autonomy and the Tibetan people should enjoy the rights of self determination commensurate with the autonomy Tibet has maintained for many years. This has consistently been the position of the United States\u2026.The United States Government has never recognized the Chinese Communist regime, neither recognizes nor condones the so called \u201cagreement\u201d of May 1951 under which the Chinese Communists deprived the Tibetan people of the de factor political autonomy which they had long enjoyed.

            "answer_text": "Why do you think China annexed Tibet in 1950? China has been there thousands of years and the country did not expand its territory for hundred of years what you think you know is so funny ahaha. The truth is in 1950 Mao ZeDong with his great revolution wanted to \u2018unify\u2019 everything (cannot thing of another expression) and bring order to the country and when the communist party started to deal things with Tibet their leader at that time , Dalai, tried to rebel. Because Dalai was at the \u2018archbishop\u2019 of the Tibetan people at that time so whatever he says people would listen. In the end of course he has no match against the communist party and Mao Zedong, just like thousands of people who at that time tried to rebel, got themselves killed, Dalai \u2018betrayed\u2019 its people and flee away and the communist party built agreement with the Tibetan leader who is only ranked lower than Dalai in reputation, to avoid a massacre. Why do I say he betrayed his people? Because of the Tibetan tradition by title he would no longer be at the position he would otherwise be when he was in Tibet. If he goes overseas, he has no influence over its people, but he still act like so while the Tibetan selected new leaders so \u2026 China was in a special time with Mao\u2019s revolution and that is all. The Tibetan was just a tiny part of the victims compare to millions of people Mao has killed during that period of time. So when I see questions about Tibetans on Quara I wonder why would anyone get interested in this? ",
