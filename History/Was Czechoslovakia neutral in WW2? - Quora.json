            "answer_text": "In practice, Czechoslovakia was robbed of the German-majority Sudetenland in Fall 1938 and in mid March 1939, it was divided to Czechia and Slovakia. Slovakia became an independent clerofascist ally of Nazi Germany (history\u2019s first independent Slovak state ever) while the-rest-of-Czechia got renamed to Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and it was under full-blown German control, i.e. Nazi occupation. Meanwhile, Czechoslovakia continued to exist \u201con paper\u201d by having a government-in-exile in London that was led by Dr Edvard Bene\u0161, the president of Czechoslovakia before and after the Second World War who obviously had to escape the Nazis. This \u201cCzechoslovakia in exile\u201d was not neutral. Instead, it was a staunch anti-Nazi ally of the U.K. Over 2,000 Czechoslovak pilots were flying in the British RAF (Royal Air Force), for example, along with Polish pilots. This \u201cCzechoslovakia in exile\u201d constantly negotiated with Stalin and Churchill and these negotiations became important around 1942 when Nazi Germany started to lose battles. In 1942, it was determined that Czechoslovakia would be restored in the pre-war borders if Nazi Germany loses, i.e. including the Sudetenland, and the Germans would probably be expelled. The resuscitated Czechoslovakia would also repay all the airplanes and equipment for its soldiers that helped to save the U.K. from Nazism. The U.K. revoked the signature under the Munich Treaty in 1942 \u2013 thus agreeing that Czechoslovakia shouldn\u2019t have lost the Sudetenland in 1938. Only in the final months of the war in 1945, April and May, the Czechoslovak government-in-exile started to behave as a looming master of Czechoslovakia again. Czechoslovakia was on the Nazi side in practice but on the Allies side idealistically. On the other hand, it was surely not neutral. Czechoslovakia has almost never been neutral during any war in the history. We only have this image of an unreadable country at the center, the boundary between the West and East, and stuff like that. But in practice, who controls us is usually very clear, and unlike Switzerland, we\u2019re rarely independent of foreign overlords. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it was an ally, however became occupied by the Germany already prior the start of the war, prequel of the occupation being the Munich Agreement from September 1938 and the work of evil was finalised by full scale occupation in March 1939. The Czechs have been preparing for potential confrontation with Germans for years, especially through building french-style fortifications. Also, the available army equipment and training provided were on the very high level, therefore, it wouldn\u2019t have to be such an easy story for the Germans, if it weren\u2019t for the Munich Agreement, which has effectively ceded most of the forticifactions to the Germans without any fight. After that, the country was effectively defenseless. However, after the occupation, an exile Czechoslovakian government was formed in the UK and after the war broke out, various Czech units have been formed in UK, France as well as USSR. If it weren\u2019t for these fighters, the wartime status of the Czechoslovakia might have been questioned, but it was not and therefore Czechoslovakia has been officially included among the winning nations of the WWII.
