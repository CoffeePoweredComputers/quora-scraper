            "answer_text": "They are all members of the general assembly. The security council is the recognition that these five countries are much more powerful than the others. Without their agreement, it would be very hard to get anything accomplished. Without the security council, votes in the general assembly would determine action. That means that little countries like Laos would have as much say as the US. The little countries would outnumber and could outvote the big countries. These big five countries won\u2019t accept being told what to do by the smaller countries. Without the Security Council, each of the five members would just leave the UN effectively wiping out its authority, funding and reason for existence. ",
