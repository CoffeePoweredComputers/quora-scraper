            "answer_text": "All of humanity was never in the stone age. Only small groups were. The first civilization in history was the Sumerian Empire. They had a writing system, government, laws, metallurgy, medicine and an very advance civilization. Stone age people were groups that left civilized places and became stone age through ignorance. They did not teach their children, the children grew up ignorant, not knowing how to read or write and then went down hill from there. No stone age society has ever advanced. No civilization ever invented a writing system, they already had it in place. No illiterate person ever invented writing. There is a God and He is in control. All knowledge comes from God. When people rebel against God knowledge is withheld. The Glory of God is intelligence. The closer people are to God the more enlightened they become. Each great discovery of mankind was made by the grace of God. Every inventor or discovered of them has acknowledged this. So, in short, if humanity went back to the stone age they would stay there forever and history would never repeat itself because there would never be any great empires or governments that would allow for progress.

            "answer_text": "First, when you say y\u201dback on track\u201d you\u2019re making the assumption that civilization AS WE KNOW IT is the only possible course for humanity to take as it evolves. This is an old concept originating with Hobbes who believed that life without civilization as he knew it would be \u201csolitary, nasty, brutish, and short\u201d and that everyone would be murdering everyone. The truth is that, according to systems theory, civilization as we know it is just one of the many courses humanity could have taken. We know from archeological evidence that \u201cStone Age\u201d humans (as you call them) had not yet invented chronic war, planned resource inequality, social hierarchy, or vengeful big gods. In fact these things didn\u2019t really take on a life of their own until the Bronze age (although the seeds were sowed millennia earlier). I\u2019m not sure that Hobbesian civilization that has brought us these horsemen of the apocalypse is all that desirable. It would be interesting to imagine a civilization that was not based on domination and greed. (Hmm, do I hear you saying, \u201cIt can\u2019t be done\u201d? How do you know? The civilized world has never tried! ",
