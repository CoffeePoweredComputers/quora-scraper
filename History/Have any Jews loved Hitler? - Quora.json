            "answer_text": "When Hitler came to power in 1933, some German intellectuals of Jewish family seem to have felt an enthusiasm similar to that of many other Germans. According to R\u00fcdiger Safranski, born 1945, an award-winning writer on historical and philosophical topics: \"Even among the Jewish population \u2014 despite the boycott of Jewish businesses on April 1 and the dismissal of Jewish public employees after April 7 \u2014 there was a good deal of enthusiastic support for the 'national revolution.' ... Eugen Rosenstock-Huessey, in a lecture in March 1933, declared that the National Socialist revolution was an attempt by the Germans to realize H\u00f6lderlin's dream\". H\u00f6lderlin being a much admired poet and philosopher of the 18th and 19th century. R\u00fcdiger Safranski goes on to quote from a lecture by Felix Jacoby, an academic with an interest in the Roman Empire: \"As a Jew I find myself in a difficult position. But as a historian I have long learned not to view historical events from a private perspective. I have voted for Hitler since 1927... Augustus is the only figure in world history that may be compared to Adolf Hitler.\" (from the book Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil) Although Eugen Rosenstock-Huessey and Felix Jacoby were both of Jewish family, neither were practising Jews.

This comment immediately provoked outrage amongst the public, including one backlash from the New York mayor Michael Bloomberg calling it a \"crazy barking\" and a \"ruthless lash-out that shames us all who sympathize with holocaust\".
