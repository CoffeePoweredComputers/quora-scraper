            "answer_text": "I think the premise of the question can be challenged. Such simplistic date markers in history are both helpful and misleading-helpful in aiding our memories and setting out events in sequence, but often unhelpful in terms of explanatory power owing to the simplicity which is implied. History is rarely a smooth trend curve; rather it is a scatter plot with a general trend. I am not sure it is wrong, but it should be noted that the Ottomans certainly did not lose all its battles after 1683 and it also held most of its territory for at least another century. Study of historical maps shows that the opponents of the Ottoman Empire were NOT simply able to role it up after 1683. Like the Spanish Empire, the Ottoman Empire took longer to fall than most empires take to rise and fall Professor Jeremy Black. The situation can be compared to the 1588 Spanish Armada and the Spanish Empire- the Armada certainly did not mean the Spanish Empire is finished or that the Spanish win no more battles; however the Armada does represent a watershed as an end of Spanish advances.[1] In a sense, of course, a high point is the starting point for decline! An inspection of the many post Armada victories shows that they are often beating off foreign attacks, rather than conquering new territory from rivals, So with Vienna and 1683 with the Ottoman Empire. Immediately after the defeat at Vienna and, allegedly, the invention of the croissant, the Ottomans did indeed suffer a string of defeats at the hands of the Austrians and the Holy League. However, the Ottomans were also fighting on multiple fronts- e.g. against the Russians in the Crimea, where Russian attacks were repelled in 1687 and 1689. Subsequently, the Ottomans did go on to achieve victories: The Ottomans defeated Peter the Great\u2019s Russian army in 1711 at the River Pruth The Ottomans retained Morea, defeating the Venetians in 1715.The Ottomans retook Belgrade in 1739. But it is true that the Ottoman Empire gradually reduces in size. One reason for the Ottoman defeats in the eighteenth century was that it was fighting on several fronts- against Russia and Nadir Shah \u201cThe Napoleon of Persia\u201d and this tended to stretch resources and extend lines of supply.  A general reason for the decline of empires is that the competitors improve. This partially explains the decline of Britain: UK is now much richer than in 1860 but its status as a world power is much reduced owing to its being taken over by industrial competitors from the latter part of the 19th century. The Ottoman\u2019s competitors grew in strength and population during the 18th and 19th centuries so it is uncertain whether the Ottomans were undergoing absolute rather than relative decline. The Ottomans rather stagnated in terms of economy and ideas but this may not have been important had their European neighbours not been advancing rapidly. However, going back to my original point, the Ottomans remained regionally powerful and continued to win battles. By the mid 19th century, the Western powers had an almost invincible technological advantage over other parts of the world, but in the mid 18th century the advantage was less clear and in the mid 17th century only in the areas of artillery, fortification and ships. Although it is true that I don\u2019t think any Asian infantry of the same numbers could have had the effect of the British infantry firepower [2] at the 1759 Battle of Minden [3], there are many components of warfare at which Asian powers such as the Ottomans were arguably superior- such as logistics, where their opponents the Austrians often failed quite badly.

            "answer_text": "Yes we can clearly say that Ottoman Empire lost significant number of military conflicts after the siege of Vienna. But Ottoman war machine was also losing power before the siege. Financial organizations were collapsing. Old trade routes were changing and the discovery of the new world had a destructive effect on the states of the region and Ottomans were one of them. Ottoman Empire financial devices were also out of time and old fashioned. Your military success mostly depends on \u201chow successfully you can run up debts\u201d. European financial instruments were leading the spirit of the time and those countries were arming their forces much more successful than Ottomans. Ottoman Empire was a military organization and the economy was mostly depending on conquests and farming. So these and much more related economical imbalances caused an organizational reaction which resulted crushing defeats. We can also say that Ottomans were paying to buy the best weapons, artillery and ships..etc But that is just like Saudi Arabia now arming their forces with the newest war machines or Egypt buying the modern war instruments but no results on the field. They do/did not have the correct culture and the economical organization which is supported with educated people of the country to create harmony between production of the country and the military. I would like to say that the main reason of those defeats was not just \u201cOttomans could not catch the train\u201d but western countries were advancing too fast. New trade routes, new discoveries, industry revolution\u2026etc Their move was unexpected and hit other countries like Ivan Drago hits Rocky Balboa. Actually we can say that Ottomans were doing fine as a regular Empire and could be able to keep up with the European revolution good or bad but you needed to change your country and society really i mean really fast to catch it which was almost impossible in their situation. Modern Turkey owes this country to the elders who really understand or tried to understand the revolution on the west and push the people to keep up with them. Destruction of Janissaries and founding the modern army, high schools and Military Academies were also as a result of following the world and changing as soon as possible. Ataturk and his generals were already aware of the modern war skills and they were trained according to those principles. Inonu was a great artillery general, Ataturk was a war genious that could read the field by reading the reports and listening to his officers, Fahrettin Altay was a highly skilled field general and a cavalry monster\u2026etc Those generals were trained in western style military discipline and that training was a result of elders who recognized the unpredictable and unstoppable advancing of the europeans which left a country to us that we live in.
