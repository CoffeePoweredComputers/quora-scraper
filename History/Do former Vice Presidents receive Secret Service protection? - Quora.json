It may be extended by the Sect. of the Homeland Security, The protection may also be declined. Here is the actual law on the matter: 18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f3056. Powers, authorities, and duties of United States Secret Service[1] (8) Former Vice Presidents, their spouses, and their children who are under 16 years of age, for a period of not more than six months after the date the former Vice President leaves office. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall have the authority to direct the Secret Service to provide temporary protection for any of these individuals at any time thereafter if the Secretary of Homeland Security or designee determines that information or conditions warrant such protection.

However, most of it expires shortly after they leave office and as such the Vice-President only gets six months of protection after leaving office unless extended. The President is the only former member of the executive branch to receive lifetime secret service protection. ",
