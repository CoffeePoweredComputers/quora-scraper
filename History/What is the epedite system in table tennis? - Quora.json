            "answer_text": "Back in the old hard bat days, two defensive minded players might play endless games of pushing the ball back and forth. In 1936-when games were played to 21 points, the rule was introduced that if the game being played had passed 15 minutes (with the 11 point games it is now 10 minutes and is used if the total points in that game has not reached 18 total points) the Expedite rule would remain for the rest of the match and under the ER, if the receiver made 13 good returns, the receiver would win the point. Under the ER, the players alternate serving. With the advent of the modern sponge game-the heavy looping attack shots, the much heavier spin on serves, etc, you rarely see the ER anymore. Indeed, I have played in dozens of tournaments, and I think I recall only one match where the ER-it was a couple really good defensive players competing under very humid conditions, which made topspinning the ball a bit tougher than usual. So they pushed and pushed and pushed and the ER was imposed. This was about 40 years ago in Dayton, Ohio, IIRC. ",
