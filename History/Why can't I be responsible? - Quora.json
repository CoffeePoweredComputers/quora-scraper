            "answer_text": "We are always a result of the mix of our beliefs and we rank our beliefs in order of the passion/depth of the belief. So they exist in layers inside of us with \u201cI don\u2019t want to die\u201d at or near the top and \u201cI like vanilla\u201d closer to the bottom. So\u2026like in a game of poker, you (maybe unknowingly) shared some of your beliefs with us. Therefore, if you want to be responsible, that would need to rise up higher (more passion/depth) as a belief than it is now. We all have untested head affirmation type \u201cbeliefs\u201d like world peace, end hunger, reverse global warming, \u201cbeing a good person\u201d, etc.. But in general, these are never tested in a high personal stress situation\u2026.like maybe losing your job, losing your friends, losing your home/apartment, losing your car, etc.. Most are \u201cgoing along to get along\u201d type pf cultural affirmations. I suspect your \u201cbeing responsible\u201d might be one of those head affirmations (maybe peer induced). But no matter the reason, you won\u2019t change unless your personal costs/sufferings to remain irresponsible rise up much higher and are higher than the costs/sufferings to change and be responsible. Without that \u201ctest\u201d, it\u2019ll likely remain a head affirmation. I\u2019m 72 and at 18 in college I had a close call with me committing suicide. That \u201crearranged\u201d my priorities. I had been an increasingly skilled thief and liar in high school and this wake up call (test) pushed Virtue way up high on my belief priority list\u2026..to the top, actually. Before that it was a yadda yadda yadda head affirmation only. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay \u2026 for starters, scratch the \u201cWhy.\u201d I suspect your real question is \u201cWhat can I do about my irresponsibility?\u201d You\u2019ve asked the question, which is an excellent start! Know that everyone occasionally shirks responsibility. \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me!\u201d But you do know. It was you. So you start by admitting, at least to yourself, that you were responsible, and that you have to \u201cfix\u201d the problem. You mop up the spilled paint without admitting responsibility. You do everything you can to ease the hurt. You do not walk away from the consequences, whether you admit responsibility, or not. That\u2019s step two. Then, you don\u2019t make that mistake again. You accept the responsibility for making sure the paint is properly stored, or the door is locked or the water\u2019s turned off\u2014whatever it is. Eventually, you\u2019ll probably want to own up to your errors. \u201cConfession\u201d really is \u201cgood for the soul.\u201d And you\u2019ll find that it frequently makes it much easier to fix the problem and learn from it. In summary, then: Know you\u2019re (at least occasionally) irresponsible\u2014CHECK!Do everything you can to fix the problem, even if you don\u2019t admit it was your fault.Figure out what you did (or didn\u2019t do) that caused the problem and don\u2019t make that mistake again.Own up to your mistakes. It will make things easier, in the long run.I hope this helps! ",
