            "answer_text": "I presume you mean exclusively gay. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? The reality, or the term that describes it? Obviously the thing came first. And undoubtedly both societies had people who only had sex with their own gender. In the Legion it was said: Men of no rank cannot marry. Men of low rank may marry. Men of rank must marry. So if you had no rank no one would look at you sideways for not marrying. Though they might wonder at you not visiting any of the women who followed the legions. And in Greece men known to engage in fellatio were not invited to drink from the communal goblet. But they were invited to parties. Alexander the Great was seldom home to be concerned with his wife. And he had temples and entire cities built to honor his lover. At the battle of Troy Achilles\u2019* lover put on Achilles armor and none of the hoplites knew it wasn't Achilles. Proving they were similar in build and age. * Troy was real. It is possible there was a real Achilles, who was later mythologized. Even if totally fictional the story tells us that the usual belief that there needed to be a significant disparity in age between the lovers wasn't necessarily the case. ",

            "answer_text": "From what I know of this, the concept of \u201cgay/straight\u201d didn\u2019t really exist. People had sex with each other, and some of that sex was gay sex, some of it straight. That doesn\u2019t mean that everyone was gay - it just means that it wasn\u2019t thought of as weird or strange to have a sexual companion of your own sex. In Roman times it certainly seems to have been the case that (some) married men still had sex with other men - and it wasn\u2019t seen as particularly terrible. It\u2019s only in the last couple of centuries that we\u2019ve become so terribly prudish and \u201clabell-y\u201d about all this. ",
