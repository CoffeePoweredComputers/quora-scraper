            "answer_text": "Seneca wrote disparagingly of the games.  There's some dispute as to whether his disgust is primarily directed at the cruelty on display or at the tastelessness of the games. Here's the quote (Epistle 7)  I happened to go to one of these shows at the time of the lunch-hour interlude, expecting there to be some light and witty entertainment then, some respite for the purpose of affording people\u2019s eyes a rest from human blood. Far from it. All the earlier contests were charity in comparison. The nonsense is dispensed with now: what we have now is murder pure and simple. The combatants have nothing to protect them; their whole bodies are exposed to the blows; every thrust they launch gets home. A great many spectators prefer this to the ordinary matches and even to the special, popular demandones. And quite naturally. There are no helmets and no shields repelling the weapons. What is the point of armour? Or of skill? All that sort of thing just makes the death slower in coming. In the morning men are thrown to the lions and the bears: but it is the spectators they are thrown to in the lunch hour. The spectators insist that each on killing his man shall be thrown against another to be killed in his turn; and the eventual victor is reserved by them for sonic other form of butchery; the only exit for the contestants is death. Fire and steel keep the slaughter going. And all this happens while the arena is virtually empty.\u2018But he was a highway robber, he killed a man.\u2019 And what of it? Granted that as a murderer he deserved this punishment, what have you done, you wretched fellow, to deserve to watch it? \u2018Kill him! Flog him! Burn him! Why does he run at the other man\u2019s weapon in such a cowardly way? Why isn\u2019t he less half-hearted about killing? Why isn\u2019t he a bit more enthusiastic about dying? \u2018Whip him forward to get his wounds! Make them each offer the other a bare breast and trade blow for blow on them.\u2019 And when there is an interval in the show: \u2018Let\u2019s have some throats cut in the meantime, so that there\u2019s something happening!\u2019 Come now, I say, surely you people realize \u2014 if you realize nothing else \u2014 that bad examples have a way of recoiling on those who set them? Give thanks to the immortal gods that the men to whom you are giving a lesson in cruelty are not in a position to profit from it.  Some read this with the emphasis on \"It was plain butchery\" meaning \"it was pointless cruelty\", others read it as \"it was insufficiently entertaining\".   The rest of the letter is exhorting the recipient not to be unduly influenced by the opinions and vices of others, so it's not entirely clear if Seneca is trying harder to say \"don't be cruel like the masses\" or just \"don't be vulgar like the masses\".   Personally, though, I think it's not just snobbism :  \u2018But he was a highway robber, he killed a man.\u2019 And what of it? Granted that as a murderer he deserved this punishment, what have you done, you wretched fellow, to deserve to watch it? Seneca was a Stoic, and Stoics tended to think that kindness to slaves and the less fortunate was a duty (they were not abolitionists, however).  He later wrote  Kindly remember that he whom you call your slave sprang from the same stock, is smiled upon by the same skies, and on equal terms with yourself breathes, lives, and dies. (Epistle 47) And the next influential Stoic, Epictetus, was himself born a slave before he became a philosopher.  The biggest critics of the games were Christians.  For example Tertullian in De Spectaculis 19   If we can maintain that it is right to indulge in the cruel, and the impious, and the fierce, let us go there. If we are what we are said to be, let us regale ourselves there with human blood. It is good, no doubt, to have the guilty punished. Who but the criminal himself will deny that? And yet the innocent can find no pleasure in another's sufferings: he rather mourns that a brother has sinned so heinously as to need a punishment so dreadful. But who is my guarantee that it is always the guilty who are adjudged to the wild beasts, or to some other doom, and that the guiltless never suffer from the revenge of the judge, or the weakness of the defence, or the pressure of the rack? How much better, then, is it for me to remain ignorant of the punishment inflicted on the wicked, lest I am obliged to know also of the good coming to untimely ends\u2014 if I may speak of goodness in the case at all! At any rate, gladiators not chargeable with crime are offered in sale for the games, that they may become the victims of the public pleasure. Even in the case of those who are judicially condemned to the amphitheatre, what a monstrous thing it is, that, in undergoing their punishment, they, from some less serious delinquency, advance to the criminality of manslayers! But I mean these remarks for heathen. As to Christians, I shall not insult them by adding another word as to the aversion with which they should regard this sort of exhibition; though no one is more able than myself to set forth fully the whole subject, unless it be one who is still in the habit of going to the shows. I would rather withal be incomplete than set memory a-working. The first effort to legally ban gladatorial games came after a monk named Telemachus attempted to stop a gladiatorial contest and was murdered by the crowd. Shortly thereafter emperor Honorius ended the games in 404 (although the ban had to be reiterated several more before it was fully effective - ",

            "answer_text": "Spartacus. EDIT: By which I mean to say: there were moral objections from the Gladiators themselves. So much so that they organised an armed slave rebellion against their masters.  Among Roman citizens, there are scant accounts of philosophers and the like who found the games to be too gruesome or unsightly, and there were some who saw the games as merely propaganda for moneyed politicians (which was pretty much true), but little to nothing is documented in the way of an organised anti-gladiatorial movement from citizens. It's important to note that a great deal of the Roman population owned slaved or were the beneficiaries of slave labour. Slaves (who made up the majority of gladiators), were not seen as people whose welfare should be of concern. The fact that the games were used as by populists to sway voters just goes to show that public opinion was broadly pro-games. Such was the political usefulness of games exploited that in the latter days of the empire over 100 days a year in Rome were set aside as games days. Gladiators were largely slaves, and all performers; they were seen as the lowest of the low in social terms. However, successful gladiators could accrue legions of exultant fans and enormous wealth. It was also a way for debt-ridden Romans to make good on their payments and slaves to earn freedom. Moreover relatively few gladiators were actually killed, and serving gladiators were fed extremely well. Most citizens either weren't concerned by the welfare of gladiators, or thought that the benefits more than compensated for the risk of death. ",
