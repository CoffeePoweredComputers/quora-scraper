            "answer_text": "Hi, Tonna: I noted that you are a physician in Ghana. So, I will tell you what I think public health is all about \u2014 from both my overseas perspective and my more frequent work in the US. And, here is a link from a professional organization and non-profit in the US where I have long been a member:Disclaimer: APHA is a non-profit in the United States. I am a member, a financial donor to them, and I also review abstracts for their annual conference (usually held in November; in Atlanta in 2017). While funding for public health is supposed to come from government coffers, increasingly, and particularly in lower and middle income countries, funding comes from multi-lateral aid packages, USAID (US) or DFID (UK), as examples, MSF (or Doctors without Borders)WHO and, of course, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. However, in my travels, I have worked with a number of engineers from both the Rotary Club International and Engineers without Borders. There are countless US based non-profits working in the public health field; so this is just a small list. Link: What is Public Health? Funding of public health by US State Dept USAID in Ghana: Global Health | Ghana | U.S. Agency for International Development I have worked in primary care, and HIV/TV and Hep C delivery for 30 years. In overseas settings, public health can and often does encompass: community - level or population based vaccine programs; maternal child health delivery; improvement or programs to teach infant weaning practices; teaching mothers how to prepare their own oral rehydration foods/products to mitigate diarrheal disease symptoms; implementation and expansion of family planning delivery. It can also encompass water and sanitation \u2014 alongside with engineers (I worked on those programs in Kenya), in prevention of mosquito-borne pathogens, particularly malaria. It can include family planning education, HIV prevention, HIV education on use of anti-retroviral medications in HIV treatment. And, in some settings, Hepatitis B prevention, vaccination, particularly for women of reproductive age, and Hepatitis C education, prevention, and education on Hep C treatments. And, since chronic diseases are now also the leading causes of death in lower income and middle income countries, public health programs may include education on: nicotine/smoking cessation, alcohol risk reduction, drug and alcohol misuse and treatment or prevention education and, increasingly education and nutrition interventions to mitigate onset of diabetes, hypertension and, increasingly, fatty liver disease. Public health in the US can include both research and policy to realize changes in healthcare practices: examples: bond initiatives to garner more tax on cigarettes, with resources (financial) then supporting pediatric asthma initiatives. Soda (as in soda pop) taxes or fees, with tax revenue then used on childhood and adult obesity programs; excise tax on gasoline, then used to work on clean air and pediatric and adult asthma management programs. I worked on one such program in California. It also includes statistical surveillance and reporting \u2014 also done in most countries and often with help from Western donors \u2014 of many communicable diseases and an increasing number of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The latter has been well known to ID specialists, but only recently is this issue being taken up by public health practitioners. I hope you will consider integrating your medical career with additional public health training. ",

            "answer_text": "Public health promotes and protects the health of people and the communities where they live, learn, work and play. While a doctor treats people who are sick but public health experts try to prevent people from getting sick or injured in the first place. From conducting scientific research to educating about health, people in the field of public health work to assure the conditions in which people can be healthy. In the medical field, clinicians treat diseases and injuries one patient at a time. But in public health, we prevent disease and injury. Public health researchers, practitioners and educators work with communities and populations. We identify the causes of disease and disability, and we implement largescale solutions. For example, Instead of treating premature or low birth-weight babies, we investigate the factors at work and we develop programs to keep babies healthy. And instead of prescribing medication for high blood pressure, we examine the links among obesity, diabetes and heart disease\u2014and we use our data to influence policy aimed at reducing all three conditions. Today, public health encompasses areas as wideranging as epigenetics, chronic disease, the science of aging, mental health, disaster response, refugee health, injury prevention and tobacco control. In public health, microbiologists work to find a vaccine for malaria, while behavioral scientists research ways to discourage populations from smoking. Environmental health scientists work to discover which foods prevent cancer, while our health policy analysts evaluate health insurance programs and make recommendations. And epidemiologists identify trends in health and illness, looking for links, causes and interventions in areas such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and infant mortality.
