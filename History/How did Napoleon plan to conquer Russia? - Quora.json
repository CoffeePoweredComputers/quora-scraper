            "answer_text": "In general, when the capital city of a country is captured, that country has lost the war, and agrees to surrender. Napoleon planned to take Moscow, and then make peace with Alexander the 1st, the Tsar. It is important first to return to the causes of the war. Russia stopped following the Berlin Decree of November 1806, which essentially consisted of a large scale trade embargo on Great Britain: this was the Continental Blockade. This upset Napoleon\u2019s plan to ruin his rivals across the channel, so he decided to invade Russia as a punitive measure. The aim was to extend his domination over Europe, which would allow him to then focus on Great Britain, a priority of his. Here is a quick map of (modern) Russia so we better visualize the plan:  So Napoleon amassed his armies, as one does, and gave them the following orders: Etienne MacDonald was to lead 29 000 men to take Riga (capital city of Estonia, left of St Petersburg on the map) and move towards Saint Petersburg. Napoleon, commanding the First, Second, and Third army corps, as well as the Imperial Guard, and the Cavalry Reserves, a grand total of 195 000 men, would engage and destroy the main Russian army, the First army of the west. Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais, the emperor\u2019s adoptive son, would lead the Fourth army corps, the sixth corps of the Austrian army, and the Third corps of cavalry reserves, a total of 75 000 men, to protect the back and the right of Napoleon\u2019s forces, in order to prevent an attack from the Russian Second army of the west. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte, Napoleon\u2019s younger brother, would take command of the Fifth and Eighth army corps, as well as the Fourth cavalry reserves, a total of 58 000 men, to engage the army that Eug\u00e8ne was defending Napoleon\u2019s troops from (Second army of the west). Karl Philipp of Schwarzenberg (Austrian feldmarshall) would protect the south of Poland from a potential attack from Ukraine, by the Third army of the west, for that he was given the command of the 12th Army corps, 33 000 strong. Jean-Louis-\u00c9b\u00e9n\u00e9zer Reynier, a french general, would take care of the territory between Scharwzenberg and J\u00e9r\u00f4me. And finally, Claude-Victor Perrin would stand by to support the Grande Arm\u00e9e of Napoleon, and staff the Prussia and Poland garrisons with 53 000 men. The Grand Arm\u00e9e was then to march on Moscow after the Battle of Moskowa (otherwise known as the Battle of Borodino, named after a nearby village), a peace treaty would be signed, and Napoleon would be at the apex of his power. The french did get Moscow, after one of the bloodiest battles of the napoleonian wars, but things didn\u2019t go quite as planned after that, and the rest is history, out of the scope of this question. Alexander didn\u2019t agree to Napoleon\u2019s proposals for peace, the Grande Arm\u00e9e was forced to retreat and ultimately decimated by the harsh Russian winter, which it had envisioned spending in Moscow.  The battle of Moskowa, by Jean-Louis Lejeune, 1822.  Napoleon enters Moscow, set ablaze by the retreating Russians. ",

            "answer_text": "He was planning your average conquest. Take all the major cities via siege and push the Russians east by destroying their armies. He made the mistake of staying during the winter. Which more or less undid everything he had done in Russia up to that point. Napoleon had the Superior army and training, but his troops did not know of the power of the Russian winter. This mistake destroyed his entire invasion and was the beginning of the end for Napoleon.
