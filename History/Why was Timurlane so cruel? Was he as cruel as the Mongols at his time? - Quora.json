            "answer_text": "He supposed to be more cruel than Mongols at his time. One of my customers in real estate business was a professor specialized in Timurid State. During our private talk, he mentioned many details about Timur. He was sometimes unnecessarily cruel according to him. Cruelty was a method to keep enemy towns to surrender easily. Seeing the fate of others, many people surrendered easily. The resistants have been punished severely. In Timur\u2019s case, I think his cruelty was excessive. I think the reason is more related to keep his own soldiers in line rather than oppressing other people. Once leader is cruel the horde stay in line. It is like Al Capone and his gang. Seeing Al Capone and his violent potential, soldiers keep the inner discipline. Timur did such things even his own regular soldiers were terrified by his actions/orders. Once Timur gives orders to step on babies by horses or build a tower of skulls, not only his own people but his soldiers tremble as well. Soldiers get tested for doing dirty business and applying orders whatever they are. Timur had Turkic and Mongol roots therefore Turkish historians tend to soften his actions. In reality, he was cruel \u2026 I think he was more cruel than the Mongols of his time as well. His army was loyal unless he was brutal enough to scare them off and provide money. Boss and workers knew how to play the game and rules. Ironically, The Timurid state quickly broke into two halves after the death of Timur. The chronic internal fighting of the Timurids attracted the attention of the Uzbek nomadic tribes living to the north of the Aral Sea. In 1501 the Uzbeks began a wholesale invasion of Mawarannahr. \u2018\u2019 Ruthless, cunning, vengeful and cruel, he announced himself the restorer of the Mongol Empire, though his campaigns were more in the nature of large-scale looting expeditions than empire-building. In the 1380s and \u201890s he and his horsemen invaded Russia and Persia, ravaged Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Iraq and Mesopotamia, and smashed the Golden Horde. Pillage and murder, as Marlowe put it, were Timur\u2019s \u2018usual trades\u2019. Everywhere he went, he waded deep in blood and brains, destroying cities and massacring their populations, building triumphal towers of his victims\u2019 severed heads and carrying off survivors as slaves. In 1398 he invaded India, crossing the Indus on a bridge of boats, reducing Delhi to rubble and taking away enormous quantities of the plunder on which his army\u2019s loyalty depended.\u2019\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: The Sack of Damascus  Source of the picture: Here's the 10 Horrifying Of The Tyrant Tamerlane - FillGap News The only group of people seemingly to escape such horrors were the artisans and craftspeople. Timur didn\u2019t spare them out of the kindness of his heart, though. He forcibly deported them to the city of Samarkand so they could get to work building his elaborate vision of an imperial capital. The city was to be the heart of the Islamic world and so Timur filled it with artists, architects and intellectuals from across Asia. Samarkand became a thriving hub of culture in the middle of Central Asia. \u2018\u2019 Timur wasted no time in showing his enemies who was boss in the most brutal way possible. He spent the first ten years of his rule establishing supremacy over his neighbours, demanding they surrender to him. If they refused, he would destroy their cities and enslave or murder everyone inside.\u2019\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: Terrifying Timur | All About History. Turkish historians tend to ignore some of his actions related to Bayezid I. He was a captive of Timur and had been traveled by force all around Anatolia to prove who is the new boss. We do not know how he was treated during his captivity but somehow his son tried to save him from Timur\u2019s hands and Bayezid II was placed in a cell like place (iron cage) afterwards. For ex: Turkish historians claim he was treated in respect and treated as a guest. A guest in cell. On the other hand, majority of Indian historians claim he was excessively cruel. Therefore it better to check all points of views for an analysis of a character. \u2018\u2019As in India, troops were given a quota of heads to collect for the skull pyramids that were to be built. Two heads per soldier was demanded, and to fall short of the quota meant the loss of the soldier\u2019s own head. Timur ordered that every personal dwelling be destroyed and that, \u201cnot one single house was to be left in the city unrazed.\u201d No quarter was given, not even to women, old men, or children. 90,000 human beings\u2014mostly Muslims\u2014were gutted that day. 90,000 skulls were erected into 120 stinking towers throughout the city of Baghdad.\u2019\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: 10 Terrors Of The Tyrant Tamerlane - Listverse \u2018\u2019 The huge number of prisoners under Tamerlane\u2019s mercy presented a potential fifth column if they decided to revolt while he was engaged in the field with the Sultan\u2019s forces. He decided to take no chances. He cold-bloodedly ordered that all 100,000 Hindus were to be put to death preceding the battle for Delhi. The order is detailed to an extent in Timur\u2019s memoirs: I proclaimed throughout the camp that every man who had infidel prisoners should put them to death, and whoever neglected to do so should himself be executed and his property given to the informer. When this order became known to the ghazis of Islam, they drew their swords and put their prisoners to death. One hundred thousand infidels, impious idolaters, were on that day slain. Maulana Nasiruddin Umar, a counselor and man of learning, who, in all his life, had never killed a sparrow, now, in execution of my order, slew with his sword fifteen idolatrous Hindus, who were his captives.\u2019\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: 10 Terrors Of The Tyrant Tamerlane - Listverse  Painting of Timur.

Source of the picture: Tamerlane Wiped Out Perhaps 17 Million People With Just Fire & Swords Therefore from my point of view, he was excessively cruel even enough to scare his own Turco/ Mongol soldiers and keep them in line and loyal.

            "answer_text": "Was Timur as cruel as the Mongols at his time? Hard to say. By the time that Timur rose to power, the Mongols were not really as powerful anymore. The Yuan Dynasty had pretty much been driven out of China. The Ilkhanate had ceased to exist. The Golden Horde was divided. The Chagatai Khanate had been subjugated by Timur.  The world map in the year 1400 AD. Note that the Mongol Khanates are not really in a position of power anymore. The only powerful Mongol leader at the time of Timur was Tokhtamysh of the Golden Horde. So let\u2019s compare Timur and Tokhtamysh to see who was more cruel. Tokhtamysh besieged the city of Moscow in 1382. After his men overcame the defenses and entered the city, around 24,000 people were killed in the massacre. Tokhtamysh also invaded the Caucasus region and sacked Tabriz in 1385\u20131386. This campaigns seem to have been just as ruthless as Timur\u2019s campaigns. He may have taken as many as 200,000 slaves from the Caucasus. The city of Tabriz fared little better. So it doesn\u2019t really seem like Timur was anymore or less cruel than the Mongols of his time. The difference mostly lay in the inability of the Mongols to carry out such conquests anymore. On the other hand, Timur was able to do so. So Timur would overall have more acts of cruelty, as a part of his war tactics, than the Mongols did. Individually these acts seem no more or less cruel than those of the Mongols. The main difference lies in the inability of the Mongols to conquer anymore as Timur did.  Tamerlane It must also be noted that Timur\u2019s army contained a great number of Mongols. The central core of his army was the Chagatai Ulus. So it is safe to assume that the Mongols (Chagatai) took part in the massacres and such ordered by Timur. Was Timur as cruel as the Mongols during their conquests in the 12th century? I would say kind of. The Mongol Empire clearly beats him on the numbers. He doesn\u2019t even have half the casualties that the Mongols did. However, both committed similar acts of cruelty on multiple occasions. The Mongols just did it more often. The acts of cruelty themselves were quite similar.  Hulagu\u2019s Sack of Baghdad  Timur\u2019s Sack of Isfahan. Doesn\u2019t really seem all that different. Why was Timur so cruel? There are probably several reasons that resulted in Timur being able to carry out such cruel actions. Here are some of the major ones: Timur was born in Transoxiana in the 14th century. This was a region that was under the control of the remnants of the Chagatai Khanate, including the Barlas tribe that Timur belonged to. Timur also spent his childhood in this region and grew up here. Unfortunately, very little is known of his childhood. However, it is safe to assume that Timur did not grow up with a sense of morality like ours. He would have grown up with a far different moral compass. A moral compass that was followed by the Turko-Mongols of Central Asia, much of which was set forth by Genghis Khan. So trying to apply our modern compass to someone like Timur or Genghis doesn\u2019t really make any sense. It doesn\u2019t seem as if Genghis Khan believed that he did anything wrong. His moral compass was simply far too different from out own. Another thing to consider is that the nomadic ways of waging war are generally more ruthless and cruel than those of the settled civilizations (for the most past). What may seem to us like a very cruel way of waging war, might have been seen as perfectly normal to the nomads of Central Asia.Let\u2019s not forget that Central Asia still followed the laws and culture set forth by Genghis Khan. The people of the region still followed the ways of Genghis Khan.Tamerlane had a hero that he seemed to have respected quite a bit. He wanted to emulate that man and his accomplishments. This man was Genghis Khan. So it really should not be surprising that a man that considered Genghis as a hero would have no problem carrying out similar acts.Timur was an opportunist. A man willing to take advantage of anything to achieve his goals. Morality never seemed to have been very high on his list.Timur, like Genghis before him, weaponized fear and cruelty. Most acts of cruelty had a reason behind them. They were to serve some purpose. It was not really cruelty for the sake of it. It was usually for the sake of pragmatism. Look at his execution of 50,000\u2013100,000 captives overnight, prior to the war against the Delhi Sultanate. There was actually a reason behind it. During an earlier conflict, the captives had cheered on the forces of the Delhi Sultanate. Timur believed that a battle could not be fought with a hundred thousand captives in the Timurid camp. They were likely to break free and join the Delhi Sultanate forces. So he gave the order to execute them all. The Sack of Isfahan is a similar example. The city had initially surrendered to Timur and then killed his guards (around six thousand) and tax collectors within the city. The city was massacred to serve as a clear example to every other city in the empire.Another purpose of these cruel acts was to make people surrender without a fight. Many cities would surrender to Timur without fighting, so as not to risk his wrath. ",
