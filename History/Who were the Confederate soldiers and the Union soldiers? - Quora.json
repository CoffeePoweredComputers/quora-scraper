            "answer_text": "Who were the Union and Confederate soldiers during the Civil War? They were very much the same in origin. Enlisted ranks were composed of average Americans, who mostly shared common moral values. True, the southern soldiers came primarily from lower socioeconomic levels. They came mostly from the farms, and were often only semiliterate. Most people in the south worked in agriculture (as did most Americans before WWII.). They often came from large extended families with roots extending back to the earliest European settlers. Many of them were woodsmen and possessed skills in stalking and marksmanship. In the north, with its preponderance of heavy industry as well as efficient farms, the soldiers came from the factories, mines and construction trades. Union soldiers were generally better educated and skilled in complex manual trades. They were, as a rule, better fed, armed, uniformed and trained than the confederates. There was a large percentage of emigrants, some newly arrived in the US in the Union army. Whole units were created and manned by Irish, Polish and German soldiers. There were also units comprised of blacks, many of them escaped slaves from the south. As far as leadership, early in the war the southern commanders obtained better results from their troops than did the Union. This changed as the war progressed. Top leadership in both the Union and Confederate military were basically all graduates of West Point and experienced combat leaders who had served in the Mexican-American War (1846\u201348) and Indian campaigns. A fair number had been career officers in various European armies. These are generalizations, of course. But I think we can all grew that soldiers on both sides fought, died and lived in miserable conditions in the \u201c\u201cBrother against brother\u201d conflict. Pray that it will never be repeated!

            "answer_text": "In November 1860, Abraham Lincoln was elected sixteenth president of the United States. He had been nominated by the Republican Party which was a combination of former Whigs, Free Soil, and Abolitionists. As such, Lincoln was committed to not allowing for the expansion of slavery in the new territories of the West, an eventual emancipation of the slaves, completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, and increasing the industrial capabilities of the United States. Due to a fragmentation in the larger Democratic Party between Northern and Southern Democrats, Lincoln carried the largest total of the popular votes, and won a majority of the Electoral College. He was not put on the ballot in the South. Southern state leaders decided that Lincoln's election was a threat to their economic survival as well a threat to their personal property rights that included owning slaves. Initially, seven Southern states passed ordinances of secession and formed a government in Montgomery, Alabama. After Southern military units fired on the US garrison in Fort Sumter, South Carolina, President Lincoln (who had just been inaugurated a month previously) exercised his constitutional powers to call on the military to suppress the rebellion. This angered people in northern tier Southern states like Virginia and Tennessee. They passed ordinances of secession and joined the seven states in the newly formed Confederate States of America. Those states called up their militas to form what became the Confederate Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. The Confederate military uniforms were supposed to be a medium shade of gray; however, the uniform ranged from light gray to almost black to various shades of brown or butternut. Specialized units like Zouaves had brightly colored uniforms with gray as a base color. Many Confederate units still wore light blue US volunteer army trousers. The firearms and equipment was often the same as used in the North. The Confederacy had a constitution similar to the United States, except the president was limited to one six year term, slavery was legally protected, and the power of the states to refuse to abide by national laws they did not agree with was increased. The Confederacy was a confederation of states together; not a Union of states in a Federal Republic like the United States. The Lincoln administration believed the secession of the Confederate States was illegal and an act of Rebellion against legally elected government. The Lincoln administration called the regular military and militia up to reassert national authority in the the rebellious Southern states. The military objective of the remaining twenty-three states in the United States was to restore the Union by using military force to keep the Southern states in the Union. From 1861 to mid 1865, the United States Army was called the Union Army, the US Navy was the Union Navy, and the US Marine Corps was the Union Marine Corps. The Union did have an \u201c Air Force\" with two hot air observation balloons that were used by the United States Army Signal Corps. Union military units had a navy blue jacket of various lengths. Volunteer militia units wore sky or light blue trousers. Zouave units wore brightly colored uniforms with Navy blue as a base color. The United States Sharpshooters wore forest green uniforms and carried the deadly accurate Sharps breach loaded rifles. Over four bloody years Southern State Confederate Armies and Naval forces would enlist or draft a million men to fight the Armed forces of the United States of America, the Union. Between six hundred twenty thousand and seven hundred fifty thousand American military and civilians would die from disease, injuries, or combat in that period between April 11, 1861 and June 30, 1865 (there is some disagreement on when the war actually ended with some Confederate warships continuing to fight into 1866 due to the problems with the radio not being invented yet for ships at sea to receive news. With the dissolution of the Confederate government, the Confederacy ceased to exist; with the surrender of the last Confederate army and last land combat, the Confederate Army ceased to exist.   ",
