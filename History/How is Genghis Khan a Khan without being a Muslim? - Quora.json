The Mongols first used it when it was assigned to Tem\u00fcjin (later Genghis Khan) after he successfully united the Mongolian tribes in 1206 CE. However, the term had been used by many other civilizations before this to denote a \u201cchief\u201d or \u201cruler.\u201d Its origins have nothing to do with Islam - it was used to refer to a chief or emperor by nomadic civilizations long before Muhammad created the religion. It wasn\u2019t even an originally Arabic term. Long after Genghis Khan, however, the term was connected to Islam when it was used by the Muslim rulers of the Russian khanate of the Golden Horde.  Tode Mongke, a Muslim leader of the Golden Horde, leading his troops on horseback Thus, although he was Tengrist, and not Muslim, Genghis Khan, meaning \u201cuniversal ruler,\u201d received the title of Khan because it had little to do with religion: it was simply a title of power and rank. Khan was used to refer to Mongol rulers of varying religion many years after Genghis Khan\u2019s death in 1227 CE.  Genghis Khan ",

Khan and variants on it like khagan originate from Turkic and Mongolian languages spoken on the steppes of Central Asia. They mostly stayed there until the Mongol empire of the 13th century rolled over most of Asia. When the empire broke up a generation later, most regions of the empire retained a Mongol ruling family and at least partly Mongolized ruling class, but some of them moved culturally and religiously closer to the people they ruled. Notably, some (for example, in the Ilkhanate of southwestern Asia) converted to Islam. In this way, the word \u201ckhan\u201d entered Persian, Arabic, and other languages in or adjacent to what had been the Mongol empire. ",
