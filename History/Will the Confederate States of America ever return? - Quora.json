            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say no chance at all. It\u2019s notable that some \u201cliberation\u201d movements and revolts never died, no matter how many times the people were oppressed or smacked down. For example, the Irish kept rebelling against the English for centuries, for example, until they finally got their own country. But the Confederate States of America are different. Why? Because in the course of the conflict, African American slaves were freed. I believe Lincoln saw this clearly, that taking away slaves would also take away the Souths\u2019 motivation to fight. And that\u2019s precisely what happened. Once slavery was dead, the South\u2019s motivation was gone. The Civil War was never really about a high tariff on cotton or anything like that. It was really about how long the South would be able to keep slaves. Once all the slaves were freed, there was no longer much point to the Confederacy. And then, a funny thing happened. Today, the South sees itself as \u201cthe real America.\u201d Now Southern states act as if they\u2019re the REAL \u201capple-pie-and the-flag states\u201d while the Northerners, they say, are too \u201celitist\u201d for the \u201creal America.\u201d (Apparently, the fact so many of the Founders went to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and William & Mary doesn\u2019t mean anything.)

            "answer_text": "Definitely not. Primary reason being that today's Americans are incapable of uniting on one single cause in a group of that magnitude, ie encompassing several states and millions of people. Hell, Americans are too spoiled, independent, and capricious to even coalesce to boycott a business or corporation! If we could do this we could FORCE industries and corporations to lower prices! But no. Too inconvenient for Joe Sixpack and Soccer Mom Melanie. We have no loyalty. Not even to small business. Oh, we say we loathe the big box chain stores, and would much rather patronize small, local businesses, but we never do. Unless the price is lower. Countless studies have been done that confirms this. We opt for Wal-Mart over The Corner Grocery even if the latter's price is only 15\u201320% higher. Thus, how the fuck could you expect us to suffer the privations of secession? LOL. Even for a cause we deem noble? Not. Gonna. Happen. ",
