            "answer_text": "My personal favorite Chinese emperor is Song Renzong, personal name Zhao Zhen, of the Song Dynasty. Now, he may not have made the greatest achievements in Chinese history, and many of us believe that his reign had no significance, but I believe that he is the most respectable monarch in Chinese history. His tolerance of policies, open-mindedness, and self-control over his imperial power differentiates him from other Chinese monarchs. He respected the literati and officialdom and treated them as equals, he saw potential in them and he never really sentenced any to death unlike most of the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties. Because he respected the literati and officialdom, they respected him and never turned against him, and they were willing to serve the country with the best of their ability. During Song Renzong\u2019s reign, many great historical figures rose to fame like, Yan Shu, Sima Guang, Fan Zhongyan, and the infamous Bao Zheng. They were not only great poets, but also great political figures that made great contributions. You see, he had the best \u541b\u81e3 (monarch minister) relations unlike many other Chinese monarchs, especially the aggressive monarchs of the Ming and Qing dynasties, who treated them as mere servants. Song Renzong even had respect for his eunuchs and maidservants. Under Song Renzong, the Song government is generally believed to have come closest to reaching the Confucian ideal of just government. One common thing in Chinese history are literary inquisitions Where many scholars would get persecuted and sentenced to death for their words, mainly because they were considered too \u201csmart\u201d and their intelligence was considered a threat to the emperor\u2019s imperial power. These literary inquisitions are also seen by modern scholars as the root cause of imperial China\u2019s lack of development. However, this wasn\u2019t the case for Song Renzong, again, he saw the literati\u2019s intelligence as a benefit rather than a threat, so therefore many great scholars rose to fame. He treats scholars and intellectuals with a tolerant mentality. Song Renzong was very benevolent. One morning after he woke up, he said to the eunuchs around him: \"Last night at the office, I felt hungry and wanted to eat braised lamb very much.\" The eunuchs around him responded, \"Why don't we arrange for someone to cook it?\" Renzong responded, \u201cEvery time the people hear of any need in the palace, they thought it was a new rule, and they did it one after another. I am afraid that after eating roasted sheep at night, the people will kill the sheep night by night. If this is the case for a long time, there will be endless killing, and as civilized individuals, we must respect the natural world.\" Renzong ordered that officers of government must be very cautious in using the death penalty, and if an officer wrongly sentenced an innocent person to death even once, he would never be promoted. Renzong once said to his ministers : \"I have never used the word 'death' to scold others, how dare I abuse the death penalty?\" He was able to contain himself and allowed people to criticize him. Unlike many other Chinese monarchs in history that would often sentence those that criticize their actions to death, Song Renzong was very tolerant of criticism. Song Renzong never gave into sensual desires and become corrupt. Throughout his life, he loved Concubine Zhang, but his Empress was Empress Cao, he was able to contain himself and just make Concubine Zhang a high-ranking consort. While he loved Concubine Zhang, he never became incompetent with his ruling due to the imperial harem unlike many emperor like Xuanzong of Tang. While Song Renzong respected the literati and officialdom, he also respected the people. During his reign, the civilians of the Song Empire experience happiness and prosperity. In fact, the Song Dynasty was probably the best era for simple civilians in imperial Chinese history. Song Renzong often placed the people first unlike many other Chinese emperors who gave no heed to the people. How respectable was he? Even Emperor Daozong of Liao, a sinicized nomadic state that was one of the Son Empire\u2019s greatest enemies, mourned Song Renzong\u2019s death. Sure, he isn\u2019t like Qin Shihuang who unified China, but unlike the ruthless Qin Shihuang, he was more respectable. I would rather be a civilian or scholar under Song Renzong than under Qin Shihuang. Did Song Renzong support burying live humans like Qin Shihuang? Did Song Renzong ever bet corrupted or become indulged in sensual desires like money or gold? I think that we should judge who is greater by how they ruled, not what did they did. ",

            "answer_text": "I would nominate Emperor Wen of Han (not to be confused with Emperor Wen of Sui) who reigned from 180BC to 157BC. Oftentimes, he\u2019s not included in any list of greatest emperors while his grandson, Emperor Wu, was always included. Emperor Wen ascended to the throne via a coup, but he did not take part in it. He was selected by the coup plotters due to his humble personality. When the Han Dynasty first came to power, Emperor Gaozu officially brought back Confucianism. But the early Han court was certainly not Confucian in action. Emperor Gaozu, the first Han emperor, died from battle wounds after suppressing a revolt by a would-be usurper. The next emperor was dominated by his mother, and died at the age of 22. The next two emperors were puppet child emperors who were murdered during palace intrigues (the latter was killed as part of the coup that brought Emperor Wen to power). In these early days of the Western Han Dynasty, the state was in danger of falling apart just like in the Qin period. Emperor Wen, the fifth Han emperor, finally managed to stabilize the empire. He the first emperor to truly behave like a Confucian (although it is important to note that Emperor Wen was also influenced by his Taoist wife) by providing tax relief to the impoverished and living stipends to the elderly. He also abolished the practice of imprisoning family members of convicted criminals (except in the case of treason). It was Emperor Wen who introduced the practice of imperial examinations (open to all male citizens regardless of class or wealth) for government posts. And all the while, despite his social relief programs, he managed to reduce taxes by eliminating wasteful spending. Five of the seven emperors before Emperor Wen were assassinated, forced to commit suicide, or died from battle wounds. But after Emperor Wen, no emperor would be assassinated again for another 151 years. Emperor Wen\u2019s grandson, Emperor Wu, was a bit of a mixed bag. Unlike his more tolerant grandfather, Emperor Wu zealously promoted Confucianism as the official state philosophy. But at the same time in person, he behaved like a legalist and implemented harsh punishments to those who broke his rules. Emperor Wu doubled the size of the empire via conquest but also raised taxes and created state monopolies to fund his military operations (making Emperor Wu similar to Qin Shi Huangdi despite their nominally opposing ideologies).
