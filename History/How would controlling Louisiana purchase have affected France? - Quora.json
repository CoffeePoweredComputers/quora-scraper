            "answer_text": "Much depends on exactly how France managed to keep the Louisiana Purchase. Was France, as I suggested in my answer to How might France be if they didn't sell the United States the Louisiana territory?, able to establish an enduring peace with the United Kingdom following the 1802 signing of the Treaty of Amiens and to arrange some sort of settlement in Sainte-Domingue that would leave that island able to support a colonial effort in Louisiana? Did France keep Louisiana after the loss of Canada in 1763? Did most, or all, of New France survive the 18th century basically intact? If France was able to control the Louisiana Purchase, I think it entirely possible that it might have been able to settle the territory. A France that was at peace with its European neighbours, with uninterrupted access to the vast territory of Louisiana, might well be able to successfully colonize the territory, beating Americans from the far side. There might have been relatively few emigrants from France in the 19th century, but I wonder if this had as much to do with the lack of any attractive destinations as it did with a propensity of the French to stay at home. France in the early 19th century had the largest population of any European country, after all, while the territory of the Louisiana Purchase was both vast and potentially quite rich. What could keep the French from controlling the territory, to its potential for benefit, but its own reluctance to do so? ",
