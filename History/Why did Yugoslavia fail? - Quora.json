            "answer_text": "Why did Yugoslavia fail? At least, 5 major causes led Yugoslavia to fail twice, in 1941 (WW2 left deep wounds) and then in the 1990s :  Initial cause : The ethnic (and religious) divide and its difficult handling.While Slovenia and Croatia were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and the Macedonia-to-be had progressively freed itself from the Ottoman Empire in the XIXth century, after 4 centuries under its yoke. Germanic differences on one side, Turkish on the other, despite being part of the same \u0160tokavian linguistic group (except for Slovenia and most of Macedonia), the cultural gap was important between these populations. A religious gap was also present, Croats and Slovenes being Catholics, Serbs, Montenegrins and Macedonians being Orthodox, and important Muslim populations being present in Bosnia and in the Albanians populations of the southern marches of Serbia, in and around Kovoso and Metohija, do to the Ottoman Empire forced conversions under their rule.That divide\u2026 already made internal borders a perpetual governance stake\u2026 and dispute between the different constituent ethnicities of Yugoslavia, as well as with the Albanian minority. Those disputes shows in the \u201cfirst Yugoslavia\u201d regular changes of internal structuration, and of course, were deeply related to \u201cNationalism management\u201d1918 : Initial Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes post WW1 : 1920 : Kingdom\u2019s organization once its territory is settled : 1922 : The Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes becomes an unitary State under the Vidovdan Constitution. 33 oblasti are created to draw the different ethnicities into unitarism : 1929 : The kingdom becomes the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Return to bigger entities, the Banovine, geographically named and more respectful of the ethnic lines, except in Croatia, Sava taking upon Serbs territories in Vrbas (Krajina to be) and Danube (eastern Slavonia). On the other hand, the Kosovo territory has been carefully divided in 3\u2026 If we look at the ethnic configuration and let aside the geographical names used to avoid to refer to historical names, we got Slovenia, Croatia, Dalmatia, reduced Serbian Krajina, Bosnia, North-Serbia + Voivodina, \u201cCentral Serbia i Kosovo\u201d, \u201cExtended Macedonia i Kosovo\u201d, and \u201dMontenegro i Herzegovina i Kosovo\u201d. In 1939, to satisfy the growing Croat nationalism, the banovina of Save and littoral merge into a proto-Greater Croatia, extended on neighboring Banovine where some Croat population live : 1939 : An extended Serbian Banovina was proposed to counterbalance the Croatian one\u2026 The ethnic divide of Yugoslavia would have then been underway, allowing a possible secession in 3 viable countries after some negotiations : 1941 : We got that instead, thanks to the British sponsored coup propelled by Tito\u2019s communists and executed by pro Western Serb royalists who didn\u2019t want of Yugoslavia neutrality, and which deposed the Regent Paul. Thanks guys, good work ! : SFR.Yugoslavia : once Tito freed and kept underhand the country he contributed to throw into WW2, the country was divided in 6 SR, which once again let aside the ethnic lines problems : Brotherhood and Unity ! The 1974 constitution takes in account Kosovo situation and favor Albanians, but let aside the other important Serb minorities problems, especially in Croatia and Bosnia, while it also takes away Vojvodina from Serbia. Yugoslavia is alive, its people thriving despite the political repression of the regime\u2026 But the people behind the 1974 constitution, already thinking about \u201can after\u201d, did place the dynamite sticks that will lead Yugoslavia to blow up once they are triggered\u2026 : 1991\u20131995 : The Yugoslav wars as a result\u2026 Miloshevich, Tudjman, and Izetbegovich through Yugoslavia into nationalism and\u2026 ultimately, inter-ethnic wars on secession grounds : The Serbs want to remain Yugoslav and secede\u2026 from the seceding republics. The seceding regimes refuse. The Serbs insist... That gives us that and 120 000 deads.1999 : after years of inter-ethnic violences, from the Albanian mafias coallized into Western sponsored terrorist organization UCK/KLA, and from Milosevic\u2019s Yugoslavia security forces, with numerous civilian victims on both side, the U.S.A trigger a NATO military aggression against Yugoslavia, ravaging the country with deadly Airstrikes. And the Serbs cleanse Kosovo in response, from both UCK and Albanian civilians\u2026 in a deadly manner.The videos shows the controlled zones through the wars, and the NATO bombings on Yugoslavia in 1999, and nothing else. Tudjman, Izetbegovich, Kohl, Schroeder, Blair and Clinton are missing on the thumbnail : Endogenous cause : The titoist \u201cWeak Serbia, Strong Yugoslavia\u201d policy who led several numerous Serbian intellectuals to write the SANU Memorandum in 1985\u201386 to enumerate what was ailing Serbia and stand in favor of a better service of the Serbians interests compared to the situation at the time. It led in turn to a rising Serbian nationalism, and, if that was necessary, to the realization of a \u201cGreat Serbia\u201d prospect.Under Tito, a lot of the Serbian industry were transferred to the other Republics, especially Croatia and Slovenia, ensuring their economical development and re-balancing in their favor the respective weight of each Republic contributions to the Yugoslav federal budget. (point 2 of the Memorandum).In the 1974 \u201cKardelj constitution\u201d, the crippling of Serbia (the main cement of Yugoslavia) by dividing it in 3 (Central Serbia, Voivodina, Kosovo) made Serbia unable to properly control its political path and economy, hence weakened it, and because Serbia was the backbone of Yugoslavia, weakened Yugoslavia proper (point 3 of the Memorandum This divide decided on the Federal level, could be understandable for Kosovo on an ethnic statistic standpoint (populated at the time with 75% Albanians, 20% Serbs, and 5% of ethnic minorities), but was absurd for Voivodina (Voivodina being populated by Serbs amounting 55% of the population of the province). The rising Croatian nationalism was hence seen as an unfairness, especially after WW2 Usta\u0161e crimes (point 5 of the memorandum) and hence as a threat for the Serbs (point 8 of the Memorandum) and this happening in spite of the help provided by Serbia to the other Republics after the war to rebuild themselves and together rebuild said \u201cStrong Yugoslavia\u201d as well.Endogenous causes used by exogenous elements : the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution, adding-up to the crippling of Serbia : crippling Yugoslavia proper (by making Tito irreplaceable), and setting a constitutional powder-keg by allowing the republics to secede with its article 5 (the temptation)\u2026 under an unanimous agreement of the other republics (the lock). Then, Nationalistic thugs. Franjo Tu\u0111man, Alija Izetbegovi\u0107 and Slobodan Milosevi\u0107 played on this constitutional mess-up of 1974 to grow in Power and led all-together the country to its bloody breakup, under the cheers of the Western Powers : Franjo, head of the HDZ, a \u201cmoderate to far\u201d right Croat nationalist party, was a notorious revisionist (he minored Nazis and Ustashe crimes), fueled by greed for money, power, and a opportunist nationalism, and became the proxy of the German interests (recovering independent Slovenia and Croatia as their backyard) and later, of the U.S interests (divide to rule as a general principle, designate an enemy (the Serbs) and wage war against it as a way to keep existing as the major player and keep NATO awake). A Chicago Tribune article of 1992 speaks in its second part a bit about Tu\u0111man and how he provoked the Croat Serbs to war in 1991 : For Croatia, Help And A ChallengeAlija, Islamo-Turkophile Bosnian Muslim (Boshniak) and his pals, who wanted Bosnia to be a Muslim powerhouse (or in his fantasy, had previously expressed the wish that Bosnia became a satellite / part of Turkey), and was used by the U.S in that regard (they encouraged him to remove his signature from the Carrington Cutileiro plan in march 1992 (which divided Bosnia into ethnic cantons), promising him a united Muslim Bosnia, so he\u2019d go for war instead, armed by countries like Iran or Saudi Arabia (who made a race for influence in Bosnia later on building universities, mosques and Islamist cultural centers to promote their interests in the region).The power-hungry Slobodan wanted to keep Yugoslavia alive\u2026 As a greater Serbia if necessary, intellectually influenced by some parts of the SANU Memorandum, triggered in his rise to power by the Kosovo Serbs plea against the Albanians nationalism in 1987, used and fed the Serbian nationalism to build his power, and hence greatly helped Yugoslavia to fall into war by making quite a threatening mess of himself toward the other Yugoslav ethnicities elites (especially Slovenian and Croatians) and ethnicities (the Albanian ethnics in Kosovo), before Tudjman started to do the same in Croatia toward Croatian Serbs. He miscalculated the historical and geopolitical situation Yugoslavia was in, and the Western allies that Tudjman and Izetbegovich would find on their own path while U.S.S.R and then Russia went on the downward path, hence unable to exert any influence to help him.Endogenous cause used by exogenous elements : A bad banking policy with too cheap money (at the end of the 1970s, National interests rates were going from zero to widely negative in Yugoslavia, helping non-profitable businesses to thrive on the back of the National Bank of Yugoslavia). with zero-to-negative interest rates in the 70s and 80s.The needed money for such policy had to come from somewhere, and it was certainly not coming from the real economy of the country or the Yugoslav People and companies deposits (The banks were bleeding money rather than building their funds). So it came from loans on the international financing market.This led to hyperinflation and\u2026 rising national debt interest rates, the outcome of that kamikaze policy led the foreign U.S aid (through IMF and World Bank) to become a possible leverage against Yugoslavia\u2019s economy financing\u2026 And against the country very unity. The U.S used this leverage in the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for 1991 to legitimize the 6 republics at the expense of the Federation : The US Law that Pushed the Break Up of Yugoslavia ; Public Law 101-513 Nov 5 1990. And crooked nationalist elites in Slovenia and Croatia understood very well that going along would lead to an oligarch eldorado when they\u2019d be able to dismantle Yugoslavia and enforce far from Belgrade resistance on their new independent entities the trilogy \u201cstabilization\u2026 liberalization\u2026 privatizations (Miam ! Yummy !)... Exogenous cause : The end of the cold-war, via the crumble of the U.S.S.R, led the U.S to consider that Yugoslavia existence was not useful for them anymore, and on a more general trend, that new common enemies were necessary to keep their country militaro-industrial apparatus afloat, and NATO awake.The U.S foreign policy changed along the 20th century from isolationism to hyperactive anticommunism, and along that giant stakes rose : political, economical, and geostrategical. The fall of the U.S.S.R did put that in question.Politically, a lot of careers in the U.S States Department and the federal agencies were built on the existence of conflicts in general and the Cold-War in particular. The U.S.S.R down, new enemies were necessary to keep the ball rolling and allow these entities to keep justifying their expenditures and political importance.Economically, the stakes were also huge. Not only the military-industrial complex was to be preserved, but also the dislocation of U.S.S.R was a giant opportunity to expend liberalism into eastern Europe, and put hands on colossal resources to inject into the globalized economy that the U.S dominate.Geostrategically, the fall of the U.S.S.R pushed back closer to Russia the marches of Europe, and also brought more attention to the surroundings of the Mediterranean sea. Saddam Hussein was punished in 1990 when he tried to take Kuweit, and then\u2026 A new \u201ctheater\u201d was needed. And that theater was Yugoslavia.Yugoslavia hence became the next annoyance to get rid of through encouraging secessionism in general and war in particular to keep the U.S/NATO ball rolling and expend the Western area of influence in the Balkans, shatter the non-aligned movement, and force-open the new entities to the Washington Consensus.The new preferred situation in Yugoslavia would be a handful of little republic easily manipulable and unable to play a strong diplomatic role, especially by helping the \u201cSouth\u201d countries to mutually defend their interests against the 2 superpower (and so, now, against the sole American hyper-power).So, to favor that, the parties wanting to secede were to be helped and favored (and the Germans already started this), and the party wanting to keep Yugoslavia unified was to be battled against. The Slovenes, Croats, Boshniaks, and later on Kosovo Albanians were designated \u201cgood\u201d and hence winners, and the Serb backbone of Yugoslavia was designated \u201cbad\u201d and hence loser. The U.S propaganda helped the P.R. of the \u201cstunt\u201d by compelling narratives and photo-ops. Ultimately, Germany, the U.S, Tudjman, and Izetbegovich won in their dark purposes. Milosevic lost in his dark ways. It is to know that if the Yugoslav people and especially their crappy rulers (especially Croatian dirty rulers & war-profiteers to be, and the Slovenians \u201cpolitics businessmen\u201d) were the main involved into the demise of Yugoslavia, all of this probably wouldn\u2019t have happen without Germany fueling, financing, and arming Croatian Nationalism, nor would have it been as bloody without the interference of the United States of America, not enforcing the U.N embargo on arms and at the same time fueling the Bosnian Muslims greed for hegemony in Bosnia, or later on, the UCK terrorist organization in Kosovo. Let\u2019s go on the Chronology now : In 1990, the Germans were heavily financing Slovene and Croat separatists in 1990 (hundred of millions Deutschmarks) to recover their former peripheries than they had in the German Empire / Austria-Hungary Empire times, and promising the elites of these 2 Yugoslav republics a quick recognition of their independence once they\u2019ll earn it on the political ground in Yugoslavia. The Americans, on their side, back the explosion by granting more importance to the 6 Republics than to the Federation in their conditions to grant Yugoslavia foreign aid. In 1991, the Germans started to arm the Slovenes and the Croats.A short 10 days party in Slovenia, the JNA loses and backs off, that didn\u2019t really matter anyway. In Croatia, Franjo Tudjman and his HDZ buddies felt their wings spread, knowing that they\u2019d get the full West support in their independence process. And meanwhile, the real party started in Croatia, for it matters, really, and the U.N Embargo against weapons delivery was not really enforced, for the secessionists were the chosen winners anyway. In 1992, the U.S entered the scene more actively, and sabotaged the Carrigton-Cutileiro peace plan accepted by both the Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Croats, and Bosnian Muslims, by convincing the Bosnian Muslim leader, Alija Izetbegovich, to retract so the U.S would then support his claim of a unified Bosnia\u2026 under Muslim rule. In 1994, the U.S of NATO started to bomb the Bosnian Serbs (who were as dirty as the 2 others parties, but unlike the 2 others, who wanted to remain into Yugoslavia, the country they were being abducted from). The whole west is invited, the party becomes a festival : In 1995, the Dayton agreements settled all this, separating de jure Bosnia from Yugoslavia and acknowledging once and for all the Croatian independence as well as the cleansing which had happen (Serbs cleansed from Croatia, multilateral cleansing in Bosnia, division of Bosnia between FBiH and Republika Srpska, this last one not being allowed to rally Serbia through Yugoslavia). 1996\u20131998 : The Germans and U.K sponsored UCK (a mafia-based Albanian terrorist insurrection considered by the U.S and France as a terrorist group) with training and weaponry. Milosevic handled poorly the crisis in Kosovo by not negotiating along the whole 90s, and exercising a strong repression on the UCK, killing approx. a thousand of Albanians ethnics in the process (a mix of UCK terrorists, and the civilians there were shielding themselves with in the Albanians settlements) while the UCK did the same on hundreds of Serbs (starting with cops, then mainly civilians). In 1998, the U.S saw an opportunity to set a \u201csovereign\u201d foot in the region and bring the too independent Serbia to heed the Western predominance, and suddenly supported the UCK as well, pushing other Western countries to declassify it as a terrorist organization to support it as a liberation guerilla of \u201cFreedom fighters instead\u201d, and pushing the whole of NATO to prepare their \u201cMerciful Angels\u201d for another military circus, the Western world being ready to accept that due to almost 10 years of WesternSerbophobic propaganda. Also, Joe Biden and\u2026 Madeleine All-bright, U.S State Secretary back in the days very active to wage war on Serbs and break Serbia / Yugoslavia were powerful Serbophobics in America). Listen to Madeleine speaking to Serbs protestors after the war\u2026 \u201cGet out, disgusting Serbs !\u201d \u2026 I\u2019m angry when I see this, Madeleine Albright\u2019s race to war in 1998\u20131999 feels retroactively like sending a resurrected Adolph Hitler to go make some armed peace-keeping in Israel) : In February-march 1999, following the escalation of violence in Kosovo between the Serbian Government and the Western supported UCK guerilla, the U.S diplomacy, led by Madeleine Albright, sabotaged underhand the Rambouillet Negotiations to \u201cjustify\u201d a NATO intervention (which were successful the 23 February 1999, and then\u2026 failed the 18 march 1999 -> a detailed explanation here : Julien Philippe's answer to What is the Rambouillet Agreement? Why didn't Milosevic accept it?). This time, the festivities turn into a prequel of Project X : Then, from March to June 1999, the U.S led a NATO coalition to conduct airstrikes on Serbia (included the great return of the German Luftwaffe to symbolically bomb a people that got rid by themselves of the Nazis in 1945 : If we can\u2019t reasonably call that a IVth Reich (can\u2019t we ?), that\u2019s quite a symbol still), destroying not only military facilities, but also refineries, power-plants, factories, bridges, TV and Radio stations, the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade\u2026 while the UCK was bolstered to wage an all out war against the Serbian army in Kosovo. In response Serbian all-out war against UCK, ethnic cleansing against Albanian populations in Kosovo. A development of the U.S reasons to do so here : Julien Philippe's answer to Why did the US bomb Serbia? 10\u201312 June 1999 : Serbian capitulation, the VJ (FR.Yugoslavia\u2019s Army) retreated from Kosovo, the province political future is handed to an international peacekeeping force, and later on to the UCK terrorists. 5 October 2001 : The Bulldozer Revolution. In Belgrade, Slobodan Milosevic is overthrown by an angry street, both legitimately angry against his total failure and crooked rule, and pushed underneath by the U.S who helped so much this failure\u2026 to rebel in favor of a more malleable leader. Milosevic gone, the western democracy wins. More politic freedom (and also more manipulable politicians for the West), and\u2026 the pillage of the country by the application of the Washington Consensus, a mixture of ultra neo-liberal policies. Meanwhile, 200,000 Serbs have been cleansed from Kosovo under the Pax-Americana, and more than a thousand are dead or missing since the June 1999 \u201cpeace\u201d. 2003 : Yugoslavia became \u201cFederation of Serbia and Montenegro\u201d under occidental pressures, who want the name Yugoslavia to disappear. 2006 : Montenegro, led by the opportunist Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107 (left on the upside photo, a former Milosevic supporter / unionist who became an independence passionaria in the 2000s) and tired of being affected by the wrath of the West against Serbia, leaved the federation after a referendum for independence won with 55.5% of the votes. 2008 : The Kosovo puppet proto-Statelet, led by the still terrorist at heart UCK regime under the occupation force\u2019s umbrella of their American masters, declares unilaterally Kosovo independence in disrespect Serbian constitution and of U.N resolution 1244 that states that Kosovo is a province of Serbia. 2017 : Milonegro joined NATO, the alliance that bombed Serbia 18 years before. Milo\u2019s jacket can be weared both side (It\u2019s even tridimensional, at this level). Party\u2019s over\u2026 in surface. Until the next time ? Come on\u2026 I teased you enough with that : Grand Theft Auto - GTA Balkan JugoBeat  Ooops, not the same\u2026 Nevermind, let\u2019s go back on History here : Interesting documentaries to watch to understand the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the economical reforms, objectives, and perspectives revolving around that Historical event (don\u2019t forget to come back at the beginning of the videos, the links bring you in the middle of them) : Boris Malagurski : The Weight of Chains | Te\u017eina lanaca (2010)  Boris Malagurski : The Weight of Chains 2 | Te\u017eina lanaca 2 (2014)  And our story ends up with a beautiful flag of the too short-lived post-communist Yugoslavia. Rotate it from 90\u00b0\u2026 It reminds me of our French one ! :)  Zbogom, velika Jugoslavijo\u2026  Zbogom, mala Jugoslavijo\u2026  ",

            "answer_text": "Yugoslavia failed simply because it was a too unnatural experimental country constructed from the old Ottoman and Austrian-Hungarian Empires\u2019 territories with a too big mix of different Balkan peoples. And therefore never a sustainable country. Yugoslavia formed part of the 1919 Versailles Treaty new world order solutions resulting from the WWI. Both the old Austrian-Hungarian Empire and the old Ottoman Empire collapsed following WWI and its outcome. The Serbs actually looked at the federation Yugoslavia as the Greater Serbia from day 1. This in contrast to the Croats, Kosovans, Bosnians, Slovenians, Montenegrins, Macedonians who all formed individual pretty big % figures of the Yugoslavian population.Extraordinary Tito was however the Yugoslavian main glue post-WWII till his death in 1980. Tito could even handle Stalin. After the strong Tito passed away Yugoslavia disintegrated during the next two decades. Without Tito this would probably had happen decades earlier simply since the country wasn\u2019t a sustainable construction.  The Yugoslavian pressure boiler exploded in the terrible Balkan wars during the mid 1990s with killings, purges, genocide, atrocities in a scale not seen in Europe since WWII.    All these Yugoslavian minoritets were nevertheless pretty similar capable or non-capable of having their own country in 1919 as the Czechs and Slovaks were. As later history actually also has shown. Yugoslavia was yet another mistake of the 1919 Versailles Treaty resulting from the actual root agenda of breaking up the old Austrian-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires and ultimately break up the Central European Axis powers having become a too big economical competitor to the Western Anglo-French powers supported by the USA. Big money talks. Czechoslovakia was the other pretty similar Versailles Treaty mistake from the same root cause. Czechoslovakia was also a fully constructed country having no historic background. Czechoslovakia consisted similarly as Yugoslavia from several individual pretty big % figures of minorities as Sudetengermans/Austrians, Hungarians, Ukrainians, Rhutenians, Poles and of course Czechs and Slovaks. Both Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia were non-sustainable Versailles Treaty mistakes/experiments as later history has showed. To put the subject in an applicable bigger context :Having said this, the Versailles Treaty also made Austria and especially Hungary too small related their to ethnic populations\u2019 borders leading in summary together with the Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia mistakes shortly later in history to pretty important historical events in the European & world history. If WWI had been ended primo/medio 1917 in a balanced peace as almost for certain had happened between the by then exhausted equal main combatants, if USA had not involved itself and declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary in April and December 1917 respectively, both the very old Austrian-Hungary and Ottoman empires had probably more or less survived and had developed/split-up in natural internal processes during the years to come. The young German Empire had probably also survived and developed peacefully.If such a 1917 peace had happened the consequences of splitting them completely up according the 1919 Versailles Treaty had been avoided, the too biased Versailles Treaty itself had been avoided, WWII had consequently probably also been avoided as well as Hitler/nazi-Germany, the Holocaust and the later Middle East conflicts, the atomic bomb, the Cold War and the Nuclear Arms Race. Even the communist revolution in Russia Oct. 1917 may had been avoided, and as such all related later east-west conflicts.The British ruler drawn new borders and split-up of the old Ottoman Empire territories in the Middle East, on the Arabic peninsula and Irak, pretty much done regardless of ethnic borders, had also been avoided. And as such also what still haunts the world even in our time from these regions. ",
