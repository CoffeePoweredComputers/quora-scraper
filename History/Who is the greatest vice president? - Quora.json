            "answer_text": "I think it's harder to define greatness when it comes to a Vice President of The United States than it would be for a President. A Vice President is only as powerful as much as the President wishes. A VP is a senior advisor, senior ambassador at large, and chairs task forces as assigned by the President. Should the greatness of the Vice President be tied with the greatness of a President? Should the greatness be determined if the Vice President become a future President. Saying all that, I feel the greatest VP in my lifetime is George H. W. Bush. He had a broad portfolio in government before assuming The Vice Presidency. http://U.S. Navy pilot; member of Congress; Ambassador to the UN; National Party Chairman; Envoy to China; Director of the CIA.He provided the perfect balance to the ticket in the Presidential elections of 1980 and 1988. A 69 year old conservative former Governor of California, supported by a 56 year old moderate from Texas with a broad portfolio.He served as an team player in terms of getting the Reagan legislation through Congress.He was a senior advisor and confidant to President Reagan. He chaired several government task forces and as Acting chair of the Cabinet and NSC.He was the first person designated Acting President.He followed the Nixon precedent, by running for President on the platform of continuing the agenda of the incumbent President, who can't run for a third term because of the 22nd amendment. Running as his own man, but providing continuity. He became THE incumbent VP since Martin Van Buren to win the Presidential Election.",

            "answer_text": "Based on accomplishments both in office, before office, and after, would nominate George H.W. Bush; head of the CIA, head of the RNC, ambassador to China, Ambassador to the U.N., U.S> Congressman, and his war record during WWII, including flying a plane with both engines on fire and making it away safely, and staying in place till he could be safely rescued. Not bad for a resume, plus he became President, the first Vice-President to succeed since Harry Truman, and to date the most recent one to do so. ",
