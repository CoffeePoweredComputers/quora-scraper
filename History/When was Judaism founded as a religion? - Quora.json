            "answer_text": "Judaism evolved gradually and in stages, so that it is not possible to identify any one year prior to which it was not yet Judaism and after which it was. The terms Jew and Judaism come from the name of the southern Hebrew kingdom, Judah, but the early people of Judah shared many religious concepts with their northern neighbours in Israel. The Israelite people are now known to have been descendants of some Canaanites who left the region of the coastal cities and settled in the hill country of the Canaanite hinterland. At first, the Hebrew religion was indistinguishable from the Canaanite religion, but at some stage in the Early Bronze Age, the Hebrew kingdoms both adopted a new God, Yahweh, as their chief national God. After the defeat of the northern kingdom in 722 BCE, the religion of Judah began to be monolatrous, although not yet monotheistic. In the seventh-century-BCE, King Josiah required that all worship of Yahweh must take place in the temple in Jerusalem. Also in the reign of King Josiah, the Book of Deuteronomy was \u2018found\u2019 in the temple, and the Deuteronomic History (Joshua, Judges, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings and 2 Kings) was written. It is probably during the reign of Josiah that the religion became distinctively different to the religions of neighbouring peoples and perhaps even identifiably ancestral to modern Judaism. If so, we could nominate this as the period in which Judaism was \u2018founded\u2019. The Babylonian Exile and the Persian Period that followed, resulted in a flowering of Jewish thought and scriptural writing. Judaism was still based on rituals that would otherwise be regarded as pagan, such as animal sacrifices at the temple in Jerusalem. The destruction of the second temple in 70 CE brought the old days to an end. Sacrifices would never again be performed at the temple, and the priesthood disbanded. This gradually ushered in Rabbinic Judaism, the forerunner to modern Judaism. The Talmud, central to modern Judaism, began to be written from the second century onwards. ",

            "answer_text": "Judaism has existed since pre-history, but not always in the same format. Its original form could be described as Monotheistic Shamanism. This form of Judaism is traditionally have been practiced by Adam and last practiced by Baalam. Monotheistic Shamanism is the prophetic method of meditation used to attain prophecy. Abraham developed a method of Monotheistic Shamanism that incorporated acts of kindness, Isaac incorporated self-control into this method, and Jacob integrated moderation into the system. This for of Monotheistic Shamanism is called Patriarchial Judaism. Alongside Patriarchial Judaism there existed the school of Shem and Ever in Yireh-Salem which taught Monotheistic Shamanism to select individuals. This was known as the priesthood of Melchitzedek (who was Shem). Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob all were students of Shem son of Noach according to Jewish tradition as stated in The Midrash. The last person to practice Monotheistic Shamanism was Bilam the Prophet, mentioned alongside Moses. Patriarchial Judaism focused on the development of good character and added an ethical component to Monotheistic Shamanism, but it was not enough. According to Jewish tradition when The Jews left Egypt they needed a set of specifed Divine Laws to guide them beyond belief and morality. More so than before because while theology based Monotheism could work in individuals, and morality based Monotheism in small groups The Children of Israel had become a Nation. Thus The Torah was given via the Prophecy of Moses alongside an Oral explanation. This form of Judaism is known as Masoretic Judaism. It is the form of Judaism practiced today. It oulines what to do in all situations. When there is a Temple, when there is not a Temple. Sacrificial offerings when possible and what to do when sacrificial offerings cannot be brought. (The Prayerbook method). All of Modern Judaism is discussed in the principles of law given to Moses. \u201cBut Rabbi Valadez what about electricity, they did not have that then\u201d. Good question. But they did have the principle of building. Electricity is not actually forbidden. What is forbidden is the completion of a new creation via the \u201clast strike\u201d. This concept applies to creating a circuit or undoing a circuit. This is one of the reasons we do not turn on the lights on Shabbat as Jews. But the principle of timers set before Shabbat allows us to use timers set before Shabbat. This principle is derived from a fire left on a heat source that has enough fuel for 25 hours. As you can see Judaism uses the principles expounded in the core laws found in its Masoretic tradition to determine the permisibility and regulate all aspects of human life. It incorporates Patriarchial tradition to determine what is ethical. Monotheistic Shamanism is its foundation since all theology comes from its prophetic tradition. Judaism as a whole is known by another name. Kabbalah. The name comes from the statement, \u201cMoshe Kabeyl Torah M'Sinai\u201d. Moses received The Torah at Sinai. This receiving was the completion of The Monotheistic Shaministic Tradition that Adam, Abraham, and now Moses had expounded upon. This is why Judaism says all Prophets were Jewish even if not necessarily from The Jewish People. Judaism is Prophetic Shamanism. Being a member of The Jewish People is being part of the covenant which requires a person to follow The Mesorah of Moses. A non-Jew only has to follow the Patriarchial Tradition. This has only seven laws. Later Prophets only expounded upon the morality of the nation and urged repentance, but did not add any new aspects to The Mesorah Judaism as it stands now came to exists about 1300 BCE. Patriarchial Judaism begun about the year 1800 BCE. And Monotheistic Shamanism begun about 3800 BCE. Or according to the Jewish Calendar. 2448, 1948, with Adam at the dawn of Civilization with the discovery of fire. The current year since Adam discovered fire is 5780 according to Jewish tradition. The exist of the garden of Eden is reckoned with the knowledge of fire by man. This is seen as the first gift of Prophetic inspiration granted to human beings to ease our life in the darkness of the physical world. ",

            "answer_text": "There are plenty of non-traditional answers on this Answer-page, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. Here is what our religion itself has to say. Abraham founded Judaism, and Moses later received the Torah from God. Abraham (18th century BCE), tenth-generation descendant of Noah, of Hebrew lineage, was the son of Terah, uncle of Lot, father of Isaac, grandfather of Jacob, and forefather of the Israelites. His story is in Genesis ch.11 (end), through ch.25. Jewish tradition states that he was the first to actively spread belief in One God; and it is in his merit that Jews continue to exist (Genesis 18:19, and ch.17). Abraham came from ancestry that had been aware of God a couple of centuries earlier but had afterwards slipped into idolatry (Joshua 24:2). By the time of Abraham, the area where he lived was full of pagan cults; they were polytheistic, worshiping multiple deities. Link: How polytheism beganAbraham became the first to advance the idea of ethical monotheism: the worship of One God, and the appropriate ethical code of conduct. Nimrod, the idolatrous tyrant, had brought Abraham's father (Terah) from the Semitic ancestral seat near the confluence of the Balikh and the Euphrates, and instated him in a position of power in his army in the royal Babylonian city of Ur, where Abraham was born. Nimrod persecuted any who would question his idolatrous cult. The Kuzari (Rabbi Judah HaLevi, 1075-1141) states that Abraham was gifted with high intelligence; and, as Maimonides (1135-1204) describes, Abraham didn't blindly accept the ubiquitous idolatry. The whole populace had been duped, but the young Abraham contemplated the matter relentlessly, finally arriving at the conclusion that there is One God and that this should be taught to others as well. This is what is meant by his \"calling out in the name of the Lord\" (Genesis ch.12). As a young man, he remonstrated with passersby in public, demonstrating to them the falsehood of their idols; and our tradition tells how he was threatened and endangered by Nimrod. Subsequently, Terah relocated to Harran; and it is here that Abraham began to develop a circle of disciples (Rashi commentary, on Genesis 12:5). Later, God told Abraham in prophecy to move to the Holy Land, which is where he raised his family. He continued his contemplations, eventually arriving at the attitudes and forms of behavior which God later incorporated into the Torah given to Moses. Abraham became the greatest thinker of all time. His originality, perseverance, strength of conviction, and influence, cannot be overestimated. Abraham, with God's help, trounced the supremacy of the evil Nimrod. He received God's promise of inheriting the Holy Land (Genesis ch.13). He strove to raise a family (Genesis ch.15, 17, and 24) which would serve God (Genesis 18:19); and God eventually blessed his efforts, granting him numerous descendants (ibid., ch.16, 21 and 25), in keeping with His promise (Genesis ch.17). Abraham founded the Jewish people and lived to see his work live on in the persons of Isaac and Jacob; and he taught many other disciples as well (Talmud, Yoma 28b). Link: Why did God seemingly ask him to offer Isaac up? He saved the population of the south of Canaan from invading foreign kings (Genesis 14); and he was feared by neighboring kings (ibid., ch.12 and 20). Abraham gave tithes (Genesis ch.14), entered into a covenant with God (Genesis ch.15 and 17), welcomed guests into his home (Genesis ch.18) unlike the inhospitable Sodomites (Genesis ch.19), prayed for people (Genesis ch.18), rebuked others when necessary (Genesis ch.20), eulogized and buried the deceased (Genesis ch.23), and fulfilled God's will unquestioningly (Genesis ch.22). He became renowned as a prince of God (Genesis 23:6). Link: ArchaeologyLink: Early monotheismAll of the above practices of Abraham were based upon the ways of God, which Abraham understood through his contemplations. These, and similar personality traits, were the teachings of Abraham and his descendants (unlike idolatry, which had no moral character; with worship of the gods accompanied by things such as human sacrifice, \"sacred\" prostitution, and animal worship). It is therefore clear why God expresses His love for Abraham (Isaiah 41:8) and calls Himself the God of Abraham (Genesis 26:24), and says that Abraham obeyed Him fully (Genesis 26:5). And this is why Abraham is credited with having begun the religion which became known as Judaism. (However, Abraham and his descendants observed their traditions voluntarily, until the Giving of the Torah to Moses 3325 years ago, when God made it obligatory.) MosesMoses was an Israelite, a great-great grandson of Jacob. He was born 245 years after the death of Abraham. The time when Moses was born was when the Pharaoh had ordered his people to kill all Israelite male infants because he (Pharaoh) was afraid that the Israelites would become too strong for him (Exodus ch.1-2). Moses' mother didn't want him to die. So she made a basket for him and put him in it to float in the Nile reeds. He was found by Pharaoh's daughter, who took pity on him (Exodus ch.2) and raised him as her own son. Moses was forced to flee after killing a cruel Egyptian taskmaster, and went to Midian, where he wedded the daughter of Jethro. He eventually achieved the highest level of prophecy (Deuteronomy ch.34) and was called upon by God (Exodus ch.3). He brought the Israelites out of Egyptian slavery (Exodus ch.12). He received the Torah from God (Exodus 24:12) and later recorded it in writing (Deuteronomy 31:24). He went up on Mount Sinai for 40 days and nights (Deuteronomy ch.9-10) and brought down the Two Stone Tablets with the Ten Commandments (Exodus 31:18). He brought the Israelites into the covenant with God (Exodus ch.19 and ch.24), and he oversaw the building of the Tabernacle (Exodus ch.35-40). He was the humblest of men and the greatest of prophets (Numbers ch.12). (Proper attribution: I originally posted this answer of mine or parts of it, on Answerscom.) Note: Moses was a real person. This Jewish tradition has been handed down for over 3,300 years by the entire Jewish nation, and accepted by Christians and Muslims as well. Moses is mentioned many times in the Torah and Rabbinic literature. He is also mentioned by ancient non-Jewish writers going back over 2,300 years, including Hecataeus, Strabo, Alexander Polyhistor, Manetho, Apion, Chaeremon, Tacitus, and Porphyry. Non-religious ancient Jewish sources mention him too, such as Artapanus, Eupolemus, Josephus and Philo. Abraham too, was a historical person, as recorded in the Book of Genesis (ch.11-25). The gravesite of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their wives (Genesis 49:29-32) is located in Hebron and has been known and attested to for many centuries. He is revered by Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The Jewish people have attested to his existence for 3800 years, and his name is mentioned by several ancient non-Jewish historians as far back as 2,300 years ago. These include Berosus, Alexander Polyhistor, Melo, Eupolemus, Artapanus, Hecateus, and Nicolaus Damascenus. ",

            "answer_text": "This is actually a fairly difficult question to answer, because Judaism as it was practiced in 1000 BCE is different from Judaism practiced in 100 CE. Judaism practiced in 100 CE is different from Judaism practiced in 1000 CE. And all of those are different than it is practiced today. Many of the prayers are the same, but some have changed. Many of the rituals are the same, but some have changed. Many of the customs have changed but some are the same. Some of the key events in history that have formed what modern Judaism is are: The destruction of the first Temple in 586 BCE.The formation of the second Temple in 515 BCE.The first Jewish-Roman war (66 CE) and the destruction of the second Temple.The efforts of Philo of Alexandria to bring philosophical rigor to Jewish theology (1st century CE).The bar Kokhba revolt (132\u2013136 CE).The compilation of the Mishnah (oral tradition) into a written record around 200 CE.The compilation of the Mishnah and Gemara (commentary) into the Jerusalem Talmud (sometime in the 4th century CE probably).The compilation of the Mishnah and Gemara into the Babylonian Talmud (5th century CE).The works of Sa\u2019adia ben Joseph in the 8th Century CE arguing against the role of Aristotelian philosophy in Jewish thought.The works of Isaac ben Solomon Israeli at roughly the same time as ben Joseph who brought neoplatonic thought to Judaism.Kabbalah arose in Europe around the 10th century and became a standard framework for Jewish mysticism.The 11th century CE works of Solomon Ibn Gabirol who\u2019s work was very influential in how Jews came to understand divine will.The 12th century work of Abraham ben David Halevi ibn Daud who re-grounded Judaism in Aristotelian thought and set the ground for the most influential of all medieval Jewish thinkers.Moses Maimonides, the Jewish equivalent of Thomas Aquinas \u2014 his work basically became the bedrock of Jewish theological thinking from the 13th century onward.Benedict de Spinoza, who, while not truly a theological writer, none-the-less came to stand as a balance to Maimonides and highly influenced Jewish thinking.Kabbalah meanwhile was going through a lengthy growth process, and came out significantly changed around this time.Moses Mendelssohn brought the enlightenment to world Jewry.Early Hasidic Judasim started to arise in the 1700sIn the 1800s, Reform Judaism arose.In the late 1800s, Zionism became highly influential.The Shoah changed the way Jews thought of themselves and their relationship to the world in ways we are still working out today.The re-founding of Israel, an the numerous wars and conflicts fought to sustain Israel.Judaism today is not the same as Judaism of the past, because all of the above (and many other) events shaped what Judaism is over the years. In some sense, Judaism is ever new, as it adapts and embraces changes in the world around it. In some sense, Judaism is ancient as the underlying principles, beliefs, and formulations are still there. How \u201cold\u201d it is depends on how you view any and all of the above events\u2019 impacts on the religion. When does a religion become a \u201cnew\u201d thing and when is it merely adapting to historical context? ",

All other semi nomadic Semite tribes known by them, as Arabs, Canaanite for Desert Dwellers accepted the Canaanite version & it was the 1st & only religious version in the Levant! The Canaanite worshipers with Canaanite Clergy of the Judeans in Babylon break away, as late, as 456BC officially anointing & giving one of the 70 Elohim, YHWH, Yahweh the apotheosis, as their only Deity in Monotheism, albeit a Canaanite God! Judaism is founded as a religion being a version of a version. Judaism has no Judaic Deities or Protagonists; all are of the Sumerians, Akkad, Canaanites & Egyptians. The Ten Commandments were part of the 42 Egyptian Commandments written in the Book of the Dead, now able even for mortal, poor Egyptians to enter heaven, if the could answer negatively to all 42 Cs.. Mose receives Ten of them from YHWH on a Mount that doesn\u2019t in the Sinai, at a time in 1250BC when the Phoenicians would 1st create their alphabet of consonants only in 1050BC! - That\u2019s why YHWH is only a Tetragrammaton, because there weren\u2019t any vowel concepts till 800BC, by the Greeks, who began the superfluous consonants in Greek from the Phoenicians as vowels! Jew is an English term from French Giu coined to tax foreigners in the 12th C AD in England.

            "answer_text": "The name of the religion of Judaism, obviously comes from the kingdom of Judah, but it was not a religion at the beginning. The telltale clue is that the elements of the religion of Judaism, are basically the old government functions of national Israel. A priesthood, sacrifices for sin, old Israelite laws, etc. When the kingdom of Judah was conquered by Nebuchadnezzar, and the Judahites were taken captive to Babylon, those who still had faith in the God of Abraham, began to proslytize, and they established the ritual of baptism to signify that one had become committed to the resurrection of covenant Israel. They probably role played the government functions of long fallen Israel, so they would be prepared to establish a working government the moment that Israel is resurrected. They returned to Judea, and when Rome conquered Judea, it recognized that the resurrection goal of the Jews was a threat to the national security of the Roman Empire. Rome tricked the Jews into backsliding, so the continuation of the traditional practice of old Israelite government functions, simply became the religious rituals of the backslidden Jews. Herod rebuilt the temple to solidify the religion. IMO, that is when Judaism changed from being a national resurrection movement, to a religion. ",

The citation of 7th century is probably something like when the 10 Commandments were handed down, but the Bible records lots of Judiastic practice and worship of God before then. In fact, the page itself says: The religion of the Hebrews (c. 1300 BC), especially after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD. It takes a while to build two temples and then destroy them.  Citing that as the beginning of the religion seems rather late.  The history books and news would say you were about 700 years later to the party. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. It is possible that many commenters will disagree with my take, but here is how I see it. One has to take into account that the Jews were a people before they had an official religion. The people, the nation, began with Abraham who was called an \u201cIvri\u201d (Hebrew)- \u201cone who crossed over\u201d, because he crossed over the river into Canaan. The Children of Israel, direct descendants of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and his 12 sons who begat the 12 Tribes, had formed into a nation by the time they descended into Egypt because of the famine. There followed the oppression and slavery at the hands of the Egyptians, and then Moses led the Children of Israel out of Egypt into the wilderness, crossing the Red Sea, and from there to Mt. Sinai where they received the Torah. That was the moment that the Israelites, (nowadays known as the Jews) received their \u201creligion\u201d - Judaism, i.e. following the precepts of the Torah, both written and the Oral Law. Over the centuries of the Diaspora in Exile, without a country or a Temple to worship in, the Jewish nation centered around their Torah rather than their land. In modern times, with the establishment of the State of Israel, the Jews are once again a people, a nationality and a religion. The three aspects are inseparable. ",

But of course reading through the Old Testament, we know they failed miserably at almost every task God gave them to do. And that could simply be because they did not have his Spirit of help like we do in New Testament times.

Hinduism is even older Most scholars believe Hinduism started somewhere between 2300 B.C. and 1500 B.C. in the Indus Valley, near modern-day Pakistan. But many Hindus argue that their faith is timeless and has always existed. Unlike other religions, Hinduism has no one founder but is instead a fusion of various beliefs ",
