            "answer_text": "The Conquistador. Hands down (note: I\u2019m assuming hand to hand, no weapons of any kind). Hand to hand combat is essentially martial arts. Once you remove all weapons and equipment, it comes down to experience in hand to hand and skill/conditioning. A US Marine is used to light fighting with a lot of modern equipment. Their bodies are very fit, but are not usually burdened with armor all day. They are good at hand-to-hand and train on it with \u201cnew\u201d techniques, but more of their training is about navigating terrain, firing their weapons and staying prone to avoid getting shot at. Casualties are rare because they don\u2019t take those risks unless absolutely necessary. It\u2019s better strategy at war, absolutely, but it doesn\u2019t let you practice hand to hand as often.  A Spanish conquistador is used to wearing heavy equipment all day. The equipment is heavy, metal, and constantly under the sun.  The Arquebus he carries takes a while to load; he has to pump gunpowder in there and push it with a stick before he puts his bullet. Odds are he will be facing his enemy, particularly when outnumbered, simply because he can\u2019t fire that often. That\u2019s when the sword he carries comes in. Every Spaniard of the time trained in sword-fighting since little; and without the sword you still have the stance, the footwork, and your extremities. Which is something you train for, of course, because they could knock out your sword. And now you\u2019re hand-to-hand fighting. This will happen a number of times per battle (except for the losing the sword part unless your name is \u201cCapit\u00e1n Dedos de Mantequilla\u201d) - you better train for it and win all of them. In fact, the conquistadors, when arriving to what is now Mexico, ditched their own armor because it was too heavy and useless, and they could fight hand to hand better using the Native cotton armor.  But you know what\u2019s even more curious? On hand to hand combat, they would both be likely beat by the guy on the right.  Of all three, the Aztec warrior on the right on the image above would tend to beat the other two (we know that during the conquest, it was Spanish weapons that won the day - on a close physical combat situation as above, even with weapons, it was the Spanish man that died. Hand to hand would have been little different. There are a lot of accounts of low death counts among the Spanish that are incorrect; the reality is that if you go to primary sources, over 1,800 Spanish were killed during the campaign, which was well over half of the Spanish in the ground; a thousand of them in direct battle such as above after they ran out of weapons and only had their swords to fall back on. If you were a Spanish conqueror, you had a 52%+ chance of not coming back. Primarily a hand to hand fighter, an Aztec warrior was judged on physical prowess and hand to hand and direct weapons combat, and was judged not on kills, but on captures - in fact each rank level on an Aztec army had a minimum of enemies you had to have captured in battle (so your mission is to disable him, keep him alive and bring him back). Way harder. When hunting, natives (the Raramuri, misnamed Tarahumara, still do this to this day) would run behind a deer until the deer tires out. Then they kill it with their spear or even a regular knife.  The image above shows it takes about 7 hours of mostly continuous running, or 35km, to make a deer tired enough to not want to go on for its life. Imagine the physical conditioning this requires. Raramuris today tend to win marathons when they enter them while dressed in regular clothes and sandals they make themselves (they used to do it barefoot but they kept getting disqualified).  This was normal stuff for a hunter, and a bare minimum requirement of conditioning for a warrior. And when not doing war, the soldiers trained fighting and also practiced an insane ball game, that really rewards agility - in this ball game, you had to put a ball into a circle using nothing but your hips (both hands and feet use are illegal). Think about how hard that is.  The result of a focus on capturing rather than killing and rewarding agility was soldiers that were always enormously active, focused tremendously on martial arts and that could outmaneuver larger and slower opponents and, if nothing else, continue tiring them until they just gave up. Like that deer. Like they say in martial arts, \u201cthe bigger they are, the harder they fall\u201d. Accounts of feats of native warriors even made it into the winner\u2019s chroniclers: \u201cI saw one of these defend himself valiantly from two light horses, and another one who managed three and four; and seeing the Spanish that they could not kill him, one of them threw his pike, and the Indian, before it hit him, grabbed it in mid-air, and with it he fought us for over an hour, until the crossbowmen were able to put three arrows in him; he finally fell, not before stabbing one of the crossbowmen to death\u201d. And this guy was probably an outlier, but remove all weapons and equipment and put a random one of each to hand-to-hand fight, and I know where I\u2019ll be putting my money, particularly given the likely odds thanks to the r\u2026, let\u2019s just call it \u201cconventional knowledge\u201d.

            "answer_text": "It would depend on how they were armed. If the Marine is in body armor and armed with his Poodle Shooter, perhaps with fixed bayonet, it\u2019s no contest. If the 5.56 NATO round didn\u2019t punch through the conquistador\u2019s breastplate, the shot into his face would do the job. As the late Jeff Cooper observed, \u201cTwo in the chest and one in the head / Always leaves he subject dead.\u201d The conquistador, especially if he was of noble blood, would be armed with a rapier and a main-gauche and was schooled in their use. The sword would give him the reach, though he would still have to get past the Marine\u2019s body armor, if the conflict went hand to hand. The Marine would have his Ka-Bar and would have to get inside the rapier\u2019s arc \u2014 difficult but not impossible. Once he is inside the arc of the rapier, he still has the main-gauche to contend with \u2014 but he has two hands to the conquistador\u2019s one. Pin the parrying dagger and go to town slashing with the Ka-Bar, and shortly you have a dead conquistador. The Marine probably has a better knowledge of anatomy than the conquistador does, and he has martial arts knowledge the conquistador doesn\u2019t. I feel this would give our Marine the edge, despite the conquistador\u2019s superior training in fine steel. Plus which, some Marines continue studying martial arts. If our Marine is one of these, I think the conquistador would have no chance. Semper fi! ",
