            "answer_text": "In no particular order, some paid and some unpaid. Referrals. Referrals from friends and family are most people's best source of business. These clients already know you, like you, and trust you.Open Houses. People who come through open houses are all either potential buyers or potential sellers. If they found your open house online they're a buyer. If they live in the neighborhood they're a potential seller. These people usually don't convert to a sale for 6\u201318 months though.Relocation leads. If your company or a third party helps you get relocation leads then you're in good shape. The only real downside is that you'll usually pay a pretty steep referral fee upon closing.Squeeze Pages. Set up a property specific squeeze page using something like LeadPages or Unbounce or PerfectStormNow. Get people there by running facebook ads of that house and having the ad send the user to the squeeze page.Lender Referrals. A great source of business but you'll usually have to give the lender at least one referral for each referral they give you.Company Webleads. If you work for a larger company they may let you help with internet leads. The quality of these leads depends on where they squeeze the lead. If it's someone requesting a showing then those will convert to sales pretty often (though usually on a different house). But if the site \u201csqueezes\u201d them by asking them to create an account in order to search listings then those will only convert to sales about 1% of the time.Point of Origination Leads. Its nice to have listings because you'll get inquiry's on your listings. Most brokers honor point of origination, meaning the listing agent gets their leads for free.Zillow, Realtor, Trulia and similar. You'll pay a lot for these leads and you'll need to be at least somewhat established or it won't work anyways. These consumers can see your sales history and reviews, so unless you're already selling a lot of houses this probably won't work.",

            "answer_text": "The best way is to list your home with an agent. Buyers can use agents at no cost and agents will show listed homes because it's already written what their commission. Other sources Trulia, Zillow, Real Estate Homes For Sale By Owner Since 1997 etc are also good sources; but most buyer that go to a FSBO are usually not qualified and are looking for a discount. Hope this helps. ",
