            "answer_text": "For me, it was Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. The sheer amount of time it took to get to San Fierro from Los Santos is enough give anyone an idea but I'll go on. The missions were hard and deliberately trying to mix things up each time. Because of this variation, you'd be learning to successfully execute a stealth mission this one time and then try to navigate a jet fighter in the next. And because there were literally hundreds of missions, your job never got any easier. Also, there were always little addictive side-jobs to do. Trying to get your girlfriend to give you the privilege of keeping your guns after you die can be challenging, also can be driving trains or trucks between cities and counties. You can steal, save lives, catch crooks, score with girls, smuggle stuff in trucks, run an intercounty train line, drive cabs and so on and so on. I remember spending hours trying to find every car required for the garage in San Fierro, trying to do the heist missions and train in order to beat the triathlon. The stuff you can do is endless, and most importantly, they are not boring stuff like \"go find six hundred secret candies\". But if you're into that, good like collecting all shells and horseshoes, taking all photographs and painting all graffitis. Man.... I made myself want to play the game now! ",

On a webpage I can't find anymore, a guy who had been a fan of the game since its inception said that he used something like 10 years to beat it. from http://www.giantitp.com/forums/archive/index.php?t-188108.html : This horrifyingly difficult game has frustrated generations of gamers. I  myself have played this game for years and finally, two years ago I  finally beat the game [...] EDIT: See also Fifteen Really, Really, Really Hard Games - IGN ",
