            "answer_text": "Iranians are similar to Arabs in many aspects, but they have their own identity, which makes them \u201cnon-Arab\u201d. Both are mostly Muslims, both are living in Middle East, and they have interacted with each other for a long time. So, one can find many similarities between them, but Iranians are not Arab just because they have different \u201cidentity\u201d. By the way, I think the differences can be summarized as: Iranians have their own languages. Although Persian is the most important Iranian language, but it is not the only one, there are lots of more Iranian languages, now spoken in different parts of Greater Iran (Iran, Afghanestan, Tajikestan, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and other countries). Iranian culture, traditions and mythologies are different to Arabs. Iranians have Shahnameh, which is the national epic of Iran and is considered the definition of Iranian identity. Iranians have their own festivals and celebrations. Nowruz is the most important Iranian festival. Iranians have their own history. In pre-Islamic era, they have been ruled by Achaemenids, Parthians, Sasanians, Kushanians and others. In Islamic era, beside the two first century, Iranians and Arabs have been ruled by different dynasties. Arabs mostly ruled by Abbasids, Ottomans, Ayyubids, Fatemids, but Iranians have been ruled by Samanids, Saffarids, Buyids, Ghaznavids, Saljuqs, Ilkhanids, Timurids, Savavids, Afshardis and lots of other dynasties. Iranians have their own heritage of arts, different to Arabic arts. Persian music, miniature, carpets, handicrafts, poetry, architecture and others. Iranians practice a different sect of Islam. They are mostly Shia, while Arabs are mostly Sunni Muslims. These two sects of Islam are different, both in foundation and in details, although same God, same book, same prophet, but different practices, slightly different festivals, different mourning ceremonies, different laws and jurisdiction, different holly places, different history and different beliefs, to the extend that Shia and Sunni Muslims view each other as \u201cthe other\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Actually there are many similarities and mostly Syrians and Iraqi people look very similar. Sometimes I would think a Syrian as an Iranian since he looks non Arab , but when I ask him what he is, he replies:Arab. Iran is a nation, not a race. Within Iran there are many races which are: Ahwazi Arabs who were in Iran from the time of the Islamic conquest of Persia and they speak Khuzistani Arabic.Turkmenstani which are from Turkmenistan (note: These people are also found in Syria).Balochi which are a people originally from India , and they look Indian even by culture.Kurdish which are from Kurdistan (Southern Turkey, North east Iraq, Northwest Iran, Northern Syria, small areas in Lebanon,Israel, palestine) and they are a people who speak Kurdish with the language of there country (ex. Iranian Kurdish speak Kurdish and Persian, Iraqi Kurdish speak Kurdish with Iraqi Arabic,etc).Azerbijanis are a people from Azerbijan.Lors .Qashqai.MazandaraniTalyishGilakiPashtunTajikPersian which form the majority of Iran and Afghanistan and speak Farsi.Images of races in Iran: Ahwazi Arab        2. Kurdish Iranian       3. Persians      4 Azerbijani Iranian:   5 Balochi Iranian:   6.Turkmenstani Iranian:  7. Iraqi Turkmenstani:  8. Pashtuns:          9. Tajiks     Most Iranians look related alot to Arabs ,Indians,Turkish,and Europeans. Many Iranians are Aryans and are Caucasian(White). Many Arabs think of Iranians as beautiful blondes while Iranians think of Arabs as Darkies, since Arabs have ancestral blood line to Hajjar(Mother of Arabs married to Prophet Ibraheem the father of Arabs and Jews) and Hajjar was an Egyptian Black Slave who had her first child called Prophet Ismael which was the father of Arabs.
