            "answer_text": "It was being worked on - the B-29 was one of the few aircraft able to carry Tallboy and Grand Slam - but the war was ended by the atomic weapons and Japanese surrender, before the US had their T-10 bombs (copy of Tallboy) ready (remembering that Grand Slam was only used from March 1945, and each one took a month to cool down after its explosive fill was hot-poured). Some were modified into TARZON guided bombs and used in Korea. One issue would have been target location: how would the targeteers get information on the location and layout of the underground facilities to be able to usefully deliver the (extremely expensive, hard-to-produce) bombs?
