            "answer_text": "For a majority of them, no. Some died when the pumice rock created from the Plinian Eruption fell on them during their escape through the streets. Some died when the ash in the air became entrapped in their lungs; first breath the ash is dragged in, second breath the lungs fill with fluid, third breath the heat-ash-fluid mixture formed a concrete like mixture in the lungs and asphyxiation soon followed. Some died when the collective weight of pumice, rock and ash collapsed the roofs of homes where people hid. Some died from inhaling gasses, some drowned trying to swim away, some were cooked in pyroclastic flows. There is no singular way that people died, but each and every death would have been terrifying, painful, and drawn out. Deaths mainly occurred from a few hours in, to 96 hours or so after the initial Plinian eruption. So not instantly, unless you were in the wrong place wrong time. The estimate was 11,000 or so people lived there and 2000 died. So in answer to your question, Tl;dr The people of Pompeii did not all die instantly, there were lots of ways people died over the time of the tragedy and around 9000 people made it out alive. ",

            "answer_text": "According to National Geographic(Did Vesuvius vaporize its victims? Get the facts.) and many other sources, it is actually believed that the people of Pompeii died mostly due to extreme heat flashes from pyroclastic surges of hot fumes, ash, and pumice. There are studies, A hypothesis of sudden body fluid vaporization in the 79 AD victims of Vesuvius (This one by PLOS ONE) that prove many people in Pompeii died from heat flash due to seriously high gas temperatures. One example of how the researchers proved this was by heating samples of dead human and horse bones to temperatures the flows of hot gas from Mt. Vesuvius likely produced. The results showed the patterns in the bones were strikingly similar to that of the Pompeii citizens\u2019 bones. Although it may seem a large amount of citizens died from falling debris, a good majority of the bodies found and uncovered are still intact. And yes, experts do say people died from asphyxiation of the ash and being crushed by flying debris, but if you look up how people died in Pompeii, there will be many reports and new studies on instant heat flashes. Depending on location of the citizens, some skeletons have been found with exploding skulls from extreme temperatures, indicating the heat was so intense it boiled and vaporized the tissues and liquids in the bodies. It wasn\u2019t black and white, though. It was a volcanic eruption, so there were a variety of ways people died, but as I pointed out, sudden heat flashes were probably the dominant way a few thousand people were annihilated. ",

            "answer_text": "The majority of people who died in Pompeii when Vesuvius erupted died of asphyxiation from breathing in the air thick with ash. Many of the bodies excavated show them lying in the streets, etc., where they eventually fell and died if unable to get to the boats in the harbor. Some may have died instantly if they were hit by a \u201cvolcano bomb\u201d (rocks thrown from the volcano) but the majority died from asphyxiation and that is a slower death. ",
