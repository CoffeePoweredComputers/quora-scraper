            "answer_text": "To be clear: spices were most emphatically not used to hide the bad flavor of meat which has gone off. It doesn't actually work (you just can't cover the flavor of rotten meat), and given the immense cost of spices, frequently worth their weight in silver or even gold, they'd be much more expensive than just getting fresh meat, which, if nothing else, could be produced locally. They could be used as a component in preserving foods (many spices have antimicrobial properties), but usually in conjunction with more effective techniques like salting, drying, smoking, and pickling. But they did have a number of other desirable properties which made them absurdly expensive in Medieval Europe. There's culinary use, of course. Spices taste awesome. Who wouldn't want that? They also had medicinal uses. Though their actual value as medicine is not very high, they were thought to have significant value in preventing and treating diseases. For example, diseases were often though to be the result of breathing bad air. Having wonderful spices around to smell was though to counteract that.  And they had religious uses. In Christian societies, spices were used as an incense ingredient, used in all manner of ceremonies. Their aroma was used as a symbol of the air to be found in heaven.  So that's the demand side. On the supply side, they were produced in very limited locations. Nutmeg and the associated spice mace, possibly the most extreme examples, were only produced on a handful of tiny islands in the South Pacific. Others were somewhat more common, but none were particularly easy to get. Moreover, few were produced anywhere close to Europe, and there were often political obstacles along the way. But the relationship is pretty simple: low supply, high demand, lots of trade barriers, therefore astronomical prices.  ",

            "answer_text": "Because spices are magnificent!! Some spices  were once worth their weight in gold, and it's not because they wanted to sprinkle them on their favorite foods. Spices began as anything but culinary, they were used widely as medicines, from eliminating the plague to curing an infection and healing cuts and wounds. Spices also varied in use is different continents and countries. As with their high preservative properties, some spices were used to preserve the dead. Egyptians used spices for embalming. Other countries felt that the extreme flavor, smell, and beneficial properties of the spices would allow them to be closer to their deities, and having the spices around them will give them an opportunity to going to the afterlife. with these two points mentioned, of course spices would be prized possessions, helping people survive and giving people hope for the future. Later on spices were used for preserving foods as dodges weren't available. It allowed humans to work less on hunting and use their time for other things such as explorations. And finally as we all have taste buds, we couldn't resist the flavors they provided us, and spices hit big in the culinary world  ",
