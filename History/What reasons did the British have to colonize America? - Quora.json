            "answer_text": "I\u2019m an amateur in this matter (history in general) but I\u2019ll try. I think the most reason for any attempt on colonization is mainly economical, for America this might be the case: The reports coming from the earlier explorers must have stated that the land is still sparsely inhibited. It means for the europeans the chance to grab more territory, be it for residential or economical reasons.Britain, or more exactly Great Britain is one of the country which adopted non Roman-Catholic religions (church of England, puritanism, etc.). This would mean that there would be religious oppression happening, especially towards the minority, or there would be reasons to leave your home country, since what is being taught in Religion does not fit the lifestyle from the place where you live. And since America was still sparsely populated, these religious groups could actually start from the ground up, building their \u201cutopia\u201d according to their teaching.Pressure from another European nations (especially France and Spain). The news about the discovery of America would also spread to the leader of foreign nations such as France and Spain. This would lead them to do the same thing; to invest in more territory. As a precaution, it would make sense to grab as many land as quickly as possible, to negate your European counterpart from doing it to you. The side effect of this also includes bragging right; since having a colony does not only mean you have access to newly discovered goods (such as fruits from the new world, e.g. sugar cane and tobacco), but having a functioning colony also means that you have the means to protect the colony, from outside dangers like the wildlife or the native people or threat from another country, or inside dangers such as rebellions or plagues.Basically, it\u2019s the basic 3Gs; God, Gold and Glory.

            "answer_text": "There was no explicit state decision; rather, various independent groups had various motives and acted upon them. In the north of N America, the Pilgrim Fathers wanted to separate themselves from the Church of England and worship in their own way. They regarded the Church of England as hopelessly corrupt and beyond redemption. (They were thus \u2018Separatists\u2019 rather than \u2018Puritans\u2019; the latter believed the Church of England was still capable of being purified.) They had already tried separating themselves once before by going to the Netherlands but this was not very successful - they had difficulty getting work because they neither spoke Dutch/Flemish nor did they have the skills to compete in the advanced labour market of the Netherlands, and they found that their children were too liable to turn themselves into little Dutch people - so they tried again by removing themselves to what they regarded as an unpopulated area of the New World. They were successful-enough in this, eventually, to encourage others to follow them. Elsewhere, the motives were more commercial. The Virginia colony was a business venture - the colonists were instructed to find a cash crop that could be returned to England and sold profitably. They found one, in tobacco. (Elsewhere in the New World, sugar from the Caribbean became the most profitable crop of all.) Given the apparent success of the Massachusetts Bay and Virginia colonies, other groups followed them and the colonies spread. It was a number of decades before the English state involved itself in regulating the colonies. So the English/British colonisation of N America happened by accident and without any real plan. ",
