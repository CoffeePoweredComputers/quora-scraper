Also, most people certainly do not know how to prepare it, or appreciate \u201csweating\u201d spices dry or in an oil. Personally, I like the intensity of flavor, in some recipes, while it is greener dried. Still a bit plump. Or, if dried, certainly fresher\u2026and often sweated. Toasted, like Indian masala blends often are. Oh yes\u2026some people have a genetic \u201csoapy\" taste experience to coriander. I think Indians as a group have a very low incidence of this gene expression. Coriander rapidly loses its flavor in extended storage. In an Indian type of spice blend, a masala. Coriander is indispensable! Just like it's parent plant, cilantro\u2026(dried cilantro is the biggest waste of money on the planet!), dried coriander seeds quickly lose that oomph, I like greener coriander seeds for. In other dishes, I like toasting coriander to bring out the nutty, citrusy flavors. That technique of sweating spices is underappreciated by many Americans, and most American cooks. Toasting spices or sweating spices? \u201cI've never heard of it\u201d\u2026 Let me tell you, that is one \u201csecret\u201d I employ for making chili. This technique really opens up, and unlocks such character in a dish. Indian. Mexican, and Spanish fare all taste better with fresher coriander seeds imho. Unfamiliarity\u2026freshness. I have probably 20 cilantro plants gone to seed\u2026 ty for reminding me. To replant\u2026perhaps, use a few, it's Indian Curry time. BTw, your question was almost like divine guidance\u2026i was wondering what to make for dinner tomorrow. Dried, Toasted, Ground versus whole. Larger seeded varities versus the smaller seeded varieties, most people are not aware of all coriander's nuances, and uses. ",

            "answer_text": "You are mistaken. Coriander and it\u2019s leaves, called Cilantro, are a very popular spice in cooking in Latin American, Middle Eastern, and Asian cooking. The seeds are earthy, tart and, spicy with a complex taste, while I find the leaves very peppery with a hint of citrus. Coriander is in the parsley family and is native to Southern Europe, North Africa, and Southwest Asia. Coriander is treasured in Indian, Middle Eastern, Egyptian, Mexican, Thai, Levantine, Armenian, Chinese, Vietnamese, and other Latin American and Asian countries. Coriander is also used in pickling spices. It has gained popularity in American cuisine as well.  ",
