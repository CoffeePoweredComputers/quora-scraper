            "answer_text": "I googled your question and got this photo:  General Kurt Waeger grants the honors of war to the french troops after the siege of Lille, where 40 000 men with 50 tanks delayed by 4 days 7 German divisions (about 120,000 men) with 800 tanks which were attempting to destroy the Allies at Dunkirk. June 1, 1940 I had never before heard of this event. I know that Goring claimed that the Luftwaffe alone could stop an evacuation. I also know that the German Air Force bombed the hell out of those beaches and attacked any ship involved in the evacuation. But this one photo proves that these French troops had indeed put up a fight worthy of being honored, even by their enemies and maybe also the fact that not every German was a pig, not even during WWII.
