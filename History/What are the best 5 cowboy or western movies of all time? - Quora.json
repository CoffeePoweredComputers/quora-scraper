            "answer_text": " 5. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) - A rarity in that it is the third film in a trilogy, and the best. It follows A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. All three films are extremely low budget spaghetti westerns that find their strengths in those constraints. The film has one of the most recognizable music scores in film, by Ennio Moricone. Three criminals, played by Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach, set out, during the Civil War, to find a cache of gold, hidden in a cemetery. Clint Eastwood's success in television had prevented his success in movies. This trilogy of films changed that.  4. Red River (1948) - Another Hawks/Wayne collaboration. In the Dark Knight, there's a line that goes: \"You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\" Red River is an examination of that process. It is also a look at one of the legendary cattle drives from Texas to Kansas. Wayne plays Thomas Dunson, depicted over a 14 year period, as we watch him go from a young, ambitious white hat starting his ranch to a jaded, tired black hat cattle baron. It's also a story of the decline of the father and ascendancy of the son, with a young Montgomery Clift as Dunson's adopted son, Matt.  3. Stagecoach (1939) - This is the film that made John Wayne a star. He had had one chance at the A-list in a movie that failed and had spent a decade doing B-movies. But in John Ford's Stagecoach, he showed he had the stuff to be a star. Stagecoach is the archetype of the movie in which a group of very dissimilar people must come together to survive a great challenge. Wayne plays \"The Ringo Kid\" a fugitive intent on avenging the murder of his father and brother. Also on the stagecoach are a gunslinging gambler (played with mustache-twirling glee by John Carradine), a corrupt banker, a prostitute, an alcoholic doctor, a pregnant woman, a meek salesman, and a marshal. Their journey takes them through hazardous Apache territory which provides a stunning action scene as the stagecoach is chased across the desert by a swarm of Apache warriors. The stunt work is impressive, including a stunt in which a character is dragged under a team of horses and down the length of the stagecoach. It is this stunt to which the famed scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark pays homage.  2. Unforgiven (1992) - Unforgiven is Clint Eastwood's elegy to the western and his bookend to his career in westerns. He was 62 when he directed and starred in Unforgiven. He plays a former gunslinger named William Munny. He has long been settled down and away from that life. He married and had children and he has become a hog farmer. He is widowed and just trying to live out his days in peace, when he is lured back into a violent world. Unforgiven is its own story - well crafted and independent. But it shows influences and pays homage to almost every film on this list - most particularly Shane. The film respectfully illustrates the difference between truth and legend, as Munny tries to live down the mythology that grew about his younger self - the mythology that many earlier westerns were built around. Unforgiven manages to both dispel and live up to that mythology.  1. The Searchers (1956) - New York Magazine referred to The Searchers as the most influential film in the history of film. The Searchers was the ninth collaboration of director John Ford and actor John Wayne. It is based on the novel by Alan Le May, which, in turn, was based on the real historical Parker massacre and capture of Cynthia Parker by Comanche Indians. Wayne is compelling as Ethan Edwards, the uncle of a missing girl. He undertakes a years long search for his niece. His character hates the Comanche. He is unrepentantly racist towards them - hating them so much that he sees his mission as to find his niece and mercifully kill her because she will have been corrupted by the Indians.
