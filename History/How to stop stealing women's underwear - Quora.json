            "answer_text": "It seems as simple as just not stealing. But my question is more of why are you stealing them? Are you too young to be able to earn money to get your own? I can sympathize with that as I was in the same situation in my teens. Your best bet if this is the case is to get help from your mother if possible. If she is understanding she will be able to help you. If she is not I would recommend you get some money to \u201cgo out\u201d and either buy them yourself or enlist the aid of a trusted friend to use the money to buy them for you. It's a tough slog\u2026and super embarassing, I know. But you will be better off in the long run. I wish I had gotten the help of my mom as I know she would have helped me. If you aren't in this situation and are old enough to buy your own\u2026then you have no damn excuse. Go get your own\u2026tell them it's for your girlfriend or wife or whatever. If you have a job or the ability to get a job there is no excuse to invade a woman's privacy like that. ",

            "answer_text": "This can become a slippery slope for you that can cause problems with who you are stealing panties from. If you are old enough maybe just go out and buy your own in stores or online, which ever your more comfortable with. If you are a minor (teenager) then you might want to turn to your mom, this is not going to be easy to do but it might help. You can get your own panties and not worry about the trouble you could get into. If it\u2019s worn panties that you are stealing then it could be even more difficult to stop, buying your own panties is not going to give you what your looking for. I know this because that\u2019s how my panty addiction was. It was fun and a rush going through a panty draw but what I really wanted was a dirty pair of panties to enjoy the scent woman leave in their panties. You can try buying worn panties on the internet, it\u2019s pretty common. I have never done it but spoke with others that have and satisfaction was 50/50. I hurt some relationships with some people stealing their panties it was lucky enough for it not to become a major problem, the ones that caught me either asked for me to stop, moved their laundry basket and one even left a note in her panty draw. It said I like my panties too please stop taking them. This was about a 30 year addiction that I was able to hide from my wife and she still doesn\u2019t know about me stealing panties, she knows I wear them that\u2019s it. She has no idea I grabbed panties from her mom, cousins, friends and sometimes complete strangers, heck I was stealing her panties when we were dating. Eventually I realized I needed to stop before I got in serious trouble. I gave up hiding my panty wearing from my wife got rid of my men\u2019s underwear and started wearing only panties. My wife was ok with it from the start and she got turned on with me wearing panties and we incorporate panties in our sexual pleasure. I was able to enjoy panties sexually without just masturbation, this helped make it easier to stop. Once I had nothing to hide the taboo feelings went away and eventually the desire to take other women\u2019s underwear also went away. Don\u2019t get me wrong I do think of it from time to time, especially if I\u2019m over the house of someone I use to steal panties from, but I resist. It has gotten easier over time to not think much about it because I found a more positive way to enjoy panty wearing. I found a new Panty thrill panty shopping with my wife. Going through the panty bins at VS is fun and exciting especially when my wife is picking out my panties. It can be difficult sometimes to not get aroused while shopping and We love the look on a salesgirls face when she realizes the panties are for me. Basically you need to find a way to convince your brain another way other than stealing panties to get a panty thrill ",

            "answer_text": "Buy your own in the styles that you like is a great place to start. Why steal anything in the first place that is wrong. Asking someone to try on their underwear is one thing, but stealing is a hole different thing. My suggestion is to either buy your own from a store, or go online, and shop. It is very easy to do this either way. Also by buying your own you can pick, and choose from a variety of different styles, colors, and fabrics that you will enjoy wearing. ",

Since you obviously have some since you \u201cborrowed\u201d them, see which ones you like and what sizes and buy them for yourself online. ",
