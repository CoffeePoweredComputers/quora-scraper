            "answer_text": "In the early 1900s (1910-1959 aprx), \"insanity\" was anyone who's behaviour couldn't be explained as \"normal\", so people assumed \"they must have some mental defect\". Even in the 1800s. That's why they had Batman-esq/Lovecraftian insane asylums.1960s-1980s/90s(?)-They started to understand mental illness better, nut not enough. 1960s were the era of psychedelic psychotherapy, or \"stoning people to make them open up\" (stoning as in LSD. Not kidding about that). It got somewhat better, but up until recently, mental illness wasn't really understood at all that well.So it's very different. ",
