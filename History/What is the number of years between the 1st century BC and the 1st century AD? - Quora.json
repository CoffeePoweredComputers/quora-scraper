            "answer_text": "There were none as in zero. There was no year zero in Rome. They made the calendar we have today. The calendar has been updated since to make it more accurate. We now write the without the use of Roman numerals. This allows for us to write years ending zero. Like 100 AD, 1910 AD, and 2000 AD. The Romans went directly from 1 BC TO 1 AD. This why a decade is measured in as 2001 through 2010, 2011 - 2020, and so on a decade counts from 1 to 10, not 00 to 09. Our current decade does not end in 2019 but rather at midnight December 31st 2020. We then start over at January 1st 2021.

In this system, the year 1 BC is followed by AD 1. ",
