            "answer_text": "See, this is Exactly the Problem with modern day Society. There\u2019s Too much complacency and Ignorance. Everyone just accepts what they are told and No One Questions Anything. We need to start Questioning more, and accepting less. A Child repeatedly asks, \u201cWhy?\u201d He\u2019s Not truly interested in Why, he just wants a better explanation. It\u2019s a test of Parent\u2019s Patience. We need to start asking, \u201cBut Why?\u201d more often. With the intention, of discovering Real answers. If you know and Understand REAL Science, then you would realize there\u2019s a Fleet load of things to discover. Exotic materials is one subject. AntiGravity is another. The list is nearly endless. Start by getting a proper education in the Sciences: Physics, Chemistry, Electricity, Materials, etc. Hint: Electrical voltage at a specific frequency alters the atomic structure of a material, leading to new, previously unknown substances.

            "answer_text": "Well let\u2019s just say that this whole world is an inner reflection of you and this system we live is all interconnected. There are laws to this reality but what are they? All the problems in the world are due to our disparity of form with these laws yet you hold the key to uncover these laws deep within you and be apart of the process as an active component. Yes there is much to discover on the outside but for you my friend there is a whole world underneath what you see and it still needs to be discovered. What is the purpose of my life and where do I fit in to this galactic process.  ",
