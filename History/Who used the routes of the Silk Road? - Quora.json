            "answer_text": "Contrary to the stereotype, few merchants did a \u2018Marco Polo\u2019, traveling the full length of the Road. The further you went the more alien the conditions, languages, customs, etc. \u2026..very dangerous for a foreigner. The \u201cSilk Road\u2019 was primarily a relay race, with each merchant having a specific section that he was familiar with. He\u2019d buy the products from a merchant at one end of his \u2018leg\u2019, decide what the best route would be at that time, and then sell the merchandise at the far end of his route to another merchant, adding in his costs. The new buyer would then cover the next leg. This resulted in many layers of middlemen and much higher costs, of course. The later ocean routes allowed for much larger cargoes than a camel could carry and fewer middlemen, and a greater profit margin for the ships\u2019 backers. The death knell of the old Silk Road. And without the middleman profits to sustain them, the trade cities along the old Road collapsed into backwaters with glorious old buildings but threadbare economies. . . ",

            "answer_text": "Whoever conducted trade between China and the West. Since the Muslim kingdoms which controlled most of central Asia banned Christians from conducting trade in their territories, Muslim (Persians, Bukharans etc.) or Jewish traders controlled the trade caravans across Asia until they reached the Mediterranean or the Persian Gulf/Arabian Sea. From the former they were shipped to Europe, from the latter to Arabia or the Red Sea, and from there across Africa on caravans. The southernmost ports in Africa on these trade routes were Zanzibar and Sophalala, at the mouth of the Zambezi, near modern day Beira. Once Europeans discovered sea routes to the Far East, the Silk Road lost its importance. ",
