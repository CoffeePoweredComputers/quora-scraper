            "answer_text": "Why are Islamists targeting France so aggressively in recent years? Because they hate us. For several reasons : France is the motherland of the modern European civilization. And the secularism, arts, culture, education, freedom, equality that we enjoy today, even the laicity that annoys us sometimes but annoys Islamist so much more, are offenses to the very idea of Islamic rule over the World.France made a ridiculous mess with the U.K out of greed by cutting the Middle-East pie to pillage what was once the Ottoman Empire, instead of supervising a proper dismantling accordingly to both ethnic-maps and common sense in term of viability and non-redundance of the created States. That\u2019s an easy blame to pin on us.France had also a bloody decolonization war in Algeria in 1954\u20131962, leaving 250,000 to 300,000 dead Arabs/Muslims. Lives matter, hundred of thousands of deaths even more, especially when you seek for reasons to hate and seek something to take revenge from.We left because they didn\u2019t want us anymore : we should not make the mistake of taking/keeping them either, unless they are willing and committed to assimilate.France also allowed million of Muslims to flood our country, but could not assimilate most of them, due to irreductible civilizational differences, a failed policy of ghettoization, which led to communautarism, and a failed integration into the French society.Assimilation of non assimilable elements failed, integration is a failure and a danger per se. We need to be the masters in our own home, and the guests need to assimilate, or at least behave as such, and if not : just take the door.France ultimately played alongside the U.S.A to some war-games with Muslims, in ex-Yugoslavia then in the Middle-East and North African zone. Helping them, killing them, helping them, killing them, Muslims only remember the killings, and forget the help, which is perfectly understandable.If I was a proud Muslim, and saw French and other Western countries mess in our business, bomb my Muslim country, and then tell me about democracy, freedom (horror !), and human rights, I\u2019d laugh hatefully, and indoctrinate a few kids for a few years to then send them to blow themselves in France, make a rampage with automatic weapons or make a \u201cMiddle-Eastern drive-in\u201d on haram meat, so the French people enjoy a taste of its own State medicine : \u201cbleed, pigs !\u201d In the name of Allah, of course.Nothing illogical there, we should stop to try to give lessons of :whatever: to everyone, mind our own business, and let the Middle-East solve its own issues and evolve toward civilization over millions of dead bodies. Like we did. But by themselves, not because of ourselves. Like we did. Sovereign History is the best kind of pedagogy on the macroscopic and long term History.Universalism is dead and France can\u2019t carry that anymore, nor is legitimate to do so under our own principles, time is to multilateralism, live, let live, and also\u2026 let die.So, back to our terror attacks (those against us, not those of our planes against other countries !) : Charlie Hebdo redaction was targeted because they dared to mock Islam, caricature the Prophet, and turn the Muslims into idiots through their satiric magazine. Can you imagine fanatics reading Charlie Hebdo ? Having so many of them on our soil, that ended up badly.The Bataclan, concert-hall which was attacked, is a place of musical entertainment, 2 things hated by Islamist fundamentalists. A perfect place for a carnage. They wanted to do that in the \u201cStadium of France\u201d also, during a football match, but thanks God and our policemen, it failed.And the fireworks of the 14 of July in Nice are a celebration of our \u201cBastille Day\u201d, which reminds us of the French revolution, and what it brought to us and Europe : coming there with a truck and make a carnage, GTA style, was the least Islamist could do to make us a bloody prank. Personally, I think we should sort our own Muslims and trash those who support fundamentalism, Al-Qaida, ISIS, the idea of a caliphate, etc, along our African and Arab convicts who overcrowd our prisons, back in the tribal lands of Libya, for example : the country doesn\u2019t even exist anymore, because we destroyed it, so\u2026 a little less, a little more, who cares ? They\u2019ll handle their own issues together. With those who don\u2019t, and value France beyond anything else / keep their faith as a sole faith, without political agenda, we can live and prosper, no problem. Then, remove French forces from any operation which is not : on European territory, in help for secular Christians.in the Middle-East, in the protection of the Oriental Christians of which France is supposed to be the traditional protector, and not the enemy (France betrayed its role with the Syrian Christians, as it did with the Serbs already in the 90s, by supporting Islamists against the government of Bachar El Assad (we tried hard, but could not destroy that country : Good job, Syria, Iran and Russia !)).or at the request of the lawful government of a recognized State who\u2019d ask us for help to preserve its borders or the very existence of the State.Exit the non consensual meddling in countries like in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Libya or Syria. Exit the support to Muslim insurgents or guerrilla. Exit bombing Muslim populated countries cities, let alone Christian populated cities for the sake of Muslims (!!!). We need to sever ties with the Muslim World to fair-trade only, and prevent its arrival at home. De Gaulle Arab policy was a mistake, we should have partitioned Algeria in 1962, then supported the Israeli in 1967 : France has nothing to do with Islam. Protect ourselves, support our own, our civilizational kin and close allies, and those we historically pledged our support to before WW2, send everyone else to fuck off when they are coming with their list of problems to bring upon us, and mind our own business, while not trying to steal what does not belong to us, or help others to do so, and acting both with reason and fairness : that should be the base principles of the French domestic and foreign policy.

            "answer_text": "Some of the answers here already have it right, here it is backed up by a guy who was 10 years in charge of the antiterrorist judicial cluster in France (breathtaking article for French speakers: Le juge Tr\u00e9vidic -- \"La France est l'ennemi num\u00e9ro un de l'Etat islamique\"). His blood-curdling statement is that \"France is public enemy number one for Daech\" and he gives a list of structural, political and ideological reasons for that. First of all, France is vulnerable, thus an easy target for terrorists. Its situation at the core of Europe in the Schengen space makes it operationally more actionable to send guys that are just back from their training in Syria to commit attacks.  The United States would of course be the prime target, but they have successfully achieved to protect the country against attacks through a number of antiterrorist measures and organizations that have the means to fight efficiently against those threats. France also has a number of antiterrorist organizations, but the former judge claims here that the material means are ridiculously poor regarding what would be needed to actually fight terrorism in an efficient manner. Investigators are overwhelmed and cannot push their efforts to the limits on every case. Making it easy for some to slip through the cracks. Politically and ideologically speaking, France is also a target of choice for the attacks. France has become one of the most loyal ally of the United States in the war against terror, sent air raids against ISIS in Irak, took actions in Syria, in Mali also (against another terrorist network -- but hey, I guess there's diligence between rotten minds). France is also an ally of Israel, which adds to the reasons for ISIS to take action against it. France stands for a number of ideals (accurate or just speculate) that Daech fights against or disapproves: universal freedom and equality, a Western lifestyle that they regard as depraved. It is also a former colonial nation with a lot of internal debates regarding national identity: we have seen a right-wing French politician recently reminding how France was a Judeo-Chrisitan country of white race (this may sound normal to American citizens, but the word race is terribly negatively connotated in France), and this is merely the latest example of all the fuss about this topic. That internal debate has been going on for quite a few years now and (in my humble opinion) amounts to nothing except hurting the feelings of French citizens from ethnic minorities (whatever they are) and turn the people against each other in an overall deleterious environment, unfortunately prone to such dreadful events. The worst part about the interview though (dating from September 2015) is that according to this expert, we're only at the beginning of what can happen to France, that Daech is determined to systematically and hardly strike France -- and that the next step might well be one of major scale (think 9/11). This sends shivers down the spine. I can only hope our politicians will take exceptional measures to efficiently fight this horror. ",
