            "answer_text": "Hoo boy, this is quite difficult to answer. The sharpest blade comes in a variety of answers depending on the context. So far, one of the sharpest blades in the world that I know of (barring certain graphene blades) would have to be a piece of blackish-brownish volcanic glass known as obsidian. It\u2019s so sharp that it\u2019s sometimes used in scalpels, and was used by certain cultures in their weapons\u2026most notably in the Aztec macuahuitl, a large, paddle-shaped club studded with obsidian prisms. As far as swords go (and given what I know from \u201cForged in Fire\u201d and \u201cMan at Arms\u201d), that all depends on a lot of factors, key of which being the following: A practical sword needs to hit a lot of sweet spots to be perfect, but the biggest sweet spot to achieve has to be between sharpness and durability: too much sharpness and you might as well be swinging around a piece of glass; too much durability, and you may as well ditch the sword and get yourself an axe.There\u2019s a reason why we\u2019ve graduated from bronze, to iron, to steel over the years we\u2019ve been using blades, and that\u2019s because softer materials tend to lose sharpness rather quickly. A katana, for example, is a rather good blade because of multiple materials used to make it: it has a high-carbon steel edge that\u2019d stay sharp longer, and a lower-carbon steel spine and core to absorb impact better (especially with the copper, maybe gold habaki helping it along). That said, a sword doesn\u2019t need to be made of steel to be razor-sharp so long as you\u2019ve got a smith and a swordsman that knows what they\u2019re doing.That being said, I believe the sharpest sword that I can think of is the Sword of King Goujian.

            "answer_text": "Steel can only be sharpened to a degree allowed by it\u2019s molecular structure. About as sharp as a commercial razor blade\u2026 If you look at such a blade under an electron microscope\u2026It looks pretty much like a tree saw blade. Lots of little jagged points. When the blade is sharp, the little points all are in the same direction. When dull, they are all broken or bent over. The Japanese woodworkers have a competition yearly where they sharpen their tools to the greatest degree possible, and cut amazingly long and uniform paper-thin shavings from test boards\u2026. But as the other answers note, these edges do not last long. You certainly wouldn\u2019t want one on hardly any functional knife as it would very rapidly dull doing most tasks. A practical edge combines a useful degree of sharpness with durability. So far as I know, the sharpest edges are still glass/obsidian. These materials fracture down to the molecular level. Surgeons still use obsidian scalpel blades for certain types of very delicate surgery. ",
