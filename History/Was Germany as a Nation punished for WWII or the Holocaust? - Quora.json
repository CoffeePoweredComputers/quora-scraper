            "answer_text": "That is a very tricky question. I do not agree that Germany was punished by bombing its cities. The mass-bombing of cities was a German invention. Just ask someone living in Guernica, Coventry, Warsaw or Rotterdam. That was no punishment, but just warefare. The allies were able to do so, so why should they do not bomb German cities like the German Luftwaffe did it when it was able to do so. That the German population and / or soldiers did not know anything about the holocaust is ridiculous, too. Wehrmacht units were often involved in the killings. There are tons of films and photos taken by Wehrmacht soldiers showing atrocities. Every citizen witnessed that jews disappeared. In rural areas, there were POW camps, where especially Russian and later Italian POWs were starved and worked to dead. It is true that Germany lost a lot of his territories, and that the Germans who were living there lost their homes, were suppressed by the new Polish, Czeck and Russian rulers and had a hard march to the new German territories. And off course I know that especially the Red army killed, imprisoned and raped innocent people on their way to Berlin. Still, this was no punishment. The ordinary soldier of the mighty Red Army just did what the German Wehrmacht did in the Ukraine and Western Russia some years before. And to be honest, I would prefer to live in a German village which is conquered by the Red Army than to live in an Ukranian village conquered by the Wehrmacht. There have been plans to punish Germany. The allies thought about removing all industrial facillities from Germany, turning it in a large farm. Another idea was to divide Germany into single states (e.g. Bavaria, Hanover, Hesse, Saxony etc.) again. Or to give large parts of Germany to neighbouring countries (like the whole Emsland to the Netherlands, Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark etc.). All those plans were not executed. The top-Nazis were put on trial in Nuremburg. A lot of concentration camp guards and leaders were executed, not only in Germany but in Poland and the CSSR too. But, to make a long answer short: Germany was not punished. Because there was a new war going on: The cold war beteween the West and the East. The USA needed the FRG as a an stronghold against the Warsaw pact. So they build up Western Germany with a lot of money. If some civil servant had been in the Nazi-Party? Who cares, as long as he is loyal, did not have killed any jews himself and is a good worker. For example, Reinhard Gehlen, first head of the new West-German secret service \u201cBundesnachrichtendienst\u201d, was a former General-Major in the secret service of the third Reich. And, even if some brave communists will not believe it, it was the same in the East-German GDR. ",

            "answer_text": "They were punished for both. I think the fact that Germany was divided for decades with East Germany\u2019s use of force against the people was enough of a punishment for Germans. Even as somebody who is German by blood and Jewish by ethnicity, I do not feel that the ordinary German person should be punished because the Holocaust and WWII was the fault of the Hitler regime and once the camps were liberated, the German people themselves were horrified about the things their government did. After the war, Germany had a lot of issues and I feel that they do not deserve to be punished. ",
