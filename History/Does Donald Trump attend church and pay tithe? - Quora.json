            "answer_text": "as a child, Donald and his family (Mom/Dad) attended Marble Collegiate church pastored by the late great Normal Vincent Peale - author of the Power of Positive Thinking. That was the only real religious education experience he has ever had, and since early adulthood, he has never attended church other than special occasions. So no, Donald doesn\u2019t tithe or attend church. To quote his comments made after the national prayer group got together and laid hands on him and prayed, he later said in his office \u201cCan you believe people actually believe that bullshit\u201d\u2026. which pretty much sums up what he \u201creally\u201d thinks about religion in general. Yes, He plays it well to the hard core bible thumpers and they actually believe he\u2019s in their camp and on their side. Foolish people! ",

            "answer_text": "During his campaign, he claimed membership in a Presbyterian church that says he has visited there a time or two but never consistently and was certainly never a member. His spiritual upbringing was not anything like orthodox Christianity, and he has never professed anything I\u2019ve heard that indicates he comprehends the Gospel or that God has saved him. That, of course, is something no one but he can judge, but the outward evidence certainly isn\u2019t overwhelmingly in favor of his being a Christian. ",

If he actually bothered to read the Bible he would find that it tells us to \u201cRender unto Caesar that which is Caesar\u2019s and unto God that which is God\u2019s.\u201d Caesar of course meaning government. So the Bible essentially tells us to pay our taxes and our tithes. If he doesn\u2019t care about doing one, it stands to reason he wouldn\u2019t care about doing the other either. ",
