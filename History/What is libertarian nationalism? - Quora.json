            "answer_text": "Libertarian Nationalism is a political movement that\u2019s already been around for a while: Libertarian Nationalism. It\u2019s basically an alt-right ideology, and after reading some of the stuff on that Facebook site and other blogs on the subject, it\u2019s really not much more than a slightly liberalized version of National Socialism. My political theory is National Libertarianism\u2014an idea that focuses on the libertarian ideal of a small government and virtually unlimited personal freedoms for citizens of a nation, as long as it doesn\u2019t infringe on anyone else\u2019s rights. However, the \u201cNational\u201d part comes from the fact that, differently from the U.S. Libertarian Party, National Libertarianism focuses inwardly (Nationalism) rather than outwardly (Globalism), and outright rejects anarchy. We believe in personal freedom, but we also believe in law and order. If you abuse your freedom and screw with someone else\u2019s life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, we\u2019ll throw your ass in jail. You want to smoke dope in the privacy of your own home? Have at it. But if you give dope to a 10 year-old who can\u2019t make an informed choice, you\u2019re a monster who\u2019s going to a cage. We believe in national self-sufficiency; the idea that a great nation should be able to provide and manufacture what it needs from its own resources. We believe that all of a nation\u2019s citizens make up the body of the nation and have something to offer it; a National Libertarian doesn\u2019t believe in \u201cAfrican-Americans,\u201d or \u201cJapanese-Americans,\u201d or \u201cWhite Americans,\u201d or anything else\u2014we believe in Americans. And we don\u2019t believe in \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d because we\u2019re already the greatest nation the world has ever seen\u2014we went from nothing to an empire in a human lifetime (1776\u20131848), and by 1944 we were the most powerful nation the world had ever seen. And have you ever wondered why most modern countries have a President as their head of state? Because we invented the concept in our Constitution 230 years ago. No, we don\u2019t need to Make America Great Again. Screw that and the person who came up with it and their divisive politics. We need to Make America Greater. And we\u2019ve given that idea up, with the imposition of social democratic concepts during the 20th century and the concomitant race to mediocrity. A great nation doesn\u2019t impose a $15/hour minimum wage because hard-working people who want to work can\u2019t find a job that delivers a wage that can support their families. A great nation says \u201cIt is UNACCEPTABLE that in a nation as great and powerful as ours, that hardworking American citizens can\u2019t find good jobs that justifiably EARN them a living wage!\u201d And one of the big reasons why this unacceptable thing has happened is because the United States of America got away from the Nationalism that made us the greatest nation on Earth. After we won World War II, through the efforts of our own fighting men and our own industry and technology that rearmed and fed our allies in Britain, France, Russia and China when they needed our help, we lost sight of America after the war. We\u2019ve spent the last 72 years assuming responsibilities around the world that aren\u2019t our concern, defending umpteen nations that don\u2019t like or respect us, outsourcing jobs and industry to other nations with no tangible benefit to us, and piling up debt while eroding our own national consciousness. The country that became an Empire in its first 72 years has been everyone else\u2019s stooge for the last 72. NO MORE! National Libertarianism. Liberty for all the citizens of our Republic, and a rebirth of our national consciousness\u2014only greater than ever before, because no one who can call themselves an American is excluded, like was mistakenly done in the past. Free speech, free expression, the unfettered right to bear arms to defend your person and your Republic from tyranny, social deviants, and external enemies. The Constitution as it was intended, Federalism as it was intended, Justice as it was intended, and every adult who is willing to put in an honest day\u2019s work should have the ability to earn an honest day\u2019s pay, because the globalists can\u2019t send their jobs 10,000 miles away anymore. (They can always send themselves 10,000 miles away, and find some other country to ruin.) ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s the result of some severe case of cognitive dissonance. The idea that one can maintain any national pride while advocating for a society that operates on the level of an individual is one that is deeply flawed. Nah, I\u2019m kidding. You will find as you read more about politics (and I heavily encourage you to) that all political labels are just a game of semantics. Focus on finding the policies you believe to be correct, and don\u2019t restrict what\u2019s palatable to the parameters of some category you find yourself in. I myself found it cliche to agree with the notion that the best policies emerge from the center, and I largely still agree with that. Neutrality bias, as they say. But you will find policies from the other side of the political spectrum that might actually be of some value to you. At the very least, you can apply some principle to your own politics. Per the question, really it\u2019s just a conservative with libertarian persuasions. ",
