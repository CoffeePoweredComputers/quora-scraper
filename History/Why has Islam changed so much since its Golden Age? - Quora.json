            "answer_text": "First off I would like to recommend the book Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes by Tamim Ansary which does a wonderful job explaining this transition and is also very enjoyable to read. Essentially this particular issue came about especially as Europe was emerging into their own Rennaisance (which the Muslim empires had already undergone) which the Islamic empires didn't keep pace with.  The Islamic empires were streched thin with the central authority becoming weak and various smaller powers rising and then experiencing in-fighting withing the Islamic world.  Such things left the fractured kingdoms or principalities divided and weak and made easy things like the Reconquest of Spain in the west and the invasion of the Mongolian Horde in the East which was pretty devestating on all fronts, not to mention various crusade invasions which caused turmoil in the more central regions. Most of the Islamic world had been the leaders in science, mathematics, manufacturing, etc... for quite a while at this point so there was a lot of overconfidence in their abilities and discoveries.  For example they were slower to get on board with printing presses and machines that would take care of some manufacturing things because they already had many employed to hand copy volumes and didnt see the value or potential of  those things till it was too late to be a leading force.  The leaders were overconfident in their military skills and even turned down weapons that were than latter sold by inventors to their enemies which helped those enemies push back and fight against the Islamic empires armies. The failures, fractured government system, dissatisfaction from the people and weak central government which was overstretched led to the whole region eventually being ripe to colonialization which further divided and carved up the area into different regions and countries.  The once unified Dar al-Islam became weak and seperate.  This was again further expounded upon after the world wars and the creation of Israel in Palestine. Any time that there has been some hardship and failure Muslims have tried to find answers (some of which are easier to pinpoint in hindsight) and they look to scripture for answers.  \"If we are believers and we are failing is it because we are not implementing our beliefs properly?\"  As such there have been several Islamic movements that attempted to reform or fundamentalize religion.  Many believed their failures as an empire and subsequent subjugation to things like colonialism were a result of failure to properly apply Islam and resulted from too lax a society (some of which was true).  So many believed that a return to a more strict following of Islam would return them to the success of the early Muslim community but fractured as they were there was no longer a central authoity figure to follow either religiously or politically (early Mulsims had one authority figure who spoke for religious and well as political issues where as latter ones had separated into a religious head and a political head).  There was no united global Ummah anymore and as such many ideas about how to return to a purer form of Islam developed and many were more harsh and strict as a result of wanting to elimiate all those factors that they believed caused the original downfall of the empires.  In theMiddle East many turned to a more strict interpretation under more totalitarian systems many under leaders  who themselves were greedy and corrupt thus incapable of creating a truely just society for the Muslim Ummah in the first place.

            "answer_text": "Islam hasn't change. Its philosophy, its teachings and the rules to follow are same. Its the people who have changed.Islam has been divided into several sects and each one of them is calling the other as non-muslim. They are all hungry for power and money and in the way they are picturing a fierce picture of Islam. Do you think that ISI is Islam? or the way people are blowing themselves killing innocent lives is Islam? No way that could be true.The top Islamic scholars have given statement against all these acts. Now why the Muslims couldn't develop at the pace of the Europeans is due to the lack of foresightedness by the rulers at that time. Printing press was invented in Roman empire but the Muslim rulers didn't bother to get the advantage of it and spread books of knowledge around their kingdom. Similarly they denied to adopt other technologies and inventions which kept them slow in progressing in all fields of life. Slowly and gradually the Muslim empire started to collapse and after world war it was divided into several countries which made few countries quite rich of resources like the middle east and left many in poor conditions. The rich countries then started relying on westerners for their development, they had oil money and they spent that lavishly to develop their countries but never tried to develop the mental state of their people which resulted in more influx from the west.
