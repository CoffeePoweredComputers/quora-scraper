            "answer_text": "I\u2019m far from an expert on the subject, but here\u2019s the simple version. First, we need to define what a nation is, and what a state is. A nation is a stable group of people with a common language, history, and culture. So we could speak of the Swedish nation, but also of the Kurdish nation. A state is a government that controls a certain territory and is recognized by other nations as such. Sweden and the UK are both states. A nation-state is a nation that has its own state. There can be minority groups, but the people of the nation dominate the state, chiefly in terms of politics, but also economically, socially, etc. More formally, we sometimes call nation-states Westphalian nation-states, because the concept can be traced back to the Treaty of Westphalia that ended the Thirty Years War in 1648. Sweden would be a typical example of a nation-state. Swedish people dominate the Swedish state. They hold most of the political and economic power, and their worldview and preferences strongly affect the decisions made by the state. The things the Swedish state does have a Swedish character to them. The UK, on the other hand, is at least arguably not a nation-state, and never has been. The reason is that for the entirety of its existence, it has contained multiple nations: the English, Welsh, and Scots, and you could also argue that there are other nations, the Cornish for example. Ireland was (officially) added later, and of course until quite recently the UK government had a lot of practical control over many other nations in places like India and Africa. The only way you can plausibly argue that the UK was or is a nation-state is to argue that the English were or are so dominant that the state only reflects their preferences, ignoring the other nations, even the ones that had meaningful voting power. I think it\u2019s safe to say this is a minority view. At the very least, Scots have always had significant political power in the UK Thus, the UK is a state that is not a nation state. You could give it other labels; you could call it an empire historically as it indeed was. I am not familiar with Professor Snyder, so I have nothing to say about what he thinks implications of this are. ",

            "answer_text": "A nation state is one in which the people share a common language, history and culture : clearly that does not now apply to the United Kingdom, nor has it ever done so. Westminster\u2019s complete indifference to the plight of the Irish Goidelic Celts during, the great starvation, also known as, \u201cthe Irish potato famine,\u201d although there was in fact no famine as vast quantities of grain and livestock which could have been used for famine relief were exported, led to the breakup of Ireland, with six of Ulster\u2019s nine counties opting to remain with the U.K.. However that outcome has been thrown into question again as there are now more Catholic Nationalists in Northern Ireland than there are Protestant Unionists a fact which was borne out in the E.U. referendum when the Catholic Nationalist areas voted overwhelmingly to remain in the E.U. and the Protestant Loyalist constituencies voted to Leave the E.U., the overall vote was 55% remain to 45% leave.. Scotland, also expressed it\u2019s, \u201csovereign will,\u201d to remain in the E.U. with every constituency voting to remain by an overall majority of 62% to 38%.. Wales (surprisingly) voted by a narrow majority 52% to 48% to leave the E.U. although that could possibly be explained by the large number of English people who live in the Welsh Marches which abut England. When it became clear that a no deal Brexit on W.T.O. terms would have a devastating impact on the Welsh agricultural sector the Welsh First Minister stated that it would have been better for Wales to remain in the E.U. than to leave with a hard Brexit. Clearly, the United Kingdom is currently in the throes of a constitutional crisis brought about by the Westminster governments determination to pursue a hard Brexit regardless of the potential cost to the Union. The Nationalists in Ireland (who are presently in the majority) have no wish to see a return to a hard border with the Republic and the Scots are aggrieved that their, \u201csovereign will,\u201d to remain in the E.U. has been ignored so it is highly probable that the so called United Kingdom will cease to exist in short order.

The \u2018Nation State\u2019 as it is generally understood is a misnomer in today\u2019s, and yesterday\u2019s, world for nowhere on the planet is there, or has there ever been, a nation vested with a constitutional right of eminent domain, ultimate authority that is conditionally transferred in perpetuity to State authority figures as long as they observe statutory conditions (enumerated in a written constitution). The bulk of the world\u2019s populations entertain the misconception that they live in nation States when in fact their status is that of a disinherited human being subject to the direction of a territorial State\u2019s authority figures (in the UK subjects of the Monarch, Elizabethans subject to government diktat by virtue of Parliament\u2019s appropriation of royal prerogatives) and those who can exercise financial coercion over them. Nations do not have an eventual power of eminent domain (ultimate authority), those in charge of the State do and they claim it unilaterally not subjectively because of the willing acquiescence by the individuals that compose the polity in a presumption that the sum of individuals who form a population cannot be collectively possessed of eminent domain (through a social contract - a constitution in which they conditionally cede eminent domain to an elected government) over the common domain that is the land of their birth.

He argues that there was a British Empire and then Britain joined the European Union. He believes that Britishness has never really existed. He implies that national sovereignty is overrated and the British should forget about self-determination and accept the United States of Europe. He does not seem keen on democracy or giving voters the right to decide their future. I have met factory workers with a better understanding of 20th-century European history than Snyder. ",
