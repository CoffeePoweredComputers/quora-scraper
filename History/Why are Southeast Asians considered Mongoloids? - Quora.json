            "answer_text": "The simple answer is that if you make a system of categorization with three or four main categories then you have to put every individual into one or the other of them. The only way out is to do as you suggest, and you get an additional category. The division of the world into those simple categories was done on the basis of the kinds of things that people could measure at the time. There is no reason to hold onto them as though they were some assertion in your bible or somebody else\u2019s bible. We now have great deal of data on the genetic high-frequency items for various populations, and we can see, generally speaking, where the many different groups of South-East Asians each came from. It\u2019s a bit crazy to think that, e.g., the several minority populations and the main population groups now found in Thailand all came together, all walked hand in hand from some distant place and arrived in an empty Thailand together. Some groups came down from China. Some groups may have come across from the west, i.e., somewhere in the direction of India. Some may have come down from Taiwan (the aborigines, not the much later Han Chinese settlers) around in a sort of circular route through the various islands and then into Thailand from the South-East. The visibility of some of these groups may have totally fuzzed out into the general population. Maybe the average Thai of today is 5% Taiwanese aborigine in ancestry. Who knows unless somebody does the research? One way to categorize people that give some idea of where their ancestors came from, and by what route, and how they connect back to the original humans is to trace the Y-chromosome DNA because that never comes from the mother\u2019s side of the family and you can look for changes that occur over the history of the human diaspora from Africa, and that can be associated with geography.  If you wanted you could go back for a look at the maternal grandfathers on the maternal side of somebody\u2019s family tree and get some kind of an idea of where all the females lines of descent came from, and you could check out the mitochondrial DNA. But just as a simplification of a more complicated picture, this picture is already complicated enough to ask an important question: Why would you put some of these lines of descent together and call them \u201cMongoloid?\u201d Would we split all 12 into three groups of 4, or 4 groups of 3, or make uneven groupings, some [race] having only 1 or 2 components, some having 6 or 7, or what? If the world is characterized by the areas of heaviest percentages of the various genetic markers that have been found useful, a map appears, as shown in the Wikipedia article (Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup - Wikipedia) You can get a readable version of the map going to File:World Map of Y-DNA Haplogroups.png and then clicking on \u201cOriginal file.\u201d While you are there, note that a group that \u201ceverybody knows\u201d are homogeneous, the Chinese, are split into at least 3 groups.  How many groups constitute \u201cSouth-East Asia\u201d probably depends on where you draw your own boundary line. It looks like at least four to me. And \u201cMongoloid?\u201d Don\u2019t forget to count the groups in the Americas if you try to find out how complex that so-called main division is. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Southeast Asians are Mongoloids. The modern term Mongoloid is a human classification based on the common ancestries and genetic similarity of Eastern Eurasians of the Far East, Most Pacific Islanders, and sometimes Native Americans.  Race is real as a convenient concept for humans to classify diverse physical characteristics. Yes, in reality we might have diverse ancestries from different regions. In reality, race is too blurry, for example where we try to classify \u201cborderland\u201d ethnic groups where they looked \u201cmixed race\u201d; ie. central Asians. But there are common ancestries, haplogroups, etc. that can help us to classify human groups. Based on dentitions classification, most Southeast Asians are \u201cSundadont Mongoloids\u201d while Northeast Asians are \u201cSinodont Mongoloids\u201d.  If you refer to the the Negrito people, they are one of the earliest inhabitants of the Sundaland and Sahul region, along with the Papuans and Australian Aborigines. Southeast Asians have darker skin, and less prominent epichantic folds compared to Northern Asians, might also have been because of adaptations to a warmer, cloudier, tropical climate. Muja Harahap's answer to Why do Southeast Asians have big eyes? Southeast Asians do have some Negrito genes. But most genetic origins of Southeast Asians (SEA Mainlanders and SEA Islanders) come from what is known in modern day as China. For example the Austronesians, come from what is today, Mainland China, later crossing the strait to Taiwan and expanded, to Madagascar (Africa) in the west and Easter Island (Oceania) in the east.[1]  Despite the darker skin tone, most Southeast Asians today are more closely related to Eastern Asia and Polynesia rather than the Negritos. Central/Eastern Indonesians such as the Mollucans have mixed Papuan/Southeast Asian genes, but western Indonesians, for example, the Javanese, are closer in genetics to the people of Indochina, Malaysia, and the Philippines. [2]  [Haplogroup O-M175 - Wikipedia] One of the articles on The Conversation about The diverse genetic population of Indonesian people explain this subject more in depth. Based on the article, there are three genetic markers that can be used to study human migration. Y chromosome, inherited DNA from father to son.Mitochondrial DNA, inherited by mothers to the children.Autosomal DNA, inherited from both parents.Using mitocondrial DNA, we found haplogroups M, F, Y2 and B in the western part of Indonesia. The people of these haplogroups are mostly speakers of Austronesia languages, spoken in Southeast Asia, Madagascar and Pacific Islands. Meanwhile in the eastern part of Indonesia we found haplogroups Q and P. These two haplogroups are unique to people of Papua and Nusa Tenggara. People of haplogroup Q and P are non-Austronesian speakers. What\u2019s more interesting is Mentawai and Nias, the haplogroup of the people in those islands are grouped with the native people of Formosa, Austronesian speakers who travelled to the south around 5,000 years ago. Source: Tracing the origin of Indonesian people through genetics  What is wrong is discriminating humans based on race or ethnicities. There is nothing wrong in finding out our ancestries, and classifying humans based on genetics. The history of human migrations and its diverse mutations and adaptations is tied to our understanding of humans as a species. One other benefit is that from the data we can trace mutations or genetic based disease. By collecting and analysing the genetics data of Indonesians, we can fill the gap of data about human migration between the Asian mainland and the Pacific Islands. The genetics of Indonesian people are a mix between different groups of humans. Our genetics data shows that the Indonesian archipelago was once a centre of civilisation. Our research also has provided us with basic information about mutations of specific diseases such as the inherited blood disease thalasemia. Thalasemia is the main genetic disease in Indonesia.
