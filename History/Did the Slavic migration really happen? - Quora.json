            "answer_text": "Nope. You can repeat fairytales but you dont understand humanity and history. There were no Grand monolinguistic nations back then. Only warrior hierarchies rulled and moved freely around. And only men with weapons had mobility as they could not only carry food but also collect from nature or steal with force from peasanst. There is not one source that Explians how a population pyramid with 50% women,50% children under 10, and average life lof 30 can move trough rivers and mountains. 80% of those people could not even carry their weight in food. Large fast migration of poor families back then was impossible\u2026as is now.There were no educadion methods back then to explain how you assimilate into a foreign language a population pyramide with an avr. IQ of 100. Even today no area has over 60% bilingual rate (2nd language on basic conversation level, not native) The story about the all assimilating \u201cSlavic Nation\u201d was constructed in a time where people could NOT fact check. Now we can fact check but we love to reprat fake stories. I will leave this open to discussion. As some brains will have a hard time accepting my correction to general history. ",
