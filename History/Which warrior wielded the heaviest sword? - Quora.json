            "answer_text": "That would most likely be the Landsknecht, more specifically the Doppels\u00f6ldner ones wielding Zweih\u00e4nders.  Landsknecht were a type of mercenary in 15th- and 16th- century Europe. Doppels\u00f6ldner were literally \"double pay\"-men, either the volunteers who fought in the front rank of the formation for better wages or the  more experienced specialists. One subcategory of the Doppels\u00f6ldner were the ones wielding Zweih\u00e4nders, swords which could be up to 180cm (6ft) long and weigh 2-3.2kg (4.4-7.1 lb). These were used to guard the standard bearer of the unit, and according to some accounts also as the first rank of a pike unit in order to attack the spears or pikes of an enemy unit. I've heard this from multiple sources and having handled both types of weapons, it makes quite a bit of sense. There seems to be historical accounts of the story as well, but as they are of a later date than the actual use of the weapons, it cannot be verified. It can, however, be said for a fair degree of certainty that the Zweih\u00e4nder was a weapon meant primarily for unit warfare and a specific role rather than being the optimal tool for all your needs in personal combat.

His innovative military strategy is still in practise among Indian army regiments. ",
