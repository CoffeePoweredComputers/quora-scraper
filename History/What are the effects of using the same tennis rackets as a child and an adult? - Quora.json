            "answer_text": "A child\u2019s tennis racquet is made to fit a child. As a player progresses through their age their racquet should change and fit them appropriately. I\u2019m a 65 year old male and play with a brand new Prince. I chose the brand Prince because it is tennis elbow friendly. I used to play with the Wilson brand but found them too stiff and head heavy. Another great racquet brand is Head. I\u2019ve played using them. They are light weight and maneuver nicely at the baseline and at net. My wife uses a Prince Shark which is an old brand but she likes it because she says it still fits her playing needs and is head heavy, thus her return shots are more precise and faster returns that whip through the air like a missile. She has a Head racquet that she likes to play when she feels she needs a new \u201cstick\u201d for the opponent she is playing. My daughter uses Babolat. She played with a Wilson at the beginning and great results but found that she was developing tennis elbow. She switched to a Prince that offered her cushioning and improved her game and no elbow pain. When it came time to replace the Prince she test drove the Babolat. Using the Babolat AeroDrive racquet model her hitting improved and her shot making became precise and her returns became lethal for her opponent to return. Another factor that needs to be addressed when it comes to racquets is the weight of the racquet and the head. A heavier racquet may produce a missile return but you will compromise the effect it will have on your wrist and arm and swing motion. Usually a shorter swing will be required. However, with a light head racquet you\u2019re able to whip the return better becomes of the lack of weight. If the weight is too light for a player they can always install weight tape at the head of the racquet. Weight tape comes in different sizes for your individual needs. Also, strings and the tension you have the racquet strung at. Stringing a racquet at a lower tension will produce a trampoline effect and will result in less control. However, stringing it at a higher tension may result in a more powerful return. Most manufacturers of strings will have a recommended tension guide for you. You can also inquire with the racquet stringer at your pro shop for recommendations. We have our racquets strung according to the manufacturers recommendations and then we usually go one step up or down for our needs. Hope this will help you. Cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "LOL. For me, that would have been the end of my tennis career. I started in the day of the wood rackets. If I didn\u2019t make the transition, I would have quit. Like every athlete, you do have to evolve. Technology gets better, too. So, staying with what you used starting out as a kid probably won\u2019t help you evolve as an athlete in that sport. ",
