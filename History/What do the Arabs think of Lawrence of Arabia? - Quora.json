            "answer_text": "I truly despise him. He exploited the hospitality of the Arabs to his own advantage. He used to talk about them so bad (Sometimes he said good things, but not totally good either). I will give some examples of what he said : In a letter of July 1918 : \u201cthe Arab appealed to my imagination. It is the old, old civilisation, which has refined itself clear of the household gods, and half the trappings which ours hastens to assume. The gospel of bareness in materials is a good one, and it involves apparently a sort of moral bareness too.\u201d \u201cThey think for the moment, and endeavour to slip through life without turning corners or climbing hills. In part it is a mental and moral fatigue, a race trained out, and to avoid difficulties they have to jettison so much that we think honourable and grave.\u201d Yet in his 1921 introduction to Doughty\u2019s Arabia Deserta, Lawrence wrote of contemporary Arabs: \u201cThey are a limited narrow-minded people whose inert intellects lie incuriously fallow. Their imaginations are keen but not creative. There is so little Arab art to-day in Asia that they can nearly be said to have no art\u2026 . They show no longing for great industry, no organisations of mind or body anywhere. They invent no systems of philosophy or mythologies.\u201d In June 1911, while digging at Carchemish, he exclaimed: \u201cThe perfectly hopeless vulgarity of the half-Europeanised Arab is appalling. Better a thousand times the Arab untouched.\u201d Writing from Cairo the following year, he lamented that \u201cthe Egyptian people are horribly ugly, very dirty, dull, low-spirited, without any of the vigour or the self-confident independence of our [Carchemish] men. Besides, the [religious] fanaticism of the country is deplorable, and the treatment of the women most un European\u201d Also he said : \u201cArabs could be swung on an idea as on a cord; for the unpledged allegiance of their minds made them obedient servants\u2026 . They were incorrigibly children of the idea, feckless and colour-blind, to whom body and spirit were for ever and inevitably opposed. Their mind was strange and dark, full of depressions and exaltations, lacking in rule, but with more of ardour and more fertile of belief than any other in the world.\u201d He described Arabs as : \u201cone of the shallowest and least patient races of mankind\u201d Again : \u201cI was tired to death of these Arabs; petty incarnate Semites who attained heights and depths beyond our reach though not beyond our sight. They realized our absolute in their unrestrained capacity for good and evil.\u201d You can see that he was nearly a schizophrenic person; he had bipolar opinions about the same matters. When he talked about \u201cFeisal\u201d, an Arab leader from Mecca, he first described him as : \u201cvery tall and pillar-like \u2026 framed between the uprights of a black doorway\u2026 . His hands were crossed in front of him on his dagger.\u201d \u201cSherif Feisal (3rd Son of Sherif of Mecca), to whom I am attached, is about 31, tall, slight, lively, well-educated. He is charming towards me, and we get on perfectly together. He has a tremendous reputation in the Arab world as a leader of men, and a diplomat. His strong point is handling tribes: he has the manner that gets on perfectly with tribesmen, and they all love him. At present he is governing a patch of country about as large as Wales, and doing it efficiently.\u201d \u201chad in him something of the prophetic fire, and his eloquence, enthusiasm, and knowledge soon gave him a personal ascendancy over all the tribes in contact with him.\u201d But then he described him in a whole different way : \u201cFeisal was less than weak, he was empty, only a great pipe waiting for a wind\u201d \u201cFeisal, a timid man, hated running into danger, yet would do anything for Arab freedom\u2014his one passion, purely unselfish. Here, as later in Iraq, it made him face things and risks he hated. At original attack on Medina he had nerved himself to put on a bold front, and the effort had shaken him so that he never courted danger in battle again.\u201d Then when writing his book, he described him as : \u201ctall, graceful and vigorous, with the most beautiful gait, and a royal dignity of head and shoulders\u2026 . Appetite and physical weakness were mated in him, with the spur of courage. His personal charm, his imprudence, the pathetic hint of frailty as the sole reserve of this proud character made him the idol of his followers.\u201d Lawrence also praises Feisal as a judge and diplomat, and for his ability to attract and unite the tribal armies, which he raised for a particular campaign as he passed through their territory and then left behind as he advanced northward. By the time the heterogeneous tribes reached Damascus, only a few hundred Hejazis \u201ci.e. Saudis\u201d remained in the army, and they had in their ranks \u201chundreds of deadly enemies, their feuds barely suspended by Feisal\u2019s peace.\u201d In conclusion, i don\u2019t think he was/is worthy of any respect. He manipulated ignorant and naive people to reach his goals. Serving his own country, and ruining Arab countries. ",

            "answer_text": "I see him for what he was, a British military officer who had a keen interest in the Near East. He sympathized with the Arab cause but was rightly loyal to his country\u2019s interests, as any good military officer ought to be. I do not know why anyone expects him to help Arabs any more than he did. Why should he have? He isn\u2019t Arab, belonged to no Arab tribe or kingdom, and worked for the United Kingdom, his home country. He did his job and found time to support the Arabs, who knows exactly how things might\u2019ve turned out if it wasn\u2019t for his fairly minor intervention. For all we know, things might\u2019ve become even worse than they are today. I don\u2019t see him necessarily as some shining hero he may be portrayed as sometimes, but I also don\u2019t see him as someone villainous. He was just another officer of the United Kingdom, but I give him credit for being more humane and sympathetic than almost anyone else of his position would\u2019ve been. Critics of T.E. Lawrence don\u2019t give him enough credit for that. Would any other officer have been so understanding of the plight of our people? I doubt it. European military officers and diplomats had a rightful reputation of being cruel, dehumanizing to African and Asian subjects, and wildly supremacist. He had criticisms of the Arab world and Arab people, as displayed in other answers here, but what else would you expect someone of an empire who conquered half of the world to think? I doubt the Arabs of the early empires thought the Spanish Catholics were very civilized when they ruled over them for 700 years. The British were, at the time, the most technologically advanced and accomplished civilization on Earth, what else would they think about people still in tribes, nomads, etc. who had fell out of urban city life centuries ago? People have to remember how different the world was in earlier centuries. It wasn\u2019t globalized and you weren\u2019t expected to not be racist. It\u2019s a silly assumption. ",
