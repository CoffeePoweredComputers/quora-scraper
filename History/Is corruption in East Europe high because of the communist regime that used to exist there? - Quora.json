This is a classic environment for corruption to flourish. As a teenager I had a difficulty passing the driving test. I failed three times. Then somebody who worked in a taxicab company said he can arrange for it. He needed a meal for two in an expensive restaurant and a bottle of cognac. On the next day I was ahead of the line to take the test again; I barely started the engine and I passed. However, in the Soviet Union corruption was abated by fear. People knew that someone, somewhere might denounce their corrupt activities; they may lose their job or even go to jail. Corrupt behaviors usually were between trusted people, between friends. Once the Soviet Union collapsed, the fear was gone. In fact, the call to rapid transition to the free market was understood as simply a call for everyone to exercise his corrupt connections. So, the privatization became a way for various managers, directors, administrators, and, chiefly, various government services from KGB down \u2014 to loot whatever remained of the Soviet economy. Now the stakes were much higher: whole factories were acquired through corrupt means. The Soviet mentality in a legal anarchy that was 1990\u2019s was a horrible thing, and while Putin put some brake on most egregious excesses, the mentality has not disappeared, and neither did corruption.

Then the change to market economy came in a quite abrupt manner and caught everyone unprepared. Those countries had to transit in a few years what took about 200 years for the main capitalist economies. They are still learning how things are supposed to really work. ",
