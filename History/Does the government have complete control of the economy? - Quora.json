            "answer_text": "Complete control of anything is almost impossible. Now, depending on the Country and situation, there are completely different levels of control possible, even within the confines of what seems to be very similar political systems. For example, the United States, occupying a hegemonic role not just in the Americas but in the Global Economy, controlling the flow of money by enforcing their own currency being the staple of global banking and securing it is used exclusively for transacting certain hard goods (let's say, Oil for example) while being able to control its own money supply through the Federal Reserve, certainly has a lot of influence into the Market. Not enough to completely stop looming catastrophes - like the 2008 collapse of the Markets - but certainly way more than countries that don\u2019t have that kind of control. And this is why a total failure of proper planning and regulation - like that what lead up to 2008 - can be patched up and pushed down the road in case of the US, while smaller hurdles in economies that are not as much in control of their currency and/or credit (e.g. Greece), or are not able to use the global banking system and effectively being locked out of the Global Economy (e.g. Venezuela), lead to catastrophes. This level of control some Governments have is not scalable: the US is in a unique position Globally, just like Germany and to a lesser extent France is in a unique position within the EU. China is a unique power in the East and so is India: the latter two only recently found ways to break free and start re-writing the rules the Colonialists have imposed on them. Extrapolating their results and expecting smaller countries/economies etc with no \u201csay\u201d to rig the rules in their favor to have the same results, is fallacious. ",

            "answer_text": "No. At its best, the government\u2019s benign neglect results in economic growth at a modest level. At its worst, any attempt to \u201cspur the economy\u201d or \u201creturn to the days of 4% GDP growth in the US\u201d backfires and makes things worse rather than better. People are familiar with the credo doctors adopt, \u201cFirst do no harm,\u201d but are largely unfamiliar with the other \u201cBetter is the enemy of good.\u201d Equally true of economies. Or to put this more succinctly while Presidents can rarely improve things much, they can certainly screw things up by trying to. ",
