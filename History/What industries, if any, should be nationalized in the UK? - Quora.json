            "answer_text": "I am assuming that the question refers to industries that are not currently nationalised. I am not doctrinaire about this; any industry where public ownership can deliver better on various social goals should be nationalised. Whether this criterion is met for a given industry is a complex empirical question that I am not qualified to answer.  However, with that said, I would like to see the trains nationalised and (more heavily) subsidised. Here is an example. I recently had a university reunion, and I decided to drive the approx 140 miles each way. Now, there are a few intrinsic advantages to driving that will never realistically be addressed by rail, including: Easier to carry stuff. I had a rucksack and a tux, so not a lot of stuff, but even then it is easier to hang your suit/tux up in your carCan be flexible about leaving time, within reason.Don't have to go outside in bad weatherCan listen to radio loudly without annoying anyone.Don't have to deal with annoying people on trains. Even in the Quiet Carriage, there's always some numpty. In the normal carriages, there's always a loud idiot. Driving is fun so long as traffic is not horrendous and you stay away from the very largest cities. So, there are intrinsic advantages to driving. But on top of that, it is cheaper! I spent \u00a325 on petrol, \u00a310 on the M6 toll (could have avoided that, but it's worth it to avoid Birmingham), \u00a33 parking when I got there. I drive a small, fuel efficient car so let's round up to \u00a345 total to allow for inefficient driving or a bigger engine.  If I was to do that same journey tomorrow by train (so advance booking by one day, off peak return) a quick look on National Rail Enquiries says this would cost me \u00a394! Even if I set the journey to two weeks on the future, it's still \u00a394. This isn't travelling at rush hour, it's a 12.30 departure outward and a 14.30 departure return. This is a total joke. It was economically rational for me to drive as a single-occupier in a car, and spew out all sorts of pollutants. I wasn't travelling not the arse end of nowhere either, it was from Cheshire to a major university city.  If we are serious about tackling congestion, climate change etc, then it needs to be made economically rational to take public transport outside of London. And not just if you book a million years in advance. This means that either driving needs to become much more expensive/inconvenient or public transport needs to become cheaper. Would renationalising the trains and more heavily subsidising them work? I don't know, but the situation, as a non-Londoner, can't get much worse. Though I guess this is more about transport policy in the round than nationalisation per se.  ",

            "answer_text": "Easy! Anything which is an essential asset of the nation, which is essentially all of us. That would mean rail, energy, water, central banking, and vital industry, notably steel and resources - forests, woodlands, some minerals. However, there is no reason why the government couldn\u2019t run publicly owned companies in these sectors alongside private ones - this has happened recently with rail - and very successfully. The political trend is towards localised public ownership with managements comprised of users, experts and workers, rather than the huge, unaccountable, state entities of yesteryear. For anyone who has doubts, consider three things: First, chunks of the above sectors are already being run by the state, but the state in question is France, Germany or China. Second, why do we never talk about privatising one of the biggest state sectors - the military? third, there is a maxim, if you don\u2019t own it, you can\u2019t control it and nationalisation is about whether we or private entities should exploit something we all depend upon.
