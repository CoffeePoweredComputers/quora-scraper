It should be on the north part of that country called Austria-Hungary, but it\u2019s not. That\u2019s because Czechoslovakia was not an independent entity at the time. The land where ethnic Czechs and Slovaks inhabited was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Czechoslovakia declared independence from Austria-Hungary in October 1918 following the defeat of the Central Powers (in which Austria-Hungary was a member) in the First World War. In short, there was no independent state called Czechoslovakia in the year 1900. ",

            "answer_text": "Czechoslovakia was established in late 1918 after Austria-Hungary dissolved when it lost the World War I. The idea of Czechoslovakia was actually extremely recent at that time. Only since the Bolshevik Coup in Russia in 1917, some people began to use the term \u201cCzecho-Slovak Republic\u201d, first with the hyphenation. Even within Austria-Hungary, the union of Czechia and Slovakia was in no way \u201chighlighted\u201d. They belonged to the different halves of the monarchy. Czechia belonged to the Western part just like Austria proper while Slovakia was a part of the Kingdom of Hungary, the main part of the Eastern part of the dual monarchy. The World War I strengthened the ethnic perspective on the territory of Europe. Czechia and Slovakia had majority populations speaking Slavic languages, and closely related ones, which is why it made sense to coin the idea of the new Czechoslovak nation. Whether the idea of the Czechoslovak nation was artificial or sustainable is debatable. We know that it wasn\u2019t sustained. Aside from Czechia and Slovakia, Czechoslovakia also covered the Subcarpathian Rus. That poor region remained a \u201cspecial province\u201d throughout the First Republic. After the Second World War, a referendum decided that they wanted to unify with the USSR, its Ukranian sub-republic, and is therefore the Zakarpathian Region of sovereign Ukraine today. The people over there have been sorry about their post-war decision many times, the life would surely be better from most respects if they had belonged to Czechoslovakia. ",
