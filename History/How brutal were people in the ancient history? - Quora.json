            "answer_text": "Times were very harsh and cruel back then. They didn\u2019t have the technology or wealth that we have now. Back then it was basically just sticking close to your tribe, working and fighting against enemy tribes. There was also superstition everywhere and almost everyone feared some sort of eternal damnation or wrath from god(s). The people were basically born into a body that was stuck in between a rock and a hard place. Not only were they born into a harsh environment where the threat of death/injury was a routine occurrence, but they also lived under the threat of eternal hellfire in the after life. There was no escape for them, not even death could save them from the cruelty of their predicament. The harsh environment reflects those who live in it and so ancient people were harsh and cruel as well, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have survived. It was survival of the fittest. There was no universal human rights recognition because killing and brutality was often a means of surviving. If an enemy tribe invaded your land, you\u2019d have to fight them as brutally as they fight you otherwise they would win. There was no governing body (like the UN or international law) that could mediate between two warring tribes. Any sort of weakness or kindness would be exploited by others. Ruling regimes were like mafias, they had to demonstrate power and fear otherwise someone who was even more brutal would come take their throne. Brutality/intimidation was a way of maintaining power, otherwise enemy tribes/rivals would exploit your kindness and use it against you. Your people had to respect you otherwise they wouldn\u2019t follow you. Human rights, the UN, medical advancement, etc was all something that we could afford once we developed powerful technology and acquired a lot of wealth from industrialization. Back then, surviving was the only thing on their mind and so their society was more primitive and backwards compared to ours as a result. ",

            "answer_text": "To understand ancient peoples mentality, you must understand some fact. To survive, you need food. To ensure your children survival you must have enough fertile land and safety. Safety means larger numbers in your tribe, which needs more children, which needs more fertile women. You can count only to your relatives. This means your tribe. Any other people are rival, who want to steal your land, your cattle, your women. to ensure the safety of your lineage, you must exterminate all nearby non-relative man. So you must hit them as hard as you can, because otherwise they have no mercy for you and your children. The result? The ancient people were quite caring toward their tribemates, their relatives, but very cruel toward others, especially after settling. Killing the whole bloodline (from newborn to elders) except fertile women ensure safety of your tribe and prevent wengeful retaliations. Sometimes young males were also allowed to live if the tribe was in short of young warriors or workforce (in this case castration were working practice to prevent riot and fouling of bloodline) and customs allowed their integration. If you must choose between yours and theirs, a man always choose the life of his own blood. EDIT: In Papua-Guinea even in near past there was common, if two man unknown to each other met, they began to recall their relatives, trying to find a common one. Because if they are not relatives, they will try to kill each other. ",
