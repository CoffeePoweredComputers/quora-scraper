            "answer_text": "Governments can help drive the economics of a country. Increased government spending or decreased can effect the economics of a country. Example under the hoover administration almost everything they did made i worse, they slashed government spending, increased lending rate and tightened credit. the government has to regulate capitalism or it just becomes one group gets wealthy and everyone else gets poor. You need the government to set a bottom threw welfare and unemployment benefits. Without a bottom the whole thing can collapse. ",

            "answer_text": "Because most government politicians and workers either have never read Adam Smith\u2019s The Wealth of Nations (1776 book), or don\u2019t believe it. Or realize that it negates their political or power objectives so they pretend it just isn\u2019t true. They mistakenly believe that the government drives the creation of wealth, rather than individuals each working to get rewarded by providing useful products and services for others. ",
