            "answer_text": "There were many differences between fighters of the Great War and World War II, and many of these differences explain why combat parachutes were impractical for, say, a Sopwith Camel or a Folder DR-1 as opposed to a Hurricane, Focke-Wulfe, or P-51 just 3 decades later. First, weight. A 150 lbs. first generation parachute conferred a significant weight penalty on the lightweight WW1 machines. Better to add another gun or a bit of armor plate than a parachute. Heavier airplanes climb slower and do not turn as tightly. Second, seat and head brace armor plate in later WW2 designs meant that a pilot, when attacked from behind, stood a good chance of sustaining only non-debilitating injuries even as his airframe and engine were destroyed around him. In such a case, a pilot might be able to exit his airplane out into the slipstream. World War 1 pilots, when shot from behind had a high probability of taking multiple .30/8mm caliber bullets into their own bodies rendering them unable to get out. Too many appendages as well as their torsos would be shot up. In this case, getting out of an airplane is just too difficult. Yes, yes, I know a clever pilot can release his seat belt, jettison the canopy (in WW2 designs), and push forward on the stick and you'll eject yourself from the airplane. Except this is far more difficult in real life than Microsoft Flight Sim would have you believe. Your egress will be \u201cungraceful\u201d: you might leave body parts behind, like your leg or ankle, or your shoulder. And it's also why everyone started work on ejection seats by the end of the second world war. Third, World War 1 fighters, in addition to having no armor plate for the pilot also put the fuel tank right in front of the pilot, right behind the engine (in the most common tractor engine/propeller design). What this meant is that an unfortunate pilot gunned from behind not only sustained several rifle caliber hits, but it was highly likely those rounds and a few near miss rounds continued forward to puncture, perhaps fully rip open, the fuel tank above his knees. The fuel would spray back into the injured fighter pilot's face and quickly saturate his cockpit and clothing \u2026 AND THEN IT WOULD IGNITE. The engine exhausts were short, open, and spewing sparks and flame. World War 1 fighter pilots most often died from a combination of bullet wounds and immolation. That Webley .38 revolver the RAF pilots carried? It wasn't to fight off German capture teams if the pilot made it safely onto the ground; more likely, it was to cut short the awful agony of slowly burning to death starting with your face and hands, bleeding out of arm and leg and body wounds that prevent you from getting out of the airplane (let alone, lugging out a heavy, awkward parapack that may or may not be sliced up itself by rifle caliber bullets), as you slowly, almost leisurely tumble/spin at a 1000 feet per minute descent from 10,000 feet altitude. Awful. Just bloody awful. By World War II everything is changed. Fuel was mostly carried in the wings so blowtorch intense fires back into your face were less likely. Between the wars aeronautical engineers adopted the notion of a steel firewall between the engine and cockpit to prevent an engine fire from flowing back and impinging (such a nice word, impinging) on the pilot. (My private little airplane, a Cessna 172, has a steel firewall today.) Cockpit seat backs were mostly armored. This wouldn't stop all bullets and shells, but oftentimes, enough. Parapacks became lighter, smaller, more reliable, and generally more practical all around. Add to the technical improvements a tremendous increase in training, including emergency inflight egress, and you have a pretty good understanding why parachutes were a thing in 1942, and except for escaping from manned, tethered (artillery) observation balloons, not a thing in 1916. I doubt the generals ever gave the order to not carry parachutes. That sounds like a field grade rumor from men who faced death by bullets and fire every day, and whose life expectancy was only a few weeks. ",

            "answer_text": "No. The real reason parachutes were typically not issued to pilots, on both sides of the conflict, is that your chances of survival with a parachute were extremely small. Think about it. You jump out of your plane, and then what? The fall alone would probably kill you. Even in World War II your chances of coming back from a combat flying mission over occupied Europe were about 50/50. (In the Pacific your odds were better, since  by the time the Americans started bombing Japan on a regular basis the Japanese Air Force had pretty much been decimated.) Also, imagine how much room a parachute takes up in a World War I plane. That extra room is best used for fuel. ",
