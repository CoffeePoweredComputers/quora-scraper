            "answer_text": "Alexander married two women Stateira II and Parysatis II who were both Persian. Stateira II was a daughter of Darius III and was taken captive by Alexander after he had defeated Darius III in November 333 at the Battle of Issus. Darius tried to ransom his daughter even offering her hand to Alexander in exchange for releasing his family and ending the war, but Alexander wouldn\u2019t bite. He had already decided he wanted to marry her and did not need Darius for that. Stateira became Alexander's second wife in 324 BC, almost ten years after her capture, in a mass ceremony known as The Susa weddings. Source: Stateira II - Wikipedia During this same ceremony Alexander married again! This time to Parysatis, who was the daughter of the previous Persian ruler Artaxerxes III. It was a fairly common custom to marry the children of the rulers that you defeated. All of this marrying was done to cement his ties to both branches of the royal family of the Achaemenid Empire. Which was a vast empire with a lot of influence giving Alexander another weapon to his already loaded arsenal. The fate of the Persian wives after Alexander died was not that great, they were killed by Roxanne as to cement her own position and that of her son, unborn at that time, by ridding herself of a rival who could be - or claim to be - pregnant.

Due to large distances macedonia could not rule and maintain order in far away kingdoms like persia and so alexander married the local princesses in a lot of theseplaces to establish bonds and have a familial relation that would legitimise their heirs as both greek and persian.
