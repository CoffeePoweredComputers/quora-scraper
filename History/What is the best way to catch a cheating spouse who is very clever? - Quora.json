            "answer_text": "While there may be a lot of ways to catch someone who is cheating on you, stop first and ask yourself does it really matter that you have proof? Something is wrong. The partner is distant, money is disappearing, you think you\u2019re being lied to. Okay, even if the other person is not physically cheating on you, something is going really really wrong in this relationship. You have to ask yourself what if it\u2019s true what would I do? So before you do anything else, talk to a lawyer. Is your state a true no fault state? Every state now has a no fault option.If your state also allows fault divorces, does finding fault change settlements or custody?Is your state a community property state?This advice is for both sexes. Run a credit report. Make sure you have copies of social security numbers for both spouses and the kids and run credit reports on all of them. (Yes, run a credit report on your child. I know one scumbag who opened accounts in the kids\u2019 names.) This is not to prove or disprove anything - this is to protect yourself and your kids if something does suddenly go terribly wrong. If you live in a true no fault state, you don\u2019t need proof to get a divorce. If you don\u2019t then talk to the lawyer about how to move forward. A marriage is always two things (although we often forget it when we\u2019re happy). It\u2019s a commitment to love and honor another person but it\u2019s also a legal arrangement between people who jointly hold property. Cheating hits us on the love & honor side but the side you need to keep your eye on is the legal side. Even more than the love and honor side. That\u2019s why if this is about a boyfriend or girlfriend btw, I think the answer is much easier. Don\u2019t worry about catching them. Just move out or have them move out while you work on the relationship. Once they\u2019re out, other people will tell you about the cheating. If this is about a spouse, once you know what legally can happen, you have to make decisions. Whether or not they\u2019re actually cheating, something is wrong. Depending on what the lawyer advised, don\u2019t bring up your suspicions. You have legitimate causes of complaint, you two need counseling. IF you find anything like money being siphoned off or assets suddenly going missing? You are already being divorced - the spouse just \u2018forgot\u2019 to tell you. Freeze the credit lines and make sure any investments have both names on it. (Talk to the lawyer). Rather than putting yourself through \u201ccatching the cheater\u201d IF it\u2019s not going to improve your situation one bit, I wouldn\u2019t waste the energy. I\u2019d go into counselling if I wanted to save the marriage or I\u2019d ask them to move out if I decided it wasn\u2019t worth it. Because whether there\u2019s cheating or not, you have real problems that are going to make this a miserable situation for you. If they say to you \u201cBaby, I love you. Of course, I\u2019m not cheating on you. How could you believe such a terrible thing? Is it your friends, your mother - you know they always hated me.\u201d You are now arguing about cheating. You are not talking about feelings of abandonment, of coldness and distance, of emotional withdrawal. The feelings are what you want to deal with - because you don\u2019t need to spend time and money to prove that you\u2019re feeling abandoned and emotionally betrayed. Bill Clinton is not the only man btw to define sex as strictly missionary and nothing else. I knew a guy with a girlfriend and both of them assured me it wasn\u2019t cheating since they never slept together. Right. He snuck out to see her, they went to dinner and movies, he would talk to her for hours about how cold and withdrawn his wife was and he put romantic little messages in the classifieds for Valentine\u2019s Day - but it\u2019s not cheating because there was no sex. (Religious nutcases frankly). Don\u2019t bother looking for the adultery unless the lawyer says to. Fix the communication problems or throw them out. ",

            "answer_text": "No one suggested this yet but here goes, and only if you are very sure that the cheating is happening: Set up a hidden video camera so the cheater\u2019s face will show, find out what P.I. report envelopes usually look like, create one and fill it with nonsense and tickets to an event he likes. Seel it tight. Maybe get a good clear lock box containing that said envelope and place it on the table. Hide the key. Sat the cheater on chosen chair, confront the cheater and say calmly that it\u2019s over, you hired a P.I and you know everything and the evidence is in that envelope. Here comes the reaction. There may be many different ones, but the tickets to an actual event are an escape for you, with your acting skills. If he gets mad or extremely nervous or weasel-like, or overly loving or overly hurt or obsessively interested what is inside the envelope, then it\u2019s a sure thing: you\u2019ve caught a cheater. Do not give away the envelope and do not tell about a camera. If he shows the opposite reaction and is calm and laughs and says something like \u2018you have got be joking\u2019 then there may be a small chance you have been paranoid. Laugh with all your heart and run to the camera and say something like it being the prank of the year, let him open the box and envelope: tickets, yay! Tell that you have been watching pranking videos lately and wanted to try it out. Now.. here comes the camera again. Now you can watch his reactions again, even in slow motion. There are many things even good liars do that they are not aware of. I am sure Quora has plenty of questions answered about that topic. Do your research. Take into consideration cheater\u2019s normal mannerisms, or does one have anxiety disorder. If someone is a born con-artist and you don\u2019t see much signs of lying then you have 2 choices; wait for him to screw up later or hire an actual P.I. Take into consideration these things: your past relationships, your childhood. People with broken childhoods have trust issues and seek for the only familiar thing: broken. Unknowingly they repeat a destructive pattern because it\u2019s the only thing that feels like home. For example; kids with narcissistic parent often seek one themselves as adults. If you haven\u2019t build up your life and grown out of that pattern ie done the emotional work then there is a chance that you have found your destructive parental figure all over again, because those who want to deceive will seek for those who are broken and easily misled. It gives them the feeling of power. Which is what repeated, deceptive cheating is all about. Most of these kind of cheaters are narcissists and most of them aren\u2019t any more clever than others: narcissism is all about insecurity, and they have learned to hide it under a facade. They have learned to represent them as either succesful, charming, witty or as bitter victims who are never understood by anyone. Very few are actually clever and almost everybody will crumble and fall in their web of lies. Think of your earlier relationships: was there cheating/lying/abuse? If yes then you may be repeating a pattern subconciously and that is more evidence. Did your relationship start suddenly and shortly after the previous ended? More evidence. Are you submissive and give in more often than others? Evidence. If their behaviour changes dramatically after the prank then that\u2019s more evidence. Just walk out or hire a P.I. P.I., confession or you spying is the only way to get to 100% certainty. But oftentimes we may need to get to only 80\u201390 to make a decision to stay or to walk out. Beware; narcissists and psychopaths are experts in manipulation: many have stayed after spouse getting caught cheating JUST because of masterful manipulation. No one is immune! If I said accidentally he or him anywhere then that was a mistake coming from a fact me being a woman and therefore imagining this scenario happening to myself while writing. I have been cheated on, never cheated anyone myself and most men are loyal and kind. But those who haven\u2019t, traumatize you and makes you mistrustful of everyone. Therefore you need to look at all the aspects and whether your feeling is an instinct, or fear from previous trauma. I managed to break my pattern but trauma doesn\u2019t leave you; it can only reform. If your suspicious behaviour is from trauma then it can be worked out by being open and honest with your spouse. So, if they are not cheating after all, it can be saved by being open and honest. Many relationships have been unnecessarily destroyed by other one spying on the other, in those cases the suspicion came from trauma but because it was not discussed in time, it was too late. The spying one was the one being deceptive. I would be hurt if the other one was spying on me to such extreme lengths, because I am faithful to the fullest extent, and therefore not giving away any signs. That\u2019s why you need to think percentage-wise in case of misunderstandings. A brother\u2019s sock can really be a brother\u2019s sock! And that one hair can be from anyone, don\u2019t you know how far hair can fly and as someone who owns hairy pets; I spread them everywhere I go: into my brother\u2019s piano chair, hotels, airplanes, pilates class you name it. So why not human hair. I once got paranoid about a hair but it turned out to be my boyfriend\u2019s. I forgot how long and beautiful his hair has grown into. LOL. So, you have to have plenty of evidence before even attempting the prank or spying. Listen to your gut feeling and ask if you are willing to lose the relationship. If you are at least 80% sure the other one is cheating and have prepared to lose the other one either by wrongful accusation ie showing that you don\u2019t trust the other or by finding out the ugly truth, then you should do it.
