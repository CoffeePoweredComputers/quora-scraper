So he could definitely serve as Biden\u2019s running mate. Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama would all be ineligible, as they have served two terms already. You can\u2019t be VP if you can\u2019t be President. Biden-Carter would be some ticket. It would make Biden seem young, so there is some strategy for choosing Jimmy. ",
