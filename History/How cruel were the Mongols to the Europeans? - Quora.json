            "answer_text": "The \"great Mongol invasion\" comprised a force of about 200,000 fighters Hungary - At least 20%-40% of the population died. The Hungarian army (some 60,000 on the eve of the Battle of Muhi) was destroyed. The king escaped with the help of his bodyguard, but the rest of the army was either killed without mercy by the Mongols or drowned in the rivers while attempting an escape. The Mongols attacked Hungary with three armies. One of them attacked through Poland in order to withhold possible Polish auxiliaries and defeated the army of Duke Henry II the Pious of Silesia at the Legnica. Duke Henry was slain (after trying to retreat) and \"nine sacks of ears\" collected by the victors \"attested to the heavy losses of the defeated.\" Transylvania A southern army attacked Transylvania, defeated the Voivode (military commander) and crushed the Transylvanian Hungarian army. The main army led by Khan Batu and Subutai attacked Hungary through the fortified Verecke Pass and annihilated the army led by the count Palatine on March 12, 1241. Oradea. The Mongols used to get into churches, men and women, and after abusing them in the lowest way, they killed them all in the same place. After they had all been destroyed, and, after the dead, being hot, began to rot, emitting an unbearable odor, the Mongols began to retreat from here leaving the place deserted. After they left, the people who were hiding in the nearby forests came out hungry, then the Mongols who chased them from the hiding places killed them, doing so every day until they had no one to kill and then they completely withdrawn. \u201d The Mongols often wandered through the thickets of the mares looking for a survivor everywhere, just as hunting dogs searched for rabbits or wild boars. \" Coming in the summer and the harvest time, the Mongols, realizing that their food is at an end, decided to use another stratagem to remove the population from the forest. Rogerius also wrote: \"After catching some of them hiding in the woods, he let them go, telling them that anyone who will submit to them, will be given the freedom to return home. People believed these words of theirs because they were starving for food. Thus, all who remained in their lives returned to their homes. After this was done, because it was the time of the harvest, they all gathered the harvest and put it in the barn together with straw and hay. Along with us were the Mongols and the Cumans. Many were watching and rejoicing because as parents they could buy their lives through their daughters, men through their wives, brothers through their beautiful sisters, giving them as a reward to the Mongols for dishonesty. During this time I saw that loaded with prey, herds, cattle and other things. Asked where all this came from, I was told that one night the Mongols surrounded more villages and soaked their swords in the blood of those killed and procured for them what I saw. Very few people escaped life by hiding, so the whole region became deserted. \u201d These aspects regarding the cruelty of the Mongols in the areas occupied by them and presented by the chroniclers of the time were also confirmed by King Ladislau IV \"Cumanul\" (1262-1290) (1272-1290) in 1279. Alba Iulia. Rogerius arrives on his way to the forest after eight days of walking through forests, and he arrives in Alba Iulia, which he describes as follows: \"At Alba Iulia we found nothing but the bones and the heads of those killed, as well as the ruined and scattered walls of the churches. and of the palaces, which the blood of the Christians had sprinkled, and though the earth thirsty for innocent blood, so that they could not be seen, yet over the stones still sprinkled with red blood, it was impossible for us to pass. , without painful groans and sighs. \" After the conquest and devastation of Cenad Fortress, the armies of the two will make their way to Arad, where they were to join the armies of Generals Kadan and Buri. The attack on Arad started with a cruel cruelty especially on the prisoners. In order not to endanger their own soldiers, the Mongols used at the siege of the Arad fortress Hungarian, Romanian, Cumani prisoners, Ruthenians whom they were forced to participate in the assault in the first place, being pushed from behind. They were soon killed by the defenders of the city as a whole. The siege lasted for a week day and night until the city's defense ditches were filled with corpses, then used as a bridge to the city walls. Mongols with a generalized attack manage to conquer the fortress. An eyewitness to this event wrote: \"The inhabitants and the defenders of the fortress inside it, the Mongols divided them into three categories: soldiers, women and peasants. They all pulled out of the field. They disarmed the soldiers, stripped them of their clothes, and stripped them of all their personal belongings, killing them with swords and swords. Among the women, each Mongolian chose two young girls as maidens and killed the others. He took the peasants to another place and, after stripping them, they killed them one by one. \" The entire Mongol campaign in Transylvania lasted for almost two and a half months (February 13 - April 30, 1241) a period of time when the Mongol forces destroyed, plundered and killed everything that came their way, proving an unprecedented ferocity. - over time.

            "answer_text": "Of course all conquerors were by definition cruel. In addition military historians generally think that until very modern times that all invading and occupying armies involved mass rape, torture, and murder in addition to theft. So very cruel. If you mean \u201chow were they different\u201d we have to depend on various reports of the conquered over time, and historical records do show different reactions to different invasions. Probably what makes Mongols rare in the invading army department is their announced policy of killing whole cities if they resisted. Genocides of course are sadly not unique in military history but they did not always occur so it puts Mongol policy in a rare group. Caesar, e.g., committed genocide in France. Comparing numbers of people enslaved, raped, murdered and the like is quite difficult since historical records summarizing battles are notorious for exaggeration. Europeans and Muslims alike did recoil at Mongol policy so perhaps Mongols should be lumped into the worst invaders like Caesar. But Mongols did not treat Europeans differently than others. The \u201ckill all resisting cities\u201d concept was not the common warfare method in the West, where over time in some places having soldiers go fight it out and then go home was a cultural practice for some armies, i.e. killing entire cities often defeated the point of warfare, which was often to capture gold or get the labor of peasants rather than to kill them. Destruction under the Mongol Empire - Wikipedia has a discussion suggesting mass slaughter on a larger-than-normal scale. ",
