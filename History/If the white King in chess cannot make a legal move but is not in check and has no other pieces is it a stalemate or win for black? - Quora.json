            "answer_text": "It depends. Stalemate conditions: 1: It must be your turn to move. 2: You are not in check. 3. You have no legal moves that you can make (and you must not put yourself in check). Instances where the question asked would not be stalemate: 1: You don\u2019t have a legal move but it\u2019s also not your turn to move. Once your opponent moves it\u2019s possible that the position will change and then you\u2019re no longer in stalemate. 2: You aren\u2019t defining pawns as pieces for some reason. If you can move a lawn, there\u2019s no stalemate. 3. You don\u2019t have any legal moves and just have a king. But it\u2019s their turn to move. They run out of time \u231b\ufe0f. They lose. ",

            "answer_text": "That would be stalemate, which is counted as a draw. Sometimes, stalemate can feel almost like a win for white, e.g. if black actually had ways to win yet stumbled into a stalemate trap. Or it might feel more like a win for black if white was winning (white would need to have other pieces in this case). Both cases are possible, but either way, it\u2019s a draw. ",
