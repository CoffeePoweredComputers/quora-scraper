            "answer_text": "I believe this is a natural tendency of us human beings. Our feelings or emotions are like our guiding compass. When I feel pain in my body this is signal that something might be wrong within. We use our feelings to express love and care for others. These are all positive expressions of our feelings. Now, when someone begins to get overly concerned about how others feel towards them could be a sign that they might lack self-esteem and need that constant external assurance. ",

            "answer_text": "They don't want to upset them or cause a confrontation. Some people care too much and it can hurt them because they worry about it a lot and are even scared of using tact and diplomacy and that's when people take the mickey. On the other hand,some people just don't care and that is just as bad because that can cause upset and confrontation. If tact and diplomacy don't work when handling a situation where honesty is needed,is not your fault. You are not responsible for the way a person thinks, feels and behaves, unless you are nasty about it. ",
