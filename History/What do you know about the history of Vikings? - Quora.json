            "answer_text": "A recent study by Nature was a wide-ranging recent project, the scope of which was to find out more about Viking ancestry by analysing the remains of presumed Vikings from various sites across Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, Greenland and various other parts of Europe, including Saaremaa, an island off Estonia. Key sites were also Gottland and Oland, as well as the Orkneys.  In effect, the results bore out historical opinion that the Norwegian and Danish Vikings went westwards on their travels to what is now known as the UK, Ireland and Greenland, whilst the Swedish Vikings generally headed east to what is now known as Russia and the Ukraine. In comparing the genomes of the ancient presumed Viking individuals, the researchers found a reasonably good match to present day Scandinavian populations. For example, using a random modern-day Danish population, there was quite a high correlation with the Danes today. The Swedish-origin Vikings surprisingly only matched no more than 15% - 30% of current day Swedes, the majority of Swedes today having more in common with Danish DNA.  The researchers grouped the Viking DNA into \u2018North Atlantic-like\u2019 clusters, \u2018Danish-like\u2019 clusters, \u2018Swedish-like\u2019 clusters and \u2018Norwegian-like\u2019 clusters. Interestingly, the researchers discovered that there was an element of ancient Finnish DNA amongst the Swedish Vikings. I am not sure if by this they mean Saami or Finnish ethnic. However, mtDNA is fairly similar between the two groups. However, from the chart above, we can see there remains a high element of Viking ancestry in Estonia, Finland, Latvia that seems to be more marked than Sweden. Norwegian-like DNA corresponds well with that of Ireland and the Scottish islands. Historian beliefs are confirmed in that Danish-like Vikings have left their mark in South East England especially. The Danes, of course, brought Danelaw to the area, which then was made up of various Anglo-Saxon tribes in the heart of England, Picts in Scotland and early Britons in Wales. An interesting finding was the discovery of two Vikings buried in Scotland actually had Pict DNA and were not Scandinavian at all! They are presumed Vikings because they were found buried with Viking artefacts, swords and shields. The Viking Sphere of Influence  So, the genetic findings pretty much match what the historians have surmised about the Vikings. Shock Finding A surprise finding in comparing the Viking individuals with modern day Danes was that the only trait in which there was a curve-ball - little correlation - was the trait for black hair. This had led the researchers to believe that - together with the non-Scandinavian and mixed DNA individuals - some Vikings actually came from Southern Europe and perhaps even Asia. The continent Europe is artificial as it is not actually a continent but part of the huge landmass continent that is called Eurasia and with no borders or even countries, I dare say people migrated freely. It again confirms that \u2018Viking\u2019 is not an ethnicity, although there is a correlation with northern European genes, but a \u2018profession\u2019, rather like a mercenary. A raider, pirate or trader.  Source: Nature Old Norse DNA It is claimed by some that the extremely rare Old Norse DNA relates to Haplogroup I and X. I have analysed the DNA results and of the 422 or so Viking individuals in the study, only 25 had these two haplotypes. Estimated Origin of mtDNA I and X  So, that broadens our knowledge of ancient Viking individuals. ",

            "answer_text": "That there us very little history known about the vikings. \u2022 They settled Greenland, Iceland, and Newfoundland. \u2022 They did not have horns on their helmets \u2022 They didn't eat 12 whole cheese rolls in the middle of battle. \u2022 They can't defeat pirates \u2022 They rarely had swords and they didn't carry battle axes. They usually carried tree axes and speara. tomahawks were a sub-common weapon. Their sheilds weren't metal or have iron bolts, they were small trees placed togethor held by a metal ring. \u2022They didn't invade and settle down, they raised and pillaged then ran away. \u2022 They have bloodlines that run all the way from North America to the middle east. Viking people made their way from Scandinavia all the way down through Turkey. \u2022my heritage is slightly scandinavian. ",
