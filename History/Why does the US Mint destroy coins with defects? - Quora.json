            "answer_text": "The US mint, like every mint, takes pride in it's products so defective coins, if discovered, are destroyed. Defective coins have been and continue to be bad for business. Nowadays, it is not good for the minting business to be making defective coins that will not circulate, as this forces the mint to produce even more coins to make up for those that have been pulled from circulation by error coin collectors. Defective coins can often be mistaken for counterfeits, causing a loss of confidence in the viability of the coin of the realm. In the days of coins being struck of precious metals, defective coins could have looked like they had been clipped or could be underweight, which would result in the coins being rejected by merchants.  Like the US Mint, the Royal Canadian Mint (RCM) competes with other mints around the world for the honour of striking coins for other countries that for various reasons choose not to operate their own mint or do not have the capacity to produce coins in the number needed. The RCM at any one time is producing coins for no less the 50 other countries, the exact countries are proprietary but it is known that the RCM has produced coins for almost all of the Caribbean countries and Israel. To win these lucrative contracts, the RCM cites it's record of producing hundreds of millions of coins to exact specifications with innovative designs and an excellent quality control that greatly minimizes defective coins reaching circulation.

            "answer_text": "Basically, it's because they are required to do so. It's one of the reasons why 'error' coins are so valuable. Mint employees examine a striking session for errors, and remove those that they do find for destruction. They are usually successful in doing so. The very few that do 'escape' their scrutiny become scarce collectibles for that reason. If they didn't do this, and allowed 'mistakes' to simply pass by, error coins would be quite more abundant, and therefore not quite as valuable or desirable. Indeed, if error coins were very common, they would actually be shunned as \"imperfect\". ",
