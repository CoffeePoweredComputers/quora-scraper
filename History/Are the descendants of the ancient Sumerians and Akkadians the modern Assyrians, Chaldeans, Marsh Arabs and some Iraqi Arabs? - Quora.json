            "answer_text": "The answer is no. The descendants of the ancient Sumerians and Akkadians are not the modern Assyrians, Chaldeans, Marsh Arabs and some Iraqi Arabs. The skeletal remains of the Sumerians were Negroes or Blacks. they were Kushites.  -There is textual evidence supporting a relationship between the founders of Sumer, Elam and Dilmun. Col. Henry Rawlinson , used textual evidence to determine that a link existed between the Mesopotamians to their ancestors in Africa . Rawlinson called these people Kushites. There is a positive relationship between crania from Africa and Eurasia. The archaeologist Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy (Dieulafoy,2004) and Hanberry (1981) maintains that their was a Sub-Saharan strain in Persia . These researchers maintain that it was evident that an Ethiopian dynasty ruled Elam from a perusal of its statuary of the royal family and members of the army ( Dieulafoy, 2004; Dieulafoy, 2010;Hansberry,1981). Dieulafoy (2010 ) noted that the textual evidence and iconography make it clear that the Elamites were Africans, and part of the Kushite confederation .Dieulafoy (2010) made it clear that the Elamites at Susa were Sub-Saharan Africans.  Marcel Dieulafoy and M. de Quatrefages observed that the craniometrics of the ancient Elamites of Susa indicate that they were Sub-Saharan Africans or Negroes (Dieulafoy,2010). Ancient Sub-Saharan African skeletons have also been found in Mesopotamia (Tomczyk et al, 2010). The craniometric data indicates that continuity existed between ancient and medieval Sub-Saharan Africans in Mesopotamia (Ricault & Waelkens,2008). References Dieulafoy, J. 2004.

            "answer_text": "I think genetics found the answer to all the mysteries everyone is mentioning here and elsewhere. The first human-like people originated in the east of Africa- Ethiopia and Somalia region, then spread to the rest of the world. This started even before the last ice age. They couldn\u2019t immigrate north as the weather and terrain was not helpful.. so the spread horizontally east and west only at the start. Not much space to the west, so they crossed the red sea to Yemen and from there they spread to the rest of the world. Going east, they reached all the way to to China, Japan and the Americas. Some migrated north to the middle east- the Levant, Anatolia and Mesopotamia. They crossed back to north Africa then after the end of the ice age. All immigration was caused by the weather.. either getting dry, cold, hot or mild. The red sea was closed at the Yemen-Somalia junction then. The Mediterranean sea was a salty lake with inhabitable surroundings due to evaporation and no rain. The early immigrants and because of the lack of sun in Africa, where pure white skinned and blue eyed with features copied from their much earlier ancestors- the primates family. Eyes wide/small/large, diagonal or strips and nose short/long or wide/slim, and straight/bent up/bent down are all from there. As the ice age receded, the sun became stronger in Africa and subsequent migrants became darker and darker with time. So, the Sumerians, the Anatolian, the Semites, the Indians, the Chinese and the rest are all migrants from Yemen I am afraid. Note also there was plenty of mixing between the various migration waves or homo-sapiens and all the previous others, with some assimilation and annihilation at times. The conclusion is that we are all from Adam and Eve and from the same region of land. None have come by parachute from another place. Regarding slaves, this happened all the time and they were of all colours. If one becomes offended by slavery, then remember that it was a universal guilt resulted mainly due to ignorance. Mind you not all slaves are slaves. Some particularly black slaves became rulers in old Egypt because they had a good capabilities. Even those kept in individual houses, some of them used to rule the house they were supposed to be slaved in- including the house owner. I know the story of at least one black lady like that. She literally carried a stick so that everyone keeps the good behaviour. See my other answers for finer details and evidence. Riadh Al Rabeh's answer to Can't they analyze the DNA of Egyptian mummies and find out if they were white, black, or in-between? Riadh Al Rabeh's answer to What is the origin of language? Riadh Al Rabeh's answer to Where does the name Yamnaya come from? Didn't they used to be called Aryans?  Homo-erectus (Homo erectus - Wikipedia) existed some 2 million years a go in Africa where the temperature at time were not far from those of the polar regions.   See the strong connection between Ethiopia/Somalia, Yemen, Bahrain and the Sumerian regions in the south of Mesopatamia vial the J1-M267 gene marker. The flow is clearly from Africa only. Sudan and north Africa signatures are a spill from north Arabia and also across the red sea from the middle part of it. The terrain is the only reason there was not much migration from Ethiopia to Egypt. ",
