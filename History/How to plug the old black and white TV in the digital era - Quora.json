            "answer_text": "The same as any old CRT TV: You need a digital converter set-top box for receiving and decoding the modern, digital TV signal:  The converter box will then generate the analog 15 kHz video signal (as expected by your old TV set) from the pictures decoded into its digital framebuffer. Since the old B&W TV sets generally did not have baseband video inputs but only an RF input for connecting an antenna, the analog 15 kHz baseband video signal needs to be further converted into an RF signal, mimicking the old-timey analog TV broadcasts. This is done with an RF modulator. Some digital converter boxes (at least the first-generation models which were meant to be used specifically with the old SDTV CRT TVs that people had during the transition period) have a built-in RF modulator, and will provide an RF signal in their RF output which your TV set can tune into. Some later models omit this and will only provide CVBS, S-video, SCART-RGB, or Y\u2019Pb\u2019Pr signals. In the absence of a built-in RF modulator, there are also external RF modulators which will do the same job for any baseband, analog video signal.  The type of a converter box you need depends on the country where you live since different countries use different TV broadcast standards. For Europe, it would generally have to be a DVB-T(2) (terrestrial) or DVB-C (cable) box, or a hybrid DVB-T(2)/C box, covering both modulation standards and use cases. For North America, it would need to be an ATSC box for digital terrestrial or cable signals. ",

            "answer_text": "Plugging it in should be no problem at all. Power sources haven\u2019t changed. Picking up broadcast signals could be challenging, however, as the vast majority of stations no longer broadcast an analog signal. I imagine it would work just fine we\u2019re you to connect it to a digital receiver (set top box), although you made need to get some adapters for the connections to work. Just remember that the tv is unlikely to support HD signals, so temper your expectations re: picture quality. ",
