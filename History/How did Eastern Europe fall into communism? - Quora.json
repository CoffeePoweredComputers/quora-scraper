            "answer_text": "Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman allowed themselves to get hoodwinked by Stalin at the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences. The Americans should have listened to General Patton. He knew the score. It must be said though that the Americans could have pressed their advantage in Central Europe, which many Americans incorrectly identify as being part of Eastern Europe. So\u2026to be fair, the true Eastern Europe was simply too far away, and the Red Army had in fact liberated Poland, the Baltic States, the Ukraine, and part s of Hungary. It was Churchill who essentially gave Stalin much of Central Europe on a little piece of paper. Here is a recent headline from the Deutsche Welle website: \u201c Europe Czechs mark anniversary of liberation by American troops in WWII In May 1945, western Czechoslovakia was liberated by US forces under General Patton in World War II. Amid a week of commemoration in Pilsen, a new monument to the US forces now stands in nearby Konstantinovy Lazne.\u201d I\u2019m guessing that the Americans and the Brits still wanted to keep \u201cUncle Joe\u201d happy, and he no doubt, lost no time in reminding the other two how many Soviet lives had been sacrificed for the cause.

After the WW2, great powers and Russian leaders litterally split countries between them, like they were at the market. This is yours, this is mine\u2026They drew maps of their political influence with a pen in their hand and made this dirty trade on Yalta, between 4\u201311 february 1945, probably while they were drunk. Yalta Treaty changed life into bad to million of people throwing these countries into the greedy hands of CCCP, against their will. Learn this! ",
