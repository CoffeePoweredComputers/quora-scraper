            "answer_text": "It\u2019s the phenomenon where a given culture overrules and becomes dominant away from the nation/region of it\u2019s creation. Cultural Imperialism is something of a loaded term, however. The classic example would be the use of French as the language of court in Europe for a very long time. If you wanted to be taken seriously, you had to be fluent in French, because all the Serious, Important, Credible people spoke it as a common tongue. France was seen as the culture hub of civilisation, and therefore if you wanted to appear as anything other than a savage, you\u2019d want to import some French stuff to appear sophisticated. The ancient Chinese did similar things, with their culture supplanting and becoming dominant over the nations of it\u2019s neighbours. They did things in the Chinese way rather than the local way. They used Chinese letters, read chinese books, read Chinese news, sort of thing. Of course these days the big Cultural Hegemon is America. We all speak English if we\u2019re educated, listen to American music, have American companies tell us what products to buy, watch American movies. My mother gets very cross if I ever use the term \u2018faucet\u2019 rather than \u2018tap\u2019, because the former is seen as something of an American term for the same thing, and that\u2019s cultural imperialism. I\u2019m referring to an Australian thing by it\u2019s American name. Like the American thing is the first, original, REAL term, and the other term\u2019s just a local variation on the PROPER word. Historically speaking, we can see Cultural Imperialism in the adoption of Western uniforms for the armies of China and Japan. These were seen as proper, modern, sensible uniforms for armies using modern methods, rather than the quaint and primitive ways they used to before civilisation was brought to their nations. The Japanese stopped wearing their traditional kimonos, and started wearing suits. It\u2019s a fashion, little more, but the CULTURE of Japan had in some respects, been replaced with the culture of a foreign power. It often happens because a given culture conquered another one. The Ancient Romans conquered many other cultures, and soon the cultures were doing things in the Roman way. The ancient Muslims conquered many of the other Arab/Persian tribes, and soon those Arabs did things the Muslim way. In modern days, this is often a function of economic power. America makes the most popular movies and music, and everyone wishes to listen to them. These songs and movies show pictures and sounds from America, and people copy them. Sometimes Imperialism can happen because another power is influential, and you wish to impress them, or make them more willing to deal with you. Other times it\u2019s a matter of economic power. After WW2, most of the world\u2019s things were produced by one English speaking nation or another, and while the French and Germans and British and Dutch and Italians didn\u2019t want to speak each other\u2019s language, they could ALL speak English as a sort of common language for trade and diplomacy, and that was convenient because why speak Italian, when Italy isn\u2019t very important? America was very important, and Americans speak English. China is trying to do the same thing, with their Confucius Insitutes. Get people interested in Chinese things. Soft power. Cultural Imperialism. Strength through culture. Of course it can backfire, or otherwise present itself in strange ways.  These Japanese are dressed in the fashions of 1950s America. It used to be an American thing, but not any more. It\u2019s not an American thing, because nobody does this in America. The Japanese do, and now it\u2019s a strange Japanese custom. Maybe America will copy the Japanese now. This song is about Cultural Imperialism: It\u2019s meaning is: whatever our country was before, it is now like America.  ",

            "answer_text": "Cultures must \u2013 first and foremost \u2013 be functional, i.e., a successful way of living for the practitioners of a given culture, otherwise that culture will be abandoned because its practitioners have all died, or have all chosen another set of cultural practices to adopt as better than what they had been doing. Globalization offers increased knowledge of other cultures and ways of living to everyone, which in turn presents increased competition for \u201ctraditional cultures.\u201d Those traditional cultures will persist if they work for their practitioners, and won\u2019t if they don\u2019t, when compared to any/all other cultures of the world. Everyone gets to choose \u2026 unless someone else arrogantly prevents them. \u201cCultural Imperialism\u201d is Political Rhetoric employed primarily by purveyors (and to a lesser degree, consumers/adherents) of unsuccessful (i.e., not sufficiently popular) culture in an attempt to excuse their failure to attract sufficient adherents to their culture: they blame the competition. It has its equivalent in Dating and Relationships in the caterwaul, \u201che stole my woman!\u201d which completely discounts that the woman in question has Freedom (is not, in advanced cultures, chattel) and is the one making the choice. Slightly less often, purveyors of unsuccessful culture use other rhetoric to disparage the taste, intelligence, breeding, etc., of those who chose other than the complainers\u2019 culture. ",
