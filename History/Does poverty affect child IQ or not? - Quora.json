            "answer_text": "Original Question: Does poverty affect child IQ or not? It certainly can do, but poverty in itself isn\u2019t the direct cause. What frequently happens with people who\u2019re living in poverty is that their diet is incomplete and is lacking in certain essential vitamins, minerals, fatty acids etc., which can have a consequential effect on the physical development of children, including the development of their brain. This can result in a whole raft of different conditions during later life. Additionally, it\u2019s often found that children from poorer backgrounds are more likely to skip school, pay less attention in class, and show a lower degree of awareness as to the importance of education - \u201cnone of my friends bother, why should I\u201d. Whilst these latter points don\u2019t affect IQ directly, they certainly affect the way in which the child will perceive and perform in tests, including those to assess IQ. Having said that, many highly influential people in the world today have come from very poor backgrounds, even those where they\u2019ve spent part of their life in poverty, so there\u2019s no absolute answer to this. Drive, ambition, and determination to succeed can often override a lack of IQ - to a certain point - since overall intelligence is a combination of several different factors, IQ being just one of them, albeit an important one. A single sentence answer to the question would therefore be that childhood poverty certainly can negatively affect IQ, but that\u2019s by far from the end of the story for those so affected. ",

            "answer_text": "Strictly speaking, it does not, but again it depends on your definition of poverty and the kind of society you live in, for example in Denmark where I\u2019m from, what we\u2019d call relative poverty, would have little impact on IQ, though there would of course be an impact, insignificant though it may be. That being said, interpreting the question as I\u2019m sure it should be, poverty does indeed affect a child\u2019s IQ, and there are a number of real world examples too, like certain African countries where the average IQ is below 60, which is almost unfathomable low.First and foremost there is malnutrition, which especially at an early age can affect a child\u2019s intellectual development.Secondly there\u2019s intellectual stimuli, or lag thereof. This one is perhaps more important than people think, but it can make a big difference. First as a baby, where there is limited interaction, but the child is more susceptible than it will ever be again, and then later in childhood, where the child, with guidance, can be left to take this development on by itself, going to school, perhaps learning a musical instrument, playing with Technic lego, or something like that. So in conclusion, yes, poverty does indeed affect IQ, however, bad decisions are perhaps more likely to do so, in the western world. For example when parents decide that it\u2019s a great idea to enforce veganism on their children, or a never ending diet, due to the child being a bit chubby, rather that accepting that this is actually pretty normal for children, even healthy, to be a bit chubby, or indeed simply insisting on a so called \u201chealthy\u201d diet, being low fat and low carb, forgetting that fat is the fuel of the brain, and is hugely important for a child\u2019s development, and then of course carbs, which helps to fuel the physical activities, which again is important. Home schooling. Though I do not have any evidence, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m right to claim that home schooling will have an effect also, due to limited social interaction, limited opportunismes for personal developments, etc.You can add more to the list yourself. It really is quite intuitive. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course,it does. And it is always a negative effect. Malnutrition, disease, violence, abuse, prejudice, lack of schooling and other things that are known to harm intellectual development are far more likely to occur among the poor. Indeed, such things can actually be considered the definition of poverty, as in the Human Development Index. It is true that poverty can be the result of lower intelligence. But it is undeniable that it is also a relevant cause. Of course, there are cases when outstanding intellect was found among those who were born and even raised in poverty. But these are the bizarre exceptions, not the rule. Those individuals are intelligent in spite of thepoverty. Personally, besides the obvious importance of the aspects of human suffering per se, the hindering of intelligence is one of the main arguments to justify public and private efforts towards the eradication of poverty.
