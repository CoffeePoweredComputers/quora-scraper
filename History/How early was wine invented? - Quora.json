            "answer_text": "If you define \u201cwine\u201d as fermented grape juice, quite a few Middle Eastern countries claim wine invention through discoveries of clues related to the first wine making (usually large amphoras where they would store grape juice). However, there\u2019s a sort of consensus that the 1st wine was made in Iran in the city of Shiraz, around 5000 BC. Ironically, any alcohol is forbidden in that country today. Egypt, Georgia, Armenia, globally the Ottoman empire (Turquey) also claim wine was invented there initially. At that time, \u201cwine\u201d wasn\u2019t used for its good taste or food pairing though, but mainly to hydrate (!) since it was much safer to drink than water. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, it is unlikely that the wine was invented and very likely that it was accidentally discovered. A lot of people would say that wine was made for the first time in France, maybe in Italy, perhaps any part of Iberian peninsula would be a great guess, but few would say names like Turkey, Armenia, Georgia, and Iran. What all of these countries under the shadows of the Caucasus have in common is some evidence of winemaking that dates back years before Christ. It is very difficult to say without any doubt that they were the places where accidentally the first grapes were fermented to wine. What we have available are clues that suggest it like some fossils from 8000 b.c to 3500 b.c of what would be the first winery in Armenia, indications of vine farming in Turkey, and rests of grapes inside ceramic jars in Georgia. These pieces of evidence indicate that probably the first time wine was made can be even older. ",
