            "answer_text": "History as we know has been written by the victors of the particular situation. It could be war or political move or anything for that matter. The viewpoint of the victors is penned and gets narrated to everyone else as the truth. Even the viewpoint of the losing side is written by the victors. Take for example: Adolf Hitler killed 6 million Jews. This is an unquestioned statement today, treated as a fact. He is called the most evil person ever to have lived. OTH, Joseph Stalin - is considered a hero. How different were the Gulags from the concentration camps I would ask? Why isn't he called the most evil person alive? The answer is because Joseph Stalin won and Adolf Hitler lost. Now the victorious side has many individuals involved who all have perspectives that are different from the other's. As time passes by each one stands up to narrate his/er side of the story and that's how we have many versions of a single situation and that how we manipulate history. ",

            "answer_text": "BECAUSE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN IT FOR YOURSELFThat's the truth. Manipulating history has always been an art and it will always be one. No doubt. Why is there so much of skepticism on whether the church is the true church or no. Try reading Dan Brown's book. It conveys the same thing over and over again. Now you may call that fiction or creation of mind but what if that is true. Not to give any spoilers if you have not read his book, he explains each and every occurance that you see around you and the myth that has been created for you to surrender in front of the creators. So that you never question the truth. In Hindu mythology, Shiva is always seen as a God, an immortal being, because he had taken poison for himself when it was to take toll on the world. But Amish Tripathi, in his book on Shiva Trilogy actually explains all the list of events that look genuine and lead to obvious conclusion that Shiva was a man. If you are Indian, and you know Shiva, ask yourself this - \"What is the meaning of Har Har Mahadev\". It actually means that anyone can be great, they just need guts - Har Har - \"everyone is\" Mahadev. All of these evidences lead to a common conclusion: Shiva was real and he was a man. My friend Akhilesh has written a beautiful article on this: http://burstingdynamics.com/article.php?article_id=14. Still we believe that Shiva as someone we can't understand. History is always crafted for enjoyment my friend. ALWAYS ",
