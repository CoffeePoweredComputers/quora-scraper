            "answer_text": "After the colonies were established not very much. Most of that was destroyed during the civil war. The damage done by slavery far outweighs any benefit gained. The US would have been much better off if we could have found a way to ease out of slavery right from our founding. The problem was the abolitionists insisted on immediate and refused to compromise and the slavers were almost as stubborn. Slaves were uncommon in the NE, unheard of in the Northern frontiers and only common in small parts of the SW. Even where they were common they were the Illegals of their time. Slaves depressed wages and thus hurt the economy and made it harder for the South to industrialize. More so, once the cotton gin was invented, slaves were obsolete. The bulk of them used for ginning and picking cotton. Share cropping turned out to be cheaper and more effective than slaves. A plantation owner was only obligated for wages or share in that arrangement. With slaves they had considerable expense and obligation. Slave labor was not only not free, it was actually downright expensive. Food, medicine, shelter, clothing not just for slaves but dependents added up quickly. An employee was much cheaper. All you are out with them is wages. Employees are harder workers. They work for their own gain, slaves required watching and would passively sabotage every chance they got. This meant not only did free workers cost considerably less than a slave, they outperformed them and carried less overhead while doing the work. Thus slavery hurt the economy rather than helped it. Reduced production while increasing expenses. If slave owners didn\u2019t have such considerable investments already tied into slaves they\u2019d come to that conclusion on their own. The catch was ginning cotton which was a very manually intensive process that it\u2019d been difficult to hire people to do. Outside of agriculture slaves generally only did things like domestic service, dock work and similar functions. Hiring an employee was the norm for this elsewhere and could have easily been replaced these uses of slaves. Slaves were owned only by wealthy individuals and corporations generally. For the average Joe slaves were unfair competition. Instead of hiring a blacksmith, a slave was trained to do the blacksmithing taking business away from local craftsmen. Carpenters and other skilled trades suffered and it harmed their standard of living. ",

            "answer_text": " Slaves contributed much to American wealth. Slaves worked very hard to develop land, grow crops, cut timber, raise livestock, build infrastructure, make things and generally were productive. At the age of 27, they became profitable to their owners and remained profitable well into their 60\u2019s or 70\u2019s in many cases. They were productive from the time they were 16 years of age. After the War, it was estimated that a female former slave worked 1,400 hours per year less than when she was a slave. The end of slavery in the USA contributed to American and Southern poverty for both whites and blacks. Time on the Cross explains the economics of American slave labor and debunked the myth that it was not profitable. Larger plantations were almost totally self-sufficient, producing most of the food, clothing and shelter needed on the plantation. Plantations usually had to buy iron, salt, sugar and some vehicles, but otherwise they made, raised, grew or harvested everything they needed. Slaves consumed 88% of their own economic production according to Time on the Cross, so it is not true they received \u201cnothing\u201d for their labor. After slavery ended, one former slave declared: \u201cThe ten million Negroes inhabiting this country, who themselves or whose ancestors went through the school of American slavery, are in a stronger and more hopeful condition, materially, intellectually, morally, and religiously, than is true of an equal number of black people in any other portion of the globe.\u201d \u2013 Booker T. Washington A major point about slavery that needs emphasis today is this: Slaves were never incarcerated as punishment. Slaves were the law-abiding people in the old days, and the whites were the outlaws! The formal legal system punished very few slaves. If a valuable slave were accused of murder or a serious crime, his master would hire the best lawyer to defend him. Slavery was most unjust to the talented slaves whose career ambitions were very limited; but slavery treated less talented young offenders better than they are treated today, mainly by making them work hard.
