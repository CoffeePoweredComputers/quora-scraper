            "answer_text": "Yes and no. It's complicated. Historically, Brazil was 3 things: Aristocrat, because the Captaincies of Brazil that portugueses nobles founded in Brazil was like a semi-feudalism, then the slavery and then when Portugal made Rio de Janeiro de capital of Portuguese Empire. Added to the fact that our institutions were formed as an economy of natural resources, this made our culture quite elitist and with a lot of incentives to concentrate income and wealth. Despite this elitism, our aristocracy was never very strong as it was in Europe. There has never been a well-defined caste system, class divisions existed but it was very fragile. I believe that this enables an abolition of slavery and a peaceful transition to the republican model instead a civil war and revolution.Military Republican \u2014 or more precisely, positivism. After the Paraguayan war, the Brazilian military was strong. When there was a new generation of them in power, none of them was satisfied with the monarchical model of Brazil. This is the ideology of the Brazilian Armed Forces. The focus is on republicanism, centralism, nationalism and developmentalism. It was they who put on our flag the \"order and progress\". They have a semi-fascist mentality, in the sense of national ownership of means of production considered important, fetish with industrialization, laborism (CLT and other labor rules) and authoritarianism. These things resemble the aspects of socialism, but they don\u2019t have a socialist ideological background. The maximum it has is Republican ideas of equality before the law.Also, the illusion here is to overestimate the power of the military. They aren\u2019t part of our aristocracy, they are just a bureaucracy aside with some power. More importantly, they never abolished our aristocracy and tried to replace it \u2014 on the contrary, they always had to make alliances with them to come to power. This is the main reason why they always left the power peacefully. And the main reason why \u201cequality before the law\u201d is just on paper.In 1988 a third political movement was born in Brazil: the social democracy. Coming from resistance to censorship of the military dictatorship, they had a leftist ideology but a middle-class mindset. So, they made a copy of what they thought was the most successful model in the world and put in our constitution. This was quite easy for them because this ideological project could also be an personal economic project: with these new \u201crights\u201d the middle class could be part of the power being well paid and privileged public officials[1]. More radical versions of them are political parties such as the PT, but less radical and updated with social-democracy in rest of the world, PSDB, adopted a left wing version of neoliberalism.The problem here is, again, this political movement was additive, and at no time did they strike against the old powers. Then we have a social-democracy in the role, with state-owned companies, centralization and semi-fascist/socialist-like worker laws and with an aristocratic culture. On paper, we look socialist, at least in social-democracy sense + some centralization. In practice, we are lot aristocrat with some centralism-nationalist and a middle class elitism. All our socialist attempts have become elitist excuses to our aristocracy and middle class maintain their privileges.

            "answer_text": "Definitively not. Brazil adopts a capitalist economic model and a democratic and pluralist political model. State is quite present is some sectors, like oil production, public transport and energy, but most economical activities are dominated by private companies. Press is highly free and can criticizes governments without restrictions (censorship was abolished in 1986). Transnational corporations have a massive presence in the country and control sectors like vehicle production, pharmaceutics, electronics, and cosmetics.  Since 2003, Brazil is under a left-wing government (with the leadership of PT, Partido dos Trabalhadores, the Workers' Party). But those political leaders did adopt a light, more centered profile to attract electors and to get credibility from investors. The leftism is more visible in social programs to help income of poor families and to facilitate access to house purchase. Acquisition of cars and domestic facilities were also stimulated. In other hand, financial sector works the same way of USA and Europe, and most international banks get their highest profit margins in Brazil due to high interest taxes. Internal politics is also democratic and open, with dozens of parties representing a vasty gamma of tendencies. Elections occur regularly since 1988 with no institutional disrupt. President, Governors, and Mayors are appointed to a 4-year rule, as also are state and federal deputies. Just senators hold an 8-year rule (like the USA model, Brazil has two legislative houses). In the meantime there were political crisis, as the death of president Tancredo Neves and the impeachment of president Fernando Color. In both situations, the constitutional rules were followed without any kind of rupture \u2014 so usual in the past. When one compares Brazil to other South-American countries with left-wing governments (Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Uruguay), it is clear that Brazil is by far the most moderate one. Anyway, in foreign politics this period was marked by a more independent action. The country actively worked to increase the importance of BRICS block (with Russia, India, China and South Africa). Critique to USA procedures, very light in former governments, become more visible since 2003. Anyway, USA is still the greater commercial partner of Brazil \u2014 although China would soon take this position due to their huge imports of Brazilian commodities. Some characteristics usually associated to socialism are actually result of the complex and unequal Brazilian society. Labor rights are a good example: Brazil has a large, complex and detailed set of rules applied to work. Most companies claim this is an excessive intervention of the State into private business. But these rules were build during decades (since 1940s) to ensure minimal respect to the worker. In other countries, there is no need to write down so much rights because the companies naturally adopt them. But is less developed countries, without these guarantees the worker would suffer a suppression of even basic conditions. A related issue is the number of judicial disputes regarding labor law because the rules are most of times not followed by the companies. ",
