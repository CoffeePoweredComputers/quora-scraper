            "answer_text": "According to the Vision Council, more than two thirds of us suffer from Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS). The cause is too much time in front of digital screens, and the symptoms include dry or red eyes, blurred vision, eye twitches, fatigue, headaches, and even back and neck pain. Taking frequent breaks can help alleviate CVS. But experts agree: A pair of computer glasses is a wise investment that can greatly enhance the quality of your screen time. Here\u2019s why: Of Glaring Concern Light bouncing off the glass of your digital screen can create a glaring obstacle to proper vision. Reflected light increases the difference between the light and dark areas of the screen, causing our pupils to struggle to keep up, dilating open and close, until eventually our eyes protest. Computer glasses feature a special coating designed to keep fatiguing screen glare at a minimum. Focusing In Most prescription eyewear corrects either near or far vision. Reading glasses are designed for close work. Unfortunately, most of us position our computer screens in an intermediate zone about two feet in front of us. Then we compound the problem by glancing back and forth between close paperwork and the intermediate distance of our screens. And since our eyes aren\u2019t as young and strong as they used to be, is it any wonder our vision gets blurry and headachy? A good pair of computer glasses can help keep you focused in the zone \u2014 the intermediate zone that\u2019s easiest on your eyes. Posture Perfect Many of us try to compensate for less than perfect mid-range vision by leaning forward in our chairs. We also crane our necks back so we can see the tops of our screens through the bottoms of our prescription or reader bifocals. These ocular gymnastics can be a literal pain in the neck. Sound familiar? If the answer is yes, a pair of computer glasses may definitely be worth a try.

            "answer_text": "In general, people who may have trouble focusing the eyes at the typical distance of a computer monitor should wear computer glasses. This would be roughly in the 2/3m to 1m range. Who are these people? These are generally people who are presbyopic (past the age of 40, with poorer focusing ability of the eyes), and are emmetropic (see well in distance), hyperopic (longsighted), or very shortsighted. Mildly shortsighted people (~-1D) will find vision without glasses great for computers. Younger people who are not presbyopic yet should not need these glasses unless they are very longsighted. ",
