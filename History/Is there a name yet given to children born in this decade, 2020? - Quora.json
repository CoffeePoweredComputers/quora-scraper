With the 30-year time period of 2016\u20132046 fitting the bill of the Duo-Dynamic generation there would be a type of Woodstock effect that would grandmother/grandfather in those born in the 2016\u20132019 range as the Duo-teeno\u2019s of the Duo-Dynamic generation.} \u201cRe-Visionists\u201d befits the situation as does \u201cDuo-Dynamics\u201d but nothing\u2019s firmed up yet. 2019 marks the end of the Generation Z aka the \u2018snowflake generation\u2019 with Generation Alpha one of the proposed names for the follow-up generation born in the 2020\u20132050 range. However politically, the 2020 decade itself is already slated to be one of a more perfect vision, 20/20 hindsight in viewing America\u2019s past and 20/20 foresight in looking to the USA\u2019s future. Which leaves the precise name for those born in the 2020\u2019s still up for grabs but most likely vision related with a computer-like connection with action to it. With the reboot and rebirth of the Founders original intent for the Nation presently underway, mathematically speaking those born in the 2020\u2019s are in the \u2018Visionary 2.0\u2019 decade. The Duo-Dynamics of the 2020\u2019s won\u2019t suffer from the myopic, political mono-vision of Generation Z. They will be the leaders and people of action for generations to come. ",
