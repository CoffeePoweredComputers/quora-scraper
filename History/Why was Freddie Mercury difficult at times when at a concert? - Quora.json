            "answer_text": "Are you talking about before, after or during? All of the above? His bantering with the audience? He was only having fun when he said \u201cF*ck you.\u201d His roadie described it well the way he teased and tantalized and won audiences over. \u201cHe was the master. He would tease and cajole his audience like an experienced lover, using strength, stealth and power to take control. Drawing his conquests in closer, he would slow the pace to show his own vulnerability, before taking them back to the heights of excitement and final consummation. Hence his announcement, \u2018I\u2019d like to f*ck you all!\u2019\u201d His PA tried to say that Freddie would deliberately start fights with boyfriends or others before important shows in order to pump himself up for big performances but then in the example he used the fight happened by chance so I don\u2019t trust his analysis on this nor some other of his \u201ctheories\u201d about Freddie. The example he used was before the huge performance in Rio. Freddie flew his boyfriend in and they were getting along fine. The boyfriend left to go out and then Freddie who was trapped in his room because of wild Freddie mania in South America happened to see the boyfriend on the promenade below with a boyfriend he brought over on the flight. Of course, there was a big blowout but it wasn\u2019t instigated by Freddie and depended instead on chance. Also, although Jim was with him in the limo and backstage before Live Aid and before his performance of Barcelona with Montserrat there was no fighting. These were two of his biggest performances. So the theory just doesn\u2019t seem to hold water. People have talked about how confident Freddie seemed before performances as if it was nothing to walk out in front of tens of thousands of people but Jim said he was actually quite nervous before performances including Live Aid and he was extremely nervous before performing with Montserrat. As everyone knows when we\u2019re stressed and on edge arguments, harsh words and fights are much more likely to happen. Freddie was such a perfectionist in his case it could even be worse. But in spite of the nerves once he stepped out onto the stage the crowd would sweep him up into the act and they\u2019d forget their nervousness. No one was allowed in the band\u2019s dressing rooms immediately after Queen\u2019s concerts. Not even the wives. The band were all such perfectionists that they\u2019d be very upset with themselves and each other if there were hitches in their show. They\u2019d yell at each other and occasionally trash the room to some degree and it was not described as just being Freddie although I have a \u201chunch\u201d it was mostly Freddie and Roger. Lol. Roger once kicked a wall so hard over a monitor malfunction he had to be taken to the ER to have his foot X-rayed and then there was the time he kicked his drum set across the stage. I can\u2019t see Brian or John getting so worked up as those other two. But they\u2019d also discuss what worked and didn\u2019t work so that they could learn from it. (One of the reason the critics hated them was such professionalism. How dare they? Rock stars were supposed to stumble out drunk and piss on their audiences.) Their roadies said that no matter the level of fury after the concerts within 30 minutes or so they\u2019d all be laughing together and on friendly terms and others would be allowed into the dressing room. There\u2019s a lot of adrenaline involved in performances and it heightens emotions and needs a physical outlet which is why exercise can be such a good coping mechanism for a stressful life. You actually sweat out and breathe out some of the toxic chemicals produced. ",

So he needed to be alone or with Just a few people around. with queen the before and after shows were the most difficult because there were a lot of adrenaline. And after they were usually the 4 in the same room fighting on what wasn\u2019t perfect during the concert, but in 30 min it was finished and time to party or get to the hotel. but as soon as Freddie was in front of the audience he gave 100% of himself and was totally in his element, that\u2019s why he was a true artist. Even when he was not well he didn\u2019t let anything disturb the connection he had with his fans <3 ",
