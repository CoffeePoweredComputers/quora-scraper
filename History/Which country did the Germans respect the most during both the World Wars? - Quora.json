            "answer_text": "I am going to second the answer of Torax Muller with regard to the German respect for the British. I translated (from Yiddish) the memoir of a Jewish soldier in the Russian Army in the First World War who was interned for the last year of the war in a camp whose location I can only transliterate as Tschersk. He describes (here translated in a mixture of English and Yiddish) the attitude of the Germans to their Russian, English and Italian prisoners. He begins with the Russians, who owed their low status partly to the fact that since the Revolution, they had no recognized governemntal authority to stand up for their rights: \u201c\u2026So they existed in a kind of legal vacuum, with no system of rules to protect them...k\u00e9in gesetz, k\u00e9in shum internatsionaler \u00e2b-mach, w\u00e2s soll besch\u00fctzen s\u00e9iere recht. They were accordingly burdened with kol aveydes-perekh. Everyone took advantage of them. And for their part, h\u00e2ben s\u00e9e nebbekh geschwiggen un gefolgt (obeyed). Even they looked upon themselves, wie s\u00e9e wollten takkeh geh\u00f6rt zu a niederign klass menschen. And so, like true slaves, they resigned themselves to their bitter fate. \u201cThe English prisoners, on the other hand, h\u00e2ben d\u00e2 gelebt wie s\u00e9e wollten sich gefunnen bei s\u00e9ier taten in wein-g\u00e2rten! They were better dressed, r\u00e9iner un zichtiger. They were not dependent only (bl\u00f5s) auf'n misernem bissel speis vun der allgem\u00e9iner lager-k\u00fcch...instead, they received zu-geschickten speis vun der h\u00e9im, as well as special packages vun'm R\u00f5tn Kreutz. They stuck together, ver-\u00e9inigt unter an \u00e9igener ordnung. \u201cThey knew all their rights according to international law. If the camp administration tried to deprive them of something, welchen es is punkt in'm \"Internatsionalen \u00c2b-mach far Gefangene\", h\u00e2ben s\u00e9e bald protestiert un gefo\u2019dert s\u00e9ier recht. H\u00e2t men takkeh var s\u00e9e i derekh eretz gehat, i moyreh gehat. If a German soldier, a land-sturmist, had to stand watch over the English barracks, is er bald verwandelt geworen in g\u00e2r an ander menschen. Er h\u00e2t sich baz\u00f5gen (conducted himself) zu s\u00e9e mit tolerantz un respekt. \u201cThese English m'yukhusim, even in their captivity, had their own slaves, \u00fcber welche s\u00e9e h\u00e2ben aus-ge\u2019\u00fcbt s\u00e9ier memsholah (exercised their authority). These were none other than unsere biedne, Russische gefangene. For a bit of soup mit die zhabkehs, or a piece of ferdn-fl\u00e9isch, which they themselves were above eating...or even a piece of bread with ground-up straw, or for a puff on a cigarette, which the English were only too willing to share...h\u00e2ben unsere Russische gekehrt un ger\u00e9inigt s\u00e9iere barracken, gewaschen s\u00e9iere w\u00e4sch un geputzt (polished) s\u00e9iere sch\u00fchech. \u201cEven worse off than the Russians were the Italians, who lived under the most miserable conditions. If the Russians were at least regarded by the Germans as a nutzlechen (useful) element, far \"arbetsame kerlen\", h\u00e2ben die selbe Deutschen gekuckt auf die Italiaener wie auf werim (vermin). \u201cThis was partly on account of the fact, w\u00e2s Italieh h\u00e2t in der letzter minut ver-raten (betrayed) dem drei-bund zwischen Deutschland, \u00d6streich-Ungarn un Italia. Furthermore, as a group they projected an image of dejection and slovenliness; s\u00e9e h\u00e2ben gemacht auf itlechen a schweren eindr\u00fcck. The harsh climate, zu w\u00e2s s\u00e9e seinen nischt gewe\u2019en zu-gew\u00f6hnt (accustomed), with its cold damp winds, which blew in from the neighboring Baltic Sea...all these things took a heavy toll on their health.

            "answer_text": "The British in both. In WWI they did not expect the British to join the war and the Kaiser Wilhem II was very fond and blood related to the Monarch of Great Britain. During WWII Hitler never wanted to invade Great Britain. He never even wanted to dicuss any plans and considered them honorable Aryans. The greatest Motivation Hitler had for Operation Barbarossa ( Invasion of USSR ) was to \u201cscare\u201d the British into peacetalks. Hitler also tried to negotiate a peace after every successful invasion. After Poland, after France, after the Balkan invaision, after invading Scandinavia. Funny thing, even though the Germans and their leaders were very fond of the British, the British were never fond of Germans.War Propaganda in WWI on British side was so effective, that the average British soldier thought that Germans ate babies, cut off breasts of women et cetera.And in WWII Churchill never wanted to surrender to Germany and urged the British to win at all cost. Even Queen Elizabeth helped the war effort by repairing vehicles. No British even thought of surrendering to Nazi Germany. ",
