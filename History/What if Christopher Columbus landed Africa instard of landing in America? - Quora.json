            "answer_text": "He would have probably been detained by the Portuguese crown who already had a presence in West Africa, and who were enemies of the Castilian (Spanish) crown, under whose charter Columbus was sailing. But that wouldn\u2019t make much sense because Columbus was convinced that if he sailed due west he would reach Asia, which is where he was attempting to go. He was an excellent dead reckoning navigator and would not have mistaken south for west, although his reckoning while in the Caribbean did lead him to believe that he was at around the 40th parallel.

Mayan and Inca people, with their ancient knowledge of the land and universe would have built their own empires in American lands and their great culture would have flourished across the continents and the world.
