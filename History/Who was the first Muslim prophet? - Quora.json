            "answer_text": "Muhammad was the first Muslim prophet. All the Biblical prophets were Jews. Quran adopted stories from the Torah and the Bible. Muhammad was not a true prophet. He was not from the lineage of Abraham ,Issac and Jacob. Muhammad did not preach in the name of Yahwey . He did not even know the name of God. Muhammad could not do any miracles. There was no prophecy about Muhammad in the Torah and Gospel. Quran cotradicts both the Torah and Gospel. ",

            "answer_text": "Islamic scholars agree there is a difference between a Rasool (Messenger) and a Nabi (Prophet). All messengers are prophets but not all prophets are messengers. Eg. Prophet Musa(Moses) pbuh was also a Messenger because he recieved the Taurat (Book) or new shariah (laws). While his Brother Prophet Harun (Aaron)pbuh was just a Prophet because he was preaching the message of his Brother.  There are 25 Prophets mentioned by name in the Quran though Muslims believe there are more.  The first Nabi is Prophet Adam (pbuh). The first Rasool is Prophet Nuh (Noah) pbuh. Hope this answers your Question. Prophets and messengers in Islam - Wikipedia ",
