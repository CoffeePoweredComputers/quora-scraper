            "answer_text": "Longevity From the Xia dynasty (if it actually existed) to the people\u2019s republic, China has had a long and very fascinating history that has spanned over thousands of years. I currently live in Shenzhen, China and have been for about two years now. However, I've been interested in Chinese history since college. Although I majored in U.S. history, I actively sought out opportunities to learn about various country\u2019s histories from around the world. This included China\u2019s. The country has gone through some of the most troubling times (Tiananmen Square protests, Nanjing Massacre, foreign invasion, opium wars, mongol rivalry, etc) And still, today, it remains as one of the stronger nations in the world. China has also been responsible for some of the world\u2019s most useful inventions; the most notable being paper, gun powder, and the compass. Additionally, it has had a number of interesting leaders and dynasties You see her:  This is Wu Zetian. China\u2019s one and only female Empress during the Tang Dynasty (China\u2019s Golden Age). Recognize him:  This is LiuXiu, also known as Emperor Guangwu of Han. He was the founder of the infamous Han Dynasty which expanded China\u2019s global influence significantly. I\u2019m American. And I appreciate my country\u2019s history, despite how dark it could be at times. However, I believe part of being a great historian is being open-minded to the cultures, customs, and traditions that make up the rest of the world. China\u2019s history deserves to be taught in Western High Schools and Universities. Mainly because of the poor opinions many westerners seem to have about China. The media loves bashing China and making it seem like it\u2019s an undesirable place consisting of strict censorship and a constant violation of Human Rights. However, this is false. With a country as vast and historically significant as China, one would think more people would want to learn more about the 5,000 or so years of history is has before forming biased judgments based on what\u2019s presented from ill informed media outlets.

            "answer_text": "Over Christmas and New Year 73/74 I visited Japan and was shown around, and even stayed with several former exchange students. Many of the temples and gardens we visited were built by Chinese architects and builders. Much of the prized culture derived from China. On my return I restructured my studies around China and completed an honours degree in Chinese politics and history as well as studying the language. I became fascinated by the communist movement in China and how it had rebuilt a new virtuous society. In 1978 I won a government scholarship to study at the Beijing Language Institute ( now Beijing Language and Culture University) and completed three sebesters of study there before leaving to help open a trade consultancy office in the Beijing Hotel. It was an incredibly exciting time as China transformed from the chaos of the post-Cultural Revolution disaster into a modern society based largely on free enterprise. Although initially shocked by the abandonment of Maoism, I quickly saw how Chinese people enjoyed their new freedom to become wealthy, or even just comfortably well off. I saw the adoption of competitive manufacturing industry in the 80\u2019s, the new social freedom of the 90\u2019s; the growth of foreign investment and subsequent trade on the 00\u2019s and the massive growth of state of the art infrastructure in the 10\u2019s. What an incredible social and political revolution to observe on the ground over 39 years! I left this year concerned that the present administration is undoing many of the elements central to that process. The CCP, which has been deliberately sidelined, is now being restored to 1950\u2019s levels in a Neo-Leninist fashion. The social and political freedoms after the 90\u2019s have been repealed and those who speak out going to gaol. The foreign investors, once uniformly optimistic now feeling harried and unwanted. It was time for me to leave. The Dengist period may be denounced as revisionist, corrupt, and decadent. But the Chinese people will Long regard it with fondness. I know I will. ",
