            "answer_text": "No, he was not put in charge of England, he was put in charge of the United Kingdom. He was important because he led the United Kingdom during the Second World War, any PM that did that would be considered important. Fat? Yes, looks that way. I don\u2019t see how that affects his abilities as a politician though. Drunk? Certainly he is considered to have drunk a lot. Womaniser? I don\u2019t know, but again, it\u2019s not related to his abilities as a politician. Was he a hindrance more than a help? I don\u2019t know, but stuff about him being fat hardly gets to the bottom of it. I think it\u2019s fair to criticise him as a racist (perhaps even a white supremacist), but personal attacks on his weight don\u2019t add anything to the discussion about him. If you don\u2019t think much of Churchill, that\u2019s totally fair, but you demean your own arguments with superficial comments on the man\u2019s weight. ",

            "answer_text": "He was right about the Nazis. That was the main thing. Many British politicians hoped Hitler was lying about his intentions. Winston never believed it.He was an amazing public speaker and a shrewd manipulator of the public mood. Britain\u2019s main problem in 1939 was morale - not immediately seeking peace and instead focussing on preventing defeat until something came along to help.By the time he became prime minister his natural tendency to take risks had been tempered by willingness to take advice. British policy during WWII was to try everything, but only on a scale that could be allowed to fail, and then work with the things that were proven. This was largely a reflection of Churchill\u2019s style - SOE basically failed, but Bletchley Park succeeded. A more hidebound Prime Minister would not have invested in either.He proved later to be a poor peacetime Prime Minister, but in the circumstances of 1939 its hard to imagine anyone better. If the King had named Halifax as PM instead of Churchill, which could easily have happened, its hard to see events taking the same course they did and in all likelihood they would have been worse. A reasonable person would have sought peace with Germany immediately. Sometimes the right thing to do is to be unreasonable. ",
