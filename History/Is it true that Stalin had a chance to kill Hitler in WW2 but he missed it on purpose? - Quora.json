            "answer_text": "He actually had 2 chances and yes they were both very true. Russian General Anatoly Kulikov claims that the USSR had at least two chances to eliminate Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, but Stalin opposed it, fearing that Nazi Germany could conclude a separate peace with the United States and Britain after his death.  Few people know of the decision taken by the leaders of the Soviet Union in 1941 to eliminate Hitler. Initially, it was decided to take place in Russia, when German troops attacked Moscow. Later, the plan to assassinate Hitler at its headquarters was conceived, but In 1943, Stalin made the surprising decision to cancel it, fearing that after Hitler's death, his entourage would not conclude a separate peace treaty with Britain and the United States from which the Soviet Union would be excluded. attests that negotiations for a (separate) peace treaty were indeed under way, the general said at a conference of historians organized by the military academy at the Russian Army General Staff.  **Picture of General Anatoly Kulikov** Kulikov said the second opportunity to eliminate Hitler was in 1944. \"I came up with a detailed plan for the operation, followed once again by Stalin's refusal. It was a shame because a person had been specially trained for this operation, it was a man who had been deliberately taken prisoner by the Nazis and who was happy. This coup had every chance of succeeding, \"the general said at a\" Lesser-known pages about Victory \"conference in Moscow. ",

            "answer_text": "No. To all the answers otherwise lets have some evidence. One mans claims with no other evidence is.. not a lot. Ww2 is probably the most covered subject in history. Second, Stalin was never on the front lines nor was Hitler; so no one was actually literally aiming at eachother. If youre asking if the Soviets had plans for an assasination that they never put into action thats different. Since Stalin famously sent several assasains after Tito, I wouldnt be surprised they had plans to try to get Hitler and never launched them. Was Hitler spared? Almost certainly not. I do not count plans hatched in offices and never undertaken; whether the plans come from Moscow, Washington DC, London, wherever. Speaking of which the British had Operation Foxley -which does have a lot of proof of its existence btw - and didnt undertake it, in part (not solely) because at that late stage the British felt Hitler was doing the Germans more harm than good; and his death would provide the Nazis a martyr. Hitler famously claimed he had an oil painting of Britians most decorated ww1 Tommy in his Obersalzburg sitting room. (One of them) He claimed that the soldier had Hitler in his sights but Hitler was unarmed and didnt shoot him The sources for this story are there but are relatively few in number; if it did happen most historians are sure Hitler was lying and they dont know why lied except to be dramatic. Hitler may not have been lying, the Tommy was in the same exact area as Hitler on that day. However its still felt this episode simply didnt occur. ",
