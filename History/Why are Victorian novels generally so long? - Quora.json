            "answer_text": "People prior to the early to mid-20th century wrote longer novels because they weren\u2019t afraid of words and reading. Shorter novels were also in existence, but for the most part, a long novel (long by our standards) was relatively normal. The average length today is around 250\u2013300 pages in a 6 x 9 format. In the Victorian era, the average length back then would be about 500 to 700 pages in the same format. I believe Gutenberg has some stats on this. And this is why most traditional publishers today will still publish novels between 100 and 700 pages. Writers typically wrote for longer periods of time while they waited to get responses from publishers for their book proposals which were more a thing back then (snail mail). Also, people read books to a far greater degree than we do now in terms of consumption by the population in the developed world, even with the greater illiteracy and higher cost of books back then. And if you were paying a lot of money for books, you wanted more story. So a longer book then was more entertainment for the consumer. And it could be years before the audience received another novel from their favorite writers (no self-publishing for for authors unless they were part of a publishing firm). Serializations adapted into novels weren\u2019t long because they were repetitive or took up page count. An editor could have reduced the pages quite easily. They were long because they were fluffed up on purpose to give the illusion of volume. Again, publishers wanted you to get a lot for your money. It was an entirely different attitude in the age before TL;DR. In fact, most of those serializations were developed and lengthened from full novels, not vice versa, even if those novels hadn\u2019t been published in full form yet. The serializations were more popular with people who couldn\u2019t afford books or were not good at reading. Though, the Victorian era would see a greater increase in literacy rates than any previous generations. None of this was easy for writer, publisher, or book seller. Took a lot of time to write and edit by pen and ink. Took a lot of time to typeset novels and paper and materials were very pricey. Took a lot of time, labor, and money to ship books to market and a lot of space to store them. This is kind of where print-on-demand got its start, but instead of being available to the consumer, book stores could indicate to a publisher how many volumes of any item they wanted to buy off of their seasonal catalog and publishers would then print up the necessary numbers according to pre-orders rather than wasting money on books that wouldn\u2019t be sold. When the price of paper and production came down, that is when publishers first began printing long print-runs as a default, in expectation of a certain number of sales each new book season - generally in spring (for the vacations) and fall (for school and the holidays). So for the most part, longer novels were in vogue in the early 1800s, then experienced a period where for various reasons publishers tried to cut down on length of novels to make them more commercially viable, and then they made a sort of comeback at the end of the century as literacy rates started to rise. That would last at least into the first part of the 20th century. However, not just a demand for shorter novels, but advancements in typesetting, increasing access to typewriters, layout, and font styles also contributed to a shrinkage in page count per novel.

            "answer_text": "Many Victorian novels are long because they were originally published in serialized form in magazines. They tend to be somewhat overwritten and sometimes contain redundancies because of the need to allow readers to pick up a magazine containing serial excerpt #3 or #5 or whatever, and still be able to follow the story.
