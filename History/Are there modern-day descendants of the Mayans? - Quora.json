            "answer_text": "Yes. Here in Yucat\u00e1n, even some of the old Zih\u00f3 noble families still have known descendants. Some of them even have power as local 'caciques'. Also, mayan surnames are very common. As for the serfs, I have an acquaintance that is a direct descendant of Cecilio Ch\u00ed, Jacinto Canek's second in command. Jacinto Canek's revolution against the white upper class is very famous, and is called la guerra de castas. Another famous person of pure Maya ancestry is Dr. Francisco Luna Kan. He was the first native-american governor of a Mexican state. The problem sometimes in trying to trace such ancestry:First, the Conquistadores changed some surnames and naming conventions.Second, that most people are mestizo, particularly with an influx of asians to work in the haciendas.Third, racism makes most people try to hide such ancestry. But yes, practically everybody in the Yucat\u00e1n Pen\u00ednsula, Guatemala and Belize, has some Maya Ancestry. ",

            "answer_text": "My husband is from guatemala; his family still lives there.  My brother-in-law and I discussed this question during one of our visits 1999. He is well versed in his country's traditions and heritage, and he states that there is no such thing as \"Mayan\" existing today, that Mayan referred to a citizen of the Mayan state just as someone who is a citizen of the USA is referred to as \"American\" regardless of race or ethnic heritage.  There were, he says, many groups within that state, each with their own traditions and languages.  Therefore, the indigenous people remaining today are \"Mayan\" in the sense that they are descended from citizens of the original Mayan state.  Obviously there is no \"Mayan\" language, either, as was well explained by Mr. Quinn above.  As to how many different languages are spoken by the indigenous people of Guatemala, I have read fiures ranging from 16 to nearly 30; this seems to depend on whether the author of any given article is referring only to distinct languages or languages + dialects. There was, in 1999, quite a political row going on because there was a group pushing for an official native  language and of course each group wanted its language to be the chosen one.  I do believe that idea died on the vine.  It should be noted, too, that the indigenous people vary widely in physical characteristics; it isn't always obvious who is or is not indigenous. ",

            "answer_text": "The modern words \"Maya\" and \"Mayan\" refer to a language family, and its associated ethnicities and cultures. This word was originally much more specific to an area of the Yucatan; there's no evidence that any Mayan language had an equivalent word. There are 27 living Mayan dialects; 22 in Guatemala, and 10 in Mexico (including 5 which cross the border). The famous classic Mayan sites use similar languages in their inscriptions; it's theorized that this was a priestly prestige language, similar to church Latin in middle ages Europe. The closest surviving language is Ch'orti, with only a few hundred speakers. But the common people probably spoke a language closer to Yucatec (also sometimes called just Maya), which has nearly a million speakers (second only to K'iche', a highland dialect with over 2 million speakers in areas near Quetzaltenango, Guatemala). All told, probably around 10-15 million people alive today have principally Mayan ancestry: about 70% of them born in Guatemala, about 20% in Mexico, about 5% in Belize, a handful in Honduras or El Salvador, and some number born to emigrants.
