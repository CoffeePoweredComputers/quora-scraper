            "answer_text": "In the words of the Nobel Prize Winner Henry Kissinger, when relaying orders for a bombing campaign on Cambodia to General Alexander Haig, in a phone call on December 9th 1970, \u201c(Nixon) wants a massive bombing campaign in Cambodia. He doesn\u2019t want to hear anything about it. It\u2019s an order, to be done. Anything that flies, on anything that moves.\u201d The force of the munitions used in the bombings amounted to 5 times that of the atomic blast on Hiroshima, and this undoubtedly ravaged the Cambodian countryside. The shock, awe and chaos created on a grand scale as a result of these bombings on Cambodia, allowed for the rise of Pol Pot, and contributed to the Khmer Rouge\u2019s ability to easily manipulate or control the already decimated populace, forcing many of them into labor camps in the rural countryside. It estimated that his regime would lead to the demise of at least 1.6 million people, or what would\u2019ve almost made up nearly a quarter of the country\u2019s population, at or around that time. A former Khmer Rouge official named Chitt Do, from Angkor Wat, was interviewed in 1979 by an Australian journalist named Bruce Palling, and here\u2019s just a little bit of what Chitt had to say, in response to the journalist asking, whether the Khmer Rogue had exploited the bombing campaigns with the intent of furthering their own propaganda. \u201cOh yes, they did. Every time after there had been bombing, they would take the people to see the craters, to see how big and deep the craters were, to see how the earth had been gouged out and scorched\u2026 The ordinary people... sometimes literally shit in their pants when the big bombs and shells came... Their minds just froze up and they would wander around mute for three or four days. Terrified and half-crazy, the people were ready to believe what they were told... That was what made it so easy for the Khmer Rouge to win the people over... It was because of their dissatisfaction with the bombing that they kept on cooperating with the Khmer Rouge, joining up with the Khmer Rouge, sending their children off to go with them\u201d. There are actually a lot of sad lines uttered, with often a lot of fucked up history behind them, that can be attributed to ol\u2019 Henry Kissinger. I think in the end, one of his more important quotes, which I believe describes the man deep down, was quoted by the New York Times, on October 28th 1973: \u201cPower is the ultimate aphrodisiac\u201d.

            "answer_text": "[1] Heinrich Ehrler, a Luftwaffe ace, was flying a mission to shoot down Allied bombers. He had shot down quite a few, but then he ran out of ammunition. His last radio transmission was to Theodore Weissenberger, another Luftwaffe ace, saying, \u201cTheo, I\u2019ve run out of ammunition. I\u2019m going to ram this one. Goodbye, we\u2019ll see each other in Valhalla.\u201d Then he rammed into the American bomber, ending his life. His background story was also a sad one. He joined the army in 1935 as an anti-aircraft gunner in the Spanish Civil War. He then joined the airforce in WWII and had a lot of victories in the Eastern Front. Later, he was blamed for the sinking of the KMS Tirpitz from an RAF air raid. Before this, he was nominated for the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords but was never awarded it because of the sinking of the Tirpitz. He was even court-martialed and stripped of his position, even put under house-arrest. Later, he was called back into service because Germany was desperately in need of experienced pilots. Heinrich Ehrler gladly took the job. Then near the end of the war, he rammed into the American Bomber.
