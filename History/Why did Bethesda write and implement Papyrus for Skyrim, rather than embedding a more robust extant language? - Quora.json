            "answer_text": "Unlike other major game engines, such as the Unreal Engine, CryEngine, or Source, Bethesda has never sought to turn the Creation Engine or its predecessors into a secondary revenue stream by licensing it out to other developers. (Obsidian's work on Fallout: New Vegas was a special case; while they were an outside developer, they were specifically contracted to make a title in one of Bethesda's franchises.) Because of this, there seems to be a clear historical track record: any new functionality included in their latest edition of their internal Construction Set/Creation Kit, to include features of the scripting language, was placed there to support a planned feature of their latest game or DLC expansion. They make a tool that's \"just barely enough\" to make the game that they want. From an outsider's perspective, it would appear whoever allocates budget and developer hours for improving the Engine & Scripting views developer niceties as expense items to be justified, instead of an infrastructure investment for the good of the tool set itself, and by extension, the overall project. So, if this trend continues, the only way we're going to see Dynamically Sized Arrays or Unit Testing added to the scripting language is if Fallout 4 or Elder Scrolls 5 try to implement features complex enough to require them. While this might seem to be depressing news at first, because \"dynamic arrays\" isn't exactly the kind of thing the marketing wonks can put as a bullet point on the back of the box, there's still hope. From what I've heard of modders who have analyzed Skyrim's Civil War quest-line, it was originally planned to be much more expansive, but shortcomings in Papyrus meant that the final product had to be severely scaled back. One would hope that the scripters who couldn't realize the expansive vision asked of them are reminding the bean counters of this failure when they lobby for scripting language upgrades next time around.  (Though I also suspect that after two and a half decades, their practice of making dev tools that are \"just barely enough\" and then tossing them out to the community to see what happens has become something of a de facto \"Excalibur Test\" for Bethesda. The modder who came up with the original script extender for Morrowind, to be able to write the mod Morrowind Combat Enhanced, ended up getting hired by Bethesda to develop Oblivion's combat. This pattern has been repeated a few times since then.) ",

            "answer_text": "As Paul Gettle said, I agree that Bethesda took the route to accomplish what they sought to be necessary for their product. Not what is necessary for additional developers or for selling the development tools to 3rd parties.  However, sorry for advertising but, there are other ways of creating scripts for skyrim. For instance, a project I created over a year ago called PapyrusDotNet, you will find it at zerratar/PapyrusDotNetits a project that enables you to compile C# code into Papyrus, so basically. Instead of writing your Skyrim mods using Papyrus, you can now use C# instead :-) This makes it easier for people that is already used with Visual Studio + C# to get started writing scripts for Skyrim ;-) It has been a while since I updated the project, but it still works as expected.
