            "answer_text": " Definitely a big YES!!! Ipl has just started and teams have only played 3\u20134 matches. We can't rule out any teams at this stage. It's true that CSK is struggling a bit.But there is enough time left for them to make a comeback. From yesterday's match vs SRH there were many positives.Dhoni spend some time in middle yesterday.He faced around 30+ balls and that's pretty good.Even though he failed to get CSK cross the line, he spend some time batting and that will do good for the team for upcoming matches.  What went wrong for Dhoni was he was trying to hit the ball so hard yesterday.He mistimed so many shots. In the post match presentation he told that he was subconsciously hitting the ball so hard because of the big ground. The temperature yesterday played a big role in Dhoni's innings.He kept wickets for 20 overs and came to bat, ran singles and doubles and eventually got drained out. Inclusion of Rayudu and Bravo is also a good sign. I personally believe Sam Curran should bat higher.He can anchor the team with impressive strike rate in the middle overs. If Jadhav is in playing eleven( reason I don't know), then he should bat number 7. They lost by only 7 runs in the end. So adjusting the team balance a bit can get CSK back into winning track. My probable eleven for CSK will be Watson Rayudu Duplessi Sam Curran Dhoni Jadeja Jadhav(or someone else) Bravo Thakur Chawla/ Karn Sharma Deepak Chahar Edit: CSK vs KXIP CSK won by 10 wickets See, everything went right for CSK in this match.The openers fired up.They single handedly chased down the target.Good bowling and fielding performance too. What's most impressive was they scored very good amount of runs in powerplay and first 10 overs. So they were able to play freely afterwards. Well played CSK\ud83d\udd25 ",

            "answer_text": "before I say anything let me tell u that I am a CSK supporter from inaugrual season and a great fan of MS Dhoni from 2007 t20 World Cup. But this year Chennai team is struggling very badly. No doubt there is a lot of experience in the team. But Given the fact that most of the players who have not played cricket from a long long time and not Been in touch with the game is affecting the team. Most of the players are old and out of form. No combination seems to be working for the team this season. Fitness levels of players are down as they are old . Body parts coordination is less. Especially eye and head coordination. The worst hit player is Watson who's clueless in the middle. Kedar Jadhav is another player who's so clueless that he's not able to middle the ball . MS Dhoni is not able to finish games like before and looks unfit. They just have to accept the fact that they have fitness issues and lack of young talent. Lack of young talent in the team is a factor that is hurting the team this year. They have not been able to make use of power play with the bat nor with the ball. They are not able to reach 50 within 10 overs. The openers are consuming too many deliveries and putting pressure on the middle order. It's very tough to say that this team will qualify to the play offs this year. No Suresh Raina and the experienced Harbhajan Singh is another reason. Who can possibly replace them ? Raina is the main piller for the team from the start of the ipl. If so one of the openers got out soon he cud hold the innings tight and accelerate . They can be replaced only by an Indian because there are already 8 foreigners playing for the team. Manoj and Yusuf Patan are the only options . But even though either of them come in do they bring the same game as Raina had? undoubtedly no. For Harbhajan there's absolutely no one to replace his experience . Jadeja is completely out of form . If so they have an injured Foriegner they can go for the likes of David Malan or may be A Colin Munro or also they can go with Marnus Labuschagne or Tom Latham and even a Henrich Klaasen or an Evin Lewis or Shai Hope or even a Martin Guptill. But for Indians they have no good option. It's not something to be cool about for MS and Fleming. They have 10 games and have to win atleast 8 out of 10 to qualify for play offs which looks unlikely with the struggling side . Age issues , Out of form batsmen and bowlers(specially Spinners), Lack of young talent , Low Fitness levels, Loss of two experienced talents like Suresh Raina and Harbhajan Singh , etc \u2026. are leading to failure as a unit for the team. Hence they are unlikely to qualify for the play offs this year. ",

            "answer_text": "No, I dont think so. Though I am a MI fan, but I believe CSK wont make it to the play offs this time. I will provide my understanding as to why. KXIP are almost ruled out of IPL since they will end up max on 16 points if they win all their remaining 7 games, which is not possible in any case. They are certain to lose atleast 2 or 3 more matches from here, with the way they are playing and their current form. I am assuming they will end up with 12 points even with their best performance. RR and CSK\u2019s current performance is 3 games out of 8 games. Remember that Delhi, Mumbai and RCB are already on 12 and 10 Points respectively with equal number of games played. Even if they both win 3 games out of their remaining 7 games, they end up on 18 and 16 points, sufficient to enter the play offs. And lets not forget that their NRR is also near to +1. Infact MI have the best NRR with +1.33. I believe 1st, 2nd and 3rd position will be occupied by DC, MI and RCB only assuming they end up on 18, 16 and 16 from here (They can even win more games and end up on 20, 18, 16 or 22,20, 18..anything can happen!) For CSK to even dream about 4th place, they will need to win 7 games, which means any 4 out of their remaining 6 matches. They have to play DC, MI and RCB as well, which wont be easy as such since these 3 teams, by far, have dominated IPL 2020. Dont forget they KKR are 2 points ahead of CSK and are also in the hunt still. The Statistics is simple for CSK-1- Win all of at the most 5 of their remaining 6 games (to end on 18 or 16 points) to safely qualify without depending on other teams. 2- Hope that SRH, KKR and RR lose majority of their remaining games and somehow end up max at 14 points. (All teams should win max 3 out of their 7 games to end below CSK\u2019s max points of 16 if they win out of their 6 games) ",

Virat Kohli-led Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB0 crushed CSK by 37 runs in their seventh game of the season on Saturday. Kohli won the toss and opted to bat first in Dubai. His decision seemed to have backfired when both Aaron Finch (2) and AB de Villiers (0) were removed cheaply but Kohli led from the front and played a captain's knock of unbeaten 90 off just 52 deliveries to help his side post a challenging total of 169 runs on the board. In reply, CSK batting line-up left it too late to accelerate once again as they were restricted on 132/8 after a combined effort from the RCB bowlers. It was yet another disappointing show from the CSK batting line-up which has consistently failed to fire in chases this season. After CSK's 5th loss of the season, fans once again turned to social media to request Suresh Raina to return. Raina, the vice-captain of the side and the leading run-getter of CSK in IPL, had pulled out of the tournament ahead of the start of the new season. He is currently with his family in India. Fans once again pleaded to the left-handed batsman to make a comeback as his presence is clearly being felt by the Dhoni-led side.   \n ",

            "answer_text": "Well answering this question is kind of tough. As we know CSK is the most experienced and aged side in the tournament, there is certainly a big confusion regarding their team. As far as we got to know from the first 4 matches, its clear that the team lacks valuable young assets. Players like Murali Vijay, Ms Dhoni, Suresh Raina, Shane watson and Harbhajan have played their last t20 match of a year gap. Even bowlers like Deepak and piyush are finding it hard to back their form. Finally CSK have sam Curran and Faf having recent international exposure. Considering this on one hand and looking at Emirate pitch conditions which are almost dry and hot, manifestation can be bought up that spin Department needs quality having jadeja, chawla and tahir. But tahir can be effective in the pitches still no place in the squad for him. Only Effective solution for CSK qualification can be Shane watson needs to be in form, because his batting has set high standard in the unit. Secondly try Reordering Sam Curran batting order can be a crucial moment for CSK. I guess likes of kedar jadhav and Murali Vijay should be rested for the future matches considering the team needs. People may say jadhav have a spin option, but the option is completely useless for CSK point of view since he is not a great turner of ball neither has a difference in variation. This can be tough call but including Hazzlewood can definitely better their performance, looking at his recent form in UK than including bravo. Right now CSK have no trump card list left, So only option is that present players needs to fire. I hope CSK auction next year should include more of young Player than aged one. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely Yes,. Given the fact they have the most experienced lineup. MS Dhoni would love to come back to his old ways, which will in turn make him most destructive batsmen. Being tagged as a team of senior statesmen, critics believed that CSK had got it completely wrong in the auctions. However, the senior lot has shown that there is no substitute for experience. Having been in tight situations and knowing what it takes to get over the line, Chennai have clinched crucial situations. Hence, they find themselves at the apex of the points table. And most Importantly,. MS Captaincy. In Chennai, they call MS Dhoni Thala, which means the leader. Dhoni has not only been a mere Captain but a real leader in the truest sense of the word. Be it marshalling his bowlers as per the match situation, picking up a balanced side or shuffling the batting order, the skipper has been on point with his decisions. Mahi has also mastered the art of controlling the pace of the game. He slows it down a little bit when his bowlers are going for runs. Also, he keeps pressure intact when the opposition is under the pump. And as far as bowling is concerned,. They have roped in J Hazlewood and P Chawla which will strengthen their bowling line up. CSK have managed to arrange their bowling pieces in manner such that they have all their bases covered. As far as their spin options are concerned, they have Imran Tahir and Puyish Chawla as leg spinners. This is very good for the balance of the side as you get a like-for-like replacement for Tahir. It allows them to play an extra overseas batsman. The pace battery comprises of Deepak Chahar and Shardul Thakur as leading Indian quicks. They have Shane Watson and Dwayne Bravo as all-rounders who are more than able bowlers. For additional pace, Chennai can look towards Lungi Ngidi and J Hazlewood who have the potential to unsettle the opposition batsmen. So, will history repeat itself? Have your say! ",

So at the end of the group league if the points are the same in the points table then teams will be going in the knockout stage on the basis of the net run rate.

Less productive overseas players considering current form.only sam curran seems superlative over others. 7. Over dependent on opening pair. ",
