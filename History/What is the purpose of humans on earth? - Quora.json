In heaven, all we have is truth, love and joy, there is no pain, suffering and fear. \"In the absence of that which You Are Not, that Which You Are, is NOT. \"In the absence of 'cold,' you cannot be 'warm.' In the absence of 'sad,' you cannot be 'happy,' without a thing called 'evil,' the experience you call 'good' cannot exist. Parable of The Little Soul .... by Neale Donald Walsch September 13, 2011 at 4:17pm There once was a little soul who knew itself to be the light. This was a new soul, and so, anxious for experience. \"I am the light,\" it said. \"I am the light.\" Yet all the knowing of it and all the saying of it could not substitute for the experience of it. And in the realm from which this soul emerged, there was nothing but the light. Every soul was grand, every soul was magnificent, and every soul shone with the brilliance of MY awesome light. And so the little soul in question was as a candle in the sun. In the midst of the grandest light- of which it was a part- it could not see itself, nor experience itself as Who and What it Really Is. Now it came to pass, that the little soul yearned and yearned to know itself. And so great was its yearning that \"I\" one day said, \"Do you know little one, what you must do to satisfy this yearning of yours?\" \"Oh what, God? what? I'll do anything!? The little soul said. \"You must separate yourself from the rest of us,\" I answered, \"and then you must call upon yourself the darkness.\" \"You may choose to be any Part of God you wish to be,\" I said to the little soul. \"You are the Absolute Divinity, experiencing Itself. What Aspect of Divinity do you now wish to experience as you?\" \"You mean I have a choice,\" ask the little soul. I answered, \"Yes.\" You may choose to experience any Aspect of Divinity in, as, and through you.\" \"Okay,\" said the little soul, then I choose forgiveness. I want to experience my Self as that Aspect of God called Complete Forgiveness.\" Well, this created a little challenge, as you can imagine. There was no one to forgive. All I have created is Perfection and Love \"No one to forgive?\" asked the Little Soul, somewhat incredulously. \"No one,\" I repeated. \"Look around you. Do you see any souls less perfect, less wonderful than you?\" As the Little soul twirled around, and was surprised to see himself surrounded by all the souls in heaven. They came from far and wide throughout the Kingdom, because they had heard the little soul was having an extraordinary conversation with God. \"I see none less perfect than I,\" the Little Soul exclaimed.\" Who then, shall I have to forgive?\" Just then another soul stepped forward from the crowd. \"You may forgive me,\" said the Friendly Soul. \"For what?\" the little soul asked. \"I will come onto your next physical lifetime and do something for you to forgive,\" replied the Friendly Soul. \"But what? What could you, a being of such Perfect Light, do to make me forgive you?\" the Little Soul wanted to know. \"Oh,\" smiled the Friendly Soul, I'm sure we can think of something.\" \"But why would you want to do this?\" The Little Soul could not figure out why a being of such perfection would want to slow down its vibration so much that it could actually do something \"bad.\" \"Simple,\" the Friendly Soul explained,\" I would do it because I love you. You want to experience your Self as Forgiving, don't you? Besides, you have done the same for me.\" \"I have?\" asked the Little Soul. \"Of course. Don't you remember? We've been All Of It, you and I. We've been the Up and the Down of it, and the Left and Right of it. We've been the Here and Now of it, and the Now and Then of it. We've been the Big and Small of it, the Male and Female of it, the Good and Bad of it. We've been the All of it. \"And we've done it by agreement, so that each of us might experience ourselves as The Grandest Part of God. For we have understood that..... \"In the absence of that which You Are Not, that Which You Are, is NOT. \"In the absence of 'cold,' you cannot be 'warm.' In the absence of 'sad,' you cannot be 'happy,' without a thing called 'evil,' the experience you call 'good' cannot exist. If you choose to be a thing, something or someone opposite to that has to show up somewhere in your universe to make that possible.\" The Friendly Soul then explained that those people are God's Special Angels, and these conditions God's Gifts. \"I ask only one thing in return, \" the Friendly Soul declared. \"Anything! Anything,\" the Little Soul cried. He was excited now to know that he could experience every Divine Aspect of God. He understood, now The Plan. \"In the moment that I strike you and smite you,\" said the Friendly Soul, \" in the moment that I do the worst to you that you could ever imagine---in that self-same moment....remember Who I Really Am.\" \"Oh, I won't forget!\" promised the Little Soul. \"I will see you in the perfection with which I hold you now, and I will remember Who You Are, always.\" \"What is this darkness, O' Holy One?\" the little soul ask. \"That which you are not,\" I replied, and the soul understood. So this the soul did, removing itself from the All, yea, going even onto another realm. And in this realm the soul had the power to call onto its experience all sorts of darkness. And this it did. Yet in the midst of all the darkness did it cry out: \"Father, Father, why hast Thou forsaken me?\" Even as have you in your blackest times. Yet I have never forsaken you, but stand by you always, ready to remind you of Who You Really Are; ready, always ready, to call you home. Therefore, be a light unto the darkness, and curse it not. And forget not Who You Are in the moment of your encirclement by that which you are not. But do you praise to the creation, even as you seek to change it. And know that what you do in the time of your greatest trial can be your greatest triumph. For the experience you create is a statement of Who You Are..... and Who You Want To Be.... Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife by Eben Alexander III M.D. Heaven is for Real: A Little Boy's Astounding Story of His Trip to Heaven and Back by Todd Burpo . Conversations with God: An Uncommon Dialogue by Neale Donald Walsch. The Origin Speaks by Guy Steven Needler. Most humans on Earth are unaware that we are eternal beings. Only a small part of our true being is projected into the physical body, which is simply a vehicle that allows us to experience life at the lower levels of our multiverse. Thanks to Guy Needler\u2019s pioneering work, our role here is becoming clearer. What is our True Energetic Self? I believe it when I see it? Most people believe they are their body, their ego and/or their soul. But we are much more than all those put together. The problem is that when we occupy a human body, we lose most of our connection with our True Energetic Self, which is who we really are. \u201cIt would be as if your little toe forgot that it was part of the body. But the rest of your body knows that the toe is part of it.\u201d \u2013 Wendy Kennedy (Nomar) It\u2019s like going from having 5 million channels in our true energetic form to only 5 channels (our senses) in our physical form on Earth. Humans only see about 25% of what\u2019s actually there in the physical universe. Our physical eyes cannot see any of the higher energetic universes within the multiverse.We can\u2019t rely on our limited eyes or devices to measure what exists beyond our reality.How were we created? The Origin (Absolute/The All) is a vast tract of amorphous space called the omniverse. It doesn\u2019t know how big it is or what all it can be. To investigate itself, the Origin split itself into 12 Source Entities, which are smaller units of the Origin. One of the Source Entities (SE1) became our creator (\u201cGod\u201d). SE1 created the structure of our multiverse and the entities to populate it.Our Source expanded itself by creating countless smaller versions or individualized sentient units of itself, one of which represents our True Energetic Self (TES).The True Energetic Self has been called by many names: Oversoul, Monad, Godhead, Supersoul, Higher Self, etc. That much bigger being is who we truly are.Our TES can choose to experience all or part or none of the multiverse.Most TES\u2019s (88%) remain disincarnate in the energetic side. But some (only 12%) choose to incarnate in the physical universe to experience the lowest frequencies there and all the higher frequencies in the purely energetic parts of the multiverse (see Where Do Human and Other Souls Come From? \u2013 Big Picture Questions.com). What is our True Energetic Self? The TES can project one or more (maximum of 12) soul aspects of itself anywhere in the multiverse (see below). They tend to be projected to the physical universe or bottom of the multiverse, where we can learn and evolve faster. Why? Because it\u2019s harder to exist in the lower frequencies.  These soul aspects can occupy a human form or another form (alien/other \u201cformless\u201d entities) to experience a particular environment as a living being. Generally, our souls do not incarnate into lower forms, such as animals, plants or minerals, because they don\u2019t offer the same range of experiences that we can have in human or higher forms.Needler said the TES keeps 70% of its total sentient energies within itself (discarnate). But the other 30% can be projected outside of the TES as souls, that incarnate in the physical universe OR are working elsewhere in the multiverse structure.Each soul/aspect can also expand itself by projecting up to 12 shards or smaller fragments of itself to have additional lifetimes as well.Therefore, the TES could experience up to 144 lives concurrently, but that doesn\u2019t happen. Why? Because our soul uses another energetic function called \u201cevent space\u201d or parallel environments. In each lifetime, our soul has numerous parallel lives that contribute to its overall experiences that allow it to evolve faster. How does it work? Here is a diagram I prepared to summarize our how Source Entity and True Energetic Self (TES) work together to investigate the unmapped parts of the Origin (click to enlarge). The TES has projected four aspects (labeled Aspect 1-4) into the physical universe.Aspect 2 has projected five shards of itself to explore things in more detail. The shards occupy physical bodies in different locations and frequencies.The \u201cstand-alone shards\u201d have more energy content, while the \u201cfractional shards\u201d have less energy content. The bottom of the diagram shows numerous parallel lives that occur in event space, which is used to figure out all possible \u201cwhat if scenarios\u201d at every choice point to learn the cause and effect of things. Final Comment This is new information being given to us by Source at this time, because we\u2019re ready to understand it now. Don\u2019t be the little toe that forgot it\u2019s part of a much bigger eternal being, which is a true replicate of our Source Entity. Our True Energetic Self is an amazing creator being in training, organizing our lives at various levels to coordinate our experiences and evolution with numerous other beings in the multiverse. \u201cSome say the real masters are on this physical level, because you\u2019re the ones having to figure out how to do this [free will] the first time. When you come out on the other side, it\u2019s going to impact the entire universe.\u201d \u2013 Wendy Kennedy What Is Our True Energetic Self? - Big Picture Questions.com The Origin has mapped less than a tenth of 1% of its current area of focus (or area of polyomniscient sentient self-awareness). There\u2019s a long way to go for all evolving entities that are part of expanding the sentience of the Origin/The All. The Origin needs all the TESs to be promoted as Source Entities in the future. Our ultimate goal is to be God, Source Entity. Too good to be true? Maybe not. ",

            "answer_text": "Why are we here? This question is similar to questions like: Does Life Have Meaning?Why Do We Exist?What \tIs Our Purpose?Is Happiness Even the Point?These are questions that are difficult to answer with a simple one page answer. These questions are best talked about with a give and take interaction. I do not know how important the final answer is for you? But, I am assuming that the answer is very important and if they are important then you will be going on a journey. You journey may include reading similar questions on Quora or searching the internet and reading as much as possible. NO ONE will be able to give you a perfect and completely suited answer for your particular purpose. But, from all the information you collect, you will be building up a collection of memories that will, hopefully, lead you to YOUR ANSWER. We all, individually, must find our own purpose in life. The farther we peer into space, the more we realize that the secret of life and existence can't be found by inspecting spiral galaxies or watching distant supernovas. It lies deeper. It involves our very selves. We're more than we've been taught in biology class. We're not just a collection of atoms that make up proteins and molecules. Everything you see and experience (the \u201cself\u201d), your body, the trees and sky, are part of an active process occurring in your mind, your consciousness. You're not an object: you're your consciousness. The answer to life and the universe can't be found by looking through a telescope or examining the finches of the Galapagos. It lies much deeper. Our consciousness is why they exist. Why the existence of objects? Why of everything? Even if there are no humans to think about it, why is there existence? We and everything else existed long before we could even torture ourselves with such a question. The problem obviously came with the appearance of self-consciousness. The ability to be aware and to know that you exist. Maybe from human perspective, we are created to live, to develop, to experience everything that our brains allow us, to exist! We should be able to leave the world better than we have entered it. To answer any of these questions, you must follow your own inner voice. You must learn as much as you can about all of these questions, then and only then, will your inner voice, your subconscious, your inner self, present a solution that is YOUR SOLUTION! You may not be truly happy with your answer but it will be your answer. Someone else can not give you the answers, but they can help you learn your answer. Good hunting! ",
