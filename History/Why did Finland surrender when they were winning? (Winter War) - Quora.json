            "answer_text": "Finland didn\u2019t surrender, nor were they winning by the time the Moscow Peace Treaty was signed in 1940. While they indeed fought tenaciously during the Winter War (1939\u20131940), they were on the fence and very close to losing huge amounts of territory in a new Soviet offensive. Yet, with a combination of good timing and sheer luck, they were able to achieve their main objectives: holding off the Soviet invasion to that point and maintaining their sovereignty. To end the conflict, Finland was forced to cede 11% of its territory to the Soviets.  Finnish territory ceded to the USSR, 1940 The Finns reacquired these territories during Continuation War alongside the German invasion of the USSR (1941\u201342), only to lose them again by signing the Moscow Armistice in September 1944, which restored the provisions of the 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty.  Soviet advances in April, 1945 All in all, Finland was extremely lucky to walk away from both that conflict and the Second World War relatively unscathed and not as a newly acquired province of the Soviet Union.

            "answer_text": "Maybe reading this loosely translated article will give you some answers: This is a long and loosely translated article about the Winter War, written by a Finn, Professor Kimmo Rentola. He has gathered a lot of news from the world and put some serious thought into the Winter War and why Stalin suddenly was open for peace discussions. It is thought-provoking to say the least. While the Allies hugely exaggerated their help to Finland and their plans - a paranoid Stalin bought the unintended disinformation, freaked out and hurried to end the war in order to save his face. However, this is worth reading, because it presents how the Allies could have helped Finland had they wanted to: By Kimmo Rentola How the intelligence agencies impacted on Stalin\u2019s decisions about the Winter War During the beginning of the second week in Winter War, a Russian torpedo boat called Razvedt\u0161ik ('Scout') drove to rocks in Lake Ladoga due to Finnish artillery fire. That is when Stalin started to realize that his intelligence had actually gone to the rocks: instead of minor border battles and occupation, he was now faced with a full-scale war. Finland fought back fiercely and his puppet government in Terijoki was not supported in Finland. Moscow didn\u2019t grasp the situation at first, instead Marshal Voro\u0161ilov ordered the 9th Division to \u201cproceed faster\u201d towards Oulu. Stalin was handed reports from the secret police NKVD starting from 12th December that revealed how serious the problems were and how huge were the losses. Stalin created seven new NKVD special units (1.500 men in each unit) to monitor the Red Army\u2019s back. Finns knew about Red Army\u2019s preparations, but didn\u2019t at first grasp how huge they were - or that Stalin would even attack. Russians again thought the Finnish \u2018ordeal\u2019 would resemble the easy occupation of Eastern Poland. Russians crossed the border to Finland with a marching band in the front and with the order not to cross the border to Sweden. By River Tornionjoki Russians were ordered to salute Swedish soldiers, but not to talk with them. Stalin\u2019s birthday came and went without the promised birthday gift, Finland. After that Stalin and Voro\u0161ilov advised the commanders on the front that \u201cthe war in Finland is serious, drastically differing from our autumn picnic in Poland\u201d. The Winter War had lasted one month by then. *** Finns figured out right away that the Finnish communists had promised Moscow that the Finnish working class would take up arms and fight beside the Red Army. The Red Army always carried a puppet government when attacking. But Stalin found out quickly that the Finnish puppet government (Kuusinen) had no impact on the actual decisions. *** What went wrong in Moscow? Why did Stalin make such grave miscalculations? You have to read the reports that NKVD submitted to Stalin on a daily basis. secret cables from different countries.reports about foreign embassies\u2019 activities in Moscow.reports from Leningrad, Petrozavodsk, and other parts of Soviet Union.NKVD:s special units\u2019 reports about the military and the war ministry\u2019s activities.Decision about War Before attacking Stalin was concerned with: how the international world would react.ensuring that Finland is left alone when the Red Army attacks.that Hitler keeps his promise and leaves Finland to fight alone.what the Western allies and Sweden would do if the attack against Finland is prolonged.*** He was not concerned with Finland\u2019s internal situation and military readiness. Yet he wanted to know if Finns will surrender and if they won\u2019t, were there any cracks to take advantage of. The secret cables of the British diplomats from the three Baltic countries as well as from Helsinki were available for Stalin to read nearly simultaneously as for the Foreign Office. British Embassy in Helsinki reported about the atmosphere: \u201cIf the Soviet Union demands territory from Finland, Finns are unable to resist because they are not in the shape to wage war against Soviet Union.\u201d\u201cMarshal Mannerheim asked us to deliver his personal opinion to His Majesty\u2019s Government in strictest confidence, according to which he believed Finland has to give in and hand over bases and airfields of the archipelago to the U.S.S.R.\u201d \u2026 This top secret personal opinion was on Stalin\u2019s desk immediately.British secret cables also revealed the attitude of the West. As the Finnish delegation was invited to Moscow, neither Brits nor Americans could offer any advice to the panicked Finns.Sweden only offered moral support.Brits knew, that the Finnish commander was very disappointed when Germany turned it\u2019s back on Finland.Himmler told the Finnish commander: \u201cStay strong if you want to, but we are not going to help you.\u201d*** Russian intelligence reported about what the Japanese military attach\u00e9 said when finding out about Germany\u2019s attitude. Colonel Doi could not comprehend why Moscow was given free hands in Finland. Military attach\u00e9s were stunningly talkative, especially Sweden\u2019s Major Birger Vrang. He told how the Finnish government didn\u2019t initially believe in the British information of how the Red Army had 33 divisions on Finland\u2019s border, like the Finnish Attach\u00e9 Somerto had said to him: \u201cThere can\u2019t possibly be that much weaponry in the wilderness. Russians will not attack , because it would destroy their peace propaganda\u201d.Somerto: \u201cSwedes keep on repeating that Stalin can\u2019t possibly attack Finland, because it is part of Scandinavia, but they say nothing about offering help.\u201dSwedish Vrang assured Russians, that Sweden will not help Finland. Vrang estimated the war to last for six months and that Finns would retreat towards the Swedish border.Vrang probably encouraged Stalin to cut Finland in half in Oulu. Stalin and Voro\u0161ilov had adviced the Russian commanders to learn about their experiences in 1808\u201309. They got surrounded there then too, so Russians knew about the danger of being surrounded in Finland. *** Prior to the attack Soviet spies and agents were sent to Finland to create a network and prepare for the upcoming occupation of Finland. Both GRU and NKVD assigned new residents to Helsinki; Ivan Smirnov and Jelisei T. Sinitsy. They arrived only three weeks before the attack and didn\u2019t have enough time to put up their networks or to get a deeper understanding about the situation. Sinitsy wrote in his memoirs, that he had warned Stalin about Finns\u2019 fighting spirit and defence, but his reports were never published. Instead his reports told about how poor the Finnish army was, how dissatisfied the soldiers were, how Finland did not have a financial base for warfare and how Finns were afraid of a war. This is how Kreml viewed their chances. But things don\u2019t always go the way you want. Decision about Peace The nature of the attack hardened Finns to fight back. A big one attacking a small one, a border provocation, bombing civilian targets and workers\u2019 neighborhoods, Kuusinen\u2019s puppet government. It was definitely not about a few islands and a border altercation: it was about life and death. Mannerheim grabbed the Marshal\u2019s wand, pacifist Tanner emerged as the most determined man in the government, workers and farmers - who were used to do work outdoors - did whatever they could on the fronts, even communists fought beside them. The Soviet intelligence had picked up military attach\u00e9 Somerto\u2019s words three weeks before the attack: \u201cThe people in our country support the government, so it will not go like it went in Poland, where different parties pull in different directions\u201dFinland\u2019s resistance and victories on the frontier snatched the advantage Stalin wanted most: a quick success. Now he had to wage war in bad conditions, as an international pariah, the spitting cup of all democratic forces, and what was worst: getting the reputation as an incapable War Lord. Now Stalin had to be scared about what Germany and the West would do with more time to think about their moves. Things weren\u2019t good on his home front either. The one-way official publication gave room for rumours and hearsay, which was much more credible. And the word was already spreading. *** At the beginning of the war, a Russian newspaper for railroad workers Gudokin ('Whistle') sent an eager young reporter to Terijoki (where the puppet government was told to be). The reporter looked around and rushed back to Leningrad to make a call to the head quarters in Moscow: \u201cThere is no Finnish government or even one single minister from Kuusinen\u2019s government in Terijoki, and there never has been one. Kuusinen\u2019s government exists on paper only and our troops suffer horrible losses.\u201dThe reporter was immediately handed over to the government and his story was never published. He disappeared. *** The only good news came from Germany. Americans had good intentions. NKVD overheard American diplomat Charles Bohlen\u2019s draft of a compromise: Kuusinen would resign and Paasikivi would lead the government.That way Russians wouldn\u2019t lose their faces, because Finland would replace their government with the \u2018people\u2019s government\u2019.Americans thought they knew what kind of government suits different nations.Helping Finland was a strong case in Britain and France, even in Sweden when the Winter War started. British military intelligence documents shed light on some things, for example documents concerning General C. G. Ling\u2019s reports from two trips to Mikkeli, ordered by Sir Edmund Ironside. There is a long discussion with Mannerheim on 8th January in 1940, where Mannerheim believed Finns could last until May, in spite of the Red Army\u2019s new upcoming full-scale attack. The Red Army could be beaten if Finland got planes, ammunition, artillery and especially 76.2 mm it-cannons. Then the miracle may happen that Finland is victorious. Mannerheim also planned a foreign legion of 30.000 soldiers, he smiled and referred to how Italy and Germany didn\u2019t intervene in the Spanish Civil War. He did not want to see regular British or Frensh troops on Finland\u2019s soil, because he was concerned how Germany would react. Mannerheim clearly avoided a situation where Sweden and Finland would be allies against both Germany and Soviet Union. He encouraged the Allies to attack Soviet Union from other places: \u201cImagine that you make a move from Caucasus? It should be easy for General Weygand\u2019s Army.Occupying Baku would be a fatal blow for both Germany and Soviet Union.Instead of Petsamo I suggest Murmansk or Arkhangelsk. The Brits have always been superb in those kind of expeditions.\u201dSoviet intelligence intercepted all details from the Western Allies and forwarded them to Stalin, but only from Paris, not from London anymore. NKVD\u2019s London rezidentura \u2013 the Cambridge Five - came under Stalin\u2019s suspicion during those times. Their material was so good, that Stalin suspected it was fed to him. Did the Brits try to provoke him to make false moves and create a rift between him and Hitler? Stalin had every reason to suspect he was fed disinformation. During the autumn London\u2019s rezidentura had reported about Mannerheim\u2019s and his close circle\u2019s pessimism, fear and defeatism. Yet now Mannerheim\u2019s soldiers left a horrifying imprint while they annhiliated the Red Army\u2019s ranks. Had the deceitful Brits lured Stalin into a trap? He didn\u2019t care about the loss of manpower - once Stalin spewed out about his North-Korean Allies: \u201c What are they complaining about, they didn\u2019t lose anything except men?!\u201dStalin didn\u2019t care about the soldiers, but he sure cared about losing Soviet Union\u2019s military reputation, being more and more isolated and the destruction of his political chances to ally. *** Stalin was also concerned about the inner impact Winter War had in Soviet Union. His attempt to cut Finland in half in Oulu led to one of Red Army\u2019s worst catastrophe. Stalin learned about the destiny of the 44th Division on Raate road from a Finnish report from the frontier that was translated to him. The local commanders didn\u2019t have the courage to report about it, so Stalin sent an angry secret cable asking if the Finnish informations are true? On top of that Beria had to inform Stalin about an incident that took place during the chaos: When NKVD 3rd Rear Regiment Commander, Major Lvov had tried to stop the fleeing Soviet soldiers, the political commissar of his Regiment, T\u0161erevko, shot Lvov. If a politruk shoots a commanding officer to be able to flee from the frontier, even in a Regiment of the Military Police, what will happen next?After that Stalin didn\u2019t want reports from London any longer. In February Beria ordered NKVD:s office in London to be shut down due to spreading of disinformation, and called back it\u2019s chief A.V. Gorski. *** When London\u2019s invaluable source of information died, it had a very strong impact on Finland. Paris was of the opinion, that the West\u2019s attitude towards Soviet Union grew drastically more negative. Stalin only had sources in Paris, reporting about the Allies\u2019 B-Plan, which sounded more definitive, logical and dangerous than it was in reality. Based upon information from Paris, Beria reported on 13th January 1940 to Stalin about the Allies\u2019 joint Conseil Supr\u00e8me -conference, where they discussed about helping Finland. The reason for the resignation of British defence minister Leslie Hore-Belisha was, that he opposed war with the Soviet Union.The War Party had the upper hand, with the fiercest being Weygand, Gamelin, Gort, and Ironside.The Allies were going to take action both in the Caucasus and in the North.They would also take action against Murmansk and Arkhangelsk.The report exaggerated: \u201cThe main task is to occupy Leningrad, which should be a hard and fatal blow to Soviet Union.\u201dThe exaggeration continued: They had already shipped 400 bombers and 200 armoured tanks from Bordeaux\u2019s harbor to Finland, as well as 6.000 soldiers.Immediately after taking action they would create a Russian national government and all white emigrants would be mobilized.As for Finland the Allies would send a Canadian division to Petsamo.That is when Stalin heard about Petsamo for the first time, but the Brits tried to conceal that part of their plan from Mannerheim.France was going to deliver war machinery and and weapons, as well as send engineer officers and experts on building fortresses to Finland.The most alarming information was General Weygand\u2019s trip to Syria and the Allies\u2019 plans to bomb Baku, Batum and Tuapse from the air.Turkey would later on join the attack on Caucasus.Stalin got the same information from GRU, attach\u00e9 T\u0161ornyi in London.Now all hell was breaking loose. Russians knew how difficult it was for the Allies to help Finland, or to even get to Finland, not to mention their inability to fight during winter conditions, Murmansk or Arkhangelsk were not as important as they were in 1941, but Caucasus was a different matter. Caucasus produced over 90 % of Soviet Union\u2019s raw oil and fuel. If Baku would be bombed from the air, not to talk about being occupied, it would have been a fatal blow to Soviet Union, as well as to it\u2019s financial and strategic relations with Germany. In order to weaken Moscow\u2019s Western relations, the Germans put forth information, that the French would attack Syria and trade it for Baku.All of a sudden Turkey became the hottest spot during Winter War.Molotov demanded to know from their Turkish diplomat. what was going on behind General Weygand\u2019s visit to Turkey and what the Turkish prime minister meant when he said, that we are living in a time when everyone conceals their every intentions.Moscow was further hyperventilating when the Turkish diplomats were called back to Turkey.Georgi Dimitrov met Stalin in the Bolshoi theatre on 21st January in 1940. Stalin told his closest circe about problems concerning Finland. Stalin had found out that, it was no more just about Finland, that the Finns had instigators and they were preparing for a huge war, they had more room for planes than Russians had. He promised that they would be killed to the last man. Then the atmosphere changed. General Georgi Kulik brought very bad news from the front. Stalin accused him of hyperventilating and told he would send him a book of psychology, where his condition is described. Nevermind that Stalin was hyperventilating himself. *** Finnish politician Hella Wuolijoki went to Stockholm to deliver the Finnish government\u2019s message in order to find out if there were any chances for peace, but NKVD:s agents treated her like she was a Russian spy, thinking she had come to tell them why everything had gone bonkers and how the mess could be solved. The main message of Wuolijoki\u2019s reports was this: Kuusinen\u2019s government had zero chances of getting even minor support,Helsinki\u2019s government was stable and steady, it was supported by the Finnish people, and it would not crumble, but the goverment was willing to make some concessions in order to get peace.If Stalin had a little more time, he would never had swallowed his pride and started to negotiate with a government, that he had declared does not even exist, that had refused to double down and had stained the reputation of the Red Army. He was in a hurry now, hence Moscow informed the Swedish government on 29th January 1940, that there was no objection to make peace with Helsinki\u2019s government. The same day Stalin told his own peopl: \u201cit is useless that Brits think Russians are stupid and are bears, who\u2019s brains work poorly.\"Soviet Union tried to calm down Sweden and even Brits, even attempting to get the Brits to be mediators. Molotov rejected the claim that Soviet Union was allying with Germany against the West, calling the claim \u201claughable\u201d.At the very same time Soviet Union was preparing for a new major attack on Finland, so that Finland would be forced to accept harsh conditions and so that they could save whatever was left of Red Army\u2019s military reputation.But Stalin didn\u2019t have time. NKVD:s rezidentura in Paris bombed him with alarming (and exaggerated) information. They mentioned that huge amounts of bombers had already been sent to Finland - ha ha ha - 176 from France, 164 from Britain, 44 from United States and 35 from Italy.Stalin knew about made plans to send three divisions to Finland, and that Sweden would let the divisions through despite Sweden\u2019s sham neutrality.Stalin was told that Polish emigrants would be in these divisions and that France\u2019s army had already distributed 20.000 snow suits and 20.000 mountain backpacks etc. etc.After the peace treaty was signed, NKVD got exact information: The Allies had grave difficulties on 14th March.Britain\u2019s foreign minister Lord Halifax had told, that it was impossible to send the 100 bombers Finns had asked for, as well as 50.000 soldiers by March.They could only send 12.000 soldiers at the earliest in April.And Sweden was nearly not as kind as he had thought.But it was already too late to change his mind. Stalin used the intelligence to confirm his own beliefs, and rejected all opposite information. In spring 1941 the Soviet intelligence got a stunning first-class information, but Stalin\u2019s suspicious mind and cemented attitude prevented him from gaining anything from it. Kreml never viewed smaller nations as any factors in the greater politics. Stalin also demanded only the raw material from the intelligence, he didn\u2019t want anyone\u2019s analysis except for his own analysis. That system works only if the main user never makes mistakes. After the Winter War Stalin understood, that he should have been better informed about the differences in Western powers. But of course he did not take the blame for that. A month after the Winter War had ended, Stalin held a four day long examination conference with Politbyro and commanders from the front, where he accused his intelligence officers of lacking a real spy\u2019s soul, and that they were naive. -\u201cA spy has to be consumed by poison and grudge, he is never to believe anyone. If you were spies you would know how the Western leaders critizise each other: your weapons aren\u2019t ready, you do poorly in this and that, you would know how they expose each other, spread their secrets. You should grab these things and forward them to your commanders, but you are too pure hearted.\u201dStalin ruined his own things both when starting and also when ending the war, because he refused see what cards the West has. He was forced to a Peace Treaty, a sorry compromise, because he didn\u2019t have the courage to continue for a few months more, which would have led to defeating Finland. Refefences can be found from the original article! (There are so many that it is useless to post them here) Ennen & nyt 4/02: \"Residenttimme ilmoittaa...\" Tiedustelun vaikutus Stalinin p\u00e4\u00e4t\u00f6ksiin talvisodassa Finland kicked more ass than the Russian propaganda, which was also repeated in the West, ever will admit. The West and Russia have manipulated information about the Winter War, suddenly claiming they sent bombers and weapons to Finland. Perhaps they were on the way to Finland, but never reached Finland. Red Army was our biggest - and fastest - supplier of war material. All and all we got more from the Red Army (read: looted) than from the West combined. A Soviet military man once visited our Artillery Museum and put his pants on fire, claiming that \u201cSoviet Union has never lost that much war material to Finland in the Winter War!\u201d He raised the matter when he returned to Soviet Union and it created a diplomatic hassle between Finland and Soviet Union. In the end Finland obeyed and erased all their \u201clies\u201d and replaced the amounts with Pravda-\u2019truths\u2019.But hey, each nation is entitled to their own opinion - except Finland. Why is there so little curiosity and interest in what really happened during Winter War, instead of repeating and repeating the same old Russian propaganda? Finland also participated in the Winter War, yet our information usually deemed as false lies and propaganda? Just asking\u2026 ",
