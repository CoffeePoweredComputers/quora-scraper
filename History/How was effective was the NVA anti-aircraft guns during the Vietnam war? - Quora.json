            "answer_text": "I have heard that it was pretty effective. The Americans would come in at high altitude and the NVA would shoot SAM\u2019s at them. The American tactic was to dive directly at the missile then break away at the last second. This required cojones grande on the part of the American pilots but it was something they never lacked. This brought the Americans down to low altitude where the AAA could shoot at them. Most of these guns were not radar directed but still claimed some downings. ",
