Historical Background By 1944, Poland had endured over 4 years of Nazi German occupation. The occupation of Poland stands out in its sheer brutality, as Hitler's followers waged a brutal racial war not only against Jews, but also against Polish Christians. Years before, on September the 1st, 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland. On September the 17th, the Soviet Union attacked Poland from the east and seized the eastern territories, in accordance with the Molotov Ribbentrop pact signed in collusion with Germany. While the Poles fought bravely, the nation was partitioned between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, and submitted to brutal occupation. The Germans mass murdered almost the entire Polish elite, slaying intellectuals, clergy, doctors and teachers in multiple forest massacres across Poland. In some places, the Nazi Einstatszgruppen, with the aid of local German Volksduetsche, elimated entire Polish communities, as they did in Pomerania. The ethnic genocide perpetrated against the Polish Christians by the Nazis is today largely forgotten. German attitude towards Poles is most aptly expressed by the fatal words credited to Hitler in the wake of his invasion of Poland in 1939 \u201cI have placed my deathhead formations in readiness- for the present only in the east-with orders to send to death mercilessly and without compassion men, women and children of Polish derivation and language. Only then can we gain the Lebenstraum we need. Who, after all, speaks of the annihilation of the Armenians?\u201d Adolf Hitler  In the east, the Soviets also committed brutal crimes against the Polish people. Over 20,000 Polish military officers and intellectuals were murdered in secret prisons and forests across the Soviet Union. Hundreds of thousands of Poles were sent to forced labor camps in Siberia and Central Asia, never to see their homelands again. The Soviet occupation of Eastern Poland would last until 1941, when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union.  By 1944, Soviet troops were advancing into Poland again, and the Germans were losing the war. As the Soviets entered Poland, they also encountered the Polish resistance, which was loyal to the Polish government in exile stationed in London. The Polish resistance, Armia Krajowa, was against both Nazi German and Soviet domination in Poland, and was considered by Stalin a threat to his ambitions in Central Europe. As Soviet soldiers attacked German positions in occupied Poland, Armia Krajowa gave the Soviet army aid and participated in liberating their own cities. After fighting ended however, Polish partisans were rounded up by the NKVD and arrested. Many were sent to the depths of Siberia, and others were forcibly conscripted into the Soviet army. Many Polish partisans, especially officers, were to be killed by the Soviets, even after giving them aid. It was clear to the Poles that the Soviets were not liberators, but rather another set of occupiers. The Polish underground decided to launch an uprising against the Germans in Warsaw, the Polish capital, in order to liberate it before the Soviets arrived. While the Poles expected aid from the Soviets, who were calling them to rise, the main goal of the uprising was to show the world that Poland was fighting for its freedom and that it could assert its independence, forcing the Stalin to recognize the democratic Polish government in exile. As the Soviets got even closer to Warsaw and the Germans were even more tired and demoralized, the uprising became ever more inevitable. Even Soviet planes were dropping leaflets encouraging the population to rise against their hated German oppressors. The Uprising Begins- August 1st, 1944  (Polish resistance fighters) The highly anticipated date of the uprising was announced as August the 1st, 17:00 hour. Polish underground soldiers began to gather at meeting points across the city, where they would launch their attacks upon the German garrison. The Polish plan aimed to surprise the Germans and quickly secure important buildings, fortifications, utilities and districts. After securing strategic locations, the Poles would hold against the German troops and wait for the Soviets to arrive and supply aid. At 1700 hours, the official uprising began, even though there were several minor skirmishes in the hours before. Polish units attacked German buildings, fortifications and other major points across the city. The initial results of the uprising were mixed, as the under armed Poles were able to secure the larger part of the city, but failed to capture many important strategic locations that were heavily defended. The Polish fighters managed to secure the city center, the old town, and large portions of the Wola districts, where the Poles suffered terrible losses. They also captured the post office, a German arsenal, and the Prudential building, but failed to secure the castle square, police district and airport, which remained securely in German hands.  Realizing that launching direct offensives at the German positions was suicidal, the AK entrenched themselves in their positions, building barricades and fortifications. While the Poles were under armed and separated from each other by German defenses, they were able to turn large portions of the city into a veritable death trap for attackers. The Germans, who still had to cope with the incoming Soviets, were forced to devote large amounts of resources in order to oust the Polish defenders in Warsaw, which was supposed to be a key point in the German defense against the Soviets. The words of Himmler describes the challenge the Germans were facing with the rebellious Poles, \u201cThis is the fiercest of our battles since the start of the war. It compares to the street battles of Stalingrad. SS chief Heinrich Himmler to German generals on 21 September 1944. The Wola Massacre- August 5th/12th  The the 4th of August marked the beginning of the German counterattack against the Polish fighters. SS General Erich von dem Bach was given command of all forces engaged in crushing the uprising, with SS General Hienz Rienefarth leading reinforcements.  (SS General Hienz Rienefarth) On the 5th of August, Hienz Rienefarth began pushing into the Wola district of Warsaw. Behind the fighting troops were death squads consisting of SS, Police and Wehrmacht troops, who went house to house, murdering all Polish occupants regardless of age or gender. Woman and children, old men and women, were dragged out of their houses and brutally murdered en mass, often in very cruel and sadistic ways. Civilians were intentionally targeted in order to weaken the resolve of the Polish underground. Rienefarth had received the orders to carry out this bloody massacre from Himmler himself. He was commanded to kill captured insurgents, wipe out the entire population of the city including women and children, and level the city to the ground. The accounts of survivors testify to the utter brutality of this massacre. \u2018Warsaw 1944', a book by historian Alexandra Richie, contains a rich variety of eyewitness accounts that provide a glimpse into the horror experienced by the civilians in Wola. 12 year old Jerzy Jankowski was in his home with his mother and siblings when the Germans raided the building next door. \u201cThe sight was terrifying. The fear paralyzed us and took our breath away. Over a dozen soldiers ran into the building and began looting. Then shots were fired and there was shouting: \u201cRaus! Wychodzicie skorej!\u201d A line was formed by the wall of the building across the street; The people faced the wall and held their hands in the air. A storm unit stood a few meters away with submachine guns in their hands. People started to shout out \u201cMercy!\u201d The horror intensified. For a moment there was silence, with only the sound of ammunition being reloaded. Then they were shot\u201d As the Germans moved deeper into Wola, where the population density increased, the blood bath intensified. German troops lobbed grenades into basements and set buildings on fire, gunning down the fleeing occupants. \u201cPeople were burning alive and engulfed in flames and ran to the Windows. Nobody upstairs could escape from the fire;and they all burned alive. Those on the ground floor tried to get out the doors, but were shot as they emerged\u2026. \u201cThe main entrance was full of the bodies of those who had tried to get away from the flames. I saw women among them with babies at their breast.\u201d After the Germans expelled defenders from the Hankiewicz houses at Wolska 105-109, they lobbed hand grenades in and threw\u2026 \u201cWhite incendiary powder which they carried with them in large bags. Everyone was burned alive or killed by hand grenades. No one could escape.\u201d Other civilians who were dosed with fire struggled under excruciating pain on the streets as they tried to escape. \u201cTheir clothes had caught on fire at once, especially the women's light dresses, and several of them could not go on. Their suffering was terrible, some of their eyes had been burned out, others were little more than an open wound on the whole body.\u201d Dr Joanna Kry\u0144ska remembered \u201cdrunk Germans in front of every house and streets covered in dead bodies. I did not enter Bema Street but could see a group of 150 people, mostly women and children, against a wall. After I passed I heard salvos. After a few hours I saw the dead bodies in the same place\u201d.  Jan Grabowski remembered the execution of the blacksmiths who lived at Wolska 124, as well as the murder of his family at the same place. \u201cThe group from our house numbered about five hundred people. When I got there with my family people were already lying down\u2026. The Germans started to shoot with a machine gun and rifles also to throw grenades into the crowd of people lying there. A military policeman walked over my body three times. I was not injured but my wife and children were murdered. I heard a military policeman give the order to kill my five year old son, who was crying; I heard a shot and the child was silent\u201d One of the most ruthless and merciless killers in human history, SS man Oskar Dirlewanger and his SS Sturmbrigade of partisan fighters, were responsible for some of the worst atrocities committed against civilians during the Warsaw Uprising.  (Oskar Dirlewanger) Dirlewanger's men were composed of some of the worst criminals and barbarians in the German SS, and had seen brutal action in Belarus. His men were viewed as the literal scum of humanity, and even seasoned SS soldiers attempted to distance themselves from him. In addition to his St\u00fcrmbrigade, he had an SD commando led by AS Untersturmf\u00fchrer Heinrich Amann, 3,000 Muslims from the North Caucasus, Russian deserters from the Red Army and two Azeri units as reinforcements. The Dirlewanger men were called into battle when the fighting was especially fierce and called for suicidal measures. One SS soldier recalled that\u2026 \u201cIn a normal time any loyal citizen would have taken this monster into custody away from the streets and would have locked him up\u2026. This man man dealt with incredible harshness and granted no pardon\u201d. Another German soldier recalls that the Dirlewanger men were almost suicidal in their assaults. He recalls one assault against a building defended by Polish snipers in particular. A previous unit of SS soldiers was decimated by Polish fire, and the Dirlewanger men were sent to clean things up. \u201cThat\u2019s when the Dirlewanger crowd was brought in. The horde arrived, took one look and stormed in. About 50 men rushed across the street. Around 30 remained lying there, no longer moving. The remainder disappeared into the building, and over the next few minutes both corpses and the living flew out of the windows of the fourth and fifth floors. The Dirlewanger guys did not bother to give speeches. This is how the houses in Warsaw were cleaned up.\u201d The testimony of Matthias Schenk, a young Wehrmacht soldier from German speaking Belgium, provides a valuable eyewitness account testifying to the sheer brutality of Dirlewanger. Schenk was repulsed by the crimes he witnessed, and even helped several people escape death. He took part assaulting Polish positions, and witnessed the Dirlewanger first hand. \u201c At the time we called him (Dirlewanger) a butcher, but very quietly, because it was very easy to be hanged in the Dirlewanger Brigade. Dirlewanger had this habit of hanging people every Thursday, Poles or his own people, it didn't matter. He often kicked the stool himself.\u201d Schenk recalls when the Dirlewanger men forced themselves into basements \u201cWhen we forced ourselves into basements, the Dirlewanger men followed and the women were always raped. Sometimes a few of the men raped the same women one after the other without putting down their weapons. In one basement, Dirlewangers men burst in. One took a woman. She was pretty and did not scream. He raped her, pressing her head down to the table with one hand and holding the bayonet in the other. Afterwards he cut her blouse open. Then he cut her from her stomach to her throat. After raping his victims, this trooper was known for putting hand grenades into the vaginas of Warsaw women and detonating them.\u201d Schenk recalled witnessing the murder of 350 Polish children at the Orthodox Children's Home at Wolska 149 on the 5th of August. \u201cA lot of Children were standing on the stairs with hands raised. Lots of Children. All with their little hands in the air. We (Wehrmacht) looked at them for a while until Dirlewanger appeared. He ordered that they all be killed. They killed them and then stepped on the children's bodies, smashing their little heads with the buts of their guns. The stairs were covered in blood\u201d. Schenk recalled that the Dirlewanger men designated a crippled 12 year old boy as their \u2018mascot\u2019 in Wola. \u201cHe had lost one leg but could jump very fast on one. He was very proud of this. He always jumped around the soldiers, one way and then another. We said it was for luck. He helped us out a little. One day the SS called out to him. He jumped over eagerly. They were laughing, and told him to jump toward the trees. From far away I saw that they had put two grenades into his bag, but he didn't notice. He was jumping away and they laughed at him shouting \u201cSchneller!\u201d. Then the boy blew up.\u201d The killing in Wola also entered the hospitals, and their destruction was sanctioned by both the SS and the Wehrmacht. One account from a Pole who witnessed murdered hospital patients recalled\u2026. \u201cOn the floors, on the beds and in the corners, bodies lying or half sitting, leaning on the wall, hanging from the metal railings of the beds half naked, in hospital gowns torn to shreds. The bed linen, pillows and comforters were spread on the floor, sticky with blood which turned into black puddles on the floor\u201d. One woman who was almost executed recalled \u201cWe were ordered to form rows of twelve people, and were driven into the yard of the building by the viaduct. At the entrance Ukrainians (six in number) shot from close range at every person who entered, and thus the dead fell into the flames of the burning buildings. I saw clearly, when waiting my turn in the first group of twelve people, doctors and assistants in white aprons and also priests being shot. Amongst the doctors was Professor Grzybowski. Then the wounded and sick in the other rows were driven to their death, and when people were brought on stretchers first that person was shot and then the stretcher bearers. It was only by a miracle that I escaped death. When I was pushed to the entrance in the group of twelve I lied to one of the officers that I and my companions were Volksduetsche, as I speak German well. So the German ordered us to fall back and follow him. He led us to a German first aid station there. About five hundred people were shot in my presence, many from the Wolski hospital.\u201d Religion was especially scorned by Dirlewanger, and priests were brutally murdered. Here, Schenk, our tormented German soldier, recalls an assault upon a church\u2026 \u201cWe blew up the back door of the monestary which led to the cellar. A priest was standing in front of us. He had a communion wafer and a chalice in his hands. Acting on impulse-I don't know- we genuflected and took the communion. A third from our group ran in and did the same. Then the SS stormed in and there were the usual shots, screams and groans. A few hours later I saw that priest in Dirlewanger\u2019s hands. They drank wine from the chalice, the wafers were scattered and broken. They were urinating on a cross leaning against the wall. They were torturing the priest: he had a bloody face and torn cassock. We took that priest from them, it was an impulse. They were surprised, but so drunk that they did not know what was happening. The next day, they did not remember at all.\u201d German Lieutenant Peter Stolten, who had been moved from France to fight in Warsaw, also expressed remorse and horror at the crimes he witnessed in Wola in a letter to his parents \u201cWarsaw shows the true face of war. I am used to male bodies, but when I see torn female bodies and see how lovely they were once, when I see children whose innocence is there no matter which language they speak\u2026 You will say for certain that I should not and am not allowed to write like this.\u201d Between August the 5th and 12th, over 50,000 Polish civilians were murdered in Wola alone.  Ochota Massacre, August 4th/25th  While the Dirlewanger brigade was cleansing the district of Wola, the SS RONA Brigade commanded by Bronislav Kaminski was committing unspeakable atrocities in the district of Ochota. The SS RONA Brigade (Russian National Liberation Army) was composed of Russian and other Slavic Soviet citizens who deserted the Soviet army to fight against Stalin. Known as the Vlasov men, they were used as anti partisan troops, and perpetrated mass murders and crimes against civilians in Belarus. At its height, RONA numbered 20,000 men. On August the 5th, 1,700 RONA troops and 400 man police battalion were set against the 400 poorly armed Polish defenders in Ochota. Despite the superior numbers of the RONA men, they proved extremely unmotivated and lacked the desire to fight. To them, the war was already over, and there was nothing left to die for. Desensitized criminals, the only activity of importance for the men of the RONA Brigade was looting, raping and killing. The RONA men were ragged and ill kept, resembling a circus more than a fighting force. Henryk Poborski recalled that.. \u201cThey were dirty, in shoes and uniforms torn into pieces and grenades strung around their necks and machine guns hanging on some. Some had steel helmets, some had caps. They had ammunition belts slung around their shoulders, and their faces looked old before their time. Only the RONA patch, with its distinctive white cross, sewn on the left shoulders gave away their identity.\u201d Despite their bedraggled, almost comical appearance, the RONA men were no less ruthless than the Dirlewanger men in Wola. \u201cThe Gr\u00f3jecka buildings were targeted early, with dozens of RONA men swarming through the apartments looking for alcohol. They look 160 boys and men, pushed them into the cellar, shot them in the back of the head and then threw in grenades. This was repeated in a number of buildings, which were then set on fire.\u201d One of the most sadistic crimes committed by the RONA Brigade in Ochota occurred in the Radium Institute, which was founded by the native Marie Curie in 1925. While other hospitals were eliminated across Warsaw, the methods used by RONA at the Radium Institute stand out in barbarism. Jadwiga Bobi\u0144ska recounts her eyewitness testimony of the first assault on the hospital. \u201cA crowd of strange looking soldiers were coming towards us in uniforms we did not recognize. After a while we heard the sound of Russian. They were Russians.\u201d Richie, the author of \u201cWarsaw 1944\u201d, writes, \u201cThe men rushed into the hospital, yelling at the terrified patients and shooting at random. About 90 patients and 80 members of staff and their families were in the building. First the RONA men raided the pharmacy, and drank all the rubbing alcohol; when they went from room to room, looting and stealing valuables from their terrified victims. Then they started raping staff and patients; many of the latter bedridden women suffering from terminal cancer but that made no difference. Another group, mostly staff, were driven into the hospital garden and forced to march to Zieleniak camp in Gr\u00f3jecka street; many of the women were taken away at night and raped. 90 patients and staff were trapped in the Hospital. RONA soldiers guarded the complex, and shot anyone trying to leave. They returned to rape all the women patients on the ground floor; the victims were then shot and their mattresses covered with petrol and set alight. Three women-an X RAY assistant, a nurse and a patient-managed to slip out of the building; two of them were caught, taunted, repeatedly raped and then murdered. Their blood soaked bodies were left in the garden. The Kaminski men then set the hospital on fire, but it refused to burn outright, and the sixty or so surviving patients and staff tried to shield themselves from the smoke and heat. Over the following days the RONA men came and took the younger women away; again they would be raped and killed in the garden. At other times they would try to set the building on fire. They were always drunk\u2026.. The Germans looted the hospital of all its remaining equipment, then announced that they were unable to help the prisoners, as it was not in their power to do so. It was a death sentence. On the 19th of August, the RONA soldiers returned and the remaining prisoners were shot. The doctors, nurses and other staff taken to Zieleniak camp were brought back to the Institute, where an officer shot them in the back of the neck. Their bodies were heaped in a pile, covered in petrol, and burned.\u201d Zieleniak camp was a location where the RONA soldiers herded Polish civilians they did not kill to keep them contained. The old farmers market was cramped and exposed to the sun, and the prisoners began to starve. Women gave birth under the open sun, and RONA soldiers often shot into the crowd for sport. The whole scene must have been worthy of Dante's Inferno. \u201cOn the 8th of August the RONA men decided to \u2018feed\u2019 the camp by driving a herd of cows inside. The cows stampeded and started to trample us. Drunk RONA soldiers sat on the walls and began to shoot at the cows and into the crowd; they only stopped when the cows lay dead. The starving people tore into them for meat\u201d. \u201cRape was simply a way of life for the RONA men, who saw the women of Warsaw as a prize they had earned for years of service to Germany. Zieleniak was the most convenient place to commit this crime, as thousands of women were trapped there for the choosing. From the first night soldiers walked around shining torches on people huddled on the ground. Eerie bright circles landed on terrified faces, and girls and women were simply hauled away. They were often raped in an allotment area or behind the wall, but could be taken anywhere, including the market toilets.\u201d The crimes of the RONA battalion claimed the lives of 10,000 civilians in Ochota alone.  Bloody Street Fighting  (Polish AK in action)  While the Germans were mercilessly murdering Polish civilians, they were also suffering severe losses. The Warsaw Uprising has not been compared to Stalingrad for nothing. In Wola, Von dem Bach sent the Schmidt group to attack the last strongholds in Wola. Fierce fighting raged for every street and threshold. Polish AK's \u2018Chrobry' 1 and 2 also counter attacked and managed to recapture German positions in the darkness of night. Along Towarowa and Chmielna streets, Polish AK soldiers engaged in fierce hand to hand fighting with the Germans. The Germans met fierce resistance among the moss covered tombstones of the old cemeteries that dominated the districts Northern border. Almost a forlorn reminder of Poland's long, rich and multi ethnic past, the tombstones of Catholic Poles, Jews, Muslim Tatars, Lutherans, and prominent citizens had yet to receive the bodies of its youngest sons, the Poles of Warsaw.  On the 10th of August, Colonel Schmidt attacked the old Calvinist and Lutheran cemeteries, where some of the most able of the Polish forces were making a last stand under officer Jan Mazurkiewicz. The Poles were hiding behind tombstones, waiting for the enemy to get close in order to inflict maximal casualties. Fighting was fierce and bloody, with shattered tombstones ricocheting across the battleground, wounding the men. \u201cNurses (Polish) trying to get the wounded out, but when the shelling became too much they used the small benches normally kept beside the graves to make steps down into the catacombs. Many of the coffins were made of metal, and were now used as operating tables\u201d. The Germans were shocked by the scale of the Polish resistance, and suffered terrible casualties as they pushed on forward to the Jewish and Catholic cemeteries. The German 9th army daily report revealed \u201cThey (Poles) defend themselves everywhere and very fiercely. They use highly effective tactics of close fighting, so they allow the St\u00fcrm groups and support groups and even tanks to get to a certain place and then destroy them by accurate fire. Soldiers and wounded who escape the fighting report that the deaths are caused almost exclusively by head wounds.\u201d Polish fighter Janusz Brochowicz Lewi\u0144ski also testified to the skill of the German forces.. \u201cThe enemy was so well hidden that I almost could not see them. They were experienced soldiers from the Eastern Front who knew how to camouflage themselves by attaching leaves to their uniforms\u2026 they were excellent shots and hid in the branches of trees or in corners between gravestones. These soldiers had very good sights attached to their guns, and they searched for targets. I became the victim of of an excellent shot who nearly killed me.\u201d The courageous Polish defense of the cemeteries in Wola held the German advance for an entire week, and allowed the defenders of the old town to consolidate their defenses and prepare for the German assault. Hundreds of AK soldiers were wounded and killed, and the Poles had to find a way to escape to the Old Town to carry on the fight. \u201cThey had to retreat through the ruined Jewish ghetto. Unlike in Ochota, they could not use the sewers, as to their horror, they had discovered that they were filled with the bodies of Jewish victims killed during the Ghetto rising a year before. They escaped into the old town through the rubble and under heavy fire. It was the end for Wola.\u201d In Ochota, fierce fighting between the Germans and the Polish defenders took place. The Poles reported that the Russian RONA were utterly useless in the fight and were poor fighters. The reports of vicious crimes across the city bolstered the Polish resolve, with most defenders determining that they rather fight to the death than be brutally murdered. Andrzej Ulankiewicz recounts his experience \u201cAll the windows at ground level had been barricaded with sandbags or barred to prevent access. Some drunken RONA soldiers decided to get at us by climbing up the iron drain pipes. When they got to the second floor they were liquidated by our sentries. The enemy, true to form, never attacked at night. We only heard the sounds of their debauchery-screams of raped women and the crying of those being murdered.\u201d The RONA men were so useless that the Germans had to call in a unit of the Ukrainian SS Galizen Division to finish the job. AK soldiers pelted German tanks and infantry with Molotov cocktails and filpinki, as the Germans were gaining ground. One weapon that was key to the German success was the infamous Goliath\u2019s, which were remote controlled vehicles filled with TNT, that would cause unspeakable damage upon exploding at an enemy target. Andrzej Ulankiewicz recalled the moment when Goliaths hit his building.. \u201cThe vastness of the destruction was unbelievable\u2026. this corner section of the solidly built edifice was reduced to little more than a one story heap of rubble\u2026\u201d  As the AK soldiers were forced out of Ochota by the Germans, the Nazis committed even more unspeakable crimes. W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman, the famous Jewish pianist, recounted\u2026 \u201cHours later I watched the SS and Ukrainians rounding up people from another building. People carrying bundles on their backs, mother's with children clutching at them, were driven into this cordon. The SS and the Ukrainians brought many of the men out of the cordon and killed them in front of everybody for no reason at all, just as they did in the Ghetto while it still stood.\u201d Fight for the Old Town  (Reconstruction of the Old Town in Warsaw. What stands today is only a shadow of the past) The Old Town of Warsaw was once legendary for its richness and beauty, with its skyline of tall towers and colorful spires and domes. The Warsaw castle and numerous palaces filled with beautiful artwork were the talk of Europe. It was in this serene setting, that some of the most violent fighting of the entire war would take place. After taking Wola, the Germans concentrated their forces on the old town. The district was vitally important to the Germans because it flanked the Vistula river and gave direct access to Kierbed\u017a bridge. German soldiers were holding out on the opposite bank of the Vistula in the suburb of Praga, and were preparing for a defense against the incoming Soviets. If the old town was not taken from the Poles, the Germans in Praga would be completely cut off and destroyed. The Vistula urgently needed to be secured by General von dem Bach. Alexandra Richie describes the layout of the battlefield \u201cThe fiercest fighting around the Old Town in the first weeks of August 1944 took place in an area measuring 10 kilometers, and shaped rather like an onion, with the Vistula at its base and concentric rings running around the tiny Medieval core. The outermost layer consisted of the no man's land bordered by the Traugutta fort and the Gda\u0144sk railway station to the north, the former ghetto to the west, and the Senatorska street and the ruins of the Warsaw castle to the south. The next layers were made up of imposing swathes of grand eighteenth and nineteenth century buildings put up after the \u2018Swedish Deluge, which had destroyed much of the city in the 1650s.\u201d All throughout the old town were further grand structures and monuments. The Germans would face a grave challenge attempting to break through the Polish defenses in this veritable fortress of winding streets and towering buildings. The Poles also prepared carefully designed barricades and fortifications, and set up numerous sniper nests in concealed locations. The elite troops under Mazurkiewicz, who had fought valiantly at Wola, also bolstered the defenses. The elite Kedyw group, and legendary battalions \u2018Czata 49', \u2018Miot\u0142a', \u2018Pi\u0119\u015bc\u2019 \u2018Le\u015bnik' and \u2018Walig\u00f3ra\u2019 were all ready to defend the city, amounting to 8,000 Polish fighters within the district alone. The Old Town was a death trap for the incoming Germans. SS General Reinefarth, the commanding criminal from Wola, was oblivious concerning the true nature of the Polish defenses. With typical Nazi arrogance, Rienefarth confidently asserted that he would have control of the Old Town within a week. On August the 11th, when the Germans began their assault, they were shocked by the fierce and concentrated resistance that met them. Polish troops hid behind barricades, holding fire until the Germans were almost unbearably close to their positions. When the Germans retreated, the Poles often counter attacked, killing many horrified enemies while they were escaping. In a number of buildings, Poles and Germans were locked in bitter hand to hand combat. German morale plummeted as they made almost no progress. Polish snipers inflicted severe losses among the attackers. AK soldier Stanis\u0142aw Likiernik remembered snipers firing from the church at Ko\u015bcielna street. \u201cTwo German soldiers tried to hide by using the back of a sofa as a shield. Two almost simultaneous gunshots and both soldiers were flat on the ground with the settee as their ready made coffin\u201d. The civilians in the Old Town were initially lulled into a false sense of security by the success of the Polish fighters. People freely roamed the streets, ate food, and sang songs together. The AK was beloved. \u201cWe loved our army, the strange army of intelligentsia and workers and teenage boys with helmets covering their eyes and young girls serving Warsaw\u201d. Refugees from Wola who managed to escape found the old town an unexpected haven of refuge. Miron Bia\u0142oszewski recalled\u2026 \u201cit was already a famous redoubt. Impregnable. Barricades. Serpentine streets. Not for tanks. Stare Miasto is strong. It's walls are solid. Thick.\u201d Yet it was not realized that soon the relatively tranquil setting of the Old Town interior would also be transformed into a bloodbath. On August 12th, the Germans attacked again. Rienefarth directed his attack in three directions, his entire force consisting of 3,000 men. Fierce fighting exploded across the front lines, but the Poles refused to buckle to the Germans. The AK lured German tanks close to concealed positions, destroying them with PIATS, Molotov cocktails, home made flilpinki grenades and anti tank gums dropped in Warsaw by the British. \u201cWhen Dirlewanger attacked the ruins of the Royal Castle his new Hetzer armoured vehicles were pelted with filipinki's; when they retreated the remaining troops were shot down by snipers\u201d.  (Filipinki, improvised Polish grenades) Whenever the Germans withdrew, the Polish AK counter attacked, never giving the enemy a moment of rest. The Germans attempted to use civilian human shields to advance forward at Leszno, but were again repulsed. In the south, where Dirlewanger was attacking, fighting was particularly intense, as Dirlewanger threw his men relentlessly upon the Polish defenders. \u201cDirlewanger was determined to take it (Piwna Street), but the men of the Wigry battalion had constructed the barricade in such a way that the attackers were forced into a funnel only a few meters wide, making it impossible for tanks to get through. Dirlewanger never succeeded in taking it, despite the huge loss of life there\u201d. Accounts from German army diary's and Commanders paint a very grim picture for the German attackers. Generalleutnant Reiner Stahel reported that.. \u201cthis part of Warsaw is densely built up and extremely difficult for us. It is impossible to see even with air reconnaissance\u2026 It is impossible to see the Polish defensive positions or where the enemy is located. This is a war in three dimensions with the soldiers having to move between the streets and courtyards, always looking upwards to the roofs and downwards to the cellar. When we attacked we moved forward blindly, and fighting very quickly turned into hand to hand combat. Polish morale is high and although we had superior weapons and more troops than the AK, the Poles had the will to fight. It was impossible to destroy them and the use of mortars was very difficult. Buildings create natural anti Panzer defences and the narrow streets become even smaller the more you move into the city center.\u201d The Germans became increasingly demoralized by the situation, with regular Wehrmacht troops even refusing to attack positions. Officers made up a disproportionate percentage of German losses. The problem of morale was so problematic that Gunderian brought it to Hitler's attention in the Wolfsschanze, \u201cThe fight for houses costs an unusually high number of NCOs. When the officers and NCOs don't leap out the men refuse to move forward.\u201d The current German strategy against the Old Town was an utter failure. Yet, there was no limits to the inhumanity of Hitler when he wanted something accomplished. In this case, the complete destruction of Warsaw. The Siege Hitler had always been enthralled by big guns, explosives, and technological solutions to military problems. In Warsaw he was able to put his interest into practice. The results were deadly. Hitler deployed his greatest guns to smash the city to dust, and concentrated his fire on the old town. Using the same monster guns that he used to demolish Sevastopol, he ordered their powerful shells to be concentrated on the tight 10 Kilometers that was the Old Town. Packed with only a few thousand soldiers and 75,000 civilians, Hitler's move was barbarous and insane. The destruction of Warsaw was not for any tactical advantage. Rather, it was to be an example for any other people's who wanted to rise against the strength of the Reich. The bloodshed began on August the 13th, when Polish troops captured a Borgward BIV. The Borgward was one of Hitler's beloved \u2018Wunderwaffen', and the largest of the German remote controlled demolition tanks.  The Poles were overjoyed after capturing what they believed to be a German armored vehicle. Excited soldiers drove the \u2018tank\u2019 to AK headquarters, right in the center of the Old town. An hour later, the time bombs in the vehicle exploded. Over 300 civilians were killed in one explosion. \u201cA huge mass of human remains, rubble, pieces of wood and iron. There were terrifying screams of the victims calling for help-people in pain, burned black, blinded and impossible to recognize. Pieces of human bodies hang from broken eaves, there are pieces of bodies on the street, on roofs, everywhere..\u201d \u201cBurned and blinded people lay in corridors, on the stairs, in the basement, on newspapers or sacks as there are no mattresses or blankets. Their faces are swollen, black from smoke and fire and yellow from disinfectant powder.\u201d  Unopposed by the nearby Soviet air force, the German Luftwaffe ruled the skies above Warsaw and targeted Polish civilians at will. Stuka\u2019s ranged through the skies, dropping tons of bombs on the helpless defenders. Often times, German pilots swooped in low and machine gunned civilians. Janina Lasocka remembered a group of girl scouts who had come to the old town to fight for Warsaw. \u201cOne day the Stuka came and targeted the left wing of our building. All of the girls were hit and died.\u201d The planes commenced bombing of the city from 600 AM in the morning daily, dropping their bombs every half hour. German infantry commanders requested attacks on specific targets before moving in on Polish defenses. \u201cThe bombing exhausted everyone: Rescuing, digging out, extinguishing fires, helping-it was difficult, but people did it\u2026 it was made impossible by new bombs falling all the time, more fires being set. Or rather, it was hopeless. A vicious circle. At someone's cry, \u201cPlanes!\u201d, we rush to a cellar, a shallow crawl space housing a workshop for glass cylinders and bombs. A crash. Panic. Prayer. Explosions. The rumbling, bursting of bombs. Groans and fear. Again they fly low. And explosions, they're probably bombing the front, we crouch down\u2026. And suddenly something rocks our house. Window frames, doors, glass panes are blown out. Explosions. The end? Still more crashes. Even more explosions. While Panzers could not assault the Old Town, the Germans deployed the newly created Sturmpanzer IV Brummb\u00e4r, or \u2018Grizzly Bear\u2019, to crush Polish defenses and smash holes in the city. A huge vehicle protected by 100mm of armor on its front, the Sturmpanzer could move in close to the enemy, shooting it's 150mm howitzer.  Other weapons, like Jagdpanzer 38 \u201cHetzers\u201d, 7.5 cm Pak 40s, and Wurfrahmen 40s, were also deployed in August 1944 to crush the uprising. The Goliath\u2019s tore through Polish defenses, killing both soldiers and civilians. At times, the Goliath\u2019s claimed German lives when Poles managed to destroy them close to German lines. The young German officer Peter Stolten lost his crew twice in this way \u201cMy own Goliath killed our soldiers for the second time. The enemy shot at us, detonating 1,000 Kilos just three meters from my vehicle\u2026 I lay for hours, blinded, amongst the groaning wounded.\u201d Another destructive weapon the Germans used in Warsaw was the gigantic Panzerzug 75. This mortar train was rushed back and forth along the Gda\u0144sk railway tracks, spewing death from its 105mm howitzers.  A weapon that particularly terrified Polish civilians were the \u2018Krowas' or fixed rocket launchers that spread flammable bombs through the city. Victims were burnt alive by the explosions, and the shells made horrifying noises, reminiscent of wailing cows. Adam Bie\u0144, described victims of a Krowa attack.. \u201cAs I got closer I saw something on a stretcher that had been a human being before. Now it was a black, charred corpse, with a charred head and face and shining eyes. It was a person burned by a Krowa.\u201d \u201cCrash, Crash, Crash, six times. God how those walls moved\u2026 fires, wind blasts, flying walls, people with children in their arms hurling themselves en mass in the direction of the water barrel, to the narrow passageway leading to the far cellars, and people from the far shelters rushing to our shelter.\u201d   On the 18th of August flamethrowers of the SS J\u00e4ger Abteilung arrived  The most devastating weapon brought against the defenders were the Karl-Ger\u00e4t Mortars, 11 meter long guns that each weighed 120,000 kilograms and required a crew of over a hundred men just to move them. Each shell weighed 1,577 Kilos each, and caused gaping holes through building and the pavement. \u201cThe effect on the civilians was devastating. A direct hit would bring down any nearby building. One shell exploded next to a crowded cellar, leaving a crater half the length of the street. It's bad. The crowds panic. With packages, bundles. They run about. Some towards the gate. Others away from the gate. People were buried when massive shells fell on houses and apartment buildings, and nothing could be done to save them. We saw people digging out something white. We all knew that when instead of a cellar or houses there is a hole\u2026. many people have perished. So they bombed through the cellars after all.\u201d  The bombing not only killed many civilians, but was meant to destroy Warsaw. All the symbols of Polish culture and accomplishment were being destroyed, and there was nothing the Poles could do about it. Irena Orska, an eyewitness, wrote\u2026 \u201cThe beauty built up through the centuries of Polish history was burning before our bloodshot eyes\u2026 the slenderness of the 14th century cathedral of St. John, the Knights Street, the polychrome of the ancient market place\u2026. I cried in helpless rage.\u201d In addition to the relentless barrage, the Poles were also short of food. The AK did not expect the uprising to last so long, and were anticipating Soviet aid, which had still not arrived. The Polish civilians were starving to death\u2026 \u201cWhatever did not escape, fly away, burn up, cave in, die, was hunted down. Cats disappeared. Dogs disappeared.\u201d Even more agonizing was the lack of fresh water, as the Germans had shut off the city water supply. Civilian authorities oversaw the construction of wells, which the Germans began to target in their strikes. The city was burning, and there was no water to be found. Stomachs were empty, and even the supply of dogs and cats were running low. Bodies littered the street, but there was no place to bury them. Fires were put out, only for the Germans to reignite them. Morale was running low, and many civilians began to blame the AK for starting the uprising. The Germans Close In While Hitlers weapons were pulverizing the Old Town, German ground troops were still struggling to make any real progress. The Polish AK was still fiercely resisting the enemy, and the Vistula had yet to be secured. On the 18th of August, Von dem Bach sent a offer of surrender to the Polish commander, Bor Komorowski, promising to spare the city if the Poles surrendered. The Poles refused the offer, aiming to hold out until the Soviets would arrive, cross the Vistula, and assault the German forces. When the Poles did not respond, it became clear to the Germans that they had to expel them by force. Himmler gathered all the men he could muster, mostly SS recruits from Russia, Central Asia and the Caucasus. Dirlewanger was also sent the 579th Cossack\u2019s, the 580th Russian cavalry unit, 500th Motorized Battalion of Sturm sappers, and a fresh supply of Goliath\u2019s. Between them, Dirlewanger, Reck and Stahel would converge upon the Poles with a force of 13,400 men. The attack was launched on early on the 19th of August. The attack was fierce and brutal. Polish commander, Bor Komorowski recalled, \u201cFirst came the planes, then the artillery. The most dangerous fire was from the Panzer trains, and the greatest destruction was caused by fire from the krowas. Artillery fire went on non stop from morning until midday, and then the attack itself began. The first line was with the Goliath\u2019s. Their task was to destroy the barricades and the walls of the buildings. Behind the Goliath\u2019s were the Tiger tanks, which put our positions under direct fire. Only after this did the foot soldiers move in.\u201d The Germans began squeezing the Poles deeper and deeper into the old city, encircling the insurgents and civilians from all sides. Despite the German advance, the Polish AK fought with great valor, and made the enemy pay for every foot of ground with blood. German soldier August Weller wrote in his journal on August 21st \u201cPolish banditen in Warsaw fight fanatically and fiercely. The results achieved by our units after three weeks of fighting are pathetic despite the support of numerous and the most modern types of weapons.\u201d  (Polish AK soldiers fighting in the rubble of Warsaw) Some Polish soldiers managed to cut across German lines and make it to Zoliborz, a district under Polish control that was still untouched by the Germans. From Zoliborz, the Poles attempted to destroy the Panzer train stationed on the Gdansk railway tracks. The attacking Poles were butchered, suffering 80% casualties. The German onslaught intensified and grew ever more violent. The Germans targeted the gigantic Mint building with 1,600 troops. Fighting to capture the gigantic structure was brutal. \u201cIn scenes reminiscent of the grand elevator in Stalingrad, two hundred AK soldiers fought the Germans in bloody hand to hand combat for each floor. Schmidt\u2019s men finally took the building on August the 28th. They immediately went to the cellar, and murdered all the wounded Poles. It was a grim foretaste of what was to come.\u201d The Polish defense on the Northern side caved in, and the Germans began pressing into the Old Town around Krasinski square. As the Germans advanced, terrified civilians rushed deeper into the old town, until the center of the city became over crowded and backed with people hiding in cellars and buildings. By August the 25th, the Luftwaffe was dropping bombs on a narrow 3 kilometer area every fifteen to twenty minutes. \u201cIt was impossible to get used to the planes. Every fifteen to twenty minutes or so they dropped bombs. They didn\u2019t care what they hit as long as they destroyed everything. So the ruins were hit for the third time, the fourth time. Even the ruins were disappearing.\u201d A eye witness recalls the desperate state of the civilian population, \u201cThe condition of life for the population was worsened by the destruction of 20 further houses.. the administration authority cannot cope any more. Starosta, the head of civilian authority in North Warsaw, is young and inexperienced. There is no water or gas, and the latrines are so stuffed that people have started relieving themselves everywhere. The stench is horrible, but you don\u2019t see any building of public latrines as there is nowhere to build, on every square there are tombs, and their number is mounting from hour to hour. The situation in the Old Town was dire. The Germans were coming. The Poles had to escape. Into the Sewers  (Replica of Warsaw sewers-minus several feet of thick, waste filled water, pitch darkness and dead, decaying bodies) An evacuation had to take place so that the soldiers of the AK could continue the fight in the districts that the Germans had not yet captured. The most logical means of travel was the sewers, which would allow the Poles to escape right underneath the feet of the Germans. While for the first few weeks most of the sewers were impassable as they were flooded with waste filled water, the Germans had turned off the water supply of the city and now only several feet of thick, dirty water remained, allowing the Poles to use the passages as tunnels. The first Poles to be evacuated were the Polish leadership, including Bor Komorowski, who were too valuable to be lost to the Germans. After the leaders were evacuated, the Poles attempted to use the sewers as a means of attacking the advancing Germans by surprise, with plans to seize the Plac Bankowy and attack the Germans from behind, where they least expected. Most of the Polish soldiers were massacred, running into barricades, machine gunned, and pounded by artillery. After this last attempt to break out had failed, plans were furthered to evacuate the AK within the Old Town. Around 4,500 people, including 1,500 soldiers, were given passes and a precise time at which they were to gather at the manhole on Krasinski square. Every two hours, section leaders would allow groups of 50 people to enter the sewer to escape to the Srodomiescie, or city center. These evacuation were initially hidden from civilians in order to avoid mass panic. Despite the practical reasons behind the cover up, this embittered many civilians against the AK. The atmosphere in the sewers was tight, dark, smelly and difficult to bear. \u201cAs the drains narrowed, movement became more difficult. We go with candles.. then to a very narrow sewer where we have to bend down. The walls are sticky.. it is exhausting, especially for tall people. Then to an area where the water is very high. It is disgusting.\u201d \u201cWe move on holding with one hand the back of the person in front of us, the second hand to feel the wall. Later, we have to crouch to walk. It is tiring. One of the people in line looses consciousness, a two meter high lieutenant who was wounded in the face; the soldiers around him move on.\u201d \u201cWounded and exhausted men and women would fall and drown. In a few hopeless cases the medics spared their suffering with lethal injections of morphine. It was a nightmarish journey.\u201d On the 2nd of September, 3 in the morning, the last AK soldiers left the Old Town. At this, the civilians began to flock to the manhole, desperate to leave the area and escape captivity or murder at the hand of the Germans and their mercenaries. \u201cAround 7 AM, an air attack covered the manhole with rubble. People clawed it away and started to go down again. Then disaster struck at 9 AM, when the court of appeal building was bombed. The entire structure came down with a great crashing sound, covering the manhole and hundreds of people. Those nearby watched in horror as their loved ones were buried alive, and despaired as their last hope of escape disappeared under the ruins.\u201d The defense of the Old Town was over. Polish casualties in Old Town are 30,000 civilian dead and 7,500 dead and wounded insurgents (77 percent), German casualties were 3,900 dead and wounded (54 percent). Crimes in the Old Town As German troops entered the Old Town, there was initially some hope that civilians would be spared the mass murders of Wola. However, while the Germans did not murder every Pole that came across their sights, they shot all Polish soldiers and committed more unspeakable crimes against civilians. \u201cThere is at least, some kind of record of those murdered in the clinics and hospitals of the Old Town, but many of the thousands of wounded lying unable to move in the basements and cellars died forgotten and alone. The Germans went from building to building, ordering people at gun point to leave their hiding places. Those who were too afraid or too badly injured to come out were shot, burned or killed by hand grenades dropped in through the grates.\u201d German Wehrmacht soldier, Willi Fiedler, was a key eyewitness to crimes perpetrated by the SS in the Old Town of Warsaw. Fiedler\u2026. \u201cwatched as groups of a hundred and 150 were brought into the yard. They were divided into smaller groups , which were then forced to turn to a second yard and lie on the bodies of those who were already dead. Some of them were pulled by the hair and then they were shot by SS men in the back of the neck. The next group was supposed to climb on the dead bodies, or they were pulled there and shot. And so on and so on until the whole pile was full and all the Poles had been executed. I saw nine or ten layers of the dead in one pile, women and babies were executed with them.\u201d Fiedler recalled asking one of the SS men if he felt any remorse for murdering the Poles\u2026. \u201c I asked one of the SS men if he didn\u2019t feel bad about shooting women and babies. The man was smoking a cigarette, and said, \u201cThe Polish nation must be exterminated. I don\u2019t care about them.\u201d  The Soviets  Colonel Teske, a staff officer of German general Model during the battles that surrounded Warsaw, proclaimed after the war that.. \u201cThe Warsaw Uprising was the beginning of the Cold War between East and West.\u201d While the Poles were fighting and dying in Warsaw, the uprising became a central issue for the allies. In the Kremlin, Stalin considered the uprising to be of the utmost importance to his geopolitical ambitions in Central Europe, and demanded daily reports on the fighting delivered to him personally. Indeed, the Soviets had initially called for the Poles in Warsaw to rise.. Fight The Germans! No doubt Warsaw already hears the guns of the battle which is soon to bring her liberation ... The Polish Army now entering Polish territory, trained in the Soviet Union, is now joined to the People's Army to form the Corps of the Polish Armed Forces, the armed arm of our nation in its struggle for independence. Its ranks will be joined tomorrow by the sons of Warsaw. They will all together, with the Allied Army pursue the enemy westwards, wipe out the Hitlerite vermin from Polish land and strike a mortal blow at the beast of Prussian Imperialism. \u2014 Moscow Radio Station Kosciuszko, 29 July 1944 broadcast However, this proclamation was not met with great enthusiasm by the Poles. The Soviets were also known as brutal occupiers, and an important factor that led the Polish leadership to call for the uprising was the fear that the Soviets would quietly stamp out the Polish resistance and claim their supremacy over the Polish capital, or worse, falsely claim that the AK had collaborated with the Nazis. In the west, Polish political and military leaders communicated this distrust to the allies. General Wladyslaw Anders, Polish general in the Western front, told Winston Churchill.. \u201cWe cannot trust Russia since we know it well, and we know that all of Stalin\u2019s declarations that he wants a free Poland are lies.. As they enter Poland they disarm the soldiers of the Home Army (AK), they shoot dead our officers and arrest our civil administration, destroying those who fought the Germans continuously since 1939 and fight them still\u201d To which Churchill answered, \u201cWe will not abandon you and the Polish will be happy.\u201d It was this very promises that would be tested, and ultimately shown to be hollow The date of the uprising was initially decided by the Polish AK when it was confirmed that Soviet tanks had reached the nearby town of Wolomin by late July. However, the Germans launched a ferocious counter attack, pushing back the Soviets 10 km. The fighting in this sector east of Warsaw was brutal, but the Soviet numerical superiority was without question. In addition, Soviet positions south east of Praga (district of Warsaw east of the river Vistula), were not repulsed, and were merely 10 km away from the city center on the west bank. It was from here that the Poles expected the Soviets to seize Praga and send in supporting units, but the Soviets stopped, halting their advance for 45 days. While the Soviets and Germans were fighting fiercely over the bridgeheads to the north and south of Warsaw, the sector bordering Praga was defended by the weak and demoralized 73rd infantry division, which was destroyed previously by the Soviets on the eastern front. Indeed, the Germans were shocked that the Soviets did not attack Praga at an early date. The operations journal of German 9th Army on 16 August 1944: \u201c Contrary to our expectations, the enemy (Soviets) has halted all of their offensive actions alongside the entire front of the 9th Army (German army in Warsaw Uprising).\u201d The Soviets were also empty handed in other forms of aid, and failed to execute any airlifts during the early and intermediate stages of the uprising, even though the Soviet fighters could have easily dominated the German air presence over Warsaw. Likewise, the Soviets also blocked British and American planes from landing in Soviet airbases after dropping supplies in Warsaw. \u201cStalin might not have wanted to take the city itself, but he certainly could have shot down the German JU-87 bombers that caused so much damage; he could also have knocked out the airports and railway stations, blasted the Karl Mortars, the Panzer trains, multiple rocket launchers and tanks, and generally caused chaos for the Germans; he could also easily have created an air bridge of supplies and weapons in those early days when the Poles had controlled so much of the city. Instead, from August 1, Soviet aircraft were forbidden to fly over the Polish capital, with the exception of reconnaissance planes from the 16th air force, and even then, only the most politically trusted pilots were given permission to do so.\u201d While the Soviets were engaged in battling Germans around Warsaw, Stalin\u2019s lack of initiative regarding the Polish capital itself is best understood in considering his political aims. The destruction of the Nazi Germans was in reality only a short term goal for the Soviet leader. His ultimate goal was Soviet power asserted over Central and Eastern Europe, and the destruction of the Polish underground state at the hand of the Germans only served that purpose. Despite the previous Soviet and allied propaganda calling for an uprising, Soviet deputy foreign minister Andrey Vyshinsky refused to go along with the western allied airlift campaign, and is quoted: \u201c the Soviet Government \"could not go along\" with US plans to airdrop arms to resistance groups in Warsaw and that the \"action in Warsaw into which the Warsaw populations had been drawn was a purely adventuristic affair and the Soviet Government could not lend its hand to it.\" Indeed, Soviet policy was in harmony with its earlier mandates several months before, which made the Polish AK (the largest anti Nazi resistance in Europe), \u201cillegal\u201d, in favor of the Soviet formed communist Polish Committee of National Liberation. At the beginning of August, as the flames of the uprising had just ignited, Stalin proclaimed during a ministry of Defence meeting.. \u201cThe Polish Committee of National Liberation was created and will form is own administration. Keep in touch with this committee. Do not recognize any other political authority on Polish territory.\u201d The Soviets take Praga  On the 29th of August, as the Old City was crumbling, Stalin decided to make plans for the Soviet takeover of Praga, the Warsaw suburb on the East Bank of the Vistula. Stalin still did not offer any help to the Polish AK on the other side of the river. Plans were made to take Praga by the 10th of September, though it is widely agreed that the Soviets could have secured the eastern suburb between the 10th/14th of August. The attack was to be carried out by the 70th and 47th Armies, the 9th Guards Tank Corps and the 1st Polish Footsoldier\u2019s Division of the Kremlin controlled Polish Army. The Soviet and Polish forces greatly outnumbered the defending Germans in Praga, who were now very demoralized. On the west bank of the Vistula, the Germans were also on the the brink of panic, as they believed that the Soviets would soon cross the Vistula and aid the Poles. Looting increased, and the number of trains heading west out of Warsaw with stolen Polish possessions topped 300 a day. The Germans began pushing ever more fiercely to cut off the Polish AK from the Vistula river bank and secure the bridges leading to Praga. Stalin chose the 1st Polish Army under General Zygmunt Berling to spearhead the attack on Praga. The \u201cBerling\u201d Army, which numbered 60,000 men, was in large part composed of Poles from the eastern Kresy region in modern Ukraine and Belarus. Most of the troops were simple peasant folk conscripted into Soviet ranks. Nevertheless, the Berling men had proved themselves worthy fighters in brutal battles across Belarus.  Berling and his Poles were an important propaganda pawn in the hands of Stalin. Their existence was used to combat claims that the Soviets were in fact reoccupying Poland, and to show that a \u2018free\u2019 Polish Army existed within the Soviet Union. Berling, himself not a Communist, believed that by staying on the good side of Stalin, he could ensure that his nation would not become a Soviet puppet after the war. When the Soviets blamed the Katyn massacres on the Germans, Berling remained silent about the truth, even though he was almost murdered there himself by the Soviets in 1940. The 6,000 men of the 1st Polish Army at Praga were eager for a fight, and wanted to liberate their capital. The opening moments of the initial assault were recalled by one Polish soldier, \u201cAt a quarter past 11 all field radio stations and telephones released the order to prepare artillery fire. At the same time we heard both the Polish and Soviet batteries: \u201cZa Warszawe! Ogon!\u201d- \u201cFor Warsaw! Fire!\u201d- and hundreds of cannons blasted\u2026 One of the Polish leaders was mortally wounded. His last words were \u201cGo for it!\u201d. The Germans were hit by Katyusha rockets, blasted by artillery, their mines and barbed wire taken down by sappers. Polish and Soviet tanks rolled across the German defenses, as Polish footmen charged, chanting, \u201cWe the first, will enter Praga first!\u201d German soldier Gustav Borg recalled: \u201cAn unending thunder can be heard-it increases with every kilometer, soon houses are shaking. Gigantic flames appear over the eastern horizon, like a forest bending before a storm. A curtain of shells rush up towards the sky. It has begun.\u201d By the 13th of September, many German soldiers were in panic. One Praga resident recalls, \u201cBy morning the German troops were panicking. We could see small groups of Germans running towards the river in helmets\u2026 they were fleeing.\u201d Letters from captured German POWs in Praga also testify to the lack of German resolve. \u201cThe war will pass, the most important thing for you to is to stay alive\u2026 just stay alive.\u201d By the 15th of September, Praga was completely in Soviet hands, and the units of the first Polish Army were praised for their performance. In particular, the Kosciuszko division was singled out for its bravery, \u201cIn the fights for Praga the 1st division of Berlings Army, led by Colonel Bewzyuk, fought from the first to the final moment of the attack\u2026 They all wanted to be the first to enter Praga\u2026 The soldiers mood was very battle hungry and optimistic. Officers and soldiers constantly repeated that no matter the cost they want to be the first to enter Warsaw.\u201d On the first night Soviet and Polish Berling soldiers danced with each other, drank Vodka, and embraced in celebration. Yet the truth was not as rosy as it looked from the outside. The NKVD took over the former German barracks at Remertow, converting it into their headquarters. They began to round up suspicious Poles immediately. Any Poles suspected of belonging to the Polish AK were rounded up and herded into Special Camp No.10, where they would be imprisoned and later sent to the Gulags of Siberia. The Collapse of Czerniakow  Now that the Soviets had secured Praga, the Germans desperately had to subdue the AK fighters in the district of Czerniakow, which was the last Polish held Warsaw suburb that bordered the Vistula river. The Germans were certain that the Soviets would launch a concentrated offensive across the river in order to aid the Poles, and they were determined to prevent such a scenario at all costs. Czerniakow was well defended, though the Poles were low on ammunition. The defenses were bolstered by 500 elite fighters from the Old Town, who were by now the most experienced street fighters in Warsaw. At first, the weary fighters were able to relax in the peaceful surroundings of the quiet neighborhood. Yet, as always, this was only temporary. Even before the fall of Praga, the Germans began concentrating fire on the area. On the 11th of September, the Germans launched an overwhelming barrage of concentrated fire upon Czerniakow, flattening buildings and churning up the many gardens that graced the area alongside the river bank. On the 12th of September, the Germans started their offensive. Dirlewanger was ordered to assault the insurgents from the north. His troops, combined with the forces of other German commanders, vastly outnumbered the Polish AK. Despite a Anglo American proclamation that AK soldiers were to be treated as POW\u2019s under the Geneva Convention, Dirlewanger remained true to form, and murdered anyone he saw as \u201csuspicious\u201d. All young men were shot without distinction. Dirlewanger pushed his men forward into the Czarniakowski port, the gasworks on Ludna street, and the St. Lazarus hospital. By the end of the day, the entire district was surrounded and cut off. The following day German infantry supported by two tanks and two armored cars pushed the Polish AK into defensive positions at the Social Insurance Office Building. Dirlewanger moved into the charred skeleton of the St. Lazarus hospital, murdering all the surviving patients, and then launched a furious attack upon the gasworks. It was then that the massive bridges that spanned the wide waters of the Vistula river were blown. The horrified Germans immediately knew that could mean only one thing: The Soviets had conquered Praga. While the Germans trembled, the sight of demolition was a morale boost for the weary Poles. Finally, it seemed help might arrive. One AK soldier recalled.. \u201cZojda called me over, \u201cCome and see! You won\u2019t ever see anything like this for the rest of your life!\u201d The columns of the Poniatowski bridge, around three hundred meters from our positions, are moving - suddenly they fall into the river with a loud crashing sound.\u201d An overjoyed Wlodzimierz Rosloniec recalled his view from the roof of the Peking building, \u201cPeople are standing around. And then a large explosion. A fountain of water shoots high up in the Vistula and then, suddenly, the central part of the Poniatowski Bridge crashes into the water.\u201d The demolition of the bridge greatly pleased Bor Komorowski as well, who was previously considering surrender. Now, in the minds of the Poles, was the time to fight like tigers, holding onto every inch of ground with every last fiber of strength in their bodies, Finally, there was hope. The Germans felt the increased Polish stamina through the barrels of Polish rifles. A counterintelligence report from the German 9th Army reported: \u201cThe will to fight in the AK has found renewed strength because of the Red Army in Praga and they hope for help.\u201d On the 15th of September, the 146th Panzer Grenadier Unit, was repulsed by the AK fighters, suffering heavy losses. While Dirlewanger had managed to take a small factory on Wilanowska street, his losses were mounting rapidly and his offensive ground to a halt. The Polish defenders gathering in Ludna street, and traveled via a network of deep tunnels connecting strategic buildings, which the Germans bombed relentlessly. \u201cLudna 7 was hit, and the entire building caved in, burying over fifty people in the rubble; the Poles worked all night to put out the fires, but there was no water and the victims perished. The Germans put the massive residential buildings at Solec 20, 20A and 22 under heavy fire, but as they moved in to attack the Poles, who had not yet fired due to lack of ammunition, suddenly began to fire out of the windows. The Germans retreated in a panic. Fighting carried on late into the night. The gardens at Szalkowa, near the viaduct of the Poniatowski bridge, were filled with ripe fruit, tomatoes and vegetables, but lay in no mans land. At night Germans and Poles crept out to gather food, hoping not to bump into one another in the darkness; from time to time bullets ripped through the gardens.\u201d By the 14th of September, most of the Polish forces were desperately fighting with their backs to the Vistula river, as the Germans ever increasingly encroached. The Polish fighters took up positions in strong buildings, including the riverside garages and cork factory at the back of Ludna and Solec streets. The Germans labored by night, drilling holes into basements and roofs in preparation for the next offensive. The Poles were suffering terrible losses. \u201cRadoslaw\u201d Mazurkiewicz, the local Polish commander of the \u201cKedyw\u201d battalion reported the dire situation of his unit; \u201cI lost all officers. After three days there are around one hundred dead, three hundred wounded, and I am only able to maintain my position only because in the last three days we attacked at night - we have twenty POW\u2019s, although this is not very helpful. We are exhausted, cut off and have no help. We have about 10 bullets for each machine gun, twenty for submachine guns, and 50\u2013100 for light machine guns, so we can maintain our position until morning and then there will be a tragedy-or a comedy?\u201d The next day was worse: \u201cThe German attacks are stronger and stronger and the fact that we survived today I can only describe as a miracle. I have about 150 exhausted people\u2026 the fact that we are here without help, ammunition or connection with the outside world has a very bad effect on morale\u2026 The Germans are penetrating very deeply. They are trying to cut me off from the river. They are putting pressure from the western area. Today, on one section I had eight attacks, each supported by tanks and a hurricane of fire of mortars and the Luftwaffe\u2026 I will wait for a miracle or the fact that tanks will kill the rest of my people.\u201d His notes provide vivid moments of the fierce combat: \u201cA tank opened fire and the Germans attacked under its cover\u2026 Kryst, posted on the first floor balcony, greeted them with grenades. Several Germans fell and the rest retreated. A body remained lying in the middle of the street. At great risk and against my explicit orders, one of our girls, Irys, crawled out of the cellar window to get his rifle and ammunition. She was in luck.\u201d Despite the heroics of the Poles, it was apparent that they could hold no longer until aid was given. In a last attempt to call for help, Radoslaw sent a messenger across the Vistula with a request for Soviet aid. On the 14th of September, the Poles were shocked to see Soviet fighters attacking German aircraft over Warsaw. After the Soviets cleared the air, PO-2 planes began flying low over Czerniakow, dropping much needed ammunition, weapons, food and medical supplies to the desperate insurgents. In total, the Soviets dropped 50 tons of supplies. There was one problem, however. The Soviets did not use parachutes\u2026 \u201cOne AK soldier made eye contact with the pilot who dropped a load next to him on the shore of Czerniakow. It was filled with \u201cKasza\u201d, or buckwheat, but the canister broke, and the food became mixed with sand.\u201d \u201cJanusz Zawondy watched as \u201ca beautiful new Soviet long barrelled anti tank rifle bent into a pretzel when it hit the ground.\u201d The overwhelming majority of the supplies were destroyed on impact with the ground, and were of no help to the AK. While the drops were criticized by the Polish leadership, many Poles took it as a sign that the Soviets were at least making some attempt to help the rising. More tangible help arrived on the 15th of September, when an officer of the Polish 3rd Infantry Division of Berling\u2019s army arrived at AK HQ, informing the fighters that Polish troops would be arriving from the east bank of the Vistula river. At 4:30 AM on the 16th of September, 300 soldiers of the Polish 3rd infantry division crossed the Vistula in boats, unnoticed by the Germans. With them they carried fourteen machine guns, sixteen antitank rifles, five anti tank guns, and eight mortars. The two groups of Poles, one of the AK and the other Soviet, greeted each other like brothers in arms. It finally seemed as if the rising could succeed. During the day another 900 Berling troops, later followed by 1200 more, attempted to make the crossing. However, this time the Berling Poles were spotted by the Germans, and massacred before they reached the west bank of the Vistula. General Stanislaw Komornicki watched the slaughter: \u201cFrom the riverside escarpment you can see by the glow of the fire boats pushing off on the other side of the river. After a while the water is illuminated by the light of the German missiles\u2026 German mortars burst and splash into the water sending fountains jetting high into the air. The glare of searchlights moves over the water showing soldiers struggling to overcome the currents. Almost every boat is spotted by a searchlight. Heavy machine guns and cannon spray them with bullets. One hears the dreadful cries of injured men. Wrecked boats plunge into the depths. The heads of men swimming emerge here and there. Only one boat reaches the bank we are waiting on. It is bullet ridden and starts sinking.\u201d The German 9th Army daily report read: \u201cFrom midnight we have an attempt at a Soviet landing to the center of the Banditen defence\u2026 Thanks to the immediate use of strong fire from heavy weapons at the correct moment, which was already known, the enemy could not force the river.\u201d As later crossings were attempted by Berling\u2019s men, the AK in Czerniakow became very worried. The crossings were poorly executed, and the Polish 3rd Infantry Division was seemingly being used as cannon fodder. As German planes swooped down and shot at Polish boats, the Soviet air force did not lift one finger to clear the skies over the Vistula. Soviet artillery was mostly silent, and the Germans were allowed to freely strike the Berling men without having to worry about Soviet counter strikes from across the river. The surviving Berling troops, though very brave and spirited, were simply not prepared for the twist and turns of urban combat, and fell in droves: \u201cCompared to us they were really well armed - to the teeth\u2026 but they had no experience in street fighting. Very often, despite their heroism, they were wounded or killed.\u201d \u201cThey were brave, but were not used to the conditions of the city. They were essentially boys from remote villages for whom the maze of rooms, staircases, basements and attics was well as top floor extensions was a novelty. They had experience fighting in the open, not in the \u201cRattenkrieg\u201d of urban warfare.\u201d However, on the 18th of September, yet another miracle seemed to take place in the skies over Warsaw. Dozens of American B-17 flying fortresses were soaring above Warsaw, dropping supplies and weapons to the beleaguered Polish fighters. At last there seemed to be some hope. However, this again was a false hope, as the Poles could only helplessly watch as over 80% of the packages drifted out of reach into areas held by the Germans. The airlift ironically helped the Germans, giving them a boost in goods and supplies. As the Americans were dropping supplies over Warsaw, the Germans ever more fiercely attacked. On the 18th, they attacked Okrag 2, a Goliath obliterating the front of the building, burying dozens of people. They secured the tin meat factory and crane factory behind Wilanowska street, and Polish civilians were fleeing in panic. As the Germans advanced, they lobbed grenades into the cellars, killing the wounded who lay there. On September the 19th, Berling\u2019s Poles had begun to escape across the Vistula, while Radoslaw ordered the Polish AK into the sewers yet again. This time, the passage way through the sewers were even more difficult to traverse. By late August the Germans had realized that the Poles were using the sewers as a means of escape, and had planted mines and barbed wire within the passage ways, while German soldiers fired through the entrances, slaying anyone who survived the traps. Dozens of Polish fighters met their pitiful ends like rats in the smelly dampness of the sewers. \u201cIt was very difficult to pass through, as there were barriers of barbed wire; the Germans had mined the route and were firing into the passages.\u201d Small pockets of stubborn Polish resistance remained inside the buildings smack against the Vistula bank, and the remaining AK soldiers, along with some Berling men, fought with great courage and stalled Dirlewanger. By the 22nd of September, the Poles had decided to break out, with wounded being brought to the river bank to wait for evacuation. Some of the Poles who were dressed in captured German uniforms managed to cross through German lines unnoticed and make it to the Polish controlled City Center. Tadeusz Targonski recalled the moment as the German soldiers marched deeper into Czerniakow: \u201cgrowing clatter of catepillar tracks, hoarse shouts of drunken Germans.. tanks are approaching and right behind them the fascists with the sleeves of their uniforms rolled up are advancing en mass. We are aware that nobody is going to help us anyway. All of Czerniakow is ablaze in front of us\u201d Lidia Kowalczyk Strzelecka was escaping from her house to the river bank: \u201cOutside was terrible. Everything is destroyed. The cellars are full of people, patients, civilians and soldiers. They were unsettled, there was not enough air. It was physically and psychologically unbearable for a healthy person.\u201d The Germans immediately began to perpetrate the typical crimes. One woman recalled: \u201cThey kicked me in the stomach and took my mothers gold watch. I heard them enter the second room and execute all the patients there.\u201d \u201cThe Germans pushed on into Solec street in a wave of brutal killing. Dirlewanger\u2019s men raped and murdered 122 people in the paint factory at Solec 53; twelve of them died by hanging. One victim was the preist Jozef Stanek, chaplain of the Krynski battalion, who was hanged with his own cassock.\u201d The worst fate awaited the hundreds of civilians who, pressed by the German advance, crowded alongside the sandy Vistula river bank in hope of rescue. By the 20th of September, the river bank was overcrowded. Some attempted to swim across the river, but were mostly cut down by hails of German bullets or drowned due to the strong currents. Those trapped alongside the river bank could see freedom across the water, but had no way to cross. Zbigniew Rylski recalled: \u201cI could see hundreds of people along the bank who had managed to get there, either on their own or they had been carried. Many were calling for help or for water-it was so crowded that the badly wounded were stepped on.\u201d Some Poles swam to the nearby abandoned river boat, \u201cBajka\u201d, for refuge. The riverboat was half sunk near the shore, and people swam there to escape German bullets. \u201cIt was like a scene from Dante. The boat was covered in dead bodies, and the wounded were calling for help. The people lying there could not defend themselves. The boat was under German fire, with rockets lighting up the sky.\u201d On the beach, the Germans were only kept back from the masses of civilians by occasional Soviet fire, which at times hit the frantic Poles who were caught in the crossfire. The Germans responded by throwing grenades at the refugees on the riverbank. Some people attempted to use the drowned ruins of the Poniatowski bridge to help escape to the other side, but the Germans opened fire with machine guns and rocket launchers. Non of the escapees survived. On the night of the 21st, the Poles tried signalling for a hundred boats to evacuate the mass of civilians and AK on the beaches. Instead, that night, the Soviets only sent twelve. Two hundred soldiers and civilians were hanging onto the \u201cBajka\u201d, but more than half of them died during the crossing as many of the boats were shot and sunk, and some disappeared under the strong currents. On the final rescue mission on the 23rd, out of twenty five rescue boats, only eight made it back to the eastern shore. Those left behind tried to swim across, but the current drove many into the hands of the Germans. They were killed. In contrast to the Polish plight, the Germans were uplifted, and relieved that they had subdued the Poles in the last place where the Soviets could have sent aid across the river. The 9th Army was delighted to report: \u201cafter heavy fights lasting the whole night Berling\u2019s defence was broken and the southern cauldron taken, the last house with eight two Polish legionaries and fifty seven Home Amry soldiers, thirty five killed.\u201d The surviving civilians were being transported to Pruszkow, from which they would be brought to concentration camps across the Reich. Other groups of prisoners were rounded up and directed to burn the bodies of the Polish dead in piles consisting of hundreds of bodies. Czerniakow had become a ghostly skeleton of collapsed buildings and burnt out cellars. German Leutnant Peter Stolten recalled: \u201cFrom these buildings that have not already been completely destroyed we take sculptures, sofas and tapestries. Everything will be burned soon. Already most things are demolished. We are stuck up to our knees in equiptment, rubbish, pieces of crockery, and dirt.\u201d Stalin\u2019s Cynical Game The battle of Czerniakow was a clear message to the Poles in Warsaw that they could not rely on the Soviets for aid. Not only had Stalin stalled any action of support for the uprising when it was most needed, but he had also toyed with the AK fighters, sending them just enough aid to make them believe that a large scale Soviet offensive was about to be launched across the Vistula, and then dashing their hopes once the need was most dire. The AK in Warsaw was to be left to the mercy of the German war machine. Hitler would do a service to Stalin by cleaning up the rebellious Poles who would otherwise be a very inconvenient thorn to Stalin\u2019s side. Stalin was also playing a double game for the western allies. By sending seemingly substantial but in reality ineffectual aid, Stalin could claim that he did in fact aid the uprising, while in reality tending to his ambitious goals concerning Central Europe. He could also derail the Polish insurgents as \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201cadventurists\u201d, who initiated the uprising without regard to the civilian population of the city. There were some in the west who accepted this propaganda. However others, such as the well known George Orwell, defended the Poles and exposed the hypocrisy of the allies. \u201cI want to protest against the mean and cowardly attitude adopted by the British press towards the recent rising in Warsaw. ... One was left with the general impression that the Poles deserved to have their bottoms smacked for doing what all the Allied wirelesses had been urging them to do for years past,. ... First of all, a message to English left-wing journalists and intellectuals generally: 'Do remember that dishonesty and cowardice always have to be paid for. Don't imagine that for years on end you can make yourself the boot-licking propagandist of the Soviet r\u00e9gime, or any other r\u00e9gime, and then suddenly return to mental decency. Once a whore, always a whore.' George Orwell, 1 September 1944 The Germans Press On By now the Poles had absolutely no chance of victory. Nevertheless, the Germans were still faced with more brutal fighting, and the Poles still held strategic districts within Warsaw. The 9th army was preparing for the final push that would finally vanquish the stubborn Poles. Indeed, the Himmler and Von Dem Bach were desperate to finish off the Poles as quickly as possible, and were humiliated that the Poles had held them back for so long. While the Germans were set at ease by the Soviet inactivity, they frantically aimed to destroy the Poles in the district of Mokotow, which had access to the Vistula river and was across from Soviet troops. The use of the regular troops in the form of the 19th Panzer division was authorized. Mokotow was once a wealthy suburb graced with rich villas and marble clad apartment buildings. While it was spared the worst of the uprising, it became the target of German shelling from the beginning of August, and soon the district began to reflect the horrors of the Old Town. On the 24th of September, Stukas filled the air sending death to Polish soldiers and civilians alike, and a massive barrage of mortars pounded the district from the south and west. German tanks advanced through the streets, and Goliath\u2019s blasted gaping holes into buildings and barricades. The assault had begun. In defiance of the German pressure, the Poles fought with exceptional valor and tenacity. Fighting to the last man, the AK managed to repulse German tanks in numerous points, with exceptionally intense fighting on Niepodlegosci avenue. The German Army Group Mitte reported that.. \u201cThe attack from the south came up against isolated insurgents\u2026. their defence was very fierce. Our forces are not concentrated enough or supported enough by artillery\u2026 tomorrow there must be a concerted attack on one point-artillery must shoot precisely, this is the only way we will be successful in such street fighting.\u201d German SS General Von Dem Bach showed his desperation in his military journal\u2026 \u201cThe Azeris do not attack. Mokotow will not be successful. The Muslims and such do not attack. Rohr has enough soldiers but no artillery.\u201d By now, the Germans had changed their policy towards the Polish civilians in an effort to win them over so that they could garner Polish support in fighting the Soviets. In accordance with this new policy, Von Dem Bach declared a ceasefire in which Polish civilians could evacuate the district. Many Poles decided to stay behind in fear of murder at the hands of the Germans, but many other civilians decided to evacuate to the Germans in an effort to escape the relentless bombing and terror that was the battle of Mokotow. Over 9,000 civilians left Mokotow and were transported to Pruszkow concentration camp. Von Dem Bach declared that, \u201cIn the future Poland and the German Army will fight together against the Bolsheviks.\u201d The Poles of course, were not fooled. Meanwhile, in Mokotow, the morale of the AK plummeted with the absence of so many civilians. The Germans renewed their assault and brutal fighting errupted inside key buildings and across barricades. The Germans had the upper hand. On September the 27th, the Germans attacked the AK from all sides, and panic was mounting within the Polish ranks. The Poles were again forced to evacuate into the sewers, as all hope for Mokotow had vanished. The passage through the sewers was chaotic and terrifying, with scenes worthy of depictions of hell. Germans bombed the tunnels, shot into the gratings, lobbed grenades into the portholes, and poisoned the passages. Some AK troops emerged from the sewers, only to find themselves in German held territory. \u201cOne of the worst incidents took place at Dworkowa street, where filthy and exhausted AK soldiers emerged into the sunshine expecting to helped by their colleagues, when in fact they had come up in German held territory. Each man was pulled out quickly, so that he would not have the time to alert those behind him. 140 were shot by the Schutzpolizei.\u201d \u201cOthers got lost underground, and many bodies were recovered after the war;forty two at Agrykola, thirty two under Pohorosy, eight under Zagorna. Still, more died because of booby traps, grenades, mines and typhoon rockets. Some reached what they though was freedom, only to find themselves trapped by iron grills and bars from which they could not escape.\u201d  (AK soldier as he finds that he has fallen into German hands. He was later executed) Mokotow had fallen, yet the several hundred AK soldiers who had managed to escape through the sewers were now preparing to defend another suburban district, Zoliborz. From mid September on wards, Zoliborz was subjected to relentless bombardments, and civilian losses were high. Eyewittness accounts recall the horrid scenes that could be seen in Zoliborz. \u201cAmong the ruins of the Warsaw Cooperative Housing Colony, the grotesquely positioned corpses of woman and children lay in bomb craters. Other bodies hung from the balconies. Even the once lush green trees of Zoliborz were now uprooted and entangled with the dead.\u201d Hunger ravaged the defenders and civilians alike, and medical situation was a complete crisis. \u201cHunger is written all over their miserable grey faces. Many people have had nothing in their mouths for several days. The lamentable state of children cries out for help. In these smelly damp holes around 25,000 people live in the open air. The lack of water and medical care spreads illness and death.\u201d On the 28th of September the German 19th Panzer division surged into Zoliborz, with fierce fighting raging at all points for almost two days. At the convent of Plac Wilsona, Polish snipers managed to inflict heavy losses on the German attackers, and halted the infantry advance. The Germans responded by sending fighter planes and Goliaths to wipe out the fortification. In short succession, the 19th Panzer division struck the Polish barricades without any warning, methodically destroying AK held buildings and positions. It became clear to the Poles in Zoliborz that further resistance was futile. The supreme commander of the Polish forces sent a message from the City Center, giving permission for Colonel Mieczyslaw Niedzielski to surrender at 630 PM on the 30th of September. The Poles surrendered to the regular German army, and were spared execution. Instead, they were treated in accordance with the Geneva convention. Zoliborz was lost. Now only the City City Center remained in Polish hands. The City Center and the Polish Capitulation The City center, or Srodmiescie, lay at the very heart of Warsaw. It featured tall apartment buildings, narrow winding streets, and dozens of offices and theaters. The Polish positions were divided into by the German held Jerusalem avenue, but the AK was able to maintain communications and movement due to the construction of a complex network of tunnels that ran under the German positions. The important district was made up of people from every stratum of Polish society, including factory workers, civil servants and artists. Cultural life had carried on during the fighting, with plays and poetry recitals taking place in the public halls. A field power plant generated electrical power for hospitals, radio stations, and even the pump for a deep water well. The same area was the center of AK propaganda, where AK newspapers, films and handbills were produced. The City Center had so far been largely untouched by the ravages of the uprising, though fierce battles raged on its outskirts from the first weeks.Some of these engagements became enshrined in AK legend. One of the most remarkable of these engagements took place at the ten story complex of the Central Telephone exchange on Dzielna street. Its mock medieval tower was used by German snipers to great effect, and became the target of Polish assaults. Around 200 German troops were surrounded and trapped inside, as the Poles threw fire bombs and launched assaults against the structure. The Germans fought fiercely, believing that the Poles would murder them upon capture. Some German soldiers lost their nerve and committed suicide. One soldier, Kurt Heller, recalled\u2026 \u201cThe Poles have moved in to drive us away with fire and bottles of benzene, and a terrible stench was rising up from the bodies lying on the street\u201d One the last day he wrote that the Poles had surrounded them; he feared that he would end up in a mass grave in the courtyard.\u2019 On the 19th of August, the Poles pumped oil and petrol into the basement and set it on fire, forcing the Germans to the upper floors. Polish AK fighter Zbigniew Debski recalled the intense assault.. \u201cFrom above they (the Germans) threw grenades on us, fired with submachine guns. We conquered, in turn, the second and third floors. The Germans had hung a yellow distress flag on the side of the building, but no help came.\u201d When the Poles reached the top floor, they discovered that the Germans had used a small spiral staircase to flee to the boiler room downstairs, where they were trapped an finally surrendered\u2026 \u201cWhen we let them put their hands down and we gave them cigarettes, some of the old Wehrmacht soldiers cried like children and cursed Hitler and the war. All the German soldiers became PoW\u2019s.\u201d Despite the Polish successes in the City Center, the German mar machine would not give the Poles any mercy. Karl mortars, Stukas and Krowa all rained death upon the shocked inhabitants. In addition, tens of thousands of refugees from Wola and other Warsaw districts had crowded the City Center, creating a health crisis. Especially devastating were the constant air attacks, which claimed dozens of Polish lives. AK soldier Zbigniew Debski recalled\u2026 \u201cAt that moment the Germans directed Stukas against my building. All my dear friends died under the debris. I had known them from secondary school\u2026 I was hurt and buried under the rubble.\u201d Another eyewitness recalled that.. \u201cBuildings disappeared from the top down, chunk by chunk or blown to smithereens by one direct hit.\u201d Mass starvation also ravaged the civilians of the Old Town, which was after Czerniakow crowded with over 200,000 traumatized refugees. Dr. Wronowski recalled\u2026 \u201cthe condition of the refugees is terrible, especially as they have no food. The kitchen which was used to work has stopped because there is no water. Famine has started.\u201d Drought had become so unbearable that.. \u201cWhen it rained for a short time in September people knelt on the ground, spoon in hand, taking rainwater from puddles and poured spoon after spoon into cans and dishes.\u201d Life in the cellars became horrendous.. \u201cPeople face the loss of everything, even their lives, in the rubble. They are starving an ill, and add lack of electricity which means everything is done in the twilight of primitive lamps and candles, in the crowds reading is impossible, people talk constantly, there is no water so people cannot wash.\u201d \u201cWe were depressed as we realized it was our turn this time. There was no false bravado. Everyone feared the Krowa, and the air attacks. We just could not survive.\u201d The weather was getting colder.. \u201cNights were now very cold. People have lost their belongings, blankets are taken for the wounded patients. The ruins and basements are freezing but they cannot make a fire as people would die of smoke inhalation. Some try to make fires in the courtyards but this is dangerous because of bombs and shells.\u201d Fist aid posts were overwhelmed, and doctors performed operations by the light of an old torch or candles. The floors were slippery with blood, and there was a severe shortage of medical supplies. The wounded died in droves. Graves were dug in parks or under the pavement, only for bombs to churn them up again. Morale broke down, and social unrest skyrocketed. Civilians not only blamed Stalin and the allies, but also the AK for the uprising. The conditions in which they lived were barely human. The desperate humanitarian crisis led the AK leadership and supreme commander Bor Komorowski, to one conclusion. Continuing the fight would be exceptionally cruel and merciless, and would cause the deaths of countless more civilians. Negotiations with Erich von dem Bach ensured that Polish civilians would not be subjected to mass murder and abuse, and that Polish AK soldiers were to be interned as POWS protected under the Geneva convention. Between the 1st and 2nd of October, ceasefires allowed thousands of civilians to evacuate out of the city center. On the 3rd of October, the Polish soldiers marched to hand their weapons to the enemy. They marched in ranks, tired, bloody, devastated, but proud. After years of humiliation, murder, and dehumanization, the Poles of Warsaw had struck against their occupiers. Abandoned and forgotten by the world, this army of young boys and girls took on the full wrath of the German war machine for 63 days. In contrast to earlier actions, the German troops did not murder and abuse the AK prisoners. Indeed, some Wehrmacht officers saluted.  Aftermath The fighting in Warsaw was some of the fiercest and most intense in the entire war. While the military casualties of the battle are not as extensive as those in battles fought between conventional armies across the eastern and western fronts, it is important to remember that the the Warsaw Uprising was the largest underground revolt undertaken against the Germans during the entire world. The uprising took a massive amount of planning, and the ability of the Poles to adapt and utilize whatever resources they had at hand. The fight for Warsaw was truly three dimensional, with fighting ranging between buildings, along streets, within cellars and basements, in between rubble, and even the damp darkness of the city sewer system. Around 15,200 AK soldiers were KIA, with an additional 5,000 WIA and another 15,000 taken captive. Over 5,000 members of the Polish 1st Army were killed during the crossing of the Vistula and the battle of Czerniakow. The Germans lost between 9,000\u201317,000 KIA, and 9,000 WIA. What makes the Warsaw Uprising stand out however, is the massive civilian casualties. Around 200,000 Polish civilians were killed during the 63 days of fighting, with close to 100,000 being murdered directly by the SS. The mass bombings of Warsaw killed tens of thousands more, and largely flattened the once proud city. Tens of Thousands of Polish civilians were sent to concentration and death camps across the Reich, while more were relocated across various regions of the General Government (German occupied Poland). Several thousand civilians and AK soldiers managed to hide from the Germans in the city ruins, and fought for survival in the face of freezing temperatures, starvation and lack of shelter. After the Germans won the city, they systematically destroyed every building with flamethrowers and explosives. Warsaw was to be totally destroyed, and all vestiges of Polish culture and history were to be erased. Between 85 to 90% of the city was completely leveled. According to Generalplan Ost, the Polish nation was to be totally eliminated, and all traces of their presence was to be eradicated. Hitler planned to create a massive lake on the location of the capital. Luckily, his deluded plans were never to be realized.  (Warsaw 1950)  (Colorized aerial footage of the ruins of Warsaw) Poland was spared the wrath of Nazi ethnic policy, but still did not gain her freedom. In the place of Hitler, Poland fell under the iron handed grasp of Stalin, and was lost behind the Iron Curtain. The heroes who had fought against the Nazis for years as part of the AK, were now hunted down, imprisoned, sent to gulags, and in many cases shot by the Soviets and the Peoples Polish Republic. They met their deaths in dark dungeon cellars, their last words unheard by the world, their cause forgotten. In the west, the free world was eager to forget the nation that they had gone to war to protect, but failed anyway. The enormous contribution of the Polish nation to the allied war effort was quietly shelved in favor of the big three. The hundreds of thousands of Poles who fought during the battle of France in 1940, Narvik, the skies of Britain, the wide spaces of the Atlantic, the deserts of North Africa, the hills of Italy, the eastern front and the allied invasion of France, suddenly became a marginalized footnote in history. The only allied nation to be not invited to the allied victory parade in 1945 was Poland, even though she contributed the 4th largest allied army in the fight against Nazi Germany. Poland was repressed, defeated, ravaged and destroyed. But her spirit was not yet dead. Out of the ashes, her children rose again and again, their inner fire at times waning, but never going out.      Only decades later, Poland could finally say she was free. This hard won freedom is not one the Poles of today will easily abandon. The flames of the ruins of Warsaw still live within the Polish hearts, the sacrifice of the forgotten heroes was not in vain. And Poles will continue to love their homeland and fight for it, no matter what they are called or how they are misunderstood. This is why every November the 11th (Polish independence day), Poles gather in Warsaw and countless other cities across Poland to commemorate the sacrifice of these heroes who were never able to see their country free.

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of potential answers to this question - after all, the term \u201cbrutal\u201disn\u2019t exactly one with a very strict definition. What appears to first pop in the eyes of many when thinking about the brutality of a battle is often the sheer size of the battle itself and of the means deployed in it - the battle where the most men fight and die, the most bullets and shells are fired, ect, leading to battles like Stalingrad, Berlin or Kursk being chosen in WW2 and the Somme or Verdun for WW1. In my eyes, though, the most brutal, violent, hard-fought and inhumane battles weren\u2019t necessarly those though. To me, the ones which fit the words \u201cbrutal\u201d the most were the battle of the late Pacific War - if I had to pick one in particular, Peleliu, but pretty much all of them fit the bill.  Marine LVT(A)-1 (left, armed with a 37mm gun in a turret similar to the M3/M5 Stuart) and LVT(A)-4 (right, armed with a 75mm howitzer in a turret similar to the M8 Scott) at Peleliu, 1944. Amphibious support vehicles, particularly when armed with either 75mm howitzers or flamethrowers, were particularly helpful against entrenchened Japanese infantry. There are many reasons why those fit the word brutal in my eyes, but there is one key one which is why they are even more than Stalingrad to me. In the battles of the late Pacific War, such as Peleliu, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, the Japanese had their backs against the wall: the US Navy had acquired total naval superiority after Midway, Guadalcanal, and Leyte Gulf, and once the American landed, it was only a matter of time before the island fell: the Japanese garrisons couldn\u2019t retreat, receive reinforcements or even supplies. The Americans not only had the advantage of simply having logistics, but also overwhelming support from air, sea, and armor. In nearly every battle of the Second World War, when soldiers were in a \u201cbacks-to-the-wall\u201d situation, out of supply, isolated and with no hope of escape of victory, most of them surrendered. Even against their ideological nemesis, even against an enemy that treated them very poorly, few chosed \u201cdeath over dishonor\u201d, if you want to call it that. In the gtreat encirclements of 1941, the USSR generally lost much more soldiers that were captured than soldiers that died: 600,000 captured to 100,000 KIA or missing at Bryansk, 300,000 captured to 186,000 KIA at Smolensk, ect. In February of 1943, when the 6th German Army surrendered at Stalingrad, out of the 210,000 Germans that had been surrounded in Stalingrad (there also were 60,000 Romanians, Hungarians and Italians), 105,000 were taken into captivity, and \u201cjust\u201d 60,000 had died (35,000 had been evacuated by German aircrafts, about 10,000 continued to fight even after the capitulation). During the battle of Berlin, while up to 100,000 German military personnel were killed, up to 480,000 were captured. Even when fighting their ideological nemesis, after a war full of war crimes and that had caused the death of millions on each side\u2026 ,most soldiers would still rather surrender and live than hopelessly resist and die.  Columns of Soviet soldiers captured during the battle of Kiev, 1941 The Japanese, however, were different. As clich\u00e9 as that sounds, when they had their backs against the wall and had fired all the ammunition they had\u2026 they\u2019d much rather fix bayonets and charge in than be taken into capivity. They just didn\u2019t surrender. In the 1930s, after the control of Japan\u2019s institutions had eventually drifted from the political parties to the military, the old Japanese honor code, the Samurai Bushido, was extensively put back at the forefront of Japanese society to support and fuel the increasingly militaristic militarism of Japanese society. The training of Japanese soldiers included not only military training (often very mediocre in comparison to European or American standard), but also moral standing - it would be hard to say ideological, as Japanese soldiers were taught to have utmost loyalty towards the emperor more than towards any ideology. The old Bushido code, which put honor before life and stated that those who had lost their honor could regain it by ritual suicide, was used to fanaticize Japanese soldiers and ensure that they would rather die than surrender and dishonor themselves, their famillies and the empire. In practice, that translated by Japanese soldiers preferring using suicidal tactics, devoid of any consideration for their life, rather than surrender. This naturally was quite the shock for the troops that faced them - such fanaticism is something which may have been hard to imagine. During the battle of Peleliu, the American faced a force of 10,900 Japanese soldiers. Out of this total, 10,695 were killed and just 19 - there is no 0 forgotten, it\u2019s 19 - captured. The rest continued to use unknown positions and to scavenge to survive and occasionnally engage US troops (A Lieutenant leading 34 surviving soldiers surrendered, to a Japanese admiral, as late as April of 1947) In my eyes, though, the brutality of those battles comes not only from Japanese fanaticism, but also from the nature of warfare and the weaponry used - which often came from the very fanaticism of Japanese troops, to be fair. In comparison to their US equivalents, the Japanese garrisons were vastly underequipped: Japan\u2019s production capacities were much lower than that of the USA. The Japanese lacked tanks; some of the more equipped garrisons did have some Type 97 Chi-Ha and Type 95 Ha-Go, but by 1944, those had grown vastly outclassed by American Shermans. While the infantry-carried Type 89 \u201cknee mortar\u201d often proved to be a nasty surprise for US troops, the artillery advantage was otherwise vastly to the US: American units had more gun, which were on average more modern, and had way more shells per gun. Not only that, but they had the overwhelming firepower of the US Navy at their disposal, as well as carrier fighter-bombers such as rocket-armed F4U Corsairs. Even going into individual firearms, Japanese infantry critically lacked submachine-guns, their Arisaka rifle, while reliable, were ageing, and their machine-guns usually inferior to their American counter-parts, not to say rarer. There was only a single advantage the Japanese really had - they had been there for little more than two years, and since they had arrived, they had been digging in. Deep. Various tunnels, caches and hiding places were all over islands when American marines landed. All those had to be meticulously reduced, in short-range, intense combat. Even when trapped in a bunker or cave with no way out, Japanese troops wouldn\u2019t surrender - and the only reliable way to take them down while minimizing casualties for the Americans were flamethrowers.  A Sherman M4A3R3 \u201cZippo\u201d firing a burst of flames at Iwo Jima. The flamethrowers used in armored vehicles had longer range when compared to the M2 flamethrower of American infantry, and were therefore less vulnerable. Nonetheless, Japanese soldiers did not hesitate to charge American tanks and place Type 99 anti-tank magnetic mines on the vehicles; despite a chronic lack of potent armored vehicles and anti-tank gun in Japanese garrisons, American tanks suffered considerable losses: 221 tanks at Okinawa and 137 at Iwo Jima. Flamethrowers were very extensively used in all battles of the late Pacific war; carried by infantry or mounted in armored vehicles (LVT-4 Buffalo, M5 \u201cSatan\u201d, M4 \u201cZippo\u201d), they were more often than not the only reliable way to take down entrenchened Japanese infantry. By 1944, each Marine regiment had 81 flamethrowers. Those operated in tandem with BAR machine-gunners; while the automatic fire was used to suppress Japanese positions, flamethrowers could advance, bring the enemy position within their very short range, of about 30 meters. The same process had to be repeated over again, and again, and again, for nearly every Japanese positions; in many ways, the battles of the Pacific War ressembled guerilla warfare more than regular full-scale war, with Japanese troops harassing an overwhelming enemy and relying on hidden and fortified positions which the US had to stumble upon, and then reduce at point-blank range. Not only was the process slow, tedious and exhausting for the assaulters, it also caused huge casualties to them - nowhere near as much as the defenders, but much more than, say, the regular warfare of the western front would with similar number of men engaged. The Pacific War\u2019s battles were also marked by their incredibly savagery and violence that characterized them. The bodies of killed American soldiers were often mutilated and then put in plain sight to make sure their comrades would see them. In a photo I\u2019d frankly rather not have seen, the severed head of a dead soldier had been placed on a knocked out Japanese tank; the legend stated that the bomb had been trapped with explosives, in order to kill American soldiers that may have wanted to remove it to, for example, give it a proper burial. On the American side, mutilation of Japanese war deads was commonplace. While, when people think of war trophies nowadays, they image grandpa coming back home with an enemy pistol, in the Pacific War, the trophy more often was a teeth or even a skull of a Japanese soldier - a combination of viciously racist propaganda against the \u201cJaps\u201d and brutality of the combat had entirely de-humanized Japanese soldiers to the eyes of the Americans. In short, way more than on any other front, mutilation of captured bodies was commonplace, and the opposing forces were often not given proper burials. A number of vicious tactics were also used: Japanese soldiers would sometimes pretend to surrender, only to detonate with a grenade when American soldier approached them (which had the side effect of making any potential surrender even rarer, as American troops would sometimes fire on soldiers appearing to surrender).  American soldiers posing with skulls of killed Japanese soldiers. While absolutely unthinkable in Europe, pictures of Allied personnel smiling and laughing around human remains kept as trophies are commonplace in the Pacific. A last, but definitly not least aspect in making the battles of the Pacific hell on earth for all that were involved was the environnement. In pretty much all aspects, the Pacific islands on which the battle were fought were vastly unsuited for large armies to be properly maintained and were very vulnerable to disease, particularly malaria spread by mosquitoes. This had been somewhat foiled by US troops, which had been issued necessary medical supplies after having had very bad experience with disease in the battles of 1941 and 1942, but the Japanese garrisons had very little to protect their own soldiers. Worse, once US ships blockaded the islands, receiving not only medical supplies, but even food or drinkable water, became almost impossible. As the battles went on, Japanese soldiers were constantly declined health. They were not helped by the terrible living conditions within tunnels, where temperatures often exceeded 40 to 45 degrees celsius and obscurity was, outside of the most complex and extensive ones, nearly permanent. Many Japanese soldiers died from diseases and starvation, causing immense pain in the proccess. Local populations, caught in the crossfire, also suffered massive casualties both from collateral damage, starvation, and, particularly in battles on more Japanicized islands such as Iwo Jima and Okinawa, suicide: anti-American propaganda had been running rampant in Japanese populations, and Japanese citizens expected rape, torture and murder from the invaders: they often preferred suicide over occupation. In Okinawa, US soldiers witnessed piles of civilian bodies at the bottom of cliffs, many having preferred death in the local population. This combination of factors made the Pacific islands absolutely horrifying battlefiels - for US forces of course, but even more for their Japanese opponents, which suffered not only from all the horrors of war, but also from absolutely disastrous sanitary conditions and food or water supplies. While none of the various battles of the Pacific reaches a level of casualties even remotely close to battles such as Stalingrad simply because of the much smaller number of men involved (the largest Japanese garrison, in Okinawa, was comprised of about 96,000 men), I don\u2019t think any battle larger than a tiny skirmish in Europe had any ratio of casualties even remotely similar to the ones of Japanese troops in the Pacific battles: At Okinawa, the battle in which most surrendered, just 7,000 Japanese military personnel were taken prisonners, and up to 150,000 civilians - half of the island\u2019s population - died or went missing. At Iwo Jima, on upward of 21,000 Japanese troops present, just 216 were taken prisonners. At Tarawa, 4,700 soldiers and labourers were killed, with 129 labourers and just 17 soldiers been taken as prisonners. Japanese soldiers which neither died nor were captured in the main battles often continued to fight until they were eitheir killed or long after the war was over: the last Japanese soldier to surrender, Hiroo Honoda, held out in the Philippines until 1974. US Marines and Army casualties, while far lower in proportion, were still some of the heaviest suffered by America on any front: At Okinawa, out 183,000 combat troops at the beginning of the battle and 250,000 at its peak, US suffered from 12,000 combat deaths, up to 14,000 to 20,000 deaths total when including those caused by disease, and 38,000 to 55,000 woundeds. At Iwo Jima, out of about 110,000 personnel, including non-combat troops, about 6,800 were killed and 19,000 wounded.  Japanese soldiers charging towards American lines at Okinawa. The famous \u201cbanzai charges\u201d, named after the Japanese war cry \u201cTenno Heika Banzai \u201c (Long live the Emperor), were generally performed when Japanese troops were backs to the wall, about to be completly overwhelmed by enemy forces; those mass human wave attack, an alternative to ritual suicide with a similar ending intended from the start, occasionnally managed to reach American lines, but more often than not, were entirely cut down by automatic fire before they could engage in close combat. The battles of the Pacific were not only costly, though, but also incredibly long; the very slow nature of the American\u2019s troops advance when facing a myriad of well-hidden, fanatically-defended Japanese divisions led to absurd amounts of time being needed to capture relatively small islands: At Okinawa, 2 months and 3 weeks were needed from the landing to the reduction of the main pocket of resistance, on an island of about 1,200km2. It gets even more ludicrous with Iwo Jima, where one month and a week were needed for an island of 21km2, and Peleliu, where 2 months, a week and five days were necessary for an island of merely 13km2. And even then, those battle duration only account for the reduction of main resistance pocket: sporadic skirmishes with survivors continued in pretty much all captured islands all the way up to the end of the war, and sometimes even later. When looking at the absolute sluggish bloodbaths the invasion of various small islands accross the Pacific had been, it isn\u2019t hard to imagine why the Atomic Bomb was such an attractive option when compared with an invasion of Japan. I won\u2019t get into the debate of what was right to do in 1945, but I\u2019d recommend you to just imagine how bloody a campaign on the soil of mainland Japan would have been, when facing not such isolated garrisons, but a fanaticized population which had, in 1944 and 1945, fallen even deeper into fanaticism and suicidal tactics, with weapon system designed purposefully for its user to suicide such as the Kaiten torpedo and Okha flying bomb enterring production. By 1945, Japan was also forming massive militias out of its population, blurring the distinction between civilians and military personnel. An invasion of Japan would have faced not just regular soldiers, but millions of civilians often litterally armed with sticks, and for many of them ready to die if it meant bringing Americans tot he grave with them. It wouldn\u2019t have been pretty, at all.  Japanese women of the \u201cVolunteer Fighting Corps\u201d (Kokumin Giy\u016b Sent\u014dtai). At first named volunteer corps in March of 1945 and intended to be unarmed, the newly formed Japanese militia quickly shifted toward a more active role: if the allies were to land in Japan, they were not only to perform construction duties and support frontline troops, but also serve as second-line units and perform guerilla warfare behind enemy lines. Between June and August of 1945, 2 million Japanese civilian were taken into the Volunteer Fighting Corps: the militia could theorically incorporate any physically able man between 15 and 60 and single woman between 17 and 40: a total of 28 million of \u201ccombat capable\u201d individuals. While existing photos more often than not show the militia training with Type 30 or Type 38 Arisaka rifles, in practice, most would only be armed with swords or bamboo spears. Coupling chronic lack of armament, lack of sufficient military training, and extreme fanaticism to potentially kamizake extent, the casualties suffered by the Volunteer Fighting Corps in combat would most likely have been enormous.
