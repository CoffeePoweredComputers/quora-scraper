            "answer_text": "The National Socialist movement was broad based, in German Speaking Europe. And its racialist, xenophobic, and ethnocentric nationalism, was broad based as well. Remember, Hitler himself was Austrian, and his anti-Semitism was Catholic in origin. Similar to the profound anti-Semitism of Catholic Poland and Hungary. The German anti-National Socialist movement was always an insignificant minority within German speaking Europe. Made up mostly of the disbanded Lutheran aristocracy. And the right-wing snobs who had no interest in fiction of melding and fusion of the upper, and lower classes. Therefore the Nazis as such, in fact were, German nationalist sentiment. A sentiment that animated the whole (German) people, to unite the German speaking family, to seek territorial cohesion, ethnocentric purity, and a Jew free Europe. (note to the censors: I am describing truthfully the german people's sentiment of the time. That must be accurately stated for what it was and what it meant to both be; and do.) ",
