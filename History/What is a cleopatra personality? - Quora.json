            "answer_text": "If you are talking about Ancient Cleopatra then the best answer would be a strong and intellectual person since she had a knowledge of different political ideas in Ancient Egypt. If you are talking about the Shakespearean Cleopatra in \u201cAnthony and Cleopatra\u201d by Shakespeare then her personality would be very Shakespearean. Examples would be very theatrical in all of her actions and could fit the term of show off. Hope this helps. ",

Needles to say Cleo and I never had much time alone after he showed up. We went skinny dipping in the Nile one night, but I never administered the MBTI tho. She was too ADHD to complete it anyway. But if you press me I'd guess ESFP. She threw a good party but would go on forever about all she did and how she made the humus dip and lamb chops. Boring \u2026 ",
