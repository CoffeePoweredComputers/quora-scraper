            "answer_text": "Hi, a top or best shoes depends not only on high-fi quality or brand of shoe. Your type of foot also matters a lot. Guess the type of your foot and size first, then go for the top shoe. Whether your foot is of a high arch or normal, wide feet or narrow, or any bunion type problem, plus a sort of work or place you Wanna put them on. As my feet are wide, so I always search for the best shoes for wide feet. Such shoes must have an open to or wide toe area. In-office I always prefer formal type which must be extra cushioning, so that I can work for long easily. Yes, Thanks to different awesome detailed based review sites make my query relating a question, suits you as well, \u201cwhat are the top shoes with wide feet, or shoes with a high arch, etc.\u201d Anyhow, after NIKE, I guess Sketchers and Newbalance are quite at the top.
