            "answer_text": "No. Because, first of all, time dilation isn\u2019t everything in a an area slowing down in velocity. For those in the effected reference frame, they don\u2019t see anything slowing down. It\u2019s those outside that reference frame that see the accelerated one slowing down, which is another physical example of the fact that time is real. Since time is interwoven through space into the space-time continuum, what you do to space, also eventually happens with time. Another physical proof that time is real is high frame rate photography. In fact, if time wasn\u2019t real, photography wouldn\u2019t even work. This Slo Mo Guys video shows the physics behind frames rates, light and velocity, which are all connected to time.  ",

            "answer_text": "The reality of time can be deduced and understood with cognitive faculties. When we are conscious, every new information that arises brings new experience. We compare new experiences with past experiences giving existence to a past. When you anticipate, you create a future. Time is dependent on consciousness in reality. Humans are clever and noticed that the day turns to night and make up weeks. Weeks turn into months and months into years, while years slowy become a lifetime. We used our solar system to develop a system of keeping track of time. Keeping track of time has enable us to organize and cooperate simultaneously, growing out civilization. There are planets with different revolutions and orbits that would be like different time. There may not be a universal time independent of a conscious mind.  Humans shouldn't ignore time but utilize it wisely and practically! Remember time runs out and your can't be conscious forever, enjoy life! Good day! ",
