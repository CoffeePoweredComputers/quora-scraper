            "answer_text": "It emphasizes that the two natures (human and divine) of Jesus Christ were joined by will rather than personhood and appears to reject the concept of Him being both God and man (hypostatic union). Because the Nestorian view also embraces areas of Mariology, this implies the belief that Jesus\u2019s sacrifice alone on the cross was not sufficient to redeem mankind from sin. However, according to God\u2019s Word, Jesus is both perfectly divine and perfectly human. He was foreordained before the foundation of the world. But regardless of any theology, the real focus should be: Does the teaching that an individual ascribes to, agree with biblical scripture as inspired by the Holy Spirit?The spiritual condition of the individual- does he/she have a true relationship with the real Jesus of the Bible, or Is the person just being religious?It\u2019s the heart, not the mind, of the matter 1 Timothy 2:5; 1 Corinthians 3:11; John 1:1\u20134; 2 Corinthians 11:4; 1 Peter 1:18\u201320; Romans 8:16; 1 John 5:6 Romans 3:23; Romans 6:23; Romans 5:8; Acts 3:19; Romans 10:9-10; Nestorianism - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "The correct teaching of Christianity is that Christ has two natures; human and divine. The Nestorian view is that Christ has two persons with his human personhood being absorbed by his divine. The problem with that is that makes Christ into a demigod not God the Son. If affects their theology in a dangerous way and leads them away from the True Christ. Nestorianism was condemned by the Council of Ephesus in 431. This means the Nestorian\u2019s, Christ didn\u2019t suffer as God and die for the sins of the world. That somehow, like the Muslim view, Christ was able to be removed from the suffering (only Christ\u2019s divine person), cross and ultimately the death so that he can rise up in the resurrection. And this means that Christ would only resurrect as a human (not as God) which under true Christianity would not be sufficient. So this creates another Jesus and another gospel which Paul warns us about in the book of Galatians: Galatians 1:6-8 New American Standard Bible (NASB) I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel; which is really not another; only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed! ",
