            "answer_text": "Because History is factual. Take the game of Baseball for example, You know these guys. The hitting team is in the dugout chewing wads of bubble gum, relief pitcher getting ready by practicing. This usually indicates to me at either the pitcher is sucking, or the contrary he's had a no hitter but it's the 7th inning and he looks tired. So slowly walks the pot bellied coach to the mound , says a few words and in come the reiref pitcher. Well there are million things that can happen in baseball and there's a RULE for every weird thing that can -- and oh by the way it happens more often than you think! Baseball is presented in history by recorded factual data and it has a great history. All facts have been recorded: play by play, error by error, inning by inning and player by play. All data is recorded and never erased. I't's a great sport, icluding the umpire and referees. Assistant coaches are always nearby to give their funny coded messages to players when a hot play is about to begin.The pitcher begins the game and his catcher figures out the kind of ball the pitcher will pitch by motioning fingers to the pitcher, until the pitcher nods indicating \u201cthat's the one coming\u201d. It could be a fast ball, a knuckle ball, a slow ball, and countless others. The type of pitch a pitcher decides on all depend on the type of hitter on deck, and how many players are on plate, and Which plate are they or he on, as well. He also has to watch out for plate stealers so a pitcher has a lot on his mind so to speak. They're usually very lean and tall with longish hair.  The pitcher pitches from a mound of dirt -- IF ITS THE 7TH INNING ALL SPECTATORS RISE AND SING \u201c Take me out to the ball game *youtube it if you don't know it. ITS A FUN SONG. The game is played on a diamond. The ball is fast real fast, and it's fun to watch guessing what the next move could be . There are brawls, insults hurled, players that are famous for stealing bases, funny slippery balls, pitchers that are super great and can throw no hitters in a game, slugglers, and as I said before fast plays double plays, triple plays, walks usually but not always a pitcher allows a tough slugger to walk cuz if there are men in base chances are he'll make a home run along with all men on base, on the other hand these are one of the nerve racking decision the pot bellied manager makes He walks over slowly to the mound *this is also a mental strategy to slow down the opponents momentum. So manager gets there catcher's present plus a few other key players team is caught in a catch 22, Manger decides to take a chance, and let the pitcher pitch to great slugger (who knows slugger can choke poor make that homer. And the whole game gets really tricky when there's at least one on base, worse if hes at 2nd , and really shitty if the guys on 3rd, and happens to be a stealer or not even a stealer. In baseball though, errr softball what you see it what you get. You just get the game at a bit of a slower speed. I've seen men play Softball, the pitch is thrown underhand unlike Baseball. Still  Softball is very popular and enjoyable. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question indeed. Lots of human experiences have been lost through countless time and space dimensions. An ordinary Aztec man\u2019s one day in June 24th when he was 22 years old was never written anywhere, and we won\u2019t likely ever know what it was like. The rest of history can be thought of as such. Even contemporary history has many fuzzy parts, yet alone the classic history! However it\u2019s abnormal to record every breath of all human at all the places all the time, unless you\u2019re the Big Brother of an Orwellian Thought Police. History is a synthesis of facts, hearsay evidence, claims, myths, frauds and even rumors. And in our age of IT revolution and burst of information load, it\u2019s way too easy to manipulate history and keep certain facts obscure, and eventually hidden. One great example is the atrocities and war crimes conducted by the Allies like massacres by Communist Russia or even the universally well-known Hiroshima & Nagasaki A-bombs that have been manipulated as such to represent that such carnage was the \u201cnecessary evil\u201d, but it wasn\u2019t. Yet because scant evidence survives about it, and even such evidence are ignored, unpublished, unspoken of and un-debated, they fall out of \u201cmainstream\u201d and gradually fade away, while alternative interpretations with specific sponsors who are ready to buy many thousands of copies of books to make it a bestseller and hence, make the public read it; will survive and ultimately be held as the true account of what happened. Eventually, the true versions sometimes end up in the trash bin of history, and cleared away from the collective memory of the society. And it\u2019s no wonder years later so many people deny such things as Allies war crimes\u2019 very existence, or happening at all! ",
