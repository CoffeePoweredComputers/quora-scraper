Captain Cook and his men were seen as  the arrival of the Hawaiian god Lono, their god of prosperity.  Hernan Cortes was believed to have been seen by the Aztec king Moctezuma as  the arrival of god Quetzalcoatl. The Korowai  apparently saw the white man as demons, called white skinned ghost demons, with removable skin (that means shirts) who will destroy their last and current (the 5th) world created by their creator. What does this have to do with anything? People make use of their mythology to interpret things they see for the first time.  ",
