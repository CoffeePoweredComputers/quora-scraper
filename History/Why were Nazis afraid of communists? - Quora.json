            "answer_text": "Communists and Nazis hated each other because they fought for the same grazing land. Both leveraged the same set of strengths they considered their unique virtues: An extremely divisive narrative \u201cus against the world\u201d that enforced cohesion and aggressiveness.Agenda of violent wealth redistribution from \u201cthem\u201d to \u201cus\u201d.Totalitarianism as a principle of government. Both wanted a full eradication of dissent. Both required from everyone their full commitment not only of their life and property, but also their hearts and minds.The requirement of full obedience and unquestioned acceptance of the ruler and all his decisions.Collectivist mindset. Subjugation of individuals to the tribe/class.Deep contempt for mercantile professions and Capitalism as a whole.Militarism and the heroics of self-sacrifice.Shared base among lower classes and marginalized members of the middle class.Two ideologies of radical justice can impossibly exist side by side. Once they take shape, they immediately start a war of annihilation. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Below, a Nazi propaganda poster that could be reworked into a Communist one in just a few quick touches. It weaves a plain militaristic and collectivist narrative, where all classes march together under the red banner of radical justice against their common enemy: financial plutocracy, Communist Jewry, non-Arian barbarian hordes, and liberal degenerates. Beside the text, the only thing that makes this piece of propaganda different from Communism is the swastika. It draws the line of mortal combat between Germans and non-Germans\u2014not between classes of the same nation, as Communists would have it.  ",

            "answer_text": "Completely false question. The Soviet Union was the main ally of Nazi Germany from the time when Hitler came to power until June 22, 1941. Soviet Union and Nazi Germany cooperated in starting World War II in September 1939, and jointly invaded and partitioned Central European countries, and cooperated in mass executions and expulsions of people of those countries. Hitler eventually invaded every ally that he had: Hungary, Italy, Finland, and the Soviet Union. Why don\u2019t you ask: Why did the Nazis hate fascists so much? \u2014 Nazi Germany invaded fascist Italy, after all, eventually. Wikipedia provides a reasonable review of the nazi-communist collaboration, including outright love and mutual admiration when they held joint military parades after the success of their September 1939 joint military invasion of Poland, here: Germany\u2013Soviet Union relations, 1918\u20131941 - Wikipedia Makes you wonder: Why did nazis loved communists so much (when they served their purpose)? Note, in Wikipedia, the information about the 1940 meeting in Moscow, after the Soviets provided badly needed supplies for Germany to enable the German invasion of France, when Germany told the Soviets that a pre-condition for continued successful cooperation was for the Soviet Union to restrict their territorial ambitions to the areas to the South of the Soviet Union (effectively pushing them to fight against the British Empire). Historically, this is what happens after Russia and Germany cooperate: They murder and destroy everything that stands in their way, and eventually face each other \u2014 then they end up at each other\u2019s throats. The only cooperate when they are separated. As is the case now. ",
