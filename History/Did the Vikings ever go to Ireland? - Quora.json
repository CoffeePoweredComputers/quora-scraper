            "answer_text": "Not only did they go to Ireland but they stayed. They built or started some of the major cities/ports on the island. They inter married with the locals (sometimes in quite a forceful way). They left their genes and names. Technically they were defeated in 1014 at clontarf (it only took 200 years to put them in their place) but really by that time they were just another Irish tribe or clan and they stayed and continued to influence and trade with the locals and the rest of Europe. Christchurch cathedral was started by Silkbeard the viking king of Dublin in 1030 (I thought they were defeated). ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Dublin, Carlingford and the recently discovered site at Anagassan were all Viking settlements. The Vikings influence in Ireland was broken by Brian Boru at Dublin in 1014. However the public story and the real story are often at odds. There was already plenty of intermingling between Danes, Norwegians ,Irish by that time,..Viking ing was already 200 years old by that time. ",
