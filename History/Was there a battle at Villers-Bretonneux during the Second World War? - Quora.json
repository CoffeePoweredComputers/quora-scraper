            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t imagine how long it took me to figure out this question. There were two battles at Viller-Bretonneux in May and June 1918, both won by the Allied powers. But I found no reference to conflict in WWII. I thought about this and the fact that you saw bullet damage at the Australian monument. I pulled out some maps and it occurred to me that in June 1940, the British and or French had to retreat over the general location of Villers-Bretonneux. So, I started looking for information about the retreat of June 1940 and found this rather detailed description of the fighting with maps and pictures (courtesy of Edward Lehman who posted it on 4 October 2004. The location of Villers-Bretonneux is directly east of the detailed descriptions herein provided. I can\u2019t imagine such intense fighting did not extend further to the east that the fighting described. Guderian crossed into France through the Ardennes and crossed the Meuse River at Sedan. This is east of Villers-Bretonneux. He or another German unit had to pass right through Villers-Bretonneux. My guess iis that the evidence you observed occurred during the French/British retreat in June 1940. I\u2019m using a tablet but my guess is that if you put the attached maps on a computer monitor you will get a better sense of the relationships of the various locations. I\u2019ve been in this location and I know much about both wars. I\u2019m sure there was no named battle at Viller-Bretonneux but the location had to be on the line of the 1940 retreat. Hope this helps. It is interesting reading in any event. MAY / JUNE 1940 THE BATTLE ON THE AISNE AND RETOURNE RIVERS IN MAY / JUNE 1940 On 13th May 1940, after having crossed the Ardennes, the XIX.AK (mot) from general Guderian crosses the Meuse at Sedan. The day after the French B series 55e DI (division d'infanterie) is crushed and on 15th May a breech is created between the French IIe and IXe Armies. The French high command tries then to create again a continuous front and urges reinforcements west of Sedan to try to stop Guderian. Among these units, the 14e DI (general De Lattre de Tassigny, future commander of the 1st French Army in 1943) is launched in the battle. At that time the division is mainly composed of : \u2022 35e RI (r\u00e9giment d'infanterie) \u2022 152e RI (r\u00e9giment d'infanterie) (nicknamed the \"Red Devils\") \u2022 3e demi-brigade de chasseurs o 2e BCP (bataillon de chasseurs \u00e0 pied)o 21e BCP (bataillon de chasseurs \u00e0 pied)o 31e BCP (bataillon de chasseurs \u00e0 pied) \u2022 25e GRDI (groupe de reconnaissance de division d'infanterie) \u2022 4e RAD (r\u00e9giment d'artillerie divisionnaire) \u2022 204e RALD (r\u00e9giment d'artillerie lourde divisionnaire) One uncommon fact is that the two infantry regiments have 1 platoon of 20mm Mle1939 AA guns each. MAY 1940 On 15th May, elements from the 14e DI (I/152e RI, II/152e RI, 2e BCP) defend several towns (la Bascule, Chagny, Bouvellemont, Mazerny, Wignicourt, Faissault). They destroy about 30 German tanks but they loose all their 25mm AT guns. These losses are not useless, they allow to delay the German tanks and give the time to the French units engaged during the previous days to retreat. More north the 53e DI cannot stop the 2.PzD and the 14e DI is ordered to pull back behind the Aisne river and to establish a defensive line (between Taizy and Attigny) with a bridgehead north of the Aisne river in the town of Rethel. Only on 17th May all the units of the 14e DI are in position and the 35e RI releaves the two battalions of the 152e RI heavily engaged during the 15th May. The I/152e RI and II/152e RI are put into reserve to recover near Annelles and Perthes between the Aisne and the Retourne rivers. The following battle on the Aisne river will last from 17th May to the 11th June. The 14e DI illustrated itself by resisting to all the German attacks and it even took some 800 German POWs during the month of June. De Lattre requisitioned many isolated troops from various units to strengthen his defensive line and the bridgehead of Rethel. The requisitioned troops included 3 replacement B1bis tanks from the 8e BCC (bataillon de chars de combat) (\"Villers-Bretonneux\", \"T\u00e9m\u00e9raire\" and \"Lun\u00e9ville\") under the command of sous-lieutenant Robert. After 5 days of combats (17th - 21th May 1940) these 3 B1bis tanks had destroyed 20 tanks, 9 armored cars, 12 motorcycles / side-cars, 10 cars and 16 trucks. sous-lieutenant Robert, 8e BCC Renault B1bis \"T\u00e9m\u00e9raire\" The two first main German attacks are launched on 17th May (mainly from the Domain Premium: 21.ID and Domain Premium: 23.ID but all the German assaults are defeated by the 152e RI supported by the 3 B1bis tanks. The Germans are reinforcing their troops and an other large scale attack, well supported by the artillery, is launched on 19th May. In front of the increasing German power, General De Lattre orders to move all the units south of the Aisne river but the 3 B1bis are ordered to hold the bridges of Rethel which could be blown only partially. The Germans try then to cross the river east of Rethel but are pulled back by a French counter-attack. On 20th May 1940 at 6h00, after a heavy artillery preparation, the assaults are renewed in Rethel and the German infantry manages to cross the destroyed bridges and to create a bridgehead south of the Aisne river. At 16h00 the I/152e RI and II/152e RI in reserve, supported by 2 B1bis tanks, lead a vigourous counter-attack and all the Germans are killed, pulled back or captured. General De Lattre himself declared that without the B1bis tanks the defense line would have been crushed : \"they were the striking hammer, the hunter in ambush, the armored knight charging the enemy. This young Robert, what a leader ! He did better than many colonels\". General De Lattre organized a tank recovery/repair workshop and requisitioned all what he could. Finally he managed to add 11 other B1bis tanks from the 8e, 15e, 28e and 41e BCC to support his infantry division. On 21th May the front is somewhat reorganized and it has an impact on the 14e DI's deployment : \u2022 the 25e GRDI is in reserve in Perthes \u2022 a second line is organized on the Retourne river from Neuflize to Alincourt with the II/35e RI reinforced by the XXI/15e RTA (attachement) \u2022 in Rethel the I/152e RI is replaced by the 2e BCP Concerning the B1bis tanks : \u2022 the \"Flamberge\", the \"France\", the \"Amiens\" and the \"Cantal\" are in Rethel, reinforcing the 3 tanks from sous-lieutenant Robert \u2022 the \"Jura\" is in Thugny-Trugny \u2022 the \"Trombe\", the \"Alsace\", the \"Mulhouse\", the \"Poitou\" and the \"Verdun\" are on the second line in Menil-Annelles \u2022 the \"Rhin\" is in reserve in Neuville Their primary mission is to defend the Rethel - Tagnon road including the bridge as well as the rail-road bridge in Sault-l\u00e8s-Rethel. On 20th May, the \"France\" is lost in Sault-l\u00e8s-Rethel. 1 or 2 men with civilian clothes launch incendiary grenades or Molotov cocktails on the tank which is put on fire. 1 member of the crew dies and an other is wounded. On 22nd May the Germans launch an other attack at 0h00, in Ambly-Fleury, but they are easily pulled back by the French MGs and the artillery and at 3h00 all is quiet again. The same day at 6h30 the B1bis tanks \"Cantal\" and \"Amiens\" defending a bridge on the road from Rethel on the Aisne river are engaged by a 8.8cm Flak18 or a 10.5cm leFH18 (according to various sources) which has been hidden in a house by the German troops during the night. The \"Amiens\" is hit on the track and immobilized. The \"Cantal\" is penetrated by 3 consecutive shells and the driver is killed. The \"Amiens\" fires back with the 47mm SA35 turret gun and destroys the German gun firing. On 25th May the XXI/15e RTA and 3 artillery groups are removed from De Lattre's command. The second line is then only occupied by several instruction companies from various regiments (3e RIC, RICM, 23e RIC and 46e RI). The front remains quiet until 9th June 1940. JUNE 1940 9th JUNE 1940 The German offensive is prepared for the 9th June morning. The XIII.AK and the XXIII.AK (Domain Premium: 17.ID , Domain Premium: 21.ID, Domain Premium: 73.ID and Domain Premium: 86.ID) are facing the French 2e DI and 14e DI. The Germans infantry divisions have the task to break the French lines between Ch\u00e2teau-Porcien on the west and Attigny on the east to establish strong bridgeheads across the Aisne river in order to enable the Panzergruppe Guderian to pierce deep in the French lines. This Panzergruppe is composed of the XXXIX.AK(mot) (1.PzD, 2.PzD and Domain Premium: 29.ID(mot), general Schmidt) and the XLI.AK (6.PzD, 8.PzD and Domain Premium: 20.ID(mot), general Reinhardt). The odds seems not in favour of the French troops. One anecdote is that the German artillery is reinforced by 5 French 220mm heavy mortars captured north of the Aisne, with 5000 shells. Ironically they will cause important losses among the French troops. FRONT OF THE 14e DI (east of Rethel) : from Thugny-Turny to Attigny The German assault (73. and Domain Premium: 86.ID) begins at 4h20 after a 35 minutes long artillery preparation. The http://170.IR (Domain Premium: 73.ID) manages to cross the Aisne river at Thugny-Trugny and begins to infiltrate in the French lines. The 31e BCP is very close to be encircled in the town. De Lattre sends colonel Paraire to counter-attack with elements from the 25e GRDI, the 2e BCP and 9 Renault R35 tanks coming from the 3e BCC. They pull the German regiment back inflicting them heavy losses. On all the front hold by the 14e DI the attack of the XXIII.AK is a failure. FRONT OF THE 2e DI : from Ch\u00e2teau-Porcien to Thugny-Turny (including Rethel) The 2e DI is attacked by the Domain Premium: 17.ID and the Domain Premium: 21.ID, leading to heavy street fights in Ch\u00e2teau-Porcien and the southern part of Rethel. No German bridgehead can be established, at each attempt the French troops launch a vigorous counter-attack that defeat the Germans. About 500 German POWs are captured by the 2e DI. During the afternoon two breeches will be opened and enlarged in the French lines. West of Rethel 6 assault groups from the http://3.IR (Domain Premium: 21.ID) crosses the river on a lock in Nanteuil despite heavy losses. This breakthrough allows the Sch\u00fctzen of the http://3.IR to take some hills south of Nanteuil and to cut the Avan\u00e7on-Rethel road. Immediately the engineers of the Domain Premium: 21.ID build a bridge over the Aisne to allow the tanks to cross the river. A second breech is made east of Ch\u00e2teau-Porcien which is now threatened to be encircled by the two breakthroughs. The front is broken in this area despite the resistance of the II/31e RI. The garrison in Ch\u00e2teau-Porcien will fight until being out of ammunition and surrendered only after violent close combats, delaying the building of an engineer bridge for about 6 hours. A counter-attack is rapidly organized with the 1st company of the 23e BCC (Renault R35 tanks), two infantry platoons and two dismounted cavalry platoons but it fails due to heavy bombardment from the German artillery and aviation as well as a very efficient anti-tank artillery destroying 9 from the 13 R35 tanks. At 7h00, the German have achieved a bridgehead south of the Aisne river, deep of about 5 km from Ch\u00e2teau-Porcien to Avan\u00e7on. The engineers build bridges for Guderian in Ch\u00e2teau-Porcien and Taizy. On 9th June evening there is an animated discussion between General De Lattre (14e DI) and General Klopfenstein (2e DI). The first one would like to mount an immediate counter-attack, being aware that the German tanks will soon spread from the bridgehead but the second one wants to retreat 3 km south and does it. General De Lattre is therefore forced to reinforce his left flank which is not covered anymore. 10th JUNE 1940 : the Panzergruppe Guderian crosses the Aisne river General List orders Guderian to cross with the tanks as rapidly as possible and at first an attack against Tagnon is planned for 22h00. All the issues and organization problems postpone the attack to the morning. Guderian wants first to increase the bridgehead to allow all the tanks to cross the Aisne river. The 1.PzD and 2.PzD have the task to strengthen the bridgehead while the Domain Premium: 17.ID and Domain Premium: 21.ID will launch an attack towards Perthes in the south-east of the bridgehead. This offensive should crush the left flank of De Lattre and force the French to abandon Rethel and move more east \u2013 south/east if they don't want to be outflanked and turned, leaving more space for ther Germans to cross the river. Guderian himself leads the operations from Avan\u00e7on and the offensive is launched at 5h30 after an intense artillery preparation. The French troops (2e DI) have created several strongpoints in the villages instead of a weak continuous line : the villages of Perthes, Tagnon, Le Ch\u00e2telet, Alincourt and Juniville as well as the southern part of Rethel will gave a bad licking to the German infantry regiments of the Domain Premium: 17.ID and Domain Premium: 21.ID. The tanks of Guderian can avoid the combat but the infantry is stuck on the French positions. The Germans reach Juniville at 9h00 and launch 3 assaults against the outnumbered but entrenched III/73e RI without any success. In Le Ch\u00e2telet the Germans fight against the 11e GRDI from 13h30 to 19h30. The French reconnaissance battalion is under the rubbles of the town that has been destroyed by the German artillery and aviation. At 19h30 they leave Le Ch\u00e2telet for M\u00e9nil-L\u00e9pinois and Warmeriville where they establish new defensive positions. The town of Alincourt fells in German hands only at 17h45 and finally at the end of the day the offensive is concentrated on Juniville which will be hold by the French battalion until 23h45. Tagnon and Perthes are encircled by the IR.55 and IR.3 at about 8h30. The IR.45 tries to infiltrate in the northern part of Perthes to attack the French troops in Rethel on their rears. The French troops will fight for each house. Only at 12h15 the Germans managed to enter in Tagnon but the street fights will last during 4 hours before they control the town. At 22h00 Perthes is conquered (but elements of the French 127e RI are still holding some parts of the town) and the southern part of Rethel surrenders late in the night only. On the front of the 14e DI, the whole XXIII.AK (Domain Premium: 73.ID and Domain Premium: 86.ID) launches an assault but again the Germans are pulled back everywhere by furious counter-attacks. The left flank is now facing the German troops from the XXXIX.AK(mot) (1.PzD, 2.PzD and Domain Premium: 29.ID(mot) but mainly the 1.PzD at the moment) and the XIII.AK (Domain Premium: 17.ID and Domain Premium: 21.ID). On this flank, the defensive position follows a line between Juniville and M\u00e9nil and it is defended by only 1 infantry regiment (the \"Red Devils\" of the 152e RI) and 2 reconnaissance battalions (10e GRCA (groupe de reconnaissance de corps d'arm\u00e9e) and the 60e GRDI) supported by a 75mm Mle1897 battery. The high losses inflicted to the German infantry divisions by the 14e DI and 2e DI create an opportunity for a more important French counter-attack. On 10th May morning, the \"groupement Buisson\" is the single unit able to lead a counter-attack in the area of Rethel. But it was south of the Retourne river and had first to cross it. The tanks reached their base line only at 14h00. At this moment the German bridgehead's size has already considerably increased. After refuelling, the unit is ready to attack at 15h00 but is only launched at 17h00. The French counter-attack is launched without artillery or aviation support. The movements of the \"groupement Buisson\" are spotted by the Luftwaffe and will be stopped mainly by the numerous guns installed in anti-tank role by the Domain Premium: 21.ID. The \"groupement Buisson\" is split in 2 parts : 1) One part which has crossed the Retourne river more on the east and will attack the Germans from an east / south-east axis : \u2022 Northern attack on the Annelles - Perthes axis (groupement of lieutenant-colonel Ma\u00eetre) with elements of the 3e DCR : 17 Hotchkiss H39 (2/42e and 3/42e BCC), 9 Renault B1bis (2/41e BCC) and the 3 infantry companies of the 16e BCP (bataillon de chasseurs port\u00e9s). \u2022 Southern attack on the Juniville - Tagnon axis (groupement of lieutenant-colonel Salani\u00e9) with elements of the 3e DCR : 25 Hotchkiss H39 (45e BCC), 10 Renault B1bis (1/41e BCC), and of the 7e DLM : reduced 31e RDP (r\u00e9giment de dragons port\u00e9s). \u2022 A few B1bis tanks from the 3/41e BCC remain in Annelles as protection and take not part to the attack. 2) One part south of the Retourne river, composed of the 10e BCC (40 Renault R35) and of the 7e DLM (division l\u00e9g\u00e8re m\u00e9canique) from general Marteau which will counter-attack on the M\u00e9nil-L\u00e9pinois - Alincourt - Le Ch\u00e2telet axis. The \"groupement Ma\u00eetre\" (26 tanks) includes these 9 B1bis tanks : \u2022 B1bis \"Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape\" (capitaine Gasc) \u2022 B1bis \"Aisne\" (lieutenant Hom\u00e9) \u2022 B1bis \"Yonne\" (aspirant Laval) \u2022 B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\" (sous-lieutenant Tuffet) \u2022 B1bis \"Durance\" (lieutenant Carraz) \u2022 B1bis \"Arlay\" (aspirant Thor\u00e9) \u2022 B1bis \"Bayard\" (sous-lieutenant Soulet) \u2022 B1bis \"Villers-Marmery\" (adjudant-chef Mar\u00e9chal) \u2022 B1bis \"Pinard\" (aspirant Bergeal) The French tanks crushes some German troops, reaches Perthes and inflicts heavy losses to the German troops of the IR.3 and IR.5 (Domain Premium: 21.ID). A German artillery barrage added to the direct fire of the 8.8cm Flak and 10.5cm leFH18 guns from the http://21.ID, reinforced by the Panzerj\u00e4ger-Abteilung 560 (8.8cm Flak), blocks the French advance, destroying 9 Hotchkiss H39 and 3 Renault B1bis tanks. The action is here described by sous-lieutenant Tuffet, commander of the B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\". The Hotchkiss H39 are progressing in front of the B1bis tanks. After having crossed a hill the H39s are engaged by very numerous AT guns and HMGs deployed behind and along a road. The 9 B1bis of the 2/41e BCC charge then against the German positions to cover the Hotchkiss tanks.With their 47mm turret guns and the 75mm hull gun the French B1bis tanks fire towards the flashes revealing the German AT guns' positions. With its coaxial MG lieutenant Tuffet kills a whole squad of German soldiers moving along the road. A bit later he destroyed 2 self-propelled guns (no information about the exact type).Many Pak36 anti-tank guns are firing on the B1bis \"Aisne\" which is hit many times but without effect and it fires intensively back. The B1bis \"Aisne\" reached the road, crushes some German soldiers and a Pak36 under its tracks and destroys a MG nest.The B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\" is hit by many 3.7cm shells, no penetration at all but the bad feeling of being a target. About every 5 seconds a 3.7cm shell is clicking against the armor. The periscope of the copula is destroyed. One bolt goes away and hits the helmet of the radio but without any injury. The B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\" fires with all its weapons while advancing in the German lines.Added to the German AT gun firing, the German artillery barrage is always more intense. Lieutenant Tuffet sees the \"Aisne\" and \"Yonne\" tanks firing on the enemy's position. On the left he spots an AT gun firing on the \"Aisne\" and he destroys it with is 47mm turret gun. A running German soldier is also killed with the coaxial MG. Suddenly a violent shock, the 47mm gun sight is destroyed and the turret is blocked. Through the episcopes lieutenant Tuffet sees the B1bis \"Yonne\" being abandoned and scuttled by its crew. The B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\" fires then only with the 75mm hull gun but a second very violent explosion neutralizes the 75mm SA35 gun too. The radio antenna is also destroyec. Unarmed, the B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\" moves back and recovers the crew of the \"Yonne\" which embarks thanks to the bottom hatch. Some equipments stored on the tank roof (blankets) are put on fire. The tank pulls back in cover and lieutenant Tuffet stops the fire with an extinguisher. It is about 20h30 and the B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\", damaged, moves back to the departure line in Annelles. Perthes is on fire and the German artillery barrage is still very intense.The B1bis \"Aisne\" is still advancing in the German lines and destroys a German infantry squad hidden in a field. A violent shock on the hull, a second one on the copula which destroys the binoculars. Lieutenant Hom\u00e9 is WIA and blind during several minutes. One fuel tank is also damaged and fuel is leaking on the floor. The \"Aisne\" pulls back in the French lines. It is more than 21h00, after more than 3 hours of combat.The B1bis \"Bayard\" has its turret MG damaged by a 3.7cm shell at the very beginning of the engagement. A 10.5cm shell penetrates the right side hull and 1 crew member is lightly wounded but the tank is still operational and destroys many AT guns before retreating to the French lines.From the 9 B1bis, 3 have been destroyed or abandoned (\"Yonne\", \"Durance\" and \"Arlay\"), 4 are damaged (\"Aisne\", \"Corbi\u00e8res\", \"Villers-Marmery\" and \"Bayard\") but returned in the French lines and 2 are still fully operational.All the surviving tanks are covered by numerous 3.7cm shells impacts that did not penetrate the armor. On the B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\" more than 100 3.7cm shells gouges could be counted. Destroyed/abandoned B1bis : \u2022 B1bis \"Yonne\" : under fire from 10 various AA/AT guns firing from the front and the left. The tanks destroys 5 of them but one German shell ignites a fire in the engine. It is extinguished but the tank is immobilized, the 75mm SA35 hull gun is therefore grossly useless. The tank continues to fire with the 47mm turret gun and the coaxial MG but one shell finally blocks the turret. The tank is scuttled and the tank explodes. The crew is safe and retreats in the French lines in the B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\". \u2022 B1bis \"Durance\" : destroyed by 10.5cm shells, the 75mm gun loader is KIA. \u2022 B1bis \"Arlay\" : destroyed by several 10.5cm shells, all the crew members are KIA The attack of the \"groupement Ma\u00eetre\" is led by the capitaine De Hautecloque (as known as \"Leclerc\", future commander of the famous 2e DB, the 2nd French armoured division), he walks in front of the infantry and the tanks with his famous stick. 12 tanks have been lost but the German advance has been delayed. The 16e BCP manages to take Perthes and to rescue the French 127e RI still fighting in the town (only 7 officers, 3 NCOs and 35 men still alive). Together they will defend the town until 22h00 when they received the order to pull back. Thanks to this attack the 14e DI (general De Lattre) could retreat in good conditions. ---------- On its side, the \"groupement Salani\u00e9\" (35 tanks) encounters elements of the 1.PzD (including PzRgt.2) north of Juniville. The 10 B1bis tanks from the 1/41e BCC led by capitaine Billotte (the \"butcher of Stonne\", where he destroyed 11 PzIII, 2 PzIV and 2 Pak36 in one attack) are stopped next to the Pommery farm. The company is encircled at 19h00 by tanks from the Pz.Rgt.2, by AT guns and by howitzers used in direct fire. The 1/41e BCC has to assault the German troops. 4 Renault B1bis are put out of combat : \"Silvaner\", \"Volnay\", \"Vauquois\" and \"Maury\". \u2022 B1bis \"Silvaner\" : destroyed by AA/AT guns, the driver is KIA. \u2022 B1bis \"Volnay\" : hit by numerous not penetrating shells but fuel leaking on the bottom ignites a fire in the tank. The crew is forced to evacuate, all the men are WIA, taken POWs (one man will die 6 days later) and the tank explodes. \u2022 B1bis \"Vauquois\" : hit by artillery (10.5cm) shells, damaged (1 WIA). The tank is scuttled and abandoned. \u2022 B1bis \"Maury\" : hit by numerous AT shells and artillery shells. The right track is destroyed and the tank is put on fire. The crew leaves the B1bis and is captured by German troops. Two of the men will die later in the German Lazaret. On the B1bis \"Maury\", many impacts (not penetrating shells) can be seen. The cooling intake shutter seems to have been hit many times but apparently there is no clear penetration. Launched at 17h00, the counter-attack of the 3e DCR elements is blocked and the remaining troops are ordered to retreat at 21h00 after more than 3 hours of combat. 19 B1bis have been engaged and 7 have been destroyed or scuttled/abandoned. The 7e DLM counter-attack is launched earlier, at the beginning of the afternoon, towards Alincourt and M\u00e9nil-L\u00e9pinois. M\u00e9nil-L\u00e9pinois at less than 10km from Le Ch\u00e2telet is reached but at the same moment the right flank of the 7e DLM is attacked by the 1.PzD crossing the Retourne river south of Alincourt and Juniville. The following heavy fights turns in favour of the Germans but they are also exhausted and out of supply. The French troops can regroup and reorganize on the M\u00e9nil-L\u00e9pinois \u2013 Aussonce \u2013 La Neuville line in good conditions. On 10th June night, the French counter-attack led by the \"groupement Buisson\" (south of the Retourne river by the 7e DLM and north of the Retourne river by elements of the 3e DCR) is a failure and the French IVth Army will be forced to retreat slowly while fighting. 129 French tanks have been engaged against the 1.PzD, the Domain Premium: 17.ID and the Domain Premium: 21.ID. They faced about 260 tanks of the 1.PzD. The 2.PzD did probabably not participate to the battle. 34 French tanks have been destroyed and about 15 more damaged on 10th June. The German advance has been delayed for half a day and about 100 various German vehicles have been destroyed (including several dozen tanks, halftracks, armoured cars, trucks, cars etc.). 11th JUNE 1940 : the retreat The failure of the counter-attack forces the 14e DI to retreat in order to avoid being attacked on its rears by 2 Panzerdivisionen and 3 infantry division. With an aching the soldiers from the 14e DI, undefeated on the Aisne river, have to move south with the remnants of the 2e DI. Despite its failure the counter-attack allowed the French troops to move in good conditions. On 15th June the tanks form Guderian have opened their way towards Reims, isolating definitively the eastern French armies from the rest of France. The defense during the battle of Rethel, even if having no real impact on the whole strategic outcome, proved the value of the French soldier, condemned by the deficiencies of his high-command. Beside the numerical superiority of the German troops (ability to concentrate forces) two elements played a role in the defeat on the Aisne river : \u2022 General Klopfenstein (2e DI) refused to counter-attack on the evening of 9th June despite the pressing of General De Lattre (14e DI). That allowed the German tanks to cross the river and to increase the bridgehead during following morning. \u2022 The time required to launch the \"groupement Buisson\" counter-attack, shifting from a favourable morning situation to a desperate situation during the afternoon. In fact the delay is not only due to the time required by the movements, apparently the officers in charge of the attack did not reach at time because their convoy has met German tanks. Therefore capitaine de Hautecloque (Leclerc) took the command of the \"groupement Ma\u00eetre\". Once again the tanks where not all concentrated in a single attack and the excellent B1bis tanks were blocked by 8.8cm Flak and 10.5cm leFH used as anti-tank guns. The German rapidity and the quality of a General like Guderian made the difference and led to the brilliant German victory, much more than a supposed German armaments or troops superiority.

At 11h00 about 100 German tanks are reported north of Juniville. At 12h05 the patrols report the encirclement of Perthes by 30 tanks and motocyclists. One Panhard 178 is lost during the morning by one of the numerous Ju-87 Stuka attacks, the German control the skies and use their Luftwaffe as often as possible to support their attacks. The French air force is inactive and the AA guns are rather rare. At 12h30, the 7e DLM is deployed in the area of La Neuville in order to control the line M\u00e9nil-L\u00e9pinois \u2013 Aussonce \u2013 La Neuville. The Hotchkiss H35 tanks of the 8e RD have been taken in schools and are very old and exhausted vehicles. Most of them have been immobilized by mechanical failures. All the 20 H39s but only few H35s are operational in the 8e RD which is therefore reduced (probably about 25 tanks). The 1/31e RDP infantry company is deployed north of La Neuville in a wood on the border of the road between Juniville and La Neuville. 2 infantry companies, 1 support company and armored cars are in Aussonce. 3 Hotchkiss tanks squadrons of the 8e RD (about 20 tanks) relieve Panhard 178s from the 4e RAM in M\u00e9nil L\u00e9pinois : the 3/8e RD in the town itself and the 2/8e RD and 4/8e RD next to it. French reconnaissance patrols are in contact with German tanks on the road between Juniville and La Neuville. The Panhard 178 armored cars try to delay the advancing German tanks but one vehicle is lost and the reconnaissance patrol retreats. The groupement Aussenac next to La Neuville is composed of : \u2022 10e BCC (40 Renault R35) \u2022 1/8e RD (8 Hotchkiss H35/39) \u2022 4/14e RDP (1 infantry squadron/company) reinforced by AT guns from the EDAC The 1/10e BCC (13 Renault R35 tanks) remains in La Neuville and the other elements of the groupement Aussenac begin their movement towards Juniville at 13h30 but they are blocked 2 km north by numerous German tanks and AT guns. The 2/10e BCC (13 Renault R35 tanks) engages the battle but their 37mm SA18 gun lacks power and they have to go to close range with more numerous German tanks. 9 Renault R35 are destroyed and the 4 other retreats. Of these 4 tanks only one is able to continue to fight. The German tanks continue their progression and encounter the trucks carrying the 4/14e RDP (infantry company). The French troops disembark in a hurry and take position in the woods around the road. Immediately, the 1/8e RD with only 8 tanks counter-attacks against about 30 German tanks. The squadron commander (capitaine de Loriol) with 3 other tanks manages to outflank the enemy and 2 German tanks are destroyed by the mar\u00e9chal-des-logis Flouret. Surprised, the Germans stop their attack and move back. On the French side 2 immobilized Hotchkiss tanks are scuttled. The 3/10e BCC (13 Renault R35 tanks) is then ordered to push towards Juniville to rescue the survivors of the 2/10e BCC. They are soon stopped by a German artillery barrage followed by German tanks attacking on the flank. One Renault R35 is destroyed, the others retreat in the cover of the woods hold by the French infantry. During all the afternoon, the 3/10e BCC launches successive counter-attacks to delay the 1.PzD, loosing 7 more R35s, but they manage to rescue the survivors from the 2/10e BCC and to recover several immobilized tanks. One motorcyclists platoon advances 500m more north and capture several items and documents in a German tank wreck. Under heavy fire they retreat with 3 WIAs. At about 16h00 the German tanks and mechanized troops attack the woods hold by the French infantry supported by the remaining 6 Renault R35 and 6 Hotchkiss H35/39. Two German tanks are destroyed and once more they are pulled back. On the French side 2 men have been killed and several WIA. Two German AT guns take position next to the woods and open fire on a R35 tank. 2 shells miss the tank and both AT guns are destroyed. The Germans cancel their attack and the job is given to the German artillery which bombards the woods occupied by the French troops. During the evening, most of the French tanks move back to La Neuville. At 21h00, the French infantry is close to be out of ammunition but is still controlling the road, supported by 3 Renault R35 tanks and 2 25mm AT guns. The French infantry in the woods is being slowly encircled and at 23h30 they are ordered to retreat to La Neuville, on the main French line. At 18h00 German tanks are also spotted in the woods north of Aussonce, between M\u00e9nil L\u00e9pinois and Juniville. Lieutenant De Vill\u00e8le from 2/8e RD moves with 4 Hotchkiss tanks to meet them. They first encounter ambushed German AT guns and later tanks. 2 Hotchkiss tanks are destroyed and lieutenant De Vill\u00e8le is KIA with his driver. From the 27 Renault R35 tanks engaged by the 2/10e BCC and 2/10e BCC (two companies of 13 tanks and the battalion commander's tank) : \u2022 10 have been destroyed \u2022 10 are damaged but recovered and under repair \u2022 7 are operational The 1/10e BCC has 13 more tanks and there are also the 5 replacement tanks of the battalion for a total of 20-25 operational tanks. The remnants of the 1/8e RD (1 fully operational tank and 5 tanks under repair) deploy at La Neuville at 01h00. At the end of 10th June, 4 Hotchkiss tanks have been destroyed, 5 are under repair and about 16 are still operational. That makes a total of 36-41 operational tanks and several armoured cars to stop the German Panzerdivisionen moving south. But the Germans have to delay the advance, out of fuel and ammunition they return to their lines on the Retourne river and will proceed with their offensive on 11th June. The town of La Neuville will be bombarded all night long by the German artillery, 1 AMR is destroyed by the indirect hit of a 150mm shell. At 22h30 the 7e DLM is reinforced by a company of the 152e RI, the \"Red Devils\" of the 14e DI. On 11th June 1940 the French forces move about 10-15km south / south-west while fighting all the day long. During all the day the French troops will be attacked by the Luftwaffe. During following days the battle strength of the 7e DLM will quickly fall to about 50%. On 11th June morning the reinforcement company of the 152e RI stops German infantry between Aussonce and La Neuville. The French strongpoints south of La Neuville (3/31e RDP and 4/31e RDP), next to the Le Merlan farm, immobilize a few German tanks thanks to their AT guns. The German artillery enters in action, destroying several French trucks and side-cars. The 8 remaining Panhard 178s from capitaine Gobert delay the German advance south of La Neuville while the French infantry retreats. Ambushed in the woods they surprise 30 German tanks : 2 are immobilized and 3 are knocked out. The swift French armored cars \"hit and run\" without being hit until they are ordered to retreat too. In Selles and Heutr\u00e9giville, the few tanks from the 4/8e RD delay the German advancing tanks. In Pontfaverger 2 Hotchkiss from the 1/8e RD resist against 50 German tanks until their complete destruction. In B\u00e9thenville, engineers supported by dragoons (infantry) mine the bridges (2 bridges and 1 rail-road bridge) and blow them at 12.30 AM. They entrench behind the Suippe river and face the German attacks. But the Germans have crossed the river in Pontfaverger and enters in B\u00e9thenville from the south-west. Thanks to an alcohol distillery put on fire while the German tanks were in the corresponding street, a real firewall is created, blocking the German progression. The remaining tanks of the 8e RD prevent the encirclement while the infantry exits from B\u00e9thenville and retreats. The last Hotchkiss tanks of the 8e RD are destroyed, sacrificed against impossible odds to save their comrades. The 7e DLM will fight continuously until 24th June 1940, sacrificing its units, men, vehicles to cover other troops, inflicting heavy losses to the enemy.

I found several more information partly in the book \"Fallait-il sauver le char Bayard\" by Ren\u00e9 Boly. -------------- On 10th May morning, the \"groupement Buisson\" is the single unit able to lead a counter-attack in the area of Rethel. But it was south of the Retourne river and had first to cross it. The tanks reached their base line only at 14h00. At this moment the German bridgehead's size has already considerably increased. After refuelling, the unit is ready to attack at 15h00 but is only launched at 17h00. The French counter-attack is launched without artillery or aviation support. The movements of the \"groupement Buisson\" are spotted by the Luftwaffe and will be stopped mainly by the numerous guns installed in anti-tank role by the Domain Premium: 21.ID. The \"groupement Buisson\" is split in 2 parts : 1) One part which has crossed the Retourne river more on the east and will attack the Germans from an east / south-east axis : \u2022 Northern attack on the Annelles - Perthes axis (groupement of lieutenant-colonel Ma\u00eetre) with elements of the 3e DCR : 17 Hotchkiss H39 (2/42e and 3/42e BCC), 9 Renault B1bis (2/41e BCC) and the 3 infantry companies of the 16e BCP (bataillon de chasseurs port\u00e9s). \u2022 Southern attack on the Juniville - Tagnon axis (groupement of lieutenant-colonel Salani\u00e9) with elements of the 3e DCR : 25 Hotchkiss H39 (45e BCC), 10 Renault B1bis (1/41e BCC), and of the 7e DLM : reduced 31e RDP (r\u00e9giment de dragons port\u00e9s). \u2022 A few B1bis tanks from the 3/41e BCC remain in Annelles as protection and take not part to the attack. 2) One part south of the Retourne river, composed of the 10e BCC (40 Renault R35) and of the 7e DLM (division l\u00e9g\u00e8re m\u00e9canique) from general Marteau which will counter-attack on the M\u00e9nil-L\u00e9pinois - Alincourt - Le Ch\u00e2telet axis. The \"groupement Ma\u00eetre\" (26 tanks) includes these 9 B1bis tanks : \u2022 B1bis \"Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape\" (capitaine Gasc) \u2022 B1bis \"Aisne\" (lieutenant Hom\u00e9) \u2022 B1bis \"Yonne\" (aspirant Laval) \u2022 B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\" (sous-lieutenant Tuffet) \u2022 B1bis \"Durance\" (lieutenant Carraz) \u2022 B1bis \"Arlay\" (aspirant Thor\u00e9) \u2022 B1bis \"Bayard\" (sous-lieutenant Soulet) \u2022 B1bis \"Villers-Marmery\" (adjudant-chef Mar\u00e9chal) \u2022 B1bis \"Pinard\" (aspirant Bergeal) The French tanks crushes some German troops, reaches Perthes and inflicts heavy losses to the German troops of the IR.3 and IR.5 (Domain Premium: 21.ID). A German artillery barrage added to the direct fire of the 8.8cm Flak and 10.5cm leFH18 guns from the Domain Premium: 21.ID, reinforced by the Panzerj\u00e4ger-Abteilung 560 (8.8cm Flak), blocks the French advance, destroying 9 Hotchkiss H39 and 3 Renault B1bis tanks. The action is here described by sous-lieutenant Tuffet, commander of the B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\". The Hotchkiss H39 are progressing in front of the B1bis tanks. After having crossed a hill the H39s are engaged by very numerous AT guns and HMGs deployed behind and along a road. The 9 B1bis of the 2/41e BCC charge then against the German positions to cover the Hotchkiss tanks.With their 47mm turret guns and the 75mm hull gun the French B1bis tanks fire towards the flashes revealing the German AT guns' positions. With its coaxial MG lieutenant Tuffet kills a whole squad of German soldiers moving along the road. A bit later he destroyed 2 self-propelled guns (no information about the exact type).Many Pak36 anti-tank guns are firing on the B1bis \"Aisne\" which is hit many times but without effect and it fires intensively back. The B1bis \"Aisne\" reached the road, crushes some German soldiers and a Pak36 under its tracks and destroys a MG nest.The B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\" is hit by many 3.7cm shells, no penetration at all but the bad feeling of being a target. About every 5 seconds a 3.7cm shell is clicking against the armor. The periscope of the copula is destroyed. One bolt goes away and hits the helmet of the radio but without any injury. The B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\" fires with all its weapons while advancing in the German lines.Added to the German AT gun firing, the German artillery barrage is always more intense. Lieutenant Tuffet sees the \"Aisne\" and \"Yonne\" tanks firing on the enemy's position. On the left he spots an AT gun firing on the \"Aisne\" and he destroys it with is 47mm turret gun. A running German soldier is also killed with the coaxial MG. Suddenly a violent shock, the 47mm gun sight is destroyed and the turret is blocked. Through the episcopes lieutenant Tuffet sees the B1bis \"Yonne\" being abandoned and scuttled by its crew. The B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\" fires then only with the 75mm hull gun but a second very violent explosion neutralizes the 75mm SA35 gun too. The radio antenna is also destroyec. Unarmed, the B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\" moves back and recovers the crew of the \"Yonne\" which embarks thanks to the bottom hatch. Some equipments stored on the tank roof (blankets) are put on fire. The tank pulls back in cover and lieutenant Tuffet stops the fire with an extinguisher. It is about 20h30 and the B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\", damaged, moves back to the departure line in Annelles. Perthes is on fire and the German artillery barrage is still very intense.The B1bis \"Aisne\" is still advancing in the German lines and destroys a German infantry squad hidden in a field. A violent shock on the hull, a second one on the copula which destroys the binoculars. Lieutenant Hom\u00e9 is WIA and blind during several minutes. One fuel tank is also damaged and fuel is leaking on the floor. The \"Aisne\" pulls back in the French lines. It is more than 21h00, after more than 3 hours of combat.The B1bis \"Bayard\" has its turret MG damaged by a 3.7cm shell at the very beginning of the engagement. A 10.5cm shell penetrates the right side hull and 1 crew member is lightly wounded but the tank is still operational and destroys many AT guns before retreating to the French lines.From the 9 B1bis, 3 have been destroyed or abandoned (\"Yonne\", \"Durance\" and \"Arlay\"), 4 are damaged (\"Aisne\", \"Corbi\u00e8res\", \"Villers-Marmery\" and \"Bayard\") but returned in the French lines and 2 are still fully operational.All the surviving tanks are covered by numerous 3.7cm shells impacts that did not penetrate the armor. On the B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\" more than 100 3.7cm shells gouges could be counted. Destroyed/abandoned B1bis : \u2022 B1bis \"Yonne\" : under fire from 10 various AA/AT guns firing from the front and the left. The tanks destroys 5 of them but one German shell ignites a fire in the engine. It is extinguished but the tank is immobilized, the 75mm SA35 hull gun is therefore grossly useless. The tank continues to fire with the 47mm turret gun and the coaxial MG but one shell finally blocks the turret. The tank is scuttled and the tank explodes. The crew is safe and retreats in the French lines in the B1bis \"Corbi\u00e8res\". \u2022 B1bis \"Durance\" : destroyed by 10.5cm shells, the 75mm gun loader is KIA. \u2022 B1bis \"Arlay\" : destroyed by several 10.5cm shells, all the crew members are KIA The attack of the \"groupement Ma\u00eetre\" is led by the capitaine De Hautecloque (as known as \"Leclerc\", future commander of the famous 2e DB, the 2nd French armoured division), he walks in front of the infantry and the tanks with his famous stick. 12 tanks have been lost but the German advance has been delayed. The 16e BCP manages to take Perthes and to rescue the French 127e RI still fighting in the town (only 7 officers, 3 NCOs and 35 men still alive). Together they will defend the town until 22h00 when they received the order to pull back. Thanks to this attack the 14e DI (general De Lattre) could retreat in good conditions. ---------- On its side, the \"groupement Salani\u00e9\" (35 tanks) encounters elements of the 1.PzD (including PzRgt.2) north of Juniville. The 10 B1bis tanks from the 1/41e BCC led by capitaine Billotte (the \"butcher of Stonne\", where he destroyed 11 PzIII, 2 PzIV and 2 Pak36 in one attack) are stopped next to the Pommery farm. The company is encircled at 19h00 by tanks from the Pz.Rgt.2, by AT guns and by howitzers used in direct fire. The 1/41e BCC has to assault the German troops. 4 Renault B1bis are put out of combat : \"Silvaner\", \"Volnay\", \"Vauquois\" and \"Maury\". \u2022 B1bis \"Silvaner\" : destroyed by AA/AT guns, the driver is KIA. \u2022 B1bis \"Volnay\" : hit by numerous not penetrating shells but fuel leaking on the bottom ignites a fire in the tank. The crew is forced to evacuate, all the men are WIA, taken POWs (one man will die 6 days later) and the tank explodes. \u2022 B1bis \"Vauquois\" : hit by artillery (10.5cm) shells, damaged (1 WIA). The tank is scuttled and abandoned. \u2022 B1bis \"Maury\" : hit by numerous AT shells and artillery shells. The right track is destroyed and the tank is put on fire. The crew leaves the B1bis and is captured by German troops. Two of the men will die later in the German Lazaret. On the B1bis \"Maury\", many impacts (not penetrating shells) can be seen. The cooling intake shutter seems to have been hit many times but apparently there is no clear penetration. Launched at 17h00, the counter-attack of the 3e DCR elements is blocked and the remaining troops are ordered to retreat at 21h00 after more than 3 hours of combat. 19 B1bis have been engaged and 7 have been destroyed or scuttled/abandoned. ---------- A photo in the book, from Robert Marcy's collection.
