            "answer_text": "One major impact of The Industrial Revolution was the vast improvement in instrument construction, and with new technical resources at their disposal, composers were able to write more complex music for instruments, and so it could be said that these technical resources had a major stylistic impetus. I have written elsewhere about certain improvements, and will therefore summarise some of them here:The extension of the piano's range, the addition of an iron frame and \"over-stringing\" made possible a much bigger, almost SYMPHONIC  sound on the piano, and Liszt was one of the first to exploit these new possibilities.  He regularly played his own piano arrangements of Beethoven symphonies, and some claimed that they made an even more striking effect (I would venture to disagree on that though! It was probably more due to Liszt's charisma). The introduction of the double escapement action also made possible some of those Liszt hallmarks of rapid repeated notes, which feature in much music of virtuosic display. Mass construction of instruments became possible, and so they became cheaper, extending the possibility of music-making to the masses rather than an intellectual preserve of a few. Other technological innovations included the addition of valves to the brass,  which enabled composers to create more interesting parts for them (particularly trumpets, because hand horns far more versatility through hand-stopping).  When you get to the Late Romantics like Tchaikovsky, he treats the three major orchestral departments (ww, brass, strings)  with an equality that was well nigh impossible for pre-industrial revolution composers, where a major function of the brass was to come in at climaxes.  One qualification, however, should be noted: the clarino register writing for trumpets in Bach's era, which during the classical age declined). Prior to the Industrial Revolution, woodwind instruments lacked the complex key and rod mechanism that made possible the reaching of awkward bore holes, and so there were previously problems of intonation that had to be circumvented by awkward fingerings.  It must be remembered, that holes on a wind instrument have to be bored at acoustically correct places, and these places can be almost unreachable without the key and rod mechanism that became available. Some important names connected with these advances are: Sebastian Erard: patented improvements to piano and harp;Heinrich Stolzel: said to be the inventor of valves; Theobold Boehm: the ww key mechanism.

            "answer_text": "The Romanticism movement itself was a reaction against the Industrial Revolution. It involved pretty much any artistic medium, including literature and art.As society was becoming more advanced and science progressed, people felt that they were becoming more and more distanced from nature (which they were.) Many people looked back to nature and tried to capture the mystery of it and the awe that it inspired. It often had themes of heroism or stories of an epic nature. Ghosts and spirits were also another recurring theme. It focused on the sublime, things of such grandeur and scale that your emotions were ignited and inspired.Beethoven is said to have started this movement in music, or at least bridged the gap between the Classical Music era and the Romantic period. His third symphony is an example of the theme of heroism.   In pretty much all respects, music became bigger and grander. Orchestras were expanded and new instruments were added. Musical pieces themselves became longer and more emotionally charged. In my opinion, they had much more of a narrative quality. They really took you on a journey.From a more theoretical perspective, the music involved a lot more chromaticism, as other more foreign keys were explored. Motivic development was used to greater degree and was used as a glue to hold together a vast array of different ideas and musical material.The period was said to have ended with the opera composer, Richard Wagner. Really, he was a late-Romantic composer. He used chromaticism to such a high degree, that tonality was barely present. He operas were incredibly long, usually over 3 hours each. They are incredibly rich and emotionally compelling. Film music today is really derived from his legacy. He too used themes of heroism and derived a lot of inspiration from Norse Mythology. His music is incredibly beautiful and some of my favorites.   Really, Romanticism is a huge topic and I encourage you to investigate it further. It was truly the high point for the more traditional aesthetics in the arts. Once the modern period came in, all the walls were broken and anything went. It was a direct result of the industrial revolution and the changed to society that it brought. As people became more and more removed from nature, they looked to the things that still eluded science and technology for inspiration. They looked to the things that still couldn't be explained, that couldn't be mastered by machines. The work from this era in music (and the arts in general) is some of the most emotionally moving and powerful that has ever been created by humans. Cheers. ",
