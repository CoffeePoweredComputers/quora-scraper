            "answer_text": "Wisdom is a virtue that isn\u2019t innate, but can only be acquired through experience. Anyone who is interested in trying new things and reflecting on the process has the ability to gain wisdom. By learning as much as you can, analyzing your experiences and putting your knowledge to the test, you can become a wiser person. Part One of Three: Gaining Experience Edit 1 Try new things. It's hard to gain wisdom when you stay in and do the same thing day after day. You get wiser when you put yourself out there and give yourself the opportunity to learn, make mistakes and reflect on the experience. If you tend to be on the inhibited side, work on cultivating an inquisitive spirit and the willingness to put yourself in new situations.[1] Every time you experience something new, you open yourself up to the possibility of learning and getting a little wiser for having tried it. Going to places you've never been before is a great way to get some life experience. Such as booking a trip to another city, or taking a road trip to the next town over. Make an effort to eat at a restaurant that's popular with the locals, rather than going to your favorite chain. Every chance you get, choose newness over the familiar. Trying new social activities is another good way to open up your world. If you tend to spend your time watching sports, get tickets to see a play. If you're a total bookworm, you could sign up for a hiking club or join a bowling team. 2 Step out of your comfort zone. If you\u2019re afraid to do something, perhaps that\u2019s the very thing you should try to do. When you have to deal with an awkward or scary situation, you come out on the other side better equipped to handle fear the next time you face it. As Eleanor Roosevelt said, \u201cWe gain strength, and courage, and confidence by each experience in which we really stop to look fear in the face . . . we must do that which we think we cannot.\u201d For example, if you\u2019re afraid of public speaking, volunteer to give a presentation. If you dislike talking about your feelings, make an effort to have a conversation with a loved one telling the person how much you care. Ask the person how he or she feels, too. 3 Make an effort to talk to people you don\u2019t know very well. Talk to people from different backgrounds and with different perspectives from yours, and pay attention to what you can learn from them. Try not to judge them based on your own narrow point of view. The more you're able to empathize with others, the wiser you will be.[2] Practice being a good listener, and ask a lot of questions to find out more. Really pay attention to what people are saying instead of letting your mind wander. Every conversation gives you the chance to understand someone better, broaden your views and thus become wiser. Share yourself with the people you're talking to, too. Work on going deeper than casual conversation and fostering new friendships. 4 Be open-minded. Instead of judging things you don\u2019t know much about, consider them from every angle and make an effort to understand.[3] It's easy to base our views on the limited experiences we've had in life, but that's not the way to gain wisdom. You can't help that you've grown up in a certain place with certain people, but you can decide how open you are to learning about different ways of life. Don\u2019t base your opinions of things on what other people think, or whether something is popular. Do your own research and look at both sides of the story before you decide what you think about something. For example, maybe you think a certain type of music isn\u2019t cool because none of your friends like it. Before you jump on the bandwagon, try seeing a band play the music live, and read up on its history. When you've taken time to understand something, you can decide you don't like it, but not before then.

            "answer_text": " A famous philosopher has been teaching his students about politics and ethics for years. His students dislike him, since he constantly belittles their intellect and brags about his. One day, a young girl musters up the courage in class to ask him a simple question: \u201cHow does one gain wisdom?\u201d This catches the philosopher off-guard. He doesn\u2019t know what to say and tries to explain that he doesn\u2019t know the answer to her question, since he focuses on ethics and political philosophy, and not epistemology. The girl is surprised, \u201cYou brag about how smart you are and how dumb we are, but you can\u2019t answer the simple question of how one gains wisdom?!!\u201d The class bursts into laughter.  The next day, the philosopher confronts the girl, \u201cThe only reason I couldn\u2019t answer your question yesterday was because I didn\u2019t have time to think about it, otherwise the answer is simple: You gain wisdom from introspection. In fact, this is the only way to gain wisdom.\u201d The girl smirks, \u201cAre you sure? If we can only gain wisdom by thinking on our own, then why are we taking classes from you?\u201d The philosopher is speechless and the class starts to laugh at him again.  A humbled philosopher comes to class the next day and addresses the girl, \u201cI apologize for having been so arrogant over the years. I hope you can forgive me. You have taught me an important lesson: You can gain wisdom from others. \u201d The girl is pleased but decides to gloat, \u201cYou are a fool. I know far more than you ever did and should be teaching this class, since there is nothing more you can teach me.\u201d The philosopher sees his opening, \u201cReally? I was about to teach a third way to gain wisdom that neither of us has mentioned. But I guess you can tell us.\u201d The girl regrets her boast, \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201d Her classmates snicker. After an embarrassingly long pause she asks, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cYou can gain wisdom from experience. The experience of being embarrassed in front of this class for boastfulness has taught me humility. I hope it teaches the same to you too.\u201d  Confucius has said \u201cBy three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.\u201d There are other ways to gain wisdom too, but I think these three are a good start.

            "answer_text": " Wisdom is not gained, but uncovered! Our wisdom is a certain process of our mind! Dig deep within: Wisdom is secretly hidden in our minds just like a wealth of pot is hidden in our backyard. This pot of wealth was hidden by our grandfather in the backyard just to test whether we will take the pains to dig it our or not. We need not do anything to create it as it is already there. All we have to do is to dig ourselves deep within! Improving wisdom is what we do less with the senses and more with the sensibility! Being critical of the world is an obstacle to wisdom: If we gain false buoyancy by criticizing others, we can be sure of distancing ourselves from wisdom. Blaming others for our problems engages us in a vicious circle which traps us into a cauldron of anxiety and stress. They are self-sabotaged and there is no time in them for wisdom. Therefore, the first enemy of wisdom is criticising others. If criticising others were to create a sense of \u2018feel-good\u2019 factor within you, take it for granted that you are not a person of wisdom. The next enemy of wisdom is: Worrying about the future: Did you know I said this in my TEDx talk, \u201cyesterday is but a rejected cheque, tomorrow is a promissory note and today is cash\u201d There is a lot of difference between \u2018being terrified of the future\u2019 and \u2018taking reasonable steps to reduce the uncertainty of the future\u2019. The fear of the future is the worst nightmare of a person who thinks that he can rectify the future by just thinking. Thinking is a subtle phenomenon and the physical world is a solid operational world. We can never bring them together. However, we can equate them when we go beyond the physicality of sensory perception. This is the where wisdom dawns! Wisdom never lies in routine! Many people think that by cheating others they can make a profit and that is wisdom. They are thoroughly mistaken. Wisdom is that state where it should give us peace and tranquillity amidst adversity! A man who has made money by cheating or evading tax will not have peace of mind when tax authorities raid him. He will lose all his peace of mind if his whole family succumbs to Coronavirus. Whatever you are doing now using this physical body for this physical body and its security and enjoyment by employing illegal, immoral, unsocial, and dishonest means is not wisdom at all. Why is this not wisdom? Wisdom always gives permanent results and not impermanent. Whatever wealth they earned by illegal means just evaporated because of submicroscopic protein molecule which has no connection with their wealth, how can we take such wealth as permanent? When it is not permanent, how can that be an act of wisdom? I am a man of wisdom! I think I am a man of wisdom. I left a lucrative position which would have given me millions of dollars and joined an organization where I can educate people. Whatever little I have is sufficient for my life and I never beg from others. I continue to be happy. How about a person who lost billions in these days? Can they be happy? Therefore, wisdom is something that is not connected with our routine living but which deals with something beyond the routine. Future is uncertain: The future created by the material world of money is an illusion of uncertainty. People of wisdom understand that life is inherently uncertain. They face up to this uncertain world with a certain clarity that the \u2018world in which we live including this physical body is uncertain\u2019. They accept the path of acceptance rather than denial. I am promoting the principle of \u2018ACT\u2019 during this Covid19 time. A- Acceptance C- Commitment T- Therapy People of wisdom accept that the world is uncertain and later they take up only those undertakings which stabilize their accepted principle and this is their commitment. This serves as a therapy for the ailment of stress, and anxiety. They know that worry drains our today's strength and make us incapable of facing tomorrows adversity. The past is a rejected cheque! People of wisdom understand this. They never ruminate on past mistakes. They take past mistakes as experiences which have taught them lessons. They forget the past as easily as we have forgotten our childhood, diseased mother/father/spouse. We can forget these things easily but we cannot forget the harm done by an enemy. People of wisdom move on and they don\u2019t allow the past to hurt their future journey. One thing is sure, the past can never be corrected or recalled. It is done. People of wisdom focus on the time which is becoming so fast, the past! There is no way of holding the water of a flowing river. You should flow with it. Human being has a weakness of sticking to the routine! This is the greatest built-in weakness of the human being. Whatever it is, he/she gets inured to it and wants the same thing to continue. He is the lover of routine. He wants to get up at the right time, have breakfast at the same time, everything should go as he wants it to happen. If everything were to go smoothly without any change, a human being would not have even died because no one wants to die. A man of wisdom knows that the world is a play and there should be surprises, otherwise, the whole show becomes a flop. Do you watch a movie which does not have a twist and turn? Ordinary people think too much while men of wisdom think little! Those who daydream are fools and those who enjoy the present moment are people of wisdom. Most of us daydream. All most all of us have unrealistic expectations. We suddenly want to become a billionaire or a movie icon. If you are not a person with good looks and have no acting talent, you cannot have an illusion of becoming a hero. It soon becomes a disillusion. A man of wisdom enjoys what he knows best. If he is a musician, he wants to learn more and more rather than making money out of that. The money may come as a byproduct. Men of wisdom never lose hope but have no expectations. Whatever that comes their way, they enjoy. They know that it is of no use to wear goggles when they are blind; no use of shoes when they are lame; no use of earphones when they are deaf; they know that if they leave this moment unenjoyed with all the organs of the body working, they will be committing an astronomical blunder!

            "answer_text": "A wise old woman who was traveling in the mountains found a precious stone in a stream. The next day she met another traveler who was hungry, and the wise woman opened her bag to share her food. The hungry traveler saw the precious stone in her bag and wondered what an old woman would do with a precious stone. So, he asked the woman to give it to him. To his amazement, the wise woman said, \u201ctake it, I don\u2019t need it\u201d, and gave him the stone without hesitation. The traveler left, excited and rejoicing for his good fortune, which he had obtained without any struggle. He knew the stone was worth a fortune to give him enough security for the rest of his life. He realized he would never have to struggle for food, money or shelter, ever again. However, only a few days later, he came back to return the stone to the surprise of the wise old woman. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d he said, \u201cI know how valuable the stone is, but I want to give it back in the hope that you can give me something even more precious. Give me what you have within you that enabled you to give me something as precious as this stone.\u201d \u201cWhat you did was wise\u201d, said the wise old woman. \u201cYou used your brain correctly and quickly realized that this stone is worthless unless your brain is valuable.\u201d So, the wise old woman sat down the man and began to teach him everything she knew about wisdom: To acquire wisdom, you MUST commit yourself to a process of learning and applying what you\u2019ve learned. The process takes a long, protracted time of discomfort, pain and struggle.Examine yourself first. You may already posses many traits or qualities of wisdom within you. Don\u2019t just dismiss everything you have or everything life has taught you, including the struggles life has put you through. 20% of it is valuable, but 80% of it is junk.You must be wiling to go through the school of life and be willing to practice patience, persistence and endurance. I can\u2019t promise you it\u2019s going to be easy, but with the right mindset, coupled with the desire to acquire something more precious than gold, or precious stones, you can get there.There\u2019s no set timeline or duration for learning wisdom, and there\u2019s no measurement of wisdom. IT is a continuous process that involves lifelong learning. Wisdom gained fast will soon be forgotten and die. People who gain wisdom fast will die without it.First, you must kill all forms of fear, and develop a thick skin for failure, ridicule, risk, people\u2019s jealousy, slander, bullying, persecution, and everything related with pride. Instead embrace humility.People will hurt you, and you will feel much pain. But this is nothing compared to how you will destroy yourself if you don\u2019t learn to forgive, and control anger and bitterness.Most people have no time for wisdom and will do anything to avoid it. In fact, many people would rather die without it, because most people love life\u2019s shortcuts.Wisdom is acquired through years of struggle, mistakes, and errors. Schools teach you to avoid mistakes. Life teaches you to make mistakes so that you can increase wisdom by discovering why you made mistakes and errors. The more you learn, the less the struggles, therefore, the less the mistakes.I\u2019m not teaching you to go out there and look for mistakes and failure. I\u2019m teaching you to prepare for them because life is full of them. However, I\u2019m teaching you to learn from them if they occur.Every so often, find a quiet place. Alone. No mobile phones, no internet, no computers, and no television. Away from all the noise. Away from the office, away from the crowds and away from everything. Just quite, clean air and nature. Take this opportunity to empty yourself of all knowledge and life\u2019s frustrations. At least for the moment. How do you feel? Now, take a deep breath and savour the fresh clean air. Ask yourself\u2014\u201dwhat I\u2019m I doing wrong or right?\u201d Start questioning everything. Then start from a clean slate\u2014A clean canvas. Detoxify your brain of all garbage.Wisdom is not knowledge. In fact, wisdom is contrary to knowledge, for you don\u2019t require an education to acquire it, but you require an open mind, determination and common sense to gain it.Grab a book of wisdom and read it as if your life depended on it. For example, you can start by reading the book of Proverbs in the bible, written by the wisest man who ever lived. Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not religious. Although it\u2019s found in the bible, it\u2019s not a religious book. Kings have read it. Non-religious people have read it, and acquired more wisdom to protect their kingdoms, their wealth, their lives, and their families.You will not become wise overnight or by reading wisdom books alone. But you will become wise through persistence and experience, and by practicing what wisdom books say.Learn to be polite and kind. Learn to share, and learn to help. You don\u2019t acquire wisdom by grabbing and accumulating everything to yourself. You gain wisdom by sharing the little you have with others who don\u2019t have anything.Learn the art of listening and acknowledge that you don\u2019t know everything. In fact, the listener gains more than the speaker, and the speaker loses more than the listener. Socrates said it all when he said, \u201cThis much I know-I know nothing\u2026\u201dAlthough wisdom is invisible, the impact of wisdom is visible. Although wisdom is sometimes acquired through trial and error, once acquired, the trials and errors will decrease significantly as you become wiser.Wisdom is more important than gold, diamonds or any precious stones. It gives you the power to acquire anything you want, but more importantly, it gives you the power to control greed and avoid danger.

            "answer_text": "Wisdom is not a direct goal and cannot be systematically captured. Wisdom is the natural product of purposed meditation, study and experience that leads toward honest self-knowledge. It is only the self which can be most directly understood. It is only the self that can be intentionally and purposefully altered by the self. The more perfectly that one understands and controls their own self, the more evident the universal patterns and scenarios become. A summary of wisdom: This is a recent interpretation of the opening to Ecclesiastics chapter 2 When meditating very deeply about it, years of religious study and the practicing of deep piety, led me to understand how unreasonable most of religion is. It was painful to meditate upon, but I had to admit to myself that religion and piety had failed to bring peace to my mind at any level. This act of internal honesty was the first spark of Spiritual Wisdom. When meditating very deeply about it, I realized that for all of my religious study and practice, that I understood no more than when I began. I learned with certainty that doctrine could not bring wholeness to the mind, and this understanding was the beginning of Intellectual Wisdom. After so much indoctrination, I had religiously concluded that the absurdity that resulted in laughter added nothing to understanding, and I piously believed that pleasure could not increase wisdom, so it is not useful. I discovered that I had been taught spiritual foolishness from the beginning. I had learned to live in shadows and confusion. After so much confusion, I decided that I would fully participate in everything that people do for enjoyment and pleasure. I desired to know what in the entire world could guide mankind into peace and emotional health. I tried to be happy, by eating and drinking, making sport of everything, as I felt inclined. This was when I learned of my innate natural material foolishness. With this new effort, I made no progress at all in finding emotional health. This led me to understand that this endeavor was also a useless waste of time. After so much wasted time, I now see that I have lived all of these things so that I could apply my best reasoning in order to discover the most beneficial path into the wholeness of the mind. I had been practicing intellectual foolishness from the start. I had considered only those things that my eyes could see and my ears could hear. I had only put my hand upon those things, which my hand could take hold of. My strength was spent upon faulty efforts. After so much faulty effort, I utterly despaired to realize that nothing that I could find upon the earth, could satisfy the psyche, and bring peace to the hearts of mankind. I was perfecting emotional foolishness when I became deeply depressed to think that nothing could bring wholeness to the minds of humanity. As a result of these experiences all together, I found that perversity was no better or worse, than is feigned piety. When meditating very deeply about it piety, moralism, religion and laws had not brought me inner peace or true understanding. As it is not possible for God to be unreasonable or careless, the source of those unreasonable things all around me was likely a matter of perception. This realization was the beginning of Emotional Wisdom. When meditating very deeply about it, unrestricted intoxication, wealth, power, sex and fame were empty. Living only for my animal desires in the moment had not brought me inner peace and true contentment. I learned that no amount of material success could ever buy the deepest desire of the human heart, nor satisfy the mind. This understanding was the beginning of Material Wisdom. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, that question is what the Greeks searched for endlessly, and never found. Philosophy was what they ended up with to replace wisdom with. It is not an even close substitute. Let me explain a bit about myself so you can see where I am coming from. I am a Jew so obviously don't do bible. I am also a Mishnah Jew - (oral concept taught only) - Jew; but saying that doesn't mean I don't understand the foolishness of those who do. Mishnah Jews are like the Example of Moses . . . no books, no religious teachers, no scrolls, no temples or church building to attend/but rather Objective Understanding of the desire of Ruach HaKodesh Himself ,you know; the (\u201cBurning Bush\u201d style) instead. Period In Solomon\u2019s Temple there were two fires always present to see and / and ponder chimera over. The first was/is called the \u2018consuming fire\u2019/the much larger of the two. The second fire was/is called the \u2018inner fire\u2019, much smaller, but a much, much,much more powerful one.Hamashiach Himself, displayed/showed that very thing, with evidence, in A.D. 33 in Yerusalem, early in the morning, on/at the festival of first fruits: before the/an entire city; filled with visitors from all over the surrounding cities watching it for hours. Now to the question. Wisdom can not be found in the brain and it\u2019s computer style \u2018dry\u2019 answer and/ that which it always has to call in from it\u2019s emotions department, to make the \u2018dry\u2019 answer palatable. Those emotions work like a \u2018fireworks\u2019 show. They can be most exciting to watch the display itself, hear the giant BOOMs, and are really damn easy to get excited about sometimes, and/or often. The issue is that the \u2018fireworks\u2019 of emotions always leave within, and behind it a damn cloud of \u2018smoke\u2019. It will always prevent (by that smokescreen it very self) the ability to see Wisdom. Wisdom is not a \u2018thing\u2019, but rather a bonafide holy being. We bona fide Jews know him as Ruach HaKodesh. The one of whom it is said \u2018in the beginning was the Word, The Word was with G-d and was G-d, and of \u2018all\u2019 things created, nothing was created without Him. (please don\u2019t confuse that with Judaism) Hamashiach Himself gave the only answer that/which actually works when He spoke \u2018Repent, Receive the Holy Ghost\u2019. It seems like a simple answer, but Mystery Babylon is the example of failure to that very thing. That will be exactly why her last day will rise up in smoke. Religion has turned that into a damn joke! . . . They will never find Wisdom. Wisdom is also known as the \u2018new covenant\u2019 (holy understanding) Yahshua was the \u2018delivery boy\u2019 Himself of. The religion of Judaism, not unlike Mystery Babylon . . . bent it over, and drove it around the block until they killed Her. All religion works off of \u2018brain smarts\u2019, and, \u2018smarter than smarts\u2019, The snake oil salesman in Eden sold those very two things for his living. He used his \u2018educational Docotrate\u2019 along with his never matched \u2018finishing school\u2019 well learned language of Schmooze; Mystery Babylon does the very exact same thing, always has and will till she goes up in smoke. (very soon to come) In Solomon\u2019s (the wisest mortal know before Hamashiach) Temple there were \u2018twin fires\u2019. The larger one \u2018the consuming fire\u2019; the smaller one \u2018the inner fire\u2019. The consuming fire was big, and powerful enough to destroy. The smaller fire was much smaller, \u2018the inner fire\u2019 . . . but was/is much, much, much more powerful that the consuming fire, but grows \u2018life itself\u2019, and is not destructive in it\u2019s manner. Wisdom is the smaller fire given to ponder the chimera of Wisdom, it\u2019s her bona fide value and usage of her. Misusing / misrepresenting / and or \u2018shortchanging the \u2018inner fire\u2019 IS \u201cBlasphemy of the Holy Ghost. Cheapen it and you also will go up in smoke. That being well said . . . Wisdom is found by \u2018repenting\u2019 - cleaning forever out of your heart and gut - the \u2018dross\u2019 (pure, plain old poop of both religion, and society\u2019s methods of getting those \u2018brain smarts, and smarter than smarts\u2019). You gotta dump forever the \u2018book crap\u2019, the educational \u2018degree chasing crap\u2019, and the finishing school schmooze, manipulation crap. That is exactly what \u2018Repent\u2019 means. ( and that means permanently) That puts you in good shape to ask our Creator, Our Father in heaven for the gift of holy \u2018Wisdom. Ask Him and He will give you Wisdom. If you are trying to golden bullshit Him, He can smell that crap instantly, and you\u2019ll never receive her. Wisdom works from her Throne,(her Chair, well guarded by her) . . . If you are schmoozing in any leftover \u2018stink\u2019; the door to her will remain closed. Her Throne is the smack dab center of a \u2018pure heart\u2019, and cleaned out \u2018gut\u2019. She never, or ever works from the \u2018brain\u2019 or it\u2019s fireworks display of \u2018emotions\u2019. Period. That is my holy \u2018gut level\u2019 answer (: You can take that check to the bank and cash it! The check is good. That is the Wisdom of holy Repentance! Does that get you to a bit of a greater place to help the Objective understanding of your question? Hey, you have a great day. from that damn Jew boy ",

I entered the bookstore like I normally do without any objective on my mind.Then suddenly an idea hit me. (You may gain some wisdom from below)Take five books and read what is written on page 23.Here they are\u2026  Book Title: What I know for sureBy: Oprah Winfrey Getting three new pups at the same time wasn\u2019t the smartest decision I ever made. I acted on impulse, charmed by their cute little faces, intoxicated by that sweet puppy breath and the underbite on Puppy No. 3 (Layla).Then I spent weeks getting up at all hours of the night with them. I picked up pounds of poop and spent hours puppy training so they would have good manners.It was a lot of work. I was sleep deprived\u2014and constantly frazzled from trying to keep three at a time from destroying all my worldly goods. Whoa, did I gain a big new respect for mothers of real babies!All this puppy love was starting to get on my nerve, so I had to make a paradigm shift. One day while walking them, I stood and watched them frolic\u2014and I do mean frolic: rolling, tumbling, chasing, laughing (yes, dogs laugh), and leaping like bunnies. They were having so much fun, and seeing them that way made my whole body sigh, relax, and smile. New life discovering a field of grass for the first time: What a wonder! We all get the opportunity to feel wonder everyday, but we\u2019ve been lulled into numbness. Have you ever driven home from work, opened your front door, and asked yourself how you got there?I know for sure that I don\u2019t want to live a shut-down life\u2014desensitized to feeling and seeing. I want every day to be a fresh start on expanding what is possible. On experiencing joy on every level.   Book Title: The Magic of Thinking BigBy: David J. Schwartz, PH.D. How to develop the power of belief. Here are the three guides to acquiring and strengthening the power of belief: 1. Think success, don\u2019t think failure. At work, in your home, substitute success thinking for failure thinking. When you face a difficult situation, think, \u201cI\u2019ll win,\u201d not \u201cI\u2019ll probably lose.\u201d When you compete with someone else, think, \u201cI\u2019m equal to the best,\u201d not \u201cI\u2019m outclassed.\u201d When opportunity appears, think \u201cI can do it,\u201d never \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Let the master thought \u201cI will succeed\u201d dominate your thinking process. Thinking success conditions your mind to create plans that produce success. Thinking failure does the exact opposite. Failure thinking conditions the mind to think other thoughts that produce failure. 2. Remind yourself regularly that you are better than you think you are. Successful people are not supermen. Success does not require a superintellect. Nor is there anything mystical about success. And success isn\u2019t based on luck. Successful people are just ordinary folks who have developed belief in themselves and what they do. Never-yes, never\u2014sell yourself short. 3. Believe Big. The size of your success is determined by the size of your belief. Think little goals and expect little achievements. Think big goals and win big success. Remember this, too! Big ideas and big plans are often easier\u2014certainly no more difficult\u2014than small ideas and small plans.    Book Title: The Rules of WealthBy: Richard Templar Rule 10: Understand that money begets money There is no greater truth than this \u2013 money makes money. It likes clustering together. It breeds quietly and quickly like rabbits. It prefers to hang out in big groups. Money makes money. The rich get richer; the poor get poorer. That\u2019s life. Yes, it is sad. But it does seem to be a fact. Now we can work hard ourselves and do something about it or we can sit around moaning and become part of the problem. The choice, as always, is entirely yours.  MONEY MAKES MONEY.THE RICH GET RICHER  If you do want to do something about it, then it seems to make sense to me to make a tidy sum and use your money wisely to help the less fortunate than you. Or do whatever with it you so choose. Once you have some money you\u2019ll be astonished at how quickly it can grow. I recommend you understand and learn the concept of compound interest as quickly as possible. And no, I ma not going to tell you anything about it except it\u2019s vitally important that you know about it and make it a cornerstone in your building of wealth. The reason I\u2019m not going to tell you anything about it is, firstly, this isn\u2019t that sort of a book and, secondly, I\u2019m not going to do all the work for you. That would be too easy and you\u2019d learn nothing. My observation is that wealthy people get the idea of compound interest and the rest of us don\u2019t. If you spend all you get, then this Rule will never work for you; it\u2019ll never get your money working for you. You have to set aside money for breeding purposes. If you ran a rabbit farm and killed and ate all your rabbits, you wouldn\u2019t have any left to keep going. Forget the rabbit farm\u2014you\u2019re going to start a money farm. Your money will breed. You can then reinvest some and spend some but you can\u2019t spend it all or you\u2019ll have no more rabbits. Look, this stuff isn\u2019t rocket science but it is amazing how many people simply don\u2019t get it. But you do now. You have been given the best tip I can give you. Put some money aside for breeding purposes.Cream a little off for spending.Reinvest the bulk to build up a good and healthy stock.Keep it to yourself.   Book Title: LeadingBy: Sir Alex FergusonI\u2019ve always been interested in American history \u2013 both military and political \u2013 and I\u2019ve read a fair amount about Abraham Lincoln and JFK, especially the value of taking your time before making decisions. I found Doris Kearns Goodwin\u2019s book Team of Rivals: the Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln absorbing, while JFK\u2019s careful approach during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 is as fine an example of deliberate decision-making as you will find. I certainly found more virtue in patiently working towards the right decision as I got older. In my early days as a manager I could be impetuous \u2013 always in a hurry to get things done an stamp my authority on a situation. It takes courage to say, \u2018Let me think about it.\u2019When you\u2019re young you want to fly to the moon and you want to get there quickly. I think it\u2019s usually enthusiasm that causes this. As you get older you temper your enthusiasm with experience.I realise that we\u2019re shaped by lots of other forces beyond just watching, listening and reading. We\u2019re all accidental victims of our parents\u2019 DNA; we are shaped by the luck of the draw, the circumstances in which we grew up and the education we received. But we all have two sets of very powerful tools that we completely control: our eyes and our ears. Watching others, listening to their advice and reading about people are three of the best things I ever did.   Book Title: Be Your Own Best Life Coach. Know your strengths, Motivate yourself, Get rich on a not so rich salary.By: Jackee Holden 6. Question time To bring about real and lasting change get into the habit of asking yourself the right questions. The right question, well formed and asked with clear intention, will point you in the right direction. There is an art to master here. When you master the art of asking the right questions you\u2019re more than halfway there to finding your best answers. I was halfway through a coaching session with a new coaching client when she blurted out, \u2018You scare me.\u2019 As the session progressed and we explored her statement together it became clear that what was scaring her was not in fact me (I\u2019m harmless really \u2013 I promised) but the questions being pitched her way. One of the first things you will learn to do as your won best life coach is how to ask yourself the right questions and to coach yourself into a habit of self questioning on a regular basis. You\u2019ll be developing questions that both put you in touch with what you really want and help in finding the best possible ways of achieving this. Powerful questions not only change the way you think but also the choices and actions you make. You know when you\u2019ve hit upon one of those questions when you think, \u2018Oh I hadn\u2019t thought about it like that,\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s a good question,\u2019 or words or thoughts to that effect. Questions can be used to generate new possibilities and challenge old ways of thinking and behaviors, as well as validating and encouraging progress. But be prepared that when you ask the questions you\u2019re ready to listen to and take on board the answers. To keep tabs on the kinds of questions you ask, use the following checklist as a form of accountability to ensure your questions are taking you in the right direction. Will making this choice take me towards what I truly want or will it keep me stuck in my past?Am I pleasing myself or trying to please others? Does thinking about taking this action make me feel energised or do I feel drained?Will this habit or action give me short-term gratification or will I gain longer-lasting satisfaction?Am I focusing on the solution or on the problem?Are my thoughts right now self-nurturing and affirming or self-attacking or critical?Will this habit or action empower me or disempower me?Like this?

Become well-practiced in your skills and successful behavior patterns so that they become second-nature. Also, be willing to take some risks (calculated risks, not reckless risks). In most cases, your risk tolerance will decrease with age (since you have more to lose, and less time remaining to recover from losses), so take your biggest risks while still young.From others wiser than yourself \u2014 parents, grandparents, older siblings, teachers, mentors, leaders/pillars of the community, those who have earned high rank/status within an organization. Occasionally, though, one can discover nuggets of wisdom from someone much younger, even from a child. Some people can be surprisingly wise beyond their age, and if such wisdom manifests itself visibly, then by all means learn from it. Or, sometimes a child is simply \u201cbeing a child\u201d, but the child\u2019s words and/or behavior in a specific situation may somehow serve as a catalyst to \u201cgel together\u201d some not yet internalized components of wisdom acquired earlier and elsewhere.From meditation, self-reflection, internalization of the elements of wisdom gained from external sources. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean sitting on the floor in a lotus position with palms together in a prayer-like pose, although one can certainly do this if it\u2019s helpful. The important thing is to carefully organize the thoughts/ideas and try to codify/formulate them into simple, easy-to-follow rules and constructive patterns of behavior. One way to do this effectively is to sit down at a computer and type it into a personal diary entry or blog article. Or, if it works better, just use paper and a pen or pencil, which has the advantage of free-form and drawing of pictures. Perhaps a combination of all of these methods would work best.From a genuine humbleness of attitude, not just expressed externally but also felt internally. The more one learns, the more one realizes just how vast the world (and universe) is, and how very tiny one\u2019s own knowledge/wisdom is, compared to what is actually knowable. Humbleness should be practiced as quietly and subtly as possible (don\u2019t make any efforts to draw attention to it). There is a thing called \u201chumble-bragging\u201d, and a truly wise person would want to avoid engaging in it.Finally, the gaining of wisdom is an ongoing process. There should never be any moment in which one truly believes: \u201cWisdom acquired \u2014 mission accomplished! Moving on to something else\u2026\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "One can gain wisdom by asking right questions. This story of two brothers will show you \u2018how\u2019.  (Image Source : Business Insider)[1] Brothers who cofounded a $100 million company say this question their mom asked every night at dinner is what inspired their business. Bert and John Jacobs, the brothers who cofounded the $100 million Life Is Good T-shirt company, grew up the youngest of six children in a lower middle-class family in Boston. When the brothers were in elementary school, their parents were in a near-death car accident from which their mother managed to escape with just a few broken bones \u2014 but their father lost the use of his right hand. The stress and frustration from his physical therapy caused him to develop a harsh temper. \"He did a lot of yelling when we were in grade school,\" John writes in his new book \u2018Life Is Good.\u2019. And life certainly wasn't perfect. \"There were often difficult things happening around the house,\" the brothers write. But their mom, Joan, still believed life was good. So, every night as the family sat around the dinner table, she would ask her six kids to tell her something good that happened that day. As simple as mom's words were, they changed the energy in the room. Before we knew it, we were all riffing on the best, funniest, or most bizarre part of our day. John says that this daily exercise prevented them from developing a victim's mentality of \"Oh, you wouldn't believe this horrible thing that happened to me today.\" Instead of griping about a teacher or homework assignment, he says that they would be laughing about a silly haircut a classmate got that day, or a neat project they worked on at school. That optimism was something that our family always had, even when we had little else. Growing up with a mother like theirs \u2014 one who sang in the kitchen, told animated stories, and acted out children's books for them, no matter what bad situation they were going through \u2014 taught them an important lesson: Being happy isn't dependent on your circumstances. She showed us that optimism is a courageous choice you can make every day, especially in the face of adversity. They say her unwavering positive outlook on life is what inspired Life Is Good \u2014 their $100 million company the mission of which is to spread the power of optimism, with the tagline, \"Life is not perfect. Life is not easy. Life is good.\" Since their mother's daily question served them so well in life, John says he and his brother now ask their employees the same thing when they all come together \u2014 \"Tell me something good\" \u2014 and the results have been positive. He explains, It leads to ideas, which lead to progress, which leads to building on successes, instead of dwelling on challenges. This nightly routine of asking \u201ctell me something good\u201d went a long way. \u201cIt is not the answer that enlightens, but the question.\u201d \u2013 Eugene Ionesco Footnotes[1] Brothers who cofounded a $100 million company say a question their mom asked every night at dinner inspired their business",

            "answer_text": "I believe the only path which leads to wisdom is in the acceptance of personal responsibility for our mistakes and also our own pain no matter whatever anybody else contributed to it all. In this concept of personal responsibility, our mistakes become opportunities to discover what we obviously did not know and most desperately needed to know to at the very least, prevent our self from repeating the same mistakes, and that is exactly what is necessary so that we can learn and grow from our life experiences. Also, personal responsibility for our pain is what will give birth to a new capacity foe empathy and compassion that would never have been achievable any other way, and a new capacity to care and love is naturally acquired which places the well being and happiness of those we care for first and above anything we might need from them. Learning to love is to have acquire the ability to give love where it is needed the most, including to some who may be most desperate for having made terrible mistakes, and may appear and even believe them self as being unworthy and undeserving of love. A transformation takes place which transform us into becoming true assets to the world, and it is experience with a new appreciation, love, and respect for life that we know could never have been achieve any other way other than for everything to have happened exactly as it all did, including all the bad and all the pain. It is a process in which the challenge of life is accepted as a quest for what is true and in which understanding is everything. At first, small understandings by them self may not amount to much and we cannot even be sure they are true and accurate, but if they bring about any degree of relief from pain, or any degree of direction, we set them aside very much the same as if they were similar jig-saw puzzle pieces that we somehow know must in some way, fit together. And if we persist, over time, these different understandings begin to connect everything together and very much the same like an ever increasingly enlarging assembly of jig-saw puzzle pieces will form an ever clearer picture, so will these understandings connect everything together and form an ever enlarging mental image that cannot be directly communicated or be mistaken for anything else but what is true and reality itself, and it is an image that never stop from continuing to expand in a way which continues to be increasingly revealing and amazing. It must have been a very wise man who made the claim a very long time ago that, \u201cThere can be no freedom without responsibility\u201d and there has been many people since then, who were able to discover and confirm this to be very true. Ultimately, it will be regrets for the mistakes we made, including mistakes we did not even know we we were making, which had negative or destructive effects especially to the people who needed us and especially love from us, is the only true source of wisdom.

            "answer_text": "I'm going to write something that disagrees with the dictionary definition of wisdom a bit. It may be my own working definition rather than anything traditional. Wisdom is not (despite what Socrates is alleged to have felt) knowledge ABOUT any particular thing. It is not a scholastic study, a body of learning nor a technique. A person may know a lot about individual things and still be lacking in wisdom. They can be one of the world's great experts in a field or even several fields and still lack wisdom.  It would be difficult to display wisdom if you knew nothing at all about particular things but that isn't wisdom. Knowledge is not intelligence: there are very clever people who are damn fools.  What I mean by wisdom is the ability to put the things you know into context. To relate the things you know to each other and to the world in which that knowledge has its existence. To know how to judge the claims of economic development against those of environmental risk and those of cultural change would require wisdom.  Wisdom is seeing the big picture. We never, ever get enough wisdom to see the whole picture: perfect wisdom isn't within human achievement. But we can work on it.  How you gain it is more complex. Some people seem to have it naturally in some areas, most of us have to work on it all our lives.  There are prerequisites. Humility is one, the admission that your own viewpoint is necessarily limited. That implies you need to be able to admit that you have been wrong and to listen to people you disagree with. A willingness to go on learning your whole life long.  Part of the core of wisdom is prudence, which I often describe as a sort of 'weaponised cowardice'. Being aware of the things that can go wrong is a defence against enthusiasm.  But courage also part of wisdom: the willingness to take chances and hope for a better future.  As to how you acquire it: practice, practice, practice. Always try to see how what you know fits in with other things and what you have just learned fits in with what you already know.  ",

            "answer_text": "When one is to leave the gym after intensive training, they do not gain muscle in their rest; the muscles already exist inside their bodies. All they do is to expand in accordance to the stimulation they were given. No new muscles are added, as they only grow. The same goes for wisdom. We all contain different potentials at various of degrees. All we need for their development is specific stimulation that will trigger their blossom; each stimulation to each potential. Muscles can be gained either by external stimulation (lifting weights, for example), or through self-sufficient stimulation (doing push ups, stretching, so forth). The same goes for wisdom as said before. Interact with wisdom-developing stimulations, or challenge yourself through the Art of Philosophizing, and the seeds within you shall gradually grow. Wisdom can be gained through every possible thing, since wisdom feeds on knowledge, and everything is knowledge, everything is information. Whether real or false, physical or illusion, everything in existence and non-existence is of information that can be used for the construction of wisdom. Wisdom is the optimal execution of knowledge, regardless of what is the nature of the said knowledge. Every fruit you may find on your journey could be used as a potentially healthy and tasty salad. Either collect or create knowledge through interactions (externally), contemplations (internally), or through the combination of them. Remember that the same station can be reached through various of ways, and thus there it is not necessary to reach a state through all the possible ways. Make sure you are to rest after an intensive sessions, and don\u2019t exhaust yourself, or else the muscle will not only stop to grow but might also deteriorate and minimize itself. The same applies goes for wisdom. I myself need, at times, complete days to distract and entertain myself, so my mental energies required for philosophizing shall recharge. Therefore there is no shame in killing time, if that time serves for recharging oneself for ultimately be productive and efficient. Thanks to BRandon IOI for requesting my wisdom. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question! One philosophers have been thinking about for centuries. There is no one set formula for gaining wisdom but in my experience I have found that several factors can help: Interact with different people: Don\u2019t simply associate with people who are just like you and think just like you. Interacting with people from different walks of life and people who have different ideas about life than you do (in religion and politics for example) will provide you with some interesting insights about the world. Spend time in nature: Thinkers like Emerson and Thoreau recognized the value of nature in coming to a deep understanding about life. Read Walden and spend some time in the woods! Meditate: This technique has been around for centuries. It is good for cultivating mindfullness and can potentially lead to other deep insights about yourself and the world. Make connections among different subjects: Wisdom comes, in part, from the recognition of the deep interconnectedness of things: people, places, history, ideas, and life. So, start looking for those connections in what you learn and experience. Travel: Finally, a good way to enhance your perspective on life is to travel. See different people, places, and sights and you will gain a \u201cworldly\u201d perspective which will help you cultivation of wisdom. Read good books: Both fiction and non-fiction provide a rich source of wisdom that you can use for insight. In particular, great books which have withstood the test of time are some of the best sources for wisdom. Consider reading some great works of literature as well as works of philosophy and history. Here\u2019s a few suggestions: How Should We Live? Great Ideas from the Past for Everyday Life by Roman Krznaric Walden or Life in the Woods by Henry David Thoreau Nichomachean Ethics by Aristotle 30 Lessons for Living: Tried and True Advice from the Wisest Americans by Karl Pillemer 29 Gifts: How a Month of Giving Can Change Your Life by Cami Walker The Spiritual Teachings of Ralph Waldo Emerson by Richard Geldard Obliquity: Why our goals are best achieved indirectly by John Kay ",

            "answer_text": "At the time of Heraclitus, a student of Pythagoras (~535-475 BCE) so-called \"wisdom poetry\" was already thousands of years old.   Heraclitus, who would concur with Einstein that energy is the essence of matter, also said:  \"All things change to fire and fire exhausted falls back into things.\"  Einstein used mathematical language E=MC2 to say it and this was later confirmed by scientific experience.  This might lead one to conclude that Heraclitus was wise beyond his age (all things considered). Here are some of the (translated) passages from Heraculitus that survived time. \"Wisdom is the oneness of mind that guides and permeates all things\" \"Applicants for Wisdom, do what I have done; inquire within.\" I might just comment, before the rest of these selected quotes, that first thing you will need is a strong dose of humility.  You have to reach deep into your psyche for this.  It only comes from within yourself.  Getting at it is in no way easy or graceful; on the contrary it is excruciating.  Most fail.  You must be mindful that the search is a process and wisdom is an objective (the idea) and you must search for it in order to get to know it; to grasp a measure for yourself. \"The habit of knowledge is not human, but divine.\" \"Yet, let's not make rash guesses our most lucid thoughts.\" \"The harmony past knowing sounds more deeply than the known\" Form this habit by getting into the habit of being thankful, gracious and just being the mindful instrument that you are.  Keep an even, open mind; don't be superficial.  Be mindful.  Recognize. Discern; think deeply. Strengthen your habit in the silence of meditation, contemplation and supplication (if only to stay your tongue) and realize it in thankfulness and gratefulness.  Don't substitute or satiate your objective for your silly preferences. \"Seekers of Wisdom first need sound intelligence.\" \"While Cosmic Wisdom understands all things are good and just, intelligence may find injustice here and justice somewhere else.\" \"To be even-minded is the greatest virtue.\" \"Since mindfulness, of all things, is the ground of all being, to speak one's true mind and to keep things known in common, serves all being, just as laws made clear, uphold the city. \"Of all the pronouncements of the law, the one source is the word whereby we choose what helps true mindfulness prevail\". (word=logos)  \"The word proves those first hearing it as numb to the understanding as the one\u2019s who have not heard. Yet all things follow from the word.\" Additional comments: In the beginning was the Word.\u201d  In this diction, in the Gospel according to John, he must have had Heraclitean thought in mind.  The Logos induces not only the lexical word or terms of reference, but also all means of making known, as well as its objectives; the phenomena to which ideas respond, and the rules that govern both phenomena and ideas.    When people hear and use words these days, it is through their ordinary language where words are supposed to be arbitrary labels of things.  The means of making known is taken for granted; the objective is forgotten or superseded by the latest fad or what the celebrity said.  Many don't even suspect that mental and behavioral phenomena respond to ideas and virtually no one recalls or remembers the rules that govern both. In short, what was at one time, common sense, is not so common anymore.  Yet, as Heraculitus also said: \"From the strain of binding opposites comes harmony.\" ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very important question. Perhaps the most important question in the universe. But of course, I could be wrong. I don\u2019t know if I can answer this question satisfactorily, but I am willing to try if you are willing to bear with me. As I understand it, wisdom is the combination of intelligence and knowledge with the intention of applying it for good, ethical and righteous (not self-righteous) purposes. Intelligence is something we are all born with to varying degrees, but is not static - i.e it is not entirely dependent on genetic precursors; it can be expanded and improved upon through mental exercise (similar to working out in the gym to build physical muscle). Knowledge is something we each must work for through various means. Education is not achieved exclusively through the education system - school, college, university - it is a process of self-directed-learning as part of a personally developed \u2018discovery-enriched curriculum\u2019. In the modern age we live in, where information is readily available through the internet or the public library, this is surely not beyond the reach of anyone who is passionate about knowledge. In the search for knowledge, I can recommend a good place to begin - that is the science of Human Temperament. Personally I subscribe to the original system of temperament classification laid down by Hippocrates (around 450BC) - based on the Four Humors, otherwise known as the four body fluids - phlegm (Phlegmatic), blood (Sanguine), bile from liver (Choleric) and bile from kidneys (Melancholy). The link is Four classic temperaments and spirituality. I prefer the Hippocratic system because it is easily disseminated/shared and you don\u2019t have to be a psychologist to understand the principles and put them into practice. By this process of understanding the temperaments we gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the other people around us. Therefore we progress in our evolutionary development. But of course we need to be aware that \u2018nobody fits into a box\u2019 and I prefer to think of people as \u201cmaybe this AND this AND that\u201d rather than \u201cthis OR that\u201d. Temperamental traits are inherited largely through our grandparents and more distant ancestors (often the traits of our parents tend to skip a generation or even two), and we may inherit traits or characteristics of further-removed ancestors from two, three, or even four of the four main temperament classes. Hence, a person\u2019s temperamental makeup is diverse and complex, but understandable given time, observation and interest. Naturally, for a student of temperament theory who has achieved the state of Unconscious Competence, the process of \u2018diagnosing\u2019 the temperamental makeup of \u2018others\u2019 is less time-consuming as they are more likely to \u2018sense\u2019 a person\u2019s predominant temperament through an intuitive process borne of long experience and expertise, or even to detect a sense of \u2018chemistry\u2019 when encountering another person, especially if the other person has a similar temperamental makeup to the observer (like attracts like and opposites repel). This has been my experience since I started this journey twenty years ago, however one must never become complacent or judgmental by ignoring the need for observation and analysis before attempting to construct a working hypothesis. As for the idea of \u2018personality\u2019 and its construction, this is a discussion for another day as it includes many factors - with temperament as the foundation, but also the influences of culture, religion, politics, family background, perceived economic and social status, and many other considerations including the notion of \u2018personal choice\u2019 when it comes to a person\u2019s personality and personal identity. Naturally, a person can only make an informed \u2018choice\u2019 about their personality and who they want to be, if they have the necessary knowledge to inform that choice. The acquisition of knowledge is not an easy process but our confidence is further helped along by an understanding of Competence Theory. According to this theory, we progress through various stages of competence until we reach the final stage where we are competent without needing to think about it \u2013 i.e the knowledge has been mastered and becomes a matter of instinct and intuition. For example, when we are children and we first learn to ride a bicycle, or as young adults learning to drive a car for the first time. We begin in the state of Unconscious Incompetence (we don\u2019t know that we don\u2019t know or how much we don\u2019t know). From there we work at it and reach the stage of Conscious Incompetence (We start to find out what we don\u2019t know, how much we don\u2019t know, and what it is that we need to know). The next leg of the journey is Conscious Competence, as we practice more and become good at what we do provided we concentrate and focus our attention on the task at hand. The final stage is that of Unconscious Competence \u2013 where we simply jump on our bicycle and go for a ride without thinking about the process of what to do first, how to maintain balance or how to use gears etc. In driving a car at this stage you may have your mind on other matters and suddenly find yourself having arrived at the destination with no clear memory of the journey. Some folks arrive at the stage of Unconscious Competence faster than others, depending on temperamental makeup, mental acuity through discipline, and other factors including physiological and mental health. There is much that can be done to accelerate the process. So wisdom is about combining intelligence and wisdom to do good. But how do we know what is good? There are various philosophical discourses about Ethics. Utilitarianism seems to be the dominant system in terms of governmentality as it generally aims to achieve \u2018the greatest good for the greatest number of people\u2019 (and never mind about those marginalised minority individuals who \u2018fall through the cracks\u2019). I am partial to Ethics of care and Ethics of Virtue, however my main focus has always been on the notion of \u2018sustainability\u2019 in that the ethical standards must be safe for everyone to practice without having any harmful effect to the local community or the broader society in general. For example, before I commit a certain act I tend to ask myself \u201cwhat would happen if everyone were to do the same as me?\u201d (my basis starts with Kant\u2019s theory of Deontology). I recall an incident in my childhood where a friend challenged me to steal a bottle of Coca Cola from our neighbourhood corner store. We knew that the shopkeeper was out the back doing stocktake, and the chance of getting caught was slim, but I refused the challenge because I realised that my action could encourage others to do the same, and perhaps more expensive items would go \u2018missing\u2019 which over time may cause the shop owner to go bankrupt and close the store. I did not refuse because I was afraid of getting caught, that my parents and the Police would punish me and I would be made to feel bad (these are wrong reasons to CTR (Choose The Right). I refused because I was afraid the shop would close due to the \u2018snowball\u2019 effect which I had started, and then the entire neighbourhood would be disadvantaged without the convenience of a corner store. I also considered the impact on the shop owner and his family, as he my have faced financial hardship and ruin, thereby denying his children the chance to attend college or university. Even from a young age, I was intuitively aware of the importance of this notion of \u2018sustainability\u2019. Such ideas should be taught to children from the time they start at Kindergarten, and then on through Primary School (Elementary school for our American friends), onto high school, college and university. I hope I have at least partially answered the question of \u201chow does one truly gain wisdom\u201d. The only other remark I can make is that in my opinion wisdom is borne of disciplined thinking and ethical choices. To achieve true wisdom we must firstly arrive at a state of \u2018higher-evolved-consciousness\u2019 through the pain and suffering of lived experience. In short, \u2018growing pains\u2019 or \u2018teething pains\u2019 cannot be avoided unless we want to stop growing or stop teething. This is how humans learn. In my personal opinion, Quora is a wonderful repository of knowledge, and I am passionate in my conviction that knowledge should always be shared freely and free of charge as we try to help each other long the path of life as we know it on this planet.

            "answer_text": "How To Crack Your Inner Wisdom:  Do you ever feel like you trust your gut almost to a 100%, but your heart and your mind are not on the same page? Sometimes the decisions you would like to make become a dragged out dilemma to the point of debilitation. It is a tough sentiment to get through, believe me. You are not alone. This is a problem that plagues a lot of people from achieving their full potential. The problems start when we listen too much to outside noises and believing that those voices have a point. We start to think that we are doing it wrong. The reason for it is due to a basic lack of self-esteem and confidence to say that: NO! YOU are the one that is doing it wrong. On a personal level, this had defined my teens through school and even into my early 20s and I felt I was a prisoner in my own mind only to develop the proper mental frame and mechanism. Ever since the decision to target these mental games, my personal and mental development has been light years of a difference for myself. Self-esteem is at an all time high and I feel more than 150% confident about whom I am as an individual. It is such a powerful feeling. It really is all mental\u200a\u2014\u200athe mind is a powerful tool and a powerful weapon. We ultimately have the power to change it. It really is in our hands and a simple honest talk with yourself every day could go a long way. What is Inner Wisdom/Voice? It is a tool for quick and ready insight. It is a gut feeling, a 6th sense, an inner knowing. It is almost instinctual. It is a feeling of that particular situation \u201cfeeling right\u201d. It is an unexplainable feeling at times. Listening to ourselves can get tricky. Often our inner wisdom is a mere whisper. It is a murmur that is especially hard to hear over your harsh inner critic.\u200b Some of the readers may argue that sometimes that inner voice is the one that needs to be tamed and may be that inner voice is even stopping themselves from achieving great things due to fear of failure. The key? Map it out. This does not have to be serious. You can play and experiment and pivot to see what messages you get and may be logic could come into play to dictate. How to Listen to Your Inner Wisdom \u200bLet\u2019s look at how to connect to your inner wisdom. 1. Calm down. When my mind is calm, the connection to my inner wisdom is the strongest. When my mind is in turmoil, I do not try to make any decisions, but to let it subside and to just let it go! I let my mind run wild through many scenarios freely, until the calmness approaches and it does, because the mind is a muscle and that muscle will get tired. Sometimes and unfortunately, negativity comes into the picture. It is NORMAL to have your ups & downs. Remember you are human. It would be unnatural if it was otherwise. If I find myself in a negative state, I might go for a run, listen to powerful and inspirational music, immediately read inspirational short-stories, quotes and people or meditate. Personally, I do not try to suppress the negativity but really just take a break and to exhale.\u200b When you take a break, even for a minute or two to blink, gradually your calm will return along with the connection to your wisdom. 2. Stop Forcing It. I cannot stand it when I hear excuses about why something could not be done and even more so when I fall into that trap. I want to figure it all out. I want to force results, and I want to have achieved my goals last year. The more you force something, the more slowly things happen and sometimes they do not happen at all. This does not mean to be complacent. Not at all and to never ever further mean that persistence is useless. Persistence is VITAL to achieving your full potential. In everything you do from relationships to your workplace and all aspects of life. Fighting for what you want is the essence to connecting to your inner wisdom and the essence of success in general. \u201cStop Forcing it\u201d means being aware of what you could control and what you do not. And it goes back to calming down. When you are worried about what might go wrong in life and you\u2019re trying to fix an imaginary problem, the connection to your wisdom, mind and heart is detached. But once you learn to become aware that you do not know where life is going, you can relax and control the decisions that you make on that specific day and in that specific time. 3. Patience. My inner wisdom shines when I am patient. In the public eye, my patience is well understood. Behind the scenes, however, I have a fire that rages from within. I want to win and want to win now. I am competitive. I hate to lose. Sometimes to the point where I lose sleep over it and other times to the point where I grit my teeth. When you are in the weeds with something or grinding hard at work, sometimes we fail to see what the bigger picture is about. Understand what your \u201cend goal\u201d is. Again we do not know where life is going. It is scary to grasp. But its also beautiful. Take a step back and let your mind and heart dictate how you feel about a particular idea or situation. The more distance you give something, your inner wisdom shines. It takes time, but you will definitely know that feeling. Pitfalls The biggest pitfall I fall into over and over is stressing about whether or not I am on the right path. This \u201cworry\u201d has plagued me ever since I was 16 years old. I broke myself down to the core, went through a period of self-analysis and self-critique. I was brutal with myself and my own harshest critic throughout the happiest periods of people\u2019s lives (a.k.a college). I felt like I was missing out on living and what was worse, I was comparing myself to others and that is the most self-defeating. Lessons Learned I am fortunate to have a very large circle of friends. I am even more fortunate to have a very close inner-circle. That inner-circle was the extreme opposite of myself. They were \u201cfree\u201d. They believed that life will work itself out; to take it a day at a time and to let go of the tight self-imposed constraints. I have observed their attitudes and have molded and adapted it to my own personal characteristics. IT WAS SUCH A CONCEPT. I had the belief that if you did not stress about whether you are or not on the right path, then you just did not care. It was a false assumption to make. I have come to accept that life will take me where I need to go. I can only do my best with what I have and only so much I could control. Surround yourself with good people who have your best intentions at heart. Surround yourself with great friends. Most importantly, surround yourself with friends who have differing personalities and outlooks on life than you do. You could learn so much from them. What You Need to Remember I mapped out my life (my 20s to age 30) at the age of 16. I had it all laid out\u200a\u2014\u200afrom entering university at age 17 to finishing in 3 years (which I did), to being a multi-millionaire by the age of 25 to having my empire at the age of 30. I LOVED planning it out. It gave me joy. It made me feel like I cared more than anyone else about where I want to go. It is important to have goals. I always have goals. What people fall into (I, included) is attaching timelines to everything. This caused stress and anxiety if those timelines were not met. Let it go. Goals provide structure and your inner voice provides that map. Figuring this out at the age of 25 has been liberating. My inner wisdom has shined and now I feel like I could clearly control my destiny with decisions to make, with the awareness that life may throw a wrench into your plans. You must understand how to get up when you get knocked down. ",

            "answer_text": "Empirical experience will first and foremost be the main agent here. While logical training and education are also necessary, they\u2019ll never really mean anything and you\u2019ll never really internalize the significance or learn to use said knowledge unless it becomes salient through first-hand experience. I think a good place to begin would be to develop an actively adaptable and evolving personal manifesto to live by. Stoicism sets a good foundation because it teaches us to not let ourselves be bothered by what is outside of our control but also to take virtuous action when it is within our abilities to do so. This is in and of itself quite powerful, but it\u2019s not quite that simple. In order to learn to determine what is within our control and what the right course of action to take is is where things get more complicated. To develop this skill will be an ongoing never ending journey involving putting yourself out there in the real world, taking on challenges, meeting new people and remaining open minded. This in addition to voracious reading will be a good place to begin. As someone who has studied philosophy both in university and on my own time, I love diving into widely varying schools of thought and trying to determine for myself what is true and what is right. Another benefit to studying different philosophies is that you\u2019ll notice patterns and similarities between them and thereby can come closer to uncovering universal truths and values. For some people some of the more in depth post-modernistic teachings can seem a little like mental masturbation and maybe be unnervingly deconstructionist. For some it\u2019s depressing and for others they simply wonder what the point is. I personally love reading the works of Derrida and Foucault as a challenge and as a means of furthering my ability to reason through problems, as they are incredibly insightful and rigorous thinkers. While I accept the fact that we can never be certain of anything (except perhaps consciousness) and that Moral objectivity doesn\u2019t exist. I believe it is our ethical duty to try and come as close to moral objectivity as we can and to do our best to determine universal truths and values (to the best of our abilities). I believe my extensive background in stoicism allows me to look at it this way and is why I am unafraid of tackling any philosophical idea no matter how bleak or challenging it may seem. A lot of wisdom comes down to mindfulness which can be achieved through meditation and meditative activities as well as knowledge of logic and rationality, consider also keeping some sort of journal, blog or diary as means of there really is no substitute for writing as a means of organizing your thoughts and developing your ideas. Combine this with the empirical experiences of taking on knew challenges, making friends, travelling, relationships, growing older and I think you\u2019re on the right track to wisdom. ",

            "answer_text": "Go to the source. Ask for it. It\u2019s that simple.  What source? How shall such a request be made? Well, if there is such a thing as wisdom, and if such stuff is attainable, then it must be available via the world we live in. That is not to say it belongs to the universe we experience, but it does mean that it can be communicated through it. By analogy, Light is not the vacuum of space, but it can be transmitted by it. Indeed, \u2018information\u2019 is entirely meta-physical. There is no sense in which substances and their energies make sense of their substances and energies. Frequencies are not music. However, music is made of frequencies when such periods are provided with purpose. What is the purpose of the Universe? Is there one? If not, then everything is meaningless - and even the sentence \u2018everything is meaningless\u2019 communicates nothing. However, if there is an intentionality to what we experience as events in time then surely the medium through which such expression emerges can conduct conversation in more than one way? Phases can be inverted, after all. The really fascinating thing is that they can appear unchanged even where that occurs. That\u2019s how things seem to stand\u2026  With all this in mind, it is a habit of mine to do the following - hopefully each day. LORD, if it be your will, please grant me wisdom. Not for my glory, but for yours. Who am I referring to? I am using a name to invoke the Name Above All Names. That is ironic, to be sure. However, my own name depends merely on my recognition of it, not the user\u2019s use. To some I am \u2018doctor\u2019, to others I am \u2018Dave\u2019, to one I am \u2018daddy\u2019. They are all the same person, and none of them captures the whole. Am I only speaking to emptiness? If so, then nothing is lost - and only some humility is learned. The practice teaches me that wisdom does not dwell in my own determinations - Everything is beyond me and it is my responsibility to reach out to it. If there is a source of all that is True, though, then my appeal to it constitutes the most basic of logical operations - a reference to an Axiom. In fact, one might call the inquiry above the most essential proof of meaningful existence.  ",

            "answer_text": "Wisdom, unlike knowledge, is taking knowledge and applying it properly. For example, I have many years of living and education, including two doctorate degrees. One could say that I have a lot of knowledge. However, to turn this into wisdom is a different thing. Wisdom is the proper application of knowledge. I spend time with older, mature, experienced people in the field I am hoping to learn about. For example, as a clergyman, I gain my knowledge from books and personal study. I gain wisdom from spending time one-on-one with older, more experienced Christian men whose life experiences have taken them places I can only imagine. There are also areas of life outside my vocation. In no way am I mechanically inclined. To gain wisdom about my car and how it works, when I take it to the shop, I ask my mechanic about what he is doing, what is wrong, how I can avoid future problems, and about other projects he is working on. In this case, while he is not older, he is wiser than I am because he has been doing this work for over thirty years. Do not be proud in your search for wisdom. Be humble and willing to learn from any source available. I commend you in your desire to search for wisdom. It was the only thing that Solomon, the wisest man to ever live, asked God to grant him when he was told he could have anything he wished. ",

            "answer_text": "How does one gain wisdom? By distillation. Step one, gather data. Step two, reiterate step one until there is a context where the data can provide temporal information. (Data to information conversion). Step three, keep reiterating step one and two, until the data reenforces the information and the information can be set to fact or general rule (within its own context our outside of it). Step four, keep reiterating step one and two and three, until the fact or general rule sublimates into a greater step which transcends the context or its surrounding fields. The outcome becomes a \u2018rule\u2019 so broad it can be used in all observations and deductions. Consider the following wisdom I obtained as a motto: \u2018When Logically inclined, Honesty frames the view of Reason\u2019 As you, and others, I have observed life, I have observed reality, I have observed myself and everything and everyone I interacted with. Slowly, after many iterations I came to ethical stances that are undisputable, simply based on very basic information found in reality. This was not wisdom, it was simply information turned into rules for myself to ease my interaction with the world around me. Then after a lot of time, I found out that everytime I observed implementing my rules, some were not holding up in general, and others would need adjustment, or elaboration to make sure I was conscious of the effects. Eventually I found out that honesty, real honesty starts with yourself. It can\u2019t start anywhere else. But most of use are individuals based on the information and \u2018rules\u2019 presented to us by others. When we are not honest, we will not interrogate those rules and that information and try to figure out the reality sense of it. So, when we are honest, we are able to adjust our logic to be useful. But, then it also means that to have logic have any usefulness we have to accept its intrinsic value. 1+1=2. Not so much the characters represented by the meaning of the value of data. One finger, plus one finger, is two fingers. 1 bus plus 1 bus, no matter how many passengers, are still two busses. This is logic. When we are logically forced to accept something as fact, whether by context or general rule of observation/knowledge, we can either be honest and reason along this line, or be dishonest and deny the logic to be logical. If you say: No, 1+1 can also be 1, because if someone marries someone, they become one. Or No, 1+1 is three, because after having sex, you make another life and that is 3, you are dishonest in a very painful way. 1+1 is a mathematical equation of the simplest form. It means add 1 value item to 1 value item of the same sort and gain how many value items of the same value: which is two of them. Even the Egyptians understood this, Chinese and Aztec understood this. It is a logic that is valid. Now, we can decide to be dishonest, even against all logic, but there is always a reason for such dishonesty. And here comes the wisdom part: When you are reasonable, you understand that when you are honest, logic will tell you the emotionalless equation. You can still add emotion, but remember that that reason is our cognitive faculty, not our emotional one. Wisdom is accepting all knowledge and working that exists in nature and understand its dependency and accept it without trying to evaluate it emotionally. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, that question is what the Greeks searched for endlessly, and never found. Philosophy was what they ended up with to replace wisdom with. It is not an even close substitute. Let me explain a bit about myself so you can see where I am coming from. I am a Jew so obviously don't do bible. I am also a Mishnah Jew - (oral concept taught only) - Jew; but saying that doesn't mean I don't understand the foolishness of those who do. Mishnah Jews are like the Example of Moses . . . no books, no religious teachers, no scrolls, no temples or church building to attend/but rather Objective Understanding of the desire of Ruach HaKodesh Himself ,you know; the (\u201cBurning Bush\u201d style) instead. Period In Solomon\u2019s Temple there were two fires always present to see and / and ponder chimera over. The first was/is called the \u2018consuming fire\u2019/the much larger of the two. The second fire was/is called the \u2018inner fire\u2019, much smaller, but a much, much,much more powerful one.Hamashiach Himself, displayed/showed that very thing, with evidence, in A.D. 33 in Yerusalem, early in the morning, on/at the festival of first fruits: before the/an entire city; filled with visitors from all over the surrounding cities watching it for hours. Now to the question. Wisdom can not be found in the brain and it\u2019s computer style \u2018dry\u2019 answer and/ that which it always has to call in from it\u2019s emotions department, to make the \u2018dry\u2019 answer palatable. Those emotions work like a \u2018fireworks\u2019 show. They can be most exciting to watch the display itself, hear the giant BOOMs, and are really damn easy to get excited about sometimes, and/or often. The issue is that the \u2018fireworks\u2019 of emotions always leave within, and behind it a damn cloud of \u2018smoke\u2019. It will always prevent (by that smokescreen it very self) the ability to see Wisdom. Wisdom is not a \u2018thing\u2019, but rather a bonafide holy being. We bona fide Jews know him as Ruach HaKodesh. The one of whom it is said \u2018in the beginning was the Word, The Word was with G-d and was G-d, and of \u2018all\u2019 things created, nothing was created without Him. (please don\u2019t confuse that with Judaism) Hamashiach Himself gave the only answer that/which actually works when He spoke \u2018Repent, Receive the Holy Ghost\u2019. It seems like a simple answer, but Mystery Babylon is the example of failure to that very thing. That will be exactly why her last day will rise up in smoke. Religion has turned that into a damn joke! . . . They will never find Wisdom. Wisdom is also known as the \u2018new covenant\u2019 (holy understanding) Yahshua was the \u2018delivery boy\u2019 Himself of. The religion of Judaism, not unlike Mystery Babylon . . . bent it over, and drove it around the block until they killed Her. All religion works off of \u2018brain smarts\u2019, and, \u2018smarter than smarts\u2019, The snake oil salesman in Eden sold those very two things for his living. He used his \u2018educational Docotrate\u2019 along with his never matched \u2018finishing school\u2019 well learned language of Schmooze; Mystery Babylon does the very exact same thing, always has and will till she goes up in smoke. (very soon to come) In Solomon\u2019s (the wisest mortal know before Hamashiach) Temple there were \u2018twin fires\u2019. The larger one \u2018the consuming fire\u2019; the smaller one \u2018the inner fire\u2019. The consuming fire was big, and powerful enough to destroy. The smaller fire was much smaller, \u2018the inner fire\u2019 . . . but was/is much, much, much more powerful that the consuming fire, but grows \u2018life itself\u2019, and is not destructive in it\u2019s manner. Wisdom is the smaller fire given to ponder the chimera of Wisdom, it\u2019s her bona fide value and usage of her. Misusing / misrepresenting / and or \u2018shortchanging the \u2018inner fire\u2019 IS \u201cBlasphemy of the Holy Ghost. Cheapen it and you also will go up in smoke. That being well said . . . Wisdom is found by \u2018repenting\u2019 - cleaning forever out of your heart and gut - the \u2018dross\u2019 (pure, plain old poop of both religion, and society\u2019s methods of getting those \u2018brain smarts, and smarter than smarts\u2019). You gotta dump forever the \u2018book crap\u2019, the educational \u2018degree chasing crap\u2019, and the finishing school schmooze, manipulation crap. That is exactly what \u2018Repent\u2019 means. ( and that means permanently) That puts you in good shape to ask our Creator, Our Father in heaven for the gift of holy \u2018Wisdom. Ask Him and He will give you Wisdom. If you are trying to golden bullshit Him, He can smell that crap instantly, and you\u2019ll never receive her. Wisdom works from her Throne,(her Chair, well guarded by her) . . . If you are schmoozing in any leftover \u2018stink\u2019; the door to her will remain closed. Her Throne is the smack dab center of a \u2018pure heart\u2019, and cleaned out \u2018gut\u2019. She never, or ever works from the \u2018brain\u2019 or it\u2019s fireworks display of \u2018emotions\u2019. Period. That is my holy \u2018gut level\u2019 answer (: You can take that check to the bank and cash it! The check is good. That is the Wisdom of holy Repentance! Does that help you to some a larger spot to assist the Objective comprehension of your concern? Hi, you've got an excellent day. from that damn Jew boy ",

The person who desires to be wise and continuously work for it will surely become wise. Lord Krishna has dealt with this question beautiful in the great book: The Pad were Kita. This can be achieved the following practises: do your duty with utmost interest. Your objective should be only to perform it to the best of your ability. You should not be connected or attached to the results that you are going to get. If you do so your actions will be polluted by your attachment and will not be as effective and smooth as these can be without attachment.Quest for knowledge should be your Moto all the time. In fact it\u2019s so interesting when you make it your habit that you will not like to live without quest for knowledge.fortunately for us today there is so much of is attached to research and desire to know more which was never there at any time. For anything in every problem one had to go to the library search the concerned book and search that particular portion in which you will find the answer question that you may be having in mind.Play all this is available at the click of the mouse. Google, Wikipedia, Cora Cora and many other useful websites are there to help you to answer any of your searching efforts.Control your senses with your soul. What does it mean? It means they don\u2019t hanker after the worldly pleasures. These are transient.There are many other things that you can do. If you are a serious Sikar, read the Bhagvad Gita.

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a distinct difference between wisdom and knowledge. Your question was about wisdom, but I thought I\u2019d draw a comparison for the sake of clarity. Knowledge is something your absorb from reading, lectures or discussions. Wisdom is only gained through personal experience. Life wisdom is gained when one takes the time to reflect on life experiences to detect behavior patterns, and shifts his behavior in a good way based on the learning he finds in those patterns. The more life experiences one accumulates, and the more time spent in reflection, the greater the wisdom. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve heard the term \u201cwise elders\u201d to refer to people who have been through a lot, and freely share their wisdom. Western society, unfortunately, doesn\u2019t seem to put much stock in elder wisdom. By the time one reaches 50 he/she is often considered \u201cover the hill\u201d; has far fewer career opportunities available; and is sometimes ignored by his younger family. I\u2019ve witnessed the effect of discreet age discrimination in Fortune 50 companies - they don\u2019t want to run afoul of laws, yet they want to provide some upward mobility for their younger managers - so they offer a sweetheart buyout to older employees who have been excellent, loyal, consistent performers throughout their career. And in the process, cast off years of process or project wisdom for theoretical or academic knowledge. A bad trade. By comparison, in Asia it\u2019s common to have 3 or 4 generations living under the same roof. Sometimes it\u2019s financial, but it\u2019s always seen as an example to expose the kids to their grandparents\u2019 or great-grandparents\u2019 wisdom. I\u2019ve been called father or grandfather by strangers in Asia, as a show of respect. In some countries, younger people take the elder\u2019s hand and put it to their forehead - a symbolic gesture to acknowledge and indicate a desire to absorb the elder\u2019s wisdom. These are beautiful traditions that always feel wonderful to me. Namaste! ",

            "answer_text": "Wisdom comes primarily from our experience of life and relationships. Variety and breadth of experience matters less than actual involvement with people and situations over a significant period of time. Certainly some diversity of experience is important but passing through events like a 'sightseer' is of minimal value. It is as we involve ourselves in the messiness of life and its problems, including working with people and responding to them, that wisdom grows. This aspect of life is difficult and we have to learn to handle our own emotional responses so that, at the very least, we do not alienate others. As we involve ourselves with people and situations we are certain to make mistakes. Wisdom grows as we learn to be honest with ourselves and to reflect on how we can learn from failure so as to improve our practice or behaviour for the future. To a large degree this is a matter of growth in self-understanding, not just in a psychological sense but in terms of our strengths and weaknesses. Sometimes we need to do what we cannot currently do and self-knowledge can help us to make the necessary adjustments. Wisdom is related to knowledge, particularly in an area where we need some expertise. On a traditional view of wisdom, living a good life and flourishing as a human being is what we need to become expert in doing. In the modern world, specialist knowledge is needed for many employment situations. To begin with we have to learn the first principles which may not come easily, but through perseverance the knowledge we have gained forms into patterns in our mind, even if we are not entirely aware of that happening. This is the way that knowledge becomes part of us and as it does so we find the wisdom to think creatively in our area of expertise. To gain wisdom we have to be in it for the long haul. If that comes across as hard, all we need in practice is wisdom for tomorrow's problems. Most people have the wisdom they need for the stage of life they are in and if they do not have it there are usually people around who they can ask for advice. One traditional aspect of wisdom concerns the purpose or meaning of life and it is at least questionable whether we can become truly wise without reflecting on such matters, including life's spiritual meaning. According to the Bible, knowing the Creator God is central to wisdom because the qualities that we need in order to flourish are perfectly combined in God. According to the Bible, when we root our lives in God we grow in the quality of life that he represents, including in a wisdom which is essentially a matter of love. ",

            "answer_text": "First I like to explain that there is a difference between knowledge and wisdom. By gaining enough knowledge, one can express and benefit from the conventional wisdom. The conventional wisdom is how things were done historically and how do you apply it to your current situation. Conventional wisdom allows the person to make adjustments based upon previous knowledge. And in a nutshell, that's the difference between gaining knowledge and having wisdom. So how do you gain knowledge to gain wisdom. The more you read and the more eclectic your reading is, at some point you will reach a critical mass of learning. This critical mass is the knowledge of the ages speaking through you as one. That's when the epiphany has occurred. Will this epiphany happen for everyone? And the answer is no! You can read every book that Einstein read and not be able to arrive at the prophetic conclusions that he arrived at. But even if you're stuck at the conventional wisdom level, you will be at a level few people ever arrive at. So read on and learn on! You'll be pleasantly surprised by the ride that you're on. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something.\u201d - Plato  Wise men and women always have one thing in common: They know what really matters. A Fool will worry endlessly over something that barely has any impact. They worry about how they are perceived in a single moment, worry about things they can solve in a single day, and blame themselves for things that are long gone. Someone who has gained Wisdom, on the other hand, always has as connection to the bigger goal. They don\u2019t worry about how they are perceived by people that do not matter to them, don\u2019t even consider problems that they can instantly solve, and never blame themselves for things they cannot change. Wise Men and Women always have a connection to what really matters to them; which is exactly how you gain wisdom.  To gain more wisdom remind yourself of what really matters at all times. It\u2019s not the pain in your muscles that matters but the exercise, health benefits and the muscle growth. It\u2019s not the perceptions of other people that\u2019s important but how you perceive and love yourself. It\u2019s not about the money you make, but about the happiness you gain. Once you stop putting value in the wrong things you won\u2019t be able to help becoming wiser. \u201cI believe that all wisdom consists in caring immensely for a few right things, and not caring a straw about the rest.\u201d - John Buchan Care about the things that really matter and put action behind each and every one of them.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve distilled the most meaningful living of life to this: The meaning of life is - To Learn. Understanding morality is no kind of social & psychological construct is crucial. It is an outgrowth of our biological capacity for empathy. Out of which Love also emerges that we exercise, because we are also intrinsically social creatures. Everything important in the most practical terms, attempting to express itself in sublime ways is mostly composed of Love - Integrity, dedication, authentic sincerity, honesty (especially with oneself), courage, honour etc. & must be a component of everything done or its worthless. This is why emotional intelligence & empathy are just a form of this & the inevitable reason why it is the best predictor of all levels of the most profound happiness, fulfillment, success & prosperity in life. All happiness results from living your life from the inside/out. All misery comes from doing so mostly from the outside/in. This means you need to figure out who you are or nothing can ever truly make sense. Introspection & self awareness are therefore nonnegotiable. There are neural pathways embedded in your unconscious composed of negative emotions. The good news is they can be rewritten. Consider it a sign to attend to the core principle underlying all Psychological heath - paying attention to your emotions as they come up & positively dealing with them. Doing so can resolve virtually all issues but it is very much like building a pyramid, building the strong base on which to build a life sometimes goes up slowly - but soon enough it goes up very quickly indeed. Then you will always know that you are never part of the problem of all the ugliness in life and are instead part of the solution. Finally use all your creativity & passion to look for the beauty in everything you encounter & all you meet. The crowning glory of the human intellect (that makes us either better and/or worse than all other life forms) - the imagination, must be respected. Use it to see the beauty in all things you wish to accomplish. In any way that makes sense to you. We all have a store of genius, composed of creativity & intuition. Figure out how to increase yours in this way & the universe begins to bend to your will. It\u2019s not just that nothing is more practical, but that anything else is as deeply impractical as it gets. Used properly to achieve any greater good. In applied terms known as creativity. Then be aware the most powerful operating principle of life is: What you focus on expands & that what you then attract & magnetize will be as a result to the degree you never hold onto a negative feeling/thought & focus on the foregoing. It's a kind of law of physics the unconscious is neverendingly relentless about enforcing. You deal with it or it deals with you. It\u2019s always a choice. There is a something however to make this all work better & faster. Realizing that thinking about the future is often an excuse to worry & obsessing about the past only amplifies regret. Staying in the right now empowers all of the above unspeakably. It keeps your subconscious anxieties from interfering & being self sabotaging, allowing you to access your personal power as described above. That\u2019s the core truth all the talk of mindfulness is about. ",

            "answer_text": "I like to preface my response to the thrust of your question with this elegant quote from well-known American industrialist Henry Ford: \"Thinking is hard work, and that is why very few people engage in it.\" Thinking new ideas often will give us a new and broad perspective to look at the ever abundant data around us in order for us to gather valuable information for planning and decision making.  Always remember this, ideas must come first. Thomas Edison, the famous inventor, once remarked: \"Make it a practice to keep on the lookout for novel and interesting ideas that others have used successfully.  Your idea has to be original only in its adaptation to the problems you are working.\" Robert Kiyosaski, author of \u2018If You Want to Be Rich & Happy Don't Go to School: Ensuring Lifetime Security for Yourself and Your Children\u2019, gave this simple advice to all those who wants to be rich: \"It's what in your head that determines what is in your hands.  Money is only an idea.  If you want more money, simply change your thinking.  Money never starts an idea.  It is the idea that starts the money.\" With almost all data and information are available at our fingertips, we should seriously focus on generating ideas and provoking insights. By doing so, then we are in a better - also, faster and even smarter - position to make effective use of the constant bombardment of environmental data in order to produce valuable information, through our conceptual understanding and personal relevancy. And by seeing the pattern of relationships in the abundant information we produced, or \"connecting the dots\", as Steve Jobs so eloquently put it a decade ago, we get better ideas and insights. Putting our viable ideas and insights to work in our life, in our work, in our business, and/or even for our client(s), gives us the opportunity to know what works, what doesn't work and what could possibly work better, faster and smarter the next time around, with a little bit of tweaking on our part or acquisition of additional strategies and tactics. The gainful result is experience. Cumulative experience = knowledge, in the practical sense. As Albert Einstein is believed to have said: \"Knowledge is experience; everything else is just information.\" Over time, with continual application and consistent evolution, our cumulative knowledge becomes expertise. Again, with ongoing adaptation, and continuous and never ending improvement in whatever we think and do, our discerning use of expertise eventually becomes wisdom. That's how I see the trajectory: DATA --> INFORMATION --> IDEAS ---> EXPERIENCE ---> KNOWLEDGE ---> EXPERTISE ---> WISDOM ",

Also there isn\u2019t an end point to exploring the wisdom we can gain in so far as I have found. Some of us are born with a natural nak for being observant. This doesn\u2019t necessarily equal wiseness but it\u2019s a head start on others. To be wise we must be observant. Either naturally or consciously working to be. Notice the nuances of every day life. Absorb, admire or dismiss them. Use our observations and adjust them within ourself. Make mistakes and learn from them. Take responsibility. Learn from consequences. We behave badly and loose a friend. Hurt someone and loose their respect. Put someone in an uncomfortable position, they loose trust in us. Do a poor job at work, loose the job. Make choices which create variety of outcomes\u2026All these types of things can make us wiser. But only if we take responsibility for our part in them. Contribute if necessary but not focus and blame outside factors. Blame and playIng a victim (oh poor me, why me) never gains someone wisdom. We own a whole or at least a part of everything which happens in our life. Find it. Listen to people more than talk. Everything people say can give us insight. Note mistakes people make and learn from those too.I believe a good amount of wisdom comes from listening to the most mistake ridden people around. Even those who are unable to change their behavior after the same mistakes. They paint a reality of what doesn\u2019t strengthen us. People can be a mirror for our qualities, favorable or not. Be patient to gain wisdom. We are born with endless capacity to gain wisdom but not born wise. Being wise is progressive. It is gained over experiences. The more experiences we have paired with reflection on our part in those experiences advances our wisdom. Im not so sure wiseness can be taught, like a class. It is more like something which we naturally grow into. Some people I\u2019ve come across seem too distracted by what\u2019s going on in their head to ever grow into wisdom. This is where mindfulness comes in the most handy. Otherwise some never learn how to let go and capture the present while taking into account the past as a guide and tool into the future. Instead they see the past only as a set back, an excuse rather than the gift it is. By this they are stuck on the past unable to be in the present, and worry over the future. Letting go of yesterday yet bringing the lessons of it with us is a key for gaining wisdom. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Learn to separate your inner child from your logical mind Most people find this incredibly difficult at first, and laughably easy after some practice. Inner wisdom is something most children have. The logical mind is something most adults have. Inner wisdom is something that many logical adults squash in their young children, never knowing how important it is, and then those same children go on to become logical adults who squash their kids\u2019 inner wisdom. It\u2019s coming close to an epidemic in our part of the world. In order for us to reconnect with our inner guidance, we need to reconnect with our inner child. More often than not, our inner wisdom speaks to us by way of desire. Just like a bee is led to a flower by desire, so we are always being led towards our needs by deep, gut feelings. Children follow this kind of guidance without thinking twice. Their reasoning for doing things is \u201cbecause it feels good,\u201d \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t feel right,\u201d and other completely irrational reasons that make logical adults\u2019 heads swim. Our logical mind guides us by way of analysis. Its optimal functioning is to find the most efficient ways to fulfill our needs. A mind that is united with the inner wisdom will become more and more efficient at fulfilling our deepest, most authentic desires. Without such guidance, however, the mind must find some other desires to fulfill, such as the desires of our parents, our peer groups, and, too often, the highest paying advertisers. The art of separating your inner child from your logical adult mind, then, is the art of separating your authentic desires from your conditioned ones. It is the fine art of knowing the difference between what you really, truly want and what you\u2019ve been trained to want. 2. Make mental personalities for both On this journey, you will need to shift authority from your logical mind to your inner child. After some time, they will learn to work together, but at first, there will be a power struggle. The easiest way to know whom you\u2019re speaking to is to give a real, human personality to both of them. When your mind begins to brew up anxiety and drawn out \u201cWhat if\u2026?!\u201d stories, you\u2019ll take it much less seriously if you imagine those words coming from an overworked and unappreciated office worker who hates her job and hasn\u2019t slept properly in days. Likewise, when your inner guidance speaks to you in a soft whisper, you\u2019ll follow it more faithfully if you imagine that you\u2019re being beckoned by a wise 100-year-old man under a cherry blossom tree who speaks to you in riddles and never raises his voice. Even better, find real people in your life who represent these two factions within you. Your relationship to your logical mind \u2013 the pattern of you submitting to reason-based authority \u2013 might be perfectly reflected in your relationship with your boss, parent, or spouse. Likewise, your relationship to your inner guidance \u2013 the pattern of you ignoring its \u201cchildish\u201d or \u201cirrational\u201d ideas \u2013 might be perfectly reflected in your relationship with your child, sibling, or grandparent. When you hear either voice speak to you, see its personality in your head. It will make it much easier for you to decide whom to trust. 3. Listen when your inner child speaks, don\u2019t talk over it Imagine ignoring a person for 10, 20, 30 years and, then, when you need their help, showing up to their doorstep asking for favors. The chances of them jumping up enthusiastically are slim to none. If you have not been hearing your wise inner child, this is because you\u2019ve ignored it for too long. You\u2019ve instilled silence into a relationship that\u2019s meant to be a lifetime conversation. It will take time to rebuild that trust. The good news is \u2013 your relationship with your inner child is never irreparably damaged. No matter how long it takes, your intuition will return to you. All you have to do is listen, with patience and presence, every time it speaks and not just when you need it to. Again, imagine your inner child as having a real, human personality. Each time you listen to that inner voice, acknowledge it, respect it, and do what it says, you will strengthen your relationship with it. Its voice will become louder with each conversation.  4. Realize that reprogramming your mind will take time, mistakes, and self-forgiveness When I began this journey, I would imagine my logical mind as a tiger \u2013 wild, powerful, and ferocious. Taming it, I got bloodied up many times. Reprogramming a lifetime of conditioning is difficult. It\u2019s even more difficult to get your logic-loving brain to accept the notions of faith, love, and happiness. It will take time, no matter how hard you try. You will make mistakes. You will falter. Since there\u2019s no way to avoid mistakes, you may as well learn to laugh at them. I can honestly say that learning the fine art of not taking myself so seriously has made more of a difference than anything else. No matter how long it takes or how many mistakes I make, I am doing my best, and that is enough.  5. Make self-discovery into a necessity You know that adage that tells you to accept the things you can\u2019t change and change the ones you can? Well, the fact that self-discovery is essential for healing and happiness is something you can never change. No matter where in the world you go or what new people you\u2019re around, you will always need to be your own best friend in order for your happiness to be sustainable. So, commit to that. Commit to discovering yourself and rekindling your relationship with your inner child with awed curiosity and ceaseless passion. You already commit to eating and sleeping each day, because you know you need those things to live. Accept your self-discovery as a basic need too. Make it a lifetime commitment. Go to the mirror, look in those striking eyes of yours, and say, \u201cI promise to do my best to understand you, care for you, and listen to you, for as long as you shall live.\u201d And I promise you that, if you explore yourself with the same curiosity as you would explore a new lover, you will not only find your sense of inner guidance, you\u2019ll also find a deep happiness that is unshakable by chaos, criticism, or circumstance.

            "answer_text": "For me, there are wisdom and life lessons that are relevant to each of us, to our own uniqueness. The wisdom of acceptance and relinquishing control is the most important for me personally. I learned it when I was 31 years old. All my life, I have been struggling and found myself as a \u201ctrying hard\". Although I've accomplished above average feats compared to my peers in academics and in my career, I found myself struggling to find my big break. I'm very passionate and lacked patience, and I found myself wanting to do more, be recognized more, and be compensated more. The usual stuff. Until one day, I met someone who've taught me the lesson about control. I fell in love with this person. He was manipulative and played games at me. My flaw of \u201cwanting more\u201d and \u201cwanting to control\u201d (the person) has never been amplified that much in my life. Until such a time that I can no longer sleep and felt physical pain in my heart. In the peak of \u201cwanting\u201d I had to let go. It took me 1\u20133 years before completely moving on. When I was recovering, I've read and read a bunch of stuff related to my pain. I wanted to feel better. I was not a religious person but I've memorized prayers to calm myself down. I've consulted two friends regarding the experience both of whom shared similar experiences but diffent views which I appreciated. I've read self-help online articles and discovered different perspectives in living life, about aspiring without struggle, of accepting myself and circumstances while improving those that I can. This wisdom of acceptance has resonated greatly to my stuggles in life and I have applied it to every single aspect in my life, in my career, in my relationships, in everything. I have so much gratitude to this person who has caused me immense pain but had opened the gate to this wisdom. Thank you. What is the wisdom for your own being? How would you learn it? Mine is the wisdom of acceptance and I've learned it through pain. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the question, David. I was interested in sharing from the \u201cBook of Wisdom,\u201d (which I became very intrigued by) as it may not be familiar to people who don\u2019t consider it part of the Bible (like Catholics and Orthodox do). As for \u201cHow do I get wisdom?\u201dyou have asked for something that is in short supply! What our culture admires most is knowledge. There is no shortage of ways to attain that: study, read, take classes, practice what you are good at, take advantage of every opportunity. Show everyone what you can do, Have a great deal of \u201cself-esteem.\u201dOne can have knowledge of many things at a very young age, but\u2026 \u201cWisdom?\u201d That requires: becoming humble, listening to others, learning from terrible mistakes, and paying more attention to others than oneself. There is also a mysterious form of wisdom in small children. When he had just learned a few words, our toddler son interrupted anxious dinner talk about illness one night and said, \u201cNeed to pray! Trials go on and on. Need to pray!\u201dIf not for things like that, I would say one acquires wisdom by living long. Yet some never acquire it, and some can display it before they can walk\u2026 If you discover all it\u2019s secrets, please let me know! ",

            "answer_text": "Look for it. Where is it? What is it? \u201cIt\u201d will ring true for you; it will grab you by your brain stem, and you will happily acknowledge it. This experience is subtle, but important and worth the effort, which, btw, is onerous, I\u2019ll admit. I couldn\u2019t find it inside me on my own; I was too frantic, looking everywhere at once, picking up one thing only to soon drop it and pick up something else. I had to have many philosophy and psychological teachers guide me over many years: Plato, Aristotle, Kant, pretty much in that order. Other philosophers are interesting, but they seem off-base to me or fail to deliver the goods, if you will, guys like Aquinas, Descartes, Berkeley, Leibniz, Hume, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Derrida. You can waste many precious hours and days on their philosophies and come out pretty much empty-handed, although Nietzsche will challenge and often delight you. The one and only philosopher that seems, to me, to offer a complete, satisfying package is Benedict de Spinoza (1632-77), pictured above. His \u201cEthics\u201d is a gift from heaven, but it\u2019s difficult to unpack; it will probably take years and the aid of many interpreters, such as Beth Lord, H.A. Wolfson, and Stuart Hampshire. Maybe some thinkers can quickly and easily grasp Spinozism. I\u2019m not one of them \u2014 too impatient to stop and ponder his thoughts. The calmer I get, though, the better I can see the wisdom, sitting there in plain sight, but often overlooked for many reasons: its intrinsic difficulty; its so-called atheism; its different viewpoint with its redefinitions of many emotions, for example, in unfamiliar ways. If your current weltanschauung were correct, you could stick with it, right? If it ain\u2019t working for you, though, may I suggest Spinozism? Even so, I\u2019ll grant that there may be many ways to find wisdom; this path, Spinozism, though, seems one that works for me. Maybe I\u2019m just desperate; the hour is getting late, in fact, very late. ",

            "answer_text": "You cannot actually gain wisdom from outside yourself, you can only get knowledge (information). Wisdom develops as a product of how one \"digests\" knowledge within consciousness. Wisdom forms from the resulting thought provided by the proverbial \"food for thought\". A teacher can teach knowledge of wisdom but it is the student that must understand by synthesizing (digesting) the knowledge to make it one's own. Little bits of wisdom can be structured from little bits of knowledge of nature. But then, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. We can see where real wisdom is missing in the so-called \"genius\" of those who make clever use of knowledge of certain laws of nature to harm others. Not so wise, such people ignore the law of action and reaction. Great wisdom is a holistic understanding, encompassing one's whole being\u2014all of natural law\u2014not partial knowledge that leaves something out.  When you can think with your heart and feel with your mind, then you have integration, an essential prerequisite for living the highest wisdom. Then the sense made of the world naturally comes out as wisdom. Otherwise, it's all just raw data. To integrate heart and mind requires the attention to repeatedly go beyond thinking, to the level of unification of knower, process of knowing, and the object of knowledge, where those three distinctions are found to fundamentally be just one\u2014pure existence without a second\u2014knowingness knowing itself. That is the foundational level of existence where all laws of nature are unified. Having established that, then experiencing every level of natural law, from unity all the way into the most diversified values becomes significant. THAT is the highest knowledge, that is to be known. Knowing that, everything else falls into proper perspective and daily life is approached with wisdom. It is absolutely life changing in every way. The best way to go beyond thought AND develop integration is the technique of Transcendental Meditation (aka TM) as taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Learn about the Transcendental Meditation technique. This creates the basis\u2014the fertile soil, as it were\u2014where wisdom can develop. To see how TM creates brainwave integration, view the video by internationally renowned researcher on meditation Dr. Fred Travis: Are All Meditations the Same? Gives a whole new meaning to the colloquial expression \"getting your head together.\" ",

Then there are other types of knowing, knowing how, how to do something like riding a bicycle, drive a car, swim, do the things that gymnasts, pianists, swimmers, biologists, geologists, visual artists, novelists, philosophers, mathematicians, pilots, etc do.You can read all about riding a bicycle, driving a car, flying a plane, doing gymnastics or swimming, shooting a gun - but that is no guarantee that you will be able to execute that activity or execute it well or as a professional.These skills and abilities knowing how to do or execute something must be learned and mastered.You will acquire all sorts of experience by doing these things and understanding of many things because and through this experience.In the same way scientific knowledge and understanding in biology, or physics, nuclear or astrophysics, chemistry, theology, zoology, mathematics, IT, etc and applications of knowledge from the disciplines, will enable you to understand many things in those specialized disciplines, but understanding and having knowledge of things and information in one scientific discipline is no guarantee that you will understand another discipline.So do you think that no individual prior to the development of sciences a few hundred years ago had any degree of wisdom? Or Asian, Far Eastern, Buddhist, Sufi and other sages had no wisdom as they did not study or know western sciences?There are different types of wisdom and in each of them one realizes always greater degrees of wisdom. There are many ways to measure and study wisdom and research places that are occupied with these studies. One of them is the Wisdom Institute at Chicago University. They have a vast list of resources on their site concerning these things.

            "answer_text": "This is more than a good question, it is THE question.There\u2019s no single path to wisdom, but it can be worth understanding how others obtained it. May I suggest reading about Gautama Siddarth\u2019s life, and how his seeking of truth changed him. It\u2019s impossible to follow the same path because the world has changed immensely in 2500 years, and that same path no longer exists. The method remains available to all of us. From birth, our bodies and minds accumulate very effectively. The accumulations of the mind are the things we are taught, and the things that we learn on our own. In the modern world we are taught quite intensely for 18 to 25 years. That\u2019s an vast amount of other people\u2019s information implanted in our minds, and it\u2019s a necessary reality for survival and prosperity in the modern world. We rarely have time to question it after that time either, because we live busy lives making homes and families, and working to support and nurture them. However, our minds are not authentically ours until we take the time to examine what we have accumulated, and make conscious decisions about whether we know it to be true through direct experience of it. One very effective way to do this is to live in a culture that is as different as possible to the one that you have accumulated. I don\u2019t mean visit one, I really do mean live it, especially one in which your native language is not their language. At first you will make comparisons and judgements, piece by piece, but after some time you will begin to appreciate the whole, and how it fits together. Even your mundane daily routines of keeping house, personal hygiene, food, and social interactions will be questioned (by you), dismantled, and re-assembled - not necessarily to match the new culture - but as your own authentic set of ways to do these things, after contemplation, experimentation, direct experience, and purposeful formation of habits. You may choose to eliminate some habits that were not serving you well (maybe smoking), and in the process, will learn some important realities about yourself and the concept of free will. These things may seem trivial, but they are not. They are foundational. Every other thing in your life is built upon your daily essential routines. If the foundation can be purposely re-built, then so can everything else in your mind. You should start to see everything that you encounter differently - see it the way it is, instead of the way you were taught that it is. Your thoughts will become less judgmental, and more open to observing and understanding what is really there. Throughout history people have gone alone into the wilderness to live in nature, and this has taken them a further step (or major leap) in their wisdom. This is a practical impossibility in many parts of the world now (this fact alone speaks volumes about the state of the world), and it is not for everyone, but this is the ultimate \u201cother culture\u201d. The local culture of creatures & plants, adapted to the weather, seasons and terrain will further dismantle and rebuild your mind\u2019s accumulations. The culture of nature is free from human concepts, but it is complex, and nature will not explain it to you - one discovers and realizes it by becoming a harmonious part of it. On an everyday basis you can dismantle and rebuild your mind\u2019s accumulations in many ways. Ideally, confront your personal boundaries and taboos. Are they really yours or were they given to you by parents, teachers and culture? If you haven\u2019t tested them, you don\u2019t know. The foundational ones are gender, sexuality, status, dominance and submission. How often do you use the word \u201cbelieve\u201d? We never use that word when we really know. What we mean is \u201cI have a theory\u201d. If you often use the phrase \u201cI believe\u201d, then you have lots of theories, lots of other people\u2019s ideas, but you don\u2019t really know very much yet. A wise person doesn\u2019t know everything (knowledge of everything is beyond our capacity), but a wise person is honest and open about what they don\u2019t know, and doesn\u2019t attempt to present theory as fact - even in their own mind\u2019s thoughts. Gautama embodied this idea of wisdom. His dharma (his teaching) contains no theories or philosophy. He very purposely taught only things that can be tested and proven personally by anyone, and used in daily life to improve it. His reasoning was that the moment he introduces a need to believe in something that can\u2019t be proven, then the whole body of work loses its value. You won\u2019t hear a wise person say \u201cBelieve me\u201d. Instead you should hear \u201cDon\u2019t believe me. Prove it to yourself\u201d, because the wise know that giving someone more accumulated knowledge is just making another clone. Encouraging people to evolve into unique authentic beings is a wise thing to do. ",

True wisdom is natural and is with you 100% of the time.  Now, what is ignorance? It is tricky, but I would say the thought-feeling of \"not enough\". Not enough fun, not enough pleasure, not enough friendship, not enough love, not enough wisdom, not enough happiness, not enough knowledge, not enough masters. Not enough of yourself. And it is a mental movement, nothing more.  Once you see that thoughts are only that - thoughts - you have unlimited access to wisdom. You see things for what they are, and you stop trying to answer questions. Because questions always arise out of the belief in this mental movement, better said, that this mental movement can bring you truth. So you don't answer the question, you question the question. And then there it is. Just an insignificant fleeing thought. Everything absolutely clear. No mystery, no fancy thing, no atom-splitting. ",

As someone who has considered myself to have become both (at least partially), and never really reflected on it I\u2019ll try to speak about my own experience. I do think you\u2019re largely born with intelligence. But everyone has room for improvement. Intelligence is problem solving. Intelligence is thinking outside the box. Intelligence is, when you come across something you don\u2019t understand, exploring it with your mind as opposed to saying \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d and shutting down (which is what I used to do). Intelligence is recognising that evil is relative. Accepting people\u2019s lives who\u2019re total opposites to yourself. Standing back from a situation and evaluating it. Intelligence is questioning everything. Nothing in life is simple. Question everything and then try to answer your own questions. \u201cWhy am I being told this? Is this influencing me in a specific way? It didn\u2019t work the first time, what else can I do? Am I switched on? What is the most efficient way to pack this suitcase?\u201d Most of all, intelligence is your brain. How much you can think about things. It\u2019s not mindlessly reading through a book to memorise everything, it\u2019s thinking \u201cWhat are the key points here? How can I remind myself of these if I need to? What should I do to take a break so I can come back refreshed?\u201d Wisdom is also relative. And more complex. Wisdom comes from life experience. Wisdom is learning the answers to the questions you ask. Wisdom is learning. Wisdom is realising every situation has a lesson to be learned. Wisdom is searching within yourself for your demons holding you back. Noticing how to approach other people. It\u2019s realising that your brain shuts down when you don\u2019t understand something instead of working it out. Your intelligence is your brain and your wisdom is your spirit. To become more of either is knowing what they are, and switching your internal thought processes to align with both. ",

            "answer_text": "Wisdom is obtained through daily life experience and observation.There is no way to teach this wisdom,so you have to get it on your own. Mere daily life experience won\u2019t help if you don\u2019t make a conclusion out of it. And for that you must be willing to learn from every situation. Remember that \u201cwhen the student is ready , the teacher appears.\u201d Let me give you an example. You and one another guy are best friends.. you never keep any secret between you two. Suddenly a girl comes into his life and he started drifting away from you. And he even started sharing the secrets that you acknowledged him with. After that you never tell anyone about your secrets . What did you get to learn from it.. ? Never trust anyone blindly . Now , what if you do not wish to learn anything from it i.e.. you just say it to yourself that, that guy was a moron but not this one (yes ..you picked up another one). And then the history repeated itself. This time maybe not because of girl but due to any other reason. What will happen? Your self efficacy woul be crushed for no reason.Your privacy is destroyed as the secret which you revealed to only one person is now the grapevine trending across the corridors of your college (say).This cycle will be repeated and you will be cheated again and again unless you learn the lesson.Now there are many lessons which you can learn from any particular incident (don\u2019t catagorise it to be bad or good). The lessons you learn purely depends on your perspective of seeing it. So if you broaden your perspective , this will help you as you can gain multiple lessons from a single incident/event. Cheers !!

When I go through my own trials, I take time to reflect on what it taught me. I usually do this by writing in a journal or sharing my experience with someone I trust. I also do the best I can to be open minded and remember that I am young and not all-knowing. I still have much to learn.

            "answer_text": "I second Carol Unter's answer: pay attention; and I'll add, examine details. You're doing that to find patterns. Patterns allow otherwise incomparable things to be compared.  Also, never take anything for granted. This applies especially to the \"learning from wise people\" category:  if you don't know why they say or do what they say or do, then you haven't achieved their wisdom, and you may not even understand it. Also, some of them are actually not wise at all, or their wisdom was context-relative and has expired. Check everything, trust no one (not even me). Finally, do not hold out for hard conclusions, sometimes they're just not available. Sometimes, it is sufficient (for the moment) to be able to say X is not yet known, but it is definitely not going to be A, B, Z or N. Keep collecting information: waiting for it to show up is one way of doing that, taking actions and observing results is another (induction). Wisdom doesn't lie in having answers for everything, it lies in having enough answers to proceed with. Process matters. ",

I didn\u2019t want it so that I could show off my knowledge, I wanted it so I could live a good life and make compassionate and informed choices. I didn\u2019t want to make mistakes; certainly if I was wise, I\u2019d be smart too. At some point, I dropped my search for wisdom. There were no maps to guide my way, but there were breadcrumbs of consciousness that led me down an invisible road to higher understanding. There\u2019s a story about Socrates. He sets out to find the wisest person alive. He interviews poets, politicians, and commoners. Many claim to be wise, but when Socrates interviews them, he finds they have an inflated views of themselves and they were filled with self-importance. Socrates himself, claimed nothing. He didn\u2019t see himself as wise, but he was proclaimed the wisest man of his times. If one of the wisest men alive was not aware of his wisdom, it may be that if you gain wisdom you will be unaware of it. There are no wisdom lessons. Once we start quantifying our wisdom quotients, we lose our wisdom. How does one gain wisdom? If we are to learn from Socrates, we will not seek wisdom itself and that might be the wisest thing we can ever do. ",

            "answer_text": "In the absence of knowledge, one cannot have wisdom! What we call knowledge is collection of information which is generally known as Data. But data or information is never called \u2018knowledge\u2019 till the one who has the data understands where and how the information in the data can be utilized to gain benefits out of it. In other words it is the realization of the useability of the data that makes it Knowledge and a person do so is called knowledgeable. Wisdom is our ability to understand the consequences when knowledge is applied under different conditions and situations. It also tells us when, where or whether to apply the knowledge at all! A wise ruler does not use the power of nuclear energy to destroy, but uses it protect life. Knowledge does not know what is good or bad; right or wrong; appropriate or inappropriate. Nor is it concerned with these. It is only the person who has knowledge considers all these and therefore knows. Wisdom therefore is one\u2019s ability to segregate (discriminate) and decide actions. It is called \u201cViveka\u201d and comes from Bhuddhi or intelligence. It is achieved through constant churning of knowledge in our mind. Churning is called \u2018manan\u2019 (out of which the expression mind came) and it is the vital faculty of mind. Wisdom comes out of Mindfulness. Mindfulness is \u2018living in the present\u2019 without getting caught in the painful past events or worrying about the future because these habits make our mind polluted, biased and restrain us to see the true nature of things. On the other hand if we focus on what is happening in \u201cthe present\u201d we have an unbiased mind that gives us clear directions as to how, when or whether we should act. It is said that Einstein\u2019s toddler son asked him whether he could jump from the first floor to his living room below. Einstein who was in deep thought said, \u201cYes.\u201d The boy broke his leg! Wisdom is abundance of commonsense propelled by Mindfulness. Mindfulness makes us realize the importance of Values in life and help us to develop a positive \u2018belief system.\u2019 It is out of mindfulness we draw our ability to be empathetic, compassionate, caring and considerate. Mindfulness gives us the sense of being just and encourages us to be impartial. It makes us aware of the importance of first evaluating things and situations before acting. What we call Emotional Intelligence percolates out of Mindfulness. Mindfulness makes us \u2018respond\u2019 and not \u2018react\u2019 to situations. It makes our conversation desirous and communication effective. It is because of these very reasons, Mindfulness is has been embraced by Lord Buddha and made it the centre pillar of Buddhism. The most important aspect of Mediation is to get our wandering mind to the present and for that the practitioners learn to focus on the breathing first. Mindfulness de-clutters our mind and makes it \u2018responsible!\u201d  Affectionately ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by true wisdom. For me is the wisdom of the ancient philosophers, who understood we are the only responsible for creating our own reality. Fully responsible. The bottom line of that philosophy is that we aren\u2019t who we think we are, we are much much more than that. The power of such a wisdom is that it can be used very practically to create the life you love. The core premise of the philosophy is that \u201cyour focus creates your reality\u201d, in other words you can create literally anything, if you can keep your focus on it. Issue is, there\u2019s an unconscious part of you -the Ego- which has a very different agenda, and unless aware of it, Ego always wins, as your focus is unconsciously on something else. In specific, if unaware of all the above, you live your entire life trying to compensate what you perceive you lack of. It may be worth, or significance, or power, or love, and so on. So, how can you acquire that true wisdom, in order to live a life with purpose, and eventually funding your fulfilment and happiness? 3 things: 1- read about it. The path of least resistance, The magician\u2019s way, for example, are great in that sense. 2- get awareness about your Ego. Any time your life or an area of your life is stuck or not flowing, ask yourself what\u2019s underneath. In other words where your focus really is: are you focused on your end result, or where? 3- choose to create what you really love. Not what you rationally want, but you truly love. In that sense, the path of least resistance is a great book to learn from. Only when you know how and why you are holding yourself back, and you know what you truly love, you have true wisdom, and you can make a free choice. ",

Let me burst your brain: Benjamin Franklin says \"The doorstep to the temple of wisdom is a knowledge of our own ignorance\". Meaning that you have to acknowledge that you are unwise before you become wise. Wisdom is essential in life. Life is too risky to live without wisdom and Jim Rohn said that the amazing thing about the risky nature of life is that you can't get out of it. Get wisdom. James 1:8, ask for wisdom. If you don't know how to ask for wisdom, the video in the comment below is there to help. The video is a true story of the power of wisdom and what wisdom can do for you. #Wisdom #Grow ",

It is from the state of awareness to that collection of the place where our belonging was voluntarily shifted to learn how and what living offers us in the absence of a time without end. Wisdom is caught in the still between moments. By allowing yourself to understand who we are in everything, and everyone, the ability we share increases to empathically feel an allegorical joining within the unity of the wisdom in a benevolent action. Wisdom is something everyone has access to through learning. Some it just takes longer to remember what they are here to learn. The wisdom of words is often shared through silence. Those of wisdom know when and when not to speak. ",

(once the Nephesh leaves the body the body die.) ",

To have wisdom in your fingertips, that you could use to shake entire earth?!    If so, then here's a little secret.   There's no limit to your Wisdom!   the thing is that you get wiser and wiser every single day, unless you choose  to degrade. There's always a choice.     When was the last time you made a mistake? when was the last time you've seen   somebody else make a mistake? Making mistakes provides learning experience  and so you become a little bit wiser by acknowledging and learning from them. The Question is: How Wise do you want to be?  do you want to be wise as philosophers are?    study them.    Their habits. Their thinking and implement that.    Do you want to just be great at decision making so you could ace through life and   make the best decisions ever? Well, that requires wisdom but it's awesome how   simple is to get good at it.    Simple, but not easy. In this case you can study logical fallacies, cognitive biases.   Have fun, xo xo. ;-) ",

Many philosophers and great scholars have gained wisdom by practising it daily. One of the great examples of gaining wisdom is of Benjamin Franklin (Founding Father Of The United States). He had kept a daily journal where he is used to note down all the things that he had done during the whole day. He used to pen down all the good deeds and bad deeds done by him. By doing this daily one will have a clear vision of oneself and will be able to know one\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and will be able to excel in his professional as well as his personal life, as one will know oneself and will know how to handle each situation tactfully. Wisdom can just not be gained by a mere thought of gaining it. There should be strong desire for it. Also, one can read books and quotes of philosophers and saints like Sri Ramana Maharshi, Robert Adams, Bhagavan Nithyananda and famous sufi saints like Hazrat Inayat Khan. But, the best book you can read is of knowing oneself. As, one of most famous greek philosphers has quoted : \u201cKnow Thyself\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The wisest man to ever live on Earth recorded the process for its commencement: The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight. (Proverbs 9:10) The psalmist expressed further information about the fear of the Lord poetically in the thirty-fourth Psalm (11-19): Come, O children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord. What man is there who desires life and loves many days, that he may see good? Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit. Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous and his ears toward their cry. The face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth. When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears and delivers them out of all their troubles. The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit. Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all. So, to gain wisdom, it behoves us to realise that God, our Creator, is in charge of everything we have. We need to defer to Him in everything we think, say, decide and do. We have to realise that by default, we are subject to the forces of evil, and we have to actively turn away from them, and choose to follow God and His Goodness. We have to realise that He has, in His mercy and because of His great love, redeemed us from our predicament. We need to humble ourselves before Him and receive His help and comfort to live in this sinful world. ",

All the religions and moral philosophies are aimed at helping us understand and realize these deeper principles so that we can apply them in our lives. Realizer and realization are not two. In fact, the realizer becomes the realization. That is why we should continuously read, listen to, or watch creations of people with a more refined consciousness than ours. That is why the wise men of ancient India had laid down the three fold process of learning - shravanam, mananam, nidhidhyasam. Shravanam means to listen or to read; mananam is to contemplate upon what we have read or heard; and nidhidhyasam refers to the realization that awakens in us as a result of the wisdom that we have just heard or read, penetrating deep into our soul. The nidhidhyasam elevates our soul's consciousness to a new higher level of awareness which is called wisdom. We 'become' our new elevated realization. It helps us to become calmer, happier and wiser. ",

For example, y work in mathematics is primarily focused on mathematical logic and geometry (with theoretical computer science). My work in philosophy is primarily focused on logic, philosophy of logic and the philosophy of mathematics (with linguistics & philosophy of language). I am also interested in number theory, epistemology (with metaphysics) & axiology. In therms of science I\u2019m primarily interested in theoretical physics and biochemistry (with cogitative science). Furthermore, thanks to the stimulus from Islam I have also come to form an interest in religious studies (such as the philosophy of religion). Cheers! ",

One side by each party and then the truth. Because both parties will minimize their own fault in the situation. No matter the situation. Unless its a good one. Then everyone scrambles to get the most credit. Its also having a good moral compass. Being an honest man, even when its rough and the more difficult route to take. And yes, all of this is intelligence. It also means don't stop asking questions. Being open to the idea of learning something new, and being ready to fall and ready to fail, but ready and eager to try again and get it right the next time because you learned why you'd failed the first time.

I always hated that part of me and wondered why that quality isn't herited on me. I used to listen and observe my mother's actions ad tried to be just like her. She was my hero, (still is and always will be). I asked everyone who I thought smart that how can I become smart and wise like them and they give me same old answer,\"Eat Almonds in the morning and blah blah blah...\" But as I grow up I came to know that my mother wasn't always like that, time made her wise, she suffered alot, struggled alot and learned from her every mistake. And one day she told me the key, answer to my question that \u201dSamajhdari badam khane se nahi balki dhokha khane se aati hai\u201d English translation, \"Wisdom doesn't come by taking Almonds but by taking cheats\".

Find a Guru who is the fountainhead of knowledge and in his association, all your doubts will be cleared and you will be established in the pure knowledge. How to find him?

There are some people who are naturally wise, they just seem to \"get it\", but most of us have to grow into life.  There's an overused but apt saying: youth is wasted on the young. It's unfortunate that by the time most of us have developed enough wisdom to get a grip on life, we're well past the midway point. If you're under 30, go talk to some \"old\" people who appear to be well adjusted and satisfied with things. Ask them if there's anything they would tell their 20-year-old selves, and take that advice to heart. Otherwise, just live your life and pay attention to your mistakes as well as your successes so you can minimize the former and maximize the latter. ",

Their skills at developing and utilizing people were their most highly valued qualities.

I\u2019ve known a lot of old people who are so stubborn in their own way of seeing that they can\u2019t see the world beyond them.

It\u2019s evolution is accelerated as a result of thoughtful study, mediation, and the cultivation of a spirit of service and helpfulness toward all whom we meet on the path of life. Study of New Age philosophy can help because that is sourced in wisdom. ",

The story of King Salamon's famous judgement in the dispute between two mothers and a baby is a classic example.

Not long ago when I used to visit him and tell him about my writing, he always can up with an observation about some word I was using. Either is was most appropriate or a curious use of the word.

Prophets who come to us for our benefit. A contemporary of Jung and Freud who has foolishly been overlooked, is Roberto Assagioli He wrote books that have wisdom in them. He is a meditator. And he spoke of avoiding poisons. Not physical poisons as much as psychic poison. Avoid media and TV and most of todays music. He quotes an Indian saying, \u201cEverything is food\u201d\u2026 not just food! Colors, words, tones of voices, vibrations around you from other people. We should be careful about the company we keep. Most people are not seeking wisdom. Most religious types ( who I respect ) are more in the moral category than the spiritual category.

Never turn down a DIY project that could lead to a new skill. Be a cheap bastard and go on never ending quests for interesting and useful objects. Study efficiency, reason and philosophy.

Experiencing life makes you wise and that requires action. Read books, talk to people, try to love what you do, work hard towards something, etc. and many such everyday life things would make you wise. If you can learn from the people around you, you'd have more wisdom, but that's a real difficult thing. To be idle is a short road to death and to be diligent is a way of life; foolish people are idle, wise people are diligent. - Buddha ",

Philosophy is the traditional study of wisdom in the West and is also a great place to look (given that\u2019s what it aims to understand in addition to many other things).
