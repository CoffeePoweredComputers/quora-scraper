            "answer_text": "Politically incorrect humor in movies. This went from the 1970s through the early 2000s. Try making Animal House, Airplane, the Blues Brothers, any Will Farrell movie or Mel Brooks movie etc. and see what happens today. No studio would accept such a script. I think it\u2019s amusing actually because society was so strict on music (such as hip hop) but people could be crass, crude, and what many people today would call racist in films. I think those movies are hilarious. It\u2019s sad that we won\u2019t get more of them. ",
