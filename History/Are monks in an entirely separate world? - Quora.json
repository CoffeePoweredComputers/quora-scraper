            "answer_text": "In Christianity there are different kinds of orders for religious. Some are more active and involved in the world. they might work as teachers or do other work. The contemplative orders are more withdrawn from the world . They will spend more of their time in prayer and their work will be executed inside their monastic areas, The latter might be said to live in an entirely separate or more spiritual world as they are more withdrawn from everyday life, but in the end all human life wherever you are will consist of the same mental things such as attitudes, beliefs, emotions, relationships, eating, sleeping, working, etc ",

To not get involved in greed, hatred and delusion as much as possible so they can live a life of prayer and purification, whether that is Catholic or Buddhist etc. They tend to but not always live out in rural areas removed form large cities, but they are not so far removed form the world that they have transcended it, no.
