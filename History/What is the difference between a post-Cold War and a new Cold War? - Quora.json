We are not the good moral Country we used to be. We have allowed influences to take God out of our schools, courts, and Government. We have allowed negative influences to steer our Nation away from being an example of a \u201cShining City upon a Hill\u201d We have allowed people to guide us with soft words and visions of a greater world. That will come when our Lord and Savior returns. We have much work ahead of us. Russia can be a positive influence to the world if both sides stop trying to be the Big Kid on the block. Ask yourself what would happen if: The USA, Russia, China, and the UK were to join together. Not politically but as a unified power. Those are the Big Kids. Work together, stop trying to make all the Influences happy. Sorros and all his ilk must be dealt with. TIME WILL TELL. ",
