            "answer_text": " Freddie Mercury was diagnosed with HIV in 1987 and died from AIDS-related complications in 1991 at just 45 years old. However, because untreated HIV can lie dormant for eight to 10 years before AIDS symptoms appear, it\u2019s not certain when or how Mercury contracted the disease, which is most commonly spread through sexual contact or sharing needles. Because Mercury wasn\u2019t known to use intravenous drugs, it\u2019s widely believed that he contracted HIV from one of his sexual partners. As one of the biggest rock stars in the world amid the excess of the 1970s and \u201880s, Mercury had many partners, both male and female, and it would be virtually impossible to track each of them down and identify the one who passed the virus to him. Furthermore, the medical community was still scrambling to understand HIV and AIDS when Mercury was diagnosed. HIV testing was unreliable and hard to obtain, making it difficult to know for sure who was infected and when. The stigmatization of HIV as a \u201cgay cancer\u201d combined with a lack of knowledge about the disease made a diagnosis in those days more like a death sentence. Indeed, the stigma around his diagnosis prompted Mercury to keep it secret, just as he had kept his bisexuality under wraps as well. Despite tabloids publishing photos of Freddie Mercury looking sick, he wouldn\u2019t share his condition with the world until the day before he died, leaving the two loves of his life to grieve for him. Freddie Mercury\u2019s Two Great Loves  Freddie Mercury had two significant romantic relationships in his life. The first was with his one-time fiance and best friend Mary Austin. The two first met in 1969 when Austin was working in a London clothing boutique, near the stall where Mercury worked. He was far from famous, but she was drawn to his charismatic yet sensitive personality. He was 24 and she was 19, and in a matter of months they were sharing a small flat. Mercury\u2019s career began to take off in 1972, and Austin went along for the ride. The next year, he proposed to her on Christmas with a jade ring wrapped in a series of boxes, and she happily accepted. Soon after, he declared his love for her publicly by dedicating the song \u201cLove of My Life\u201d to Mary Austin. However, the pair never became man and wife. Their romantic relationship ended in 1976 when Mercury confessed to Austin that he was bisexual. Yet the two remained close friends for the rest of Mercury\u2019s life, even as he moved on to another important relationship.  Mercury met hairdresser Jim Hutton at a London gay club in 1985, when Hutton turned down the star\u2019s offer to buy him a drink. The pair would reconnect about a year and a half later and move in together after just a few months of dating. Their home life was much more mundane than you might expect from a larger-than-life star like Mercury. They loved relaxing together and spending time with their cats. Hutton recalled, \u201cI\u2019d get in from work. We\u2019d lie together on the sofa. He would massage my feet and ask about my day.\u201d Although gay marriage was still decades away from being recognized in the UK, the two wore rings to symbolize their devotion to each other. And though Mercury never came out publicly during his lifetime, Hutton understood and never pressed the issue. As he told one interviewer, \u201cWe both thought our relationship, and being gay, was our business.\u201d Hutton stayed by Mercury\u2019s side throughout his battle with AIDS, even as Mercury slowly wasted away and lost a foot to the disease, and was diagnosed with HIV himself in 1990. Again, it\u2019s impossible to say whether he infected, or was infected by, Mercury, or if the two men each contracted HIV from other people before getting together. Nor did it seem to matter to Mercury or Hutton. Instead of looking for someone to blame for the illness, they simply loved each other. However, by the time Hutton received his diagnosis, great advances in treatment had been made that would allow him to outlive Freddie Mercury by nearly two decades. Hutton died in 2010 from a totally unrelated disease \u2014 lung cancer. Now, as doctors report actually curing patients with HIV, the virus is no longer necessarily seen as fatal. But in the 1980s, when Mercury got his diagnosis, misinformation and dangerous stereotypes filled in the gaps of medical knowledge, creating a deadly scenario for everyone who contracted the virus. When AIDS Was Known As GRID  The first reported case of AIDS in the UK came in 1981, but sadly, governments and scientists were slow to react. In part, this delayed reaction came down to prejudice. AIDS was seen as a gay disease, and many even believed it was a punishment for so-called \u201cimmoral\u201d behavior. In the press, they called it GRID \u2014 gay-related immune deficiency. Because it was thought to only affect an already marginalized portion of the population, AIDS wasn\u2019t taken as seriously as it should have been. HIV wasn\u2019t even identified as the virus that causes AIDS until 1984, and HIV testing only began in 1985, two years before Mercury\u2019s diagnosis. An effective antiretroviral treatment didn\u2019t come along until 1996, five years after Mercury\u2019s death. And all the while, millions suffered from the stigma attached to AIDS and lost their lives to the devastating disease. Today, we know that the virus happened to strike the gay community first by chance, as there is nothing about gay sex that makes HIV transmission more likely. We also know that while promiscuity may increase the chances of contracting HIV, the virus can also be contracted from a single sexual encounter. Sadly, Freddie Mercury didn\u2019t live to see the great advances we\u2019ve made toward fighting HIV or the great strides the LGBTQ community has made in gaining acceptance in public life. While we still have a ways to go on both fronts, at least we\u2019re left with the music of Queen and Freddie Mercury\u2019s incredible voice. ",

            "answer_text": "I've read that Freddie was diagnosed with some strange form of Leukocyte problem in ~1982 - this is apparently now known to be an indication of possible HIV infection. That was before he even met Jim and as far as we know Mary does not have HIV so they're both pretty much ruled out as being the source. I hate that people seek to lay blame at Jim's feet. When he released his book in the '90s I remember the backlash against him and the criticism that he was trying to cash in on his husband's death (I recognise them as having been married even if technically they weren't). Jim knew he was HIV positive at that point and didn't assume he would live any longer than 6 months. His chances of benefiting from sales of his book were not great and Freddie left him something like \u00a3500,000 anyway so money wasn't the motivation. He would have just wanted Freddie back alive and with him. The book was a way to deal with the grief. I admit that, at the time, I also thought Jim was a horrible man and that he deserved to burn in hell for something (I have no idea now what he was supposed to have done wrong). I believe I was something of a homophobe back then even though I was sure I was above that. I hang my head in shame. I now understand what love is and understand that Freddie loved that guy. We're entitled to choose who we have feelings for and they chose each other. I did not respect that. I've literally grown up since then. Jim loved Freddie very much too and I am thankful for that. He was there with Freddie when he died and I'm thankful for that. He even tried to conceal his HIV status from Freddie because he worried about how that might affect Freddie. I just hope someone was there for Jim when he passed away. How did Freddie get AIDS? It developed after he contracted HIV. You can't catch AIDS. HIV is the virus. AIDS is what happens when the immune system fails. So, how did he catch HIV? IT'S NONE OF YOUR OR MY BUSINESS! It's pretty obvious how he must have caught it but if he really wanted you to know he would have put it in a song or made a statement to the press. It is probable he did not know exactly who he contracted it from. That's quite common due to the inhibition and incubation periods of the disease. My friend who is HIV positive has no idea who he caught it from. I've not met many people with HIV who know for certain who it came from. Condoms are a good thing. Please use them. Anyway, it doesn't matter how he contracted HIV. He was a musician, not a virus. What matters is that he felt so hounded by the press that he did not receive the full medical treatment he could have had. He stopped getting radiation therapy for his Kaposi sarcoma for example because he feared the paparazzi would get photos of him looking ill and attending hospital. Back in those days some people thought it was a crime to have HIV. In fact some people thought it was a crime to be gay! The real crime was that he suffered far more than he had to. The press have that on their collective conscience. ",
