            "answer_text": "The main reason people here answering are missing is the fact that Italy began rearmament in the early 30\u2019s, part of this rearmament included tanks obviously, so Italy built some of those. Their doctrine was not unlike the Germans, fast, mobile tanks able to punch holes into enemy lines quickly and cut off their enemies supply lines. The problem being is that while these tanks weren\u2019t bad compared to their contemporaries when being built, they were being built in the early 1930\u2019s, and as you know, WW2 began at least for Italy in 1940. Mussolini made the mistake of blowing his entire budget far too early, and when war was declared the already relatively poor Italian industry could not catch up to it\u2019s competitors. Italy did not have the industrial might to upgrade it\u2019s tank designs in any meaningful way, if they went to war during 1935, their tanks would have done quite a bit better; but even then, Italy was not ready for a war. That is the reason why Mussolini\u2019s generals were so reluctant to get into one, they knew the Italian Army did not have the necessarily equipment or division strength to fight its competitors. Italy did create some successful designs that could actually compete, but they came far too late, and in far too few numbers to make any sort of difference.  P26/40 Originally designed in 1940 (hence the 40) Produced in 1943, but saw little service as Italy capitulated during that year. This tank saw use mainly in the German Wehrmacht designated P40 737(i) and was actually produced in German occupied Italy for them. It is armed with a 75mm L/34, which is roughly equal to the Sherman\u2019s main gun.  This is the Semovente 90/53 tank destroyer, this mounted the powerful Italian 90mm L/53 AA gun, which like the famous 88 found use as an AT gun as well. This was probably the most powerful armored vehicle (gun wise) Italy manufactured, yet still, only 30 were produced.  This is another tank destroyer, or self propelled gun, it is the Semovente 75/34 based on the chassis of the outdated Carro M15/42 it is one of the few Italian AFVs to mount an anywhere near effective gun, and is actually the same exact gun mounted on the P40 above. This tank destroyer was once again built in 1943 and only saw minimal service and production, it\u2019s gun while adequate was still nothing to be fawned over. ",

            "answer_text": "Because of a few things Italy lacked the necessary materials to build very many tanks in the first place rubber iron all the other precious metals they needed were scarce as water in the Sahara and they might have have just been plain incompetent just look at this tankette, not light tank \u2018tankette\u2019 speaks for itself doesn't it  Its absolute garbage, armor thin enough for some rifles to go through if you can think of a worse use for 2 machine guns please tell me. Very simply just poor design there is also the fact that Italy is mostly mountain and their tanks had to take that into account. The best Italian tank of WW2 the P-40 Leoncello weighed only 26 tons because of the mountainous terrain they could also only build about 103 of them  Comparable to the Sherman in performance and this was an Italian HEAVY tank yes HEAVY and it was basically an Italian Sherman and I think that about covers it unless there is something else one of you can think of Edit:thanks to the glorious bastards who pointed out the submachine gun was actually amazing thank you ",
