            "answer_text": "A2A. Actually, it wasn\u2019t only the Mughals who had the Gates of Delhi built. The Khiljis, the Mamluks, the Tughluqs, the Suris and the British had quite a few gates built as well. When William Finch, an English merchant, visited Delhi in 1611 AD, he noticed that Delhi had about nine castles and 52 gates. I wonder how many of them have now fallen to ruin. By the way, Finch stayed in Jahangir\u2019s court for a year and a half extending his business interests and exploring commercial centres in Mughal India. Now, coming back to the gates. Mostly, the gates were built as a part of walled fortifications and outposts, the gates serving as an entrance to the fort. Soldiers could also defend the city from top of the gates using artillery and guns in case of an invasion. These two or three storied structures are generally outside the city limits, though as the city expanded the gates would have naturally come within the city limits. Sometimes, gates were also built to commemorate victory or as a memorial. ",

            "answer_text": "Darwazas were built to mark the extent of the Empire and respective kingdoms. It was kinda like milestones of those days and places where trade used to happen within the Empire. So they served as an employment generator. They were also to show people that beyond them they may have to pay taxes. ",
