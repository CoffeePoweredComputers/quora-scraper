            "answer_text": "As a Christian that was born and bred amongst the. Northern muslims,i try to avoid religious talks. There are a lot of sentiments attached to religion as a whole in nigeria,both by the Christians and Muslims. There are basically 2 types,as seen by christians. The peaceful loving ones who share meals with you during sallah and are tolerant and loving towards Christians and other religions.The radical and hypocrital..types who see christians as infidels and should not be allowed to live. But there are grey areas in this matter,as there are people who neither fall between this categories. They just don't like what they do not undastand,but won't have Ill feelings towards a Christian,as far as he doesn't show any contempt for their religion(muslim).",
