            "answer_text": "Poland has been an independent country for as long as the USSR existed (and also prior to that in history), although after WWII it has not been independent in practice. There was quite a bit of bad blood between the USSR and Poland during and after WWII (the liberation from the Nazi Germany is not the entire story). Also, the people got tired of the USSR dominance and put up significant resistance in the 1980s, see Solidarity (Polish trade union). Poland was the first domino to fall in the USSR-lead block, and a major reason why the USSR agreed to withdraw its troops from Eastern Germany (supplying them through an unfriendly Poland would be difficult). The three Baltic countries - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (Litva in Russian) have only been included in the USSR before WWII, against their will. They have been independent countries for 20 years by then (some of them have significant history of statehood before their inclusion in the Russian empire). Their languages are not Slavic, and their culture has been very different from the Russian culture. They have been the first show to drop within the USSR. Ukraine, on the other hand, had a relatively shorter history of statehood, but at the same time was a founding member of the UN (same true for Belarus). Its Slavic language is mutually intelligible with Russian, and the cultures are significantly closer. Ukraine and Russia share significant common history. Some classic Russian-language writers lived in Ukraine, and some classic Ukrainian-language writers spent significant time in Russia.  The drive for the independence of Ukraine in the 1990s has not been as overwhelming as the drive for the independence of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. In part, Ukraine became independent for political reasons, because the USSR was clearly falling apart and a popular mood in Russia was \"to stop feeding other republics\" (in 2013 Russians were calling for a union again). Some people in Ukraine (such as the first president Leonid Kravchuk, a Communist Party functionary) had a strong vision for independent Ukraine in cultural and political terms. However, other people (such as the second president Leonid Kuchma, the director of rocket-building plant who couldn't quite speak Ukrainian) were more grounded in economics and realized that Ukrainian industry was heavily tied to the Russian industry. Poland and the three Baltic countries made an early and very deliberate decision to sever industrial ties to Russia. The Baltic countries gave up entire industries that supplied Russia but were not competitive in the EU markets. Such drastic measures would have been a lot more painful in Ukraine, so they were not taken. As a result, Ukraine remained tightly connected to Russia economically, culturally and politically. During the period when Russia has been politically and economically weak, the Baltic countries got their act together and established robust independence. Ukraine, on the other hand, flailed around along with Russia. By the early 2000, Russia started more assertive policies in the \"near abroad\", which included increasing political influence in Ukraine, establishment of pro-Russian political forces, and even dedicated TV programming for Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. While pro-Russian forces have been strong, only a small fraction truly preferred a reunification with Russia. Ukraine's independence has been supported strongly in most regions, although Crimea always had a notably minority who wanted to be under Russia. While Ukraine had an exceptionally strong (Soviet) military when it became independent in 1991 and was able to repel Russia's initial attempts to annex Crimea circa 1993 (relatively easily), Ukraine's economy continued getting weaker, and the military has been reduced year after year. During the term of the most pro-Russian president from 2010, Ukrainian military has deteriorated to the point where it would not be able to put up significant organized resistance. Unfortunately for Russia, Ukraine has developed significant political freedoms from mid-2000s with free press and extensive links to the EU countries, including new EU members bordering Ukraine. Culturally, Ukraine has been quite close to Poland, and the countries are roughly in the same \"weight category\". Moreover, the educational system in Ukraine switched to the Ukrainian language after the independence. As you can imagine, after 20 years of independence the number of people interested in the return of USSR-style union with Russia has decreased, while the Ukrainian culture has become more popular. At every presidential election, the Southern and Eastern part of Ukraine that voted for a pro-Russian candidate has been shrinking. People of strong pro-Russian persuasion became older and more desperate. In a way, this prompted Russia to act. After Russia's annexation of Crimea, all remaining regions of Ukraine supported the same presidential pro-EU candidate who won in a single round. In subsequent parliamentary elections, Communists didn't pass the minimum needed to be represented, while politicians with ties to Moscow who ran as \"Opposition Block\" received about 10% of the vote.

            "answer_text": "They screwed it up by: not going for privatization of the economyfailing to maintain a minimum of rule of lawThe policy in Ukraine from what I know was maintaining big, state-owned conglomerates and \u201ccompanies\u201d at all costs, the reasoning being that they provide a lot of employment and are important economically. Poland, in contrast, let the big conglomerate and state-owned enterprises generally sink or swim in the marketplace and generally let free market work. Most SOEs sank, either bankrupting or being restructured and sold to foreign investors. In the meantime, more free-wheeling and less corrupt economy provided enough internal demand and has grown enough export capability that SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) could grow. Relatively better rule of law has also made Poland attractive location for outsourcing. The results: Nowadays Ukraine has about $8,000 GDP per capita (in PPP terms) vs estimate $6780 in 1990, only 17% of growth through all these years! Poland has ~$26,000 GDP per capita in PPP terms today, which is growth of about 333% in comparison to year 1990 (when Poland has had estimated $5995 GDP per capita - less than Ukraine had back then!). During commie times Poland has always had the family, the nation and the religion (in that order of importance) to fall back to from failures of socialism. In Ukraine, all of that has been deliberately devastated by 70 years of Soviet rule. So when the time for important changes came after 1990, they had no cultural and social capital to draw from in order to build workable polity. I call it \u201cStalin\u2019s revenge\u201d (analogous to the term \u201cHitler\u2019s revenge\u201d you might have heard). ",
