            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a number of reasons why the lions rest for such long periods of time (up to 20 hours! I almost wish I could be able to sleep so well). It can be for energy conservation, to avoid the intense heat of their habitat, or because there is a distinct lack of prey for them to hunt. There is also social reasoning for lions resting so much, as they sleep in groups and strengthen their bonds among each other by head rubbing, playing etc. ",

            "answer_text": "No, they don\u2019t. If they did, they\u2019d starve. What lions and most large predators do, and do very well, is conserve energy. That\u2019s why they lie around so much, because there is no payoff for them in spending energy on useless activity. They spend most of their energy to catch food, defend the cubs, and in mating activity and when they are not doing those things, they rest up. ",
