            "answer_text": "Then the LORD said to Moses, \u201cGet up early in the morning and present yourself to Pharaoh. Tell him:  This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews says: Let My people go, so that they may worship Me. Otherwise, I am going to send all My plagues against you, your officials, and your people. Then you will know there is no one like Me in all the earth. By now I could have stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with a plague, and you would have been obliterated from the earth. However, I have let you live for this purpose: to show you My power and to make My name known in all the earth.   Exodus 9:13-16 (HCSB) wsb.to/Exodus9:13-16For the Scripture tells Pharaoh: I raised you up for this reason so that I may display My power in you and that My name may be proclaimed in all the earth.  Romans 9:17 (HCSB)  Pharaoh is said to have been raised up by God that Jehovah could demonstrate His power in the Egyptian ruler and \"that My name might be proclaimed throughout the whole earth\" (v. 17). Both goals of God were accomplished well. Not even the power of the great Egyptian pharaoh was sufficient to thwart the eternal purpose of God or to prohibit Him from blessing and delivering His people. The Scripture Paul quotes is Exodus 9:16, where the Hebrew verb amadth, meaning \"stand,\" is used for the expression \"I raised you up.\"  God put Pharaoh in a position of being the Egyptian king. He also preserved him there in spite of his disobedience so that God's purpose might be fulfilled. The purpose was that His name might be declared throughout the earth (cf. Ex. 15:14; Josh. 2:10; 9:9; 1 Sam. 4:7-9). Who doesn't know the story of the Exodus and the parting of the Red Sea? The whole world knows what God did that day.
