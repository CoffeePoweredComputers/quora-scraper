If you commit a serious crime or you are undocumented of course you are subject to removal from the United States. Having a job doesn't mean anything even of you are a lawful person and pay taxes. Follow all the laws of the U.S and respecting it's laws will help but if you are here unlawfully you will eventually be detained and deported ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the ATA. Yes, although in certain cases maintaining an appropriate job is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition to maintain valid status and avoid the risk of deportation. For example, on a work visa such as H-1B, L-1, O-1, TN, P-1, etc, holding down the job that got you the visa is required to stay legally in the country. F-1 OPT is not tied to a specific job, but allows for only limited periods of unemployment. Maintaining the employment required by these visas is therefore necessary to avoid possible deportation. If you lose the job, you would need to either quickly find alternative employment willing to sponsor you, or leave the country. However you can still be deported for other reasons, including criminal activity or accepting employment other than employment with the job that sponsored you for the visa. ",
