            "answer_text": "10 Reasons Why The Aztecs Were A Great Civilization  A lot of what follows depends on what you mean by \u201cgreat\u201d civilization. There was an old way of thinking about human development which maintained that all civilizations progress through the exact same steps, from the stone age forward. But that\u2019s now widely discredited. Here, then, are 10 intuitively plausible reasons to think the Aztec civilization was great. #1 The Aztecs drew on more than a thousand years of mostly sedentary civilization in Mesoamerica, beginning likely with the Olmecs. #2 They had fantastic forms of art. #3 They had deep and rich traditions, such as the Day of the Dead\u2014and despite what some people claim, it\u2019s perfectly fine to participate in it if you\u2019re not Mexican. #4 They had their own ideographic language, which James Lockhart details in his monumental work. #5 They produced enormous city centers. They were so large, in fact, that Tenochtitlan would have rivaled anything in Spain by the time the Spaniards arrived. #6 The Aztec language, Nahuatl, was the dominant one used for trade in Mesoamerica by the time the Spaniards arrived. Even the Maya were influenced by it. #7 They had advanced farming techniques and irrigation systems, which is how they turned a marshy bog into the prosperous city that was Tenochtitlan. #8 They were fantastic warriors, as the Romans were, which is why they conquered most of what is now central Mexico. #9 They were politically adept, which is why they had an \u201cempire,\u201d which was really an alliance among three main cities around Lake Texcoco. #10 They were a philosophical culture\u2014typically deemed to be the mark of most advanced civilizations\u2014where they expressed their views from the understanding of god as nature (ometotl), to how we should live with each other (a form of virtue ethics). This last point has been the slowest to be recognized among scholars since there has been an aversion in \u201cWestern\u201d philosophy to exploring other cultures. Yet, I\u2019m one of a small (but growing) number of philosophers looking to recover Aztec wisdom for modern life. My main contribution to the field is in articulating the Aztec conception of ethics (that\u2019s so you can find me on Academia.edu). I also run a newsletter on philosophy as a way of life that draws from Aztec philosophy (among other world traditions). So I think that we are beyond the point where people will unthinkingly accept the history that the conquistadors wrote. And if you do that, you\u2019ll find there\u2019s a lot to be learned from a culture that has been buried by five-hundred years of bad press. Note: Beginning photo by fer gomez on Unsplash ",

            "answer_text": "May I alter your question to ask, in the annuals of history, why are the Aztecs regarded as a great civilization? Their magnificent Tenochtitlan city, around the time of Cortes was at the height of it\u2019s splendor. Built on an island in the middle of a lake, 7 500 feet above sea level, it was connected to the lake shore by three long causeways. Aqueducts supplied it with fresh water from the surrounding hills. Their magnificent structures of pyramids, temples, palaces and aqueducts. All architecture was based on cosmology, astrology and religion.Each building was built hand to hand and stone by stone. Their skills in metallurgy and precious stones for the time, was nothing short of mind boggling for the time .The Aztecs did not have a written language, rather carved imagery which indicated a sound and could be understood in any direction.
