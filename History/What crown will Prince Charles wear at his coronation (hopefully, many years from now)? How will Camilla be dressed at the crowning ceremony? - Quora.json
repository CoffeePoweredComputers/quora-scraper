            "answer_text": "There are two aspects to this answer. First, there\u2019s the regalia that\u2019s used (and worn) by British monarchs. Second, there\u2019s a particular kind of coronation outfit specifically for male monarchs. Starting with the regalia, during British coronations, the monarch is presented with spurs, an orb, two different sceptres, and a ring. The monarch is also crowned with the St Edward\u2019s Crown. As an example, see the following image of Queen Elizabeth II holding the two sceptres and wearing the St Edward\u2019s Crown:  After the actual crowning, the monarch will then wear the Imperial State Crown, such as Elizabeth II is pictured wearing, along with her orb and sceptre:  Along with this comes a whole array of robes for the coronation day. First, the monarch wears a red velvet, ermine-lined robe. Then, during the anointing and investment, different layers of special and even holy robes are used as undergarments. These are topped with the Robe Royal, which is gold in appearance (this is what Elizabeth is wearing in the first image). Finally a purple, ermine-lined Imperial Robe is worn when the monarch leaves Westminster Abbey (this is what Elizabeth is wearing in the second image). These robes and regalia will be worn by both kings and queens at coronations. These will be worn by Charles too. But when it comes to clothes other than robes, there is a dress-code for male monarchs. This is what the last king, George VI, wore:  Under his robe, he wore a purple surcoat. For the lower section of his body, he wore white breeches (along with a decorative garter, symbolising the Order of the Garter), and black heeled shoes with buckles. It\u2019s very similar leg-wear to what the princes are pictured as wearing in this image (notice the garter there too):  However, it\u2019s been speculated that Charles will want a more dressed-down coronation, meaning we might not see him in those white breeches and heels. Instead, it\u2019s been rumoured that he wants to wear his naval uniform. So, we might actually end up seeing him with a uniform under the robe, something like what he wore when he was invested as Prince of Wales:  ",

His Majesty the King will wear the St Edwards Crown, just as monarchs have done since 1661, when it was created for Charles II:  Her Majesty the Queen will be dressed in a simple but elegant white gown, and will likely wear \u201cQueen Mother's Crown\u201d, the one created for the wife of George VI when she was crowned Queen Consort.
