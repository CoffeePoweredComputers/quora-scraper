            "answer_text": "Why did the 18th century European soldiers dress so formally in battle? Because combat in that period was first and most importantly a psychological process In that period, armies fought over land. If you led an army out to battle, and the enemy scattered and ran away, while your troops remained standing on the land, then you win. It isn\u2019t about killing very many of the enemy, or even any of them at all, it is about making them run away from the land that you want to control. But not just run away in good order. Because an organized army can attack you later. They can raid your supply convoys. They can do many kinds of unpleasant things. You need to get them to disperse. Specifically, you need to scare the enemy troops so much that they become deserters. That is how you win: scaring the enemy troops into deserting. That, or taking them prisoner. Or killing them, that works also, but if you look at the actual casualty counts from battles in that period, they were actually very low. Not zero, however. The best way to scare some guy into deserting is to kill the guy next to him. Actually, if you kill one guy, you might scare more than one of his buddies into running away. But it isn\u2019t just that simple. Casualties are far from the only psychological factor. Which brings us to the uniforms that you were asking about. Because looking well organized and intimidating is part of the psychological ploy. If your buddy gets killed by a rag-tag mob of dirty disorganized schlubs, then you will probably stand and fight. If your buddy gets killed by brightly-colored, highly organized, disciplined professional soldiers, you will probably shit yourself, drop your musket, and scram. But not only do the uniforms intimidate the enemy, they also bolster the morale of the side wearing them. If you show up to battle in regular casual clothing, then when the going gets tough, you won\u2019t feel very much shame in ducking out the back. But if you are wearing a brightly-colored formal uniform, then you know that if you run away, everyone will know that you are a cowardly soldier. You will get caught. So you stand and fight. The formal uniforms were weapon and armor as much as the muskets and bayonets were. ",

            "answer_text": "They did not. They might look like in the paintings in the first and maybe the second battle but replacement cloth wouldn't have had a huge priority among supplies, meaning that during the campaign the uniform would turn into rags and get quite \u201cun-uniform\u201d with every soldier patching his up as well as he could. Some parts of the uniform were more durable than others (the hat, the leather cartridge belt) and served as identification along with the regimental colours, but any regiment on campaign for any length of time would look more like a troop of well-armed beggars than the splendor of battle scenes. This was the case in prior to the 18th century but it was still the case in the 18th and even the 19th century. Uniforms were made with cheap, plentiful dies. Even if the cloth held up (and there are indications they did hold up fairly well) the colour did not, turning the bright red, blue or white uniforms into brown, blue grey and grey respectively. That is if there was not mud or rain or blood in the mix. So over time the uniform colour would drift towards a washed-out brownish grey. Soldiers also had a tendency, from the middle ages right on through the Second World War, to plunder the dead for equipment. Boots being the most obvious example as normal foot soldiers, if they received boots, only got two boots which could be worn on either foot making quite extensive padding necessary. But there was also an exchange in uniform parts, belts, catrridge boxes, backpacks, etc. ",
