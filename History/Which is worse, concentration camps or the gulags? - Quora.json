            "answer_text": "Both types of camps were horrendous, but the Concentration Camps from the Holocaust were by far the worse options. Here\u2019s why\u2026 In both the Soviet Gulags, and the Nazi Concentration camps, you were subject to severe conditions, like starvation, torture and glacial conditions. You were also expected to work. But, there is a difference. In a Gulag, your work actually had a meaningful impact to infrastructure, and in a way so did the Nazi\u2019s, but sometimes, you did work for 14+ hours a day, all for nothing. Soviet Gulags were designed to be Labour Camps for criminals, or people seen as a threat to the regime. But, the fact was, being sentenced to time in a Gulag did not equate to a guaranteed death sentence. Whereas in a Nazi Concentration Camp, many people prayed that they would be killed, to be taken out of this world of pain and suffering. When Stalin\u2019s successors freed the estimated 3.5 Million people who were working at a Gulag at that time, they were allowed to return home, many had, of course, suffered, but few were permanently disabled. In contrast, when the USSR and the Allies discovered the Concentration/Death Camps, they entered acres of land with only dead bodies waiting to be burned, or literal skeletons who were just waiting to die. So that, in a nutshell, is why Hitler\u2019s Concentration Camps were so much worse than Stalin\u2019s Gulags. ",

            "answer_text": "I would rather die in a German shower than sell my soul for the soviet union. In the famous book Gulag Archipelago, Solzhenitsyn points out three things about both the the soviets and the Nazis. 1. The Ukrainians were desperately willing to switch to Hitler\u2019s side when they got conquered. 2. I quote the book volium 2 page 385: Or here, for your delectation, is one more interrogation prison\u2014the penalty camp of Orotukan in the Kolyma, 315 miles from Magadan. It was die winter of 1937-1938. A wood and canvas settlement, in other words, tents with holes in them but overlaid with rough boards. The newly arrived prisoner transport, a bunch of new interrogation fodder, saw even before being led in through the door: every tent in the settlement was surrounded with piles of frozen corpses on three out of four sides, except where the door was. (And this was not to terrify. There was simply no way out of it: people died, and snow was six feet deep, and beneath it there was only permafrost.) And then came the torment of waiting. You had to wait in the tents until you were transferred to the log prison for interrogation. But they had taken on too much and too many. They had herded in too many rabbits from the whole of the Kolyma, and the interrogators couldn\u2019t cope with them, and the majority of those brought here were simply destined to die without even getting to their first interrogation session. The tents were congested, there was no room to stretch out. You lay there on the bunks and on the floor, and you lay there for many weeks at a time. (\u201cDo you really call that congestion?\u201d responds the Serpantinka. \u201cHere they wait to be shot\u2014true, only for several days at a time\u2014but standing the whole time in a shed, so that when they give them a drink \u2014that is, throw pieces of ice over their heads from the doorway'\u2014it is so crowded that it is impossible to stretch out a hand to catch the pieces, and instead you have to try to catch them with your mouth.\u201d) There were no baths, nor any outdoor exercise periods in the fresh air. Bodies itched. Everyone scratched frantically, and everyone kept on searching for lice in padded cotton britches, padded jackets, shirts, underwear shorts, but they searched without undressing because of the cold. The big, white, bloated lice reminded you of plump suckling piglets. And when you crushed them, they splashed your face, and your nails were covered with ichor. Before lunch the duty jailer would shout through the door: \u201cAre there any stiffs?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhoever wants to earn a bread ration\u2014drag them out!\u201d They were dragged out and placed on top of the pile of corpses. And no one bothered to ask the names of the dead! The bread rations were issued on the basis of the total count. And the ration was ten and a half ounces. And one bowl of gruel a day. And they would also issue humpbacked salmon rejected by the sanitation inspector. It was very salty. You were very thirsty after it, but there was never any hot water, never. Just barrels of icy water. You had to drink many cups to quench your thirst. G.S.M. used to try to persuade his friends: \u201cTurn down the humpbacked salmon\u2014that\u2019s your only salvation! You spend all the calories you get from your bread on warming that icy water inside you!\u201d But people simply couldn\u2019t turn down a piece of free fish\u2014so they kept on eating it and then drinking. And they trembled from inner cold. M. himself didn\u2019t eat it, so it\u2019s he who now tells us about Orotukan. It was so congested in the barracks\u2014yet it kept steadily thinking out. After a certain number of weeks the survivors of the barracks were driven outside for a roll call. In the unaccustomed daylight they saw one another: pale, their faces overgrown with stubble, beaded with nits, hard, dark blue lips, sunken eyes. They called the roll by file cards. The answers were barely audible. The cards to which there was no response were put aside. And that is how they established who was left there in the piles of corpses\u2014avoiding interrogation. All who survived Orotukan say they would have preferred the gas chamber. This shows you that there is a worse thing than dying. 3. If you were in the German camps you knew you were a person doomed by evil. But the soviet camps were designed to make you not only doomed by evil but also have no moral justification for your suffering. In Auschwitz they would make you carry wet bags of salt from one side of the compound to the other and back, while in the gulag they would label you as enemies of the people for picking up a hand full of seeds from the ground and would crush you (literally) and your soul so that their bureaucracy and socialist dogma wouldn\u2019t move a Planck.All of you who say there was a purpose for sending people to the gulag I agree with you. But that purpose was not to build infrastructure for the soviet union because the tools they used where \u201cdated back to 40 centuries, even past Egypt\u201d. They were instead to make you carry those wet bags of salt for 12 hours a day back and forth every day for the rest of your ten years in camp. And if you die then this will be your treatment: volume 2 pages 209\u2013210 And this, too, the Russian cinema screen must see: how the last-leggers, jealously watching their competitors out of the corners of their eyes, stand duty at the kitchen porch waiting for them to bring out the slops in the dishwater. How they throw themselves on it, and fight with one another, seeking a fish head, a bone, vegetable parings. And how one last-legger dies, killed in that scrimmage. And how immediately afterward they wash off this waste and boil it and eat it. (And inquisitive cameramen can continue with their shooting and show us how, in 1947 in Dolinka, Bessarabian peasant women who had been brought in from freedom hurled themselves with that very same intent on slops which the last-leggers had already checked over.) The screen will show bags of bones which are still joined together lying under blankets at the hospital, dying almost without movement\u2014and then being carried out. And on the whole . . . how simply a human being dies: he was speaking\u2014and he fell silent; he was walking along the road\u2014and he fell down. \u201cShudder and it\u2019s over.\u201d How (in camp at Unzha and Nuksha) the fat-faced, socially friendly work assigner jerks a zek by the legs to get him out to line-up\u2014and he turns out to be dead, and the corpse falls on its head on the floor. \u201cCroaked, the scum!\u201d And he gaily gives him a kick for good measure. (At those camps during the war there was no doctor\u2019s aide, not even an orderly, and as a result there were no sick, and anyone who pretended to be sick was taken out to the woods in his comrades\u2019 arms, and they also took a board and rope along so they could drag the corpse back the more easily. At work they laid the sick person down next to the bonfire, and it was to the interest of both the zeks and the convoy to have him die the sooner.) The only way to survive is to use the zek strategy: Bullshit the guards so that they\u2019ll think you\u2019re working (so they won\u2019t beat you to death literally) but do the least work possible (because you will die from that work). PS lets hope we won\u2019t have to make the decision to which to go to ",
