The type where neither side could possible be right or wrong. Due to the facts are based on the practice, repeat, hypothesize and repeat again process. The laws of physics and formulas of theories are our best guess but like chaos theory suggests says we're always missing some details. A good example of what I think is a controversy would be whos religion is the right religion. Whos in charge of the worlds decisions. Whats keeping the global economy going, is it the politicians making jobs and determining who gets paid what they think they're worth. Where does the wealth really come from. How does it sustain itself and people to resolve division of class issues. How does it fight corruption and exploitation. Is it possible to live in a world without money, or one without the need of feeling bad about anyone else but yourself. Does it matter what we do. If so why, other then we're supposed to believe somebodys elses dream and view. A dream and view that doesn't work in our own interests and beliefs. Where the conflict begins and never ends. Is there a god, or are there many? does that mean everything is permitted? Or does it mean we have no control over what we do. If there is no god or gods, can we really be expected to believe we are going to be doing what is right just because we want to believe what we're told by authority. Be it for love or justice, Vengence and hate. nobody is actually ever in the right, there is no moral highground or even a god to stop bad things. There is no black and white in a world full of color. There is, but there is no line in the sand. Only the ones we draw but like an artists outline in comics and fantasy. They are just Ideas and concepts passed on in tradition which decides through action and reaction of consequences and rewards. The real question is what is truth and common sense. Wisdom and knowledge, Courage and bravery. We always redefine what counts but never change to raise the standard where it counts. ",
