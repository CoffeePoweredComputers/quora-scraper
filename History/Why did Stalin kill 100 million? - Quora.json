            "answer_text": " Alexander SolzhenitsinWhere are the skeletons of 100 million victims? Without their demonstration, the critic of Stalin, the liar Solzhenitsyn, is certainly anti-scientific. With the same success of any terrorist from Guantanamo, and in general, anyone can write a book \"Guantanamo is 100 million victims\". Why are there many prisons outside the US? Why can not they be closed? Why, if there is a prisoner of terrorists, then you can not judge them in the US and that they are in the US prison? Why are there secret CIA prisons in countries outside the US? There are more than 2.2 million prisoners in the United States of America, more than 1.65 million in China (Author: Roy Walmsley World Prison Population List (11th edition) The number of US residents is 325.7 million and the number of Chinese residents is 1.379 billion. And why is there more people in prisons in the US? Let us return to the answer to the question of 100 million killed by Stalin. Let's just use math and count. According to the census of the Russian Empire in 1897, its population, including Poland and Finland, was only 125 million people. Then came three wars (the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, the First World War of 1914-1917, the civil war in Russia, the 1918-1922, the three revolutions of 1905, February 1917 and October 1917 and the of Poland and Finland in 1918. If of these, 125 million deduct all these human losses (take 15 million people in 3 wars, about 15 million people - then the population of Poland and Finland), and famine and diseases, Emigrated from Russia - 2,500,000 people. 15 million dead people in 3 wars +15 million people - then the population of Poland and Finland + Emigrated from Russia - 2,500,000 people + 100 million killed by Stalin = 132.5 million dead people? And in Russia there were only 120 million. And we did not take into account the dead from diseases and hunger and did not take into account the harassment of the Red Terror in suppressing peasant uprisings Solzhenitsyn said 100 million killed by Stalin? Take and count and it turns out that the population of the USSR would be equal to zero. This contradiction proves that theses about 100 million victims are lies and slander.  Nikita Khrushchev (Head of the USSR, from 1958 to 1964)According to the archive data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR (a memo to Khrushchev from the Ministry of Internal Affairs), between 1921 and 1953, 642,980 people were shot for counterrevolutionary crimes, and 2,369,220 people were imprisoned - there were no 100 million repressed or killed! By the way, if you look at documents that 642 980 is also an incorrect figure, since it is not taken into account that many have been replaced by imprisonment Also out about 100 thousand out of 642 980 Khrushchev was very angry at Stalin. Former USSR KGB general Vadim Udilov talks about how Khrushchev's son was allegedly stolen from the German captivity by General KGB Sudoplatov and shot for treason - he agreed to cooperate with the enemy (with the Nazis). Compare. USSR under Stalin 2,369,220 people were imprisoned from 1921 to 1953 In 2011, there were 2,266,800 prisoners in US prisons. What conclusion can be drawn? Alexander Isaevich Solzhenitsyn is a writer, but not a historian. The \"Gulag Archipelago\" and the \"Red Wheel\" can be considered a reliable historical research objectively reflecting the era, with the same reasons with which the novel by Alexander Dumas \"Three Musketeers\" can be considered a textbook on the history of France.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s around 20 million, not that this fact makes things any better. The whole USSR population in 1939 was 130 million, so killing 100 million would have left the country deserted. Stalin wanted any and all opposition to the Party guidelines eliminated, out of the landscape. He imagined a country of people following blindly the Politburo directives. That is why entire populations were moved around, particularly the ones that were expected to fight/oppose the regime. Moving masses of people to a new territory would rob them of the knowledge of the terrain, of their established hideouts, etc. Also, moving into a new area means that everybody has to fend harder for survival, leaving them no time to oppose the regime. Of course that many died on the way or out of exaustion, diseases and so on. There were also the infamous Gulags, in which people with real or imaginary condemnations had to work, a sort of modern slavery, with little to no working safety conditions, scarce food and poor living conditions. The third cathegory were the ones with death condemnations, for again real or imaginary guilts. They were not as numerous as the first two cathegories, but this was the only instance where nobody escaped alive - with the exception of maybe botched executions. ",
