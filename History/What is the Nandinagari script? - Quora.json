            "answer_text": "Nandinagari was a Brahmi Based script that was used in southern India from the 11th to the 19th Century CE for producing manuscripts in sanskrit. It was used in southern Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. This script was the official script of the Vijayanagara Empire(1346-1646). This script was also used to write Kannada in the Vijayanagara Empire. It is one of the official scripts of the Udupi A\u0161tta mutts along with tigalari script. Nandinagari is very similar to devanagari and other scripts of the Nagari group such as Gujarati script and Eastern Nagari scripts. Vowels in the Nandinagari script-  Consonants in the Nandinagari script-  Comparison between Nandinagari and Devanagari scripts-   Nandinagari Manuscripts-    Coin of Sri Krishnadevaraya\u2019s rule with Nandinagari etching-  There about 5000\u201310000 documents available in this script mainly in the Udupi Sri Krishna mutt, some temples in karnataka and Kerala, and in Temples of Andhra Pradesh. This script was also used to write Konkani and Kannada when Goa was under the Vijayanagara Empire. I am of the opinion that this script may be adopted as a unique script for Konkani, it will be a unique identity for Konkani.
