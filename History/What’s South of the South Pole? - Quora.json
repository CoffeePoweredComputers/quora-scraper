            "answer_text": "You cannot go South of the South pole. When you are at the South pole there is only one compass direction and it is North. The poles lie at latitude 90 deg. North and 90 deg South latitude. It is no longer a line of latitude it is a singular point. It is a dot. At that point all lines of longitude meet as well. To travel in any direction away from that dot will require a movement North. Once you move away from the pole you will no longer be at lat 90 deg S and the options of traveling in an Eastward, Westward, Southward, and Northward direction will return. ",

At the North Geographic guess what? There is NO East or West. The only direction is SOUTH. You want to travel away from the pole you have to do so using polar coordinates - a bearing and a distance. After about 111 km you will have travelled to approximately latitude 89 degrees. ",
