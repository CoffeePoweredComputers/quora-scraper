            "answer_text": "Seriously? No, sadly Trump has made the US a far worse country from almost every viewpoint. Where do we even start? Democracy \u2013 Trump has undermined the very fabric of American democracy and our system of checks and balances. You can argue that it started before Trump \u2013 I\u2019ll accept that, but no president in the last 150 years has managed to do more damage to the American system than Trump. He has ruled by executive order, lied to congress and the American people, consistently undermined the rule of law, was impeached by the US House, personally benefitted from ignoring the emoluments clause and the Hatch Act to weaponizing the department of Justice. That doesn\u2019t count the damage to the courts, the Departments of Education, Agriculture and State; the Post Office, the National Parks and BLM as well as many others - all done by ignoring the rule of law and the rightful role of the President. His betrayal of and retaliation against anyone who questions his legally and morally questionable activities will be an on-going shameful legacy. His personal corruption and the corruption within his administration (not to mention the nepotism) is unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in the last 100 years - just look at the number of convictions and indictments, not to mention the things that are obviously illegal but not addressed due to the administration politicizing the DOJ. The US is a less free and fair place as a result. Foreign Relations \u2013 the Trump administration has been a train wreck. He has insulted and alienated our allies. The latest Pew research shows that the majority of our western European allies find Putin and Xi Jinping more trustworthy than the president of the United States. He\u2019s betrayed allies like the Kurds and the Afghans. He\u2019s undermined and damaged NATO and our NATO allies. The US under Trump will never be able to lead an international coalition. He assassinated an Iranian political figure in a non combat situation. China has used his impotence to destroy the relative independence of Hong Kong, continue the imprisonment of minorities and to expand their power and influence globally. The only people who are happy with Trump are Putin, Duterte, and Kim Jong-un, as well as a handful of radical right wing nationalist parties. It\u2019s telling that one of the few international endorsements for Trump comes from the Taliban. The US as a country under Trump is no longer a global leader in things that most free and honest peoples care about. Security \u2013 whether you believe that Trump is compromised by the Russians, or simple Putin\u2019s \u201cuseful idiot\u201d, Trump has made the world a far more dangerous place. The \u201cFive Eyes\u201d have been watching his Russian activity carefully. The clear intervention in the 2016 elections and his blatantly obviously self-serving lies in denial \u2013 no, the Mueller report did not exonerate him and the Republican lead congressional review agrees with all of our security services that the Russians interfered on his behalf, his betrayal of US allies and handing over of US bases in Syria to the Russians, his support of Russia in the G8 despite Crimea, the \u201cprivate\u201d chats with Putin sans even the interpreters that every other president (and leader) uses, the undermining of the US alliances, reduction of troops in Germany and refusal to even discuss the reported bounties on US soldiers and of course the obvious and blatant attempts to interfere in the 2020 elections all point to unprecedented Russian influence in the White House. His unilateral pulling out of the Iran agreement was opposed by almost all of our allies. His attempts to illegally use US foreign policy in places like the Ukraine for personal gain by requiring an investigation into a political rival\u2019s family and asking China to do the same makes the US look like a banana republic. Trump is an authoritarian who likes authoritarians. Does anyone think our allies respect or trust us under this regime? Internationally the US is looked on with a mixture of pity and horror as well as a bit of disbelief. The US (and the rest of the globe) is less safe as a result of Trump. Economy \u2013 Trump has dramatically increased the US national debt \u2013 handing huge tax breaks to the wealthy and corporations, but providing little for the average American and left the government in a position that makes it difficult to react in effective ways to the current economic disaster. He\u2019s started an unwinnable trade war with China and the citizens of the US are paying for it. Those tariffs are being passed on \u2013 they\u2019re far more expensive for the US than China. American farmers have lost access to markets that they will never regain \u2013 the Chinese understand the weaponization of trade policy well \u2013 in fact today he\u2019s proposed $46B in aid to US farmers as a direct result of the fallout from his failed trade policy. He\u2019s put the US dollar on a perhaps unstoppable slide as the world reserve currency \u2013 our children and grandchildren will suffer for this. He\u2019s stopped the education and immigration of the world\u2019s best and brightest to the US \u2013 they will no longer be enriching the US as they don\u2019t feel welcome. It\u2019s a boon to Canada and Western Europe though. Western European immigration is at a net negative for the first time since prior to WWII. Immigration and immigrants as well as the \u201ceducation export\u201d have been a huge boost to the US economy. No longer. The stock market is up, but it\u2019s fragile, and a limited percentage of the US populace is benefiting. The income inequality is becoming even more pronounced. The Pandemic which was going to \u201clike a miracle\u201d disappear, is devastating the US economy and Trump has tried to use it for his political advantage. The US is now and will continue to be poorer as a result of the Trump presidency. The environment \u2013 he\u2019s rolled back environmental rules and regulations on anything and everything he can. The US now has dirtier air, filthier water ( four years on we\u2019ve still got issues in Flint), more pollutants, more dangerous chemicals in our water, food and air. He\u2019s taken us out of the Paris climate accord and not just denied the issues surrounding global warming, he\u2019s been actively anti-science and opposed to evidence based evaluation. The US is a dirtier and more polluted place as a result of this administration. COVID-19 \u2013 his catastrophic failure of leadership has left the US in a terrible position. 210,000 plus (at least) dead \u2013 the vast majority of those avoidable. With 4% of the world\u2019s population, we have 20% of the cases. He lied to the American people about the severity of the disease, he has fomented distrust and dissention between the states. He has spread misinformation and disinformation about treatments, the severity of the disease and risk factors. He has done little to support the medical community or the treatment of members of the public. Beyond the horrific death toll and the lingering health issues for many of those who have been infected and survived, the economic impact of COVID-19 is going to be disastrous and long lasting \u2013 and it did not need to be. There are many, many examples around the world of countries with real leaders who have been able to contain the spread of the disease, limit the casualties and provide economic support to their people. Trump and his enablers continue to add to the medical, social and economic impact of the Pandemic in America. The US is the global poster child for how not to address a global pandemic. Racism, propaganda and civil society \u2013 He has actively encouraged racism. No, there were not good people \u201con both sides\u201d in Charlottesville, yes, he was cited for violating the fair housing act. It\u2019s not, nor ever was the \u201ckung flu\u201d or the \u201cChina virus\u201d. The supposed caravan of \u201crapists\u201d and \u201cdrug addicts\u201d heading toward the southern border during the mid term elections was yet another lie. He is encouraging extremists and inciting trouble in states that he perceives don\u2019t support him. Kyle Rittenhouse? Liberate Michigan? The Proud Boys? Portland? Antifa as a movement? I can hear the screams about \u201cfake news\u201d and the \u201cMSM\u201d. Trump, his handlers and enablers have been working from a playbook that includes a great many things we saw in early 20th century Europe. \u201cThe best propaganda is that which, as it were, works invisibly, penetrates the whole of life without the public having any knowledge of the propagandistic initiative\u201d \u2013 a quote and the mantra that Trump and his handlers live by. Identify someone(s) to hate and demonize \u2013 an early Muslim travel ban, \u2018build the wall\u2019. Repeat the lies often enough and they sound plausible - at latest count the Washington Post showed over 21,000 lies from the President since the inauguration. Discredit the press and intellectuals \u2013 \u201cfake news\u201d anti-science to make it easier to continue the lies \u2013 on this it\u2019s crystal clear, especially from outside the US. The US is a less empathetic, fair, free and honest society and country as a result of the Trump presidency. There are so many other ways in which the US has become diminished under Trump that it\u2019s difficult to enumerate them all. Some of the damage may be irreparable. The majority of the world would love to see the back of this administration and an end to the decline of the US. No, the US is not a better country as a result of Donald Trump. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A, P. Whitney. Disclaimer, I am a Canadian and believe that I can provide a factual, non-partisan view of the USA from a non-resident. NO, I do not think trump has made the USA a \u2018better country\u2019. In fact I believe he has managed to make it the \u2018Divided States of America\u2019. IMO, trump\u2019s slogan \u201cAmerica First\u2019 actually means \u2018America Alone\u2019. He is achieving that goal, as the US has become a pariah around the world and the free world countries now look at trump & the USA with disdain, disbelief and DISTRUST. End of the American dream? The dark history of 'America first' U.S. Image Plummets Internationally as Most Say Country Has Handled Coronavirus Badly From day one, trump has openly shown that he has NO concern for anyone, any city or state leaders who do not worship him and acquiesce to his every whim. His insane tweets insult, demean, belittle, harass and threaten anyone who he believes isn\u2019t \u2018nice enough to him\u2019. He brags that he hires the \u2018best people\u2019, but his administration is a revolving door of staff that is fodder for almost every MSM in the world! His administration seems to be wholly composed of unqualified, incompetent, yesmen/women, whose main job is to \u2018protect\u2019 and soothe the savage beast that is trump. Trump has overtly encouraged and approved of the alt right supremacists, neo-nazis and other hate groups. There is a reason why he has the full support of the KKK, the Proud Boys and other violent bigoted groups. His rallies are ego massaging, bloviating hate fests, where his supporters are only one step short of becoming a violent mob. Since his campaign & election, the mean, racist, violent, acts against POC has risen dramatically. If he loses the election, I am very afraid the USA will once more have a civil war. At one time, I really envied the citizens of the USA, who seemed to have the world by the tail. Now, I pity those who see their country marching steadily towards either a full on dictatorship or a pseudo democracy like Russa. I don\u2019t know what to think about his supporters who seem to be so blinded by??? that they are deaf, dumb & blind to the absolute corruption, lies, self-serving, obstruction, petty cruelty, childishness, abuse of power and incompetence that is trump. I, and millions of other concerned Canadians are really hoping & praying that the insanity ends SOON. Otherwise, your country will not survive in its present form. :(( :(( ",
