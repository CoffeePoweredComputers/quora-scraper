            "answer_text": "Many of the wars in the Middle East are over the existence of Israel, which is viewed by many as a European colony in the middle of the Middle East. This led to wars in the late 1940s, 1967 and 1973 which directly involved Israel. These wars, collectively, are known as the Arab-Israeli War. The war continues to this day, often in a cold state. But also often hot, as well. It could be argued that the two wars over Iraq in 1992 and 2003 were extensions of the Arab-Israeli War, as well. The United States government had an official policy of working to overthrow the Iraqi government in the 1990s, and maintained a \u201cno fly zone\u201d over portions of Iraq in the late 1990s. This hostile attitude was largely to prevent Iraq from becoming a military threat to Israel. However, your question is correct to tie some of these conflicts to oil. The United States is also seeking to preserve its access to oil, which is viewed as vital to America\u2019s security. By keeping the Middle East \u201cbalkanized,\u201d i.e. divided into many states, the United States ensures that no single power controls all of the oil in the Middle East. In addition, the United States is seeking to ensure that oil is only sold in United States dollars. ",

            "answer_text": "No and yes That is the locals arer mostly fighting for other reasons.Land, religion, politics. Basically all the things people normally fight wars over. Their backers on the otherhand. Those countries selling cheap munitions and weapons systems, or even just giving them away at times? Yes, those are almost always in it for the Oil, Whether it\u2019s to have access toi the oil, stop someone else getting access to oil, or just controlling the oil and thus the ability to place pressure on those who buy from that production source. For them it\u2019s all about the oil.And considering that without that easy access to weapons and munitions the locals would probably fight less wars\u2026 In short - No, the wars aren\u2019t fought just for oil, but the willingness to fight so often and the meddling from outside powers? That\u2019s can pretty much all be put down to the Oil. ",

But can not shut down the wells because salt water will invade them & ruin the near worthless oil for future sells. They hope. Oil is in bad shape right now. Has been for a few year now. ",

But more recently the biggest wars are always ones America chooses to escalate, and America will only go and \u201cliterate\u201d your people if you have enough oil to pay them back for it afterwards, which you will be doing regardless of if you actually wanted their \u201chelp\u201d in the first place or not. So right now, it looks like its all about oil, but it isnt the only factor. ",

            "answer_text": "Pretty much, it\u2019s about controlling oil and for that USA and Israel needs to create terrorists whose ideology can be controlled, something that is incompatible with Shia Islam, which is the main reason Shia was branded evil and USA and Israel are out there to convert any Shia to barbarism like Wahhabism and Salafism and kill any Shia muslims who refuses. People like Kurds are easy to control which is why USA and Israel supports them. In the end, it\u2019s about controlling the oil and forcing all out transactions to be made in dollars, pushing the petrodollar demands allowing USA overvalued money to buy any goods they want in exchange for papers. There are fools out there who believes those wars are for noble reasons, but as history has taught us, there is no such things recorded in all of our history, wars are fought with greed and they are ALWAYS justified with lies, do you know any invaders in human history who has admitted invading and destroying countries to satisfy their greed? Nope, they always craft lies to make themselves look like the good guys, this has always been like this. ",

Lebanon saw islamists fighting Druze and Christian Phalangists. Iraq-Iran was Shi\u2019ites vs Sunni. The current fights in Syria and northern Iraq are more tribal in nature, as most of the combatants are Sunni. Now, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was for oil, conquest, and power. Saddam needed an external conflict to help keep his dictatorship going. If he could keep his people concentrating on other enemies and their perceived slights against Iraq, they would stay united behind him no matter what he did to them. ",
