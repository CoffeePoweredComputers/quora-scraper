            "answer_text": "They didn't really form an alliance with wolves, rather wolves made an alliance with cavemen.  The way the domestication of dogs took place is more of wolves domesticating themselves. Wolves and humans are both social, pack animals, so that makes them more likely to have an \"alliance.\" Here is what happened Humans go hunting and butcher a deerThey throw all their waste and bones and leftover meat off to the sideA lone wolf shows up and observes the humansOvertime the bravest and tamest wolves come over to the humans trash and get a free mealOver many generation the wolves that are the tamest are able to get a free biteAs you can see the wolves are on the way to domesticating themselves Over time this continues and the wolves eventually live with the humans. The humans  keep and breed the nicest wolves and kill the others. This is called artificial selection.  This process turns wolves into the dogs we have today. This alliance made has benefits for both. The dogs and the humans hunt together and the dogs protect the humans and the humans protect and feed the dogs.    ",
