            "answer_text": "Bob Myers wrote a good answer giving the technical history of when and color TV was invented. The problem with answering the question is that the switch to actual broadcasting in color varied from country to country. The ability to swap out older black and white TV set s to newer color TVs also varied and depended on people having enough disposable income to make a major purchase. Having said all that, in the United States, the big three networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC, started broadcasting a few of their prime time shows in color to experiment with the technology and to encourage more people to buy color TVs. The NBC peacock logo dates back to a time when NBC only used right as they were switching to a color broadcast. Imagine if you had been watching two hours in black and white and suddenly the animated peacock came on your screen\u2014it really popped! Within a couple years all shows were broadcast in color, but not everyone bought color TVs\u2014the old B&W ones still worked, after all. The switch to new equipment took at least ten years (depending on geography and level of income).  Now, in the Internet age, we swap out our mobile phones every two years for the latest crazy upgrades. Times have really changed. ",

            "answer_text": "The U.S. color TV system that we all knew and loved (well, tolerated) - NTSC color - was introduced in 1953. Some color broadcasting started almost immediately, but it didn\u2019t really start to become widespread until the early to mid 1960s. Oddly enough, this was NOT actually the first color TV system approved by the FCC. Two years earlier, a field-sequential (and therefore completely incompatible with the existing black-and-white standard) color system developed by CBS had been adopted, but never really caught on. The NTSC \u201ccompatible color\u201d system of 1953 was based on technology invented by RCA/NBC, including the fairly revolutionary shadow-mask color CRT. ",

            "answer_text": "\"When did the television change from black and white to color?\" I think it could have been as early as the 1950s, but few people could afford them. We got our color TV in 1969 but I know other people got them a lot earlier than we did. The main reason we got a color TV was because of Sesame Street. My youngest child was in kindergarten at the time and we watched Sesame Street a lot. I finally decided that I, not my kids, just had to see that program in color. So, on Christmas in 1969, that was our family Christmas present. It was a huge piece of furniture and very heavy. The screen was relatively small, though. ",
