            "answer_text": "QUESTION \u201cWill there ever be a new coin in the U.S.?\u201d ANSWER The US Mint produces a number of interesting products, but as of 2020, there are four coins that you\u2019re liable to see on a daily basis:  If you\u2019re wondering whether you\u2019ll see a new design, we think you will. The cent was given a reverse makeover in 2010, the nickel was given a new obverse in 2006, and the quarter reverse has been lent out to three different series since 1999, so this is the 22nd year of those. But the overall design of the dime, obverse and reverse, is the same now as it was when introduced in 1946. So we think it\u2019s about due. Ronald Reagan would be a great candidate for the dime. Likewise, inflation eventually makes fools of all currency. All of our gold coins are gone now, the silver came out of the coins in the 1960s, the copper came out of the cent in 1982, and the nickel in the nickel is still the same now as it was in 1866. So \u2014- that will probably go next. We\u2019ve watched as all of Europe went from noble metal to junk metal for their coins and we think that America is probably doomed to that route, since we have allowed our dollar to inflate by almost 30 times in two hundred years. The mission of the US Mint is to produce readily identifiable, practical, durable coins that the public can trust, and use to express their wealth. As it stands, the coin that the Mint produces the most of, by far, is the cent. Trucks and trains haul billions of these things every year \u2014 problem is, you can\u2019t buy anything with a cent. Vending machines won\u2019t even take \u2019em. The self-serve checkout at Walmart will, or the Coinstar, but usually it\u2019s roll-\u2019em-up and turn-\u2019em-in, and that\u2019s no good. America should accept a dollar coin, but, so far, they don\u2019t. Maybe it\u2019s because the Treasury keeps pumping out the dollar bill, but no matter what the Mint does, those dollar coins end up not circulating. The Mint gave up making them for circulation in 2012, and gave up the half dollar in 2003. (Our dollar coin is really popular in Ecuador and other dollarized foreign countries, we\u2019re told. But we digress.) So there\u2019s not one coin the Mint makes, that people use, that has the buying power of the first coin they made, the 1793 Large Cent. We\u2019re literally down to paper money and cards when we buy something more costly than a Snickers bar or a Coke, each of which now regularly retails for more than two dollars. We shouldn\u2019t have to plunk more than five coins into a machine to get a snack. If we can keep the lineup of coins we currently have for one more generation, maybe it won\u2019t matter. Maybe even the older folks will figure out PaySquare or ThumbIt or whatever comes next. But what will the kids do? Will six year-olds have bank accounts or PayPal and pay with their phones? Hopefully, the coin lineup will go to \u201cquarter, half dollar, dollar, five dollars,\u201d although it might go to \u201chalf dollar, dollar, five dollars, ten dollars.\u201d But the darned small change is not accomplishing much other than damaging our pants pockets for not enough good reason. Just sayin\u2019. ",

Oceans rise and empires fall, but I suspect the United States will remain a viable state long enough to issue different coins.There are new coins every year, but most of the are for collectors. Subtle changes are made to existing coins as well.If you are asking about different denominations such as 2 cents, 3 cents, or 20 cents, the United States tried all three in the 19th century. There\u2019s just no perceived need. Nor has the U.S. public embraced the idea of a $1 coin, despite the fact that many other countries have coins of similar or higher value.",
