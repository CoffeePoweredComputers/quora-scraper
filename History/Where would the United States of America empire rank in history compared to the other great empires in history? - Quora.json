            "answer_text": "The term \u201cempire\u201d is a little nebulous, but the USA is an empire in the same sense that classical Athens was an empire. In both cases, various dependencies and territories extend the rule of the government outside the nation from which the government is derived. If we are going to rank empires, however, we will need a better definition of what counts as an empire and how to rank them. Maybe it\u2019s better for now just to name winners in different categories. Largest by percent of land area \u2014 the British Empire, with 24%, in 1920. Largest by percent of population \u2014 the Persian Empire, with 44%, ~480 BC. Longest lasting \u2014 Guinness awards the title to the Roman Empire, but Japan has had the same ruling dynasty for 1500 - 2680 years. The United States would compete in the categories \u201cStrongest by percent of military expenditure\u201d (36% in 2017) and \u201cRichest by percent of economic output\u201d (50% in 1950). I am not sure it would win either category, though. ",

            "answer_text": "The United States of America is not now, nor has it ever been, an empire. For one thing\u2026 we have never had a ruling Emperor. Our Chief Executive, The President, is elected by a Constitutionally mandated electoral process and is limited to two four year terms in office by the U.S. Constitution(as amended) not the lifetime tenure often given to Emperors, and is subject to impeachment and removal from office if tried and convicted by members of the Congress, acting in this case as a court with appropriate trial procedures. Hardly an Imperial rule!! The world should be very thankful that the U.S. is NOT an empire, for if it was, and sought to expand its power as Empires often do, and fought as ruthlessly to extend its dominion as did the Assyrian, Persian, Roman, Mongol, and in modern times, the Nazi, Soviet, or Japanese Empires, all nations now complaining of an American Empire would experience one\u2026 those few who survived!!

So would be flat last in that respect after the Songhai Empire in Africa who conquered and held a few other countries around them. USA has long desired to be an empire and has copied the British and has Roman envy with it a senate and eagles but it's more of a manipulator behind the scenes. Any attempts at direct attacks have usually failed spectacularly except where they can indoctrinate the population. That they have \u201cfreed\u201d them like they did with the phillipines. That said who knows in the future, but I think the people of America would never allow the country now to be an Empire there would be an outcry. ",

It flirted with the very popular European practice after the Spanish-American War, taking strategic (at the time) possessions of the defunct Spanish Empire. Largely, to protect the proposed Nicaragua ( later Panama) Canal. But the actuality was problematic. So the USA would not deserve any sort of ranking in a serious list of Empire. BTW\u2026\u2026would you like to purchase Puerto Rico? Only $1.00 US cash, but you would to have to accept responsibility for its debts. It has nice beaches. ",

In fact, the USA could actually conquer Canada and many other countries in the Americas if they wanted to. (Without Europe or Asia interruppting that) In my opinion, it is technically a Empire since it expanded it\u2019s borders since it\u2019s founding. Even a Republic can be a Empire. It just needs to have at least once have borders that keep changing in a couple of decades. But to be fair, it only became one since it\u2019s neighbors were mostly somewhat weaker except for a few.
