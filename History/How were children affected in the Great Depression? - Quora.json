            "answer_text": "Horribly often abandoned forming groups for safety and walking from town to town begging for food ,or hoboing from one town to another .The movie Riding the Rails, describes life on the trains riding from place to place looking for food and work.A murder mystery named Night of the Hunter starring Robert Mitchum as a serial killer following two children that are members of such a group of children begging from town to town is a classic.People Often sold or rented out their children so that they wouldn\u2019t starve to death. Starvation was rampant in the United States and the whole world. When people talk about how we would be better off without a social safety net they have no idea how true hunger feels . Keep asking for an end to paying taxes to keep everybody fed and housed and you might find out what it feels like to be in the Great Depression .Oh yeah many people back then who found themselves without money committed suicide rather than live in the United States broke and homeless.
