            "answer_text": "Metal coins no longer need to have actual value no more than printed money does. Precious metal is not needed to sustain value, but \u2018world confidence\u2019 in the United States government\u2019s stability in maintaining its currency\u2019s monetary value is. Also, it makes little sense to put any precious metal in any coins. Coins represent a \u2018set\u2019 value; whereas, a precious metal\u2019s valuation fluctuates on the open market. In the future, as technologies progress, the need for any actual physical form of pocket money will become non-existent among modernized countries. However, cultural preferences and limited modernization capabilities will slow/prevent other countries down, so such electronic everyday trading will be hard to achieve globally. But, for America, and other fortunate modernized countries, we see this trend toward electronic \u2018everyday\u2019 monetary transactions becoming more dominant as the present, and each new generation, gets used to not needing actual physical money in their pockets.

            "answer_text": "Silver coinage (and gold) only works if the weight of silver in the coin is equal in value to the coin itself. As the price of silver increased, it became necessary to use less of it - either my making it less pure, or by making the coins smaller. There is no point using a dollar\u2019s worth of silver to make a 50 cent coin - they will just get melted down for the metal value. ",
