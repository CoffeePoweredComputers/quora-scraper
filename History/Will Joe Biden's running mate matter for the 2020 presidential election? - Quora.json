            "answer_text": "I think Biden\u2019s choice will make a marginal difference. If picking the right VP means a 3% gain for Biden on Election Day, he would be wise to make the right choice. Biden\u2019s got to pick a woman. That one\u2019s a no-brainer. If Biden were to pick a man, and then Trump showed his characteristic loyalty by ejecting Pence and bringing on Ambassador Haley, Trump could expect a minimum of a 5-point gain. As a woman of color, Haley would greatly enhance Trump\u2019s portfolio as VP. This would be enough to hold onto enough of the states he won in 2016 to secure him a second term. Biden can\u2019t take that chance. He has to pick a Democrat who offers the right blend of qualities. Elizabeth Warren would be a good choice for cementing the loyalties of the progressive wing of the party. It would also scare the centrist Republicans who have been thinking of supporting Biden. Warren and Sanders both have been saying that their supporters must get behind Biden. Any progressive who failed to turn out in 2016 because they felt sore about Sanders not getting the nomination knows how that works out. Only the phenomenally stupid and/or pig-headed among progressives will fail to turn out for Biden on 2020. I\u2019m not sure Biden needs to pick Warren to bring in their votes. Also, Warren is needed right where she is in the Senate. Also, she\u2019s white. Picking her doesn\u2019t exactly send the big tent message the Democrats want to send. Amy Klobuchar is a reasonable choice. She\u2019s a centrist, and she\u2019s strong in the Midwest. She\u2019s reasonably honest and reasonably competent. She seems like a good choice. I think she\u2019d make a good first women POTUS, if Biden age were to become an issue in two years. But she\u2019s white, too. Again, the campaign probably ought not to pick a white person for VP. In order for the Democrats\u2019 selection of an old white man not to upset their big tent message, I think Biden has to choose a non-white woman. I said this last year at this time, and I stick by that idea. In particular, Democrats can\u2019t keep reaching out to the black community for solid support without offering something concrete in return. It\u2019s great that Obama served two terms. He\u2019s just one POTUS. Picking one of the two black women from among the top tier of candidates for VPOTUS is the way to go\u2014especially given recent events. Abrams is a good choice. She has experience, and we\u2019ve heard her name before. She\u2019s a fighter with a good cause. I like her. I respect her. But the top choice has to be Kamala Harris. Harris has a prosecutor\u2019s background. She\u2019s a solid centrist. She won\u2019t scare centrist Republicans who are trying to justify to themselves either not voting in November or actually pulling the metaphorical lever for the Democrats. She has experience at the federal level. She\u2019s not a yes [wo]man who will tell Biden whatever he wants to hear. We know they have differences of opinion. That\u2019s needed. It\u2019s also in keeping with the way Democrats govern. Whereas arguably Abrams ought to be kept in Georgia fighting the good fight there, California has a raft of Democrats who can be sent to the US Senate to replace Harris. If Biden\u2019s health becomes an issue two years in, Harris would make a very respectable first woman POTUS. It has to be her in order for Biden to maximize whatever advantage a good VPOTUS pick can bring. ",

            "answer_text": "If you think running mates don\u2019t matter, you\u2019re ignorant of history. Bill Clinton made an unconventional choice of running mate in 1992, choosing a fellow Southerner rather than \u201cbalancing the ticket\u201d with someone from a different region, but that choice reassured many of us that he was a bit smarter than GHWB, who had picked Dan Quayle to pander to the religious right four years previous. Swing voters - those more interested in good government than ideological/religious purity - can easily be tipped one way or the other by simply imagining what has happened seven times in our nation\u2019s history: the Vice President taking over due to the President\u2019s death. Those indifferent between Bush and Clinton could decide based on the \u201cpucker factor\u201d - can you imagine President Quayle? For more definitive proof, I give you Sarah Palin. McCain \u201chad to pick a woman\u201d, according to the pundits. I called BS then, and Obama did, too. Trump learned from McCain\u2019s mistake, and chose his polar opposite (qualified, disciplined, and reassuring to the Evangelical wing of the Party), while Clinton went for non-threatening (and uninspiring) - and the results speak for themselves. Biden needs to choose a successor whom voters will recognize as ready to take over on day one. Choosing based on geography, gender, or race is a losing strategy. ",
