            "answer_text": "Although the two Princesses were moved to Windsor Castle for most of the period of the war, King George, against the express wishes of Winston Churchill (then Prime Minister) remained mostly in Buckingham Palace- and his wife stayed with him, and that included overnight. Of course during that time they visited other places, and spent time with their daughters in Windsor, but their full-time base was Buckingham Palace, King George always maintained that he wanted to stay with his people, even during the blitz. When the Palace was bombed Queen Elizabeth remarked that she could now \u201clook the East End in the face\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes he did, despite orders to the contrary. It\u2019s not well understood today how close Britain came to political collapse and the King was acutely aware that his brother was very popular. Neither he nor Churchill were Britain\u2019s first choice, and both had come to lead in odd circumstances, and without much of a mandate. So they couldn\u2019t put a foot wrong. The King understood this, his power as a symbol, and, if necessary, as a martyr. He was the King\u2026 and he behaved like one. The royal family owes much of it\u2019s popularity to this quiet and unassuming man, who did his duty. It was a bit of a batman and robin act with Churchill nullifying the effect of Hitlers rhetorical rubbish by, as has been said many times, \u2018mobilising the English language and sending it to war\u2019. And the king was the straight man, providing the image of an ancient kingdom governing by divine right and the natural defender of freedom. How did they go? Not bad\u2026 not bad at all. From this relatively small island powerful alliances were formed which tore apart monstrous regimes and replaced them largely, with functional modern states. To pull off such an enterprise, there needs to be trust. And that comes from the top. Britain kept it\u2019s word, fought for Europe, made no deals with Hitler, helped Greece despite the hopelessness of the cause, and kept fighting when others gave in, or worse. ",
