            "answer_text": "The premise is incorrect: Slavs in the Central Plain of Russia or Central Europe do not have a substantial Mongol or Mongoloid trace, either phenotypically or genetically. The main difference between Southern and Northern European type, including Russians, is in the extent of Neolithic settlements of Anatolian farmers. Phenotype. This is the standard model look,   that cannot be told apart, for example, from Polish (may be a bit less pride?): https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=polish+models  and the Russian football team after a penalty:  As for Hungarians, they look differently than Balto-Slavs not because they are \u201cless Mongoloid\u201d , but because they genetically closer to Southern Slavs (see \u201cHu, purple open square\u201d):  Why? Because Hungarians and Southern Slavs, as well as Spanish, Italians, and Greek have a large admixture from the ancient culture of Anatolian farmers that spread 7200 ybp, related to Minoans. In contrast, Western and Eastern Slavs are mostly native Western Hunter Gatherers and do not have much of the Anatolian admixture. The myth of Mongoloid component in Slavs, probably, originates from the fact that Mongols and their successors Tatars made Russia to pay tribute for 250 years. But do Russians have a male Mongol trace in their DNA? Look at the Y-chromosome haplotype map:  Here Mongol Y-haplotype C is shown by pink color. As you can see, C haplotype is spread in Mongolia, Kazachstan, among Buryats, Koryaks, Evenks, and, surprisingly, among native Australians and native New Zealanders and Oceania. According to this map, Maori are related to Mongols. Mongolian admixture of European Slavs in male lineage is a myth. If we look at European Russians below, we find mostly East Indo-European R1a, Paleolithic European I1a, I1b. For Russians living in the North, we also see North-Eurasian N. Poles have no N but have some West European R1b. No C is detectable in either group.  How is this possible? During Mongolian dominance until Ivan III, they took women from Russia to the Golden Horde, as a tax, and married them. No wonder Tatars are so European-looking and no noticeable trace of haplotype C is present in Russia: the gene flow from the West to the East. Genome-wide DNA studies confirm this assessment. Genome-wide study for haplotype N groups Russians with Eastern Balts. The Russians of Central plain (green diamonds) are close to Balts and far from Finns (blue and green on the right top). The North Finland is rich in haplotype N (green dashes). Helsinki population is more rich in Paleolithic I1a than N and, hence, closer to Europeans.  The origin of autosomal DNA is mostly Western-Hunter-Gatherers (blue):  Note orange color in Spain, Greece, Italy, and Hungary, but not in the North: this is Anatolian admixture of Levantine origin. Therefore, the main difference between Southern and Northern European type, including Russians is in the extent of Neolithic settlements of Anatolian farmers. EDIT: Additional maps for Slavs. PCA DNA (A), Y chromosome (male lineage) (B), mDNA (C).  EDITS: Dear nationalists: you want to discuss this issue, please accompany your comments with genetic maps and representative photos. All attempts to sell any ideology will be deleted. I respect nationalism, but not various supremacy theories. ",

            "answer_text": "Some Slavs are, some are not. So which Slavs is the OP meaning. There is genetic diversity and structure inside the Slavic populations of Europe. I have some details below, but the simplest answer to the OPs question is: For modern Hungarians, 4% or less of their overall genome is East Asian. Ethnic Russians tend to have the most East Asian admixture, some regions of Russian are upward of 12%. It seems Ukrainians and Poles also have some admixture, but not much more than Hungarians. Russians somewhat stand-out, but just a little more. As for phenotype: I\u2019m am almost certain that you will find more \u201cethnic Russians\u201d that look more \u201cEast Asian or Eastern Eurasian\u201d than you will Mongolians, only because Russians tend to have the most Slavic DNA of any Europeans\u2026but for Russians this varies by region\u2026 Slavic admixture  Source: Genetic Heritage of the Balto-Slavic Speaking Populations: A Synthesis of Autosomal, Mitochondrial and Y-Chromosomal Data East Asian admixture in Europeans:  Quantitating and Dating Recent Gene Flow between European and East AsianPopulations Modern Hungarians admixture with East Asians I will go into detail about the Asian stuff below. But what about the other ancestry, the vast majority? What does it look like? The existence of Hungarian on what was Roman Pannonia is a function of the mobility and power of Magyar horseman, and their cultural domination over the Romance and Slavic speaking peasantry (their genetic impact seems to have been slight). Some of the Indo-Europeans found? Volkswanderung - Gene Expression Yep, Hungarians basically look like some mix of Romanians, Slavs, and Germanic tribes that were conquered by Magyars\u2026 All of the above are Indo-European speakers. Nothing shocking there\u2026look ate their location? What really survives from those Asiatic warriors that came about 1,000 years and conquered the region, as well as forcing their language on the native population, which is non-Indo-Europeans (Finno-Ugric like Finnish and Estonian\u2026which came from Asia). It has been well-known that in the case of the genetics of today's Hungarian population, only 4% of our DNA indicates the Asian origin. Genetikusok szerint a honfoglal\u00f3k \u0151sei hunok voltak, \u00e9s a magyar az avarok nyelve lehetett I translated it from Hungarian (using Google) This is the route by which these nomadic Asians came into Europe. More: Phylogenetic and population genetic analysis indicated that more than one third of the Conqueror maternal lineages were derived from Central-Inner Asia and their most probable ultimate sources were the Asian Huns. The rest of the lineages most likely originated from the Bronze Age Potapovka-Poltavka-Srubnaya cultures of the Pontic-Caspian steppe, which area was part of the later European Hun empire. Our data give support to the Hungarian Hun tradition and provides indirect evidence for the genetic connection between Asian and European Huns.  Ancient mitogenomes reveal Central Asian (Hunnic?) admixture in HungarianConquerers (Nepar\u00e1czki et al. 2018 preprint) ",
