            "answer_text": "The truth is that Ancient armies, whether in Rome, Persia or china were nowhere near to how big the accounts claim. It\u2019s physically impossible. Most of the people were required for farming, if they sent off more than half of their populations to die then it would have meant everybody starved as they wouldn\u2019t have provided enough food. It makes me wonder about the Mongols.One thing that is not true, yet told as common knowledge by people is that they were all horse archers, when in fact they were splits into Arbans (units of 10) and only 2\u20134 of the Arban were archers (although all would have been equipped with bows).Each Mongol would have had 3\u20134 mares (had to be female as the riders would live off of a mixture of the milk and blood if they would not fish, hunt or gain food in other manners).Imagine that a single Tumen was made up of 10,000.That is 30,000 - 40,000 ponies.I get that they were used to be able to forage in the harsh, very scant forage of the Mongolian Steppe, but 30,000 mares would have taken up a hell of a lot of space, drank a hell of a lot of water and eaten a hell of a lot of grass (they were not grain fed).This is before even considering the fact that there are 10,000 soldiers, who each need weapons repairing, sleeping arrangements, food cooking, materials for fire making, materials for clothing, places to defecate, medical assistance and other things.They\u2019d have literally been like a plague of locusts, eating or burning everything in their paths. No wonder much of Asia is arid. Nevermind Saladins army. Can you imagine how many sheep or cattle must be killed per day in order to feed 50,000 troops?A single lamb can feed up to about 45 people, that\u2019s over 1111 lambs per day, just for one meal for the meat ration to keep people fighting well.That isn\u2019t including vegetables, drinking fluids, fire wood to cook it, water to clean it, grain for bread, space for all of this and space for troops to live.Most big armies ended up killing themselves or being killed either through lack of food or lack of hygiene.Many an army ended up dying through dysentery because most people didn\u2019t dispose of their faeces far enough away, the insects it brought killed them or brought nasty disease like malaria (which would have also been caught simply by camping next to a water source, which was required for drinking water and bathing) and being around human faeces for extended periods of time also pollutes the water, food sources and breathable air anyway. Only the Romans had any idea of hygiene (I think the Ancient Chinese may have also, I don\u2019t much about their history though to be honest) requirements of armies, hence the layout of their camps and forts. I have written before about the sheer impossibility of the apparent numbers in the Punic wars between Rome and Carthage, I\u2019m not going to go into it here as the it is too long winded. But the fact is that losses of 90,000 men at that time would have crippled the city, a city that controlled the surrounding areas by force and fear. Rome would not only have not been able to sustain such losses, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to come back from it. If you want proof then just look at Ireland. they had a population of around 8 million in 1847, before the great potato famine. through many thing like disease, killings and emigration they lost around 2 million. Even today, with many of the Irish families having many children the population has not recovered and is still around the figure of 6.6 million. I get that emigration and many internal strife's have hindered this growth, but Ireland is a massive piece of land that has some of the best arable land in the world. the Republic of Ireland has a population of around 5 million, it is only 1/3rd the size of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) which is 93% countryside still, yet has less than a 10th of our population.The ROI has the potential to easily sustain a population of over 30million and be rich, along with not destroying their extensive and beautiful landscape too much. Yet, they have never recovered. Bear in mind that Rome was constantly racked with internal wars, disease, fires that destroyed large parts of the city, using their troops for the expansion of the empire and other things it is only logical to believe that they would also never have been able to recover from the loss of such a large amount of troops in a single sustained war.

            "answer_text": "We rely on very short inaccurate eulogies on ancient wars. The battle of Marathon was but a few lines in Heredotus. You have hours long CG narrations on that. Not to mention movies on Thermophylae. No, one million Persians were not resisted by 300. More like 1000s were resisted by 300 who lost. Probably Alexander did not have the adventures in India but had a week\u2019s peek. Ancient battles were mostly hundreds against hundreds or in really big gigantic battles, thousands against thousands. Great battles that set up the Islamic empire were between hundreds. It is said Romanus Diogenes had a million against the Seljuks. You cannot possibly have food for a million in 1071. More like, okey, ten thousand and another ten from the locals. Medieval battles perhaps the same order, maybe double that, but with much more hardware and lifelong specialised training. With the possible exception of the Ottoman war machine. Even that was one horseman from this village, another in the hill five miles away, each with own land. The greatest army the mankind has seen until modern times might be the Ottoman army that tried to take Vienna and the rest of Northwest Europe in 1683, said to be hundreds of thousands, which is doubtful. Even that was wiped out by a few thousand Polish and Lithuanian mounted lancers within minutes. So, as history is bunk so is military history. ",
