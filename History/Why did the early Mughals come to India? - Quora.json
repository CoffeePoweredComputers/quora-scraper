            "answer_text": "Well, it was a time when Babur was landless, just imagine, \u201ca king without a throne.\u201d Well, Babur was with his army sitting in the mountains sorrounding Ferghana in the harsh cold, with Samarkand out of his hands due to a defeat to Shaibani Khan,and Ferghana,first looted by his step-brother Jahangir. Jahangir was killed by Shaibani Khan,and now he controlled both Ferghana valley and Samarkand. And then Babur was chanced to meet \u201cthe lady with The Golden Elephant\u201d, an old lady whose grandfather had served in Timur\u2019s Army when he conqured Delhi. She told Babur the story, of how Timur\u2019s army marched from Samarkand, recruiting tribals on the way to Delhi, of how they crossed the Himalayas, with Timur being a lame person, of the harsh weather conditions they had to encounter in Hindustan, and finally their strategies, especially against the elephants,of which most of the people in Timur\u2019s army had not even heard of. Babur got all of this on paper for future reference, because he too wanted to leave a mark on the world map, and what better place than Hindustan. And then, babur moved towards Kabul, when he heard that Shaibani Khan was hunting him down. You would be surprised to know that when he reached Kabul, he was left with only 20 supporters, two of them being his mother Kutlugh Nigar, and his maternal Grandmother, Eesan Dawlat, a \u201cKhanim\u201d, i.e. a lady with the lineage of The Great Genghis Khan, The Oceanic Warrior. Well, he got good news that the throne of Kabul was seeking a Timurid Prince to sit on the throne,since the king of Kabul had died recently, and his only son had died some months ago only. And then, some years later, when the Persian king killed Shaibani Khan, and when Babur acquired the Turkish flintlocks and cannons, he was all ready to conquer what he thought \u201cwas his birth right\u201d being a Timurid Prince. These people thought that whatever area Timur had conquered, they had a birthright to rule over those lands. No different was the case with Babur. And so with strategies of Timur at his hand, and superior weapons, he and an 18 year old Humayun rode for Hindustan, raising troops on the way. And then the First Battle Of Panipat was fought, where the Lodi king was killed by a flintlock bullet. Babur rode till Agra, which he made his capital. It was years of perseverance, preparation, determination and above all, a zeal to realize his destiny, to claim \u201cbirthright\u201d that led Mughals successfully to the throne of Hindustan. Thank you for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "tl;drThe reasons why Babur looked east to conquer India were:    -- Babur was unsuccessful to annex Samarkand and had lost all hope that he would ever be able to do it after he was unsuccessful three times.    -- India was too rich to be ignored.    -- Unstable political system of India that gave him the opportunity of legitimize the claim with the support from local rulers. In all, India was his best bet to expand his empire.  From 1494 - 1505Babur inherited the small kingdom Farghana surrounded by enemies from his father Umar Shaikh. Babur made attempts to annex Samarkand, and ruled it for small duration. In the pursuit of power to the throne of Samarkand, Babur ended up losing Farghana and had to flee for safety.  Babur now needed a safer base for his operation and he chose Kabul which was ruled by his uncle. After the death of his uncle, Babur took Kabul as the ruler surrendered after a short siege that lasted just 10 days. It was here that he first considered seriously about invading India. After 1505:To meet the expectations of the followers expecting rewards after he became the ruler, he levied heavy taxes on the people. This led to revolts and provoked his first march towards India. He eventually reached Bilah and then was forced to return. After this, Babur again made attempts to overtake Samarkand and was successful but only for brief time period from later 1512 to early 1513. He returned to Kabul as it eventually became clear that his dream of being a ruler of Samarkand would not be fulfilled. To pursue expansion of his empire he now turned east, towards India. The claim to lands of Punjab and  Ganges plain would be legitimized as they were once conquered by his grandfather, Timur. The riches of the this country could lure anyone and Babur was no exception. He remembered his grandfather's invasion of India. Fortunately for Babur, the political condition in India was not stable and Sultan of Delhi had barely any influence outside the city. The empire was held by the support of Afghans families which ruled small independent states of their own. Daulat Khan, the then governor of Lahore, invited Babur to help overthrow Ibrahim Lodi and place Alam Khan, Ibrahim's uncle, on the throne in turn for recognition of his ruler as Punjab. ",
