            "answer_text": "First: Quit doing that. You're doing no one any favors, including yourself. Stop reading about it. Second: read this whole thing, it's long but important. I just - the world is horrible, in a lot of ways. It is cruel, and it is unfair, and we look up at the stars and they do not look down on us, because they do not care. If there is a God, he will have to beg our forgiveness. We are lost in space, and the stars do not see us. But they're still there. The stars still shine. And so are so-bad-it's-good movies, and people I love, and my little cat, and - do you know who Chiune Sugihara is? You probably don't, he's not in a lot of history books. But he saved six thousand Jewish people from the slaughter by writing visas to get them out of danger. All on his own, defying orders, still throwing visas out of the train when he was forced to flee, he saved six thousand people. You'll hear nihilists say good can't last forever. True. But neither can evil. We can starve it, we can cut it out, all it takes is one person writing visas. One person having the courage to say no in the right time and space. Don't get me wrong, I understand your despair, your sorrow. How could I not? I'm mostly Jewish (by descent, not practicing). But the thing is is that there has never been a time in human history where darkness ran completely unchecked. And this darkness is not an accident, you know? It's not a curse, it's not an act of God. It's people, and people can be stopped. There is no justice in the world, not unless we make it. There is no one who can save us - we have to save ourselves. The world is what we make of it. And despair makes nothing but ashes. Despair makes you hopeless, makes you helpless, kills your will to fight. I refuse to despair, not when there are people in the world who would be fucking overjoyed that I'd given up, not when there are people whose cruelty is given more and more sway every day no one fights back. If this world is hopeless, then at least when I die I will have seen the sun, and flowers, and heard my cat's purr, and brought more light into the world than there was before I lived. At least I will know that I said no. A Jewish principle you may find interesting is tikkun olam - it means \u201cYou are not obliged to complete the work, but neither are you free to abandon it.\u201d You can't save everyone, buddy. But you can save someone. Maybe if you get lucky, you can save six thousand people. Maybe you'll just save one. Maybe that one will just be yourself. Either way, you live here, and we're not dead yet, so it's a little early to write it off. I am neglecting homework to write this, so here's some things you should read. One Atom of Justice, One Molecule of Mercy, and the Empire of Unsheathed Knives \u2013 Alexandra Rowland Here to Raze Hell And just so you can read it in the answer, here's the text of Invictus, by William Ernest Henley. \u201cOut of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced not cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance, My head is bloody, but unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears, Looms but the horror of the shade. And yet the menace of the years, Finds and shall find me unafraid. It matters not how strait the gate How charged with punishments the scroll. I am the master of my fate I am the captain of my soul.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is horrifying. Growing up Jewish, they show you this stuff pretty early, maybe around age 10 or 12? I can\u2019t quite remember, but it was memorably awful, although done with respect and done gently. It made a huge, sobering impact but it\u2019s important to know. Life is worth living. You have to accept that there are horrible things and wonderful things, and that they both exist. Time and experience helps. For me, I make an effort to NOT watch movies about the Holocaust. I already know very well what happened and it upsets me to watch it. I finally watched Schindler\u2019s List a few years ago and, while it is a good movie, it didn\u2019t make my life any better or help me to understand anything except that there are good people in every circumstance. Actually, the movie Life Is Wonderful is a pretty great example of resilience in the time of the Holocaust. It\u2019s not just the Holocaust, as I\u2019m sure you know. There is ongoing genocide in the world. There is unfair treatment to all sorts of groups of people, every single day. Here\u2019s my thought process. First of all, if at all possible, you have to take care of yourself so that you are not a burden to others. This is assuming you don\u2019t have any sort of disability. Think about it. If everyone just took care of themselves and their immediate family? But that still doesn\u2019t solve the problem. Ok. So, if you\u2019re still upset, you can join organizations such as Doctors Without Borders, or the Peace Corps, or Greenpeace, or a million other organizations that help people or animals or the environment. If you so choose, you can dedicate your life to helping people. OR, you can dedicate your life to making money so that you can use your money to help people. You can foster or adopt children. You can volunteer at a homeless shelter. It\u2019s hard to make these adult realizations but there are also ways to mitigate the pain and find joy and meaning in life. ",
