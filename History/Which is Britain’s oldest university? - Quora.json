            "answer_text": "Britain's oldest university is the University of Oxford. Nobody is quite sure when it was founded but there was teaching of some form by 1096 and a major institute by 1167. The University of Cambridge was founded when some scholars left Oxford in 1209 after a town-gown riot. After that, there were no successful foundations in England for over 600 years, although Scotland gained five* universities in that period. Between them, these two managed to have a university in Northampton shut down after a short period of operation, make sure Gresham College in London never amounted to much, and deny a college in Durham (founded by Oliver Cromwell) the power to award degrees. Plans for a university in York were scuppered in 1825 and UCL's attempt to be recognised as a university was defeated in 1830**, but Durham University was founded in 1832 (the argument against UCL was that it was not linked to the church, which possibly left them short of ammunition against the Bishop of Durham!) and then the University of London in 1836 (thwarting another attempt by UCL to gain recognition). *Two in Aberdeen, which merged in 1858 to give the current four ancient universities of Scotland. After the Union with England, there were no new universities in Scotland until the 1969s. **UCL finally got its own degree awarding powers in 2005 and is currently applying for university status again. It is expected to succeed this time. ",
