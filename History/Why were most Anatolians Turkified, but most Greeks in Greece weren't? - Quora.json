            "answer_text": "When Turks arrived in Anatolia, they settled in the mostly depopulated parts of eastern Anatolia. From there they had a \u201cheadquarters\u201d to further spread the Turkic language and Islam to other lands. It didn\u2019t happen in one day though. While the Roman empire was still standing, most Roman citizens in Turk-held Anatolian lands did not convert to Islam or change their language. Because they were disappointed with the Roman authorities since it was at it\u2019s worst, the citizens there preferred Turks as governors but not nessessarily willing to abandon their identity. This happened later and over the years. How? The most important thing is history. Turks prohibitted learning of Roman history and studies in general. People simply didn\u2019t really know anything about their past. They didn\u2019t know the history behind the Roman identity. To them, the only thing Roman had come to mean was trouble, a lower class citizen that has absolutely no hope of getting a successful career or a saying in political matters. If you were a Roman you would get looked down upon and pay more taxes. Even if you didn\u2019t look for trouble, \u201ctrouble would look for you\u201d. Turkish authorities were using any excuse to persecute christians. So a kid that doesn\u2019t know history, the only history it gets to know is about the \u201cgreat Islam\u201d and \u201cheroic Sultans\u201d, a kid who has no consciousness of his/her identity, is vulnerable to change. Not to mention that being Roman was not only disliked in the Ottoman empire but everywhere outside the borders of the Ottomans. If you were a Roman-Greek, Europeans despised you, middle easterners despised you and Ottoman authorities treated you like a zero. Living like that it\u2019s not easy and people were giving up. But the identity survived among many through these hard centuries. The reason Romans in Greece kept their identity was because of the church which tought some basic things about history and \u201cletters\u201d. But keep also in mind that in the core area of the Roman empire (Greece and Turkey) before the rebellion of Greeks against the Ottomans, the population in total was about 30.000.000 people of which a little more than 10.000.000 was Greek orthodox with over 2.000.000 christian Greeks living in modern-day Turkey. Of that less than 20.000.000 were muslim Turks, not more than 10.000.000 muslims were of Greek/Roman origin while the others were of Turkic origin and of course there was some intermixing. Conversion to Islam was constantly moving westwards and it reached as far as Thessaloniki during those 500 years of muslim rule. Which means that Turks were early dominant in eastern Anatolia (eastern Turkey) and they were spreading from eastern Anatolia all those 500 years westwards as far as Thessaloniki were muslims were contested. It surely took centuries for muslims to become a majority in western Anatolia. ",

            "answer_text": "Why were most Anatolians Turkified, but most Greeks in Greece weren't? In many ways Anatolia only became very \u201cTurkified\u201d after 1923, though that process had started back when the Seljuk Turks captured most of the interior from the Byzantines. While Asia Minor was largely Hellenized, the Greek/Romaioi identity was strongest along the western and northern coasts\u2014the Ionia, Aeolia, Doris and Pontos of antiquity that had long been part of Greece. As the Byzantine Empire shrank it was reduced more and more to lands that were Hellenic historically. So central Anatolia was settled more heavily by the Turks and became the core of their expansion into the declining Byzantine Empire. If one looks at Ottoman Demographics we see people being assimilated into Turkish culture with those who remained being increasingly pushed to the edged of Asia Minor. To compare, look at Anglo-Saxon settlements of Britain, with them settling most heavily in the South-East, and pushing the Celtic speaking people\u2019s back to the west\u2014a cultural conquest that reduced the older language and culture to the edge of Britain. If we look at the Ottoman Empire pre-WWI, there is still a heavy Greek element on the coast and Armenian to the east, among others. Genocides and expulsions and the Greco-Turkish population exchange left a much more homogeneous nation behind. As Greece, it did have a significant Turkish population. Some islands\u2014like Lesvos were heavily colonized by the Turks or had people convert, as did larger cities in Greece. At the same time many Greeks fled into the mountains live with greater autonomy from the Ottoman government. When the Greek revolt came in 1821 much of the Turkish population either fled or were killed, leaving almost none left in Southern Greece. During this time there were reprisals against Greeks in other parts of the Ottoman Empire. After the Balkan Wars Greece again had a large Turkish population\u2014in Epirus, Macedonia and Thrace, but this changed with the population exchange in which over 1.5 million Greeks fled Anatolia and about 500,000 Turks left Greece.
