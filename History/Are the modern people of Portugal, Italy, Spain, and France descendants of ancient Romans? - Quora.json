            "answer_text": "In Spain there is a saying:\u201dthree quarters Spanish are three quarters Roman\u201d, Hispannia was the most latinized province of the Roman empire(after Italia itself), if you travel to Spain/Portugal, and then to Italy you will notice that people looks very similar, being exception northern Italy: Milan, Piedmont, etc. as traditional Italy only reaches the Po river, territory further to the North was the Cisalpine gaul, and always inhabited by Germanic peoples throught most history(Gauls, Ostrogoths, HRE, Austria), but you probably couldn\u2019t differenciate a modern Roman/Neapolitan from a typicall Spaniard. Also, in northern Spain you can notice more blonde/ligh-coloured eye people due to a stronger Visigothic influence, while at Andalucia, people with black hair and brown eyes is more common as it was the core of Al-Andalus, (something similar as what happens in Sicily at Italy), but neither of these are as strong as you might think and latin blood is boringly predominant. For the case of France, latinization wasn\u2019t nearly as strong, the government elites were of course Roman, but the ordinary celtic folk didn\u2019t mix itself much with Romans, and also you have to account that the Gaul was swarmed with Franks from German territory at the end of the Roman empire.

This differs from UK and Ireland, which are Celtic and Germanic (Nordic one - Vikings/Normans - and Continental one: Saxons). The Germans are less germanic than people think. Slav culture, Celtic and Roman culture has more influence there than in Nordic countries. Just look to the all \u201choly roman empire\u201d thing. That said, the genetic map of Europe looks a bit like the cultural map. But also, Portugal is more Greek and North African than people think.
