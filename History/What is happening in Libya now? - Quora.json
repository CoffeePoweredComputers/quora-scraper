            "answer_text": "What is happening in Libya 2020? Two factions are fighting in a civil war, which started in 2014. The GNA government is based in Tripoli. It is recognized by the UN. It is headed by Sarraj, who is from a Turkish family. The LNA government has control over South and East Libya. It is headed by Haftar. Currently the UN prevents the sales of arms to Libya. But that does not seem to have stopped foreign powers like France from intervening. So where do various countries side in this proxy war? The USA supports chaos and continued civil war. As long as there is continued violence, the USA can delay other countries from developing lucrative infrastructure and oil fields in Libya. That way the USA can retain its hegemony. So the USA basically supports whichever side can keep the battle going on, which currently is their puppet Haftar.Russia favors playing the two off each other because it has inked economic contracts with both sides. As such Russia sent its Wagner group militia to fight on the side of Haftar. Moreover, as long as there is continued fighting, there will be more Libyan and Muslim refugees that will flee to Europe, create chaos in Europe, and allow further Russian exploitation in Europe\u2019s democracies, thereby weakening the EU and NATO.Turkey supports Sarraj, a fellow Turk, but also because Surraj\u2019s government promised maritime control in the East Mediterranean, which would allow Turkey more maneuverability in the region at a time when the EU and the USA are sanctioning it. Turkey also wants to move Al-Qaida and ISIS soldiers away from Syria and its own borders to Libya. This has made Greeks in Cyprus wary of Turkey, as well as other former states under the Ottoman empire suspicious of Turkish irredentism.France does not want any more Muslim refugees and wants peace. But it has been supplying weapons to Haftar. Why Haftar? Maybe because of US pressure and good deals with Haftar. The USA thinks: ok I won\u2019t supply weapons and violate the UN arms embargo, so I will let France supply US made weapons to Haftar instead. That way people can blame France, not the USA. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/07/libya-asks-france-explain-arms-reached-haftar-forces-190712001110293.htmlItaly has opposed France\u2019s and Turkey\u2019s involvement in Libyan affairs. Libya is close geographically to Italy, and recently Italy has been receiving a hundreds of thousands of refugees ever since Qaddafi was overthrown by the USA and NATO. It opposes foreign countries intervening in Libya. https://www.politico.eu/article/frances-double-game-in-libya-nato-un-khalifa-haftar/Most of Europe, including Britain and Germany, seems to recognize the GNA, the official UN government. https://www.euronews.com/2019/04/08/france-under-pressure-to-condemn-haftar-as-eu-seeks-unity-on-libya-crisisThe various Arab and North African nations seem divided about which side to support, with some like Egypt supporting Haftar while others like Qatar and Sudan support Sarraj.China wants to be neutral and stay out of the messy situation in Libya. It has refused to supply arms to either side. But Sarraj has agreed to join China\u2019s BRI to help redevelop Libya\u2019s economy. It is unclear whether there are similar infrastructure and oil deals between China and Haftar. But if there is anything China wants, it is peace in Libya and a multilateral peace conference. It opposes any unilateral outside influence that threatens to destabilize Libya even more.What is the best outcome? A peace deal to end the fighting, one that might actually end up splitting Libya between the Tripoli and LNA governments, like how Sudan was split in 2011. This way all there will be no more Libyan refugee crisis. And all countries can continue economic and oil deals with both governments, build critical infrastructure, and live peacefully. ",

            "answer_text": "Tribulations is more indispensable than oil in Libya, and it is at the crescendo of a full-fledged war. Libya is on the verge of an impending war. People of Libya went berserk when they heard of Libyan National Army (LNA) approaching Tripoli, Libya.  Source- Al-jazera Things you should know Civil war has been prevalent in Libya since Muammar Al Gathafi\u2019s death, thereby making it a country, which shares powers between two authorities with no collegiality.The powers are shared by Government Of National Accord (GNA), and Libyan National Army (LNA).GNA Operates from Tripoli, Libya. It is not only underpinned by USA and United Nations but also presided over by the Libyan Prime Minister, FAYEZ AL-SARRAJWhere as LNA, a rebel agglomeration is leaded by Libyan General,KHALIFA HAFTAR,it operates from Tobruk, Libya, and underpinned by Egypt and UAE. Khalifa Haftar should get kudos for the ongoing tribulations in Libya. Fayez Al-SarrajSource- Wikipedia He has commanded his army to advance on GNA to liberate Libya by muscling in Tripoli, so that this can wrought the annexation of Tripoli and Tobruk into a united Libya, and want to get at the helm of a unilaterally established authority of Libya. Source- Webtv This order was commanded, when the General Secretary of United Nations, Antino Guterres had been in Tripoli.History of Khalifa Haftar  Credits- The Gurdian If you want to understand the havoc created in Libya, then`we have to know a bit about him. In 1969, he aided Muammar Al Gathafi, did a coup in contemplation of untrammeled power. In 1978, he became prisoner of war during a war between Libya and Republic of Chad, which made Gathafi turn a blind eye to him. He was incarcerated by USA, worked for CIA for 20 years, involved in a lot of plannings of assassinations of Gathafi. After the sudden debacle of Gathafi in 2011, he abruptly came back to Libya, and started to agglomerate small tribal groups. In May 2014, he launched an operation entitled \u201cOperation Dignity\u201d to uproot Al-queda from Benghazi. He didn\u2019t embody the valour but also exemplified it. In 2015, Owning to his trounce over Al-queda made the house of representatives of Libya appoint him the General of LNA. In September 2016, After gaining control over LNA, he launched another operation entitled \u201cSwift Thunder\u201d, and grabbed back the hold of conglomerated oil terminals from the terrorists organizations. Today, he has the hold of behemoth chunks of Libya, and also zero terrorism policy against obscurantist Islamic terrorism. Differences Between GNA and LNA The gloves are off. The matter of alienation and estrangement between them is due to the intransigence of GNA to talk to the terrorists organizations in order to wrought them in mainstream, where as Khalifa Haftar says that there is no need of any deliberations, and just wants to decapitate these moths vehemently. Notwithstanding, the United Nations has thrived to get a detente between them, but didn\u2019t get the sought after results. Will Khalifa Haftar be able to get hold of Tripoli and how is it related to India? Well, we have to reckon that the maximum parts of Libya are controlled by him, today. So, it is apposite that he is deserving and powerful. His bewilderment against GNA was ostensibly seen, when the General Secretary had been present in Tripoli,Libya, and he commanded his commanders to encroach the capital city of Libya, Tripoli, because he wanted to send an unambiguous message that he is the bonafide proprietor of Libya . The peace keeping force of UN also comprised of Indian CRPFS man was made to relinquish their grounds. Even GNA, underpinned by UN and USA can defend and survive itself against the LNA, only for an ephemeral time. Haftar wants to insinuate a full fledged war. Let\u2019s see what happens next. Thank you. I appreciate your time. ",
