            "answer_text": "Slavery was the bedrock of the trade that made America a rich country. The first international cash crop in the U.S was rice, some of which was shipped to Europe, but many of the richest slaveowners owned land and slaves in the West Indies and were able to also grow sugar from which molasses was produced. Molasses was used to produce rum, a key triangle trade item. Other forced labor products were tobacco, indigo and then \u2014 drum-roll please \u2014 King Cotton. The textile industry kicked off the industrial revolution. At the base of the textile industry was slave-picked cotton. Early American trade wealth was a by-product of slavery. During the American Revolution, Britain attempted to block the U.S.\u2019s ability to trade their slave-produced goods, to starve them out. However, the U.S. was able to generate enough capital to fight the greatest naval power of the time. It is doubtful that the U.S. could have sustained that fight, or paid its debtors back after the Revolution without the wealth generated at its base by the slave trade. Slavery was so lucrative that, after successfully arguing that their slave states should have weight in the government in proportion to their wealth (slaveowners were the wealthiest men in the country), slaveowners were able to get one of their number elected in every presidential election up to Lincoln\u2019s election in 1860. Of the first twelve presidents of the United States, only the two Adams were not slave owners. Because Lincoln did not support slavery\u2019s expansion into non-slave states, the slave states attempted to secede from the United States. There would have been no civil war without slavery. Contemporary records speak of the need for slaves to create infrastructure, roads, bridges, train tracks, houses, etc. Before the Industrial Revolution reached momentum in the late 1800s, Europeans would never have come to the U.S. in the numbers they did without the infrastructure that had already been laid by slave labor. Without slavery, perhaps we would have the same population as Canada, 30 or 40 million. The thriving, vibrant country we call the United States might never have existed. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming that for every slave that was not brought in a European or African indentured servant was brought instead we would be much better off. Indentured servants were freed and given land after a few years of free labor to whoever paid for them to immigrate. The only positive thing about slavery is that it brought more people here. I don\u2019t think slavery contributed to the economy, (slaves had very low productivity). When slavery ended we had 3 million free-Hard working black people who certainly did contribute to the economy, which was a wonderful thing. It\u2019s too bad they couldn\u2019t have all come As indentured servants from Africa in 1865, but we don\u2019t have time-machines. ",
