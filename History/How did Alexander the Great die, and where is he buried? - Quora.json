            "answer_text": "In cases like this one, of great leaders, we can separate our quest in three categories. \u03b1) Tale(s): He didn't die. As for example the Arabic name suggests:\u201cthe one who lives\" (Yahya, \u0399\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2). Or the quest of these half human gorgeous gorgons ladies: \u201cZei ho Basileas Alexandros\u201d, are still asking the sailors, many centuries after4th bc century.Symbolic or real? Or remnants of that theory, centuries old one, because people just couldn't believe it. And not only the friends. But also the future enemies, with mathematical precision Rome: a piece of cake for him! \u03b2)Hypothesis(one\u2019s enough):  You see it,no? Check again. Scenario in your stereo (not 100% unreal):Sick and tired the soldiers, start spreading rumors & forbidden thoughts \u2018is this our King Alexandros?\u2019 Some they even insist that they heard him saying at a banquet the other day: \u2018I am feeling better with Hindous or with Pathanas!\u2019. They felt neglected. He did believe in different deities now. \u2018Even earlier\u2019said the other:\u2018do you remember that he kneeled before the Sanhredin?\u2019. Oh that's it. Mutiny is not so unthinkable anymore. The word came to A\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2. First things first:they bring to court,most gifted Babylonian specialists . Omens, Signs, Diosimeies were examined; verdict: \u2018\u03a9 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac, you have a strong enemy\u2019.Chief of the astrologists revealed that a bear appeared in his dream, declaring that way imminent and mortal danger\u2026 After long deliberations they announced that death by poison is the method of the killers and that\u2019s better to remain near Indus river area. Alexander dismissed case of mutiny of his soldiers and superstitions of Babylonians and went straight to lion's mouth, in order to die \u2018one hour earlier\u2019 (mia ora architera). Did he? And \u03b3) Reality: Unknown. Yes the one you know. He went to Palace, where he ate and drunk whatever they gave him and died in agony. T\u03c9 \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03c9 , to the best, he said and died. Not any explanation if he includes a non Hellenic person also. In the corner of the room of the death bed , a foreign Prince is standing. Is he real or a mirage? His name is in the above chart. No gap. Day by day replacement. Was, he that conquered the top of the word, so gullible although the signs and the advices, he that was so superstitious as one real Greek? ",

He was buried in Alexandria (the one in Egypt) and his tomb was a tourist attraction and shrine for a long time; think of an ancient Elvis. It has since been lost, and the search continues. ",
