            "answer_text": "In order to answer the question, \u201cwhy should anyone be nationalistic?\u201d and since it is not possible to give a separate answer for each country, I will emphasize in the fundamental idea of the nation that existed and came into being since the eighteenth century. The nation in the eighteenth century was said to be based upon the people themselves, on their general will, and was no longer symbolized solely by allegiance to established royal dynasties. The worship of the people thus became the worship of the nation, and the new politics sought to express this unity through the creation of a political style which became, in reality, a secularized religion. The idea of the nation had quasi-religious undertones: since a nation has no visible physical presence, it has to be believed in. Nationalism is the secular faith of the industrial age. The new state was not sanctioned by god, but by the nation. The fact that nationalism is considered as the secular religion of the industrial age can help us understand why a person becomes nationalist. The people are just the true believers of this secular religion, and similar to what is happening with every religion. People during that time were unorganized masses, a chaotic crowd in search of the longing for a healthy and happy world, and for a true community exemplified by the aesthetics of politics in which all could join. Moreover, the driving force that led the vast majority of the people to embrace the nationalistic ideas is and was the desire for permanence and fixed reference points in a changing world. In order to offer these fixed points of reference the founders of nationalism attributed a paramount importance to the reconstruction of the historical consciousness of the nation and to the achievements of its language, art, and literature. Beside the factor already noted the right to possess their own and peculiar literature,the consecration of their maternal language and the conviction that the respective people have their special missions in the history of the world attributed to them by fate. Obviously, human beings are living organizations that have their own will and the proper mentality that will help them to choose always what is best for them. Therefore, we must not underestimate the fact that many people are willing to identify, and thus be politically united, only with people who share with them the same culture. I believe that the aspiration to belong to a culturally, economically and even politically strong nation is an inherent characteristic of every person. Hence, we can say that nationalism is a secular religion and, a person becomes a nationalist because by worshipping its own culture, it is like worshipping itself. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure what you mean by nationalistic. Let me say that you should be nationalistic when your interest is aligned with the national interest. That would be clear in the case of a defensive war; it\u2019s not so clear in the case of an offensive war. One factor is that you are born with citizenship in one nation, and that\u2019s hard to change. It follows that your personal interest depends more on the policies of that nation than on those of any other nation. Benefiting from the policies of that nation demands loyalty to it. That kind of nationalism does not necessarily mean rejecting immigrants from other nations. That would depend on how the immigrants affect your personal interest. (Not on how some politician says they do, but how they really do.) ",
