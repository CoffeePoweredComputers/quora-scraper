            "answer_text": "I will divide the answer into two parts. 1. Who are brahmins? Brahmins originally were the persons officiating in religious rites and those who were well versed in Vedas as that knowledge had been handed down to them from their forefathers. Sometimes, the term was used so loosely in literature that any holy man could have been called a brahmin by default. Gradually, it became an identity for a person belonging to a caste. Today, most of the brahmins who are identified as belonging to the brahmin caste do not know the scriptures nor conduct any religious functions but are simply designated so. 2. The answer to \u201c how did they come to Tamilnadu?\u201d is fraught with danger as some politicians have spread the view that the brahmins came from north India. Tamilnadu brahmins have more in common with other Tamils than with a UP brahmin or with a Bengali brahmin. Their physical features are similar to other Tamils. They eat almost the same dishes like other Tamils except that they are vegetarians. Most speak Tamil at home though with a different accent. So, it does not stand to reason that these people came from outside Tamilnadu. Tamilnadu was never an island and migration was taking place all along. Various people moved into the present day Tamilnadu when moghuls took their property and land or when some famine struck. Some brahmins might have come into Tamilnadu from Maharashtra, Karnataka or Andhra Pradesh due to these reasons. But their number is insignificant. Most of the brahmins seem to have been in Tamilnadu atleast for the last thousand years. Cholas have had officials who were brahmins in their courts and seemed to have donated lands to them. Brahmins are not a very homogenous community. Some are very rich landlords and some are poor cooks. Some are well educated. Some are not. How could the difference be so much had they all come at a particular point of time ? So,the variation within the group of people who are branded as brahmins defies the nicely formulated and packed idea that these people came ftom north. They are Tamils just like Pillais and chettiyars and Gounders and Nayudus. It is better to stop searching for a date if their arrival as one would never find it. ",

            "answer_text": "Brahmins in Tamilnadu can be classified into two categories: 1. Brahmins of Aryan Origin and settled in Tamilnadu 2. Brahmins(Paarppaar or Antanar) of Tamil Origin and natives of Tamilnadu. The very word \u2018Brahmin\u2019 is alien to India. The Aryan tribal vagabonds (so called Vedic Aryans) who entered Indian sub-continent did not have a written form (orthography) for their spoken language. Their numerical strength was not large enough to capture any country and over a period of time they moved to different parts of India including Tamilnadu. Their folk-traditional Vedic hyms were their oral literature that were preserved meticulously. Depending on the place of their settlement, Vedic Aryans adopted the written orthography of the then Prakrit Indian Language prevalent in their vicinity. All Prakrit languages of ancient India shared a common orthography and structure of Tamil language, the oldest language of the world. In Tamilnadu, they have adopted Tamil orthography directly and developed their first written orthography for Vedic Language called Granta Lipi Granta Aksharas. As the Vedic language written scripts varied widely across India, several variations crept in the composed Vedas. In order to standardize them, the sage Badarayana, popularly known as Ved Vyas, composed Rig Veda from the various dialects of Vedas documented in different parts of India. Sanskrit was later evolved as a perfected version, by adopting the Vyakranas of Astathyaayi, a vedic grammar system developed by Sage Panini, for a language known as \u2018Bhasha\u2019 that was prevalent then. The name Sanskrit was coined during the fourth century AD. The Aryan Brahmins schemed to capture the Political and social spaces in Tamilnadu, by intruding into the theology of Temple worship rituals systematically. They adopted both the Shiva Linga idol worship and Thirumal (later mapped to Vishnu by Vedic Aryans) idol worship culture of Tamils. They developed Sthala-Punanas (temple history) for various Siva and Thirumal, Murugan temples in Tamilnadu. The art of Temple Architecture, worship methods, temporal rituals and festivals, philosophy of God that were documented in Tamil Agamas were systematically translated into Granta Lipi and they destroyed the Tamil Agamas. Temple Architecture is very unique to Tamilnadu and is not prevalent outside Tamil Nadu. Aryans could spoil the languages and culture of rest of India except Tamil and Tamilnadu. In spite of their best efforts to destroy Tamil language, they failed miserably. ",
