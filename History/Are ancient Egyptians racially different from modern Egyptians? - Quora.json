Should you visit the Cairo museum and move from one Kingdom hall to another you will see the consistency of features and ethinicty of ancinet Egyptian as depicted from their arts through out history. The extreme majority of them will range from light tan skin hue in the North to dark Copper in the South. That has remained the case to our present day. The most direct decendents to the ancinet Egyptian are the Christain Egyptian commonly know as Copts ( thought Copt actually means Egyptian in old Arabic). They are the people who had retained their language, culture and religion ( they were Christianized indigenously) and never adopted Greek, Latin language or Chalcedon Christain of their Romans imperial power or the Islam the religion of the Arab cconquerers. Because of that they discourage iintermarrying to the extend that the Coptic Church does not recognize the marriage contract of any other institutions. Though, they are regarded as ethnoreligious group, they are not physically distinct from their fellow Muslim Egyptians, except for the latter having 8% subsaharan DNA then most Copts. All that plus the science of DNA and dental morphology which confirm this continuous ethinic consistency of modern Egyptian to the Ancinet ancesters. Just to make clear, Egypt is a transcontinental country with most land mass on the African continent and 1/3 of the land mass in Asia (Sinai Peninsula). It is closer geographically, historically and culturaly to the countries of the Middle East and North Africa then anywhere else in the world. It is seperated from Subsaharan African by ten of hundred of miles of uninhabitant desert and unnavigatable Nile river because of 3 Cataracts. Graph below; consistency of modern Egyptian to ancinet with a visible increase (8%) in Subsaharan DNA with the modern Egyptian (In red)   ",

            "answer_text": "Yes they are to a very large extent. I think it is very important we understand the origin of ancient Egypt first before we reach a conclusion on this. According to the prehistoric timeline of ancient Egypt the earliest settlements was located in Wadi-Halfa a region just below the Southern border of Egypt in Northern Sudan, along the Nile River in Lower Nubia. Prehistoric Egypt - Wikipedia  There was a Northward migration of people from Wadi-Halfa into Egypt during the prehistoric period. That is why all the major cultural technocomplexes from the Paleolithic period, Mesolithic period, Neolithic periods originated from Wadi-Halfa and extended Northwards into Egypt. That is the Khormusan culture, Halfan culture, Qadan culture and Sebelian culture.  That is also why the Badarian, Tasian, Naqada and A-Group cultures are strongly related to the Nubian Neolithic traditions. In the Predynastic period, the Egyptian and Nubian identities still shared many common traits derived from a common ancestry. The Naqada culture developed from the Badarian culture which, as the Tasian, was related to the Nubian Neolithic tradition (Gatto 2002; 2006c). https://www.google.com/url?cshid=1566515305856&rct=j&sa=t&source=web&url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Gatto.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2_933dfhBCzp8eBpvUClZM&ved=2ahUKEwjliMegzJfkAhXSl-AKHbW7CycQFjAFegQIBhAB So, archaeologically Egyptians and Nubians originated from a common ancestry. These people shared several cultural values that originated from Sudan, these people were both indigenous to the Nile Valley. During the Pre-Greek era of ancient Egypt. The common conception of ancient Egyptians and Nubians (Ethiopians) by European scholars were dark/black people. An example is Aristotle\u2026.  Ancient Egyptians also depicted Nubians sometimes as brown just like them.   Ancient Egyptians depicted people from Levant or West Asia quite differently\u2026.  Today most of the people in Egypt, especially in the North appear like the Hyksos/Levant/West Asian or like the Libyans\u2026  But if you go to Southern Egypt, many modern day Egyptians still appear brown skinned as depicted during the ancient period. Earlier DNA done on Royal mummies during the New kingdom clearly states the difference in genetics. Ramses III and his son Pentewar were both E1B1A Ydna haplotype which is different today from most people in Northern Egypt. Revisiting the harem conspiracy and death of Ramesses III: anthropological, forensic, radiological, and genetic study The reason why modern day Egyptians appear different from the ancient Egyptians is because ancient Egypt was occupied and conquered by several foreign societies. The Libyans, Hyksos, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Turks, Arabs\u2026. All these foreign people occupied and ruled Egypt for over 1,900 years. Their descendants altered the demography of ancient Egypt, influencing a melting pot of races and culture. Today Egypt is an Arabic country. ",

The concept of \u201crace\u201d, as the term is used today, is scientifically discredited. So the question, strictly speaking, has no meaning. What is true is that Egyptians are more descended from the ancients peoples of North Africa than from other groups, though not exclusively. You find this pattern in most regions of the Old World, but not as much in the New World, especially North America. ",
