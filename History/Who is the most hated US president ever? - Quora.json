            "answer_text": "Thanks for asking this question. I am a history geek, and I love discussions like these. The most hated presidents are the presidents that Caused a war or lead to wars.Ignored the constitution and were impeached.With these in mind, we look at the history and list a few of the most hated presidents. Which is hated more is hard to say, but all are considered bad presidents James Buchanan, Jr., a Democrat, was the 15th President of the United States, and held this prestigious post from 1857 to 1861. His mandate began just before the onset of the American Civil War. Before taking the top job Buchanan had accumulated plenty of political experience after serving in the House of Representatives and Senate. Buchanan had even held the post of Secretary of State under President Polk. Buchanan was born in Pennsylvania, but was regarded as having Southern sympathies. President Buchanan not only failed to broker peace between a divided nation, but also ended up alienating members of both warring factions. Many still blame President Buchanan and his ineffective presidency for failing to prevent the outbreak of the Civil War, with some even referring to the devastating national conflict as \u201cBuchanan\u2019s War\u201d.The 29th President of the US was Warren G. Harding, who held office from 1921 to 1923. Harding is regarded by a great many historians to be one of America\u2019s worst presidents. After his death stories of corruption and scandal became rampant. Aside from his actual political policies Hardy\u2019s personal life was marred by tawdry revelations of his extramarital affairs with numerous women including Nan Britton who even wrote a book which claimed that Hardy had fathered a daughter with her. In terms of issues related to governing the country President Harding ran into trouble with his mishandling of the Teapot Dome oil reserves which also proved quite scandal-worthy for his administration. The political affair began when, under the President\u2019s authority, oil reserves in Wyoming destined to be used by the Navy were transferred to the Department of the Interior.After Abraham Lincoln\u2019s assassination his Vice President, Andrew Johnson, was sworn in as the 17th head of state. Johnson, a native of Raleigh, North Carolina, governed the country from 1865 to 1869. Due to a violation of the Tenure of Office Act the President was impeached in 1868. After a quick acquittal by the Senate, however, Johnson was able to remain in office. Because Andrew Johnson was elected after the beginning of the Civil War issues related to the Reconstruction of the South and national unity came to the forefront of national politics not only in terms of Johnson\u2019s administration but for the entire country as well. President Johnson was unpopular for opposing measures, such as the Fourteenth Amendment, which was aimed at affording ex slaves with US citizenship.The 14th President of the US was Franklin Pierce whose term as head of state ran from 1853 to 1857. Pierce\u2019s administration is widely considered to have been a failure which served as a leading reason for the political decline of the Democratic Party. President Pierce also provided the perfect environment in which to foster the growing Southern secession movement. Like Fillmore, his predecessor, President Pierce upheld the controversial Fugitive Slave Act. In another unpopular action Piece\u2019s administration was responsible for passing the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act which led to the so called \u201cBleeding Kansas\u201d or Border War which was waged between anti and pro-slavery factions. This particular act is also considered as being one of the key events that lead up to the widespread death and destruction caused by the ravages of the Civil War.The 18th President of the US was Republican Ulysses S. Grant who served as the head of state from 1869 to 1877. As a General in the military Grant had played a major role in the Union army\u2019s victory over the Confederacy\u2019s forces during the American Civil War. President Grant\u2019s accomplishments during his two terms in office include overseeing Reconstruction in the southern states, dismantling the Confederacy, as well as supporting civil rights for black citizens. Perhaps the most significant cause of Grant\u2019s downfall and reputation as a poor leader are due to the many allegations of corruption and financial misconduct which plagued his administration. Another major failure of Grant\u2019s career occurred during the 1876 Battle of Little Bighorn when US General Custer was killed by warriors from the Sioux tribe.Millard Fillmore was the final Whig member to hold the office of US President. Fillmore served in the role as the nation\u2019s 13th President from 1850 to 1853. A former lawyer, Fillmore began his career in politics in 1829 as a member of the state legislature. Initially the representative from New York was elected as Vice President but assumed the top job when President Zachary Taylor died in 1850. Slavery was a major issue during this period in US history and Fillmore was well known as a supporter of the Compromise of 1850. As President Fillmore endorsed a particularly controversial portion of this policy known as the Fugitive Slave Act which was aimed at settling disputes between Southern slave owners and abolitionists in the North. This act, formerly entitled, \u201cAn Act respecting Fugitives from Justice, and Persons escaping from the Service of their Masters\u201d stated that if caught all escaped slaves were to be returned to their masters. He was hated by democrats who shelter runaway slaves and helped slaves to flee to canada.George W. Bush was the 43rd President of the US and served from 2001 until 2009. His father is former President George H.W. Bush (1989 to 1993) and brother Jeb, a former Governor of Florida who recently lost his bid to become the 2016 Republican Presidential candidate. The 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon occurred less than a year into Bush\u2019s presidency. Although he'd achieved a high approval rating just after the tragedy Bush's popularity would never recover after he made the controversial decision to order US military action in Afghanistan as well as Iraq. President Bush will also be remembered for his assertion that Iraq leader Saddam Hussein possessed \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d, a claim that was later found to be false. During his presidency Bush also faced criticism for his mishandling of Hurricane Katrina as well as the financial crisis of 2008.As we can see from the above examples of president that was hated, almost all of them were hated for division of US leading to civil war, corruption and opposition to US constitution. Therefore, I like to point out one of the leading contestants for most hated president in modern times is president Donald Trump. Why? No modern presidents since 1970s has dropped below 50% approval rating in less than one year. He achieved this feat in just 8 days. Learning from history, all modern presidents since 1970s have release their tax returns, even though it is not required to do so. The reason they do this is to ensure transparency. He is the only president to refused to do so. All modern presidents that have businesses placed their business in a blind trust to avoid conflicts of interest. Again donald refused to do so. As we learnt from history, some of the worst and most hated presidents in history is due to massive corruption scandals. Presidents who abused their powers for their own gains. Donald is on the path to be a leading contender for most hated president in this regards. Already, within days into his presidency, he is being sued under the emoluments clause, alleging him profiting from foreign organisations. He trusted Russia over the CIA, men who bleed and died to deliver intelligence for the betterment of USA. Many of his appointees have ties to Russia. Donald is also unaware of our constitution, and like all lousy and hated presidents before him, sought to create divides among Americans. Almost all presidents in modern times have sought to heal the divide among conservatives and liberals after the election. Instead he widen the divide. He has discriminated against latinos, women, muslims and the handicapped. It is divides like this that led to the civil war, and led to some of the most hated or worst presidents in the history of USA. That is why history greeks like myself are alarmed and appalled by Donald. His rise to power is chilling similar to Hitler\u2019s rise to power.  He has been in power for only 11 days as of the time my writing this. But already so many protests have taken place, not just in USA but also around the world. There were protests in UK, france, and even in far away countries like Australia. Protesters protest his treatment of women in day 2 and turned up in droves in day 9 to protest against muslim ban, revealing him to be one of the most hated US president GLOBALLY. There was less resistance for Dubya Bush than him, and Dubya Bush was considered one of the most hated president in modern times - until Trump. Dubya Bush was only hated after 2 to 3 years in his presidency. Trump achieve this feat in just 8 days! Right now he has just achieved power. I pray that I am mistaken in my belief that he was leading America to ruins. After all, I am American and I want the best for my country. But if history is any indication, things are not looking good for Trump. It is my personal belief that this man does not like to read and reflect, has not learnt from history and will repeat the same mistakes of the worst presidents before him. ",

            "answer_text": "Lincoln. If not hated, at least extremely disliked by millions of southerners, as well as a fair number of northerners. Many of his actions, it turned out, were unconstitutional, such as suspension of the writ of habeus corpus. In addition, Prior to his political career, he had been a lawyer for the railroads- condemning right of way land for the railroads across farms whose owners would not sell. I am not casting aspersions at that, but it made a lot of people in Illinois hate him. The Morrill Tariff Prior to the beginning of Secession, but after his election, One of the things that made many southerners hate him was his insistence that as Predident he would enforce the Morrill Tariff Act of 1860. Congressman Morrill was from Massachusetts . Many Southerners saw this tariff as a declaration of economic war on the agrarian South by the urban manufacturing North. The tariff made imports from England 25% more expensive. Southern ships hauled cotton to England for their clothing mills; On the return voyage, those ships brought to Savannah, Charleston, Mobile , New Orleans and Galveston English manufactured goods. England was the source of shirts and pants and dresses and fine furniture, household glassware and crystal, dishes, fine silver, gunpowder , percussion caps and writing paper , coffee and tea, Common and high end sporting arms, books, rope and cordage, candles, lamp oil, fancy soap, cutlery , matches and other household items. A tariff added 25% to the cost of these items affecting every southern household. If the items became too expensive to sell, southern ships must make the return run home empty or at least less full. The tariff was seen as a blatant attempt to force Southern cotton growers to sell cotton at lower prices to US manufacturers such as the clothing mills of Lowell Massachusetts. And the tariff- the money went into the Federal Treasury to build post roads and canals and public improvements in \u2026 Drum roll\u2026 the North. Guess what-southerners resented the Morrill Tariff, viewing it as Federal theft voted in by the Northern states to protect their industry and damage the South. Was it? It's hard to tell , but Lincoln campaigned in support of the Tarriff and told a delegation of southerners that as President he would enforce the tariff and collect the money. That certainly increased the animus. I do not like him either - when Texas voted to secede, he telegraphed Governor Sam Houston that Houston need only ask and Lincoln would send 15,000 Federal troops to \u201c\"hold Texas in the Union\u201d. Houston declined the offer. Yup, that was Honest Abe. He proposed to overturn an election result at the point of a Yankee bayonet. For all these reasons- I think he's likely the most hated. Close second? Woodrow Wilson. ",
