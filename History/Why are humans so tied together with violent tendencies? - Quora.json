            "answer_text": "It goes back to insecurity and ego. A person with violent tendencies have identity issues and use violence as a means of getting recognition, respect, or power over others. A person waving a gun around someone's face and threatening them is demanding recognition and respect because they are either emotionally frustrated or sexually frustrated. A fragile ego and deep insecurity is the key link to violence and other disgusting human behavior. Notice how most dictators are men.. they then have feud with other men.. it's a power struggle. Domestic violence and abuse among women is a huge problem in America.. at least 3 women die everyday from domestic abuse from a partner. Again, this goes back to insecurity as the man most likely feel his manhood is being challenged or threatened, and he does not have a strong identity as a man so he takes out his frustrations on his wife or partner. This is known as toxic masculinity which translates to male insecurity. So insecurity is the worst and ugliest thing because it makes humans do the ugliest things. Also look up \"the Stanford experiments\".. it proves that when people get power or authority over others, they almost will always abuse it and they find it amusing and entertaining as it feeds their ego from having power over others. \u201cIncels\u201d are essentially sexually frustrated men who are extremely insecurities and low self esteem.. so much to the point of self destruction and harming others in order to gain attention or respect. The Parkland mass shooter carried out his domestic terrorist attack on Valentine's day because the days before he was rejected by a girl that he was trying to talk to. Neo Nazis blame Jews for their problems in life, they are jealous that they don't have the same success as them and think they're going to be \u201creplaced\u201d by them. Again, it goes back to insecurity and low self-esteem. ",

            "answer_text": "Human males are significantly larger and stronger than Human Females. In Nature this sort of sexual dimorphism means only one thing. Males are evolved to compete and fight one another for breeding rights. The remarkable thing about modern societies isn't actually how violent they are, it is actually how non-violent they are. ",
