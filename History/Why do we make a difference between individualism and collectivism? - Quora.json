            "answer_text": "This is a n old Quora question, and I\u2019m giving it an answer to bump it. In theory, individualism and collectivism are very clearly defined opposites. The greater good of \u201cthe people\u201d versus the self-interest of \u201cthe person\u201d. Collectivists are dependent on the group, whereas individualists are dependent upon themselves. Collectivists gain identity from the group, whereas individualists make their own distinct identity, often seemingly at odds with the group. In theory, individualism should show itself in an indefinite variety of unique ways, seeing as how each person ever born has the theoretical potential to be a novel personality with original thoughts and ideas. In the previous century, modern global mass media was in its infancy, and even towards the end of the century, there was still a significant lag in the time it took information to travel from one side of the country to another. Therefore, communities remained more isolated, access to new ideas was more limited, and many people just never knew how many \u201cindividuals\u201d with \u201cnovel\u201d ideas and \u201cunique\u201d personalities were out there. We saw the superstar on MTV, and we thought \u201cWow, look how new and revolutionary this person is! They must be some sort of special kind of genius!\u201d. We were lucky enough to finally get a copy of a Terrence Mckenna or Robert Anton Wilson book at our library, and we thought \u201cAmazing! I\u2019ve never heard of these brand new ideas about reality before! These men must be the most expanded-minded people to ever exist!!\u201d Back then, when we looked around us, we saw the stagnating remains of what we viewed as old-guard puritanical 1950s traditionalism, and among the ruins, these very bright, charismatic, idealistic, and edgy people with seemingly revolutionary things to say, climbing to the top of the pile and saying \u201cLook! This is new! This is original! This is how to find yourself and be your own genuine, unique, true self!\u201d, and we were so starved for something meaningful, but we didn\u2019t really know what to look for. So, we see these vivid shining ones dazzling us from out of a grayscale background, and we think to ourselves \u201cThat must be it! That must be what we\u2019re looking for!\u201d and we all bought it because it was something which seemed new, and just like newborn baby, we found meaning in it because it gave us more room to explore ourselves and our world\u2026 and for a time, it was all very exciting. The counter-cultures of the last century were absolutely convinced that they were the final revolution that would free the brainwashed masses from their orthodox collectivist mind prisons. Fast forward to the establishment of high-speed internet, youtube, and an entire world of totally interconnected information libraries in the palm of your hand wherever you go\u2026 and we\u2019ve just about seen and heard it all, haven\u2019t we? A tattoo covered punk rocker with neon spiky hair, a death metal t-shirt, and ridiculously gauged earloop rings might have been utterly shocking, mind-bending, and revolutionary in the early 80s\u2026 but now? He\u2019s the guy serving you at your local you-name-it store. He\u2019s your dad. He\u2019s your uncle. He\u2019s the owner of a successful business. He drives a porsche and lives in the same neighborhood as the heart surgeon and the aerospace engineer. Heck\u2026 that guy gets more face-time on CNN than the Baptist preacher\u2026 and to boot, now the \u201cfreaks\u201d are those backward Bible-believers who stick to the old tradition of their forefathers. There\u2019s not much left for an individual to claim as his own, and there\u2019s not very many individuals left who can\u2019t be quite fairly lumped into a thousand different sub-genres seamlessly woven into the overal socio-politico-corporate zeitgeist of collective humanistic progressivism. All seemingly new looks, sounds, ideas, worldviews, philosophies, political ideologies, even religions\u2026 we have begun to realize, due to the vast amount of information now available to us to cross-examine and compare, that all trends, ideas, stories, worldviews, and even musical genres\u2026 all of that variety can be grouped into just a few basic over-arching themes. And individual self-interest? It\u2019s all catered to by just a handful of corporations, which are funded and owned by an even smaller handful of global banks, which are overseen by just a couple of individual familes. All of our revolutions and novel ideas which sent the world spinning off its axis have been staged beforehand, and no event in history is completely unprecedented. We now know that everything we thought was new is actually very old. Every thought we thought was our own has actually been thought by hundreds of thousands of people even presently, and was probably contemplated by millions more throughout history. All trends are re-hashes of old trends. All music is just a reformed and regurgitated version of an older style. and even the darkest black metal has been done before by classical composers, and all music ever written is merely different combinations of just twelve musical notes arranged according to only a handful of different scales, but most just major and minor scales, which are themselves actually just the same scale pattern. In truth, there is no \u201cindividual\u201d. I\u2019m not saying there is no self, and I\u2019m not saying that there is only the collective, or that the collective is self. What I am saying is that the self is contingent upon many things which have come before it and many things which surround it and facilitate its being. Individualism is an unnatural fetishization of what is essentially a collective caricature of what the self is ideally supposed to be. Therefore, it should not come as a surprise that this inherently and ironically collectivist idealization of the notion of \u201cself\u201d in individualism always turns out, in the end, to resemble the collectivism its supposedly opposing. Likewise, collectivism fetishizes the collective by dogmatizing personality to fit into cookie-cutter frames to mirror one over-arching false image of what \u201cthe people\u201d look and act like, even though any actual collective never works that way, never looks that way, never acts that way. Our own bodies don\u2019t work that way. Nature doesn\u2019t work that way. Why would a society work that way, either? Of course there\u2019s a true collective. The world, the billions of people in it, the cosmos, and everything which exists\u2026 all of it is united as a whole, but it\u2019s not all the same thing, and it\u2019s not made of a bunch of unrelated things. Yet I can\u2019t quite say what it is. I can\u2019t quite intellectualize what might be a happy medium between two false extremes, because to me, the whole spectrum of our ability to form our perceptions and ideas into communicable patterns and then form plans off those second-hand translations of those artificial patterns\u2026 seems to be fundamentally unable in ad of ourselves to truly define the essence of self vs other\u2026 But that truly is the catch 22 of the world. Is truth to be found is self or in another? In the individual or in the whole? Even as a collective species, can we define what we all mean? Even if there were trillions of intelligent species out there in the universe, all interconnected and co-operating to find that middle ground upon which truth must surely be resting, can the entirety of creation in and of itself truly know what it is by itself? Or is there another? Is it a self or is it a collective? Is it God or is it Nature? Is nature God? Is God beyond nature? Or is it all actually nothing, and the reason this impossible dilemma exists because it\u2019s all actually absurd? All of this from collectivism vs individualism? You tell me. I usually forget what I said after I say it. What were we talking about again? ",

            "answer_text": "Good question\u2026 it seems to me that there is a balance. Of course we are all individuals, and yet of course we are all part of a \u201ccollective\u201d- society. Even 2 ranchers a hundred years ago that talked and decide not to let their animals pollute the stream they drink out of created \u201cregulations\u201d- so to speak. They became a \u201ccollective\u201d. All of life does this, they interact and live based on others. The idea that one can live totally as an individual, and \u201cI don\u2019t care what anyone thinks\u201d is simply a gateway to misery\u2026 and that ignorance as to the way all of life works, while sad, cant be worried about by society as a whole: some people, for one reason or another, choose not to fit in\u2026 its OK\u2026 let them.
