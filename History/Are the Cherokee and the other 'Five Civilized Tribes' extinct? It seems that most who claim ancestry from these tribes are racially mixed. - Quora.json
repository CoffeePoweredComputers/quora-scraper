            "answer_text": "The Five Tribes are the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole nations. They all come from the American Southeast. Having met and spoken with members of four of the Five Tribes, I can assure you that they are not extinct, and they are in no more danger of dying out than any other distinctive cultural group in the United States. If we are tempted to think otherwise, it is only because of our own tradition of assuming that the American Indians in general are a \u201cdying race.\u201d This says more about us Wvcenv (\u201cVirginians,\u201d Anglo-Americans) than it does about the original Americans. As for their being \u201cracially mixed,\u201d their so-called racial purity is a concern introduced by white people and our racial pseudo-science. It is closely related to our historic obsession with skin color as a criterion for sorting human beings into superior and inferior categories. Indian tribes didn\u2019t worry about such things. Belonging to a tribe was like belonging to a family; you could be born, adopted, or married in, with the community\u2019s consent. The concept of blood quantum \u2014 of being, for example, seven-eighths Cherokee and one-eighth white \u2014 is a racist conceit that was imposed on the tribes by the federal government. Initially it was a measure of presumed inferiority: The higher the quantity of \u201cIndian blood,\u201d the lower the individual\u2019s presumed capacity for intellect, self-control, and \u201ccivilization.\u201d We no longer endorse such 18th-century doctrines as phrenology, animal magnetism, and the caloric theory, but many of us still have trouble shedding belief in race and in white supremacy. The idea of a \u201cfull-blood\u201d Indian is an artificial construct as well, as all tribes practiced exogamy (marrying outside the group), whether they merely tolerated it or actively encouraged it. There were no \u201cuncontacted\u201d tribes in the United States in 1800, and all the Indian communities contacted by Lewis and Clark\u2019s \u201cCorps of Discovery\u201d (1804\u201306) already had a history of contact with white people. Two members of the Corps were already married to Indian (Dakota and Shoshone) women from the region being \u201cdiscovered.\u201d The children of these men were \u201chalf-breeds\u201d or \u201cmixed-bloods\u201d to Americans, and \u201cm\u00e9tis\u201d to French-speaking Canadians, but to their Native relatives they were Dakota or Shoshone, period. Some tribal governments have rejected blood quantum as a standard for membership, but most retain it \u2014 partly as a means to exclude culturally white people who claim to be entitled to tribal membership by virtue of \u201cblood\u201d alone. Now that Native American identity is seen as an honor rather than a stigma, some whites strive to acquire it as assiduously as their ancestors strove to acquire Indian land. Besides, many white people imagine that tribal membership is always accompanied by a financial windfall, or else they hope to receive earmarked college scholarship money. In my experience, they seldom demonstrate any interest in \u201ctheir\u201d tribe except as a source of valuable assets and historical curiosities. It seldom occurs to them that they might have an obligation to future generations. By the way, all five of the tribes mentioned in this question have rejected the patronizing label of \u201cCivilized,\u201d which implies that their fellow Native Americans are uncivilized. They simply call themselves the Five Tribes, with the understanding that this means the five southeastern nations that were subjected to forced removal ca. 1832\u20131850. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Absolutely not. The Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek (Muscogee), and Seminole are not \u201cextinct\u201d. I can tell you don\u2019t realize it, but what you are implying about \u201cracially mixed\u201d is racist pseudo-science nonsense. They are in no danger of going extinct. They have vibrant and growing cultures. You can go and meet these people. They are real. Membership in a tribe is determined by the tribal government laws. Just like citizenship in the UK, Germany, or Ireland, or the US. Each federally recognized tribe has an elected government. They set up the rules. Some require direct descent from a tribal member about 100 years ago in 1907. Some require that you have at least one parent or grandparent who was a tribal member. There are many different standards. This is not really any different than the way different countries have different standards. In Germany, for many years people whose families had moved to Russia in the time of Catherine the Great could move \u201cback\u201d and become citizens. If one of your grandparents was an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland, but neither of your parents was born in Ireland, you may become an Irish citizen. In Spain, if your mother or father was Spanish or if a grandparent was exiled, you can become Spanish. Those people who choose to do that are \u201creally Irish\u201d or whatever. It does not matter what \u201crace\u201d some of your relatives are. The Prime Minster of Ireland, Leo Eric Varadkar, has a father born in India. He was born in Ireland and raised Hindu and Catholic. He is \u201creally\u201d Irish. Having mixed heritage does not mean he is less Irish. The same goes for Winston Churchill who had an American mother. Or, sadly it is true, Trump. His mother was born and raised in Scotland and his father was conceived in Germany. Being part of an ethnic group or citizen or enrolled tribal member is in part about rules the group has but also about culture. It is not often about race. The Cherokee or Choctaw cultures have been in continuous existence. They did not \u201cdie out\u201d. Like all living cultures they are not preserved in aspic, but undergo continual change. But there is continuity. Members are \u201creally\u201d tribal members. The culture is not \u201cextinct\u201d. If someone has a white American grandfather but is raised as part of the community, they are truly Choctaw (or other tribe). The \u201cFive Tribes\u201d have in common with each other that most of them were forced out of homelands east of the Mississippi and had to move to Oklahoma. Today there are three federally recognized Cherokee tribal governments. They are The Eastern Band in North Carolina. They have about 12,000 enrolled members. Home - Eastern Band of Cherokee .

There are likewise members of the other tribes around the country in various places. Despite concerted efforts to wipe them out, these tribes survive. Indeed, the Cherokee and Choctaw are respectively the largest and third largest federally recognized tribes. It is certainly the case that there are a great many people in those tribes who don\u2019t have pure native ancestry, and there are still more people who claim ancestry in those tribes, particularly the Cherokee, who don\u2019t seem particularly native at all. The former, certainly, is not surprising. Mixed heritage is pretty common among modern native Americans, with something like half of tribal members having some kind of non-native ancestry. The Cherokee and Seminoles in particular took a good number of outsiders into their tribes. Having close association with Cherokee is often a source of family myths that they have \u201cCherokee blood,\u201d when at most their entirely non-native families might have been legally inducted into the tribe without any actual intermarriage taking place.

You may have to travel a ways to find a 100% full-blooded example, as those tribes have intermarried extensively with \u201cEuropean\u201d stock. That does not mean they are extinct. Tribes establish their criterion for membership one of two ways, and each way has benefits and drawbacks. Blood quantum or percent Indian blood is used by some tribes to define qualification by ancestry in relation to tribal membership. laws. Blood quantum is based on laws were developed by Europeans and thus did not necessarily reflect how American Indians had traditionally identified themselves or members of their tribe, and thus ignored the native practices of absorbing other peoples by adoption. Blood quantum also ignored tribal cultural continuity and could eventually result in no one who can meet the criterion for tribal membership. Another means by which criterion fo tribal membership is set is lineal descent. In this method, members must be able to document descent from original enrollees listed on tribal rolls. This method does not guard the blood quantum of tribal members, so the tribe becomes less visibly Indian, over time. These tribes are now trying to hold onto their culture, for it is tribal culture that is at the center of a tribe. ",

As a whole, mixed natives are more common than full natives, at least in the U.S. In fact, it\u2019s similar in Australia. Half-aboriginal half-white people are more common than full aboriginal people. ",
