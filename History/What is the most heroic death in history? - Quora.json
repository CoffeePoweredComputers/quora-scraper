            "answer_text": "The Third Imam, Husayn Ibn \u2018Ali (as), is famiusely known as Sayyed Al-Shohada (the Master of the martyrs), among the Shia Muslim. He, his household and his companions were killed, but never accepted the abjection. He refused to obey an oppressive king, and was killed with his few soldiers (72 men), against the thousands men, by the most violence, and taught us the lesson of freedom and bravery. Morning appeared and before Sunrise \u2018Ali Akber gave the Azan and all of them completed their morning prayers behind their Imam. Imam made his brother Abbas as the flag bearer of the tiny army of 70 persons in all when all of a sudden two more soldiers defected from Yazid\u2019s army. One was Hur who was the leader of the contingent who brought the Imam\u2019s party to Karbala\u2019 and also his son. Both of them arrived with their hands tied to apologize to the Imam for what they had done and asked his permission to fight for them and become first martyrs. Imam did not give orders to commence fighting until arrows came from the enemy camp. Then Hur went out to fight. Overwhelmed by the numbers on the other side, he soon died. His son went and he also died. Then one by one each companion of the Imam went and died until Zohr time when Saeed ibn Abullah al Bijilly came forward and informed the Imam that it was prayer time for Zohr. Battle was raging, arrows were coming towards the Imam\u2019s camp, how could they have formed lines for prayers. But they stood in single foil to perform their last prayers while two companions of the Imam Saeed and Zohair stood in front of this line to hold back all the arrows that were coming towards them. Once the Imam finished the last words of the prayers these two soldiers died of exhaustion. The Last of the companions of the Imam died and only the relatives remained. First to go was Imam\u2019s son \u2018Ali Akber who fought bravely but thirst for three days was the most important factor in the fall of these martyrs. He was also killed and then Imam\u2019s nephew Qasim went and was killed. Then four of his brothers, Osman, Jafar, Abullah and Abbas were killed. Imam then brought his 6 month old son \u2018Ali Asgher. He brought him in his arms under the shade of his cloak. He told the audience, \"this baby has not done any harm to you. He is thirsty, give him some water.\" The Commander of Yazid\u2019s army ordered Hurmula who was the best marksman to kill the baby. Hurmula pulled the bow and the arrow killed the baby instantly. Imam brought the baby near the camp, informed his mother of the martyrdom of the baby. He then buried the baby in the sand. Afterwards Imam himself went for battle. But before that he introduced himself again that he was the grandson of the Prophet in case anyone had any doubts about him and that his guilt was only to refuse to accept the Oath of allegiance of the Tyrannical ruler Yazid. The enemy was thirsty for the blood of the Imam, they were blind in their eagerness to kill the last of the family of the Prophet. They fell upon his injured and tired body like blood hounds and soon the Imam was also killed. The battle ended in one day. See: The Third Imam, Husayn Ibn \u2018Ali (as) Ashura ",
