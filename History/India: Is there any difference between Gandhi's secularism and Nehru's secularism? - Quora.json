            "answer_text": "Ekam Sat Vipra Bahudha Vadanti (That which exists is One: The Wise call it by various names) This is the Indian concept of secularism - that God is one and there are different paths to attain it (Sarva Dharma Samabhava - All approaches are equally valid). These core beliefs made India a land where all approaches to spirituality were welcomed. Ancient India welcomed the Jews while they were persecuted elsewhere. The ancient Jews had even established their own kingdom in Kerala. Parsees fled their native land on account of religious persecution and were welcomed in India. Christianity came to India long before it went to Europe. Islam came to India during the Prophet\u2019s lifetime. (There is a mosque in Ghogha, Gujarat which has its Qibla in the direction of Jerusalem which proves that Islam came during its nascent stage). To this day, Hindus can be found worshipping at dargahs of Muslim saints and wearing taweez (charms) given to them by Muslim fakeers. Hindus can also be found praying at the Basilica in Velankanni in Tamil Nadu.  Gandhian secularism was rooted in a deep understanding of Hinduism and a firm belief in the validity of all religions . Nehruvian secularism was based on western concepts and agnosticism which found resonance with the deracinated products of the Macaulayite assembly line, which rejected outright the Indic way of life as steeped in superstition and obscurantism. Gandhiji was not ashamed of his religion as Nehru was. Gandhiji was aware of the evils that had crept into the Indian way of life and sought to remove those evils while he remained true to the essentials of the Sanatana dharma. While Gandhiji wanted Hindus to be aware of the true nature of their religion and live according to its precepts, the anglophile Nehru wanted Hindus to become agnostics and atheists, the quintessential wog (westernized oriental gentleman) that he himself was. While Gandhian secularism was was based on accommodation, appeasement was the hallmark of the Nehruvian approach. The rise of right wing extremism is merely a reaction to the excesses of Nehruvian secularism. It is merely an aberration and will subside as India has always been secular. It cannot be anything but secular. ",

            "answer_text": "There are subtle but important differences between Gandhi's notion of secularism and Nehru's (and not Neharu) thoughts on the subject.  Gandhi did not necessarily understand secularism  as a divide between secular/political and sacred domains. Rather, he stressed upon the idea of value (Max Weber has similar concerns about the problem of value), particularly altruism, towards judging one's actions.  Nehru, on the other hand, gave more importance to the ideas growing out of the Enlightenment, such as rational inquiry and scientific temper . Historians have suggested that he wanted (though one can argue whether he could achieve the same or not) a complete divide between religion and politics. Economic inequality in the society for him was perhaps a more important issue than its religiosity which was more of a hindrance (though he did not reject religion outright . This led him to propagate the idea of religious pluralism even as the society, according to him, needed to ready itself  for secularism through secularization.  A good book to read on the subject is T N Madan's Modern Myths, Locked Minds: Secularism and Fundamentalism in India, OUP, 1998. ",
