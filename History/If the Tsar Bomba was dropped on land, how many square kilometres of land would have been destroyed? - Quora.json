            "answer_text": " This gives you an idea of the rough scale of destruction. However, I recall reading on Wikipedia that Tsar Bomba completely destroyed a village 55 km away, so I\u2019m not 100% sure why the figures don\u2019t tally. My only explanation is atmospheric refraction which is the atmosphere concentrating the blast. This happens all the time for nuclear detonations but computers don\u2019t simulate it. Atmospheric refraction can actually triple the destruction radius of a bomb given the right conditions. ",

Thermal radiation causing third degree burns would spread as far as Reading, Southend and Haywards Heath. Most residential buildings within the M25 would collapse and the majority of people in transport zone one of the capital would die from radiation exposure within a week. \ud83d\ude31  Source: The Independent, Katie Forster 2016 ",
