            "answer_text": "I'm not sure Trump is the most hated president in US history, but I would posit that he is actually the most hateable. He has shown himself to be immature, vindictive, irresponsible, racist, homophobic, sexist, narcissistic, untrustworthy, treasonous, contentious: need I go on? I believe, if he is able to serve all four years of his term, he will leave office the most hated president ever. His followers will eventually realize that he will not provide them with new well paying jobs. As they see him up close living the fine life and their lives get no better, they will finally get it. Once millions of people can not longer be covered by health insurance (either they have pre-existing conditions or conditions the insurance companies no longer have to cover) and their moms, dads and children die from lack of healthcare, he will strike nerves. He will divide us on ethnic, racial and religious lines more than we have been divided since the 1960s and 1970s. He will anger foreign leaders who have the nerve to stand up to his bully ways. The leaders who succumb to him will help him make the world a more dangerous place. At some point, even the most vicious, hateful, ignorant of his followers will hopefully pull their becks out of the sand. I believe (hope and expect) that he will not be able to serve his entire term. One of three things could happen, in declining likelihood. First possibility, he will be impeached. This man believes he can run the country as he has run his business (breaking agreements, bullying others, importing undocumented workers, having all his products made overseas, lying constantly about everything to try to make himself look better to others) rather than honoring contracts, respecting laws, and doing what he expects of others. Eventually, he will prove he is not competent to follow the constitution or the law and the real Republicans will get sick of defending him. McCain, Graham, men with morals. Second possibility, that he will quit. In less an a week he has been reportedly furious and bored by his staff. Instead of dealing with our country\u2019s needs, he makes wild gestures signing executive orders and then goes and watches television. He is angry at the press who finally is disproving his lies and doesn't understand how we aren't congratulating him for all he has already accomplished. How will he be able to handle the mass of negative opinion he is to be served in the future? He can't handle any personal negativity. He can't even handle use of unflattering photographs of him being used. (You think he will try to control his pictures too? I do.). I'm not sure his weak ego will be able to handle the stress of being a pariah. Third possibility, that he will anger the wrong person, group, militia or country and his safety will be compromised. The more countries, religions, ethnicities, states and cities he demeans and/or destroys, this possibility will become more probable. The Secret Service is the best money can train, but there will be a lot of angry well trained anti-Americans and anti-Trumps. Don't underestimate them. So yes, not today, but one day soon Trump will become the most hated president in US history. Update: It\u2019s is now August 1st, 2020, 2 1/2 years since I wrote this answer and Trump is still occupying the White House. Trump has continued to lie and cheat, degrade the presidency, embarrass the country abroad, insult our allies and befriend the most heinous governments on earth. He has withdrawn from international agreements on global warming band trade. He has withdrawn from the World Health Organization. He has tried to be a law and order, gonna take no prisoners, I\u2019m in charge of the country tough guy, but always fails and becomes a loathsome toddler whining about how unfair he has been treated. He has separated families at the Mexican border, thrown children into camps that wouldn\u2019t be suitable for animals, transferred children across the country without the consent of their parents. He has deported parents without their children. He has lost track of children in his hateful system, which children can never be reunited with their parents. He has created a generation of orphaned, neglected and abused children and teens who will never recover. Yes they were abused too, as the companies running there internment camps for children employed people who raped, abused and mistreated these children. How was Trump not impeached, removed, tried and imprisoned for all of that? I do know that it will make him the most hated American president ever. But that\u2019s not all! He conspired with the Russian to get elected and attempted to conspire with the Ukrainians to get re-elected. For the former he was investigated, but due to his corruption he was not impeached. He was impeached for the later, but his control of all but one Republican Senator, he wasn\u2019t removed from office. That Senator was Mitt Romney. Sadly, John McCain, who singularly stopped Trump from eliminating the Affordable Care Act has died. While during his life, his friend Lindsey Graham maintained a pretense of morality. Since he died, Graham has become a Trump apologist and supporter, to the degree he has repudiated any respect for the rule of law in our country. He has parroted every piece of anti American unconstitional nonsense Trump has used to justify his behavior. We are now in the grips of a pandemic Trump had every opportunity to minimize. Instead, he denied it and plundered every possibility to protect the American people. He failed at testing, test processing, data reporting and collection, acquisition of masks and other personal protection equipment, among other things. He lied about science, infection rates, cures, remedies, and the advice of medical experts. He shushed doctors trying to help. There are now 150,000 Americans dead, hundreds of thousand who have been ill and will carry organ damage with them the rest of their lives. Trump cared only about the impact the pandemic might have on his re-election than the health and safety of our neighbors. Even worse, through his lies, he convinces his most virulent supporters to believe his nonsense, causing more infection and more death. The pandemic has ruined the economy. While the stock market is being controlled for the benefit of the wealthiest among us, the gross domestic product for the last quarter fell 32.9%, the largest drop in history. There are 33 million people unemployed, increasing every week. Businesses are closing, including those that had been around for decades. The economic impact of the pandemic is worse than anything since the Great Depression. It will only get worse. There is so much more Trump has done to imperil our country, it would take a book to list his malfeasance, but this update is long and I am emotionally tired from having to relive what I have already written. It shocks me that Trump is still in office and that the once proud Republican Party is nominating him again as it\u2019s candidate. He is currently ranting about how this election will be corrupted by the liberals, who will use mail in voting to steal the election from him, poor thing. Although he doesn\u2019t have the power to do so, he is talking about delaying the election, or even making it sooner than Election Day. Anything to create diversion from the realities of his failed presidency and conflict. On November 3, 2020 the citizens of the United States will finally throw out the most hated president ever, Donald John Trump. ",

            "answer_text": "I would argue no. There are a few other presidents that would fit the bill quite snugly. Let\u2019s go in order: Andrew Jackson was openly racist towards the Native Americans and was the first imperialist president who abused his power. The Trail of Tears is his most notable event, in my opinion. According to historians, the most hated president is James Buchanan due to his inability to curb the Civil War, the single most divisive event in American history. Andrew Johnson was one of the worst presidents ever. Not only was he a sympathizer for slavery, but he actively tried to undo Lincoln\u2019s reconstruction. He was also the first president to have been impeached. He only remained president due to a single vote in the senate, acquitting him. Woodrow Wilson is despised for being racist (he showed the KKK\u2019s \u201cBirth of a Nation\u201d at the White House, for goodness sake). Supposedly, he was the first socialist-leaning president in American history. So, you can imagine why so many conservatives despise the man (most notable being Glenn Beck, who\u2019s catchphrase is \u201cI hate that guy\u2026\u201d whenever he mentions him). Franklin D. Roosevelt is despised by conservatives due to his massive expansion of government power. Most conservatives concede that he, along with the Allies, helped bring an end to the war. Truman decisively ended it, though, by dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki - an act that killed thousands, but saved millions. Richard M. Nixon is hated today due to the obvious Watergate scandal. That, and many Conservatives today look back at his legacy, and all we see is Progressivism. Really, the only thing that Americans despise is the fact that Trump is America\u2019s representative on the world stage. Conservatives who are anti-Trump wanted anyone else, honestly\u2026even another Bush like Jeb\u2026the Progressive-Leftists wanted Hillary Clinton - a criminal, if you ask methe Socialist-Marxist wing of the Democrats wanted Bernie Sanders",
