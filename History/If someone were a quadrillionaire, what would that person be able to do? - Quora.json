            "answer_text": "Well, in short, they would be the richest person by a factor of almost a million. The World GDP for 2017 was ~80 trillion. In comparison, that\u2019s only 8% of your incredible fortune. You could own entire countries; economies, and still have trillions of dollars left over. If you spent 1 trillion dollars every year, and continued spending until you hit 0$ left, it would take one thousand years. That means that you have enough money for at least five generations, or until your great great great grandson. Now, let\u2019s see what you can do with all this money. You could buy a few countries, maybe. Own thousands of businesses, and knock out all your competitors, if you happen to be an entrepreneur. There would be no one to stop you from doing illegal things, you could just pay the US government with an extremely bloated price. If you like space, then you could go and colonize the Moon, Mars, and maybe even build a Dyson Sphere. Want to be super? You could probably spend tens of trillions of dollars on cool gadgets, and even line them with gold if you wish. Bored? Buy a waterpark or two. As you can see, the amount of money one quadrillion dollars equates to basically means you can be whatever you want to. With riches comes fame, and the entire world would be trying to get to you in every way possible. You would be a household name, no matter what you did. Everyone would try to cater to your every whim, because you can execute them however you pleased. But that\u2019s all assuming that the price value of all money plummets into the center of the earth, of course. And assuming you won\u2019t just get murdered. ",

            "answer_text": "A quadrillion looks like this: 1,000,000,000,000,000. That is a 1 with 15 zeroes. That is also 1 billion sets of 1 million dollars. If you \u201csold off\u201d Earth and it's contents you would gross $5 quadrillion dollars. Your net worth is 20% of everything on planet Earth. You opinions sway stock markets and destroy companies. You could \u201cwaste\u201d a billion dollars a day and never not notice the impact on your wealth. You could buy almost any politician. You could own several countries or states in the US. You could own all the shipping in the world. Trains, planes, cars, trucks, and buses. It would take a small fraction of your fortune. You could buy Apple for a trillion dollars. That is only 1/1,000 of your fortune. You could buy the companies in the US. I did not mean choose some, I meant all of them. You could buy up ALL the personal debt, students loans, and medical debt. It would not scratch your fortune. You are the proverbial 800 pound gorilla. You can do anything you want. Best of luck. ",
