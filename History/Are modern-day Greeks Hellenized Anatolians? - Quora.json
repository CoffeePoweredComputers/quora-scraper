            "answer_text": "When you visit Athens Athens, it seems strange that the Greeks and Turks don\u2019t get along better than they do. They share so much history \u2014 both were a part of the Greco-Roman Empire \u2014 so much culture, music, and food, but in the 19th century became bitter enemies when Greece declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire. This enmity lasted more than 200 years. Greeks and Turks when they meet outside their countries become great friends, but inside their countries, where politics is concerned, they stare at each other warily. If you ask for a Greek salad at a Turkish restaurant. \u201cWe don\u2019t have Greek salad. We have Turkish salad,\u201d replied the waiter. He had a smile on his face and acknowledged that a Greek salad and a Turkish salad are almost the same. Indeed, their cuisine is quite similar, Meditteranean. Turkish feelings towards Greece are contradictory. \u201cWe are brothers,\u201d one Turk told me. Another Turk, however, expressed resentment at the Greeks, saying they can\u2019t be trusted. These two emotions \u2014 love and loathing \u2014 are common between Greeks and Turks, whose peoples endured a painful divorce. They are now forging two separate identities as competitors, adversaries, and wary allies. If you had watched the movie, My Big Greek Fat Wedding you will think how similar Greek and Turkish cultures are. Both cultures emphasize large extended families that live close in proximity to each other. There is a passion for singing and dancing and doing things together as a family. Family members tend to get into other family members\u2019 personal business, and there are super-strong bonds of love, caring, and humor about each others\u2019 foibles. Considering all the above similarities, we modern Greeks are more proud of our heritage. \u201cMy ancestors were writing philosophy and performing plays when your ancestors were still swinging in trees. We Greeks are the descendants of our great forefathers the Ancients Greeks. Yes since then we have been occupied, sold and betrayed. We lived as today the Greek Diaspora in many places but at the end of the day we Modern Greeks are proud of our HERITAGE and 90% in Greece are Greeks. Therefore if you get acquainted with our thousands of years history my opinion is that the Anatolians are deep rooted influenced by Hellenism. ",

            "answer_text": "Anatolians what? If you mean Neolithic Anatolian Farmers, then yes, the majority of Greek ancestry derives from Anatolian and Aegean Neolithic people who introduced agriculture in Europe and contributed the majority of genes to the admixture of present Europeans. If you mean Turkish people, no, there is no detectable East Asian Ancestry in present-day Greeks. The gene flow during the Ottoman rule was the other way round, from Greeks, Balkan, Armenian and other Anatolian and Middle Eastern people to the Ottomans. Other Anatolian peoples inhabiting the area at one point or another (like the Hittites or the Luwians) have been subsequently assimilated into different populations, so it\u2019s possible that a number of them have indeed been assimilated into the Byzantine and then the Ottoman Empires. They themselves, likely, were also largely descendants of the Neolithic Anatolian Farmers.  Extract of spreadsheet of PuntDNAL K12 ancient calculator, utilising public data from the Reich Lab in Harvard and the Estonian Biocentre to detect ancient ancestral populations, including Anatolian/Mediterranean Neolithic Farmers, European Hunter-Gatherers (combined Eastern, Scandinavian and Western HG in this case), Caucasus Hunter-Gatherers and Near Easterners. Note that East Asian ancestry for Greeks is \u201c0.00\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Every tribe came to Anatolia mixed with previous cultures; some of locals\u2019 adopted by newcomers and some of newcomers\u2019 adopted by the locals, eventually they ended up creating a hybrid culture. Greeks & Turks became a part of this too. This can be easily proven with some city names and local traditions, e.g city of Adana was Adanawa 3000 years ago and we only figured this out around 1960s, name survived well. Sometimes some groups had a larger ratio of literacy and they had more influence over their contemporaries. E.g 7\u2013800 years ago Turks that became Christian started using greek abc for writing Turkish. Greeks came to this side of Aegean sea ~3200 years ago and had more and more contacts with ancient east which was more advanced. They acquired lots of knowledge and occasionally added some more on top. The fact that the west acquired those knowledge from the greek texts, thought that its the greeks who started it. Huge mistake. ",
