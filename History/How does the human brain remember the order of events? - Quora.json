The primary container is context - the conditional shape of flow. We have few non contextual experiences -  First PrinciplesRMCM : 1 \u2026 We sacrifice the complete truth of any given Experience for the Value to which we are Constrained.  Complexities are hierarchical. The brain is complex. Experiences mostly fit into one or more containers prepared to receive them. They are \u201cstored\u201d in context and re-energized in context. One can \u201cwalk backward\u201d through such sequences with only a little effort. One can start also from any location in the hierarchy, moving forward (outwardly) or backward (inwardly) even sideways (laterally) into other experiences that are connected by similar contexts - according to the model there is a capacity for 21 connections for any given experience. Some connections only express themselves long afterward which has to do with density. ",
