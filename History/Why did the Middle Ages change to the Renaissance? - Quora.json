            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy did the Middle Ages change to the Renaissance?\u201d Well, first if the implication is that whole world changed from one state to another, it is not the case at all. Historians simply give names to different periods in history but these do not mean that the whole world suddenly changed. The terms Middle Ages and Renaissance refer to Europe and Mediterranean region, but not really to the rest of the world. These terms are not really mutually exclusive. The term Renaissance refers to a period from the late Middle Ages to the early Modern Period, in some sense a bridge between these periods. If you are looking for a brief description of how things changed \u2026 At the beginning of the Middle Ages, the great cultural power in the region was the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, with Persia a close second. Western Europe and western North Africa were dominated by various Germanic kingdoms that carried on some aspects of Roman culture but were far less developed in general. The Arabs came along and absorbed much of the Eastern Roman and Persian empires becoming, almost overnight became the dominant cultural force in the Mediterranean. The Eastern Roman Empire endured and was still economically significant, but second in importance to the Arab kingdoms. The Arabic Moors moved into Spain and parts of Italy heavily influencing the culture of Western Europe. Gradually the Christian kingdoms of southwestern Europe developed into economic and military powers and challenged the power of the Arabs and the Eastern Romans in the Mediterranean. The Eastern Romans came under threat from the Turks and gradually Christian Greek scholars fled to the West encouraging further intellectual development. As the Eastern Roman and Arab kingdoms were falling to the Turks, the Western Christian kingdoms were rapidly developing and creating their own high cultures. Later scholars called this emergence of culture in Western Christianity the Renaissance. The implication was that the Germanic kingdoms of the West (Spain, Germany, France) were the true descendants of the Roman Empire and the emergence of high culture there was a re-birth of ancient Roman culture.

            "answer_text": "The word Renaissance was invented to identify either (1) the new style of Italian painting and sculpture that became first fashionable in Florence in the 1400s and then normal throughout Europe, or (2) the expansion of university learning facilitated by the printing press (Gutenberg, 1440) especially the rediscovery of Aristotle, Avicenna and other non-Christian writers. The word Renaissance (=rebirth) does not by itself explain why anything changed from one century to another. Even after some revolutionary event (e.g. American Declaration of Independence, French revolution, Bolshevik revolution, etc.) most social changes in history are gradual rather than sudden, and seldom suggest any single cause.
