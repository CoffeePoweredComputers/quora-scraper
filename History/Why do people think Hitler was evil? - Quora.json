            "answer_text": "Uh because he was, I'll assume since you asked this question in the first place that you don't believe he was evil. Also, if you don't think he was I'll assume you have little to no knowledge or understanding of morals or ethics at all.  Lets start in the very beginning of his rise to power before getting into all the obvious Holocaust stuff. As he went from a mediorce street artist in Munich to Germany's chancellor he amassed quite a record of ethically wrong doings and pursuits. He seemed nice at first, promising to make Germany great again and all that, but with those promises came beliefs and attitudes that were simply wrong. For example, his idea of blaming the Jews for all that had befallen Germany since the First World War. Assigning blame to those it does not belong to (a simple solution for a complex problem), is wrong because it directs hatred and wrath of others onto innocents.  Soon we get to 1939 and Hitler invades Poland, yet another tally on his record. Intentionally starting a war that would be the direct cause of millions upon millions of not only soldiers but civilians too is very very obviously against basic morals that even a child understands. The war continues and Hitler continues to uproot Jewish, Catholic, communist, Roma, and other minority families from their homes and marches them off to internment camps with living and working conditions so poor that most die on their own in months. Again, that is quite obviously morally wrong, how would you like that if it happened to you or your best friend? So the war goes on and the Nazi leaders realize they can't possibly keep up a war and keep so many people in camps like that, so the \"Final Solution\" is unveiled and as we all know they began to systematically and effectively like no one has before or since, commit mass genocide of the peacful and persucuted Jewish population. Now granted that wasn't their original goal and intent, but they still did it nonetheless. Now for quite possibly the most over looked of Hitler atrocities, his long and remarkably successful career of lying to and manipulating the population of an entire nation to firmly stand behind him as he was directly and indirectly responsible for the deaths of millions.  I still fail to see how you could possibly ask such a ridiculous question but there you have it, a partial list of Adolf Hitler's countless crimes against the human person and the world. While I don't think he was the most evil figure in history, he was still horrifyingly evil and an absolute disgrace to the world and humanity.    ",

            "answer_text": "Evil is a subjective term. What one person thinks is evil might be considered heroic to another, particularly when dealing with politics and warfare. So instead, let's look at why Hitler was able to accomplish the atrocities he did.  Yes, it is said that he may have been abused as a child and faced other disappointments throughout his youth, including the loss of his siblings, conflict over his desire to study art, being a soldier on the losing end of WWI and being imprisoned for a failed coup d'etat. All of these disappointments may have played a role in Hitler's future actions, but that's only speculation. After all, disappointments like those experienced by Hitler weren't unusual in the late 19th century or early 20th century. Neither were Hitler's beliefs unusual. If society had thought him a madman, his rhetoric and actions would've been promptly put to an end. As we already know, that wasn't the case. What made Hitler dangerous is the amount of support he found. He surrounded himself with equally passionate and intelligent people  who supported him. He had strong public support for his campaign for  anticommunism, antisemitism, and a strong, pure, unified Germanic state.   Nothing of what Hitler believed was original to him. Pan-Germanism existed before him, as did anti-communism, and xenophobia. He was the charismatic leader who found a way to refine and turn those beliefs into mass-scale actions.  While the exact roots of Hitler's antisemitism aren't known, we do know that antisemitism was common in western Europe far before Hitler came to power. Riots, anti-Jew conferences, oppressive legislation, and group murders  of Jews became increasingly common from 1744 up until WWII. The Belle Epoque (1871-1914) saw a particular rise in antisemitic sentiment and xenophobia, especially in Austria and Germany. Hitler was born into this period and came of age in an environment of increasing political extremes.  As mentioned above, he served in the German forces in WWI, blaming Germany's loss and weakness on foreigners or alien races, particularly Jews. He is not the first nor will he be the last to blame an alien group for a nation's failures. (Even today, I'm sure you've heard someone blame weakness in the US on Mexicans or Europe's problems on Arab or African immigrants.)  If you really want to oversimplify, you could say that Hitler's being abused, repeated disappointments, and the tumultuous environment he was born into, combined with Germany's own inferiority complex, was basically a lethal combination.
