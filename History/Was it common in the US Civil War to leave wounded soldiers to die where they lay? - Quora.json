            "answer_text": "During the heat of battle, yes. Soldiers were often ordered to leave the wounded behind so that they would not endanger the advance by stopping to help their friends. Soldiers often reported a lull in battle, sometimes immediately following a remarkable effort by both sides, as if both adversaries had become exhausted in the effort. The opposing sides might now call a truce to care for their wounded and dead. Hippocrates is quoted as saying that war is the only proper school for a surgeon, yet prior to the Civil War physicians were loathed to undertake extensive procedures \u2014 often putting off surgery until the case was all but hopeless. Death and hardship have sometimes overwhelmed the histories of the medical advances made during the war. On a humanitarian level it is appropriate that this is so. More men died throughout this four-year period than in any other war experienced by the United States. \u201cAt every step some poor fellow would fall, and as his pitiful cry would come to my ear I almost imagined it the wail of some loved one he had left at home.\" \u2014Capt. John T. James, 11th VA Infantry   Men wounded in battle, if they could walk or crawl, often sought out a large shade tree on the fringes of the battlefield. Certain positions attracted many wounded especially if they were near a source of water, like the Bloody Pond at Shiloh.  Sometimes the wounded were carried to aid stations by their comrades, but this practice was frowned upon by the officers who considered it a form of shirking. Wounded men might be left on the field for several days by hospital and medical corpsmen overwhelmed by the number of wounded. Stomach wounds were thought to end only in a long, agonizing death. Many men with such wounds attempted suicide on the field rather than endure the pain. Doctors would often administer morphine in an attempt to ease the pain of those with fatal and inoperable wounds. \u201cAt a distance of about one hundred and fifty yards the enemy were lying down, and rose up in masses and fired one volley. I and one other member of the Brigade fell wounded . . . the bullet cut across my bowels and made a long and ugly wound . . . I was feeling no pain, but felt somewhat dazed. . . . The grape shot and shell were pouring thick and fast in our rear, a great number falling short of their intended mark, and it made me hopeful that it would soon put an end to my existence. I turned my head to the enemy, thinking that I might be so fortunate as to get shot dead. . . . As there was no sign of discharge [from the wound] . . . I thought [after a time] that possibly I was not mortally wounded. Then fear was uppermost and I crawled about 50 feet to a well rotted stump, thinking it would protect me from shot. I was not much more than settled behind it when the idea struck me that a grape [from artillery canister] could go through, so I dragged myself to a good sized tree about 100 feet off and stayed there some time in a reclining position, with head and shoulder resting against the tree. All the while the battle was roaring across the creek.\u201d \u2014Pvt. William A. Fletcher, 5th TX Infantry  \u201cThe road where we lay was covered with our dead and wounded. A battery of the enemy came thundering along it, and when the officer commanding it saw our dead and wounded on the road, he halted his battery to avoid running over them and his men carefully lifted the dead to one side and carried the wounded to the cellar of a house, supplied them with water, and said they would return and care for them when they had caught the rest of us.\u201d \u2014Sgt. Edward R. Bowen, 114th PA Infantry  \u201cI do not know how long it was before I became conscious but the battle was raging furiously; two dead men who were not there when I fell were lying close to me, one across my feet. . . . Two stretcher-bearers came and carried me back about fifty yards to a small stream that ran parallel to our battle line. Here was a depression in the ground some three or four feet below the general level where the wounded would be protected from the musket fire. . . . When I reached the stream the banks were already lined with many dead and wounded. Some had been carried there, others had dragged themselves to the place to die. Many were needlessly bleeding to death. Many died who would have lived if only the simplest treatment had been in the hands of the men themselves. My mind was clear . . . I knew I could not get to the rear without help, so made no further attempt. Fortunately my canteen had been filled; my thirst had become great and I had some water to wash the blood from my face. During this time the battle on our front continued with unlessening fury. . . . Looking back I saw a scattered line of the enemy coming toward us on the double quick. . . . They had to cross around or over the wounded and were cautioned by their officers to be careful not to disturb them more than was necessary. They passed over us carefully, without any unkind actions or words.\u201d \u2014Pvt. Rice C. Bull, 123rd NY Volunteers   Ambulance drill: Few soldiers died instantly in battle. Most bled out or died some considerable time after receiving their wounds \u2014 most from infection or complication. Wounded men sometimes went days without any care. The first battle of Bull Run left 1000 of the 2600 wounded stranded on the field with no efficient means of rendering them aid or removing them to hospital. Ironically, the war provided a unique opportunity to advance medical science and technology. By the end of the war, the manufacture of superior medical instruments had shifted from Europe to the US, and more than 15,000 medical doctors had received on-the-job surgical experience not available to their predecessors.

            "answer_text": "It was and is common in most engagements to leave soldiers where they are hit until the objective is obtained OR someone is free to assist that soldier. It was common in a good many wars for those who were slightly injured to continue fighting or alternatively for them to make their own way to a field hospital (self evacuation). The 'walking wounded' were those that were more injured but were still able to get themselves to an aid station or field hospital. The general reality was that wounded soldiers were not so much 'left to die' as there was no general practice or theory on how to get those soldiers to medical attention without endangering the mission and even where it did not endanger the mission there wasn't a whole lot of experience in transporting wounded soldiers. Basically they walked, were carried on a stretcher (not pleasant on rough terrain), or were tossed into a wagon with no shock absorbers or over the back of a horse. The transport trip to the hospital could and did kill a great many wounded who may have lived had they been left alone and merely moved out of the direct line of fire. The bouncing, jarring trip frequently opened up wounds that had closed and led to soldiers bleeding out on the trip. Another part of the problem is the type of wounds created. Napoleanic war, and US Civil War wounds were made by cannon balls or a lead minie ball that weighed about as much as a .50 caliber machine gun bullet weighs today. Impact wounds from these sorts of projectiles do terrible things to a body. A bullet like this that hit a bone would frequently shatter the bone for inches in every direction of the impact point. Also as a lead bullet that was not a ball it had a tendency to flatten and/or tumble when it entered the body and leave a wound much more like that of a hollow point bullet than a regular full metal jacket or round ball. That sort of wound is nasty to treat and quite simply until the 1880's the medical knowledge didn't exist to fully treat that sort of wound. ",
