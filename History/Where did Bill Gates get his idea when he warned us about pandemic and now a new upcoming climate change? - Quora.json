Trump enters rage when people speak of him. Bill Gates by comparison sees only the true pathways of the world. Trump uses a cheap versionof napalm for cheapprotestors silently standing near the gaate as trump and creew of vigilantes beat and gas people for no reasonexcept to allow trump to hold a bible upside downin front of a churchhe has never visited nor prayed in except he knows that is a statue of Pope Jean Paul the Second. He implies some of the respect for that pope will ruboff onto him. Mostof us would refer to that as dust and bird poop on the statue.

Because Bill educated himself by actually hearing what the scientists were saying, he\u2019s in a position to warn the planet, not so much about this one, but to call the next one. Some people will never listen and therefore, never be prepared for the next time this happens. And they\u2019ll b*tch and moan that it\u2019s nothing, or \u201cjust a flu,\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s a liberal hoax\u201d then, just as they do now. Human nature. smh ",

I was studying and teaching Thermodynamics while he was working with this buddies on his MS Op Sys. He never took Thermo in college or studied medicine but we let him opine on Climate Change and viral diseases as if he was qualified and because he is rich we should pay attention to him. On Climate Change he is basically an idiot and on viruses, he does have a number of smart people in his employ but I would not ordain him as a technical expert on that subject either.. ",
