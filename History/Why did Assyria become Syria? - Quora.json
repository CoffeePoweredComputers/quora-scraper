            "answer_text": "While the term \u201cSyria\u201d derives from the name \u201cAssyria\u201d, it actually refers to the region in the northern Levant as opposed to northern Mesopotamia. This is because the Hellenic Greek Seleucid Empire used the term \u201cAssuria\u201d (\u1f08\u03c3\u03c3\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1) to refer to both northern Mesopotamia and the northern Levant. By Roman times, the name referred exclusively to the land in the northwest Levant, which was primarily the homeland of the Aramean people. The Arameans, like the Assyrians, would convert to Christianity. With the arrival of the Islamic conquests, most of the Arameans and Assyrians would convert to Islam and Arabize. These new Arabs called themselves \u201cShawaam\u201d (\u0634\u0648\u0627\u0645) or Levantines. When the French created the Mandate of Syria in the northwest Levant, the people of the Mandate called themselves \u201cSuriyyun\u201d (\u0633\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0648\u0646) or Syrians. The term endures to this day to refer to the citizens of the Syrian Arab Republic. ",

            "answer_text": "Historically, Assyria & Syria are the same thing and the naming has to do with time period and translation into various languages. The region of Syria/Assyria/Mesopotamia fell under multiple empires and polities for centuries, meaning it lacked independence (however, there were semiautonomous regions at points). After the partition of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century, Syria reappeared as a mandatory state of France. In its original design, it encapsulated almost all historically Assyrian/Syrian lands from the Mediterranean to the Zagros. Because of various events that occurred, plans changed. Ethnic Assyrians still identify as \u201cSyrian\u201d in their language, but the modern state of Syria endorsed Arab nationalism for a time causing a break in the two terms. Because of this, the two terms are no longer synonymous as they had been historically, but have asymmetrical overlapping. Namely geographical. ",
