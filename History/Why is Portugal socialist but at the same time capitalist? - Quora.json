            "answer_text": "Portugal is not socialist. It\u2019s governed by a so called socialist party. The economy is capitalist. And guess what, the Socialist Party is voted in and can be voted out, but the reason people vote for them is precisely because they seem to do a good job at managing capitalism. The Portuguese Socialist Party is not revolutionary, doesn\u2019t want to abolish capitalism and in fact is a moderate Social Democratic organization. The idea that a country is socialist because it\u2019s governed by a party that has socialism in its name is as absurd as believing that the United States is democratic only when the Democrats are in charge and a Republic only when the Republicans are in charge, as if names of parties had the magical power to change the entire system.
