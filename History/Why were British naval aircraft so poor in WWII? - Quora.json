            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll question the premise by saying that British naval aircraft were quite effective and quite well adapted for the conditions they faced, given the technology available in 1939. Germany and Italy didn\u2019t have any aircraft carriers at all. The USA and Japan put much more effort into aircraft carriers and carrier-borne aircraft because early-WW2 land-based aircraft didn\u2019t have the range needed for operations in the Pacific. Japan had the A6M Zero; the USA moved from the biplane Grumman F3F to the monoplane Grumman F4F Wildcat starting in 1940 (the F4F was also used by the British). The Zero had a remarkable combination of range and maneuverability achieved by a ruthlessly less-is-more design philosophy - a 940hp engine and 3700lb empty weight, compared to the Wildcat\u2019s 1200hp and 4900lb. But the A6M wasn\u2019t made in substantial numbers until mid-1941 (total production to the end of 1940 was only 102) so we have to be careful about comparing aircraft from different years at a time when designs were evolving very quickly. Designing carrier aircraft is a huge challenge: they need to have a low stall speed for takeoff and landing; a powerful engine to accelerate quickly at takeoff; rugged construction to withstand the shock of arrested landings; high reliability because ditching at sea is often fatal; but a short fuselage and short or foldable wings to be manageable in the small spaces of carrier hangars, elevators, and deck. Land-based fighters in 1937\u20131940 were making a huge transition from biplanes with fabric-covered surfaces, to all-metal monoplanes with much higher speeds - but those designs were problematic for use on carriers. Higher speeds are bad for carrier takeoffs and landings; if you made a monoplane with large wings to allow low-speed landings, it would take up a lot of space on a carrier. And British carriers weren\u2019t aiming to fight only in the Pacific - they had to be effective in typical conditions in the North Sea and the North Atlantic. Strong winds, rain, snow, often very low visibility. The Swordfish was astonishingly effective in those conditions - it could fly off a carrier in terrible weather conditions, while carrying a heavy load of weapons. They tried a lot of other more \u201cadvanced\u201d designs - the biplane Albacore, monoplane all-metal Blackburn Skua, and the Fairey Barracuda (entered service 1943) - but none was good enough to completely replace the Swordfish, which remained in operation until theend of the war. Though to be fair, development of new carrier aircraft became a lower priority once Italy stopped fighting in Sept 1943, and the sinking of the Scharnhorst in December 1943 left Germany with only one battleship. TL; DR Nobody else had anything quite like the Zero, but that was in 1941. British carrier aircraft were ugly but got the job done. ",

            "answer_text": "They weren\u2019t. The Fairey Swordfish sank more tonnage than any other torpedo bomber during WW2 and was the first naval aircraft in the world to have an integral radar fitted. The two factors may have been related. The open cockpit and biplane wings were considered necessary from a flight safety perspective. Later in the War the Barracuda, the RN\u2019s first monoplane torpedo/dive bomber (t/d roles were complimentary in the RN) proved to have an awful safety record, somewhat justifying the initial RN/Fairey decision. If your question relates to how conservative RN designs were, then the answer is somewhat more complex. The Fleet Air Arm wasn\u2019t formed until the 24th May, 1939. Up until that point the Royal Navy\u2019s aircraft were operated, maintained and flown by the RAF. The obvious problem with having a sister service providing your aircraft is two fold. Firstly, there were no RN officers with any operational flying experience, making the RN institutionally conservative when it came to flying operations. Most senior officers were basing their decisions about aircraft procurement and operation on an outsider\u2019s perspective. They often failed to grasp basic operational limitations on airframes and didn\u2019t understand the capabilities or limitations of the aircraft currently in service. Google Captain D'Oyly-Hughes, RN for an extreme example of that attitude. Secondly, the RAF had no incentive to pursue a more effective Naval Arm. Every penny the British government authorised for shipboard aircraft came at the expense of land based ones. The need to provide experienced personnel to a dangerous and stressful environment was a significant drain on RAF resources. If the British aircraft industry concentrated on naval requirements they might very well lose focus on landed ones. It suited the RAF as an institution to have the RN operating older, cheaper and less glamorous aircraft. Consequently, between the Wars, the RN requested aircraft based on their desired capabilities, rather than on what was technically feasible and desirable from a design and operational perspective. Aircraft like the Blackburn Skua were highly advanced, but poorly conceived. The combination of dive bomber and fleet defence fighter into a single aircraft was surprisingly effective, but far from ideal. Once the War started, the RN were pushed to the back of the procurement queue. They were denied eight gun, Merlin engined fighters because those were required for home defence. The first request for a navalised Spitfire was sent in May 1938, but it would be late 1942 before the RN were supplied with significant numbers of the type and even then, they were based on the obsolescent Mk V, rather than the much more capable Mk IX in RAF service at that time. Fairey offered a temporary solution, creating a long range heavy fighter based on their Battle light bomber. The Fulmar was an outrageous success, all things considered, but it was only intended to stopgap until the RR Griffon engined Firefly went into production. The Firefly was ready for production in 1942, but the RAF decided that they needed an upgrade for their Spitfires, so Griffon production was prioritised for a series of Spitfire variants. It was 1944 before the Firefly eventually entered service. A 367mph fighter with a four cannon armament would have been highly competitive against contemporary aircraft in \u201842- it offered similar performance to most Italian and German single engined types and outperformed USN and IJN fighters then available. But by 1944 it had been overtaken by numerous excellent late War designs and was relegated to ground attack duties. It was a decent aircraft and served numerous navies and air forces until the start of the 60s, but it wasn\u2019t available when the RN needed it most. Luckily, the British have generous friends. The US allocated a large number of superb naval aircraft to the Andrew during the War and allowed us an extended period to pay for them. Thanks, chaps! :-) ",
