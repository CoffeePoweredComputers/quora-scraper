            "answer_text": "\u201cAs simply as possible, what is the government's role in the economy?\u201d Note: \u201cis\u201d, not \u201cshould be\u201d. The primary role of the government, economically, is to separate as much wealth as possible from the productive and give it to the unproductive. Taxation is used to directly remove wealth from productive people, and hand it to bureaucrats and other parasites. Some few token services are \u201cprovided\u201d by government in order to prevent the taxed from rising up in revolt.Regulation is used to indirectly remove wealth from productive people, by protecting vested interests from competition and thereby allowing those interests to charge higher prices. Some of that wealth is then fed back into the coffers of government bureaucrats and politicians through campaign contributions and other bribery.Confiscation of property through such mechanisms as fines, fees, and \u201ccivil asset forfeiture\u201d, directly fund government bureaucrats and bureaucracies, which last year totaled greater wealth just from asset forfeiture than all the private, that is \u201cnon-government\u201d, crime, combined.Prohibition fosters a category of entrepreneur who specializes providing \u201cillegal\u201d goods and services, at higher than market rates (of course). Some of that wealth is then fed back into the coffers of government bureaucrats and politicians through campaign contributions and other bribery.InflationWhile the first four of these examples are well understood, the mechanism of robbery through \u201cinflation\u201d is as misunderstood as it is effective. When a counterfeiter in his mother\u2019s basement prints up currency, everyone recognizes it as a crime because that counterfeiter is buying \u201csomething for nothing\u201d. When the Federal Reserve engages in \u201cQuantitative Easing\u201d, they are doing exactly the same thing. Those firms and insiders who receive the new currency then spend that currency by buying real goods and services, for nothing. The wealth stolen through inflation causes all other means of robbery to pale into statistical noise.  Stock market boom? Or just insiders buying up stocks with all that free money? Either way, it\u2019s not you. ",

            "answer_text": "The federal government's role in the economy follows. The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;To borrow on the credit of the United States;To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States;To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures;To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United States;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;Much mischief is done under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause (for instance, the establishment of a national bank under the latter). The Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is the only to address an economic role for the national government, which it really doesn't do as it only clarifies apportionment issues under Congress's tax power. Naturally, the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (banning slavery) and the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (banning making or selling of alcoholic beverages) together with the 21st, repealing the prohibition, had sweeping economic impact. Regulatory impact, such as the FCC's recent ruling essentially creating a Department of the Internet, appears often to exceed federal authority, especially as such rules do not even come from Congress. Courts have been showing more willingness to curb such excess. We'll see. ",

            "answer_text": "Is or should be?   The questions asks about \"is\" so I'll answer that one. Our government collects taxes, predominately from successful individuals and businesses, and doles it out to special interests.   These might be groups that supported the current administration in the past, financially or electorally, or ones from whom the administration hopes to garner their support.  In a similar way the government develops regulations to benefit these same special interests.   This is what the government does intentionally. Unintentionally, the government is played like a fiddle by large corporations that use their superior resources to direct regulations in a way to benefit themselves and lock-out smaller, disruptive competition.   Public sector unions use the government to feather the pensions for legions of bureaucrats and lead the government into irresponsible borrowing to fund it.  Farmers use the government to raise their crop prices at the expense of the consumers.    The net effect of this all is less freedom and less prosperity for most of us. ",

However there is a need for certain other goods, which can be called public goods, for the functioning of economy. These include roads, law and order and so on. These goods have certain specific features. Let us take a streetlight as a simple example of public goods. When one person gets the benefit of a streetlight, a few others can get the benefit at the same time. This is called indivisible. It is very difficult to exclude somebody from getting the benefit of a streetlight. There may be a need for a fence around it and a security gate and this is very expensive. This is called non-excludability. Due to this reason, it is difficult to collect a charge from the users of a street light (since a charge can be collected only if the non-payers can be excluded). When a charge/price cannot be collected, private parties may not be interested in providing such goods. There is a need for a social entity to provide such goods by collecting tax. This is the role of the government. ",

            "answer_text": "Government is an institution which works towards the welfare of the nation-state. It works towards multiple dimensions such as protecting rights of the citizens, maintaining law and order, securing the nation from internal as well as external threats, and of course making economic, political and social policies for the welfare of the people. Govt\u2019s role in the national economy is certainly one of the most important pillar of policy making. It plays an important role in maintaining the peace and prosperity in the country, subject to, they are designed for the welfare of the people. Govt\u2019s effective interventions in the economy could lead to the inclusion of poor into the mainstream economy, establishing state of the art infrastructure, providing basic needs to the citizens with respect to health benefits, educational development, employment generation, which ultimately results into the growth and development of the nation. Observation could be made from the working of the Chinese, Hong Kong govt\u2019s role in their nation\u2019s economy, they have maintained their economy\u2019s growth and development of the people. Even the biggest democracy in the world i.e. India, is certainly doing a lot of role play in the national economy by making policy interventions such as, GST, Make in India, Skill India etc, which directly or indirectly affects the economy of the country and would certainly lead towards the betterment of the people. There is no denying the fact, that sometimes the policies backfire as well, as demonetization did in India in 2016, but again the policy wasn\u2019t a bad one it was the implementation that made the economy cripple. There should be interventions of the government in the agricultural policies. The main motive of which have to be in the best interest of the farmers. The dimensions that play major role in agricultural economies like subsidies, markets, availability of loans, drought control regimes etc, has to be the main concerns while making economic policies. The government should also work towards the sustainable and environment-friendly policies. Today\u2019s major concern is sustainability and environment, so they need more interventions. Environmental change is a cause of earlier economic policies of developed countries, which made it a big concern as it is getting worse day by day. So the govt\u2019s role is to make better policies which are in the interest of sustainability and environment for the benefit of the future generations. The govt\u2019s also performs many roles in maintaining the best interest of the people of the country while making regulations on private sectors role in the economy. They establish many institutions to look into for any loopholes which might result as a threat to nation\u2019s economy. For example in India, we have institutions like SEBI which regulates securities markets in India. Govt\u2019s role in the economy of the country should have to be a well-defined process which takes different dimensions into the picture, from maintaining fiscal deficit to inviting foreign investment to further making interventions in international trade and into the generation of employment, from agricultural role to environment friendly policies, it should perform all dimensions equally for the betterment of the country.
