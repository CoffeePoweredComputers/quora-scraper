            "answer_text": "Very unlikely.\"Observers\" can be opiniated on this topic these days but \"observers\" usually a name for \"Do not vote in Russia\".Russians-voters support to Putin on the contrary makes it extremely unlikely that Putin gets dethroned soon. For dethroning the democratically elected president of a sovereign nation you need either a vote from citizens of that nation  OR -if you prefer to bypass the ballot- what you need is brute force. Both routes are very unlikely here: On the ballot route Russians voters today support Putin and approval rate is extremely high above 80% Putin's Approval Rating Hits All-Time High at 87%. Extremely unlikely Putin is dethroned by a vote from the people of Russia now...On the brute force route it is very unlikely that it would come from inside Russia because Russians opinion would not accept a coup given how much they support their president and police + justice would play their role anyway.On the brute force from outside Russia it would require that \"Observers\" rally the voters of several influential democracies say USA or UK or Germany or France and massively turn their citizens into voting for the local candidate who would have the program to dethrone Putin by force.In my country -France- such political option does not even exist and there is no possibility to vote today on a political program that would be \"let's dethrone Putin\" so impossible today that the country gets there.I think it is more or less the same in other countries eg. USA or UK or Germany voters do not have that political option available and would not buy into an official attempt to dethrone by force anyway. Finally there is the non-official and secret route to try and dethrone no matter what voters of the target country want and without informing the voters of the country going the secret route. On this I am confident that the named country USA UK Germany and France do not get involved into such practices against democratically elected president of sovereign nations and I know that they would face far too massive protests from their own people anyway.
