            "answer_text": "No such thing as an Egyptian or an \u201cAncient Egyptian\u201d race. Being an Egyptian in the modern context is nothing more but a nationality and I will demonstrate that below. Anyways, Egypt has always been a melting pot so ignore the 2 sides, whether it be the Afrocentrists or the modern Egyptians that think they are \u201cPharaohs\u201d. The fact of the matter is this transcontinental region that crosses over to three continents called the Middle East is a highly diverse region. Each of the region\u2019s nations have 100s of genetic variations. Egypt has its Arab, Turkish, Circassian, Greek, Nubian, Armenian, and Italian communities(there used to be a Jewish community as well but Egypt kicked them out of the country due to the establishment of Israel and the Arab/Israeli war)  Anyways here are some modern Egyptians Arab features  European features  African features  Arab Features  African features  European features  Arab features  Arab features  European features  All these people have different ancestry but guess what? They are all called \u201cEgyptian\u201d, Why? Because being an Egyptian is not a race, it is a nationality and they are also called \u201cArab\u201d. In the modern context an Arab is someone that is culturally Arab and who is a native Arabic speaker and let us not deny that Egypt was responsible in the contribution for most of the Arab culture you see today, whether it be belly dancing, Falafel, the Hollywood of the Middle East, all the way to Arab socialism, the Salafist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood and basically what makes the backbone of Arab politics and Islamic ideologies. This is why Egypt is the Hub of the region. Even the negative aspects such as the ideology for modern terrorism, was created by the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafi Movement of Egypt. Qutbism - Wikipedia \u2026\u2026.\u201cQutbism has gained widespread attention because it is widely believed to have influenced Islamic extremists and terrorists such as Osama bin Laden. Muslim extremists \u201ccite Sayyid Qutb repeatedly and consider themselves his intellectual descendants.\u201d I went on a rant but anyways, Ancient Egypt was very similar when it came to this type of diversity and this is all due to Egypt\u2019s unique geographical location. It is an AfroAsian country that extends to Asia via the Sinai Peninsula. It was the historical hub of the region where people from all around sought refuge in the times of famine and War. So people need to understand that its geographical nature have turned the country into a melting pot for the past 5000 years. Stop this dumb argument already lol ",

            "answer_text": "I will like to ask these questions before attempting to answer\u2026 Are modern Americans the original(ancient) inhabitants of USA? Are modern Australians the original(ancient) inhabitants of Australia? The answers are NO!! There are a lot of people especially Eurocentric driven people who are bent on deceit and fabrications from all ramifications. Stating all kinds of hypothesis, DNA, results and lies. But some how they know the truth, displeased with it, they try to make themselves feel happy and misinform the gullible ones. Let us go to the source, how it all started. Before the first dynasty and the socio-political awakening of ancient Egypt as a political entity. The ancient people of Nubia were prevailing within that region, which was the southern part of Egypt and the northern part of Sudan. They gave rise to the birth of a new kingdom which was later known to be called Upper Egypt(Southern Egypt). That is why the early dynasties had kings that depicted negroid facial characteristics.  King Narmer of the 1st Dynasty  It is important to note that the Nubians and the Egyptians shared the same cultural values, customs, traditions and religion. And every true Historian knows that The Nubian civilization predates the Egyptians. Even till this day, most of the people in the southern part of Egypt are blacks https://www.google.ae/search?hl=en&biw=1280&bih=682&site=imghp&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=people+of+southern+egypt&oq=people+of+southern+egypt&gs_l=psy-ab.3...289613.298995.0.299818.29.29.0.0.0.0.301.4263.0j22j2j1.25.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..4.20.3430...0j0i67k1.1yPFxkBaL30 The ancient Egyptian civilization started from the southern part of Egypt, which was called upper Egypt. Then gradually moved northwards to what was called lower Egypt, in the present day northern Egypt. Lower Egypt was proxy to the Mediterranean sea and the middle east, which easily made that portion vulnerable to attacks from other civilizations. From the Assyrians in the 7th Century BC, the Persians in the 6th Century BC, the Macedonians in the 3rd Century BC, the Roman, Arabs, Turks, French and British. All these centuries of dominations led to the whitening of Northern Egypt. ",
