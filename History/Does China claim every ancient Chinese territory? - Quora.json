            "answer_text": "Beijing\u2019s claims to nearly all of the South China Sea are now embossed in new Chinese passports and official maps. \u201cNew kind of great power politics\u201d Chinese leaders and foreign ministry spokespersons insist with increasing truculence that the islands, rocks, and reefs have been China\u2019s \u201cterritory since ancient times.\u201d Normally, the overlapping territorial claims to sovereignty and maritime boundaries ought to be resolved through a combination of customary international law, adjudication before the International Court of Justice or the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, or arbitration under Annex VII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). While China has ratified UNCLOS, the treaty by and large rejects \u201chistorically based\u201d claims, which are precisely the type Beijing periodically asserts. As far as the \u201cjurisprudence evidence\u201d is concerned, the vast majority of international legal experts have concluded that China\u2019s claim to historic title over the South China Sea, implying full sovereign authority and consent for other states to transit, is invalid and illegal. Why is it invalid ? The notion of sovereignty is not a Chinese or Asian notion but a European one that originated with the signing of the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. It was primarily a land-based concept and did not apply to nation-states in Asia and Africa until the mid-twentieth century. Before the Treaty of Westphalia, kingdoms and empires in Europe and elsewhere could not claim or exercise sovereignty. Critics to Chinas cartographic claims ? An in-depth analysis of the \u201chistorical evidence\u201d underlying China\u2019s claims shows that history is, in fact, not on China\u2019s side. If anything, Beijing\u2019s claim to the Spratlys on the basis of history runs aground on the fact that the region\u2019s past empires did not exercise sovereignty. In pre-modern Asia, empires were characterized by undefined, unprotected, and often changing frontiers. The notion of suzerainty prevailed. Unlike a nation-state, the frontiers of Chinese empires were neither carefully drawn nor policed but were more like circles or zones, tapering off from the center of civilization to the undefined periphery of alien barbarians. More importantly, in its territorial disputes with neighboring India, Burma, and Vietnam, Beijing always took the position that its land boundaries were never defined, demarcated, and delimited. Put simply, sovereignty is a post-imperial notion ascribed to nation-states, not ancient empires. ",
