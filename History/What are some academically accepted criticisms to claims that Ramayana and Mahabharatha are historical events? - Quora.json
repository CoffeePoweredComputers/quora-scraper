            "answer_text": "This is what historian Nandita Krishnan jas to say about Ramayana \u201cThe Ramayana is geographically very correct. Every site on Rama's route is still identifiable and has continuing traditions or temples to commemorate Rama's visit. Around 1000 BC or earlier, no writer had the means to travel around the country inventing a story, fitting it into local folklore and building temples for greater credibility.\u201d This is what historian Pushkar Bhatnagar says \u201cgeographical evidence for the epics is abundant. There still exist many places like Rameshwaram, Kishkindha, Kurukshetra, Hastinapura, etc. where the visits of Rama and Krishna are a basic part of local folklore.\u201d Lack of archaeological evidence is no excuse for denying the existence of history, sums up Bhatnagar. \"If the buildings of that time over 7000 years ago do not exist today, can we just infer that civilizations and personalities of that time also did not exist?\" Taken from Stephen Knapp's website ",
