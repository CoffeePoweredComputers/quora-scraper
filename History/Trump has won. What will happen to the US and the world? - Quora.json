            "answer_text": "I still have not gotten over a Plutocrat being elected as the savior for the poor and uneducated. It's kind of like DRACULA being hired as the manager of a blood bank. Funny, but kind of sad and true unfortunately. It's depressing for all, but especially catastrophic for the poor and uneducated that voted for The Donald. Healthcare The second thing The Donald will do is gut Obamacare (Obviously, the first thing he will do is legalize p**** grabbing). Democrats can filibuster (which they won't because they have no conviction), but it won't get them very far. Even if the Democrats did grow a pair, The Donald will eliminate the financial viability of Obamacare through the process of Budget Reconciliation. Thus, the end of a flawed, but semi successful universal healthcare program. The voodoo solution that The Donald will enact will be the country returning to a free market system. Even though we have seen the outcome of this before (young adults uninsured, cancer patients reaching lifetime limits, chronically ill being denied coverage), this time it will be magically different. Why? Because The Donald will say,  The result will be that the poor and uneducated that voted for Trump will be left footing the bills of the millions of uninsured who will go to the emergency room and eventually default on their medical bills. Immigration Perhaps the most disturbing thing about this election is The Donald won 30% of the Hispanic vote. How the hell is this possible? I get all Hispanics aren't a monolithic voting group, but when someone repeatedly insults your heritage and background, it becomes bigger than your personal beliefs. Although 30% of Hispanics support the wall, it won't be built because it's not feasible (even if it were feasible, The Donald would have as much success as he did with casinos in New Jersey). Even if he were able to construct a concrete wall, which would prohibit the border control from seeing the other side, private land ownership would constitute an expensive and timely barrier to getting the wall constructed. Either way the wall will not get built.  As it relates to a Muslim ban, it was only rhetoric The Donald used to sweet talk the racists voters of his support base. He has already removed the Muslim ban link from his website. But even if he attempted something so brazenly stupid, every minority group in the U.S would be out protesting. The unrest would ultimately cease the foolery at once. Economy If there's one thing The Donald knows, it's the economy, even if he had a $20 million head start and several bailouts. Oddly enough, the economy will be just fine (really fine for the leftist elite)\u2026 for everyone who's not poor and uneducated (namely the poor and uneducated who voted for The Donald). Even if The Donald wanted to implode the economy, Carl Icahn wouldn't allow him. What will happen though, is business as usual: Lower taxes. Less regulation. Lower Taxes Taxes will be lowered with respect to high income earners and corporations. That will always be a given regardless of who is in office. Mind you Obama never seriously touched the Carried Interest loophole. Nobody (namely politicians) works against themselves (political donors). Well, what about the poor and middle class? The true middle class derives a fair amount of income from long term capital gains, which already has a lower tax rate (and soon to be lower). While their income taxes may stay the same or even go up a little higher, they will still profit handsomely from the lower capital gains taxes on a booming stock market (yes booming stock market; don't believe everything the media says because the rich capitalize on inefficiencies created by the media everyday) and a regressive social security tax that is capped at $118,500. There are two types of poor. The first is a single parent family in which the single parent works two minimum wage jobs. They will be fine actually because they are on the left side of the income pyramid for the Earned Income and Child Tax Credits. That means every February (this may become January again because I'm sure The Donald will scrap regulations related to tax refund loan sharks), they will receive a tax refund of several thousands. The other type of poor are the two parent families (both parents work extreme hours to make up for the fact they never got a college degree) that move to the suburbs, even though they can't afford it, to avoid minorities (not necessarily crime). As a side note, the biggest con game ever perpetrated by the elite is to divide the poor by races. That means no more rebellions against the rich.  But I digress. These group of individuals will be impacted the most adversely. They make just enough to not qualify for the lower income refundable tax credits. But they don't make enough to take advantage of the middle class loopholes. This problem is exacerbated by Republicans. The outcome of lower taxes is a booming stock market that benefits the wealthy who have enough money and wherewithal to capitalize on the opportunity. Below are two stock charts illustrating what happened the last two times we had a two term Republican:   Both these time periods have two things in common. 1. The stock market eventually took off. 2. The poor and uneducated The Donald voters didn't participate in this because many of them didn't trust the system and/or they had a defined benefit pension plan, as opposed to a 401k plan that would have grown exponentially due to the power pyramiding and compounding. Additionally, many did not have disposable income from their depressed wages. Note: If it seems like I'm bashing poor uneducated voters from the rust belt who voted for The Donald, I'm not. I'm just objectively illustrating why they committed suicide. It's good to be passionate, but often times catastrophic decisions are made when we\u2019re most pastionate. Less Regulation For some reason people think less regulation is better because greed and corruption will never incentivize the ultra wealthy to victimize those who are less fortunate. This is almost as foolhardy as the NFL trusting the players to self report HGH use. Once The Donald takes office, corporations will have carte blanche with respect to running an efficient business. Great! But what does that mean? Running an efficient business includes keeping wages as low as possible and providing the least amount of benefits to your workers as possible. The only caveat is that the workers most impacted are the ones with the lowest qualifications and least options (hourly workers, as opposed to salaried workers). As you might have already guessed, the poor and uneducated that voted for The Donald will be the most vulnerable. In addition, less regulation means more price gouging for the consumer (yes the AT&T merger will go through despite what The Donald sweet talked his supporters). Again, this will impact the poor and uneducated.  Supreme Court As it relates to the Supreme Court. During The Donald's time in office the Supreme Court will become ultra conservative and right wing on many of the rights that we enjoy as Americans. Many poor and uneducated Trump voters believe this is good, but it's actually catastrophic for them. One of the first things that will happen with the new Supreme Court is abortion will be severely restricted. This means individuals who normally would get abortions because they can't afford a kid, will now be forced to have and raise that kid. The outcome of this will be thousands of more children born into poverty. The result of this will be more crime 20 years from now because children born into poverty often don't escape poverty as adults. Additionally, there will be more competition for lower level jobs, which will hold the wages down regardless of inflation. Last but not least, the demographics of this country will permanently shift in the favor of minorities, which will hinder the Republican Party in the distant future. International Affairs Perhaps this is the only partial benefit to having a loose cannon in office. The past several years we have seen numerous accounts of World leaders disrespecting our president. While some of this was due to race, the vast majority of it was due to the fact America is no longer respected globally. Sometimes the threat of violence prevents violence more than being peaceful does. Going forward I suspect China will no longer be pacifying North Korea\u2019s aggression towards us. Instead, they will force Kim Jong-Un to get his act together. Unfortunately, I suspect Russia may not be finished with the U.S. There's a reason why The Donald blew up when he was called a Russian puppet. Perhaps the reason may have something to do with the frequent communication that took place between The Donald\u2019s campaign team and Russia over the past several months.  At the threat of being exposed, The Donald will become a pawn for Russia. This means Russia will continue their activity in the Middle East, and ultimately create conflict with Eastern European NATO members. This dissention may ultimately create mass chaos in Europe. The Greatest Country in the World Believe it or not, this time will pass too. Even with The Donald and some of his supporters doing everything possible to tear down this country, this is still America (God\u2019s country) at the end of the day. This means GOOD will eventually beat EVIL/FOOLISHNESS. Until then, do everything you can to pull yourself up in society because we know what awaits the poor and uneducated who voted for The Donald. Furthermore, the poor and uneducated who voted for The Donald will soon learn that sometimes the devil you know is better than the devil you don't. ",

            "answer_text": "Relax, this Republican is here to tell you that the sun will still rise and set every day. Trump is a New York conservative, if he was in Alabama he would be a liberal. There won\u2019t be a nuclear holocaust, not because he can\u2019t but because he won\u2019t. It\u2019s bad for business. This is not to say there aren\u2019t lessons to be learned in this. It was clear from the beginning of this race that the Democrats and the national media were salivating over having Trump as an opponent. They kept their ammo dry and waited till after the conventions to start unloading on him and they waited too long. I can see how inviting that was, it even looked like a good plan. So why did it fail? Because the media, the DNC had become tone deaf. For 8 years anyone who disliked an Obama policy was told that they did so because they were a racist. If they weren\u2019t called a racist they were shrugged off as an idiot incapable of reasoning. They were told repeatedly that everything was wonderful in the land, meanwhile they were desperately looking for jobs that were no longer there and watched their homes and their dreams vanish like smoke. The media and the powers Washington did a wonderful job of shutting them up so they remained quiet, they sulked and they waited. We watched debates where the moderators joined with Clinton in attacking Trump. Where the slightest rumor was treated as fact and our present government did all they could to support Clinton. Even to those of us who didn\u2019t support Trump this looked like ganging up, and most Americans relish a fair fight. Did you ever watch that TV show called All in the Family? We all sat and laughed at how backward ole Archie Bunker was. How little knowledge he had. But we missed something very important. Archie was the only one who was working, paying the bills, and supporting his son-in-law\u2019s quest for a college degree. Archie just gave you the finger. ",
