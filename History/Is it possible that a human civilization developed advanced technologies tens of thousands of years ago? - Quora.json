            "answer_text": "YES!!!ill be showing you few things which were invented thousands of years ago which will make you believe that ancient human civilization had developed advanced technology... 1. MAGICAL ROMAN TECHNICOLOR CUP   you may think whats so unique about this cup...first let me tell you some basic info about this cup.This is an ancient roman goblet, it was made 1600 years back,it was just a piece of antique till the researchers found out that when light is focused on it from front it looks something like this     and when light is focused on it from back it looks like      In 1990, British researchers tried to unlock the mystery of the devil's beer stein. What they found was that the glass was full of gold and silver flecks 1,000 times thinner than a human hair. Basically, the Romans discovered nanotechnology -- the science of manipulating incredibly small particles -- and used it to make a bitchin' pimp cup.To make the cup, they would have had to grind up gold and silver into grains many times smaller than sand and fuse it to the glass in specific proportions to produce subatomic effects that we're only just beginning to understand in recent decades.For some reason, the scientists weren't allowed to take this millennia-old relic and fill it with Tang and tequila just to see what happened. So they did their best to replicate it and found that it would probably also have changed colors based on what kind of liquid was poured into it. It's a Hypercolor chalice! What's more, it's even more effective at detecting different kinds of substances in water than modern sensors are, which means that science is actually considering using a piece of technology from the time of Caesar to improve modern substance detectors. 2. ANCIENT GREEK PROGRAMMABLE ROBOT.what if i tell you worlds 1 programmable robot was built in 1st century!!!  this was the robot was invented by heron also known as hero of alexandria,It might seem silly to call what Hero built a \"robot\" considering it was a wooden three-wheeled cart powered by string instead of electricity. But using a system of timed weights and pulleys, the thing could move by itself, turn corners, and hopefully sass nearby humans. Despite its crudeness, computer scientists say that this is basically the way that all robots operate. It's just Hero's \"strings of code\" were literal strings. They even built one to show that it works and wasn't just the product of Hero's fevered imagination Hero didn't actually do much with it besides entertain the masses and hopefully get a little strange now and then. At least, as far as we know. Maybe we're all stuck in some kind of Ancient Greek Matrix right now, and the world we think we know is just an elaborate knitting project designed to keep us docile.(you can search on youtube for its actual working) 3. VIKING COMPASSES. Navigating the ocean back in ancient times was extremely tricky, given that they didn't have GPS, compasses, or even shuffleboard on those rickety old cruise ships. If you wanted to go from, say, Europe to the Americas back then, you were just as likely to crash into Madagascar since all that water looks the same out there. Scientists were puzzled about how the Vikings were consistently able to travel in a totally straight line from Norway to Greenland and back, some 1,600 miles, while the rest of the world was rowing around in circles, too proud to ask the passing mermaids for directions. Then, in 1948, they found an ancient Viking artifact under an 11th-century convent and concluded it was a shockingly advanced compass.Before magnetic compasses, ancient mariners had to find their way using sundials, which told time and direction by shining a shadow onto a disc. As you can imagine, at night or even on a cloudy day, they were about as useful as reading tea leaves and sacrificing a goat to Odin. But the Viking compass, known as the Uunartoq disc, had ways of getting around that. On top of being an amazingly sophisticated sundial with several shadow sticks to work out the cardinal directions, medieval records of the device refer to a \"magic\" crystal that enabled it to work even when the sun wasn't available. And while we're still jaded enough to put \"magic\" in sarcastic quotes, researchers believe that a certain kind of crystal placed in the device could have created a pattern on the disc when exposed to even dim light, which they could have used to find their way.Upon testing, scientists found less than 4 degrees of error, which is comparable to modern compasses. Even with these results, we still don't know everything about the compass or if it was even more accurate, since half of it was missing when we uncovered it. 2. Ancient Metal Plating   We know that people of the middle ages and earlier had the ability to coat materials with thin films of metal like gold and silver. In fact, their methods functioned even better than the ones we use today. We still haven't caught up to the middle ages. But it gets better: the Iron Pillar is a column in the Qutb Complex of Delhi. It was built around A.D. 400 and enjoys thoroughly mocking archaeologists and metallurgists, because it's 1,600 years old and it has not corroded yet. Compare that to your 1994 Ford Festiva and you might start to see what an accomplishment that truly is. Studies of the Iron Pillar show that its composition is unusually high in phosphorous, which seems to have shielded the metal underneath from the ravages of nature. It basically nurtures a thin film of harmless rust that gets metallic Stockholm Syndrome and fights off deeper, more damaging rust. That's not an accident: earlier iron works are lacking that phosphorous, while several later structures were forged in the same fashion.ancient Indians bought the undercoating, and it's still paying off millennia later.  well this are few of the 1000s of inventions which were made by ancient humans we are still unaware about them which are not yet discovered!!!

            "answer_text": "We don't know any such thing. People have been continuing to evolve. When you consider that the age of some well-known mutations like the East Asian EDAR variant, the variant that leads to blue eyes, or the one for red hair, are all not much more than 10,000 years old, you can see that firm conclusions about our exact genetic makeup 100,000 years ago are hard to reach. But as to your followup question, I don't see why genetics comes in to it anyway. It is also known, for example, that people had larger cranial capacity about 20,000 years ago; even if we accept genetic changes, it does not mean our ancestors would have been incapable of building a civilization or inventing some technology. It would not surprise me to learn that there were many isolated cases where something was invented, flourished locally, and then was lost and forgotten again. We are often surprised by what some prehistoric peoples were capable of; for example, there is evidence that people in Austronesia were deep sea fishing over 40,000 years ago.  Suppose some stone age genius had invented writing, and had taught it to a few specialists in local tribes, so that they sent messages back and forth on hides and bark for a few generations, fifty thousand years ago - and that the secret was lost in some disaster. How would we know? It would require unusual luck for any remnant of their communication to be passed down to us. As for large lost civilizations, though, that would be harder to hide. If people had invented glass or gold ornaments or pottery or concrete, and produced it on a large scale tens of thousands of years ago, we would probably have found some of the leftovers. ",
