            "answer_text": "English is a Germanic language, while Latin is an Italic language... neither is a direct ancestor of the other. Instead, English and Latin are both members of the Indo European language family, with English belonging to the Germanic branch and Latin belonging to the Italic branch (see below). As far as the family tree analogy goes, English and Latin are merely \"cousins\". This cousin relationship is evident in the fact that some Latin words and their English counterparts \"look similar\": the English word for father is \"father\", and the Latin word for father is \"pater\"; the English word for one is \"one\", and the Latin word for one is \"unus\".    Most people do not think of the above examples as the primary way in which English and Latin are connected. Rather, they point to the preponderance of words in English which appear \"Latinate\": they seem like Latin loanwords. Some Latinate words are Latin words which appear without any modification in English (\"senator\"); some are not exactly Latin words but are very obviously derived from Latin (\"congress\"); and some are actually modifications of French loanwords (\"debit\") which in turn originally arose from Latin. In fact, the majority of words in English which we call \"Latin\" words are actually from French. The family tree above is certainly not the best Indo European diagram available (on Google Images), but I chose it because it includes a dotted line from French to Middle English, illustrating the unprecedented borrowing from French that occurred during the Middle English era. Where did this borrowing come from? William the Conqueror! William of Normandy took control of England in 1066 at the famous Battle of Hastings, and brought forth a merging of English and Norman French culture that included language mixing. Remnants of this mixing are still visible today in the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom:    The scroll on the bottom is in French, and means \"God and my right\" (as in the absolute monarchy philosophy espoused during the 1600s). The phrase on the blue belt-looking thing (a garter) is \"Honi soit qui mal y pense\", which looks like French but is actually Anglo Norman for \"shame on him who thinks evil of it\". ",

            "answer_text": "As the other two answers from Raj Bhuptani and Rob Weir point out, English is not directly related to Latin. English is a \u201cWest Germanic\u201d language in its descent, but Latin is an \u201cItalic\u201d language in its descent. However, Latin has profoundly influenced English in its development through loanwords. As much as 40\u201360% of our current vocabulary are words that come from Latin, though the exact percentage shifts depending on how you tally the number (do plurals of a singular count?) and whether you include indirect borrowings that were originally Latin, but which we borrowed through Romance languages. Many times in history, we have borrowed directly from Latin or through an intermediary like French or Italian or Spanish. Our borrowings happened in \u201cwaves\u201d including the following periods in rough chronological order: Pre-insular Latin borrowing (really ancient words Anglo-Saxons borrowed from Latin on the continent before they ever migrated to England)Early Christian Latin borrowings (words borrowed from Augustinian monks who settled in Kent after 597 AD)Late Christian Latin borrowings (loanwords borrowed after the Cluniac Reform in the early 800s AD)Early French borrowings (from the Norman Invasion), which ultimately trace their origins to LatinNorman-Latin borrowings (Latin words that were borrowed after Norman priests replaces the ecclesiastical hierarchy of native Anglo-Saxons, but which did not pass through French first)Late and Central French borrowings (more Parisian than Norman, often borrowed during the Hundred Years war or later during the Enlightenment)Romance language borrowings, often from Spanish or Italian during the Renaissance.Pseudo-Latin and Pseudo-Greek scientific names created to describe new inventions (usually from the 19th and 20th centuries).",
