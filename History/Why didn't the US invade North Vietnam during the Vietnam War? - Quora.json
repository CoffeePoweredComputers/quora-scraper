            "answer_text": " Because after incidents like the My Lai Massacre were exposed to the world in 1969, America lost any last remaining shred of credibility that it was fighting a war against \u201ccommunists.\u201d My Lai was literally the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for an American public that had just about enough of the U.S. military\u2019s lies, cover-ups and shenanigans. For those who may have forgotten or are unaware, the iconic picture above is from the infamous My Lai Massacre taken by U.S. Army photographer, Ron Haeberle on 16 March 1968. It shows civilian women and children about to be killed by American soldiers. (Seconds after this photo was taken, everyone in this photo was machine-gunned to death by the American soldiers who were surrounding them.) Prior to being murdered, though, these civilian villagers from My Lai were rounded up by U.S. Army soldiers from C Co. of the Americal Division\u2019s 1\u201320th Infantry who were on a \u201csearch-and-destroy\u201d sweep through their village looking for the enemy. Instead of the enemy, however, was a village of women and children civilians who were rounded up, many raped, scores beaten and all of them summarily executed by the American soldiers of Charlie company in a hail of gunfire and grenades. Just before this photo was taken, the woman carrying the child on the far right of the photo had just been raped by a U.S. soldier from Charlie company. After Ron Haeberle snapped this photo, every person in this picture was mowed down by U.S. machine gunfire from the U.S. soldiers surrounding them using an M-60 machine gun and M-16 rifles. 500 other civilian villagers \u2014 all young children, women and old men \u2014 were also murdered by Charlie company soldiers that day. In the aftermath of this massacre, the U.S. Army attempted to cover up the incident for almost two years and would\u2019ve gotten away with it, had it not been for a freelance journalist named Seymour Hersh who found out about it while stateside while talking with a recently discharged soldier from Charlie company. Hersh corroborated his story with other discharged eyewitnesses and subsequently broke the story open to an already war-weary and anti-war American public in 1969. At this point, many Americans who were merely on the fence about Vietnam \u2014 perhaps with an attitude much like today that we should support the troops regardless\u2014 became properly incensed and began tipping the scales of public opinion against the war and demanding that the U.S. get out of Vietnam already. At this point in 1969, My Lai for all of its tragedy helped expose the U.S. war in Vietnam for what it actually was to the rest of the world \u2014 not a war against \u201ccommunists\u201d like Korea was, not an \u201cinsurgency\u201d against the Vietcong like McNamara et alia tried to make everyone believe, but rather a brutal genocide and war crime perpetrated against civilians, women and children non-combatants. After My Lai was exposed in 1969, to continue to insist rhetorically that the U.S. had any sufficient reason, any remaining justification, let alone any casus belli to invade North Vietnam just to \u201cwin\u201d \u2014 let alone continue a pointless and misguided campaign of genocide against the Vietnamese people using an outdated circa 1960 \u201cDe Opresso Liber\u201d specious canard and fallacious trope replete with disproven and anachronistic references to The Domino Theory and Global Communist Domination \u2014 would\u2019ve garnered you a well-earned round of jeers, non-stop mocking contempt and peals of laughter from any American or sane individual for that matter who had at least a college degree or an I.Q. over 100.

            "answer_text": "A lot of people here are talking about the China involvement. This is undoubtedly true. But also from the start of escalation, there was a lot of opposition to the War. Given that a further escalation to invade the North - even if China didn\u2019t get involved - would have required many more troops, the country would have been massively opposed from the start. Johnson tried to fight the war while affecting the normal American\u2019s life as little as possible - hesitancy of calling up the National Guard, of raising taxes, of limiting consumer goods. Of course - the 57,000 killed and multiple of that wounded, among all that served there are affected\u2026 Also, there was some amount of fiction that the US wasn\u2019t even fighting North Vietnam, rather Viet Cong forces which were internal to South Vietnam. We never even declared formal war on North Vietnam - the legal basis was the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which gave Johnson generic combat powers. Of course this was utter BS; while the Viet Cong had some independence, the North was sending men, materiel etc down the Ho Chi Minh Trail from the beginning. But the fiction was beneficial to both sides for various reasons. But to actually invade the North would probably have required Johnson or Nixon to go back to Congress for a Declaration? Hard to invade a country you aren\u2019t at war with. Although maybe not - we dropped plenty of bombs without one. So, first our generals were too smart to start another war with China. Second, neither Congress nor the populace would have permitted it. Probably each of these on its own would be enough to prevent it, and both together certainly were. ",
