            "answer_text": "In 3 words: Very beautifulGood peoplePossessive (not always, but often)Some tips for dating Polish girls: - Polish girls usually have a very good taste on dressing up. Get ready to match their outfits. - Fitness is a top priority for many Polish girls. Sharing this activity will add many points to you. - Be careful with personal space. Hugs, kisses to the cheek and in general touching, will make people you just met quite uncomfortable. Even more between men, who might see it as very homosexual. - Planning 1 week in advance is common here. Spontaneous planning is not a thing. - Complaining is a national sport in Poland. Don't let it influence you. - There are very beautiful girls almost everywhere and in great quantities. This might be the reason why even the most astonishing beauties tend to be very down to earth, polite and even talented in arts, languages, sports. They are usually quite easy going and nice. I say this by comparing it with other countries where very pretty ladies tend to be superficial, hardly accessible and rude. - Getting to know someone, make friends and talk about private things takes time and effort here. Even though poles are more open than Germans and Escandinavians, they take their time to open. - Go for expressing your affection more in the form of chivalry and taking care of them than with kind words. Girls here are not used to hear a lot of love words too often. If you do so, they might find it fake or immature. Specially to when saying \u201cI love you\u201d. That one is saved for special occasions most of the time. That being said, don't forget to tell them what you like about them. ;-) - Girls will assume you have something serious after dating +5 times (or earlier). So if you don't look for a stable relationship, better clarify it soon. - 9 out of 10 Girls here love when you kiss their hand. - They tend to be possessive. This means they will expect you to dedicated most of your time to being with/around them. Spending frequent time with friends is not so tolerated. Even less female friends. If this is something important for you, make it clear from the beginning. - Polish girls tend to have more control and dominance on a relationship than other cultures like Latino, Arabic or Chinese for example. Also many tend to raise their voice. That's normal here, don't get offended. If it annoys you, just explain how it works for you and find a compromise. - On the other hand (ironically) Polish girls tend to be very close to their male friends. In some extreme cases I've seen them giving them small kisses lips to lips. Even while having a bf or being married (and their partner seeing it). It was shocking to me. But if it happens to you. Cool down, and talk it with your gf so that these things don't happen to you. - Dancing closely is generally appreciated as flirting. So unless your gf has traveled the world or you are in a dancing class. Be careful with dancing salsa or even worse, bachata with other girls. - Polish guys aren't usually great dancers. Some dance moves will be a great plus here. You don't need to be a master. Latin dances are the best for finding girls at night. - More traditional / pop music clubs tend to be harder for meeting/approaching girls. Polish people tend to go out in closed groups and guys are often quite jealous, even more if you are foreigner. - This being said... Polish girls LOVE foreigners. Specially tanned Caucasians and latino. Oh and Ofc Americans are very appreciated for their \u201cVisa potential\u201d. - Dating between drastically different ages happen more often here than in other more conservative countries. Teenagers having romances with guys on their late 30's or even 40's is quite a common sexual fantasy. - Some Polish guys see foreign attractiveness as unfair. Be specially wary of drunk hooligans or racists. More over in smaller towns. They won\u2019t hesitate to start a fight with you and will even look for any excuse to do so. Be calm, respectful and answer with a positive attitude, these type of people have no clue about emotional management and will likely get confused and calm down if you react nicely. - Approaching and respectfully complimenting a girl you don't know in the street will make wonders. This normally doesn't happen here so girls find it fascinating. They might get very surprised and will remember that for months. - Polish people in general are not as polite as other cultures like say British or Latino. This accentuates the further right you move in the country (closer to Ukraine or Belarus). There saying good morning to someone passing by at the park is not received possitively, but rather seemed as if you are trying to get something from them. - In bigger cities you can easily find girls with an open attitude to explore their sexuality with you. Role play, costumes, toys, and even bdsm, etc. Are quite a common thing. - This being said. ONS are rare, even more the night you met. Girls usually want at least a couple dates before going to bed. - Weed although illegal, is widely tolerated, expect it to be consumed in all sort of parties, even corporate parties. Don't be overly surprised if you see your whole work team including management smoking pot on a reunion. Other drugs like M and Speed seem to be also consumed by many in parties. - It's quite common to find older unsatisfied women in night clubs. They might be married so be careful with getting in trouble. - It's common for girls to have the initiative and invite you to dance while in a night club. Even to invite you shots. - 4 out of 5 girls will want to share a bill when hanging out. Except for a \"special or first date\" ofc. - In this culture, regular dates to nice restaurants is quite a thing. Don't forget it. Once a month is like the golden spot. - That being said. Polish girls most of the time won't care if you have a lot of money or not. They rarely get superficial and will love you for who you are. Really a beautiful aspect of the polish women. - Ideal dates: Coffee / lunch. Walk in the park. Night out dancing. Cooking at home together and Netflix n Chill. In that order. ;-) - Her friends / family will most likely offer you a lot of vodka. But feel free to limit your consumption. She won't take it as something bad or not manly, on the contrary, controlling your self in the presence of her friends/family will show maturity. Now if you HAVE to drink it, go for half-shots, just drink half of the first one and refill the other half, argue that you are not used to it. Eat plenty of food during the process to balance it. - Families in Central Europe tend to not be so close to each other as in warmer countries. But definitely closer than Nordic countries. They don\u2019t hug so much nor express their love frequently (some almost never). - You shall eat everything that her grandma offers. Don't fight it. Just get fat. - Polish weddings are a big deal and often last couple days. Get ready for that and don't dream on working the next day. I think I can go on and on, but I'll leave it here. Hope you find it useful. ;-)\ufeff ",

            "answer_text": "Bro, I\u2019m a chinese guy and work in Poland. It\u2019s just stereotype, cuz polish girls are also human, which means that they are different from each other. For me, polish girls are nice cuz they are independent, tough and willing to struggle for their own life. They are really hardworking, which is far much better than those Southern European lazy fellows. I got many polish female friends and I respect them a lot. As women, they just did what they were able to do. and besides, polish people (not only girls but also guys) are very friendly and nice towards foreigners, which might leaves us a very good impression. Polish females might smile to you and come to talk to you positively. I like them because I feel so relax when talking to them. I totally cannot speak polish but all my colleagues speak English pretty well and we are nice working together. My roommate is a polish girl, and she usually cooks and makes tea for me when I back from work. And we chat a lot, she also encourages me a lot when I face some problems. What a wonderful person she is. As comparison, I speak Russian, but all those Russian women no matter young or old, they all behave rude and selfish, self-central, never consider about anyone else, only for themselves\u2026 I like polish girls not for their beautiful appearance, but for their perfect personality, their struggle and their attitude towards the life. When I was in England, I saw many polish work really hard their for the living, but some of my local English friends just wanna find so-called \u201ccheap\u201d polish girls. I just told them to show respect to the ladies. Polish females got some famous idols like Mrs Curie and Jadwiga, I think they two can represent what polish females look like, sacrifice them to the belief of dream and never give up. if someone really want cheap girls, they might go to Russia. Plenty of cheap girl there you can find. ",

Polish girls hot this, Polish girls too religious that, honestly shut up! Polish women are not one, monolithic mass, each has her own values, interests, not every single one is family-oriented, religious or whatever. Do they look good? Yeah, but it\u2019s expected of them. There\u2019s a certain amount of pressure on Polish women (not only Polish women but you get the gist), to look attractive and to be thin, keep long hair and dress nicely. That\u2019s why most Polish women look like this when Polish men still dress like they\u2019re stuck in the early 00\u2019s fashion-wise and smell like sweat or cheap, musky perfume. Or both. I\u2019ve been living in Poland my entire life and know many Polish women and what I think is that they are diverse, many are insecure due to the impossible to meet beauty standards, and all of them are lovely in their own right. I also think that we should finally focus on something more than their looks, because there\u2019s so many other things we can appreciate them for instead. ",

And well, for the eating habits that some Polish people have, like all are surprisingly good looking physique-wise. But okay, the city I was in directly lies on water and the sunlight is a good option for preventing weight increase. They live a somewhat healthy live there I would say. The girls were beautiful, heartwarming and welcoming. I like the hospitality that people from Poland have. And I experienced it on my own, because I was for three of the days a guest in a Polish family. And I was the only boy chosen by a girl. I had to share the damn bathroom with her. It's not the same as with a person from your gender. She constantly smiled at me and I was overwhelmed with her beautiful smile (I have not that much contact with girls). I don't know if she did that on purpose or not. It seems like I got a crush on her, but that was not so surprisingly after all (I mean, she was so cute in her school outfit :\u2019) ). It's not usual that a Kaiju like me gets that close to a appealing girl. In my biased opinion Polish girls are beautiful and precious, etc. But the entire reality is obviously different. ",

This is a deliberately varied & random selection and, not a standard Buzzfeed, Top 10 Women You Didn\u2019t Know Were Polis . Because amazing women are all around. This list is by no means full or representative of the breath of awesomeness that Polish women generate daily. Feel free to add your Polish inspiring women in the comments.  Izabela Czartoryska  (Img: Wikipedia) One of the stand-out figures of Polish Enlightenment, who turned her court into a space for intellectual discussion collected art, and started a museum. Jadwiga of Poland (cos of where else?)  (Img: Wikipedia) First female monarch of Poland in 1373/4, who led the war against Red Ruthenia and negotiated with the Teutonic Knighs (before breakfast). Wis\u0142awa Szymborska  (Img: Brain Pickings) Winner of the Nobel Prize in literature. Wrote thought-provoking poetry and dirty limericks. Eliza Kruczkowska  (Img: Forbes) Used to be the CEO of StartUp Poland to head the Polish Innovation Fund. What does that do? Makes sure Poland is not just a geographical centre of Europe, but also a centre of tech innovation and entrepreneurship. Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska  (Img: Wikipedia) I don\u2019t know much about tennis, but her list of strophes, and accolades in the intro on wikipedia is three paragraphs, she already finished her tennis career and she is just 29. Agata Maria Ko\u0142odziejczyk  (Img: Gazeta Wyborcza) Neurobiologist who works in The European Space Agency (ESA), the description of what she does it a little too complicated for us mortals. Biomimetics\u2014how to use evolutionary adaptations of Earth organisms to help us in space exploration. Dobros\u0142awa Gog\u0142oza  (Img: Twitter) Founder of Otwarte Klatki (Open Cages), one of the most effective animal rights charities in Europe. Helena Czernek  (Img: Mi Polin, Facebook) Co-founder of the first Polish brand MiPolin designing judaica since WW2, and a creative designer of that brand.

Polish girls have their own behavior and attitude towards you, it is easy to communicate with them and they are directly involved in the expression of emotions. You will be told only good things. The gift that you brought, she will admire the whole evening.Modern Polish girls are very sociable. They quickly get to know each other, spend a lot of time on social networks and try to avoid loneliness. They can in five minutes decide to meet with a friend in a cafe, go to the movies, in an hour collect a backpack and go on a trip. To see this - you just need to go to any dating site, social network and chat with them. You can look at their interests and requests, for example, on the marriage agency's portal - they describe their requests and desires there and compare them with the requests of others. (link to profiles of Polish girls).Polish girls in fact are Slav, but very European Slav. Therefore, the conclusions should be consistent with this fact. ",

I myself as a Pole do not consider Polish girls as special beautiful, more than others in a sense of genetical shape of a body and a face. Maybe some of them yes, of course, but average woman in the street is simply average. But\u2026it all depends on what you consider as beautiful. If you talk about good manners, nice outfit, smile, kindness, being oriented pro family rather than single life then yes, definitely they are worth to call them beautiful and valuable in general. But if someone is looking for almost naked Barbies with duck-like lips, big ass and breasts then Polish girls are nothing like this. ",

But if we take the modelling industry as a norm, there are relatively a lot of Ukrainian and polish women in the int. model top 1000. The diversity is limited, as most Polish people have roots in Poland or the surrounding countries. I notice that most expats/foreign men in Poland, meet and marry Polish women. It is often the reason they live in Poland or stay in Poland. More so than in other European countries, I think. So I guess Polish women are deemed to be very attractive. P.s. For some reason most Polish women have a thigh gap. which is rare in other countries, as far as I know. It makes me think that Polish women posses on average many of the qualities deemed as attractive in Western Culture. ",

Poland for long centuries was a real melting pot of various populations, migrations, invasions, guests, royals, noble, magnates and royal intermarriages,. They have Eastern Europeans, Western Europeans, some South Europeans, North Europeans, The Swedes, The Batls, The Slavic populations, the Germainic tribes, the Turkic populations , the Mongols, the Tatars and the Jews during the invasions but also the Greeks (that were granted political asylum by the Polish government n the XX century. It all makes the people very interesting and genetically strong, it produces intelligent individuals as the genetic admixtures play one of the biggest roles in how the people are and function. So, having all those people and such great genetic diversity it simply produces some of the most beautiful women in the world. In Poland you can find very fair skinned and light eyed ( blue, green , grey), blond haired beauties, all the shades of blond hair, fantastic variety of the women with brown hair and even black haired and brown eyes beautiful ladies. However is there anything else that you may think of that makes the Polish ladies so beautiful and attractive? ",

Jokes aside, after living in the USA for a few years now, I did notice that there is an appearance difference between American girls and European girls in general. European women tend to take more care of themselves and seem to be more up to date with fashion trends. We are a bit more subtle in a way, waring less makeup and dressing up more elegantly. I noticed that when American girls try to be elegant they sometimes go borderline vulgar with their fake eyelashes, dark eyeshadows and tight dresses. ",
