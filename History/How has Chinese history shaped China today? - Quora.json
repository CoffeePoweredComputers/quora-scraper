            "answer_text": "In my opinion, history means a lot to Chinese. For Confucianism, history is the first lesson they need to learn before they can develop their own ideas, this is also a key reason why Chinese culture can last for thousands of years and never stop. The disadvantage is also obvious, Confucianism weaken Chinese innovation ability by put more weight on the history instead of the changing society and the future development. This can also explain why Chinese can\u2019t react quickly to the western civilization while Japanese can change quickly even though Confucianism is also their belief since their history is too short to affect their behavior so that they can turn quickly.
