            "answer_text": "No, and here\u2019s why. The point is that the 1950s get singled out too much for being looked at as a Golden Age, a halcyon time when everything was wonderful, prosperity reigned, and everyone was happy. And those who hold this outlook yearn for a return to that time, and believe that American should return to those golden days. The problem that the 50s were a Golden Era \u2014 but only for some Americans. The 1950s were also a time when women were \u201csupposed\u201d to stay home, clean the house, cook the meals, and raise the kids. When Blacks knew their place, and Hispanics existed to mow lawns and pick fruits and vegetables. And gay people, well, they didn\u2019t even exist \u201cback then.\u201d While there\u2019s no measure for the relative amount of racism in the country at different points in U.S. history, the 1950s were a decade where racist actions became overt, and were visible to anyone who read a newspaper or owned a TV set. As the Civil Rights movement kicked into gear, the racist reactions to that movement rose accordingly, and it wasn\u2019t just \u201cracist,\u201d it was armed resistance, police beating peaceful black protestors over the head with batons, and attack dogs sicced on calm marchers, and many murders (including, most famously, four little girls murdered when Klansmen dynamited their church). So that\u2019s why a lot of emphasis is placed on the negative events 1950s. It was a wonderful decade for many Americans \u2014 and a horrifying decade for many other Americans. ",

            "answer_text": "Do the 1950s get singled out too much for criticism for racism and conformity when those things also existed in the previous decades? Well, the 1910s had a World War and pandemic that killed millions. Much of the world was in survival mode. No time for conformity. 1929s had Flappers and gangsters and alcohol and a general lack of inhibitions. Not so much conformity. Plenty of racism, though. The entirety of the1930s saw the Great Depression, where everyone was pretty much in survival mode again. Not so much conformity there either. Still plenty of racism, though. For a large part of the 1940s, the world was embroiled in another World War, which saw hundreds of teenagers and twenty-somethings sent off to war. The ones who came home mainly wanted to resume their lives and start families, which they did in abundance. The Federal Government helped returning white American veterans achieve the American Dream by subsidizing cheap loans and mortgages and scholarships. Not so in rural, mostly black areas or inner cities, which were redlined by the banks, excluding their inhabitants from acheiving their piece of the American Dream. Which brings us to the 1950s. The 1950s were a time of relative peace and rising affluence. A white man could find work for a wage that allowed him to buy a house, afford a stay-at-home wife and a family. The suburbs grew - millions of cookie-cutter houses side by side in new mostly white communities sprouted up all over the country, pulling white families away from the cities. Not so much for black rural communities and inner cities, which were left to rot. So, from a white perspective, who WOULDN'T be nostalgic for a period of relative peace and prosperity? Unless you came up in that period in squalor exacerbated by racist banking policies, that is. Thanks for asking! ",

            "answer_text": "The criticism you refer to is really just an effect of another cause: the prevalent idealisation of the 1950s. The emphasis on the racial and cultural issues of the time are merely a reaction to the common notion held by older generations of the \u201csimple, idyllic\u201d old days. It is obviously worthwhile to point out to those folks that, if you weren't white and male, you probably didn't remember the decade that way. What you see as an overemphasis on the issues of that decade is really just a response to the overemphasis on idyllic American mythology that has no basis in reality. ",
