            "answer_text": "It wasn\u2019t. President Trump put in an excellent performance in the debate. He was calm, convincing, presidential, outsmarted Biden several times, congratulated the moderator on her fine performance, trolled the Biden family influence-peddling business, stood up for the OIl industry while Biden was mercilessly insisting on decimating it. Trump looked totally in command whereas Biden looked overawed by Trump's imposing presence and questioning. Trump did a good job cornering Biden on several issues: 'Joe who built the cages?' (in which immigrant kids were locked up. Built in 2014 by Biden/Obama administration). Joe sheepishly kept sidestepping that question. But Trump was relentless. 'No, let Joe answer who built those cages. Joe who built those cages?'. At one point Biden looked outwitted and exasperated and threw in the towel confessing, 'Well mistakes were made, but we also made improvements'. What surprised me most was how Biden walked into Trump's trap when it came to the Oil Industry. I couldn\u2019t believe my ears when Biden looked into the camera and replied (on Trump's calm questioning)saying something like, 'Yes, I will work to eliminate the Oil industry and replace it with Solar and wind. I mean, this should have been done long ago'. This was music to Trump's ears that Biden was incriminating himself as an OIl Industry disruptor. So he asked Biden to clarify his position regarding the Oil Industry. Every time Biden took the bait, even appearing incredulous as to what the big deal about shutting the Oil industry was? Biden needs to remember that this is not the Democratic primary, where candidates have to pander to the far left environmental vigilante mobs. Biden needs to take a more nuanced position. Not openly keep repeating how he will destroy the oil industry. After Trump got Biden to repeat that line several times about wanting to end the OIl industry, Trump calmly looked into the camera and said something like, 'I hope you are listening TEXAS. Also Pennsylvania I hope you are listening'. And that is precisely what was going on in my mind. What was Biden thinking? Places like PA and OH will not take kindly to such a rabid position against the oil/fracking industry. Trump fed 'truth serum' to Biden through some crafty mental judo and got hiim to self-incriminate by publicly declaring a 'War on Oil'. In doing so, Trump calmly walked away from the debate with a LOCK on the battlegrounds of OH and PA. I am not including TX and OK as these states are already locked in for Trump, but a lot of TX and OK votes were also lost to Dems after this debate. OH and PA are very important battleground states after FL. Biden's public declaration of a 'War on Oil' is the biggest takeaway from the debate. Because that sealed his fate and the 2020 election. And I hereby declare the Donald Trump winner of the 2020 election. November 3rd is a mere formality. The election was won and lost during the final debate. When Biden's virulent distaste for the Oil industry was laid bare by Trump. Trump also cornered Biden on his anti-fracking record and shifting rhetoric. In frustration Biden said that he never was against fracking, to which Trump retorted that yes there are tapes and that he can bring them up. And within a few minutes of the debate, his team uploaded a montage of videos of both Biden and Kamala clearly stating their intent to do away with fracking completely. [SIDE NOTE: Honestly, both Biden and Kamala have my sympathies in this regard. No Democratic presidential candidate can dream of getting past the Democratic primaries without embracing crazy ultra left environment friendly positions. So both Biden and Kamala whole heartedly embraced anti-oil and anti-fracking positions in the primaries, happily giving out sound bites on camera. Those extreme positions help the Dem presidential hopefuls out of the 'last man standing' WWE style 'cage match' that is the Dem primary. One which is closely watched by mobs of ultra hardcore leftist environmental vigilantes (AOC and compay and their millions of followers). But no sooner did Biden and Harris come out victorious from the Dem primary's 'last candidate standing' cage match, than they regretted their 'anti-oil', 'anti-fracking', and 'pro Green New Deal' rhetoric. Soundbites that they had to give to win the unforgiving Dem primary. Those statements today look juvenile, anti-employment, and anti-business. They are now compelled to walk back those extreme positions and to give themselves a 180 degree image-makeover. And as they begin to disavow their earlier positions, as Biden/Kamala did in their debates [\"I don't support the Green New Deal\", even though his website clearly states the opposite. And \"I am not totally against fracking\", etc.], AOC fires off tweets nailing their positional shift]. Biden looked helpless in the final debate. He struggled for ideas and searched for words, and was on the ropes. How sad! ",

            "answer_text": "Because the last four years have trained us to view politics as a reality show. Thank you, Donald Trump. There was already a widening partisan divide making people view every political event as either \u2018let\u2019s look for how we can be outraged at the enemy\u2019 or \u2018let\u2019s see how our team \u2018totally destroys\u2019 the other one\u2019. That was bad enough. Trump took it further by making the whole experience of politics into \u2018what crazy shit is going to happen on the next episode of \u2018Federal Government\u2019??\u2019 This is true of both his supporters and detractors. The detractors tune in to have their jaws drop and be outraged and get in circle-jerks about how unbelievably corrupt, revolting and immoral Trump and the Republican party are. The supporters tune in because they love how their \u2018enemies\u2019 are being driven into a frenzy by Trump\u2019s smug attitude and outrageous behaviour. Both are chasing a dopamine high. The worst part is this behaviour divorces politics completely from\u2026 politics, as in the actual policies that have an effect on people\u2019s lives. The people who can afford to treat this as a big reality TV show are the comfortable, mostly white, mostly middle or upper class people for whom the system works and will likely continue to work. They\u2019re gonna be just fine, so they\u2019re happy to have politics turn into a big TV show chasing the next outrageous moment of drama. Meanwhile, all the people who are suffering and dying - the immigrants, the poor, minorities, all of whom are legitimately afraid for their futures and possibly their lives - are seeing themselves turned into collateral damage in the pursuit of memes and twitter posts, outrage fuel and schadenfreude. It\u2019s really sad and really horrifying. The debate was boring because it was a bad episode of \u2018Federal Government\u2019, because it was actually about politics. Not about memes and fucking gotcha moments and mic drops. If you watched the debate thinking \u2018ugh, no one is burning anyone\u2019 then you need to take a long look at yourself and how you engage with the world. Politics is not meant to be a reality TV show. It has an actual effect on millions of lives which can be hurt or taken away by it. It is not a way to hurt people you don\u2019t like. It is not a convenient shorthand to form an in-group with. It\u2019s serious shit with actual consequences. Think about what it means that you are let down when you tune in and, rather than doing anything stupid or shouting crazy bullshit, the president of the united states actually had a civil debate. Think about how that is a disappointment. That is what is wrong with politics right now and on an individual level you need to change it by not giving in. ",
