            "answer_text": "The key word here is \u201cbeliefs\u201d I don\u2019t think they believe the same about much, if anything. They may say the same phrases, and speak the same language and truths but, for example. the Amplified Bible always adds, \u201ctrust in, rely on, cling to] whenever belief is mentioned. It has been my experience that most of them do not believe much of what they say or much of what the scriptures say. It is a lot of cherry picking and then watering it down until it has lost its essences. For example, most would agree that \u201cour God reigns\u201d and say it over and over. Yet, their lives prove that they don\u2019t think He reigns over much, in a practical, hear and now sense. they would also agree, as Mukesh Blake stated that \u201c Jesus Christ is the Son of God and Savior.\u201d But they most likely not agree on what salvation is or how to attain it or even what Jesus accomplished on the cross. and most ignore what His resurrection accomplished. This can be true even in the same local church. It was doubt and unbelief that characterized the fall in the garden, and not much has changed. We use the terms FAITH and BELIEF far to casually. God puts it FIRST on His list of things that please Him, \u201cWithout faith it is impossible to please Him.\u201d It is far more than a preferred thought or perspective. It is based on the surety and reality of God\u2019s word, which is more reliable than any tangible thing I can see, smell, taste, or touch. So, we can fiddle around regarding specific things in agreement (and there are many) but it makes no difference at the end of the day. Christianity as presented in the New Testament is an amazing and mind boggling relationship of oneness with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. One of union and communication and reliance. It is one of awe and incomprehension. (for who could possibly even begin to fathom the mind and ways of the One who created all?) ",

            "answer_text": "I believe in one God, the Father Almighty. Maker of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God; the only-begotten, begotten of the Father before all ages. Light of Light; true God of true God; begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father, by whom all things were made; who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man. And He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried and the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead; whose Kingdom shall have no end. And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, who pro-ceeds from the Father; who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets. In one Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins. I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. ",
