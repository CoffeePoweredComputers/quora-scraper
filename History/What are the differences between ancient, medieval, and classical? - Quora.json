The Early Middle Ages lasted from the collapse of the Western Empire in 476 to the Norman invasion of England in 1066; the High Middle Ages from the Norman invasion to around 1250; and the Late Middle Ages from 1250 to the onset of the Age of Exploration, often dated from Columbus\u2019 first expedition to the Americas in 1492. \u2018Classical\u2019 in this context is a period of ancient history lasting roughly from the 8th century BC to the Early Middle Ages. The term is used most often when discussing Greco-Roman history, mostly because that was the dominant civilisation in Europe throughout this time period. ",
