            "answer_text": "Most bombers, even \u201cnight bombers\u201d like Britain\u2019s Avro Lancaster, were used in both day and night roles. There were two general differences between aircraft used in the day and those used at night: radar and armament. Since night missions by definition almost always involved poor visibility, radar such as H2S was often installed in night bombers, although radar was also used on day missions in poor weather for bombing through clouds Day bombers tended to be more heavily-armed, although only by degree. The most-common difference was that night bombers generally had smaller-caliber machine guns, usually .303-caliber (7.62 mm) or so, and often had no ventral (belly) armament. This was typical for British bombers, which were developed for bombing at night, although some did use ventral turrets or ad hoc gun positions in the aircraft bellies. American bombers, which were designed with day bombing in mind, were usually armed with .50-caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns (lots of them), which had longer range, which was helpful during the day, since you could see and fire at potential targets from farther away as opposed to nighttime. Some Japanese and later German bombers, used in both day and night missions, had larger guns as well, in calibers from 13 mm to 20 mm. Since attack from below was more of a concern in the day, some B-17s, B-24s, and B-25s had remote-controlled belly (ventral) turrets that used periscopes and mirrors for aiming, but that didn\u2019t work out, so the \u201cball turret\u201d was developed for the heavies (B-17 and B-24). The ball turret wasn\u2019t practical for the B-25 (too large, too heavy, and too much drag), so the ventral guns were discarded and the position sheathed over. Some aircraft used a \u201cbathtub\u201d for ventral defense, where a man would lay down facing to the rear, handling one or two weapons. This naturally got very uncomfortable and tiresome on long missions.  A British-operated Fortress I (B-17C variant) with a ventral gun position. Later B-17s had remote-control or ball turrets in place of the \u201cbathtub.\u201d Bruce Brews's answer to What was the first aircraft with remote-controlled gun turrets? ",

            "answer_text": "Subtle. The last British bomber that was developed from a specification for a night bomber was the Whitley, and was the only night bomber in service at the beginning of the war. All the others, Wellington, Stirling etc. were not specified as night bombers and were intended to operate by day and, sometimes night. The two most famous four engine \u2018heavies\u2019, Halifax and Lancaster, were developed from a specification for a medium bomber intended to be operated primarily by day. In the most simplistic terms the RAF believed there were two things that would enable a bomber to defend itself in daylight. The first was a mid-upper turret* (particularly for the slower bombers which were vulnerable to beam attacks) and the second was speed. In 1939 they were wrong on both counts. Eventually the Mosquito would be a bomber rendered almost invulnerable by its speed. *The Whitley didn\u2019t have one because it was specified as a night bomber. ",
