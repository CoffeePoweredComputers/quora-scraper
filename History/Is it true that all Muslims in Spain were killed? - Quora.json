            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not true, no. From a different answer I once wrote on here, \u201c \u2026after the Reconquista [around 1490s/1492 approximately, that is; the final fall of the last Islamic kingdom in far southern Spain] about 100 yrs later the Spanish King and Spanish Catholic religious authorities at the time began to crack down more and more against what was left of Islamic (or \u2018crypto-Islamic\u2019) or even just Arabic-inclined cultural practices and communities there. Culminating in basically a countrywide expulsion event in the 1600\u2019s. Which apparently met varying levels of \u2018success\u2019 ranging from (some scholars estimate) around 40 or 50% \u2018successful expulsion\u2019 rate, to as high as near-complete expulsion particularly in the Valencia region for example. \u201cThese heavily de-populated regions were then sometimes (or often) basically re-populated with what they called \u2018Old Christians\u2019. That is, people from the more northerly parts of Spain, whose ancestors had never been Muslims or converts from Islam into (or ostensibly \u2018back into\u2019) Catholicism \u2014 and therefore were not at all religiously \u2018suspect\u2019.\u201d Basically then, as you can see, perhaps around half (very very roughly speaking) or more than half of the Muslims in Spain were expelled from Spain in the first quarter or so of the 1600\u2019s. In some parts of the country, the expulsion rate was quite higher however, or near complete (Valencia was mentioned). They mostly went to northern Africa. But the Spanish Muslims who were killed would have been those who fell in battles over the many many years of the actually centuries-long (rather \u2018gradual\u2019) \u201cre-conquest\u201d, fighting against the Spanish Catholics. There was not a Muslim mass-extermination event however, following the culmination of the reconquest. There was more so a mass-expulsion. ",
