            "answer_text": "All Tudor monarchs were powerful tyrants (yes even the boy, Edward VI). I say that to mean that during each of their reigns, they were largely successful in bending the country to their individual will. That being said, Henry VIII was the strongest because he was the one who was able to amass such power and authority almost unchallenged. To put simply, Henry VIII was the king his father (Henry VII) wanted to be, and all his children aspired to become: He was arbiter of Europe for a time, playing the field against richer and more powerful kings like Francis and Charles.He took the leadership of the Church in England away from the pope and into his own pocket; in the process, he amassed millions in gold and confiscated church property.He bent the parliament and the laws to his will.He was able to impose his own brand of Protestantism on the English.And the most amazing thing about all this is: the people loved him (mostly) for everything he did!",

            "answer_text": "Henry almost certainly thought he was, but historians are more mixed. To say his reign was controversial and politically consequential would be a massive understatement, but was he \u201cpowerful?\u201d Henry VIII was, in many respects, a larger than life figure whose grandiosity and bullishness tended to mask deep personal insecurities. Nothing more symbolized this then the famous tourney/summit he hosted with his French rival, Francis I, at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in northern France 1520. Both kings spent lavishly on the affair, each trying to outdo the other in displays of wealth and influence. Yet in a moment of ill-fated bragadaccio, Henry challenged Francis to a wrestling competition (technically against the rules of the tourney, since neither king was supposed to challenge the other directly). Francis ended up winning, much to Henry\u2019s embarrassment. Henry\u2019s reign was no less fraught with the conflict between the public image he wanted everyone to have of him and the reality of his rule, which would result in numerous expensive and financially ruinous wars and an England that would forever end up divided between Catholic and Protestant. The irony is that Henry began his rule as a defender of Catholic orthodoxy. He was a natural ally of Pope Julius II against France in the early part of his reign, scoring a number of important victories against the French, and Pope Leo X would go on to name him \u201cDefender of the Faith\u201d for his stance against Protestant reformers in northern Europe. Problems truly began when his Spanish wife, Catherine of Aragon, failed to provide him a male heir. As I mentioned before, Henry was very, very insecure about his image and legacy; he believed that only a strong, male heir would carry on his bloodline. He asked the Pope for annulment, which he refused. Now you have to remember, Henry had just spent away more than half his treasury defending Rome against the French king, a fact that, combined with an enormous ego not used to taking \u201cno\u201d for an answer, was a recipe for conflict, and not just with the Pope. By annulling his marriage to Catherine, Henry was also endangering his alliance with the powerful Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain, an alliance that his chief counsellor at the time, Cardinal Wolsey, had worked so hard to build and maintain. (This pattern of Henry ignoring his advisors in pursuit of his own short-sighted aims would repeat itself constantly throughout his reign.) Henry\u2019s decision to split from Rome would ultimately have devastating and immediate consequences in England. Thousands of English subjects who refused to follow Henry\u2019s example were executed as heretics under his rule. Some of Henry\u2019s most trusted counsellors, Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell, would end up being put to the axe as well, while others had to walk a fine line between doing what they felt was best for England and their ruler\u2019s growing impulsiveness. (Wolsey only just barely escaped execution himself, by dying of natural causes before he could be tried.) The situation was certainly not helped by Henry\u2019s lavish spending, which only grew more and more extravagant as the king grew older and ever more insecure. He commissioned up to 2,000 tapestries, ate and drank like a glutton, and boasted a large collection of personal weapons, including nearly 6,500 flintlocks. His spending induced his counselors to look for other means of income, which they got by dissolving the monasteries and abbeys. Even with these drastic expropriations, which were highly unpopular, Henry still didn\u2019t have enough money to prosecute his wars, and he was constantly having to confer Parliament in order to raise new taxes (something kings at the time were loath to do, since the lords in Parliament always demanded concessions in return for their support). His wars didn\u2019t exactly go as planned either. Despite their earlier disagreements, Henry did manage to secure a secret alliance with Charles V against France, an alliance that quickly fell apart with Henry\u2019s botched invasion of France in 1544. The conflict proved inconclusive; the Holy Roman Emperor, sensing Henry\u2019s disinclination to push further, signed a separate peace, leaving Henry with an expensive fiasco on his hands. (Indeed, he just barely managed to repulse an attempted invasion of England by French forces the following year). He ended up having to make his own separate peace agreement with French, his only gain for an expensive war being an 8 year lease on Bolougne. His attempts to arrange a marriage between his son Edward (by his third wife, Jane Seymour) with Mary, Queen of Scots, likewise ended in disaster; the Scots were still devoted Catholics at the time, and saw Henry as a murderous tyrant. They would end up warring with England for another eight years (the so called \u201cRough Wooing\u201d) When Henry\u2019s father, Henry VII, died in 1509, he had left him with a full treasury and some surplus lands in France; by the time Henry himself died 1547, the crown was bankrupt, the economy in the middle of a slump characterized by high-inflation, and Henry\u2019s poor diplomacy had left England with fewer allies and considerably more enemies. So\u2026..was Henry the \u201cstrongest Tudor?\u201d The short answer is probably not. He was, at best, an abrasive and mediocre monarch, one whose insecurities often led him towards petty tyrannies and rash decisions with consequences that his advisors often struggled to clean-up. Probably his only real \u201dlegacy\u201d was the English Reformation, a legacy in itself tainted by the untold amount of repression and murder of Catholics that accompanied it. ",
