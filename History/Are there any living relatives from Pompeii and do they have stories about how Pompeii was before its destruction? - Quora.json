            "answer_text": "Hi there, I am sure no, for 2 main reasons Pompeii was covered by volcano ashes 2100 years ago and it remained buried until mid 19th century. The ones that fled the city went to live elsewhere.2. 2000 years is a too long time frame for a human being. For sure there is no one still alive. As per reason #1 until mid 19th century no one knew about Pompeii, even people living there. The good news is that Pompeii itself will tell you how she was before that tragic event. The ruins are amazing, walls still standing like 2000 years ago, graffiti telling you about the life there, bodies of people who couldn't escape. Everyone and everything is still there\u2026 as in its last last day.   Body of a dog  Propaganda -  bodies of citizens caught by the volcano ",

Pliny the Elder failed and died in the process, but he got a nice IPA named after him.  (Photo credit) ",
