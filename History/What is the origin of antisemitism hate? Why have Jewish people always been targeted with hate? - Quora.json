            "answer_text": "Well, it started with Christianity. Christians got very hateful toward the Jewish religion. It is portrayed in a very negative way in the New Testament, which is part of the Christian scripture. And the New Testament has verses which say Jews wanted Jesus to be killed. Even though when Jesus lived, most Jews never even heard of Jesus. If they heard of him, well, they heard of him as the leader of a Jewish sect which believed he was the Messiah. They might have heard of him violating what Judaism considered the Sabbath laws. They might have heard of him violating what Judaism considered blasphemy laws. And, well, according to the laws of Moses in the Bible, breaking the Sabbath deserved the death penalty. And committing blasphemy deserved the death penalty. We can look at that as horrible laws, going against freedom of religion, and so draconian. Well, they believed that the laws are in the Bible, so they are from God. So that is why some Jews believed Jesus deserved the death penalty. Jesus in fact believed in these horrible laws too, but interpreted them differently. But the fact is that Jesus, when he lived, did not even have many followers of his sect. Other Jewish sects had more followers. So when he lived, he was just an obscure Jew, leading an obscure sect. The great majority of Jews never even heard of him at that time. And yet the New Testament even has a verse saying Jews were shouting \u2018His blood be on us and on our children\u2019, concerning Jesus. This would be of course a ridiculous thing for any Jew to have shouted. So it is a myth. But the result was that for many centuries many Christians blamed the Jews, including their children, for killing Jesus. Though even though a few Jews did believe Jesus deserved the death penalty, they did not kill Jesus. The death penalty was imposed on Jesus, by Pilate, a Roman governor, who was not Jewish, but pagan. And Jesus was executed not by Jews, but by Roman soldiers, who were not Jewish but pagan. But when the Catholic church later was made the official religion of the Roman empire, well, later paganism was banned, and ultimately was driven to extinction, but the Jewish religion was not banned, maybe because Christianity originated in Judaism, so the Jews survived in the Roman empire and in later Christian countries, as a minority widely hated for not being Christian, and often even accused of having killed Jesus. Then in the sixth century a man named Muhammad started a religion called Islam. Then there were later the Muslim conquests. So then later many Jews lived as a minority in Muslim countries. Muslim countries did not ban Judaism or Christianity, but people of those religions faced a lot of discrimination in Muslim countries for not being Muslim. So for many centuries Jews faced antisemitism in Christian and Muslim countries for religious reasons. It was not ethnic antisemitism, since Jews in Christian countries could avoid it by rejecting Judaism and converting to Christianity, and similarly Jews in Muslim countries could avoid it by rejecting Judaism and converting to Islam. So the antisemitism in those countries was not ethnic but religious. But then in the nineteenth century the idea started to spread in Europe that the Jews were a different race, and a bad race. So that started the ethnic antisemitism, which then could not be avoided by a Jew converting to Christianity. And this antisemitism reached its biggest horrors in the genocides of the Jews committed by the Nazis and the fascist regime of Croatia led by Pavelic during WWII. They just wanted to kill all the Jews they could find and catch, regardless of what religion the Jew believed in, or no religion, it did not matter. It was genocides caused by ethnic hate, caused by the horrible belief that the Jews are an evil race. So then it did not matter if the Jew was old, even senile, or a child, or baby, even the baby was considered to belong to an evil race. So this hatred led to the genocides based on the idea that the world would be better off with the people the haters considered evil would be killed. And similarly the Roma were also subject to genocides by the Nazis and the fascists of Croatia, who were allies of the Nazis, similarly due to the horrible belief that the Roma are an evil race. So it was due to racist hatred. And the fascists of Croatia also believed that the Serbs are an evil race, so the Serbs in Croatia were also victimized by the fascist genocide. Just due to racist hatred. ",

            "answer_text": "Jews have always been a pain in the ass\u2026its one of the things I like about them LOL. I am an atheist but beleive most myths have a kernel of truth to them . Something got the myths started and in the case of things like the 10 plagues GREATLY embellished but I think its safe to say jews were slaves in egypt possibly egypt was were judaism originated and borrowed earlier stories from other peoples. Anyway they were able to break free BECAUSE they were a pain in the ass. I think the Assyrians and babylonians would agree jews were a pain in the ass . Then came the romans . The romans had respect for the jews and gave them leeway that they gave no one else. I have my own take on the sanhedrin . Israel was occupied and the romans did coopt both the throne with harrod and the sanhedrin they both were collaborators but IMHO still did the best they could with in the confines of the occupation . Jesus was wrong to go after the money changers . jewish law said any money donated to the temple could not have pagan symbols on them and the sheckle was the ONLY kosher currency . the money changers were doing a public/religious service and could not do it for free, they had families to feed. Causing a ruckus at the temple DURING passover was not going to be treated kindly. Jesus knew what he was doing Getting back to jews being a pain in the ass the roman occupation was hardly trouble free and the romans had no problem hammering down the nail that stuck up. I dont beleive it ever got to pilot to condemn jesus . Pilot was blood thirsty even by roman standards his answer was always kill them . The sanhedrin were kept on a leash they needed roman approval to kill someone which again killing someone was not a high standard for the romans to meet The sanhedrin was right to be worried about what would happen after a general revolt look at the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD to see that. After the destruction of the temple early christians vied with the pharisees for leadership of the remaining jewish community and the christians lost badly , So there were genuine theological differences coupled with a case of sour grapes that led to bad blood between early christians and jews . Add to that the roman empire adopted christianity and being that it was pilot ( or at least a centurion ) who condemned jesus to death and roman soldiers who literally drove the nails ., Remember crucifixion was a roman form of execution now that rome was officially christian who was to blame for jesus death\u2026., THE JEWS!!! Not that the jews were all in the levant but 70AD did spread them much much further . As christianity spread so did blaming the jews for jesus and antisemitism ",
