            "answer_text": "CSK is one of the best IPL teams. It is one of the most successful teams of IPL. It has a huge die-hard fan base. It has the best record in IPL despite being suspended for two years. Let\u2019s look at the record of most wins in IPL history till now.  CSK is at number 2. But look at the win %. It is better than all the other teams. CSK has played fewer matches because it was suspended for 2 years (2016 & 2017). Now look at the other records; 2008- Runners-up. 2009- Semifinalist. 2010- Winner. 2011- Winner. 2012- Runners-up. 2013- Runners-up. 2014- Playoffs. 2015- Runners-up. 2016- Suspended. 2017- Suspended. 2018- Winner. 2019- Runners-up. No other team has this kind of record. It is the only franchise that has qualified for playoffs every time. CSK is the most consistent team of IPL and because of that, it is the second richest franchise of IPL with a net worth of RS. 732 CR.  One of the main reasons for CSK success is MS Dhoni. His brilliant cricket brain has helped CSK a lot. There are a lot of matches where his captaincy has done wonders. CSK fans call him Thala. It is very strange and interesting how a boy from Ranchi has been accepted by the people of Chennai. . . Hope you like the answer. Follow my page for more sports updates. Thanks, Aman ",
