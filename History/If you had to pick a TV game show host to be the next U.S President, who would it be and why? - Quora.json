Grew up low income, the child of a coal miner in West Virginia and then moved to the Midwest. Attended University. Spent some time as a homeless person. Took work as an autoworker, an insurance salesman, and a carpet layer and a mailman. Started small time in stand up and after years of dedication he now how\u2019s several network TV shows including his own talk show. Steve can now relate to everything from poor to the Uber rich. From professionals to auto mechanics. His view on the way the world really works could be an amazing asset to sit in the Oval Office. ",
