            "answer_text": "I honestly don't think Kampilans are that amazing. I\u2019m Filipino American and have done Arnis since I was five. I've also gotten to see swords from damn near every culture that makes them.  Here\u2019s the two I have. The top one dates back to around pre-WW2. The bottom one we\u2019ve had museums in the Philippines ask for. Needless to say, they're pretty old. So is the giant kris blade underneath it which is probably older than 100. Here's two of my favorites:  This is the state sword of Hawaii. It's a gold handle with carvings and has a I believe a ruby unlaced at the pommel. its really a beautiful sword to see.  This sword is for all of us who don't have a kings budget. This is the Cold Steel Horseman\u2019s basket hilt broadsword. While I have their normal basket hilt, this one really was nice. It\u2019s a simple design sure, but it has nice refined lines in the handle. It\u2019s a sword not a fashion statement, it does its job while looking good. It's the quiet badass that doesn't say much leading up to a fight but when it happens, it takes care of business. There\u2019s my picks for which swords look badass. If you want something that calls for attention, it's hard to go wrong with a sword fit for a king. If you want a sword for the everyday man that still looks good there's another choice. ",
