            "answer_text": "That honor goes to this guy, right here.  That\u2019s Albert Goodwill Spalding, one of the best players of the early major leagues, from 1871\u20131877. But he didn\u2019t make the money on the field. He likely only made about $60-$100 a month as a player. He made his money by becoming the world\u2019s first sporting goods magnate, starting the A.G. Spalding Bros. company in 1876, when he was still a pitcher for the Chicago White Stockings (Cubs).  Within 10 years, he was the president of the White Stockings and a wealthy businessman. In 1888, Harry Palmer described him as \u201cfancy Al. Spalding, the millionaire president of the Chicago club.\u201d By now, he looked like a cartoon 19th-century business magnate:  Spalding Sporting Goods standardized balls and bats and published the first baseball rules. It is still a major sporting goods player to this day. In this way, Al Spalding was the first man to make $1,000,000 from professional sports. He did this well before franchise values were that high, and almost a century before salaries were that high. ",

They may not have been the first but they started the trend of marketing themselves. Before that several athletes either married well had family money or invested smartly. Ty Cobb got in early with Coke A Cola stock. ",
