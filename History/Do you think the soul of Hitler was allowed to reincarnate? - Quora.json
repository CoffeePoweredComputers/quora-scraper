            "answer_text": "Yes. According to both Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma) and Buddhism (Buddha Dharma) reincarnation (the transmigration of the Atman, or True Self) or rebirth (the formation of subsequent life-spans in the style of progression) will happen always, because they are natural laws. They depend upon one universal law - the law of karma - cause and effect or casuality. So long as there is karma - volitional acts commited that havent yet been manifested in the form of results - there will be the formation of a subsequent life (either endowed by the same soul, or just a new life, attached to the previous only by means of casual dependence). So if we speak of soul, or Atman, we speak of reincarnation - and yes, Hitler commited huge act that influenced the world, producing outcomes that relate to heavy consequences he brought on the world - so the Atman will be stuck with a heavy load of karmic debt that it must live out, as to restore its own balance and contribute to the balance of the whole (Brahman) - for this to happen and for all the consequences to be lived out be the Atman, it will require enumerous lifespans. In both traditions karma also relates to merit, merit which will determine a good amount of the conditions of successive lives, thus, if the accumulation of negative karma (or bad karma) is excessive (given genocides, pride, killing, torturing, propagating ignorance etc) multiple reincarnations/rebirths may take place in lower realms of existence, within the Samsaric existence. Such worlds are Hells, Hungry Ghosts and animals. Infact if Karmic debt and ignorance are too strong, a being might fall to the lowest realms of existence, and will have to gradually, through many successive lives, generate merit and unclutter the perception, as to gradually take births in higher realms - passing through Hells, hungry spirits, animals and finally humans.

            "answer_text": "Yes, because Hitler's soul was made by the creator it is indeed eternal. It is and has been where it always will be in the eternal moment. We believe and Hitler believe many things about him and the world for that matter that are not true. Or aren't true if God really exists. God a perfect being is only capable of perfect creations. In a place where only one exists there are no other possibilities. God gave everyone everything that there is. He gave us the kingdom of heaven if there is nothing else then logic tells us we must be the kingdom of heaven. Which basques in the eternal moment that always has been and always will be. It requires nothing but the acceptance that you are everything or have received all that there is, which is attained by giving everything. Something that is real and perfect can be given away and kept simultaneously. Like an idea. This is the only way justice and perfect uncompromising equality can be exist. It's fucking genius. However God gave us free will. The world as I perceive it is a mixed bag of illogical difficulties and then I die. Does anything here last forever? This earth fails the test to be a creation of God. Yet if all that there is was created by God then what is this? It could only be an illusion that I /you dreamed up. I won't realize where I have been for eternity until I only acknowledge perfect spirit in my brother ? Offering only my blessing of peace no matter what I perceive as happening. When I realize Hitler didn't kill anyone. How could he if spirit is eternal? ",

            "answer_text": "Even if you are a Hindu or a Buddhist, I understand that there is a Hell - or even a variety of Hells - for truly black souls. Now everything Hitler did as a politician was designed for evil. It\u2019s not even a matter of the destruction of the Jews and the destruction or enslavement of Slavs and other groups designated for brutality, or the unleashing of the bloodiest war in history; it was something deeper. Hitler genuinely wanted to change mankind, and specifically to replace what he called an ethic of compassion for an ethic of strength - what you and I would call an unethical system of oppression, brutality and murder. Literally every political action he took was ultimately motivated by this idea. And if a man uses every energy he has, up to the moment of his death, to foster what can only be described as evil, is his place not among the lowest of the low? ",

            "answer_text": "I think when you kill hundret of people you will never incarnate again, and if you kill millions\u2026it\u2019s not possible. Each murder poison your being, if you exceed your soul limits you\u2019re done - soul is leaving you, and you merge with self created evil, evil replace soul, after that no incarnation is ever possible. Nature not allow to that because of capabilities to be good, with evil it was destroyed, it\u2019s not possible to be rebuilded or recovered. After some point there is no way back, if you destroy all goodness within, you can\u2019t just get it back, there is nothing to come back for, only evil remains, there is no evolution anymore. So no, Hitler, Stalin and all others who killed more as several dozens of living beings, they will never incarnate again. Each action create certain energy, this becomes part of us, it can heal us or poison us, according to this energy quality. Evil in huge amount destroy irrevocably goodness - main soul energy, after some point soul must leave for own safetyness. Without soul, no incarnations, no future, no evolution, just burning out in very unpleasant place. ",

The elements of which our body is made belong to the cycle of Nature; and as for our soul, it's possible that it might return to limbo, until it gets an opportunity to reincarnate itself.\"\u200b\u200b Most Historians agree that Table Talk from 1941 - 1944 is genuine. I personally do not believe Hitler\u2019s soul has reincarnated yet. His soul will reincarnate eventually. But not necessarily on this planet. The universe is a big place. But his soul is eternal like every other soul. There is no death. Only change from one form to the next.  \u200b\u200b ",
