            "answer_text": "People seem to be talking it up. What I consider more mind-blowing, in this era of progress and wealth and science, is how completely horrible it was. So horrible, it created an era of great authors, who wrote soul-crushing tragedies, such as Les Miserables , or Oliver Twist. Factory work became a thing, alongside Urbanization. This period actually started up before the beginning of the industrial revolution, in the early 17th century. What was horrible about it, was the conditions for the workers. Workers suffered extremely harsh hours, no rights, and small pay. If you lost a hand to one of the dangerous machines while working frantic hours, there was no compensation; you\u2019d become a beggar and likely not survive the winter. If you avoided being crippled immediately, the repetitive labor was sure to cripple you in the long run. Even if you kept steady work, what would you have to show for it? To sleep in a room with 15 other people, drinking polluted water, suffering malnutrition and plague. Cleanliness used to be common in Europe, bathing was not irregular. But soon polluted water got so bad, that even nobility stopped bathing, and Asian cultures write about how badly Europeans stank. It wouldn\u2019t be until after World War 2 that the urban poor started bathing again. Conditions were so bad, that about 50% of kids died before they turned 16, despite all the claims of economic growth. And now let\u2019s talk about child labour\u2026 Children worked in factories for similar hours to adults, but for less pay. Like adults, they\u2019d be punished for mistakes, as far as being imprisoned if they were late for work, just as a slave would. The other punishments mightn\u2019t be worse, but they certainly sound it. They included such things as beatings, waterboarding, nails being pounded through the ears, and being placed in chains, suffering the indignities of a slave. Worse still, these were the lucky ones. If you were unlucky, you\u2019d become a chimney sweep, from the age of about 4, and be traded between master sweeps like merchandise. When you got too old or too big, you would be fired, and become a street urchin unable to earn a living. Out of the charity of their hearts, master sweeps made sure to under-feed children, so that they could continue their work. Why would people put up with such slavery? Why were conditions so harsh? Because the cities were filled with the poor and destitute. Lives of prostitution, begging, and petty crime to survive. This period of slavery and torture went on well into the Victorian era, by which points such things as workhouses were invented simply to deal with the masses of poor. A workhouse was, in some cases, meant to turn a profit\u2026 but usually it was purposefully designed to have meaningless work, and to intentionally be a miserable place no one would want to go. As a side note, the Irish potato famine got so bad, that all the workhouses were filled up, and American slaves sent money to help the Irish, a million of whom died in it. No matter how bad conditions got, there was always a worse case. I mention how bad it was in the cities, and during the famine, so you might look to the country to hope things were better. They were not. In the period of urbanization, rents skyrocketed, in Ireland and in Britain. There are accounts saying that bony farmers could not drink the milk from their cows, nor eat the pears from their trees, because all had to be sold so as to pay these rents. By these means, farmers were forced off their ancestral lands, which were converted to sheep or cattle pastures, or other things considered more economical by the landlords.  But what is most mind-blowing of all, about the industrial revolution? Let us consider the life of a serf, before the period of urbanization, those semi-slaves tied to their lands. The serf owned his own house, he farmed his own fields, paying a tithe to the knight who protected his land. Yes, his land, the land his great grand father had before him, the land his children would inherit. He owned livestock, and could make a profit off his farming, perhaps using those profits to open an inn or a mill for his village. Indeed, the serf were skilled in several trades and enterprising, as he had no farming to do in the winter, and little in the summer. His diet consisted of what he and the village produced, or what could be gathered. Brown bread, fish, vegetables, meat, honey, beer, and boiled water. His teeth are in good condition, his body strong and healthy from the life of farmer. And of course, he would bathe every Sunday.  Between the serf, and the common man in the industrial era\u2026 I leave it to you to work out which is preferable, and who the slave is. ",

            "answer_text": "In the space of only three hundred years, from about 1675 to 1975, how the world lives changed more than in the previous 10,000 years. Back when settlements first began, you would walk a few miles and be in total wilderness. In fact, the first settlements were near reliable, easily-gathered food supplies, such as emmer wheat at Catalhulyuk. Beer was invented near there! When Jesus was alive, he would have been able to function in a society either 1,000 years earlier or later with only a few adjustments. Even as late as 1500 CE, he would have been able to function. Today, however, the situation has radically changed. Starting, as I said, about 1675 Britain developed steel and iron production, canals, railroads, and substantial long-distance trade; China to the UK (for tea, porcelain, and silks) is not a short distance even today. The steam engine was the key driver of this change; it powered factories, railroads, and ships. There were, of course, many other people and nations contributing, but the UK was the key. What started as a few hundred or thousand tons of steel production yearly is now almost 2 BILLION tons! The industrial revolution also benefitted from the intellectual revolution. This brought about, among other things, effective medicine, radio, electricity, refrigeration, telephones, and the internet. So in a little more than 300 years the Industrial Revolution changed how almost everyone on the planet lives. ",
