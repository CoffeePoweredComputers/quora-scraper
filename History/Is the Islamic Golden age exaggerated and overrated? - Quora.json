Indian mathematics \"Samhitas and Brahmanas[edit] The religious texts of the Vedic Period provide evidence for the use of large numbers. By the time of the Yajurvedasa\u1e43hit\u0101- (1200\u2013900 BCE), numbers as high as 10^12 were being included in the texts.[2] For example, the mantra (sacrificial formula) at the end of the annahoma (\"food-oblation rite\") performed during the a\u015bvamedha, and uttered just before-, during-, and just after sunrise, invokes powers of ten from a hundred to a trillion:[2] Hail to \u015bata (\"hundred,\" 10^2), hail to sahasra (\"thousand,\" 10^3), hail to ayuta (\"ten thousand,\" 10^4), hail to niyuta (\"hundred thousand,\" 10^5), hail to prayuta (\"million,\" 10^6), hail to arbuda (\"ten million,\" 10^7), hail to nyarbuda (\"hundred million,\" 10^8), hail to samudra (\"billion,\" 10^9, literally \"ocean\"), hail to madhya (\"ten billion,\" 10^10, literally \"middle\"), hail to anta (\"hundred billion,\" 10^11,lit., \"end\"), hail to par\u0101rdha (\"one trillion,\" 10^12 lit., \"beyond parts\"), hail to the dawn (u\u1e63as), hail to the twilight (vyu\u1e63\u1e6di), hail to the one which is going to rise (ude\u1e63yat), hail to the one which is rising (udyat), hail to the one which has just risen (udita), hail to svarga (the heaven), hail to martya (the world), hail to all.[2] The solution to partial fraction was known to the Rigvedic People as states in the purush Sukta (RV 10.90.4): With three-fourths Puru\u1e63a went up: one-fourth of him again was here. The Satapatha Brahmana (ca. 7th century BCE) contains rules for ritual geometric constructions that are similar to the Sulba Sutras.[21] \u015aulba S\u016btras[edit] Main article: \u015aulba S\u016btras The \u015aulba S\u016btras (literally, \"Aphorisms of the Chords\" in Vedic Sanskrit) (c. 700\u2013400 BCE) list rules for the construction of sacrificial fire altars.[22] Most mathematical problems considered in the \u015aulba S\u016btras spring from \"a single theological requirement,\"[23] that of constructing fire altars which have different shapes but occupy the same area. The altars were required to be constructed of five layers of burnt brick, with the further condition that each layer consist of 200 bricks and that no two adjacent layers have congruent arrangements of bricks.[23] According to (Hayashi 2005, p. 363), the \u015aulba S\u016btras contain \"the earliest extant verbal expression of the Pythagorean Theorem in the world, although it had already been known to the Old Babylonians.\" The diagonal rope (ak\u1e63\u1e47ay\u0101-rajju) of an oblong (rectangle) produces both which the flank (p\u0101r\u015bvam\u0101ni) and the horizontal (tirya\u1e47m\u0101n\u012b) <ropes> produce separately.\"[24] Since the statement is a s\u016btra, it is necessarily compressed and what the ropes produce is not elaborated on, but the context clearly implies the square areas constructed on their lengths, and would have been explained so by the teacher to the student.[24] They contain lists of Pythagorean triples,[25] which are particular cases of Diophantine equations.[26] They also contain statements (that with hindsight we know to be approximate) about squaring the circle and \"circling the square.\"[27] Baudhayana (c. 8th century BCE) composed the Baudhayana Sulba Sutra, the best-known Sulba Sutra, which contains examples of simple Pythagorean triples, such as: (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (8, 15, 17), (7, 24, 25), and (12, 35, 37),[28] as well as a statement of the Pythagorean theorem for the sides of a square: \"The rope which is stretched across the diagonal of a square produces an area double the size of the original square.\"[28] It also contains the general statement of the Pythagorean theorem (for the sides of a rectangle): \"The rope stretched along the length of the diagonal of a rectangle makes an area which the vertical and horizontal sides make together.\"[28] Baudhayana gives a formula for the square root of two:[29] \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3\\cdot4} - \\frac{1}{3\\cdot 4\\cdot 34} = 1.4142156 \\ldots The formula is accurate up to five decimal places, the true value being 1.41421356...[30]\" Shushutha wrote a textbook of surgery and medicine. Islam just copied it. Algebra, the place notation and zero were invented by Aryabhata in Aryabhata Born \t476 CE prob. Ashmaka Died\t550 CE He wrote a textbook for his daughter called \"Leelavathi\", his daughter's name. Beejaganitha is the name of Algebra in Sanskrit. Baghdad ruled that there was no relation between cause and effect. So you can judge islamic science, which is wholly imaginary. Where is it said?
