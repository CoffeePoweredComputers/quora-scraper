            "answer_text": "Sort of. They were, but the only one left is the pyramids. The original seven wonders were a sort of bucket list, or the original \u201cn things to see before you die\u201d list written by a Greek author who talked about the most magnificent things in the world as he knew it, which was limited to the Mediterranean and Mesopotamia. So aside from the pyramids at Giza, which we still have, the others are attested to by other authors, so we\u2019ve got confirmation that they were real as well. The only one which is a little fuzzy is the hanging gardens of Babylon. They\u2019re an odd case because, while a couple of other Greek sources mention them, no Babylonian or other Mesopotamian sources do. We\u2019re still not entirely sure what they were (probably some sort of ziggurat-like artificial garden), and one could even legitimately suspect they never existed in the first place. ",
