            "answer_text": "Very little. There's three main ways scholars came to that conclusion.  First, they looked at people in societies that are hunter-gathers or even semi-settled farmers to get an idea of what past human groups may have done. Those results were all over the spectrum, but many of them didn't have a clear concept of \"marriage\", which is fundamental to the idea of long term monogamy. Some societies show short term monogamy, couples setting up together and breaking apart, while others didn't. You can never be sure these societies really serve as an accurate representation of past humans, but the evidence from them suggests monogamy, especially in the sense a modern person thinks of, was rare.  The second way is looking at near human apes. In this case, that's largely bonobos and chimps. Bonobos are the closest, and their sexual system is non-monogamous, as is the one for chimps and even more distantly related apes. I believe the closest known to have monogamous pair bonds are lemurs, though I'm not entirely sure.  The third way is to look at our bodies. Species that have monogamous pair bonds tend to have certain physical features and traits, and species with other systems tend to have other features. When looking at humans, we seem to have a number of features that suggest our ancestors were not monogamous. Of course given the complexity of any human society we're not slaves to biology in any sense, but that does suggest that monogamy is not a \"fixed\" behavior.  I took most of these arguments from a controversial but interesting book, \"Sex at Dawn\", which you should read if you'd like more details. I'd also suggest reading some of the criticism of that book, for the sake of balance.  ",

            "answer_text": "No, rather the opposite; there's good genetic evidence which points to our ancestors being polygamous.   We know this because of sexual dimorphism - the relative sizes of male and female bodies.  More specifically because in other species with high degrees of polygamy, such as the great apes to give a very related example, males are much larger physically because they are essentially fighting other males for access to multiple females.  The fact that we still see this in humans implies  a polygamous past over very long periods of time. It's far more long-standing social convention which has dictated our modern society be monogamous, than any genetic factor. ",
