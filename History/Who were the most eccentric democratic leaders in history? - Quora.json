            "answer_text": "Henry A. Wallace, who was FDR's Vice-president, during his third term, could be called somewhat eccentric, at least in the eyes of his critics. He was Secretary of Agriculture before he became vice-president, and worked to decrease hunger during the Depression both here and abroad. He was very liberal and some even accused him of socialist or communist leanings, because he tried to end the exploitation of farm workers in South America by the giant corporations that practically owned those countries. He was also very interested in mystical subjects and personally very shy, which is unusual for a politician. However, it was his benign attitude towards the Soviet Union, which many saw as a potential adversary, that caused him to be removed as Vice-president and replaced by Harry Truman in 1944. ",

If you read Catch-22, you\u2019ll remember Major Major Major Major who would only see you in his office when he was out of it. Well, this President wasn\u2019t much different. At any rate\u2026 One thing that could apparently get [him] to expend some energy was curtains. In the wake of his attempt to appoint an attorney general being rejected by the senate, [the President] removed the cord from the Oval Office anteroom curtains and started tying it in knots to relieve stress. Other times he would buzz his staff in over and over and hide behind the curtains when they came in. There are sources that state his preferred hiding space was actually under his desk. Whichever the truth was, there was clearly more going on than the taciturn persona conveyed. \u2026 and that, my friends, was \u2026  \u2026 \u201cSilent\u201d Calvin Coolidge. 10 Obscure Eccentricities of Famous Politicians - Toptenz.net ",
