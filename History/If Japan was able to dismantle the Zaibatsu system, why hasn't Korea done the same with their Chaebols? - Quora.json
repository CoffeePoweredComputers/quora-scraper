            "answer_text": "First, I'm not sure how the OP defines \"dismantling the zaibatsu system,\" but zaibatsus are still around and until recently, more powerful than any Korean chaebol.  They're weaker than they were pre-WWII, but are still far more powerful than most Western conglomerates as far as the daily lives of consumers is concerned. That being said, I have a few theories as to why chaebols haven't separated further: Executives like power, and they get power and money by controlling larger companies.  They don't have much incentive to separate.  This fact is true of the majority of Western companies.Even if they did separate, the current owners (often the founding family) would just own all the pieces: they would have to sell to diffuse power, and they're not going to do so.Korea is significantly smaller than Japan, so large companies need the global market to grow.  This means that breaking up chaebols risks losing dominance: they would lose brand unity and bargaining power.  It would probably would be considered an anti-Korean act in Korea, and thus a death sentence for a politician's career.Chaebols compete with each other, and I can't think of a significant monopoly.I doubt a breakup would happen anytime soon.

            "answer_text": "The premise of this question is wrong. Japan disbanded the zaibatsus under US occupational authority that is after getting defeated in WWII. So it was foreign authorities that did it. Korea did pull the plug on a few chaebols due to reforms demanded by the IMF in 1997 to get aid. The most famous of the channels that collapsed was Daewoo. Hyundai broke up because of family feud between sons of Jeong jun young with each son taking chunks of it. The chapbooks that emerged became even more competitive such as Samsung and LG. It takes a lot of political courage and good sound economic reason to break them up. The bigger issue with Korea is to stop acting as if it is beholden to them as if it was in the 60s and 70s back when the country desperately needed funds via exports to get it out of poverty. This just causes bad business practices to fly and laws not being properly enforced. ",
