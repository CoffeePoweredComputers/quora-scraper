            "answer_text": "Mostly, A very high volume of people considered Adolf Hitler, as the Hero of Germany for his many good or bad deeds ( for the world and Germany itself). But there are many other names also, who can come in the list of German Hero: Arminius: Arminius was the Prince and Chieftain of the Cherusci tribe. He was a chieftain of the Germanic Cherusci tribe who is best known for commanding an alliance of Germanic tribes at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in AD 9. Modern historians have regarded Arminius victory as Rome\u2019s greatest defeat. Karl Plagge: Plagge had a great contribution to his land. According to historian Kim Priemel, the success of Plagge\u2019s rescue efforts was due to working within the system to save Jews, a position which required him to enter a \u201cgrey zone\u201d of moral compromise, and Plagge always insisted \u201cI am not a hero\u201d.
