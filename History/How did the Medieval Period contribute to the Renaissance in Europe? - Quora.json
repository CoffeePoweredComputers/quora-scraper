            "answer_text": "Well during Medieval Times life was pretty bad. The main way of life was of course peasantry and serfdom. Typically there was no thought beyond day to day tasks. The Church was the center of everyone\u2019s life and there was no questioning it\u2019s authority. This all changed after the Buboninc Plague during the late 1300\u2019s into Early 1400\u2019s. During the Plague people looked to the Church for answers but they were given little to no solutions since the Church didn\u2019t actually know. This lead to people to begin to doubt the Church and since so many were dying there was no real resisitence to the doubt. As time went on people had developed a school of thought called Humanism which had began to deeply appreciate human kind and living life. They had realized that life was too short worrying about a being that may or may not have existed( people all still believed in God just didn\u2019t focus on him slightly as much at this time). They expressed admiration towards humans through Art which is what we think of the Renaissance. The Renaissance went beyond that even to relegion. As stated before people had begun to doubt the Church and wanted reform of it thus the Protestant Reformation. The Renaissance even continued to the 1500,1600,and even early 1700\u2019s when Scientific Revolution and Age of Enlightenment flourished. So overall the Medievel Period contributed to people realizing their lives were not so great and begin to think for themeselves. ",

            "answer_text": "It provided the basis and foundation for the Renaissance. Many people think the Middle Ages (roughly 500\u20131400AD) was some black pit of history where the world almost ended. In reality, while Europe was indeed suffering in the power vacuum created by the fall of the Roman Empire, there were bright patches along the way that enabled the Renaissance to occur. Universities started popping up around 1100AD. Before this, the Church controlled education and it did a fair amount to enable Roman and Greek knowledge to live on. However, it concentrated education in the hands of very few. Around 1100, Universities in Bolgna, Italy, Oxford England and Salamanaca in Spain opened their doors. While they were not the way we think of a University, they opened their doors a bit more freely and suddenly anyone with a brain and some desire could get a quality education and move up in the world. By 1500, those 3 had grown to 39 Universities all over Europe. This allowed more citizens entry to education and with more education for some, the entire populace gets smarter. (IE: A 5th grader today would probably be in the top 1% of intelligent people on earth 1000 years ago.) Trade, while growing slowly also allowed old ideas to become new again in Europe. The muslim world and the near and far east held their knowledge and grew and flourished with it while Europe struggled. Once Europe grew and was able to support navies and armies trade began to flourish. While the Crusades were awful campaigns in general, one of the byproducts of them was trade and the flow of information and knowledge. The Muslim world was probably about 1\u2013200 years more advanced than Europe in 1095 at the onset of the Crusades. By 1300 they were neck and neck. Medicine, math, engineering and other subjects that the Byzantines and Muslims had kept alive after the fall of Rome began to flourish. The truth is, that while the Middle Ages get a bad rap and the Renaissance gets all the glory, the Middle ages paved the way for the Renaissance. All the advances in the Renaissance were not monumental leaps forward in thinking, but solid steps taken from where the Middle Ages left off. ",
