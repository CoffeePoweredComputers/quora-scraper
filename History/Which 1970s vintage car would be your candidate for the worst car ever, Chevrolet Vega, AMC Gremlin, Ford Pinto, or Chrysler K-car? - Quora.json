            "answer_text": "The K car was a 1980s car. Chrysler\u2019s 1970s entries might be the Duster or Dodge Dart but those were fairly solid for the time. I owned two Pintos and a Gremlin. Neither of these cars will be remembered as aesthetic masterpieces nor will they ever be examples of advanced engineering, but they were both pretty affordable and for the time, reliable and easy to fix. Few cars from the 1970s, especially smaller ones were much of a safe bet beyond about 70,000 miles. I didn\u2019t own my Gremlin for long, but I did drive my 1976 Pinto for a number of years. I loved the car as far as one can love a $250 car with more bondo than real metal! I often drove it instead of my 1984 Fiero because it was usually more reliable. My best friend owned a Vega. That was, hands-down a much worse car. It was perhaps slightly more modern in styling and features, but was of very poor quality. The infamous Vega aluminum engines were nightmares for oil leaks and burning. All this being said, I would like to offer my first car as a possible contender for the worst car ever. It was a 1976 Chevy Chevette. By outside appearances, it was a pretty stylish little car and fairly lightweight given the times. However, I have owned fewer cars with worse quality. Everything on that car seemed to be broken or about ready to break. It had a lot of cheap plastic parts. Nothing seemed to work well on the car. The heater and defroster rarely put out enough to even keep the window ice free. The engine was anemic and burned oil. The car had worse acceleration than a buffalo and didn\u2019t get great gas mileage for something that small and lacking in power. The Chevette had almost no redeeming qualities except that it was cheap. A lot of people bought them, and I suppose some might have even liked them. I did not like mine. ",

            "answer_text": "The Chrysler K-Car really doesn\u2019t belong in this era, and it actually was not that bad of a car. Basic, yes, but there were many, many variants built off of the K-Car architecture including the first minivan. They were not known for being unreliable. The AMC Gremlin was a sort of stopgap measure to get a car to compete in the economy class in the early 70\u2019s. It was basically an AMC Hornet with the rear trunk lopped off. They were quirky, odd-looking cars but were fairly popular at the time. They had a pretty bullet-proof straight six engine and were actually fairly powerful. Poor weight distribution made them somewhat tail-happy especially on wet pavement, but they were not bad cars for the era. The Ford Pinto was very basic, with a somewhat agrarian but reliable 4 cylinder engine. The interior was somewhat cramped other than the 2-door wagon that was offered. They have acquired a bad reputation among some but they were tremendously popular, reliable transportation in their time. The only negative was a fairly big one, they could explode in a rear end collision due to poor placement of bumper bolts, which pierced the fuel tank. This was corrected with a recall, but the damage was done. Ford still built Pintos for nearly a decade afterwards, though, and they sold well so the poor reputation is only in hindsight. Then, we get to the Chevy Vega. What a piece of crap. Pretty styling, much more attractive than any other economy car available in the US at that time, a lot of promise, sold quite well in the beginning before the problems started to become obvious. But wow, what problems the Vega had. Poor build quality, plastic pieces just falling off or breaking inside, they\u2019d rust sitting on the dealer lot new waiting to be purchased. The engine was horrible, so was the transmission. So, the worst car out of this bunch would be the Vega. I don\u2019t know about worst ever, but it was an awful car. ",

            "answer_text": "The K-car can be excluded completely from this lineup. It wasn\u2019t offered in the 1970\u2019s\u2026 I knew several people who owned Gremlins, including my brother. Despite their quirky appearance, they were solid vehicles, which were very reliable, comfortable and economical. The Pinto was mechanically a pretty decent little car, with a reliable engine and transmission, in both the 2.0 and 2.3 liter formats. The interiors used the same build philosophy of many other larger Ford cars, and were reasonably quiet and heavy feeling. Aside from the infamous gas tank issues, it wasn\u2019t a bad little car. The Vega however, was pretty bad. While under development from GM, the Vega\u2019s subframe had a tendency to crack away from it\u2019s mounts to the car body. The front end would literally fall off of the car. GM fixed that prior to production, but it was known to have notable body flex and high NVH (noise, vibration and harshness). The biggest nail in the Vega\u2019s coffin was the legendary linerless aluminum engine, which would only last for 25,000\u201340,000 miles, before it would start using oil and smoking. The process for honing the cylinders and exposing the impregnated silicone was an extremely poor idea, which resulted in tens of thousands of Vegas ending up in the junk yard after only 3 years. The Vega is by-far the worst of the ones you\u2019ve mentioned\u2026 ",

Out of the other three, I'd take the Gremlin out of the ranking because it doesn't have a particular fatal flaw, discounting style, like most candidates I'd think of. I'm tempted to say the Vega is worse than the Pinto, because the safety problem with the Pinto was eventually fixed while the reliability problems of the Vega really weren't. Out of other American cars of the era, GM cars with diesel engines, the Bricklin SV-1, and the Chevy Chevette deserve consideration, and numerous English cars like the Reliant Robin, Morris Marina, and Austin Allegro are all also terrible. There were a lot of lousy Japanese and Germam cars at the time but at least those were generally reliabile. If ranking was open to everything, the Reliant Robin would win worst, but that's more because it's a stretch to call it a car in the first place. ",
