            "answer_text": "That entirely depends on which nation issued it. United States victory medals are cheap due to their non-affiliation to any one person, much unlike the British and their territories who inscribed the medal with the recipient\u2019s name, rank, and regiment (typically). Smaller nations such as Belgium, Cuba, Greece and Portugal will have a higher value due to their relatively small numbers. Siam, I would argue, is the most valuable since only 1,500 were ever issued. Unfortunately, Victory Medals are heavily reproduced now since World War One is \u201cin vogue\u201d. That said, there is not a very high market for these as opposed to Iron Crosses or the Croix de Guerre. The United States, Italy, and France alone make up over 6,500,000 Victory Medals ever issued.
