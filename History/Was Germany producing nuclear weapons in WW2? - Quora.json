            "answer_text": "There is some evidence that they were. The question largely revolves around how much credence you give to various fragmentary eyewitness reports and documents that have made it into the public realm in the present day. Most who answer the question in the negative point to Werner Heisenberg, who was probably the most well known of the top German scientists of the era, though not the one most likely to have produced a nuclear weapon.  Werner Heisenberg, German Nuclear Physicist and Pioneer in Quantum Theory. For most of the war years he was the face, and sometimes the top civilian administrator, of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute (KWI), one of the major centers of nuclear physics research and development in Germany. The thinking goes that he basically played cat-and-mouse with Hitler and the rest of the top Nazis during the war and, by means of very subtly overstating the difficulties involved, succeeded\u2014if barely\u2014in convincing the dictator and his henchmen to look elsewhere for a war-winning superweapon. This romantic perspective is most fully realized in Thomas Powers\u2019 book Heisenberg\u2019s War. Although Powers is a highly skilled writer and his tome is an excellent and informative read, I do not share his conclusions. Rather, I am convinced that another book by Rainer Karlsch, Hitler\u2019s Bombe, probably has the fundamentals (though not the entirety) of the real story.  German Writer, Professor and Researcher Rainer Karlsch. Heisenberg's War: The Secret History Of The German Bomb: Thomas Powers: 9780306810114: Amazon.com: Books Amazon.com: hitler's bombe: Books Briefly, I believe this because Karlsch\u2019s determined archival research targeted several areas that were largely if not entirely overlooked by previous writers on the subject. The first of these was the Kremlin. Russian archives had rarely been open to any Westerners following the end of WWII and the onset of the Cold War, and they have once again been largely closed off following the rise of Vladimir Putin. But for a decade or so in the wake of the collapse of the USSR, they were accessible\u2014well, they were accessible compared with what they had been previously, let\u2019s put it that way. In any case, Karlsch uncovered a number of top secret Soviet intelligence reports that described not only a more involved Heisenberg than his defenders have it in the present day, but also evidence of some kind of nuclear weapons tests just weeks before Germany collapsed and surrendered. These were said to have occurred near Ohrdurf and apparently involved some kind of prototype of a small, boosted fission weapon. Karlsch is frequently the subject of much derision by physicists and nuclear industry types who like to nitpick his layman\u2019s understanding of bomb physics, but I have never seen any of these critics address the real issue central to his thesis, which is the quality of his documentary sources and whether they are reliable. A quick glance at his curriculum vitae will readily demonstrate that he is certainly not any kind of crank or fringe figure. Wirtschaftshistoriker Rainer Karlsch Karlsch\u2019s work was good enough to attract the interest of Mark Walker, generally considered to be one of the top US authorities on WWII Nazi German nuclear efforts. The two subsequently collaborated on the excellent article, \u201cNew Light on Hitler\u2019s Bomb\u201d, basically a Cliff\u2019s Notes overview of Karlsch\u2019s book with a few additional details that can still be found behind a subscriber wall on the Physics World website.  Union College History Professor and Writer Mark Walker. Karlsch also uncovered a number of provocative papers from the estate of Erich Schumann, who was the head of the heereswaffenamt\u2014the German Army Weapons Bureau\u2014from 1934\u20131944. As one of the top physicists in all of Germany, he was also Werner von Braun\u2019s PhD advisor, and yet Schumann, unlike his lieutenant scientists Kurt Diebner and Walter Gerlach, for some strange reason was not among the top German brains captured at war\u2019s end and interned at the Farm Hall estate in England as part of Operation Epsilon. I have never read nor heard any kind of adequate explanation for this apparent glaring oversight by Allied intelligence, though in fairness it should be noted that he was not the only prominent scientist who fell through the gaps in the Allied net as it settled over Germany at war\u2019s end. Erich Schumann (Wissenschaftler) \u2013 Wikipedia This is the English translation of his German language Wikipedia page. Excerpt from the Declassified Transcripts of Secretly-Recorded Conversations at Farm Hall, August 6, 1945 Along with this are three documents relating to an apparent superbomb test detonation at Rugen Island, near Peenemunde on the Baltic Sea coast, in October, 1944. These are: Luigi Romersma\u2019s lengthy and detailed mid-1980s article in the Italian juournal Defensa (Defense). Romersma was a highly credentialed and respected 20th century journalist who counted Mussolini and Werner von Braun among his personal acquaintances. He also met Hitler on more than one occasion.The \u201cZinsser Affidavit\u201d, the sworn testimony of Luftwaffe pilot Hans Zinsser, who told his American intelligence interrogators about the 1944 test, which he claimed to have witnessed from an He-111 that he was piloting in the area.A British newspaper article, also from October 1944, titled \u201cBerlin Silent for 60 Hours\u201d. As of this writing I don\u2019t have the piece in front of me and so I don\u2019t have the name of the newspaper, but it is cited in Joseph Farrell\u2019s book, Reich of the Black Sun, and when I get a moment I will dig it out. The point being that this article might provide corroboration for the nature of the 1944 test being some kind of nuclear weapon, because an EMP\u2014electromagnetic pulse\u2014would surely be a logical explanation for the sudden crash of most or all of the telephone lines in operation in the German capital at the time. (A dissenting commenter on one of my other answers pointed out that no similar widespread telephone failure was reported in the towns that were nearest to the American \u201cTrinity\u201d test near Alamagordo, New Mexico, in July 1945. The closest of these was around 35 miles from the blast, whereas Berlin is about 120 miles from Rugen Island.)Naysayers will also usually resort to some variation to the effect that the Germans (and the Japanese) could never have done it because just look at the size of the factories and facilities in the Manhattan Project. Since there wasn\u2019t anything of comparable size in either Germany or Japan, well then. No fissile material, or at least, not nearly enough of it, and therefore, no bomb. The reasons for questioning if not discarding this thesis are many, and have to do with the apparently almost airtight secrecy surrounding the end of war German projects, along with possible greater than expected progress toward a functional reactor (notably in the \u201cG Papers\u201d, summaries of Diebner\u2019s work for the HWA at Gottow, Germany) and also the possible existence of more efficient methods of producing fissile material than were used in the Manhattan Project.

            "answer_text": "No. Nor were they close to getting one for several reasons. The project was starved for resources because it was not taken seriously by the high command who were blind to its potential. Instead resources were shunted into the V-2 project. The atomic research was dismissed as \u201cJewish Science\u201d and valuable personnel were drafted into the army. Others left because of disgust with Hitler\u2019s racist policies. Also their supply of heavy water was destroyed by a British special forces operation. Operation Gunnerside Besides their research was taking them into a blind alley. By the very end of the war, the Germans had progressed from horizontal and spherical layer designs to three-dimensional lattices of uranium cubes immersed in heavy water. They had also developed a nuclear reactor design that almost, but not quite, achieved a controlled and sustained nuclear fission chain reaction. During the last months of the war, a small group of scientists working in secret under Diebner and with the strong support of the physicist Walther Gerlach, who was by that time head of the uranium project, built and tested a nuclear device. At best this would have been far less destructive than the atomic bombs dropped on Japan. Rather it is an example of scientists trying to make any sort of weapon they could in order to help stave off defeat. No one knows the exact form of the device tested. But apparently the German scientists had designed it to use chemical high explosives configured in a hollow shell in order to provoke both nuclear fission and nuclear fusion reactions. It is not clear whether this test generated nuclear reactions, but it does appear as if this is what the scientists had intended to occur. . . . why did they not get further? Why did they not beat the Americans in the race for atomic bombs? The short answer is that whereas the Americans tried to create atomic bombs, and succeeded, the Germans did not succeed, but also did not really try. Nazis and the Bomb \u2014 NOVA | PBS Heisenberg, one of the scientists working on the project, was shocked that the Americans succeeded where his team failed. His claim of having deliberately sabotaged the project for humanitarian reasons appears to have been self-serving. The 10 German scientists were held at Farm Hall in England. The facility had been a safe house of the British foreign intelligence MI6. During their detention, their conversations were recorded. Conversations thought to be of intelligence value were transcribed and translated into English. The transcripts were released in 1992. Bernstein has published an annotated version of the transcripts in his book Hitler's Uranium Club: The Secret Recordings at Farm Hall, along with an introduction to put them in perspective. A complete, unedited publication of the British version of the reports appeared as Operation Epsilon: The Farm Hall Transcripts, which was published in 1993 by the Institute of Physics in Bristol and by the University of California Press in the US. The Farm Hall transcripts reveal that Heisenberg, along with other physicists interned at Farm Hall including Otto Hahn and Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker, were glad the Allies had won World War II. Upon hearing that the Allies had succeeded in creating atomic bombs and had dropped them in Japan, Hahn was distraught: he was a mass murderer. After calming him, the German scientists speculated how the bomb was made, Heisenberg decided that they must have obtained a critical mass of uranium-235, which would require an industrial scale effort. Then he attempted to estimate the weight of the critical mass \u2014 his solution was several orders of magnitude too large. He told them that he had never contemplated a bomb, only an atomic pile to produce energy. The morality of creating a bomb for the Nazis was also discussed. Only a few of the scientists expressed genuine horror at the prospect of nuclear weapons, and Heisenberg himself was cautious in discussing the matter. In his book Alsos, Samuel Goudsmit states that the German scientists were willing to work for the Nazis to develop an atomic weapon, and attributed their failure to scientific misconception. Paul Lawrence Rose argues in Heisenberg and the Nazi Atomic Bomb Project: a Study in German Culture that Heisenberg is intentionally misleading in his report of the atomic bomb project in order to protect his own reputation.
