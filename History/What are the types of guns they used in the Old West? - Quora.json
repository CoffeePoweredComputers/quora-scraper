            "answer_text": "All types available, Western men would use anything that they could lay hands on that would shoot\u2026 Here are some of the most common arms borne by these pioneers, according to my reading, I\u2019m no expert, just an interested layman.  Here\u2019s an assortment of revolvers, from the Colts Single-Action Army on top, to the Smith and Wesson top-breaks on the left, to the Remington Army on the bottom right, ALL these guns rode in belts, pockets, holsters and saddle-bags from the Dakota Territories to California, protecting many a cowboy, soldier and shopkeeper when the nearest lawman was days ride away. Then, the long guns.  These are Sharps \u201cbuffalo rifles\u201d large caliber single shot heavy weapons designed for hard-hitting long range accuracy, they decimated the huge herds of wild Bison that once carpeted the prairie. Here,  the .44 Henry, the rifle the Confederates called \u201cthat damn Yankee rifle they load on Sunday and fire all week\u201d \u2019cause it held 15 rounds in the tube mag under the barrel. Another, different lever action, the Spencer,  also introduced during the War Between the States, was commonly used in the West, the cartridges loaded into a tube, the tube into the butt of the gun. it threw BIG bullets, too. Probably the MOST famous rifle, sharing the appellation of \u201cgun that won the West\u201d with the Colt\u2019s Peacemaker,  is the Winchester lever action carbine \u201csaddle gun\u201d, so called because many a cow puncher and travelin\u2019 man had one attached to their saddle.  This short rifle fed, protected and was no doubt a comfort to many a Western settler. There were many more types and models of guns used in the Western lands, shotguns,   hideouts and cut-downs    These last not terribly accurate , but how precise you need to be to plug some cheating sonofabitch across a poker table?

            "answer_text": "What are the types of guns they used in the Old West? What is missing in depictions in film and literature of old West guns is their great variability. Typically, a Hollywood film would have the viewers believe that all handguns were Colt peacemakers and all rifles were Winchesters (usually 1873 or 1892 models). This depiction is quite wrong. There were guns from many more manufacturers than just Colt and Winchester; there were many more firearms manufacturers than there are in today's marketplace. Cap and ball pistols and rifles were used alongside metallic cartridge weapons, and many metallic cartridge weapons started out as cap and ball only to be changed over to the newer technology via a trip to the gunsmith. There were often probably as many single-shot, metallic cartridge firing rifles as there were repeaters. Of course, this changed over time, what you would see in the 1870s would be different from what you would find in the 1880s and \u201890s. All this variability is homogenized and lost via the limited weapons in the prop man\u2019s armory. ",
