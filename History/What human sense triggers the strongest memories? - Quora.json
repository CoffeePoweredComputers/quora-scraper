            "answer_text": "You catch a whiff of pumpkin pie, school glue, newspaper, or fresh-cut grass and suddenly you\u2019re immersed in a flurry of vivid memories, often from your childhood. What is it about smells that can trigger memories so strong and real it feels like you\u2019ve been transported back in time? It\u2019s known as \u201codor-evoked autobiographical memory\u201d or the Proust phenomenon, after French writer Marcel Proust. In his famous novel In Search of Lost Time, the narrator dips a madeleine cookie into a cup of tea and is transported back into time as long-forgotten memories of his childhood come flooding back. Indeed, research shows that odors are especially effective as reminders of past experience, much more so than cues from other senses, such as sights or sounds. One reason this might be has to do with the way your brain processes odors and memories. Smells get routed through your olfactory bulb, which the smell-analyzing region in your brain. It\u2019s closely connected to your amygdala and hippocampus, brain regions that handle memory and emotion. The close connection may explain why a scent might get tied to vivid memories in your brain, and then come flooding back when you\u2019re exposed to that particular odor trigger. As noted by Psychology Today: \u201cInterestingly, visual, auditory (sound), and tactile (touch) information do not pass through these brain areas. This may be why olfaction, more than any other sense, is so successful at triggering emotions and memories.\u201d Odor-Cued Memories Tend to Be Stronger, More Emotional, and from Earlier in Life Before reaching your thalamus, smells first wind their way through other regions of your brain, including areas controlling memory and emotion. So with scents, you have all this extra processing even before you have conscious awareness of the scent. Your body also contains far more receptors for smells (at least 1,000) than it does for other senses, like sight (four) and touch (at least four). What this means is you can discern between many different types of smells, even those you may not have the words to describe. Taken together, this makes odor-cued memories particularly poignant and different than other memories. In one study of older adults, for instance, the participants were given three cue types (word, picture, or odor) and asked to recall memories triggered by the cue. It turned out the odor-cued memories tended to be older memories from the first decade of life, whereas those associated with verbal and visual information were from early adulthood. The odor-evoked memories were also associated with \u201cstronger feelings of being brought back in time\u201d and had been \u201cthought of less often\u201d than memories evoked by the other cues. Separate research also revealed that both young and old adults were able to recall more than twice as many memories when they were associated with an odor, which according to researchers provides \u201cevidence for substantial olfactory cuing that is remarkably intact in old age.\u201d Smells Can Trigger Traumatic Memories, Fears It\u2019s not only positive associations and memories that are brought back by different odors. For instance, odors are known to induce physiological arousal and trigger trauma-related flashbacks. They\u2019re also thought to play a role in triggering disturbing memories in people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Intriguingly, a mother\u2019s fears may even be passed on to her children via scent. In one study, female rats were conditioned to fear the smell of peppermint before they were pregnant. Later, the rats\u2019 pups were exposed to the peppermint scent along with a scent of their mother\u2019s reacting to the peppermint odor. The newborn pups learned to fear the smell even when their mothers weren\u2019t there, after just a single exposure. However, when activity was blocked in the pups\u2019 amygdala, a region of the brain that processes emotions, including fear responses, the pups did not learn to fear the peppermint scent. So it seems that, via scent, \u201cinfants can learn from their mothers about potential environmental threats before their sensory and motor development allows them a comprehensive exploration of the surrounding environment.\u201d The impact of scent on fear was so strong that some of the rats tried to plug the tubing to stop the scent from coming in, a habit that the researchers plan to study further.
