            "answer_text": "Short Answer: He Didn\u2019t When Justinian ascended the throne the Byzantine/Eastern Roman Empire was the last remaining citadel of Roman values and traditions. West Rome had all but collapsed due to barbarian invasions and raids, and several barbarian kingdoms had established themselves in Italia, Gaul, and Iberia. Now the Byzantines were very well off, they had sufficient infrastructure, an army that could defend it, a standard of living better than any other kingdom in Europe (In the 6th century), and an abundance of wealth due to mercantilism and vast resources in its many provinces. But Justinian wanted more.  The territory highlighted dark orange, Byzantium at the beginning of Justinian\u2019s reign (. Territory highlighted in light orange, Byzantium at its greatest extent under Justinian (565 A.D.). Justinian still held on to the idea of a grand Roman Empire, wishing to bring back the glory to the fallen empire, and become an Augustus, an emperor over the entire Roman Empire. Thus began the grace period of the 530s, where Justinian successfully invaded and conquered several kingdoms like the Ostrogoths and the Vandals. Using the wealth and resources of the Byzantium Empire he retook large swathes of land once occupied by the real Roman Empire. In the midst of his conquests, Justinian published his Corpus juris civilis, more well known as the Justinian Code, a readjustment if not a restatement of Roman law(s). Now that I\u2019ve explained that Justinian not only retook a large amount of the former Roman Empire, including Rome itself, and reinstating Roman laws, you may wonder why I don\u2019t think he actually reformed the Roman Empire? This was temporary. Because of the great amount of soldiers and gold it cost to not only invade these territories, but defeat the organized enemy armies, and then occupy belligerent provinces. Then came the disaster of the 540s, disease, famine, and an economic depression. Following Justinian, each Emperor was handed down a larger mess. The amount of resources used to take all this territory was too much for Byzantium to handle, they simply couldn\u2019t cover the cost of all this new territory. Such amenities and luxuries the average Byzantine once indulged in 525 A.D. was a rarity for one in 570 A.D. Within a few decades a large amount of the territory they had fought hard to gain was lost, even territory they had held before Justinian\u2019s conquests. From this point on, the Byzantine Empire only fell further and further from the spotlight it once held.  Look at how much territory has been lost and what is being contested in only 35 years. Although you can claim he reformed the Roman Empire, all he did was create a basis for a large portion of western law, and what would be the longest Byzantine screw over in their history. ",

            "answer_text": "Justinians project was to reconquest all the Roman provinces and he was able to conquest several territories of the fallen western Roman Empire ( Italy, Africa,South Spain and all the Mediterranean isles ). The Mediterranean Sea come back to be a Mare Nostrum under the Roman rule . Just a few kms of the Mediterranean coast were outside the Justinians territory ( French Coast ). Anyway his conquest and reunification of the Roman Empire was something extremely ephemeral . During his conquest he ended the empires resources and he had to let without a sufficient protection the Balkan border and so weak that numberous Slavic tribes took advantage of the opportunity to enter in the Balkan provinces . De facto in the Balkan area in a few years all the rural areas became Slavic indipendent territories , being the imperial authority limited just to the fortified towns were the Roman cititzenship were obliged to go to live to save themselves by the savage Slavic tribes .A few years after the death of Justinian began the Lombard invasion of Italy. These were the same Lombards that arrived to Italy some years before into the Justinian\u2019s cavalry to fight against the goths . ",
