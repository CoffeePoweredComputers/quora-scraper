            "answer_text": "\u2026 not that would be \u201cgrammatically incorrect,\u201d but only that would be ignored or considered dispensable due to the substantial disintegration of both literacy and of primary and secondary \u201clanguage arts\u201d (i.e., rhetoric standards) education since then, especially within the last decade or so. The lessening\u2014and it persists increasingly even at the post-grad and classic professional levels\u2014of ability to speak and write in standard English, or even to think and solve problems rationally, continues apace even at this time. And the advent of Internet is largely the reason by its increasing \u201csaturation\u201d of the (especially more youthful) population with poor as well as \u201cnews speak\u201d journalism as models of acceptable rhetoric. Whereas erstwhile learners of English from the media would for the larger part have known from schooling that news and media speak is not Standard English for social and academic circles, their present counterparts, with rare exception, do not. In short\u2014and this has much to do with the disintegration of family cohesiveness beginning in the latter half of the previous century\u2014the social egalitarian and familial pressure for poor English rhetoric in place of good (including syntax, diction AND grammar) has grown to be greater today than ever. And faulty research in some supposedly \u201cleading\u201d liberal universities (think, \u201cBerkeley\u201d for one) has even encouraged the trend. Would you believe there could have been a time when the expectation of K-3 (then called grammar school) primary \u201cgrammar\u201d proficiency would have matched that of high school graduates of today! Or a time when no American could have believed a time would come when the U.S. was not among the world\u2019s very few nations having a literacy rate of 100%. \u068d\ufffdi\ufffd\ufffd ",

            "answer_text": "A hundred years ago really is not that long\u2026 ST. MIHIEL ATTACK CLEAN CUT VICTORY OF AMERICAN ARMS It has seemed worth while to describe in some detail the rather intricate battle plans of the American Army for the reduction of the St. Mihiel salient because, from the American side, the description of the plans amounts almost to a description of the battle. Seldom in history has a military operation been carried out more precisely according to program. At 1 o\u2019clock on the morning of September 12, the Artillery preparation began with one terrific burst of fiame from many hundreds of guns, French as well as American, ranging in size from the 75\u2032s to the great seacoast guns, some as large as 4oomm in caliber, which, firing from railway mounts, carried harrassing fire to rail and road junctions as far behind the German lines as St. Benoit, Mars-la-Tour, Gorze, Confians and even Metz. (Stars and Stripes, Vol 2 No 5, Friday March 7, 1919) Assuming the OP would accept the Stars and Stripes as a representative sampling of \u201cproper\u201d English grammar of the time, there\u2019s very little to really take note of here. There seems to be more use of auxiliaries (e.g. it has seemed instead of it seemed\u2026) some less common vocabulary (e.g. salient is used as a noun, it is most commonly today an adjective like salient details) perhaps some dialectical differences (to program vs. to plan) and some stylistic things (we would probably prefer 1:00AM vs. 1 o\u2019clock) this is recognizably English as we speak it today. There are grammatical rules that some would say are obsolete today. For example, are you the one (who) I spoke to? vs. are you the one to whom I spoke? This purposely hits two - who vs. whom and not ending sentences with a preposition. Both of these are not very common in standard spoken English (i.e. the first question is far more common than the second). However, within the realm of formal written English these are still \u201crules\u201d to follow. I think that\u2019s what the OP will find - things in less common usage, but not necessarily grammatically incorrect. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a grammar of English what I know. Interrogative pattern has to be \u2018aux. verb+S+V infinitive\u2019 in modern English, like \u201cdo I have to take that?\u201d. However, if you ever learned any other language like Spanish, then you could find it is not in there. In Spanish, \u2018S+V\u2019 is declarative, and simply if you put them conversely like \u2018V+S\u2019, then it is interrogative. No aux. verb needed. This was same in English in the past. I forgot when it was like that, but as time went by, some people started to use an aux. verb when they make interrogative sentences, and it spread and generalized slowly. Plus, I don\u2019t know if it is correct, but I think I heard the pattern \u2018causative verb+O+O.C. as infinitive\u2019 was \u2018causative verb+O+O.C. as to infinitive\u2019 in the past. ",
