            "answer_text": "What are some examples of petroglyphs?  I have some barely a half-mile from my house (see above). They are on a hill which was a volcano some 30 million years ago. In fact, the Anasazi have scattered their art all up and down my rift valley. Albuquerque, NM has a park on its west mesa; the mesa not only hosts the park, the iconic volcanoes of Albuquerque slowly erode there too.  Petroglyph National Monument protects one of the largest petroglyph sites in North America, featuring designs and symbols carved onto volcanic rocks by Native Americans and Spanish settlers 400 to 700 years ago. These images are a valuable record of cultural expression and hold profound spiritual significance for contemporary Native Americans and for the descendants of the early Spanish settlers. Petroglyph Park encloses an estimated 25,000 images, I chose my three favorites: A bird-man?   I am not afraid of snakes\u2014even rattlers!  I have no idea what the human figure is doing. This last one is facing east across Albuquerque towards the Sandia Mountains. Personally, I think the mountains which form my backyard fence are better, but I have not found any petroglyphs there. This is on the website linked below, but the warning is worth repeating. It is important to know that there are no petroglyph viewing trails located at the visitor center. Each of the petroglyph viewing trails is a one-mile to a 6.5-mile drive from the visitor center. If you visit, carry at least one bottle of water. Wear shoes, not sandals or flip-flops; you won\u2019t like the walk otherwise. Sunglasses are de rigueur (really necessary), and a hat is a good idea. I stuffed a handkerchief in my jeans too as it can be handy. Anything else you need to know about petroglyphs or the park will be on the website. I am surrounded by ancient art and love it!
