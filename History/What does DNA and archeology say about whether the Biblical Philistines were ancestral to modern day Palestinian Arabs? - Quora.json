            "answer_text": "Both archeology AND genetics say, NO. Philistines were but a part of so called Greek diaspora, as the Greek colonized all coasts of the eastern Mediterranean sea and the Black sea. To be precise, Philistines were genetically nearly identical to the modern southern Greece population. Archeology shows Greek building style and decorations, Greek ceramics, and Greek race of pigs. Now, Palestinian Arabs are ARABS. Arabs are, as their name testifies, colonizers who arrived from the Arabian peninsula to the Levant as Muslim aggressors in the eighth century. They forced their religion and culture on the indigenous populations which became assimilated or else were forced out. Prior to 1948, when British imperialists left the land, the term Palestinians could be only referring to the Jewish population, as opposed to the Arab population of \u201cPalestine.\u201d Arabs here insisted they are Syrians, and the land is a part of Syria. Only 1965 in the term Palestinians was invented by the KGB as a subtle weapon against Israel. The main Genetic pool of the \u201cPalestinians\u201d consists of Arabian peninsula population, Syrian and trans-Jordanian arab population, and lesser amounts of Muslims from Balcan and Turks. ",
