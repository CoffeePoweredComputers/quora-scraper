            "answer_text": "No. There hasn\u2019t. There is no \u201cpure\u201d communist, Libertarian, Socialist, or any other \u201cism\u201d based society either. And in fact, it would be accurate to say that all of the attempts to categorize economic policy along lines that agree with these various theories, will fail. Economics is not a science. It tends to be more of a philosophy, and the bottom line is that in a broad sense, economics always, inevitably, becomes a contest over how the \u201cwealth\u201d of a nation should be distributed, and the people with the most power, always, inevitably, set the policy that distributes wealth. When you realize this basic, immutable, truth, you realize that whatever \u201cschool\u201d of economic mythology is being promoted, exists only to legitimize the policies of the people with the power to control the distribution of wealth, to their benefit. It doesn\u2019t matter one bit whether the economic policy in a society is called \u201ccapitalism\u201d, or any other \u201cism\u201d. If the net result is that a small percentage of the people control the majority or all of the wealth, the fact is that there is no difference in any of them. We in the US cringe in horror at the alleged slavery of \u201csocialism\u201d which, according to the people making economic policy in the US, turns the working class into slaves for the privileged class. Yet in the US we have the same economic outcome, 85% of the wealth owned by less than 10% of the population, and we are told that the magic \u201chand of the market\u201d\u2026\u201ccapitalism\u201d\u2026 has divinely decided that the wealthy are worthy of reward, whereas the rest of us are useless, lazy, unproductive, slackers. All of the classic economic \u201cisms\u201d are either invented by the powerful to convince the rest of us that the rich are not responsible for the fact that everyone else is poor, or they are \u201cblueprints\u201d for making wealth distribution more equitable, which have been hijacked by the wealthy class and manipulated by them to achieve the same result.

            "answer_text": "The question is built on false premise. Capitalism does not have a prescribed formula. Capitslism does not have founding fathers, who expressed exact founding principle; no, Adam Smith wasn't one. Capitalism does not have prearranged rules. Therefore the question of purity is not applicable. It is like asking if there has even been a pure love. What capitalism is in this case? It is a set of patterns in human economic behavior that emerges (spontaneously) under certain conditions, just like love. You can observe the the said patterns of behaviour. You can form a judgment on how prevailing certain patterns are. But there is no question of purity in any of that. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as capitalism, Scotty, a name devised by Communists for natural trading. People do naturally trade and in doing so make everyone richer - I sell something to you for money that enables me to buy something I value more, while your decision to buy it shows that it was worth more to you than the money you gave me for it. Then it allows some people to specialise because they can use the money they get to buy food and other things they want and specialisation add enormously to efficiency. Governments stand back and only make rules that prevent \u2018cheating\u2019 , false measure and advertising, monopoly and so on. So this simple, natural system allows everyone to choose what they want , making their own decisions and adds to wealth at every step, although what it does not do is spread that wealth evenly and governments often have progressive taxes in an attempt to spread out the benefits of the system. Simple, flexible and just vastly better than the artificial systems that have been suggested as alternatives. But also not \u2018capitalism\u2019, please, which is no more real than psychotherapy or phrenology but natural trading. ",

Chile wasn\u2019t voluntarist as a principle, but conservative military competing with socialists.Objective standards of justice - well it was a civil war. Not too bad in this respect, but not an ancap, so no common law.Defensive use of violence - Pinochet killing or imprisoning socialist resistance revolutionaries.Competitive authority - Pinochet overturning populist socialist govt was a defensive use of force. Pinochet not being elected was even better. But tax is not voluntary. He is afterall a conservative.",

There has never been a time when there was not a purely capitalist society, though the society will have been a small part of a larger society. Except when constrained by geography (on an isolated island, for example) no society has a natural or absolute boundary. Patterns of human association and interaction (societies) constantly change and are in layers and components of other patterns. Some of them are purely capitalist, most are not. ",
