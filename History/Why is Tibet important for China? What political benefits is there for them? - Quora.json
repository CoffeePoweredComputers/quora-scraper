            "answer_text": "The person asked for political benefits, a lot of other people already answered the obvious answers like minerals, the plateau giving China a height advantage over India, and that if another country is to have Tibet, they would essentially be looking over the vast plains of central China. However, there is one very important thing they miss out on. Rivers. Yarlung Tsangpo River, Nu River (\u6012\u6c5f, which becomes Salween River), Lancang River (Mekong River), and the numerous tributaries of the Ganges and Indus River all orginate from Tibet.  Now being upstream for all of these rivers is a very good thing. Why? Because we can build dams! The Zangmu dam is a very good example, by building it and the four other dams in its program, China essentially has control over the water flow in Northeastern India.  There are also other dams located in the Yunnan province for rivers originating from the autonomous region such as the Nuozhadu Power Plant that controls the Mekong River. These dams would come in real handy when tensions grow, because China can open up the dam and flood whatever is downstream at any time. Another thing China can do with these rivers is to redirect them somewhere else to completely cut off the water supply of a certain region. In one sentence, China is essentially the water god for the countries downstream. However, the real reason why Tibet is important for China is because there are 3.2 million Chinese people living there. We don\u2019t give up our own people and 1.23 million km2 of our land. ",

            "answer_text": "The actual main reason, that is rarely mentionned in the other answers, is the \u201cblue gold\u201d : water. Did you know that Tibet is called the \"Water Tower\" of Asia ? China has an ever growing problem with tap water. Over half of Chinese water sources are so polluted that they do not fit human contact. See : Rural Water, Not City Smog, May Be China\u2019s Pollution Nightmare (from the NYtimes). As such, the chinese authorities are desperate to have \u201cclean water sources\u201d.  In March 2015, the vice major of Beijing, Li Shixiang, said that \u201cthe city faced a severe water crisis\u201d and that it lacked 1,5 bilion of cubic meters of water each year. Actually, at least a third of the Chinese population, living in the northern areas of the country, have an average water disponibility of about 525 m^3 per year, which is, according to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) close to shortage level. [1] What about Tibet then ? Well, it is the source of the greatest Asian Rivers, such as the Mekong, the Brahmaputra, the Salouen, the Yellow river and the Yangtze. And anybody controlling the upstream of a river controls the river. So of course, in order to manipulate its owns essential water sources, China has to keep Tibet. Since countries such as India also have issues with tap water, the area is even more important, as it is a strategical spot to influence the whole region.  Add to that the zone produces a lot of hydraulical energy (for example : Chinese engineers propose world's biggest hydro-electric project in Tibet), which is renewable (a big plus for a country terribly suffering from pollution) and quite simple to obtain. You can then easily deduce why Tibet is that important for the Chinese. (Of course there are other reasons, especially old political rivalries, but water control\u2019s importance is getting more and more relevant). [1] SRIDI Nicolas, \u00ab Chine.
