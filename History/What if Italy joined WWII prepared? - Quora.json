Ok, let\u2019s suppose Italy could stock more military supplies, do an intensive training to its troops, substitute its portion of totally outdated equipment with state of the art airplanes, trucks, guns and MGs between September 1939 and June 1940 (date of entry into the war). Much likely Italy would have performed a bit better in the first year of its war, up to mid 1941, but this wouldn\u2019t have changed the overall course of events. Then, in the following years, there wouldn\u2019t have been much difference compared to the actual history that we all know. Why that? Because Italy did not have the natural and industrial resources to sustain a prolongued war. No oil, little coal, little metals and an industrial base that was totally inadequate to the war. Because what was state of the art in 1940 was no longer sufficient in 1941. The hundreds of Fiat CR.32 biplane fighters available in 1939 would have been substituted by hundreds of Fiat CR.42\u2026. biplane fighters! Totally outdated in 1941. The Italian designed and manufactured AA and anti-tank Ansaldo 90/53 gun was as good and possibly even better than the famed German 88 mm gun (over 20.000 made). It was introduced around 1938\u201339. Italy could manufacture only 539 up to July 1943, when production stopped. Because an improved training of the army would not have basically changed the overall low level of its general staff and class of higher officers. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all the WWII would have started way later, probably not before 1943. I think it was not possible to be prepared for the 1939 because of the industrialization process that occurred in those days. Italy had very light industrial tissue, able to build rifles and bullets in high quantity but unprepared to to support a mechanized army with tanks and planes. Even with better industry there still would be several problem about outdated war ideas, dumb officials and questionable leadership, but at least the nation would not be obliged to fight the war with tanks equipped with weapons unable to pierce enemy\u2019s armours. The aviation could probably have counted on planes created for the war instead of steal and use all the planes owned by privates. The fleet would be probably being the same, the navy was quite prepared, and the foot soldiers were trained enought, but probably thay would have better equipment. ",
