            "answer_text": "Petroglyphs are drawings on rocks, often found in caves. They are a representation of an image and only that image, such as the cave paintings like those found in the Lascaux Paleolithic renderings, found in a complex of caves in the Dordogne region of southwestern France, because of their exceptional quality, size, sophistication and antiquity. Estimated to be up to 20,000 years old, the paintings consist primarily of large animals, once native to the region. Hieroglyphics are carvings, more often, in rock that have phonetic elements, approaching a written language. Egyptian and Maya hieroglyphs are examples of this phenomenon. ",
