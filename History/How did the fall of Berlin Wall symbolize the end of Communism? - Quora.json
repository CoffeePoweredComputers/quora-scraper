            "answer_text": "One month before the \u201cfall of the Berlin Wall\u201d something rather eerily happened in Leipzig, the second biggest city of East Germany besides Berlin itself: Tens of thousands of people gathered outside the St. Nicolas Church near the main city square with nothing but candles in their hands. Many parents left their children at their grandparents\u2019 home for they did not know whether they would return that night alive. The Communist regime had amassed thousands of troops in the streets and no one knew whether they would shoot on their fellow citizens like the Chinese Communists did so ruthlessly on the Tiananmen Square a few months before - killing thousands. So strong was their will to live in freedom that they willingly risked mass slaughter. The Communist police troops, however, were utterly unable to lift their arms against people demanding nothing more than their own freedom. On that 9th of October 1989, Communism had surely failed. Brought down by common citizens with nothing more than candles in their shaking hands. That night was the last chance of the Communist regime in East Germany to once more put down protests with murderous force - but they didn\u2019t, because they knew their time had come where all the lies and oppression would no longer save Communism. There had to be more bloodshed in Romania for example because a ruthless dictator there clung to his miserable life. But it was made utterly clear for all of human history, that a system that is dependent on imprisoning its own people will never succeed if there is still a beacon of hope elsewhere to which those people may aspire to.

That was the true symbol: freedom to flee and regimes forced to change or having to see their country emptying out. Communist dictatorship desperately need to control the freedom of movement of their citizens. Cuba, with its \u201csea wall\u201d (island location) still has very stringent laws against \u201cillegal exit\u201d. \"The Penal Code also defines the crime of salida illegal del pa\u00eds, \"illegal exit from country.\" Under Penal Code Articles 216 and 217, those caught trying to leave the country without the permission of the government can be fined or imprisoned for up to three years if they have not used violence and up to eight years if force or intimidation is used. In cases where passenger vessels or airplanes are hijacked, the charge is usually one of pirater\u00eda, \"piracy.\" Under Penal Code Article 117, piracy carries a penalty of up to 20 years imprisonment, or a possible sentence of death if there is loss of life or risk to the lives of others. In the past three decades, thousands of Cubans have been imprisoned for trying to leave the island without permission. In 1994, illegal exit prisoners were thought to constitute the largest category of political prisoners in Cuba. In 1990 alone, there were 335 inmates convicted of illegal exit serving time in a single prison in Havana, the Combinado del Este.\" Repressive Laws in Cuba abusing human rights Salida Ilegal - Illegal Exit Cuba ",

            "answer_text": "While the idea of an Iron Curtain stretching from the Baltic to the Mediterranean worked well as an image, the actual Berlin Wall captured the reality of the fault line between two competing economic and governance systems. When the Wall was finally breached on the evening of November 9, 1989, the changes that had been underway in Europe ever since the Polish elections of Solidarity or the openings in fence between Hungary and Austria now had a powerful visual proof that did indeed become the symbol for what turned out to be an irreversible process. When I went to Berlin to witness the balloon release timed to occur on the 25th anniversary of that event, two of the participants on the stage in front of us were Lech Walesa from Poland and Mikhail Gorbachev. They bore testimony to the fact that the end of the Berlin Wall was one of the seminal events of the 20th century. The Cold War didn\u2019t end that night, but the fault line lost its power to divide and we entered a time of rapid transition that culminated in the dissolution of the Soviet Union two years later.

Although Cuba is still around. China is not even trying to act communist anymore. They have become a capitalist oligarchy. If you are referring to Marxist communism then it has not fallen, in fact the amount of followers has increased due to less anti-communist sentiment in the U.S. as well as the general cold war scare effect being done. Communism will never end, especially in the minds of the people. ",

In my opinion it was a rather unperfect version of socialism. I think it should stand more for the idea, that you cannot rule a folk against it\u00b4s will. In the end, even if it takes long years, the people will get rid of the small amount of people who bully their own folks to get rich. This is a much more hopefull message. ",
