            "answer_text": "This map is busy, but it shows all four of Columbus\u2019s voyages. He hit many Carribean Islands, but also stops in Central America and South America. There are probably good reasons for focusing islands, such as easily conquered and contained, good harbors, or water sources visible from the ships. Contrary to common teaching, Columbus never thought he landed in India. Using his sailor\u2019s sextent he knew he was on the 20-degree N. Parallel, and he knew the Indies of SE Asia were also on the 20-degree N. Parallel. When it was later found out that he had located a new continent, the \u201cold\u201d Indies were renamed the \u201cEast Indies\u201d, and Columbus\u2019s Indies were renamed the \u201cWest Indies\u201d. They are still called that today.  ",

Columbus wanted to go to Asia and he thought he had landed in the West Indies, as he called them, some islands close to Cipangu (Japan). Columbus never sat a foot on the American continent, but he attracted other explorers, which would then lead to the discovery of a New World.  Martin Behaims globe from 1492 shows the world of Columbus. ",
