            "answer_text": "Racism is pervasive in the United States. There is no part of the country that is unaffected. There is no good measure of racism, so there is no way to rank cities according to the racism of their people. An effect of racism that can be measured, though, is residential segregation. The Social Science Data Analysis Network has developed a measure of segregation called the dissimilarity index, which they have calculated for metropolitan areas, rather than cities. The metropolitan area with the greatest residential segregation is Gary, Indiana. This includes not only the (mostly black) city of Gary but also a number of (mostly white) suburbs in northern Indiana. The metropolitan area with the lowest residential segregation is Jacksonville, North Carolina, which is dominated by military facilities with little or no residential segregation. Looking only at metropolitan areas with more than 1 million residents, the most segregated is Detroit; the least segregated is Orange County, California. The least segregated with a really dominant core city is Las Vegas. Another answer here mentions Houston, but metropolitan Houston actually has a fairly high dissimilarity index, higher even than Boston, for example, despite Boston\u2019s reputation for segregation.

            "answer_text": "People are not racist. An organization can be racist, \"we will not hire X; fire all Y\". People however can be bigoted and they tend to live with people who look like them and/or sometimes with people who believe like them. Since walking around asking what everyone believes is hard, people go with looks. To be honest everyone is a bit bigoted and discriminate either overtly (with violence) or covertly (with speech and them long glares). We know when we, personally, are out of place in a barber shop OR when someone else is out of place. We know it and feel it and that feeling is the subtle reaction to what we know as bigotry either us imparting to someone or having it imparted it to us. If you have EVER looked at anyone longer than normal because you thought they might be LOST then you are guilty of that subtle bigotry. Most of the bigotry (everyone calls racism because they are daft) that happens in the states is covert. It is speech and looks. Rarely is it violence and when it is usually well it skews heavily one way. Jesse Jackson said it best I suppose. \u201cThere is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps... then turn around and see somebody white and feel relieved.\u201d \u2015 Jesse Jackson The stats are also racist.   Or are they bigoted.One can never be suspicious enough of hate facts... No one is allowed to notice this. There is nothing to see here. ",
