            "answer_text": "Conflicted. Pet ownership is inherently an exercise in narcissism and seeking comfort through animal ownership. While there are numerous aspects of pet ownership that improve human life in terms of lowering blood pressure, reducing depression, and helping people exercise more, it does impart less than wholesome attitudes to the natural world. Capitalism transforms nature into a mere consumer item regardless of the damages involved. And the \u2018puppy farms\u2019 worldwide is proof enough of that. That being said, I\u2019m not much better. I was a volunteer wildlife rescue worker as a kid. I have been bitten by some of the most venomous snakes on Earth. Even have some old necrotic wound scarring to show for it. Didn\u2019t stop me having pet snakes. In particular a stunning diamond python who was my favourite. However how much I doted upon her, snakes don\u2019t see their captivity as a blessing. No matter how much you pretend a snake \u2018likes you\u2019, anthropomorphizing its comparative psychology is part and parcel of the problem. I\u2019ll still rescue a snake, but I don\u2019t desire to keep one as a pet anymore. And I\u2019m not criticising people who do, but the axiological metrics of essentially keeping pets hostage for the sake of only your amusement isn\u2019t exactly the greatest testament to the benign relationship humans should perhaps have for the natural world and all the other animals we share this planet with. It\u2019s also why I don\u2019t completely \u2018gel\u2019 with the concept of zoos. Zoos at least have some forms of utilitarianism behind them, however. Whether it be public education, damage-minimised ecological tourism, or for breeding programs. ",

            "answer_text": "My view is that only animals who have evolved to be pets should be such. For example, dogs have evolved alongside humans to be human companions. Selective breeding has enhanced this effect. Dogs make excellent pets and it doesn\u2019t stress them to be pets. So dogs as pets are fine. Compare this to a Komodo Dragon. Komodo Dragons are wild animals that are also highly dangerous. They don\u2019t form emotional connections to humans, even if adopted at a young age. Further, having a Komodo Dragon as a pet will stress the animal out. Even in zoos they are difficult to manage and remain dangerous. Capitalism commodifies all things, including animals, humans, and the environment. It exploits nature to create profits. The capture of wild animals to be sold as pets can lead to the extinction of that species. And many animals ripped from their natural habitat to become pets die from the stress of it. A communist society would not permit the exploitation of a species and destruction to the environment to create profits.  ",
