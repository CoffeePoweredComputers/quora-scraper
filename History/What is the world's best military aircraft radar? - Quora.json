            "answer_text": "Usually the latest is the greatest, and nothing is better than what is still being designed. The Selex ES-05 Raven AESA radar designed for the new SAAB Gripen E/F promises to match Captor-E in many respects.  What makes a system great is not only the sensor but also the processing power, software and last but not least sensor fusion. The Gripen will have three Selex-ES sensors. The Raven ES-05 active, electronically scanned array radar (AESA), developed by the company's Edinburgh unit, will be the first production AESA to be mounted on a \u201crepositioner,\u201d a rotating mount that gives the radar a \u00b1100-deg. field of view around the nose, I have seen figures of 240 degree spherical being cited in the press but that seems a a bit optimistic.. The Skyward-G infrared search and track (IRST) system (from Nebbiano, Italy) is based on experience with the Eurofighters Pirate IRST and Selex-developed land- and sea-based IRSTs. The fighter also has a new identification friend-or-foe (IFF) system with three electronically steerable antenna arrays, which matches the radar's range and field of view. The three main sensors will cue one another automatically to display to pilots a fused picture of airspace around the fighter; it will also be fused with the Gripens new electronic-warfare system. Finally, sensor data can be shared between Gripens in a flight, or ground control in addition to airborne surveillance platforms via data link at least on par with but probably more capable than the F-35 datalink.

            "answer_text": "I would go with the APG81, the radar of the F35. This radar can simultaneous track and engage dozens of targets with a RCS of 1m out to a range of at least 150km for aerial targets but less so for ground targets. The APG81 can also be used in a ECM role to jam enemy radars. The APG81 was actually able to jam the APG77, the radar of the F22. The APG81 can also use agile beams to avoid emitting in a massive 120 degree cone in front of the aircraft, leaving it vulnerable to counterdetection by passive sensors. The APG81 not only provides SAR but also GMIT capabilities as well. Being designed with APG 77 as a template the APG81 also likely possesses an enhanced capability as a data sharing platform. The older APG77 was able to transmit data at several megabyte per second speeds and receive data at several gigabyte per second. The APG81, being upgraded with many additional advanced features both hardware and software related likely exceeds this ability, allowing lightning fast data sharing to supplement the traditional link 16 and newer MADL; the APG77 actually transmits data far faster than the Link 16 datalink to give ",
