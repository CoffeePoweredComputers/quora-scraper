            "answer_text": "1. On rival Republican candidate Carly Fiorina: \"Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that? The face of our next president? I mean, she's a woman, and I'm not supposed to say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?\" 2. On Hillary Clinton's presidential ambitions: \"If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?\" 3. On the Chinese: \"I'm not saying they're stupid. I like China. I just sold an apartment for $15m. Am I supposed to dislike 'em? People say you don't like China. No, I love them. But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders. And we can't sustain ourselves with that. It's like, take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.\" 4. On Senator John McCain's war record: \"He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.\" 5. On illegal Mexican immigrants: \"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.\" ...And on criticism from CNN's Don Lemon for those Mexican immigrant comments: \"All I'm doing is telling the truth. Someone's doing the raping, Don. Who's doing the raping? Who's doing the raping?\" 6. On what will happen if he wins the US election: \"We will have so much winning if I get elected you may get bored with winning. Believe me. We are going to start winning big league.\" 7. On his solution to the illegal immigration problem: \"I will build a great wall \u2013 and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me \u2013 and I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.\" 8. On the owner of Huffington Post, Arianna Huffington: \"Ariana Huffington is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man \u2013 he made a good decision.\" 9. On rival candidates' electoral competence: \"Some of the candidates, they went in and didn't know the air conditioner didn't work and sweated like dogs, and they didn't know the room was too big because they didn't have anybody there. How are they going to beat Isis?\" 10. And finally, on any \"haters\" out there doubting the man, Trump tweeted this to his five million followers: \"Sorry losers and haters, but my I.Q. is one of the highest \u2013 and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your fault.\" ",

            "answer_text": "There are several things you need to look at to understand Trump and people\u2019s antipathy to him. It is not largely based on present politics but on Trump\u2019s record in business and, to a lesser extent, his amoral personal life. He is an actor playing a part and his script is the election speeches in his campaign. The rallies are the only place he feels comfortable enough to riff on his script, (universal adoration will do that to people) His schedule is a tv actor\u2019s schedule, short \"takes\" and then a recuperative time while the next shot is set. Only a limited attention span is needed and only a page or so needs to be read. His tweets are his way of arguing his points without being face to face with one person or a group which will increase his insecurity because they are not on script. Extemporizing requires an actor to be reactive and flexible and he is neither. Hence the keeping of staff he has expressed dislike for. If you're not in total adoration, he avoids you. He is a fabulist  \u201c 1. a person who composes or relates fables.  2. a liar, especially a person who invents elaborate, dishonest stories. In his business life, lying was par for the course. Often he would tell one party what they wanted to hear and another what they wanted to hear, amalgamate the lies together to make a third lie and when called on it to point at anything else to avoid being cornered which also many times involved a lie. He still does that. Look at most confidence schemes and you\u2019ll see the same pattern. In business, only a few people or a few thousand people heard the lies. Now it\u2019s millions around the world. In international relations blatant lying makes you someone, and the country you represent, unreliable So the next thing you need to understand about Trump is that he is, at his core, a con man with no empathy. Therefore, he assumes that all other people are also con men with no empathy, and every exchange of goods and services that exists in the world is, on some level, a con. Trump assumes every transaction in the world \u2014 between people, businesses, nation-states, even between two different agencies of the same government \u2014 has a winner and a loser, a scammer and a sucker. He believes if you're not ripping someone off, you're getting ripped off.From an economic perspective, this is complete nonsense. Unless there are major information asymmetries or distortions of market power, and often even then, most transactions are generally to the mutual benefit of both parties. Otherwise no deals would ever get made. But Trump \u2014 the man who created a fake university, made promises and then stiffed contractors, some of whom went bankrupt, hired the mob, and filed for bankruptcy six times \u2014 cannot believe this. So he goes out of his way to cherrypick how he sees the world, so that everything does looks like a ripoff, a negotiation based on the disrespect a con man has for his \u201cmark\u201d. Depends what you call negotiating. In some cases, you have no choice and may agree to the negotiation out of weakness or the need to keep cash flow going, if you can. Several people I know have had contracts with Trump. When they presented the bill, he refused to pay, stating the work was not up to his standards. To him, that seems to be a typical negotiation. and several other people I do not know well have told me similar stories about personal experiences they had with him including adding a \u201cTrump clause\u201d, bidding more than full price so they basically got most of the money up front. This worked mainly because with Trump\u2019s reputation he had meant less choice in tradesmen because of others previous dealings. I have heard the story of a banker in New York who dealt with Trump just before he went bankrupt. His argument when the bank said they were going to sue was that they stood to lose more by cutting him loose than by hanging in there with him. They decided to wait. Then he declared bankruptcy. He is non traditional but not in a good way. He thinks nothing of screwing anyone he can. If by negotiating, you mean does he get what he wants and the other guy gets the Bronx cheer, the answer is yes. If by negotiating, you mean does everyone walk away feeling there was a fair compromise, the answer is no. There is such a thing as ethical business practices. When an ethical person negotiates, success usually results in everyone feeling alright about the arrangement. An unethical person knows negotiating techniques as well as their ethical counterpart. These basic concepts are common to many instructional works that teach negotiating. Here\u2019s the real core of Trump\u2019s \u201cart\u2019 of the deal. keep as much information to yourself until the opponent exposes their vulnerabilities.small print is king. Obscure as \tmuch information as possible. Let your opponent commit and do what \tthey committed to do, then offer less for a quick payout, using \toverlooked details to strengthen your position.when a dispute arises, be immediately prepared to sue or countersue based on the small print or implied \tagreement. Rather than spend the money in court, if you wait them out, most will settle for less.discover the needs and fears of your prospect. Balloon the fears and share how you will eliminate the reason for their fears while meeting and exceeding their needs whether it is the true course or not.All of these can be useful tools. But when not entered into in good faith, the positive results are often short-lived and bad things happen to good people. Trump\u2019s modus operandi in the White House shows no understanding of leadership but a continuation of his business persona. So he has a new con, executive orders. Despite what he says about his predecessors use of executive orders, he has signed more executive orders than any President since Johnson. Here\u2019s the con, hold a big ceremony, sign the order, make a great show of doing it with his base and then leave it to go fallow. How long has it been since anybody, except maybe his hand picked rally crowds heard anything about infrastructure? The trillion dollar program? In two years how many of those projects have begun? Have requests been made to city and state governments for needs? My grandkids take the school bus with 40 kids on it over two bridges that were built by the WPA 5 days a week. One of them is now a single lane because it\u2019s too far gone to carry the weight of two vehicles at a time. The county has no money to replace the bridge, the state has enough money for some repairs but the appropriation for a new bridge is years away in the \u201cpipeline\u201d. The big meeting in Singapore? Nothing happened beyond a couple of chat sessions and a big signing ceremony. You can argue Trump\u2019s unorthodox style but I disagree that it\u2019s producing positive results. Verbally beating up on partners who have proved themselves over and over again while kissing up to the leader of country that represents the remains of the ideology I went to Vietnam to fight. I see you\u2019re buying the whole \u201cDeep State\u201d thing that indoctrinators like Alex Jones, Limbaugh and Hannity keep spewing. It\u2019s sad that they have to help themselves by dividing the country. I apologize for the length of this. Feel free to respond but please don\u2019t use the phrase \u201cwhat about?\u201d I think dialogue like this is what will heal our nation and bring us all, as Americans together. That's what I fought for and that\u2019s what I pray for. ",
