            "answer_text": "Plato\u2019s most important works are Apology, Phaedo, Crito, Meno, Theatetus, Parmenides, Sophist, Timaeus, Symposium, Republic. I regard the essential Plato as Parmenides, Timaeus, Symposium, Republic. Aristotle\u2019s main works are Metaphysics, Nicomachean Ethics, Eudemian Ethics, Categories, Prior Analytics, Posterior Analytics, On Interpretation, Politics, Poetics, Rhetoric, On the Soul. Essential to me are Metaphysics, Nicomachean Ethics, Categories. I say the Categories because it is necessary to know it to understand medieval philosophers. Also, what is essential to me just reflects my particular philosophical interest. ",

            "answer_text": "For most people the essential work of Plato is the Republic. You are talking bare bones essential here? Plato\u2019s other dialogues are essential if you really want to undertand him. If you are just beginning to study Aristotle I would find a good book about him. What we have of Aristotle is his students\u2019s class notes. You probably want to read his Ethics and Poetics. His metaphysics and logic may be best learned from secondary sources. Then there is his books on physics, biology and economics\u2014 the guy wrote about EVERYTHING! (The Economics is not about economics, but about keeping a orderly household. We'd have to wait for Adam Smith for actual economics.) ",
