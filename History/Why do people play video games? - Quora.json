            "answer_text": "A dozen different reasons for anyone. Speaking entirely for myself: 1.  They are a wholly different medium, in terms of storytelling  capability. Books offer you a five-course meal you digest over the  course of a very long day, and remember for the rest of your life.  (Assuming the book's good, that is.) Film and TV offer a prepared show  that you indulge in, with no need of input from your end. Gaming offers  the visual stimulation of film whilst still affording you control of what happens during. Depending on the game genre, the things that happen in the game could be said to be happening to you personally. Medal of Honor (2010) offers the best illustration of this, I believe; one of the characters you play has just been rescued (by your efforts playing as a different character), and is awaiting medivac. You see the rest of your team and the Rangers who rescued you desperately trying to keep you alive until the helo gets there. The helo arrives, just as you bleed out. Movies and books have done it previously, but how many have it being you who drives the story with your actions? Even the cold, clinical, impersonal strategy games can get you invested in things, because they move at your command. 2. Boiled down to their very core, a video game is essentially a long series of problems to which you must find a/the correct solution. Sometimes these solutions are simple; sometimes they're complicated. Sometimes they're time-consuming, sometimes they're done in a flash. And sometimes you have something that looks like what you need but actually isn't (in which case you're in for it) and sometimes you get something that wasn't what you expected but works perfectly. I like the challenge of finding the solution - whether it's properly building up an army to defend a Drakken Laser Drill (siege tanks, come on, lots of them) or how to break Old Guard before they hit the lines and wreak their accustomed havoc. 3. Because they're fun, goddamnit. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is that people like entertainment and enjoy being entertained and gaming is an effective way to do that. The longer answer is more personal so your mileage may vary. I would argue that gaming is the most involving form of entertainment that you can find thanks to the added dimension of interactivity.  Above is a shot from Lord of the Rings widely regarded as one of the best fantasy film series ever made. It has huge battles, great character moments, excellent cinematography and a compelling story.  In contrast the above shot is from the game Shadow of Mordor. It has all of the same things as the Lord of the rings movies except you are the one driving everything. You fight the great battles, through the nemesis system you are the one who has great character moments, your actions drive the plot forward rather than just sitting being a casual observer.  Above is a screen shot of Game of Thrones, one of televisions hottest series right now and widely regarded as one of the best TV shows of all time. It is full of violence, sex, intrigue and betrayal in a wonderfully realised dark fantasy world.  Above this is a screenshot of The Witcher 3, it is also a dark fantasy full of sex, violence, intrigue and betrayal except you are often the one doing those things. The world is also wonderfully realised and you can spend hours helping or hurting people however you want.  Here we have The Shining, a horror masterpiece about an isolated man losing his mind in a strange location.  Here we a shot from Silent Hill 2 a game where the player character James Sunderland is an isolated man trapped in a hostile environment slowly losing his mind except the game is able to convey his struggles to the player even better because James\u2019s struggles are also the player\u2019s struggles and the game uses this to create tension in a way a simple movie can not because the movie does not have that level of interactivity. Gaming is able to do things that books, movies and series are not able to do because they all lack the inherent interactivity of the medium. A game can be just as deep as a book since you can happily explore the world at your leisure. A game can be paced at the same pace and have spectacular set pieces just like any movie or TV show but because you are the one doing the things it feels even more impressive. This also ignores the power fantasy, the competitive and social aspects of gaming that once again are something that very few other mediums can do. ",
