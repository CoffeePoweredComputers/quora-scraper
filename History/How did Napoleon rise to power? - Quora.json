            "answer_text": "The eruption of the French Revolution in 1789 created a ton of opportunities for regular soldiers to become great generals and marshals. In 1789, Napoleon had graduated the Ecole Militaire of Paris and was stationed in southern France at Valence. He was in an artillery regiment. After playing and failing in Corsican politics, Napoleon and his exiled family fled to France. In 1793, Napoleon gained great recognition at the Siege of Toulon. He would go on to save the Republic in 1795, and then in 1796\u20137 fought his famous Italian Campaign against the Austrians. Apparently, when he left for his Egyptian Campaign of 1798, Napoleon already had ideas for overthrowing the five-man Directory leading France. He said, \u201cHowever, the fruit is not yet ripe\u201d. Napoleon left Egypt in 1799, and was greeted as a hero in France. He ridiculously overplayed his military victories there and made himself out to be a hero. A few influential French politicians approached him, such as Sieyes, a political writer and activist, and Talleyrand, a diplomat. Napoleon, Sieyes, Talleyrand, and a few others, had several secret meetings regarding their coup d\u2019etat. It was a very secretive affair, and it is hard to find many sources and letters regarding their plan. It was decided that the coup would occur in the 18\u201319 Brumaire (the Revolutionary Calendar), which is 9 November. Napoleon reportedly said, before the coup, that he and Josephine would either sleep in the Saint-Cloud Palace, or face the guillotine. Napoleon tried to bribe as many Directors as he could, including Barras (he took the money). Napoleon\u2019s advantage was that his brother, Lucien Bonaparte, was president of the legislation, known as the council of 500. Lucien tried to tell the council that a insurrection was occurring and that Napoleon was to be placed in power. Basically, his coup was a military overthrow. He walked into the room of the councils with a bunch of tall grenadiers, telling them to write a new constitution, dissolving the Directory and establishing a Consulate. It backfired for Napoleon; the council was enraged and began calling him a tyrant and were going to declare him an outlaw. Lucien immediately jumped down and pointed a dagger at Napoleon\u2019s heart, exclaiming that if he even suspected his brother of being a tyrant, he would strike him. Napoleon\u2019s friend Murat walked in and dispersed the Council. Napoleon narrowly won his coup. Basically, he walked into the room with a bunch of soldiers, and through the military dissolved the Directory and created himself the Consul of France. ",

            "answer_text": "Napoleon exploded onto the French political scene several years earlier in 1795. At the time, Royalist counter-revolutionaries were on the brink of bringing down the current government which only recently replaced the Committee of Public Safety. The Convention, currently governing France, brought Napoleon in to put down the revolt in Paris and restore peace. He did so with swiftness and savagery, bringing artillery into the streets if France and firing upon the mobs. In thanks, the government gave Napoleon what he wanted\u2014control over the Armee d\u2019Italie. Over the course of 1796 and 1797, Napoleon crushed the Austrian and Italian forces in Northern Italy, creating a puppet Cisadane Republic in Northern Italy and securing the Low Countries in the Treaty of Campo Formino. For the first time in since 1792, France was at peace in Europe (although war with Great Britain continued). Napoleon returned to France a national hero for his victories, and the French government, the Directory, was completely reliant on Bonaparte\u2019s armies and the support the people gave him. This put them in an awkward position, as many in the Directory were jealous and fearful of his influence. In 1798, the Directory was more than happy to send Napoleon off to invade Egypt to disrupt British trade. Although the invasion was largely a failure, during his two year stay in Egypt, the Second Coalition was formed and war on the continent continued. France again was on the losing side of the war, and Napoleon rushed back to Paris in late 1799. By now, public opinion was completely against the Directory, and Napoleon got involved in a conspiracy to overthrow it. Napoleon\u2019s soldiers completely surrounded Paris, while his brother Lucien (President of the Council of Five Hundred, France\u2019s lower house) convinced the legislature that a Jacobin coup was occurring in Paris. The Councillors fled into the arms of Napoleon\u2019s soldiers, making them essential prisoners to the General as they gave him complete military control of France. Meanwhile, Napoleon\u2019s co-conspirators convinced the members of the Directory to resign their posts. The next day, the Councillors realised what was going on and tried passing a law declaring Bonaparte an outlaw. Things only stabilised when soldiers under Joachim Murat entered the meeting halls and forced the Councils to adjourn for three months and made Napoleon, Abbe Sieyes, and Roger Ducos leaders of a new government, the Consulate. Napoleon eventually convinced his co-Consuls to effectively go into early retirement, as he controlled the military. By the end of the year, a new constitution was written and Napoleon held supreme power in France ",
