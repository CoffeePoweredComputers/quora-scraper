            "answer_text": "I personally admire Spring and Autumn Period and Warring State Period (i.e. Eastern Chou Dynasty), the former started on fall of Hao City, the latter started on the split of Jin State into Han, Zhao and Wei, but I will put an emphasis on the latter. Warring States Period literally means the era full of clash among states, however, it\u2019s the period for philosophies as well. Liberation of philosophies and thriving philosophers All philosophers had more freedom to develop their own philosophies than other dynasty, especially political philosophies, in Eastern Chou, the philosophers gradually developed Confucianism, Mohsim, Daosim, Legalism etc. Social ladder mobility It\u2019s also the era that every ruler of states urgently needed and relied on philosophers and talented generals, no matter what their social status were, even where they had been born and raised. There are some examples below. Li SiLi Si (280 B.C. - 208 B.C.), born in State of Chu, had been a local administrator in his hometown before he left Chu, however, he thrived and became extremely powerful due to his philosophy, which was favored by Qin ruler. Although the Qin ruler once doubted their loyalties due to their nationalities and planned to deport them all , he eventually withdrew the order because he needed them. Lian PoLian Po, one of the four greatest generals of the Warring States period. He beat Qi and Wei , even repelled the offensives of Qin. He spent most of his lifetime as a Zhao general, however, he was distrusted by Zhao ruler but Chu ruler admired him and wanted him to work for Chu. Lian Po later worked as a Chu general and died in ShouChun, the capital of Chu. In fact, it was common that ambitious philosophers and generals moved from one state to another to achieve their goals in that time. Zhengguo CanalThe construction of the canal shows the extreme endurance toward foreign engineer, Zheng Guo, Han hydraulic engineer, he was once suspected as a spy for Han, trying to undermine the strength of Qin. He wasn\u2019t executed miserably, but he completed Zhengguo Canal, which irrigated vast soil of Qin. The examples above are available on Wikipedia. Dramatic diplomacy Horizontal and Vertical alliances abruptly pop up and heavily favored by most of the rulers because all states were thirsty to elude to be annexed by Qin, they hesitated to obey Qin, or defend together. Horizontal alliance refers to the obedience to Qin.( Qin became extremely powerful and productive due to the reform aligned to Legalism) On the contrary, Vertical alliance refers to union against Qin. The most well known figures are Su Qin and Zhang Yi, they were diplomats of eastern states (Qi, Chu, Han, Zhao, Wei, Yan) and Qin respectively. Such philosophers are known as the very first diplomats in China. Talented military figures In that period, wars were everything, countless talented generals like Bai Qi, Wu Zhi Shu, Wang Jian, Lian Po (mentioned earlier), Yue Yi, Sun Tze (the author of Art of War) pop up. They weren\u2019t all royal members, some of them were born in ordinary families. Some tactics developed then are still used today or last for a long time. Conclusion In the nutshell, I prefer Warring States Period owing to the liberation of thoughts and the thriving philosophers and generals. On the other hand, The rulers respected the outstanding, even surrendered the outstanding. It\u2019s extremely rare in other dynasties. ",

            "answer_text": "Many Chinese are very admiring of the Tang (AD 618\u2013907), especially the years before the An Lushan Rebellion that broke out in 755.  The Kaiyuan Shengshi (\u5f00\u5143\u76db\u4e16), the first part of the emperor Tang Minghuang (Xuanzong), who ruled from 712 to 756, was considered to be the apogee of Tang splendor. During this time the Tang capital at Chang'an was the largest city in the world, with a roughly square city wall with a perimeter of 35 kilometers and a population of over a million. It was an extremely cosmopolitan city, sitting as it did at the eastern terminus of the Silk Road, and people from all over the known world of the day could be found there. There were Nestorian Christians, Manicheans, some Arab Muslims, Indian Buddhists, and even some Jews living in Chang'an. You could encounter Central Asians from as far west as Persia to the easternmost reaches of the steppe corridor, Japanese, Koreans, Malays and more in the great markets.  There was a craze for the exotic that's very clearly reflected in the art and music of the time. Ceramics and statuary often depicted foreign peoples\u2014Sogdians, Persians, Turks\u2014and the exotic animals they introduced, like Bactrian camels. It was during this time that Buddhism really took hold in China, and that Central Asian music, and the instruments on which it was played, took over as the dominant form of music\u2014the pentatonic music that we recognize as \"Chinese\" today. Instruments used in Chinese music still bear names that reveal their foreign origin: the pipa (a borrowed word), the erhu (\"second barbarian [fiddle]\"), the huqin (\"barbarian lute\") and so forth. The three-colored Tang sancai glaze became very popular during this time and these pieces remain very valuable to collectors today. The poetry of the Tang is memorized even today by most Chinese school children in the PRC, greater China, and in the diaspora. Most Chinese can recite at least a couple of famous Tang poems by the likes of Li Bai, Du Fu, Wang Wei, and Li Shangyin. The Tang aristocracy was still heavily influenced by the nomadic Turkic peoples with whom its ancestors had heavily intermarried in the preceding centuries. They still regarded horsemanship and archery as vital arts for men, and early Tang emperors even pitched felt tents of the sort used by steppe nomads in the imperial palace grounds. With its powerful military forces, matching their traditional enemies out on the steppe in the use of horse archery, the Tang were able to extend their power west into Turkestan all the way out to Afghanistan. In 751 scouting parties from the Arabs of the Abbasid Caliphate and the Tang Chinese fought a minor but historically significant skirmish at the Talas River in modern Kyrgyzstan, marking the easternmost point of Arab expansion and the westernmost point of Tang. Tang's military might, however, was dependent on powerful regional generals who commanded personal loyalty from their mostly nomadic or semi-nomadic cavalry forces. This proved to be a serious problem. Tang Minghuang grew infatuated with an imperial consort surnamed Yang, known to history as Yang Guifei (\"Precious Consort Yang\"), who ended up accruing considerable power and influence at court. She helped install her brother, Yang Guozhong, as Prime Minister. Her \"adopted son\" and reputedly also her lover, the Sogdian general An Lushan, also became highly influential at court, and clashed with Yang Guozhong. He rebelled in 755 and effectively brought an end to Tang's splendor. The rebellion was eventually put down in 763, but not before Chang'an had already been sacked by Tangut (Tibetan) forces and the whole country wracked with civil strife. The dynasty survived but never quite recaptured its earlier magnificence. A kind of xenophobia set in in the early 9th century, and foreign influences\u2014especially in the military and in religious life\u2014became very unpopular. ",

            "answer_text": "Lacking in the firsthand experience living in Tang and Han dynasties, I find it difficult to cling to the alleged \u201csweetness and light\u201d of those periods. Our forebears might be credited with the glorious feats that have laid the groundwork for our society, but the elaborate artifacts I saw in the museums cannot conceal the miserable life the commoners led in the past. So, I vote for the last 7 decades since I witnessed the sweeping social changes and therefore I have more empathy with the historical figures living within this period. The two decades after the Cultural Revolution used to be a great challenge to our country in the following respects: Despite the official declaration that the illiterate rate of our country was the lowest in the world, the educational level in less developed regions were rather low. In the early 90s, the malformed fetuses, along with other artificial \u201ccuriosities\u201d\u2014hens with three feet or endangered species, were blatantly exhibited in our third-tier city\u2019s parks. The popularity of such exhibits is a testimony to the public\u2019s lack of education. This is in stark contrast with the current situation: showered with environmental protection knowledge and the respect for the species other than humans, such exhibits have disappeared from the cities. In the past, the paupers living under appalling conditions tended to be debilitated by some fatal illnesses such as cancer and couldn\u2019t do anything about their fates, due to the lack of the social security. With the hygienic and medical standard raised even in the rural region, many epidemics such as pneumonia no longer remain incurable. The mobsters were posing menace to the society in the 90s, when street injustice prevailed in my city. In 1999, a student from my senior high was spirited away after school by barbaric kidnappers, whose abduction led to his funeral held months later near our school. When the Skynet surveillance system was absent, the criminals might get away with felonies committed in secluded areas. The 80s and 90s was the period during which the officials\u2019 power encroached on the individuals\u2019 rights. As a result, the false charges in the 90s led to many hasty executions, with the galling parents of those \u201ccriminals\u201d disgraced for decades. But, with the easy access to the Internet, they can dispense justice with the help of litigious lawyers or netizens. For instance, the imposters in the college entrance exams were promptly found out with the help of Internet. In the 80s, sex used to be a taboo subject. The adultery and participants in the orgies might be sentenced to death. Beyond the persistence of discrimination in certain regions, many once \u201cincomprehensible\u201d behaviors have now been condoned by the public. Even though nepotism and corruption still linger in the local governments, the officials are more adroit in enacting the monetary and fiscal policies, since the central government has given top priorities to the deeds in the economic growth. Therefore, the hyperbole that characterized the officials\u2019 speeches in the 90s has given way to more down-to-earth attitudes. Prior to the founding of the PRC, sexism was rampant and deeply-ingrained in people\u2019s mind, with the traditional Chinese women coerced into accepting their husbands\u2019 arbitrary decisions. In the 50s, the PRC government eliminated the polygamy and encouraged women to participate in almost every field, through which many prominent women exuded their confidence and commanded respect with their self-possessed presence, when their East Asian counterparts were still whining incessantly about the tom cats in their families. Nevertheless, there are also dark sides: the middle class is burning the candle at both ends due to the financial pressure of raising two kids and the progressively aggravated inflation, toiling away to counter the forthcoming recession brought by the trade war and the economic transformations. But overall, as Charles Dickens put it, \u201cIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity.\u201d ",

We all know life can be hard in pre-industrial society, even harder for female since we were (and still are) discriminated and mistreated by male. China is no exception. That means if I have to take a time travel back to anytime in ancient China, my life will be probably as miserable as this: obey my father before marriage, and my husband during married life and my sons in widowhood (\u4e09\u4ece)have little freedom in marriage and divorcecan't recognize a single Chinese characterhave to risk my life to give birthbe sold as a child bride by my own parentsbe drown in the river when I am still a new-born baby since a girl is useless for the family. The gendercide thing, you know.For most ancient Chinese girls, today is almost as good as heaven. And I always remember that a girl should never romanticize the past unless she is sure she would be a princess. ",

            "answer_text": "Han, Tang, Song are generally most admired. Han is the first stable and sustainable dynasty after the first emperor Qin unified China. Although it takes a tyrant to unify China, the same tyranny does not worked for ruling the country at peace time, Han successfully restored the much needed peace and order to a war-torn country, reaching a ideal state of governance during the Wen and Jin Emperor. It was also during the Han rule that Confucianism became the official doctrine, which laid the stone for a 2000 continuous dynasty rule. Towards the end of Han, complacency and decadence set in and once again the country disintegrated and entered the three Kingdom era, only to be unified briefly in the era of Wei and Jin before plunging into chaos of the North and South period. Then Sui came and reunified China in a short-lived period before Tang took over and settle into a longer period of stability and prosperity. The Tang rulers being from minority tribes descent were relatively open-minded to all kinds of ideas and thinking, it is during this period that Buddhism flourished. Imperial examination (invented by the Sui) became the official channel by which the common people can move upward the social ladder and change their destiny. The famous Tang poetry is a testament to this period of flourishing civilization. Then again the cycle of restoration and decadence repeats itself and Tang fell into chaos again, this time due to a weak center and strong regional warlords. Then Song came and reunified the country, Song was relatively weak due to its founding legitimacy and constant threats from the nomad of the north. However, it was relatively opened and relaxed at home. Merchants and Intellectuals were given high status compared to before. The results was a burgeoning of market economy at its infants state and flourishing of Song arts like painting, calligraphy, literary works (Ci) and philosophy (li xue, a product of fusing Buddhism into Confucianism) which is a legacy to this days. Today, Song\u2019s painting and pottery is regarded as having achieved the highest standard and highly valued in the antique market. After Song, China was ruled by Mongol and plunged into \u201cdark ages\u201d (not much to talk about), people were stratified into classes to highlight the nobility of the conquerer. Ming over-threw the Mongolian and restored the much welcomed rule of Han Chinese. However, except for the first few emperors, Ming is largely filthy and corrupted with the notorious emperor\u2019s agents (dong chang) policing civil servants and Mandarin officials (no trust between CEO and his managers), and heavily reliance of powerful and corrupted eunuch (castrated court servant, PA) by useless emperors from mid of the Ming rules onwards. The end results is darkness and a distorted court which strangled the dynasty and see it to its end. Next came the Qing, which is ruled by the Manchus,a minority from North east of China. Manchu contributed a great deal to the expansion of China territory to its max in history due to their warrior supremacy. The Qing also achieved a golden period of rule during the reign of the Emperor KangXi to his grandson QianLong. However, discrimination and a close guard against Han Chinese runs throughout their rule due to their insecurity as out-numbered minority. The Han Chinese has to live with their head down with their tails between their legs. Worst still the Han Chinese were forced to keep \u201cpig-tails\u201d and wear Manchu clothing. The intellectuals were constantly living in fear of prosecution for saying or writing something wrong in the Manchu master eyes, whatever maybe the case. So overall Han with its relatively benevolent and peaceful rule, Tang\u2019s openess to ideas and Song\u2019s relatively relaxed atmosphere producing the most legacy are the most admired. Of the three, personally Song is the most admired for me. ",

            "answer_text": "The Spring&Autumn period.I always see this period as the teenage of China.The history before Western Zhou is somewhat childish, and after Qin dynasty China has grown up as an adult. Besides, there were not so many wars as the Warring States period.Since the soldiers were most from the noble class, the wars of Spring&Autumn period were not as cruel as the later history.Iron and cattles were used to develop agriculture the first time, new lands were reclaimed. The noble class and their rules began to collapse, and the civilians were awaken. There were  hundred schools of thought(\u8bf8\u5b50\u767e\u5bb6)\uff0c which indicates that the atmosphere was quite free. The world view of Chinese came into being based on Confucius,  Laozi, Mozi, et.al.Maybe China was not that powerful or wealthy at that time, just like a teenager. However, it is a hopeful period, everything is new and everyday is different. ",

            "answer_text": "Not as easy to answer as it might seem.Today's Chinese define themselves as, Han Chinese, or, the people of Han. This means the Chinese look upon the great Han dynasty as the one that defines China, the Chinese people, Chinese civilization, and what it means to be Chinese.Yet most Chinese greatly admire the Tang dynasty and its first one hundred, twenty years as a shining Golden Age in Chinese civilization.Tang China was unquestionably a world superpower, at least in its first one hundred and forty plus years before the revolt of Field Marshall An Lushan. Such was the East Asian prestige of Tang China that foreigners flocked to China for commercial trade, religious study, college-level study, establish diplomatic vassal relations, etc. In Asia at that time, China was the place to visit, do business, study, live as emigrants. Tang China was the equivalent of the United States today, a nation that people from the world wanted to go to. But the revolt of An Lushan, once the most trusted man of the Tang emperor, almost ended the Tang. Eventually An Lushan died in two years but his son and later generals kept the revolt alive for another four years before it was finally extinguished. But in the aftermath the power of the Tang was greatly lessened and while its East Asian prestige remained high, it was no longer militarily strong.The Chinese next admire the Ming Dynasty as a period of resurrected Chinese greatness. The early Ming was militarily strong, but not so much nor as successful as Tang China. Still, Ming China re-established itself as the pre-eminent economic, diplomatic, commercial, and military power in East Asia, once again recognized as the center of East Asian civilization.Recently, the Chinese have begun to take another look at the 300 year Song dynasty, which heretofore had been overlooked or given minimal interest because the Song were diplomatically and militarily weak.Chinese historians have begun to acknowledge the first 127 years of Song China as another Golden Age of China in which advancements in high culture, technology, economics, agriculture, maritime shipping, great inventions like printing, paper currency, the compass, et al, and military affairs, outshone the great Tang. Song China at its height in 1100 A.D. was wealthier than Tang China, helped by the quasi-modern economy and the reliance on hugely effective paper currency.Chinese historians have begun to think that the great Ming dynasty was actually a continuation of the Song dynasty at its height, despite a 90 year interruption by the Mongol Yuan dynasty.Chinese dynasties all appear to exist in two halves. The first half of the dynasty is its so-called golden age. The second half marks the start of a slow but inexorable stagnation, decline, then economic and social turmoil and chaos and finally demise.The Song dynasty experienced this fate, although differently.After around 125 years of shining prosperity and culture, northern Asian nomadic invaders, the Jurchen (Qin), overran and occupied some 2/5ths of China, its northern portion. The Song emperor and his government retreated south and re-established the Song in the remaining 3/5ths of China. But this portion of China proved to be the more economically prosperous. Song China re-achieved economic prosperity and existed for another 150 years before being overrun by the Mongols. ",

            "answer_text": "As a Chinese student, I have talked this with many people.First I want to clarify the meaning of powerful.China was quite strong in different aspects in differenttimes. So it is quite hard to say what is period that people most admirable.In Spring&Autumn period(BC770-221), the China was powerful in thoughts.Spring and Autumn Warring States period is a greatly revolutionary era in Chinese Ancient history, the military systems and the military ethical opinions had changed greatly.Way Back during the Spring and Autumn and the Warring States Periods, the contention among the Hundred Schools of Thought created a favourable milieu for the advancement of science and technology.The Tang(AD 618\u2013907),The Tang Dynasty was the most magnificent period in feudal society ,China was very wealthy in Tang, especially in The Kaiyuan Shengshi,Kasier's answer was very good and in detail.The Tang and The Song(AD 618-1279). (Maybe it is quite long...)Chinese art was developed to a historical climax at that time.If you were a chinese, you must heard about Tang poetry and Song Ci,which are shining pearls in the treasure-house of Chinese literature.

            "answer_text": "Kaiser Kuo has already answered this question from an historical perspective. My answer addresses the possibility that the current dynasty, but 70 years old, is a contender for future honors.Though vilified by Western media, the current oligarchy has arguably delivered more 'goods' to the Chinese people than any dynasty in history. Yes, I know; it's 'repressive', 'authoritarian' and 'materialistic': but so was every dynasty in the past 3,000 years. The current dynasty freed the country from foreign invaders and warlords, fed the entire population better than any predecessor, made the streets safe and emptied the prisons and restored China to its accustomed place at the center of the world. That's a good start.For their next act they plan to make China 'stupor mundi': so advanced, so cool, that everyone will come to marvel, offer tribute, and go home enriched and amazed.Let's see how that plays out.

If not for the Tang, I\u2019d probably not even have considered myself Chinese; thus, the Tang dynasty has given China\u2019s greatest contribution to my family. That being said, I also greatly admire the post-Mao \u2018dynasty\u2019 AKA the current CCP-era. Although, my family doesn\u2019t personally benefit due to the fact that we\u2019re living overseas, one still has to give thought to the following: Which other dynasty can boast lifting 500 million people out of abject poverty in a mere 40 years?Which other dynasty can boast having given its population a literacy rate of 96.4%?None but the CCP! Therefore, in my eyes, the current era is admirable indeed! ",

That is because that two dynasties are the most strongist period of china in history. For many younger persons with higher education, they like Ming Dynasty (\u660e\u671d) or the period of Republic of China in Chinese Mainland (\u6c11\u56fd\u65f6\u671f). They are often very active in the internet, making their idea more and more popular. Those people are called Ming Fans, and ROC Fans. In my view, those people are often immature in politics. They dont know much about history actually. They just dislike the politics of PRC now. ",

Well, most of the Chinese people did not really read the history of China. If you ask me about their opinion especially those who are really interested in the History Of China, It would definitely or undoubtedly be the Overpowerful and Overglorious Tang Dynasty (618 to 907) especially Taizong of Tang who expanded the Tang Dynasty and made it the most powerful in the world at that time. And He also introduced Nestorian Christianity to the Tang Dynasty(even Manchu people would have to agree with what I say)(and till now, It is still the Golden Age of her). I am a Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity. I am a Malaysian Han Chinese who was born on 8th December 1997 in Brunei. And I am Teochew.
