            "answer_text": "Erdogan and his surroundings are itching for an armed showdown with Greece. His position in Turkey is shaking for nothing he had attempted turned out to his favor. He sees a conflict with Greece an opportunity to rally increased support to him by the majority of the Turks and for this end, he unleashed a campaign of demonizing everything Greek. I do hope and wish I am wrong and logical Turks will find enough strength to stop him before he opens the gates of Hell. ",
