            "answer_text": "In 1955, the UK made a claim on this rock in the ocean called Rockall. This was, in part, to help expand the UK\u2019s rights to resources in the economic zone surrounding the islet. The claims have been disputed by Ireland and other nations.  Now, a big rock islet hundreds of miles away from any continent might not seem that impressive. But just think of how many islets, atolls, or small islands lie in the world\u2019s oceans. These islands number into the tens or hundreds of thousands. Some of these little parcels of land are bound to be unclaimed or uninhabited, like the island Tom Hanks\u2019 character landed on in the 2000 film Cast Away. In real life, the island from the film is actually a natural reserve island called Monuriki, overseen by Fiji.  Many islands are unclaimed because they haven\u2019t formed just yet. Due to volcanic eruptions, moving glaciers, or other natural events, many new islands are being formed all the time. While there are countless islands in the ocean, don\u2019t set your ship sail just yet to go claim one. If you find an unclaimed island out there somewhere, you have a 50/50 chance it does lie in an existing state\u2019s exclusive economic zone. This zone is set aside for a nation to have exclusive rights to exploration, resources, and conservation. All the dark blue in the map below show the half of the world\u2019s oceans considered international waters. Most clearly these waters are farthest away from any continental land, so if you do find that unmarked islet you might just want to sit and gather your bearings before getting around to claiming the land.  You might be better buying an island for sale than going and trying to claim one. Gillis Island in Prince Edward Island, Canada is for sale only for a price of 80,000 (currency unknown and price subject to change).  ",

            "answer_text": "Behold Bir Tawil - Wikipedia!  It\u2019s the tiny little white bit between the orange (Egypt) and blue (Sudan). There is a long standing border dispute beween Egypt and Sudan about where the border runs. It started shorly after Egypt and Sudan became separate nations in 1956. Sudan believes the border runs around the white bit, then up to encompass the green bit. The Egyptians just claim the border runs straight on a line of latitude between the two countries. The problem is when the British were running both places, they drew the straight border (22 degrees north latitude) in 1899, then drew an administrative border to more closely follow which areas were administered from Cairo and which from Khartoum in 1902. Egypt insists the border is the 1899 line, and Sudan insists it\u2019s the 1902 line. So it\u2019s clear that both countries claim the green bit. The problem is that to have a legitimate claim on the green bit, neither country can claim the white bit. That would admit to the other that the border the other one wants is the correct one. At present, it appears to be the only habitable place on the planet not claimed by any government. It\u2019s not a big deal. Bir Tawil is only 800 square miles (about twice the size of the five boroughs of New York City) and has zero permanent residents. It\u2019s also a hellhole - daily highs range from 32 C in the cold months to 45 C in the hot months. At present, the green bit is de facto controlled by Egypt, which sent in troops when the possibility of oil was discovered. However, Sudan hasn\u2019t relinquished its claims. ",
