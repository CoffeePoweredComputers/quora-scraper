            "answer_text": "Certainly, the early Gnostic Christians did believe in at least two Gods, but this answer is limited to the orthodox branch of Christianity.  The first Christian writings that we know of are Paul\u2019s epistles (Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Philemon, Galatians, Philippians and 1 Thessalonians) and the Book of Hebrews. Paul referred to Jesus as the Son of God, but there is nothing to suggest that Paul saw Jesus as God. Hebrews also refers to Jesus as the Son of God, but also as the high priest in heaven, a term that seems inconsistent with any form of divinity. Mark\u2019s Gospel is regarded as portraying Jesus as a human who was adopted by God at the time of his baptism. In this, the first New Testament gospel to be written, Jesus even denies being divine: Mark 10:18: And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God. This takes us to around the end of the first century, when Matthew and then Luke began to appear. In these gospels, Jesus was the Son of God because he was divinely conceived, not because he was pre-existing or equal to God. Christians who followed the gospels had no reason to believe that Jesus was other than a human conceived and born from the intervention of God. By the second century, as we are moving away from the \u201cfirst Christians\u201d, John\u2019s Gospel appears. In this gospel, Jesus repeatedly refers to himself as divine, although not in terms that explain the Holy Trinity. Some of the Greek grammar used in this gospel is consistent with the author having believed that Jesus was a second God. By the late second century, Christian church leaders were experimenting with concepts that would lead, in the third century, to a developing belief in the Trinity and its adoptions as doctrine in the fourth-century Council of Nicaea. However, the issue continued to be debated until 381, when Emperor Theodosius made belief in the Trinity mandatory for all Christians. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. To make a VERY long story short, the church councils a few hundred years later decided on the concept of the \"trinity\" to explain what they seen in the Bible. It was a very tough debate, and some still do not believe that Athanasius, one of the bishops debating, should have won the debate. Arius, one of the others, had beliefs that were later held by groups such as the Jehovah's Witnesses. Anyway, the original church were mostly Jews, with extremely strong backgrounds in belief in only ONE God, Yahweh, and were still trying to deal with the new revelation of who and what God was, with the coming of the Messiah, Yahshua (Jesus) and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. The big question was over the concept of \"Persons\". Was God One \"Person\" or two \"Persons\" or three \"Persons\", and how exactly do you define \"Person\" when you are talking about God? We have clear Scriptures that say, over and over and over and over and over, God is ONE, God is ONE, you can't get away from that. But! You have manifestations of God that show that He relates to humans in these different ways. He is a Father to us. He is a Savior to us. He is a Spirit inside us. He is a Judge. He is a Redeemer. Is it fair to call these roles \"Persons\"? I'm not going to re-hash the same arguments that have been going on (and never, ever settled) for centuries, but I will say that there are very few books that shed light on the matter in any clear way. There was one years ago that, after spending $29.95 on it and reading +300 plus pages, tells you, we can't understand it, it's all a mystery. Really? I just spent 30 bucks so you can tell me that YOU don't understand it and I can't understand it, and NO ONE can understand it? So why argue ? The Bible tells us several times NOT TO ARGUE, and they're STILL stubbornly arguing over something they admit they can't understand!!So. What I will tell you is this. After many years of trying to figure it out, I read both sides of this argument and am trying to make peace with what I see as a ONE entity and him revealing Himself THREE WAYS. I read the book The Oneness of God by David Bernard, and seen one extreme view that ignored the \"threeness\" of God, and other books that emphasize the \"threeness\" and ignore His Biblical, Scriptural, ONENESS. The reason for that was not the Bible, the reason for that was church councils which ORDERED people to ignore any opposing point of view and NOT think for themselves, just agree with us or we'll call you a \"heretic\" and toss you out. So the bottom line TO ME is to read, meditate, think, and question. Use your brain. And, DEFINE YOUR TERMS. We humans are created in the image of God. Are we \"three separate persons\"? Think about that before just accepting a belief without thought. That is my main advice: THINK. ",

            "answer_text": "Important question. It is clear in the writings of the New Testament that God is one a united one (like the meaning of a bunch of grapes) as it is in the Old Testament of God is Elohim, or 'the Gods'. The Apostles of Jesus knew that God was Father, as revealed and taught by Jesus. They also knew and experienced the Holy Spirit, which was an entity in his own right. We see this in the Old Testament too. And finally, Jesus was a man but also was resurrected from death proving to the Apostles of Jesus was divine. They use the Greek word Kyrios or King for Jesus, similar to Caesar of the Roman Empire, but Jesus is King or Master of the Kingdom of God. Saint Paul declares Jesus was the same as God the Father and God the Holy Spirit. See For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form.\u201d Colossians 2:9 and Thomas answered and said to Him, \u201cMy Lord and my God!\u201d John 20:28 .Jesus himself stated Jesus said to them, \u2018Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am.'\u201d John 8:58. Jesus was saying he was Yahweh or God the one who has always existed. But look at this- 'I and the Father are one.\u201d 31 The Jews took up stones again to stone Him. 32 Jesus answered them, \u201cI showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?\u201d 33 The Jews answered Him, \u201cFor a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God.\u201d John 10:30-33. These people did not understand who the Messiah or the Anointed one of God was, but they understood Jesus was stating He was god and equal with the Father. The issue is, was Jesus a created being of God the Father and the Holy Spirit? This was a heresy in some groups in the past as well as today but the Bible is clear Jesus is not a created being at all but a part of the One or united God. Sadly Islam sees Jesus as a created being which takes away his divinity and distorts many Muslims understanding of the true God.

            "answer_text": "This is a controversal question. Athanasian Trinitarians have a different answer for this question. Unitarian Christians an other answer different from Athanasians. As for a neutral answer First Christians believed in Jewish Monotheism, the Monotheism which is conserved in Judaism from Moshe [Moses] to this date of writing. There are however some verses in NT which are used to prove Trinity like \u201cI and My Father are One\u201d, \u201cThe Word Was God\u201d, \u201cAll that Belong to Father is Mine\u201d , Four famous \u201cI Am\u201ds etc. But none of them proves Trinity. There is no explicit verse which can be used for Trinity. Ask any Trinitarian how do they prove Trinity and he is likely to answer with some arguments. There is a difference between between an Explicit Verse in favour of the Dogma of Trinity and an argument from a Verse in support of Trinity. So this difference is known to many Trinitarian Scholars yet many do confuse it deliberately. For example consider the sentence of the verse \u201cAll that Belong to Father is Mine\u201d Mathew 16:15. This sentence is silent on the issue whether Iesous is a Hypostasis in the Perse subsistent Godhead of God OR Not. But Trinitarians argue differently. Some say Only God can say all things are mine. Only one who is equal to Father can say All things are mine. These are only arguments. Are First and Second Hpostases equal. Certainly Not. The First Hypostasis is Unissued and the the Second Hypostasis is issued. An issued one and an unissued one can never be equal. So a Trinitarian is likely to argue \u201cNot equal in all regards but equal in Godhead of God. I.e an Approximate equality. This constitutes the proof that this is a argument , not an explicit sentence. Such arguments did not exist in the time of Iesous Himself, and if he said such sentences , they were either Parables or Metaphors . It took a period from the time of disciples to the time of Athanasius to take the meanings of Trinity from the verses which were some centuries old at the time of Athanasius. It is very difficult that the authors of books of NT take such sentences which they themselves authored , in the meanings which support the Dogma of Trinity. It does appear that the authors of NT themselves believed in Strict Jewish Monotheism. There does appear a tendency in second generation of Christians that Iesous was Neither Eternal Nor Made but Generated. Generation is an other act to bring a non existent into existence beside Making or Creation. How ever it is implicit not explicit. Some thing which came in existence in Godhead of God which did not exist before. This tendency is found in some of the sentences of some Pre- Athanasian Scholars. Often used by Trinitarians to prove Trinity. But it did took some time to opine that Generation is an Eternal Immanent act . So a transfer might occur from \u201cBegotten/Generated but neither Eternal Nor Made / Created\u201d to \u201cBegotten and Eternal and Not Made/Created\u201d. But there is no evidence that the first generation of Christians believed in Trinity. Even if Iesous is supposed to believe in Trinity , he did not said it inexplicit words and his first followers and disciples had no idea of Trinity and the Hypostases in the Triune God. If it is correct that these verses does prove trinity on some reasonings then it took centuries to know these reasonings. Meanwhile these authors did not know these reasonings and continued to believe in Jewish Monotheism instead of Athanasian Trinity. It must be noted that opinions may differ, and it is certain that Trinitarians must differ from this point of view. I personally do not want to annoy them it is their right to differ, so do I. I suggest that you think yourself instead of following me or else . If you do think my answer is incorrect then try to find an answer which you think is correct. I only shared my views. To those who disagree from me I say, yes you have the right , yet I most humbly request that I do not wish to hurt any one\u2019s feeling.Thanks for asking. ",

            "answer_text": "Application of Greek philosophical concepts was weak and inconsistent at first since the first Christians were Jews and also non-philosopher Greek-speakers. Paul\u2019s are the oldest Christian documents, and contain a few references to pre-Pauline belief in hymns and creed-like statements as when he mentions what he learned from Peter and James. Paul\u2019s letters contain what is sometimes called a \u201cproto-Trinitarianism\u201d showing the evolving concept as quite old but not the well-formed doctrine of later. E.g. Philippians 2:5-11, the so-called \u201cChrist hymn\u201d has Jesus, being in the form of God, divest himself of glory, humbling himself to the ignominy of death on a cross, only to be exalted (vv. 9-11). And using \u201cLord,\u201d kyrios \u201dthat in the Greek version of the Old Testament was reserved for God alone (the Greek kyrios substitutes for God\u2019s proper name in Hebrew, YHWH, the \u201cTetragrammaton\u201d). Also exactly when Jesus obtained divinity varies in different books of the New Testament. Sometimes it seems to be at his resurrection, or at his baptism, or when he goes public, or when he is born, or \u201cin the Beginning\u201d. So even if you accept the idea that some type of Trinitarianism existed, it varied in ideas about Jesus. ",

You can find all the objective information you need on the subject in many religious encyclopedias, but when it comes to church doctrine, they LOVE the Trinity. Don't know why. I literally have 100s of scriptural verses collected under the category of (rejection of the) Trinity. Look at Egyptian, Babylonian, Nordic gods, they all have triune gods. Christendom adopted its own. Why is it important? The Creator is set on the same level as its creation. Are you on the same level as your son? No, you are wiser, more experienced, possibly stronger, \u2026. There are too many reasons to list why this belief is false. Literally 100\u2019s ",
