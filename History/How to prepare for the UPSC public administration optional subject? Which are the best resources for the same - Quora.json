Books for Pub Ad Paper I Administrative Thinkers by Prasad and PrasadPublic Administration: Administrative Theories and Concepts by Fadia & FadiaPublic Administration and Public Affairs 12th Edition \u2013 Nicholas HenryMohit Bhattacharya- New horizons in Public administrationMohit Bhattacharya- Pub Ad A new lookPublic Administration: Concepts and Theories by Basu RumkiIGNOU BooksARC ReportsBooks for Pub Ad Paper II Indian Administration \u2013 Ramesh K. Arora & Rajni GoyalYojanaNewspaperARCs and committee reportsStrategy for answer writing Do not write here as you write in GS. They should be \u2018Pub Ad\u2019 answers. Use administrative terminology from the subject; quote thinkers and theories in your answer; and explore the issue on administrative lines. As for an example, if a question on reducing the size of Indian Cabinet comes, you should be able to write its positive and negative implications based on delegation and decentralization; efficiency; organizational behaviour; informal grouping angle etc.Try to relate your answer with the basic theories, contemporary and cross-cultural practices. For e.g. in comparing the strength of executive accountability to legislature, compare that of US and India. You can also quote that in 2013 US Congress stopped fund flow to the executive. Such financial control is difficult to achieve in India given the dominance of executive in the Indian Parliament.Also, try to cover almost any answer right from its basics. For e.g. if a question on comparison between Bernard and Simon comes, you should first clearly state what both thinkers claim, and then explore similarities or dissimilarities.Try to use the quotes, committees, reports in your answer.And most importantly, don\u2019t use the complicated language rather than use a simple language.You should state the concept clearly and take a fair stand on issues by giving appropriate logic and evidence from both sides.That\u2019s all, i can say.
