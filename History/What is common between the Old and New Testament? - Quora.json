            "answer_text": " In my mind, there are three things that are common in both the Old and New Covenant. although the Old Covenant Saints could not adequately fulfill these three objectives; nonetheless they always existed and remained so even in the New Covenant. Essentially they remain the common theme. They are: Love for GodLove for selfLove for people************************************************************************************** Scriptures: Deuteronomy 6:4 \u201cHear, O Israel: [a]The Lord our God, the Lord is one! 5 You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. Mark 12:30 And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.\u2019 [a]This is the first commandment. 31 And the second, like it, is this:\u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no other commandment greater than these.\u201d Romans 13v8 Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law. ************************************************************************************** Love God - To love God means to put him first in all things. This includes thinking about how every action you take will affect God. Asking whether your next actions will be pleasing to him. Considering whether you are giving your best. The children of Israel were instructed to sacrifice animals without blemish and in Romans chapter 12 we are to offer ourselves as that living sacrifices holy and pleasing to God which is a reasonable act of worship. We are told to love the Lord with all our heart, soul, strength, money, abilities, talents - everything! Love Yourself - When you love God it helps you realize how much God loves you, it then empowers you to start loving yourself. One of the challenges of poor self-esteem is when someone does not realize how much God loves and values them. If they do they will instinctively place the same value on themselves. When that happens the person has no time for poor self-esteem or depression. They want to get out of there and start pleasing God realizing what a blessing they are to all mankind; they start fulfilling God\u2019s purpose and living life. Besides the scripture says love your neighbor as you love yourself. It stands to reason that if you don't value yourself you're not going to value your neighbor. if you don't love yourself you're not going to love your neighbor!  Love Your Neighbour - Once you love God and you love yourself you want to treat your neighbor the way you expect your neighbor to treat you. I don't understand how people drive past their neighbors without offering a lift nor feel an ounce of guilt. How does that work? You're supposed to be helpful to your neighbor. If you see a neighbor's child doing something wrong and you say nothing to the child or the parent - what kind of neighbor are you? You might blurt out - \u201cthat's none of my business\u201d. Question is would you like your neighbor to help you? Then show yourself friendly first. I would surmise by saying that the principle of \u201cLove\u201d is the major similarity between the Old Covenant and the New Covenant I really hope it helps God bless you Boomy Tokan ",

            "answer_text": "There is nothing common between the old and new. Because there no such thing. Even now from the very beginning, all is just one continuous revelation Of His ForeKnowledge and Knowledge Of His Will, revealed By His Word, being unfolded. From the beginning when He did create, He since has used chosen men to reveal what He has done, what He Is doing and what He Will do. What He has accomplished is already done and finished. All according to His ForeKnowledge. And what did happen, and is now happening is the process of what He already knows. His Will, past, present and future, Will happen and come to pass, that of what He already knows. Nothing then, absolutely nothing!, can be stopped. of what He already knows. Ab??Even to the shifting of each one grain of sand on a thousand beaches, to the movement of the most minute particle. Therefore, there is no old or new testament. However, covenants He has made, are just coming to pass. Already revealed By His chosen nation. That what need to be made known. Yet it is all a continuous. From the beginning of the creation until now, and will be. What is to be known by man will be made known. And that which remains a mystery will remain a mystery. Just as He, Ha AHAYA, has purposed all things according to His ForeKnowledge. All what He knows and allows, will be. It is all one continuous. Even to the coming Of Ha Mashaiakh having creation, all, subject to Him, as planned Of His Ab. This Is The Will Of Him Who did create all things He created, for His purpose and His pleasure. This Will Of His cannot be stopped. For this Is known Of Ha AHAYA and will be. Therefore it is not an old or a new testament thing ever. But even many covenants spoken past, being unfolded and coming into being. Since the beginning He created until now. Just one continuing, from the beginning until He decides the beginning\u2019s end.
