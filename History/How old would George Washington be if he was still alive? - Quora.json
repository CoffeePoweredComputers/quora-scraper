            "answer_text": "He would be 287 years old. Considering that no human male has ever lived more than ca 116 years. Washington if he was alive, he would have now at this point in time lived 2 and 1/2 longer than Christian Mortensen the oldest ever American male. the oldest man is from japan Jiroemon Kimura. However consider what George Washington achieved during his life time we could argue he belongs to the ages\u2026and that he still lives on in our memory. Washington might have lot of memorials dedicated to him in US, but human history is tought around the globe and only fool would fail to regonize George Washington\u2019s greatest. He was offered the ultimate power of King only to turn it down\u2026not once but twice.  ",
