            "answer_text": "For aircraft such as the Chance-Vought Corsair F4U, and the Junkers Ju-87 Stuka, it was to accommodate the landing gear. Having the inverted gull wing arrangement (the letter \u201cW\u201d in your question), is a design element to address specific design problems for the aircraft, and it usually revolves around the need to have a much sturdier but shorter (hence lighter) landing gear. In the case of the Stuka, the landing gear is fixed (does not retract), but the aircraft was meant to operate from unprepared fields where the ground was unlikely to be level as the Stuka was intended to be airborne artillery for the German army. This meant that the landing gear had to be extra sturdy which added a lot of weight. By making the landing gear shorter, the extra weight of the sturdy landing gear could be offset. Additionally, having the inverted gull wings allowed more room for ordinance staff to mount the bomb to the belly of the aircraft. The Corsair didn\u2019t need lighter landing gear, but it had a number of unique challenges that using the inverted gull wing solved. The first was that it was the biggest engine ever used (up to that time) on a aircraft meant for carrier based service. It also had the biggest propeller\u2014the diameter of the turning propeller was 13 feet(!) which was huge for the day (1940). Like the situation for the Stuka, carrier landings are often very rough and landing gear needs to be very sturdy. Additionally, the landing gear on the Corsair cannot retract into the body of the airplane as there are oil coolers on the leading edge of the wing root, so it has to retract straight back to the rear of the wing which really limited its length. A longer landing gear for a straight wing, such as the gear on the TBF Avenger (which used the same engine and propeller as the early Corsairs) simply did not fit, so it was much easier to invert the wing and shorten the gear.

            "answer_text": "If u are referring to the 2 most prominent examples ill answer one at a time.1st we have the F4U Coursair  As u clearly see this warbird has a huge propeller. This was used to maximise the speed of this fighter. As such u needed to raise the nose so u wouldnt plow the ground everytime u started this engine. But that leads to a problem when elongating the strut of the landing gear. Longer struts are inherently weaker, and this plane was originally designed for Carrier use. Landing on a Carrier takes stronger than normal landing struts as the deck of the Carrier would often rise up to meet the landing airplane due to wave action. So to shorten the strut for the needed strength meant using the inverted gull shaped wing.  This allowed the upraised nose but shorter stronger landing gear strut needed for Carrier use. The next example is the JU 87 Stuka \u2026.  Now this aircraft had fixed landing gear, but needed ground clearance for its bombs or other ordinance it would carry..  This version had 2 40 mm cannons in pods under the wings for anti-tank use. Again strong landing gear struts vs ground clearance necessitated the inverted gull wing shape. Also remember this plane was used in forward air bases closer to the front for ground support and so often flew out of airfields that were nothing more than dirt and grass. So while one was an offshoot of the need for speed and the other due to its role as a dive bomber , both used the inverted gull wing to shorten the distance the landing gear struts needed to cover inorder for both planes to survive takeoff and landings.
