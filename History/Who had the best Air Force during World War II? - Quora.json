            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a tricky question as it changes almost year by year from the late 1930\u2019s to 1945. Not only in aircraft designs and what was put into production in sufficient numbers but having both the aviation gasoline to train pilots sufficiently before combat and the time (and manpower pools, particularly how many might have already been flying as civilian hobbyists, commercial pilots, cropdusters, World War I combat pilots (Germany and Britain\u2019s talent pool particularly), or paramilitary youth training programs like the Civil Air Patrol in the U.S.). Aviation fuel availability for training may well have been the essential constraint that kept the Axis powers from replacing their pilot losses with the same quality.So in the 1930\u2019s-1941 it\u2019s probably Germany and Japan on all metrics from advanced planes (actually everybody was designing advanced aircraft then, but the Germans and Japanese governments prioritized building lots of them rather than leaving them at the prototype or very small quantities production levels. It took several years to fully set up for production of anything new, let alone the complexity of that era\u2019s aircraft with several hundred thousand unique parts on a bomber alone. So starting on that years before war with another air force was a huge advantage that lasted for years (but the cost of retooling by 1943\u20134 meant only the U.S., Russia, and UK were fielding newer designs with better engines, more armor, 20mm explosive ammunition instead of tracer and solid .50 cal/12.7mm or .303/7.92/.30\u201306 rifle cartridges, radar, much better radios, plexiglass, better propeller and wing designs, extended range and self-sealing fuel tanks, etc.But the loss of access to American aviation fuels and at that time comparatively rare aluminum for aircraft bodies (a country had to have a lot of new, large-scale hydroelectric dams built before the war to produce the prodigious electricity needed for aluminum smelting and refining, one I know from that era consumed over 300 Megawatts alone or enough power for 600,000+ 1930\u2019s homes. Coal-fired electricity was too costly back then and every country but the U.S. was still trying to meet existing consumer and commercial electricity needs while the U.S. had built a great deal of surplus power (no customers at the time) as make-work projects during the Great Depression such as Hoover Dam, Grand Coulee Dam, Fort Peck Dam, the Tennessee Valley Authority, etc.). So even tooled up for new designs at Axis factories meant the essential aluminum or magnesium (another light aircraft body material only the U.S. had the capacity to make by 1942\u20133 with completely new facilities just like it\u2019s amazing construction of new aluminum smelters during the war to increase production over 500% over 1941 levels.)By 1941 Great Britain probably had the best air force after adapting to the great pressures of the endless German attacks with the Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane (the Hawker actually shot down more German aircraft), the development of the precision low level bomber the de Havilland Mosquito that no one else matched and proved far more decisive than the medium and heavy bombers everyone tried to build, integration of radar and ground control, camouflaged and underground aircraft hangars, a worldwide pilot training program so pilots could learn in the safety of India, Australia and Canada, Frank Whittle\u2019s work on jet turbine engines that produced British jet fighters nearly as soon as the Messerschmidt and Focke Wulf jet fighter projects, and senior officers with direct combat experience from WWI. Being drawn into the Douhet fantasies of winning wars with endless strategic bombing and Churchill\u2019s desire to strike back at German civilian populations after the Germans\u2019 devastation of Coventry, England gradually took the British air force into the path of irrelevance with vast fleets of bombers that mostly missed high value targets and suffered high casualty rates while losing most of it\u2019s capacity to support infantry and armored advances directly (what actually worked very well.)By 1943\u20134 it\u2019s the American air forces (Army and Navy being quite separate in their actual aircraft, missions, training, theaters of operation, scale of airbases, and foes.)The great designs of the American planes were often from the late 1930\u2019s-1941 (North American P-51 Mustang, Grumman F4F and F6F, Boeing B-17, Consolidated PBY Catalina, etc.) with innovations in tooling and production processes that allowed continual improvement of old designs while they were being built (thousands of changes per model) and the most rapid production of new designs. America\u2019s highly competitive aircraft industry meant there were many solutions, models, and facilities available and scalable unlike countries with much smaller industries (to a lesser extent that same competing factories greatly helped German and Japanese air forces develop, particularly the Messerschmidt and Focke Wulfe rivalries.) The U.S. had Douglas, Curtiss-Wright, Boeing, General Motors\u2019 North American, Consolidated, Ford Motor Company\u2019s Aviation, Brewster, Lockheed, McDonnell, Glenn L. Martin, Cessna, Piper, and more (over a thousand aircraft builders in the 1920\u2019s boom along with the most automakers who quickly became the engine-builders for the aircraft along with General Electric\u2019s turbine-mfg. expertise from power generation demands.While the U.S. also went to strategic bombing thanks to the naive fantasies of President Roosevelt who thought that would win the wars from afar with minimal casualties, calling for 50,000 combat aircraft by 1942 when U.S. production of mostly obsolete models like the Brewster Buffalo would max out at a few thousand at most.The steady upgrading of it\u2019s fighter aircraft in armor, firepower, and durability under fire allowed it\u2019s North American P-51 Mustangs and Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighters to do very effective ground troops support and supplies interdiction (shooting up trains, bridges, and truck convoys) in Europe.The sheer number of planes with plenty of fuel to train at peaceful airfields back in the United States, as well as the first flight simulators for on the ground pilot training safely and specially-built trainer aircraft of greater simplicity meant they were the best prepared pilots in the world by late in the war.The U.S.\u2019s advances in electronics, well beyond the Germans and British thanks to AT&T\u2019s Bell Labs particularly (a unique R&D center in the world) made both the aircraft and ground control rapidly more sophisticated than anywhere in the world and loading aircraft with advanced electronics became an enduring hallmark of U.S. air forces strategy.Much better long range detection, instruments-only navigation capacity, aircraft condition monitoring in real time, more reliable and longer range radios, frequency skipping radios to allow secure communication instead of \u201cradio silence\u201d in coordinating attacks and getting back home, better real-time targeting of bombs, rockets, and cannons/machine guns, pilot comforts like pressurization, etc. add up to making anyone a much better pilot and much more likely to live long enough to accumulate valuable experience.

            "answer_text": "I think you would have to break down the mission of Air Forces in World War II and evaluate the various forces at each task and timeframe. Over time, the best Air Force changed as the war progressed, defeat and victories achieved, losses incurred, etc. For the purpose of this answer, I will use modern terminology. Air Superiority/ Supremacy - This control of the air. The difference between superiority and supremacy is enemy interference. Superiority means there is no enemy air interference in your operations and supremacy mean no effective enemy interference at all. The former means little to no enemy air craft and the later means their air defenses are ineffective as well. At the start of the war, the Luftwaffe achieved air superiority over the Western Front until confronted by the RAF during the Battle of Britain. It tried to achieve air superiority over southern England and failed. After this, there was air parity over the English Channel. As the war dragged on, the Western Allies (RAF, USAAF, RCAF, Allied air forces) achieved air superiority over all of Western Europe by 1944. On the Eastern Front, the Luftwaffe achieved a high level of air superiority over the Red Air Force, destroying over 21 000 aircraft in six months versus a loss of less than 400 of their own. Like the Western Front, this was lost over the course of the war as the Red Air Force rebuilt itself from the ground up and achieved air parity operationally and superiority tactically. In the Pacific, a similar series of events followed. The Japanese quickly achieved air superiority in its areas of operations until mid-1942 and the Battle of Midway. After this, the US (USAAF, USN, and USMC) air units achieved air superiority where their operations were being conducted up to an including over Japan itself by 1945. This was achieved through pilot training, more advanced aircraft both in quality and quantity and new tactics. Strategic Bombing \u2013 sustained air attack on industrial, transportation and communications targets. Prior to the war, it was believed that victory through strategic bombing alone could achieve victory and that ground forces would only be needed to \u201cmop up\u201d afterwards. This didn\u2019t work out but the achievements of the bombing campaigns cannot be ignored or dismissed. An example can be found here: Why-didnt-the-Allies-focus-on-strategically-bombing-the-Nazi-petrochemical-and-fuel-industries-earlier-in-the-war-They-are-both-critical-and-flammable-Wouldnt-that-have-crippled-the-Axis-sooner/1 In this mission, the hand down \u201cbest\u201d was the strategic bombing forces of the RAF, USAAF and RCAF. The only three air forces to field large numbers of heavy strategic bombers. The largest being the B-29 bombers used over Japan in 1944/45. The use of the atomic bombs followed this doctrine. The Luftwaffe, Imperial Japanese AAF and Red Air Forces all conducted bombing missions but these air forces were focused more on the tactical missions as opposed to strategic missions and didn\u2019t develop heavy bombers, deploy them in large numbers or use them in large numbers like the three I mentioned in the previous paragraph. Interdiction / Strike \u2013 air attack against enemy forces not an immediate threat to delay, disrupt or hinder their freedom of movement. All of the Air Forces conducted this mission during the war and was recognized as a force multiplier early on. The biggest air campaigns were conducted in North Africa and Western Europe before and after D-day. A key prerequisite for this is air superiority in the area in question. This allows attacking aircraft more time over the target, allowing them to focus on the target itself and not self-defense first, etc. Again, the western allies (RAF and USAAF) were the best at this. In six weeks, they smashed the French rail network, hindering German movement before, during and after D-day. Even German units moving to attack the allies in Normandy had to take enemy air attack into account just to move to the area. Close Air Support \u2013 air attack on enemy forces in close contact or proximity to friendly forces. It was widely accepted as an important element in operations by all of the major Air Forces. Like air superiority, the Luftwaffe developed and employed a high level close air support in the beginning of the war. This continued until 1943 when air superiority started to be contested or lost. The infamous Ju-87 Stuka has come to represent close air support of the Blitzkrieg campaigns of the early war period. The Red Air Force developed the Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik which was a highly effective close air support aircraft. The Western Allies, were late to develop close air support aircraft and tactics but both were in place by 1944 and used to the end of the war in Europe. In the Pacific, the USN and USMC used close air support in conjunction with or as a replacement for indirect fire support in the island hopping campaign. The USMC first looked at the use of aircraft for this mission in 1917 and entered the war with a doctrine developed in the inter-war period. The best would have to be the IX Tactical Air Command (USAAF) supporting the US 1st Army advance across France and into Germany. General Quesada (Commander IX TAC), deployed aircraft in formations over advancing units to provide close air support as required and on demand. Transportation \u2013 organized delivery of men and material via military airlift. All Air Forces in the war employed transport aircraft but one stands head and shoulders over the rest, the USAAF. The sheer number of aircraft and size of aircraft deployed made them the largest. Over Western Europe, there were enough transports to aerial re-supply at least divisions alone. In the China-Burma-India theatre (CBI), the USAAF delivered over 650 000 tons on material to China in 42 months between May 1942 to July 1945. Training \u2013 the development of the required pilots, aircrew and ground personnel to operate and maintain the aircraft. The British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (aka \u201cThe Plan) remains the largest training program in aviation history. This Plan produced half of the required pilots and crew for the RAF, RCAF, FAA, RAAF, RNZAF and other Air Forces for the war. Canada alone trained over 167 000 aircrew including 50 000 pilots. Part of the reason for the downfall of the Luftwaffe and Japanese Air Forces (army and Navy) was the downward spiral of their training programs as the war progressed. At the start, the Japanese and Germans had some of the best trained and experienced aircrews but loses and lack of sufficient and sufficiently trained replacements eroded this edge. ",
