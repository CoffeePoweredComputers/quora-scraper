            "answer_text": "Erm, right. my specialty, how to condense three years at uni , three decades of practice into three paragraphs ? So pottery and stone: stick pieces together , so you do not loose bits . We use adhesives that do not age , we have a variety of fillers with pros and cons. pots can come in with insoluble salts of the surface , includes sea shells and corals we remove this with acid and with soluble salts we soak the pots in water to remove salts the surface may be friable , consolidate with a long lasting polymer glass: ancient glass have an unstable chemistry , give them an environment they do not react to , might include pollution reduction, possible consolidation mend as above metals: might continue to rust so give a condition they won\u2019t react with iron hates chloride , there are several methods to remove chorine, x ray it as the rust is usually so bulky as you cannot tell what it is clean with a mini sand actually Al2O3 blaster or engraving tool copper and silver both hate sulphur remove it from the pollution, clean with scalpel and or chemicals, use of corrosion inhibitors like BTA caution your kidneys probable carcinogen, use of Incralac a surface coating lacquer lead hates organic acids , is emitted from wood paint etc use pollution scavengers , conduct \u201cOddy tests\u201d to find low emitters or check the British museum list to see if they approve of it (to see it I google British Museum Selabond a googlewack) metals mend as before waterlogged organic materials: remove water without the artefact becoming gross and collapsing , my fave method uses a freeze dryer , needs to be small to fit in the machine , freeze dried stuff feels strange so light , other methods exist including bulking with sugar or wax , clean with water and detergent organic materials , conduct an ipm integrated pest management multi front war on insects to make the museum sterile, traps including use the of pheromones , doors seals , pesticides ,quarantine etc mend as before , and extra things such as I reshaped an Egyptian basket that was squashed by humidifying it and tying loose bundles with fishing wire Regulate light to stop things fading zero or as good as UV , Thomson set lux levels for materials , this is being modified now to lux hours budgets disaster plan to stop incidents from earthquake, fire ,flood ,bad handling etc and reduce damage should it happen any queries let me know below I will have missed several things, I\u2019m sure please do not try at home much of what we do is covering up after \u2018civilians\u2019 had a go ",

            "answer_text": "Museums have large staffs of people trained in restoration and preservation (like Paul Harrison, who already responded to this question) of all the types of art, antiquities other objects in there collections. I assume there are also companies and individual that museums call in for specific projects they don\u2019t have enough expertise or staff to cover. These people are always working on something. Not long ago the Smithsonian took the Star Spangled Banner off display and did a lengthy examination to restore and better preserve it. ",
