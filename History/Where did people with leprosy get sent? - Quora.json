            "answer_text": "Historically, people with leprosy were sent to isolated colonies, banished to the wilderness, or sent to charitable leprosaria. It is worth noting that the biblical term tsa\u2019arath could refer to any number of skin diseases, not just Hansen\u2019s Disease with visible lesions. In the last century or so, the notable leprosy colonies/hospitals in the US were Molokai, in the Hawaiian Islands, and Carville, Louisiana. After viable cures were discovered for Hansen\u2019s Disease after WW II - first certain sulfone drugs, and then antibiotics - the US Public Health Service maintained the hospitals at both sites to provide residences and care for patients who had lived there all their lives, who had no family or profession to return to, and many of whom had suffered debilitating effects from the disease. I believe the last of these long-term residents have since passed on. I believe the USPHS maintains a research facility at Carville for further studies of the disease and to provide treatment advice for the cases of Hansen\u2019s Disease that still crop up in the US (don\u2019t pet the armadilloes!). I don\u2019t know the situation in other countries, especially those where leprosy is more common. The severe and legally enforced isolation of earlier times is not really necessary, since about 90% of adults are naturally immune to Hansen\u2019s bacillus (mycobacterium leprae) and transmission requires prolonged and close-quarters contact over time in any case.
