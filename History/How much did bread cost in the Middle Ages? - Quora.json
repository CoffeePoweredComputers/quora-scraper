            "answer_text": "The medieval era lasted for almost 500 years and spanned across Europe and the Middle East. The prices of many different goods changed drastically as the supply and demand soared or fell. Firstly, bread was the staple in Medieval Europe (as it is now as well) and thus could be found anywhere and everywhere across Europe. Many farmers grew grain and thus the supply was relatively high. However, during periods of famine, disease or war the prices of even the simplest goods may soar or drop really low. Foods for example, had a super high price during famines but a relatively lower price during disease as there were less demand for them (a lot of dead people). Many people used barter instead of money because it was more efficient and easier to trade goods. The average worker during the medieval time period earned around a penny a day and around 2 pounds per annum ( I have the currency explanation below). These wages would change dramatically according to the year however. During wars and famine, they would earn less and need to pay more but during large diseases they could expect to earn more and spend less for goods ( this was because of less demand and more supply). Some peasants, however, did not earn money, they would work for their land lord in return for food and housing, but most did earn some form of money. What I am trying to say is that the prices of anything are hard to calculate so far back in time. This has, however, not stopped people from trying to find out. Even the currency was complicated back then, to explain how much anything is worth you need to understand the money.  1 pound (L) = 20 shillings (s)  1 crown = 5 shillings  1 shilling = 12 pence (d)  1 penny = 4 farthings  1 mark = 13s 4d. I know this is a lot to take in, but it is fascinating how complicated and advanced their currency was when you understand it, just understand that the penny was the basic unit of currency. I will show you guys the prices of some basic goods. Wines could cost anywhere from between 4 pence and 8 pence per galon depending on the quality and availability. Ale could range from 0.75 to around 1.5 per gallon. Dried fruits could go for around 1-4 pence per pound. 80 pounds of cheese could go for 3 shillings and 4 pence. These are some examples, and I'm sorry I did not list bread because I couldn't find the exact pricing anywhere. However it would most likely cost around 2-3 pence per loaf.  This is a complicated question and thus this  answer may also be complicated,  and I may have made some mistakes (Many I think;)) so feel free to correct me!  These are some awesome website and PDFs which you could visit if you want to know more about the subject and the pricing of other items.

            "answer_text": "That of course varies over the millennium which makes up the period. Plus, some people were paid bread as part of their wages, so you can only guess the equivalent financial cost. The first actual statement of bread prices we have from France is in Charlemagne\u2019s statutes of 794: \u201cIf one wants to sell [grain] as bread, twelve loaves of wheat, each of two pounds, must be given for one denier... fifteen of rye, of two pounds each, twenty of barley, of two pounds each, twenty five of oats, of two pounds each.\u201d FRENCH BREAD HISTORY: Early medieval bread But of course then you have to look at the relative value of a denier (a silver coin). In 1268, Parisian statutes defined bread as being worth a denier, two deniers (a doubleau) and a half (demie). But since the statute says nothing about the weight (it was undoubtedly a white wheat bread), we can only guess (from later information) that it was probably under a pound. Statutes from 1350 maintain the price, but vary the weight, depending on the price of wheat:Ordonnances des roys de France de la troisi\ufffdme race, recueillies par ordre chronologique Many cities continued to do this even after Paris began to vary the price for a set weight. During the Hundred Years war, bread could get very expensive, even as it declined in quality, so that at one point one paid 24 deniers for a \u201cpiece\u201d (probably just under a pound) of very bran-heavy bread.Choix de chroniques et m\ufffdmoires sur l'histoire de France In more normal times, it was to cost 20 deniers:Ordonnances des roys de France de la troisi\ufffdme race, recueillies par ordre chronologique In 1898, the marquis d\u2019Avenel did a massive survey of French prices across time; a little too helpfully, he tends to translate these into the francs and centimes of his period, but this at least gives a comparative idea of prices, if you read enough French to make it out:Histoire \ufffdconomique de la propri\ufffdt\ufffd, des salaires, des denr\ufffdes et de tous les prix en g\ufffdn\ufffdral depuis l'an 1200 jusqu'en l'an 1800 In England all this was set in the Assizes, which to complicate matters sometimes use the coinage also as the weight. So you\u2019re on your own in trying to make that out, as in this later look:The Assize of Bread, Etc. [Revised by John Powell.] B.L. \u201cAbout the same time the king caused a proclamation to be published for the lawfull sat. Paris. assise of bread to be made by the bakers, vpon paine to be punished by the pillorie: ...\". which assise was approved and assessed by the baker of Geffrey Fitz Peter, lord ch\u00e9ese of breed. Junstice of England, and by the baker of Robert de Tuinham. So that the baker might sell and gaine in everie quarter three pence, besides the bran, and two loaues for the heater of the oven, and for foure seruants foure halfepence, for two boies a farthing, for allowance in salt an halfepenie, yest an halfepenie, for candell a farthing, for fewell thr\u00e9e pence, and for a bulter an halfepenie. And this was the rate. When wheat was sold for six shillings the quarter, then shall euerie loafe of fine man chet wey 41 shillings, and euerie loafe of cheat shall wey 24 shillings. When wheat is sold for fiue shillings and six pence, then manchet shall wey 20 shillings, and cheat 28 shillings. When wheat is sold for fiue shillings, then manchet shall wey 24 shillings, and the cheat bread 32 shillings. When wheat is sold for foure shillings six pence, manchet shall wey 32 shillings, and cheat 42 shillings. When wheat is sold for foure shillings, manchet shall wey 36 shillings, and cheat 46 shillings. When wheat is sold for thr\u00e9e shillings six pence, then shall manchet wey 42 shillings, and cheat 54 shillings. . When wheat is sold for thr\u00e9e shillings, manchet shall wey 48 shillings, and cheat 44 shillings. When wheat is sold for two shillings and six pence, manchet shall wey 54 shillings, and cheat 72 shillings. When wheat is sold for two shillings, manchet shall wey sixtie shillings, and cheat foure pound. When wheat is sold for 18 pence the quarter, manchet shall wey 77 shillings, & cheat foure pound and eight shillings. \u201c Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland Note that \u201ccorn\u201d in old English usage meant grain, not maize.The Growth of English Industry and Commerce ...: Early and middle ages Prices of Corn in Oxford in the Beginning of the Fourtheenth Century: Also from the Year 1583 to the Present Time.

The Scots too used a system of Assizes which is somewhat more clearly explained here:Prices, Food and Wages in Scotland, 1550-1780 Similar records exist for Dublin, as well. The basic answer to your question is, \u201cit depended\u201d. Largely on the price of grain at a given moment, which in turn depended on abundance or famine, but also the degree of profit local authorities allowed. ",
