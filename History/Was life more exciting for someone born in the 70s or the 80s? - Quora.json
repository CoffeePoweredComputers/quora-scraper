            "answer_text": "DISCLAIMER: My answer is based only on my personal experiences and by no means do I refer to everyone born in that decade as like that. I was born in early 1980 which is neither 70s nor 80s though the year generally leaned more on the 70s. In ordinal system its considered the last year of 198th decade (ordinal version of the 70s) whereas in the cardinal system of counting decades its the first year of the 80s. Personally being born just 3 months away from the 70s, I consider myself more of a 70s baby. In my experience, I can say my life is more exciting compared to those born in the 80s and after because we experienced having lots of freedom as kids, we played outside until dark, remember life without internet, no hovering parents around to micromanage me so I did everything on my own, no cellphones, no pagers and even without video game consoles (we didn\u2019t have Atari and I was 9 when we had the NES). I remember the days when we had to go to the arcades and wait patiently for our turn to play Pacman, Galaga. Then I quit kid culture in 1989 when I hit my puberty and began doing adolescent stuff like having pen pals that included my then celebrity crush (local 80s teen hearthrob of my country), playing with FLAMES & MASH with my friends, the pass notes in class and autographing my friends. Also experienced cheating in class, used catalogues in library, drinking and my first experience with cigarette was when I was 8. I was very rebellious as a kid. I observe those even just less than 5 years younger than me to be very different. Although there are exceptions but most 80s babies that I met are too tame, soft, childlike, non-rebellious and to be frank, they\u2019re boring. They were the products of societal shift in parenting and so they\u2018re so used to be very close with their parents even to the point of choosing to obey them rather than following their own heart. Moreover they\u2019re more sedentary, chose to play video games than to go outside. No wonder why some 20s and 30 somethings already have diseases that are traditionally associated with middle and old ages such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke. ",

All the previous decades I have been working so many jobs and positions just trying to keep my head above water due to my parents seeking so many favors from me. This time I couldn\u2019t help anyone since I was not employed but taking care of my home and children which was important to us and so much happier after all everyone deserves some happiness in their life.
