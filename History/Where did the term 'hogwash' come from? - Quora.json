            "answer_text": "According to the Word Detective: \u201cHogwash\u201d in the farming sense is garbage, kitchen waste, or sometimes the leftover refuse of a brewery, used as slop or swill for the feeding of swine. The \u201cwash\u201d in \u201chogwash\u201d is derived from the noun \u201cwash,\u201d which has many senses, including \u201cwaste water, discharged after use in washing\u201d (as in rinsing out a pot, for instance), and \u201chogwash\u201d in the literal feed-the-piggies sense is indeed often largely liquid. \u201cHogwash\u201d first appeared in English in the barnyard sense around 1440, and by 1712 was being used as a synonym for cheap liquor or any other worthless thing, including bad writing. By the late 1800s, \u201chogwash\u201d was being used among journalists themselves to describe worthless writing in newspapers, and ever since \"hogwash\" has been used to mean any sort of intellectually fraudulent argument or specious proclamation.

            "answer_text": "-Hogwash is a simple compound noun formed around the mid-15th century from the two English nouns hog 'a type of swine, a pig' and wash 'waste liquid or food refuse from a kitchen.' The wash was often put to use as food for domesticated animals, particularly as swill for pigs. By 1712, hogwash could also be used to describe cheap, poorly made liquor; by 1773, poorly written manuscripts fell under the label of hogwash. In modern English, almost anything that is badly done or ridiculous can be equated with this term for barnyard slop. In current times it is is normally used to mean nonsense, rubbish or stupidity eg 90% of reality tv or 99.9% of trump\u2019s tweets. ",

Plates and trenchers were scraped and washed into a bucket and then mixed in with all the above to make \u201cmash\u201d or \u201cswill\u201d\u2014hence the word \u201cpigswill.\u201d \u2018Hogwash\u201d is a synonym for this mash. So \u201chogwash\u201d is food that you would never want to eat. So undesirable that only a hog would eat it. To say that your argument is \u201chogwash\u201d is to say that no one will swallow it.

In the United States 1800\u2019s steamboats carried passengers along the inland waterways of the United States. The wealty travelers stayed in thier state rooms and ate in the upper deck dinning room. Since they did not have refrigeration they kept live animals in pens on the lower deck. One of these animals were hogs. The aroma of the hogs was offensive to the boarding passengers so the deckhands would wash the hogs. And that is where the term began. Also when a passenger ate the hog in the upper deck dinning room it was called - eating high on the hog. The source for this definition is from The Mississippi Queen Steamboat. ",
