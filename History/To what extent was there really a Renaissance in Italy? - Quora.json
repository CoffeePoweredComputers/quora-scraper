            "answer_text": "Where are you writing from? What kind of books have you read? Do you know anything about Christian countries? Do you have any access to Wikipedia? Why ask such questions? The word Renaissance was coined in Germany in the 19th century. It means Rebirth. The so-called Renaissance took place in the republic of Florence, after the aristocracy and their militia had been expelled in 1250 and the town managed to achieve a rebirth of love for the all aspects of creation, especially for the pursuit of knowledge, which had been prevented by the Church, whose maxim was\u201d Ignorantia Beata\u201d. The Church\u2019s ferocious instrument of the Inquisition had been very successful in preventing any pursuit of knowledge except by the clergy, thanks to the protection of monarchs and nobility and their soldiery, who arrested anyone who went against their dictates , tortured and burnt at the stake any person condemned by the Inquisition. For almost a 1000 years, the Church had forbidden the study of Greek and Latin philosophers, mathematicians, geographers, astronomers, etc., as they were not Christian. They forbade the naturalistic representation in painting and sculpture of the natural world, as it was dubbed \u201cdiabolical\u201d The backgrounds in paintings of holy subjects ( who had to be represented in a very spiritual fashion) had to be golden symbolising the incorruptible essence of heaven - no landscapes, interiors, animals or plants, as all was judged to be a representation of the earthly diabolical world. When the Florentine people had got rid of the aristocracy and their soldiers and the Inquisition and the Church were no longer protected by the nobility, who depended on the Church for their investiture, they began to pursue knowledge, educating both their boys and their girls. Thanks to the enlightenment gained by reading the Greek and Latin writers, they started to realise the wonder of the natural world surrounding them and gave thanks to the Creator for such great gifts. They dug up the wonderful sculpture and discovered the paintings of the Greeks and Romans, which were full of naturalism and realism. They concluded that if, as the Church said, God was good and was the creator of everything, then everything had to be good- every race, religion, plant, animal. They started to study mathematics, geography, the natural world, medicine, and came to the conclusion that every plant and living thing was holy, as God had made everything. This realisation was not shared by other places in Italy and Europe, where the populations were governed by monarchies and nobles. The painters and sculptors also embraced the new way of thinking that was possible in Florence, because the Inquisition was no longer supported by any ruler. Giotto, Arnolfo di Cambio, Donatello, Filippo Lippi, Ghirlandaio, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael (who came to Florence from Umbria) were just some of the great artists who showed their love of creation in their realistic and prospect revealing paintings and sculpture. Literature and philosophy flourished once again (as they had in Greece and ancient Rome), as did all intellectual pursuits. All these people created a new fashion, that the rich and powerful all over Europe began to be eager to purchase or cultivate. This fashion was called the \u201cModern Way\u201d. In Rome, Milan, France, England, Germany, Spain, this new way of painting, sculpting, building, studying, translating, started to be cultivated, but in none of these places was the essential factor of freedom of thought advertised or supported, as in all these places there were rulers, prelates and aristocracy who did not want to criticise the Church and the Inquisition, which still continued to be powerful everywhere except in Florence. This Rebirth of Love, was later - in the 19th century, called the Renaissance, by a German philosopher. It was born and flourished in Florence. It was uncomprehendingly admired by many in other places, but it was brought to an end by a Florentine merchant family, called the Medici, who purchased a cardinalship for one of their sons, who was elected pope (Clement VII), thanks to heavy bribery and with his son, and with the help of Charles V of Spain\u2019s army, besieged Florence , bombarding the city with cannon for 11 months and in August 1530 defeated the republic and brought freedom of thought to an end. The pope\u2019s son, Alessandro de\u2019 Medici, became the first duke of Florence and re-instated the Inquisition. End of the Renaissance. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, there was a Renaissance in Italy. Book production went up a lot, and many new artworks were created. Trade also increased. Rosalynd Pio has some correct ideas, but she\u2019s wrong about the Catholic church: If anything, they were in favor of what we would call \u201cthe Italian Renaissance\u201d. They sponsored a lot of the art that was created during that time, they started the first universities, and they were the main people in Western Europe who preserved Greek and Roman texts until the Renaissance. Others, such as the Caliphate of Cordoba, deserve some credit, but the Caliphate of Cordoba disintegrated hundreds of years before the Renaissance. The capture of Florence by the Medici also was not the end of the Italian Renaissance. The Italian wars between 1500 and 1559 hurt Italy a lot. They were probably overall a much bigger factor in the end of the Renaissance. ",
