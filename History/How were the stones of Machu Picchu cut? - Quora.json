            "answer_text": "There are seven types of stone walls in Machu Picchu. Some are very rough and were meant to be covered in mud and painted in ochre colors. The most famous are the megalithic intrincately polished ones in the ritual places and the rooms of the lord of Macchu Picchu. Over and out of the building site, a few yards away, you can find a quarry of bedrock in the process of being cut. This is very common, the best buildings are near and over the quarrys, fused with the mountain. You should see the \u201cTemple of the moon\u201d in the other side of the mountain. By the look of it, the inca masons must have used bronce tools, wooden wedges and stone hammers, just as any other bronze age civilization. We have no extant bronze chisels (those tend to become blunted and recycled a lot). We do have lots of kitchen tools, knives and hand axes made of bronze found (lost) in less fancy places. We have water leveling trays made of stone. We have a room with a flat ceiling excavated (sculpted) in solid stone. They had a way with stone. It is very easy to translate the shape of a stone to another with sticks and yarn strings, but very labour intensive to cut the stone flat across the patterns. With the spaniard invasion came the iron tools and the bronze went out to make bells and gun cannons. The very stones of the inca\u2019s buildings were recut to make bricks for churches and houses for the invaders, by the very same inca masons. And thus the old technics and ways were lost to the times. ",

            "answer_text": "The stone work at Machu Picchu is not all the same, so I am assuming that you are referring to the close fitting, irregular shaped blocks, sometimes referred to as \u201cpolygonal\u201d masonry. This style is found quite extensively in Peru and also in many other parts of the world, such as Italy, Egypt, Greece and Japan. What I find very interesting, is that this style is used in areas clearly meant to be utilitarian, and not for show. This indicates to me that the method used was simply the most convenient. Archaeologists would have us believe, that each block was painstakingly carved until it was a perfect fit to its neighbors, I doubt very much, if that is the case. Having only seen videos and pictures of this stone work, I have concluded that this type of stone work, was not cut or carved, but cast, much as we use concrete today to cast shapes in a mould. The technology involved in building with this method has been lost, but was obviously widely used all over the world in ancient times. I have a sneaking suspicion that the outer casing stones of the pyramids were also cast, 1 layer at a time, and then filled in with the sandstone, which constitutes the bulk of the pyramids, but that is another matter.
