            "answer_text": "Tamils belong to Kumari Kandam a Sunken Continent that extends from connecting today\u2019s Tamil nadu with Madagascar in South west and connects Australia in the South East , See Pic :  Kumari Kandam (Sunken Continent) also known as Naavalan Theevu was the ancient and first place where human race had dwelled , Pandya Dynasty was formed in sunken land where 1st and 2nd Tamil Sangams presided by Lord Siva and Murugan were found in Then Madurai (South Madurai) and in Kapadapuram (near south of today\u2019s Sri lanka) , Sri Lanka is very much a part of Kumari Kandam where Tamils lived from ancient times. Tamils are very much Native peoples of Sri lanka from the ancient times. Sinhalese are descendants of King Vijaya who was expelled along with his hundreds of followers from indian kingdom (from vanga and Kalinga areas) , He ruled Lanka from 543 - 505 BCE displacing the original inhabitants known as Yakhas (Tamil: \u0baf\u0b95\u0ba9\u0bcd yakan, \u0b87\u0baf\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0ba9\u0bcd iyakan) , (a group of ancient tamil tribes) , and established a kingdom and became ancestors of the modern Sinhalese People. Many modern indians were under impression that Sinhalese are the native inhabitants of Lanka and Tamils are the ones who got migrated to Lanka , which is totally absurd argument as reverse is true , that Tamils were the ancient inhabitants of Lanka and Sinhalese are the descendants of Vijaya King and his followers who later came after being expelled from indian kindom from areas of Vanga and Kalinga during 543 BCE. (today\u2019s Bangladesh , West Bengal and Odisha ) Sri Lankan govts often gets continuous support of India against tamils by identifying themselves to be descendants of North Indians as against the Eelam Tamils. Sinhala language have large impact of Sanskrit in it , unlike tamil. Therefore , the question should be re framed as How did Sinhala people came to Sri Lanka , question has absurd presumption that tamils were migrant population in to sri lanka which is not true , it is sinhalese who are migrant population in to Sri lanka !

            "answer_text": "This is a legitimate question and need to be answered with appropriate evidence to prove \u2014 or disprove \u2014 the early existence/presence of Tamils \u2014 or proto Tamils \u2014 in the island. So, what kind of evidences that can be correlated to prove existence of Tamils in the Island before historical period ? Well of course, inscriptions are not useful in proving presence of Tamils \u2014 or any other ethnic group for that matter \u2014 in island before 260 B.C.E. The knowledge of writing is introduced to India only during regime of Emperor Asoka (Falk 2018 : 63) . Though there are claims for pre-Asokan Brahmi(s) in Tamilakam and Sri Lanka, they are dismissed as inappropriate and mere graffitis without phoenotical values. [There are claims based on AMS dating, Begley(2004 : 521) argues AMS dating for Early Historic dating should be approached cautiously and should be not taken unless there are other evidence that supports it.] Therefore, by going with general consensus , it forces us to rely on archaeological evidence to reconstruct the history of the island before 260 BCE. It seems there was close relation between South India and Sri Lanka during megalithic period, they both used megalithic Black and Red ware , same glass ornaments , food crops , shared burial practices and iron technology (Begley 1967) Archaeologist Vimala Begley(1967) notes, We [Begley et al.] also visited several urn and cist burial sites. They assume a great importance in the archaeology of Ceylon because they show features analogous to those of South India.[1] The urns were earthen pots, large enough for a man in a sitting posture. They varied in size, the largest measuring 4 feet in height and 3 feet 6 inches in diameter. The dead men were placed in a sitting posture in an earthenware pot. The pot was then let into a pit and half filled with sand and rice, and other grains on a tray were placed before the dead man. His stone tools were also inserted at the sides of the pot. The foodstuff and the tools were no doubt, intended for the use of the dead man in his post-mortem life, for they believed in life of the spirit of men after death. The pot is buried under the soil. This kind of practice is common in South India and Sri Lanka. Apart from the burial practice, the people of Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu used same glass for beads \u2014 and other jewellery (Dussubieux et al. 2010) . They used a type of soda-lime Aluminium glass for manufacturing glass ornaments all over Tamilakam and Sri Lanka (Dussubieux & Gratuze 2013:404)(Saxc\u00e9 2015 : 61\u20132). German Archaeologist H. Weisshaar (2015 : 208) states that, They [Sri Lankans] used Black and Red Ware (BRW) as in TamilNadu or Kerala, followed similar customs when they buried their dead in megalithic cemeteries, they used the same glass beads for jewellery and imported carnelian from the mainland[India]. The symbols inscribed in the vessels from Kodumanal \u2014 an early historic cum-Industrial site in Tamil Nadu \u2014 showed immense similarities with those found in the Island as jointly demonstrated by prof. K Rajan and O.Bopearachchi[2][3] Saxc\u00e9 ( 2015: 60) says these symbols suggests close social and even close political and economic links between Tamil Nadu and southern Sri Lanka. The crop package of Sri Lanka and South India is same as noted by Murphy et al. 2018. The crop package patterns of Sri Lanka and South India includes, rice, millets , cotton, coconuts and others seems to share close similarities. Kantharodai, as one of Sri Lanka's four most important historic sites,appears to have a similar, parallel economic and urbanized development to other early south Indian and Sri Lankan urban centres such as Anuradhapura and Magama at the end of the Protohistoric period. During the Early Historic period, Sri Lanka was connected with the wider Indian Ocean with archaeological evidence of regular trade relations with the rest of South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean world. The archaeobotanical assemblage recovered from Kirinda and Kantharodai does not demonstrate speci\ufb01c trade organization but does suggest connectivity between Southern India and Sri Lanka as they possess a similar crop package. (Murphy et al. 2018 : 12) Therefore, these evidences may be taken as early contact between South India \u2014 more precisely Tamilakam \u2014 and Sri Lanka and suggests early presence of South Indians in Island. How did the first Tamil people come to Sri Lanka ? The first arrival Tamil speaking people is may not precisely known. However, their arrival, in all likelihood, pre-dates the Indo-Aryans into island. The proto-Tamils must have arrived during beginning of Iron Age. The Indo-Aryans, in any means , are not autochthonous to the Subcontinent leave alone the island. The Arrival of Indo-Aryans into Indian subcontinent is dated around 1900 BCE , not directly ,from Kurgan culture of central Asia. This hypothesis is called Kurgan Theory. This theory, nevertheless, later revised into Steppe Hypothesis ( Anthony 2007). In fact, this is the most prefered theory among the ones that concerns about origin and diffusion of Indo-European language. From the Archaeological evidence , one can reconstruct following history : ** Presence of ancestors of Vedda people ** Around 1000 BCE : Arrivals of proto-Tamils from Deccan into Island and they do bring burial practices, food crops, iron and steel technology, and Black and Red ware. Around 500 BCE: Arrivals of Indo-Aryan men and they certainly did not replaced the people of Island. They do intermix with the local Tamils and non-Dravidic groups, and Tamils \u2014 and others\u2014 starts to speak Prakrits through Prakritisation. 1000 BCE to 300 BCE : Lord Siva-Phallus worship is major religion among the people (Maloney 1970 : 608-9). BC 500 : Emergence of urban settlements of Anuradhapura, Tissamaharama, Kandarodai (Jaffna) and Mantai. Vibrant commerce/exchanges between Tamil ports and Lankan ports. BC 262 : Emperor Ashoka sent Buddhist missionaries to Island and local rulers embrace Buddhism, and introduction of script into the island. BC 35: Pali Canon committed to writing in fourth Buddhist council at the island. CE 100 : Indo-Roman Trade. Reference : Falk, Harry 2018 : The Creation and Spread of Scripts in Ancient India.

            "answer_text": "Here I like to say my ideas about Sri Lanka Tamils by the basis of practical points . First, land of Lemuria or Kumari kandam should be a myth according to my vision . The only reference for the land is ancient Tamil poems , Those how studied about Tamil poems might know about how Tamil poets exegirate the things for the description, Eg . King Cholas elephant place the foot in kachi ,vanchi ,madurai and it thing that where to place the other foot ..So, in my view they are saying the land we lost after the ice age period  This thing is clearly indicating there was a land connection between Sri Lanka and India , that land might or might not have the thenmadhurai . For more reinforcement,the land Poompuhar that Tamil people lost ,still 100\u2013500 away from the Tamil Nadu coastal region . 2. Second thing is who are the native of India ?  I hope everyone accept that non ariyan people are the natives of India , who are living in Indian subcontinent more than 5000 years or even more . So non Aryan people who we speak Dravidian language are the native people of north India , south India and Sri lanka . That language might be a pro Tamil language which is similar to current day Tamil .  Aryan people invasion o to the India was accepted by many people by so many evidence .And Sri lankan historical Bible book Mahavansa and Deepavansa also saying Aryan people are coming from the north India and marring people in native Sri Lanka and south India (Pandiyan ) .  The map which I uploaded above can clearly saying everything..  This is Kuveni , the princess of Lankas native group called yaksa( \u0b87\u0baf\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb0\u0bcd). Arab people names people with black skin as yaksa . I think the Aryan how speaks paali which is a branch language of Sanskrit and pro Tamil language spoken by lankan natives mixed and the pro sinhala language Ellu formed during 3ed century B.C to 3 ed century AD . That language reinforce by Bhuddist literature by the time , that from the beautiful Sinhala language which is the most contaminated Aryan language by Dravidian language.  Ooops , Tamil language born in 4 th century BC , so people who lived in south India and Sri Lanka might speaks Tamil . So my answer for the question is Tamil people and sinhala people aren't the native of Sri Lanka . Native people are the one who speaks protamil language and now they mixed up with sinhala and Tamil community. Tamils are not came from south India by \u201ckallathoni\u201d(\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd\u0bb3\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bcb\u0ba3\u0bbf) , we came here by our own foot before the Sinhalese how came by Royal ship  . Sorry , I couldn't includ some points here because of my poor English skill , if you have any doubts and clarification leave a comment below . ",

( Thai Puma pumi = Mother Land / Mother Earth), ( Thaven Naku= Devan Tounge) ( Pakal= Day time) ( Moll= daughter)( Nall= Day) ( Poya= Fullmoon day/ only in Srilanka they use this word), ( Tuku = carry) ( Thun = Cement Stone/ post) , lot more Tamil words, (In Srilanka Lanka Su tamis lived) After, Ice age/ flood in Ancient Sumerian/Egypt, people moved to East( Srilanka) What Sumerian/ Ellam Tamilan, almost same , Language still, Srilankan Tamils Talking ,Similar,Sumerian Cuneiform also Similar to Tamil Curi Eedu. Next, ( Un Anna = Your Brother, ) ( Un Moll = Your Daughter), ( Umai = True, this< umai spocken by - Httitian / Hurrian / Elamist/ Akkadian/ Sumerian/ lot Cilivization >), and some of ancient Sumerian Cities still in North Srilanka , for example-( KARA NAKA= Kara Nager/ Blackcity - in Srilanka two places called called ( KARA NAKAR ),North and East, because the ancient ( KARA Nak, ) people had travelled in two different katumarann, so one had gone to Nort and other group was in East landed, Mayan Mesoamerican ( Tamil) had some words what Mayan not used, ( Tollilali= Labor), ( Pathala logam= Undergrad world), ( Palathaku = Mayan & Sumerian, ) ( Caste. Both Cilivization had, ) but in Srilanka after (30,year fighting) no more cast, ( Appa/ Appan = both Cilivization called), so against I tell the Mayan has gone , Srilanka from, east or north. ( Mayan food / ROTI , that get in Srilanka today also, ) ( next Kothu Roti- one of best fast food inched world,) same time ( Sumerian food -NITHU- that also in North Srilanka can get it) that means Ancient Ellam/ Elamist/ Sumerian was Now days -Tamils, no comment, ",

            "answer_text": "50,000 years ago, it was one Tamil land then.  Even 15,000 years ago Mainland India and Srilanka were connected by land. Last glacial period Sea level was down by 100 meters then. 5000 years ago, Sea level was around 60 meter. Part of the land was submerged but still, both were connected. Only 2000 years ago, both got completely separated. Fully developed Tamil literature and Tamil pottery epigraphs found dates back to 500 BC. That means Tamil had a tradition at least 1000 ( 1500 BC - 3500 years back ) years more. So, Tamils didn\u2019t arrive in SL from some other place. It is their native place always. The question would have been even more interesting if the Question was How and when Sinhalese came from North India to Sri Lanka. ",

According to Muslim scholar - Ibn Battula who visited India around 1200s and an existing map in European museum (I think in Portugal), this land-bridge was a functional causeway until around mid-1300s until a cyclone swept through the region and made the causeway unusable. Today, the causeway looks like this :  Small formations of coral islands which look like natural formation, when in fact, it was a bridge constructed and used in the ancient times. South India Tamil people used to go to Sri Lanka and come back for a long time and it is possible many of them had stayed in Sri Lanka and form a new community there which exists as Sri Lankans today.

            "answer_text": "The problem with the common argument that the original inhabitants of Sri Lanka were Tamil is that linguistically the evidence isn\u2019t there. There are phonemes in Sinhala and Sri Lankan Tamil that never appeared in southern India, namely the \u201cae\u201d vowel (explaining why SL Tamils spell some names differently from Indian Tamil i.e. Dharmeratnam vs Dharmaratnam and Jeyaraj vs Jayaraj). Given that this vowel isn\u2019t used in any Indo-Aryan or Dravidian language except possibly Kashmiri, it most likely originated with the pre-Sinhala/Tamil inhabitants. Furthermore there are a number of Sinhala words that have neither Indo-Aryan nor Dravidian origin. Again, they are probably remnants of the original language of SL. ",
