            "answer_text": "What if the future age started in the Stone Age? Well\u2026 it\u2019s impossible to make a prediction about this until you explain some things to us: First, what does \u201cstarted in the Stone Age\u201d even mean? Do you mean a post-apocalyptic future scenario where we\u2019ve regressed that far in technology? If so, that\u2019s been done to death by science fiction. Do you mean \u201cthe Stone Age was when we got a concept of past/present/future\u201d? You\u2019ll have to talk to a paleontologist, but humans almost certanily already had that concept during the Stone Age, and possibly even earlier - a tribe of Homo Habilis would need that concept in order to build other concepts like \u201cthe hunting grounds we seek are 2 day\u2019s journey from here\u201d. And we know that Neanderthals probably had a concept not only of \u201cfuture\u201d but even \u201cafterlife\u201d due to their use of grave goods when burying the dead. (Think about it - making a really good flint knife is a *lot* of effort, and unless you think that Ogg will still be needing it, you\u2019re not going to bury it with Ogg - you\u2019d swipe it because Ogg is obviously not going to ever use it again in *this* life) Or are you using it as \u201cpast/present/future doesn\u2019t work the way we think it does\u201d, in which case you\u2019ll have to explain how it *does* work before we can extrapolate what that ends up doing?

            "answer_text": "Interesting question and, in my opinion, it is a very real possibility. There are so many environmental or human-created events that could very well knock humanity back into a \u2018Stone Age\u2019 condition Take your pick -Super Volcano (VEI 8 or larger) -Coronal Mass Ejection (solar flare) -Super virus -Rogue asteroid or meteorite impact -Nearby Supernova -Crop famines -Nuclear conflict The effects would be varied, based on the severity of the event. Eventually, if humans could still maintain a base population (say 10,000 breeding pairs), we should recover. ",
