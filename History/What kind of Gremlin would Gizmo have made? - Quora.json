            "answer_text": "Well, to answer this we can look at a previous concept from Gremlins 2. Lenny, a Gizmo spawn with bucked teeth, is presented as pretty much indifferent and goofy. He was spawned along with George and Mohawk, who boss Lenny around. He follows the orders of his fellow Mogwai and later becomes a Gremlin. Originally, he was supposed to betray George and Mohawk when they became Gremlins in order to protect Gizmo. This means that somewhere down the line, those who worked on Gremlins 2 imagined that his more mellow personality would still be present as a Gremlin. I believe the same would apply to Gizmo, as he is one of the few Mogwai who would not intentionally undergo the transformation. It is hard to say if this same scenario would play out, but I believe that\u2019s the case. We can also look at Gizmo\u2019s fellow Mogwai that did undergo the transformation. Let\u2019s start with Stripe. Stripe is immediately depicted as a leader, but he also shows great signs of aggression. When he transforms, he is still just as aggressive, one could say his Mogwai personality was much like his Gremlins one. So, let\u2019s get into the New Batch, who have very distinct personality traits. Mohawk, who is a reincarnated version of Stripe, is vicious and vengeful as a Mogwai and a Gremlin. However, Lenny and George have traits that aren\u2019t typical of every Gremlin. George is serious and grumpy, which is not a trait of a Gremlin. When he transforms, he retains this trait. Then there is Lenny. How he ACTUALLY turned out is different from his concept. Lenny was just as bad as the other Mogwai, but was doofy and clumsy. He retains both of these traits upon turning into a Gremlin. However, one might say he is a lot more aggressive as a Gremlin. Daffy, who is pretty much a lunatic, retains this personality upon transforming. Gizmo\u2019s distinct personality is that he is sweet and humble. Gizmo would probably retain these traits as a Gremlin, but perhaps he would struggle with his new transformation. He might initially be vicious and not know what he was doing. In George Gipe\u2019s novel, Gizmo makes it evident that the transformation does somewhat warp the mind of the one undergoing it. Gizmo is really the only Mogwai we see that is inherently good as a Mogwai. Most of the other ones were bad. Overall I think Gizmo would remain good, but might act like a typical Gremlin at first until he realizes his mind is being warped. He may act as some neutral animals in films such as Jurassic Park, where he might be a vicious beast with Gremlins tendencies, but he will go against the rest of his species\u2019 evil plans. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat kind of Gremlin would Gizmo have made?\u201d According to semi-canonical lore, Gizmo is an ideal Mogwai, which is why he won\u2019t eat after midnight. He knows what will happen and doesn\u2019t want it to. So he just won\u2019t do it. But if it were forced on him\u2026 he\u2019d probably be as bad as your average Gremlin, but maybe not as smart as a leader (unless he turned into a leader - Gremlins mutate wildly). The big problem overall is that positive Mogwai attributes are genetic and recessive. In other words, an ideal Mogwai will produce offspring that are not quite as good as the original. Of course, in the first movie, that\u2019s straight away. First batch. Gizmo\u2019s spawn are all little hellions. As such, the question I\u2019m more concerned with is why their creator was so incompetent. Mogwai are supposed to be able to adapt and live on any planet\u2026 unless there\u2019s sunlight, and not too much water. *SDMH* And the ideal Mogwai are born sporadically. They\u2019re the statistical exception, not the rule. So most Mogwai are terrible cute monsters who want to become even more terrible hideous monsters. Oh, and did I mention they mutate like crazy? So the majority of Mogwai will not be fuzzy, cute little balls of love, but raging maniacs. Gizmo is adorable. But the whole Mogwai species is messed up, man\u2026 ",
