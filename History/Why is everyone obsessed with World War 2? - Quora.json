            "answer_text": "Two major reasons: It is the last major war between great powers. Thus, it has the most advanced technology, and it is the most recent great war. Anyone older than 50 is almost certainly descended from someone who was alive during the conflict. 30 and older almost certainly has a grandparent. This provides a personal connection, and it means that it directly shaped the world we live in.It is incredibly well documented. 99% of those \u201cother wars\u201d have very little written about them. An entire Bronze Age war, for example, might be summed up in a few lines in some clay tablet. Can\u2019t really be obsessed with a war that vague and unrecorded.World War II on the other hand has records down to the platoon level. I know someone who went through pain-staking effort to read German officer\u2019s logs while building a board game. He had access to battle reports from minor skirmishes. Other than maybe WWI, no large war has been recorded in such detail. Which brings me to three more sub-points 3. It is an international war In the US, I would argue that the Civil War is a very close second to WWII in terms of books, and a more distant second in terms of wargames. However, outside the US, the Civil War greatly drops in popularity. WWII though, involved almost every nation in existence. Everyone has a connection to it. 4. Its tactics are still relevant So many modern military concepts were first used in WWII. All of these tactics still exist today, and are usable. Obviously the exact nature of these weapons systems and tactics has changed, but the broad strokes are the same. Anyone who wants to study how to effectively lead modern militaries would want to look at WWII. 5. Confirmation bias There is other stuff out there (WWI has grown in popularity thanks to the centennial). With the internet, everything else is at your finger tips. I agree, its a pain to go into a small bookstore and have a third of the history books be WWII. But, there is a simple solution. Start voting with your wallet. ",

            "answer_text": "World War 2 covers so many different facets of warfare that people find interesting. First off it was fought all over the globe from tropical paradises of the Pacific to the shores of Alaska to the deserts of Africa to the fields of Europe. The machines of the war fascinate alone. The tanks, planes, ships, submarines, halftracks were used for the first and last time in massive scale. It was the last war to heavily involve Naval warfare and this encompassed two fronts of the Atlantic and Pacific. It's viewed as the \u201cgood\u201d war as the intentions were to free the world from tyranny and oppression. It was fought by the greatest generation that built amazing things and came together in one amazing moment. The generation of Americans that built the war machine and fought it were of a different type than what we could ever imagine today. If WW2 happened today there is no way we would come together the way they did. People are far too selfish now to make the sacrifices this generation made. WW2 involved airborne operations, seaborne invasions, massive tank and aerial battles to go alongside the massive land battles fought by grunts and all these were accomplished by ordinary citizen soldiers. For the military history enthusiast WW2 encompassed it all and the amount of information to discover and learn is literally endless. ",
