            "answer_text": "Schmidt was as a person in his time. Germany needed a strong personality to guide the country through the issues of that time. He did that very well. What made him the greatest Chancellor was his ability to stand up for his opinion even afterwards. Adenauer was good at establishing Germany but lacked the indepence from his old networks and missed a lot of chances to make a difference. Brandt was a great Chancellor too. He started the process of making peace with the Eastern European countries and as such the process to bring the Warsaw Pact down. Kohl was a selfish man who only cared about his legacy and not Germany. He was in office much too long. Merkel is a good Chancellor. She has done a lot for Germany that Germans will only realize when she is gone. But she also is in office too long., Her handling of the Corona crisis so far is very good. She has a hard time working against the issues of a federal structrure with 16 diffeent states with political idiots running them. ",
