            "answer_text": "By the phrase \u201cstart the religion of islam\u201d I think you mean to say when did he started preaching it? Muhammad(PBUH) received his first revelation in 610 AD. He was not used to seeing angels around him, so when Gabriel arrived with the divine message, Muhammad (PBUH) was afraid. So he preached his among his family members. Khadija bin Khuwaylid was the first convert to Islam. Ali ibn Abu Talib was the first male convert. For three years Muhammad(PBUH) preached his message secretly. However one of the converts Abu Bakr started inviting his close friends to Islam and Uthman bin Affan, Talhah bin Ubaydullah, Az Zubayr ibnul Awwam, Saad ibn Abi Waqqas were converted on Abu Bakr\u2019s invitation. It was in 613 AD that Muhammad(PBUH) started preaching in public. He invited the senior Quraysh leaders to Islam. He invited the negro slaves to Islam. The negro slaves started converting in large numbers as Islam gave them the dignity to live as equals in the Arab society. Prominent slave converts were Ammar bin Al Yasir and Bilal ibn Rabah. This prompted the Meccan Quraysh leaders to action. Abu Jahl, Utbah ibn Rabiah, Ummayah ibn Khalaf tortured the early converts. But Islam still came out victorious in the end!!!!! ",

For those who say he started Islam, they need to explain what were the previous prophets preaching? Islam means to voluntary \u201cSubmit\u201d or \u201cSurrender\u201d to the will of God. The term Islam/Muslims was used by prophet Ibrahim as stated in the Quran Surah Al-Haj [22:78]: [It is] the religion of your father, Abraham. He has named you \"Muslims\" before [in former scriptures] and in this [revelation] that the Messenger may be a witness over you and you may be witnesses over the people. Islam is not really a name to be used as a noun to refer to a group of people. It is rather a state of mind. ",
