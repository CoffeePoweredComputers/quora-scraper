            "answer_text": "Czechoslovakia a nation born out of the Treaty of Versailles out of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire. These were two national groups that were considered to be the same apart from a few differences. In 1938, Hitler demanded that Czechoslovakia hand over the so-called Sudetenland because he claimed that the German speaking minority was being persecuted (He lied and they weren\u2019t). At a big conference that ironically there was no real participation from the Czechoslovak Government but lots of input from Germany, Italy, France and Britain (mainly the first two). This conference held in Munich enabled British PM Neville Chamberlain to proclaim \u201cPeace in our time!\u201d when he landed in Britain, privately he knew it meant no such thing and began preparations for war. Czechoslovakia lost the most defensible portion of it\u2019s territory and it was no surprise that Hitler quietly and quickly took the rest in early 1939. A whole generation learnt not to trust the West. After Germany\u2019s defeat in WW2, the soviets took over Czechoslovakia and installed a puppet government loyal to Moscow. Many Czech and Slovak people were deported to Russia and were never heard from again. In 1968, alexander Dubcek became President and began to introduce reforms that he called \u201cSocialism with a Human Face\u201d which began to draw the ire of Moscow who invaded the country much to the outrage of the West. Dubcek\u2019s reforms were wond back and the country was as appressed as ever. At the end of the cold War Czechoslovakia had thrown off it\u2019s communist master with the Velvet Revolution led by playwright Vaclav Havel who became the president with the return of Alexander Dubcek. In 1993, Czechoslovakia dissolved into the Czech Republic (capital Prague) and the Slovak Republic (capital Bratislava). The most notable thing about this split was that there was no violence or war. And that\u2019s what happened to Czechoslovakia. ",

            "answer_text": "Inspite of the central government's efforts to invest in and to industrialize the mostly agricultural nation of Slovakia, over the years the desire of Slovaks to be independent off the Czechs steadily grew. The general feeling was that they were getting the short end of the stick. And they didn't want play a second fiddle any more. So after the \u201cVelvet Revolution\u201d, in the early 90\u2019s, a peaceful separation was negotiated and the Slovak people now have their own country. The two nations now enjoy a close and friendly relationship. ",
