            "answer_text": "Not being a true expert on the matter, I\u2019m going to point you to this article: There Is No Best Sword Very detailed look into why this question is so difficult to answer. I\u2019ll quote a few points: \u201cI want to point out that swords are designed with specific uses in mind. They should be judged this way.\u201d - very true. If you go swinging a rapier like a claymore, then complain it doesn\u2019t cut very well (usually, rapiers don\u2019t even have sharpened edges), well you know less about swords then I do.\u201cI once had a guy pick up one of my swords, a schiavona. I warned him that it was quite sharp, but he assured me that he was quite familiar with swords and actually was quite expert in their use. He then proceeded to go into some katas designed for the katana. Before I could say anything he had drawn the back edge of the sword along his shoulder, cutting a 6-inch gash in his deltoid and arm.\u201d\u201cI have heard people argue over which is the better sword, the rapier or a Viking type, for instance. This is foolish. What they are actually talking about are fighting styles, not swords. Any sword should be discussed only in the context of what it was designed to do.\u201d\u201cThe Abyssinian shotel is a long curved double-edged sword. At first glance, it looks like a Near Eastern scimitar, but on closer inspection you realize that the curve is a full half circle. And it is, I repeat, double-edged. The blade, generally, is a flattened, diamond cross section and quite stiff. The natives fight with these swords from behind large, circular leather shields. Rather than try to cut through the shield, or feint it out of the way, they reach around it to hook their opponent with the point of the sword. I think you can image what a strange type of combat it must be.\u201d\u2026. and it goes on and on really, explaining he constant battle between armor and sword, which eventually ended when swords became less practical for breaking through platemail than axes, maces, and warhammers. He also points out that we can never answer this question because we now have guns. The latest designs for swords, are the latest because we stopped developing them, and we stopped developing swords because we had guns. So yeah, it\u2019s a difficult question to answer. But let\u2019s say you, the modern average Joe, need a sword. No idea what kind of combat you\u2019ll be getting into, what armor your opponent is wearing, and what the terrain is like. So a random opponent is charging you over random terrain, wearing random armor, for random reasons. Here are my top choices: A phone with 911 on speed dial and a pair of good running shoes. F*ck that guy.A loaded gun. Seriously, f*ck that guy.Something light (\u201cOnly a 2 to 3 pound sword should be considered for modern use; nothing heavier will achieve the velocity needed, nor will a heavier sword maneuver, parry or recover fast enough.\u201d), fast, with a wide flat blade (so you can deflect attacks more easily) and \u201crelatively short and straight enough for a serious thrust\u201d. I think a short saber or pointed machete would work.So, something light and simple, and meant primarily for one handed use. So you can use your other hand to pick up something to use as a shield (not sure trash can lid will work, frying pan might), to grab your opponent and maybe claw at his eyes, or to pick up the gun and shoot him. Seriously, f*ck that guy. \u201cMost well-made swords did their jobs well, but there never was an all-around sword. Judge them that way, each in its own context -- there is no best.\u201d Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "I understand what you're asking, and I know you're looking for an answer that doesn't have a bunch of caveats, but the other responders are right that this is a question whose real answer DOES require a lot of caveats.  That's one of the reasons it keeps getting asked: there is no definitive answer.  However, let me try to answer with as few caveats as possible.I'm going to assume a FEW things here.  The first is that you're only asking about lethality, not convenience.  The second is that companion weapons aren't allowed: no off-hand shields, daggers, pistols, etc.  And finally, that no horses are allowed.  Within those constraints, if you had to pick only one sword to defend yourself with, and you could have mastery of that sword downloaded into your brain Matrix style, with absolutely no foreknowledge of how many opponents you would have to face, what equipment they would have, or in what environs you would have to fight, I do think there is a clear answer.  That answer is the greatsword, whatever that means for your culture: nodachi, zweihander, montante, spadone, changdao, whatever.The reason for this is simple: if you can only have one weapon, and convenience is not a factor, you want a primary weapon, not a sidearm.  Imagine asking this question about guns.  If you could have only one gun to defend yourself with, and knew nothing about when and where you would need to use it, or against whom, would you pick a pistol?  Or argue about which TYPE of pistol was best for your needs?  Of course not.  You'd pick a rifle of some sort.  Greatswords are the sword equivalent of a rifle.  They are the only types of sword that were carried as primary weapons, rather than as a backup to a larger and more capable weapon such as a polearm.  In fact, in European military manuals, greatswords were treated as polearms for purposes of discussing how troops should be armed.  Greatswords beat wearable swords in almost every category.  They are incredibly fast, have enormous reach, can attack from many angles, deal well with multiple opponents, strike with great percussive force against armor, and have the momentum and leverage to make them extremely difficult to deflect, let alone block.  In narrow confines, their great reach lets them act like a spear.  At close quarters they are highly effective wrestling aids.  It is true that in highly specific circumstances other bladed weapons might be better.  If you want to assassinate someone, a knife would be better.  Likewise if you have to fight in a shower stall.  If you need a free hand to hold someone, a one-handed sword of some sort would be the way to go.  And of course the very thing that makes greatswords so effective makes them impossible to wear.  But for maximum effectiveness against the totally unknown, no sword is better.Unless you're on a horse, of course, in which case you need a hand to help manage your mount.  You CAN ride without a hand on the reins, but mounted hand to hand combat is first about maneuvering the horse and only secondarily about the weapons, so anything that gives you more maneuverability is good.  Which restricts us to one-handed swords.  Which means you want a straight or only very slightly curved saber, because you want maximum reach (hence we discount all the short-bladed one-handed swords), maximum hand protection (as we are assuming no shields), and maximum versatility (hence a straight or nearly straight type).  A highly curved saber will be more devastating against unarmored targets, but we are assuming that your opponent might be ANYTHING, including a heavily armored man against whom you would want to thrust.So there you go.  Greatsword on foot, cut-and-thrust saber on horse.Addendum: if one can arrive at a definitive answer like that, how come people used other swords?  And how come I said the question has no answer?Because the assumptions I laid out are deeply abstract.  In real life, you DO make assumptions about when, how, where, and against whom you will use a sword.  And you DO care about things like wearability.  If I am a pikeman, very clearly I do not need ANOTHER primary weapon; what I need is something wearable - a sidearm.  If I am a cavalry trooper in an era when cavalry have significant unarmored body parts, I may not worry about needing to thrust into gaps.  If I am a man in the Bronze Age, the metallurgy of my time is incapable of producing a functional greatsword.  And so on. ",
