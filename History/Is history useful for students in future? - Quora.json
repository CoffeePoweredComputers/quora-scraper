I myself was not key admirer of this subject until I discovered the treasures it kept safe underneath it. history , being prejudiced to only dates make me feel so anxious n yet so astonished that people so easily take this subject for granted. so did u ever think why another cold war never happened or why for that matter u still enjoy all the liberties n some people out there like Myanmar\u2019s people are still fighting to enjoy the democracy we are so lucky to have.simply look at the fund. rights u have which u have inherited from ur forefathers. that all accounts history, but, as I may say in the accustomed way. so just delve ur mind further and deep down you will see that this subject teaches morality,friendship,treachery,espionage n we all try to learn something n adopt others like the ravishing arch. marvels of our ancestors. so keep loving n liking it.that\u2019s it!!!!!!
