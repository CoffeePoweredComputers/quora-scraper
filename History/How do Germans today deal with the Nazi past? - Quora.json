            "answer_text": "I literally just got back to the U.S.A. after visiting nine cities in Germany. One was Nuremberg where I went on a guided tour of Zeppelin Field, the Documentation Museum, and Courtroom 600 which was used in \"Nuremberg Trials.\" Our tour guide was excellent, but his entire tour was more or less centered around trying to explain how normal, everyday German citizens were duped into both supporting, and fighting for the National Socialists (Nazi) cause. He was concerned with this, because he wanted to think nice thoughts, and honor both his parents, and his grand parents, while still completely disagreeing with what they did. That is a tough conundrum. He did this by admitting the past, while simultaneously condemning it, and explaining to the tourists how a normal person could be persuaded to commit the atrocities that they did. He started by explaining that the people were poor, in a huge economic depression, and basically unhappy with the current government. Then telling us how a charismatic leader came in, and said he would find them jobs, put food on the table, and restore their national identity to something they could be proud of. Sounds good right?? At the same time, what they didn't know, is that elections were being fixed, and media was being manipulated so that the propaganda Germans heard was that everybody was against them, and that Hitler was the only one that could save them... also good, when you add that you just got a new job, and finally had a pay check. Next, they would take, and brainwash your children, put all males in the military, and basically force them to do their will. It's hard to work against a government that your husband and child are fighting for.... you don't want to see them die. How did they get their soldiers to actually commit the murders and fight? They would take an 18 year old to a foreign country, where everybody is trying to kill him. They put a Jew in front of him, and tell him that this isn't a real person. That he is responsible for all the hardship you are enduring. Then they tell him to shoot his this Jew because he is an enemy... You don't want to do it?? That's fine, you don't have to, you will just have to take off your uniform, go out into this foreign land on your own, and fend for yourself with no food, no weapons, and you can never come back to your own country again, because you are a traitor. Hopefully without you, your family will be ok. Is there really a choice? You pull the trigger. And every time you pull it, you pull it for your family, and you convince yourself you are doing the right thing. And every time, it gets a little easier, especially since all the other soldiers are doing the same thing. That is how you dupe a population into committing the worst atrocities on Earth. It's been done before (Pol-Pot). It's being done right now (North Korea). It will be done again in the future. Again, this was an excellent tour guide. Very powerful. The entire above example was delivered (much more eloquently) to me while sitting in Courtroom 600. By the end, the guide was holding back tears, trying to understand the dilemma HIS ancestors had to face... and the shame that brought to his people now. This is how he dealt with it, by helping people like me understand how it can be done. ",

            "answer_text": "The Germans do not deny their ugly past, they teach all of it in school at a fairly young age, because if you don\u2019t acknowledge the worst with the good parts of your history, you may be doomed to repeat the atrocities. The rise of the Nazis was not much different from what is currently going on in the USA; bigoted people promote hatred of people of different race(s), in the name of national pride and reclaiming all the assets in the nation for the majority population, and when they come to power, that is exactly what they do, take resources that belong to others and incarcerate the prior owners or deport them. Hitler, too, talked about restoring his nation\u2019s past glory, and a huge number of people who never thought of themselves as haters rallied to that banner, but instead of glory, Hitler led his nation into its greatest shame. The lesson to be learned is that we must treat all people as we wish to be treated, and that a nation can\u2019t truly be great as long as there are some people regarded as second class citizens and deprived of rights that others are granted. There are actually a lot of people in the USA that do not know of our nation\u2019s worst atrocities, or disbelieve them, beginning with the often genocidal acts that were used to displace the native americans from their lands, the importation of slaves from Africa to make wealthy landowners even wealthier, and centuries of lynching their descendants to keep them living in fear, even after they were nominally free, and then during WWII taking the property of Japanese-Americans and incarcerating their families, and now we are ripping away the parents of young hispanic-american US citizens and deporting them to their country of origin, even if they are in danger in those countries. This is what happens when you do not teach the ugly parts of your nation\u2019s history in school, it makes it too easy for your people to repeat the mistakes of bigotry and hatred. White supremacists have been verbally inciting violence with their speech publicly, resulting in at least one young woman protestor being killed, and they try to claim first amendment protections that are not supposed to be possible when people are advocating (inciting) violence, but they are not being prosecuted because our nation tolerates hate speech and haters because we don\u2019t see the slippery slope to genocide that puts us onto. We have a lot to learn from the Germans about how to deal with an ugly past. ",

            "answer_text": "HERMANN GOERING was a nice, humorous guy, a dedicated family man, as many of the leading Nazis. Make no mistake about it, they were no psychopaths, no sociopaths, they were people like you and me. Millions of Germans were nice people in the Third Reich with whom you could have a lot of fun, go for a beer, have a party, lovely people. The same people cheered Hitler, followed his promise of \"Lebensraum im Osten\", (land in the East), nothing you have to pay for when you kill and subdue the peoples there. The high-culture citizens of Weimar, the town of Goethe, Schiller and other German literature heroes, the town Hitler liked most, said to General Patton, they knew nothing about Concentration Camp Buchenwald which they called \"Workshops Buchenwald\" where people were killed by slave labor for their high-cultural pleasantries. A most vicious euphemism. They all lied, collectively, as we know today. You cannot detect the evil in a human face, but only by its deeds. The evil has many disguises. The evil is not easy to be defeated, if ever. The spirit of the defeated evil can hide and come back again. The most contributors who answered this question, are in favor of a better, chastened Germany. I am not convinced. Please look at my observations and theses: Seamless transition Third Reich into Germany of today: Adenauer, the first Chancellor after WW2: He integrated 90 percent of the old Nazi cliques in administrations into the new republic. He was interested in a functioning state and didn't care about the political mindsets. He installed as his chief of staff his personal friend ....Josef Maria Globke. This guy has written the race laws for the Nazis which meant gruesome death for millions. He succeeded in avoiding the Nuremberg Trials and due to Adenauer, he became a most powerful person. In several European countries, he was sentenced to death, the U.S. wanted him. But Germany doesn't extradite its criminals.Denazification 1: I belong to the first generation after the war which had lessons about the Third Reich. All classmates were bored because no one of us was in the war as a soldier or had killed Jews. My estimate: of 1.000 students, about 3 were interested in the issue and felt a kind of a responsibility for the past of \"our\" nation. About 0,3 percent.Denazification 2: Until the 1970ies, more than 50 percent of leading state officials in the federal justice department were former members of the Nazi party.Albert Speer, the so-called \"good Nazi\": After 20 years being released from the prison, he committed new crimes by selling confiscated, stolen Jewish property (art) secretively on the art markets. He died peacefully in London in a brothel. At a minimum, his accomplice, a gallery owner in Cologne, could have been trialed. Instead, this guy got a professorship.I stop here, the list could easily go in the hundreds. But what was the learning, did the Germans really change? Or did they simply play nice to get out of the crosshairs of the new world conscience? I have no final sufficient answer, but here some of my observations: Greece: 1946 Germany was sentenced in Paris to reparations for Greece. Not as blood-money for the genocide, but for the devastations the German army and SS corps committed during the occupation and reign of terror. Germany never paid its obligations and - I say - never intended to pay, using abstruse arguments. The sum including interests must be about $500 billion today. Do you recall how merciless the Germans bashed Greece in the recent debt crisis? Though they did not pay a dime until now as you can read in \u201cThe Second World War Is Not Over Yet\u201d[1]NATO: Germany does not fulfill its NATO obligations. All in all, they are 45 billion short in defense and intelligence agencies spendings every year. The deficit in spending is about 15 percent of the annual national budget. Germany does use it for \"free\" education, social and ecological projects. The Germans rely for their national security on nations who comply with the rules, like the U.S. or Greece. It is fair to say, rich Germany freeloads on the costs of others, also poor nations.Volkswagen: William Boston, a renewed American journalist, engaged in the coverage of VW said in a ZDF (German state television) interview analogous: They do this (cheating) since decades, they were never held accountable. If the vigilant Americans would not have intervened, the Diesel crime would never have found the way to the public. The governmental agency for cars (Kraftfahrzeug Bundesamt) is best connected in the industry, knows everything. Why didn't they find nothing?Economical behavior on the markets: How does Germany manage to have an \"eternal\" trade surplus, while the Germans invent nothing, innovate nothing since decades? Are they so \"superior\"? I say, among others, they use unfair methods. The German government is taxes-addicted as the Germans are subsidies-addicted. The government would collapse quickly if there would be no trade-surplus. So the participants installed a so-called \"Sozialpartnerschaft\" (social partnership), a collusion of corporations, unions, government. \"Social\" sounds good, but one purpose is to decrease the prices of German products on the global markets, to undersell competitors. I call this \"unfair business\"; a stronger wording would be \"conspiracy\". Currently, the best-known example of \"Sozialpartnerschaft\" is a busted cartel of the big German automakers.I stop here again, this list could be very much longer indeed. Conclusion: Do not fool yourself by being uncritical about Germany. Niklas Frank, the son of the infamous \"butcher of Poland\" Hans Frank, sentenced to death in Nuremberg, said recently, \"Do not trust us\". He still suffers from the German past, his father's legacy. He is one of those most honorable personalities who really show responsibility for their nation though having no personal guilt. He argues, if the Germans would lose their economic edge, they could change for the worse. There is a German saying: \"Hitler was no accident\". I finish this posting with a valediction I use for my Germany-addicted American friends: \"Like them (the Germans) if you would, but never ever trust them\".

            "answer_text": "Most german citizens will say that they don't have ancestors who participated in the atrocities. Most will say that almsot nobody knew anything, or they found out to late.Even if you didn't know anything the concentration camps or such, there is enough reason to have fought the Nazis \u2013 then and now. Why else did Georg Elser try to kill Hitler? Most didn't want to admit to that, so he was ignored and put into a wrong context.Usually you learn about the crimes of the Nazis, but often the Wehrmacht is described in more neutral words, as if they had a clean record.People like Beate Klarsfeld are not widely known, their work is rejected.Most german citizens could have known quite early that something really bad was going on in the east against the Jews, even that there was organized killing. One reason for this belief is the Reichsbahn as the largest employer. Every German should at least have known one person working on or with the trains, and at least some of them would have talked about the transports \u2013 that's exactly how the people who admit to have known mostly found out. Even nowadays a son of an locomotive driver tells me that they didn't know. Besides that, the jewish population was well integrated, and people realized that there schoolmate was missing. They even were witness to the deportation of e.g. her godmother with her family. My ancestors knew!The atrocities against Sinti and Roma, Kommunists, against homosexuals where widely tolerated, I heard people say in the sixties and later that that was something Hitler did right. Even nowadays you will find people who are not condemning these deportations and killings.In my opinion there is to much about the guilt in general, in an unpersonalized way, and not enough about the way to fight what's wrong, not enough examples of people who did fight, as that would cause more responsibility for the cowards. There where people who did their utmost to stay human, some of which where honored as \"Righteous\". So you could have fought back, and we should have, that's the reason for our guilt, not that the regime did something \u2013 the majority of our  ancestors tolerated it knowingly. People who want to uncover and want to name the crimes and victims like Beate Klarsfeld are ignored and even fought.Nothing is said about the modern and growing antisemitism.In my opinion Germany and the german citizens have a problem with tolerance which mutates to undecidedness, therefore they tolerate extremist groups like Salafists, and don't react then basic freedom is endangered. The so called war against terrorism robbed us of many important liberties, that will pave the way to the next totaliarism. Good luck to us! ",

            "answer_text": "The Holocaust, from beginning to end, in all its eugenic ferocity murdered 11 million people. The Shoah portion of that covers the murder of 6m Jews. It gets all the press. What gets all the press is the \"work camps\".  What should get the press is the two year rampage between 1939 and 1941 across central and eastern europe where the Einsatzgruppen went around murdering jews one bullet at a time. 2 million people were murdered one at a time until such time as the more humane and efficient \"work camp\" method was devised. That's not killing two million people by dropping bombs from 30,000 feet, that's looking at them in the eye, and pulling the trigger. One at a time. Now lets discuss the other 44m people the germans murdered. Ahhh but you say half of those were blood red soviet communists. True, and now lets discuss the differences between National Socialism (Hitler) and International Socialism (Stalin). Personally I see the same totalitarianism. I see Hegel. I see the same protestant intolerance. I see the same spirit nailing its \"points\" on the church door insisting that \"I am logically right, and therefore if you disagree you must be logically wrong\". I see the same Karl Marx making efficiency arguments and viewing history from a materialist perspective. I see the same materialist, idealist, eugenic argument made by Bolshevics (another 50m murders) as by Maoists (another 50m). That is Germany's cultural heritage, genocides 50m at a pop. I see the same eugenic arguments been made today. I see them every time I look at the cover of Der Spiegel and can read a good explanation as to why \"my people\" are inferior to the german people.  Now lets discuss the fact that all four of my grandparents and both my parents had at one point in their lives have to run away from german soldiers. The point here is that they have not forgotten. And since they (later in life) decided to \"tell their story\", its also part of \"my story\". Their terror is also my terror, not because I am afraid but because I understand why when they close their eyes they are afraid.  So the comments on the part of \"modern day germans\" that its \"history\" cannot be allowed to stand. Its their parents and grandparents who murdered 55m people. Its blood on their hands. Its my story, and its their story. Its our story.  After the war it was decided that it was better to have the \"spear men\"(Ger= spear; Man=man) in the tent pissing out rather than outside the tent pissing in. It took Helmut Kohl twenty years to convince europeans that the spear men could be trusted. It took Merkel one administration to prove to everybody that everybody was wrong; the Germans simply cannot be trusted. That is my story. Lets add that up: my grandparents story, my parent's story plus my story. That is the present tense. Not seventy years ago. Today. So please spare me the \"Nazi History\" Chapter. Its not a chapter, its not German history, its our history, its our today.  Its also French, Polish, Hungarian, Rumanian, Ukranian and Russian history. Its Belgian history. Its Dutch History. Its Italian History. Its Australian and Canadian History. And its my personal story. Its why my father called me an asshole when I bought a german car. The Germans don't get to define it as \"Nazi History\". Its their story as well, but they choose to say it was a chapter in an otherwise illustrious history. It was not a chapter, it was and is a five hundred year cultural revolt against european civilization. Its five hundred years of continuous war.  Its why the French don't have any fight left in them. They got savaged three times between the Franco Prussian War of 1870, WWI and WWII. Its why Holland reaches for his ankles when the Chancellor lands in Paris.  So lets not confront germans with \"history\" (our story, their chapter). Lets confront germans for what they are today: Germans. And Merkel has a 70% approval rate. That's like saying \"there were 20,000 work camps in Germany during the war but \"nobody knew what went on there...\".  This is the reason why I had to write this piece: {Marco Bremer, Entrepreneur#65 upvotes by Oliver Emberton, Roman Sitelew, Judith Meyer, (more)I am German and let me be clear about this: I have no Nazi past. The question is meaningless.} With all due respect, Marco to Marco, you do have a German Past. Your German, and I cannot get past that fact. I still remember the sheer terror in my grand mother's eyes when a German tourist crossed the road in front of us, and stepped on the side walk three paces in front of her. She nearly broke my hand she squeezed so hard. That is what this 6 year old Marco remembers. ",

            "answer_text": "I`m from Germany and I agree with the answers that were given. Today every child learns in School about the Holocaust and about Nazi German. It`s a big theme and in history we`re learning about a hlaf year or more about what happened. In the same year we took an excursion to on of the Conzentration camp and one of the survivers talked about it in class and told us his story. Sadly he died two years ago but the School has still one day to commemorate him and his live story. Also everyone watches in class a movie called \"Schindler`s Liste\". It`s an old movie which tells the true Story of Schindler and the Jews. He was one of the Nazis too, but changed his opinion about the jews when he saw what really happened to them. With the help of his company he saved many Jews from getting murdered. Sure, he wasn`t really a good man but at least he tried and saved many thousand lives. He isn`t seen as a hero or something like that in Germany but the movie and this story shows that there were People who at least tried to help the Jews at this times. I think exactly this is one of the reasons why this movie is shown in history class; to show what happened in the past and to prevent that something like this happens again. So in our hole Society the Holocaust is still a big theme but we`re not really ashamed, because we`re a different Generation and what happened in the past isn`t our fault... but we`re very sad and shocked about These things that happened in the history of Germany. But we/I think that we have at least one duty, not only the german but also this whole world, it\u00b4s our duty to prevent that something like this ever happens again, in this hole world. Many thousand People died, just because the Society of a hole Country was manipulated to believe such things. And this isn`t something that happened for the first or for the last time. Even today there are communities where People are geting manipulated to do or believe things that aren`t real... but that things like this happen aren`t the fault of just on person, there are many others that are involved too, but also with everyone that is against this Happening there is a more less Chance of something like this to happen again. I think it`s very good that the society talks about things like this but I think that we shouldn`t insist on the things that happened in the past. We should go out and do something about the things that are happening in this world now to prevent things like this and to learn from the past... And sorry for my bad english... I`m not leraning to speak it that Long but I hope you`re understanding what I wanted to say. XD ",

            "answer_text": "Many of the answers here are from Germans, as is appropriate because the question is about German life and how everyday Germans deal with the history of Nazi Germany, but unfortunately, they are all a bit too humble in my opinion. I am not criticizing the answers of Judith Meyer Holger Nahm Martin Thoma etc. in any way because there is something that is correct about the lack of pride demonstrated in their answers about the ways that they describe dealing with the guilt of the past. However, there is something missing in their answers also, and even though it is not 100% pertinent to your question, it should be mentioned. Not being German, I am not restrained by the idea that pointing out this fact would be somehow glorifying Germany. Quite the contrary, as an American who has his share of family members who fought in WW2 against the Nazis, I think I can safely praise Germany\u2019s efforts to reconcile the new Germany with the horrors of the Nazi Regime of the old Germany. In fact, I am humbled by Germany\u2019s public remembrance and regret for the horrors of the past and I wish that my own country had at least a semblance of such integrity. What is missing from the answers, is this: There is no country that I know of that has done more to symbolize and memorialize its national regret over mistakes from its country\u2019s past than Germany. If you go to the Reichstag, for example, your approach on foot takes you on a path surrounded by Holocaust memorials, to all the Jews of Europe, but even smaller ones to the other \u201cundesirables\u201d murdered by the Nazis, even those such as the mentally handicapped, political dissidents, and the homosexuals, who made up a tiny fraction (but no less important!) of those murdered. Whether you are a tourist or a politician or an ordinary German, it is impossible to make that trek without somber reflection on mistakes from the past. Within the Reichstag itself, the graffiti left by the victorious Russian soldiers is still on the walls. What a reminder!! Every visitor, and every politician, sees the scrawls on the walls every day, of which the most printable might be \u201cDeutchland kaput\u201d. This is something that Germans have done themselves, and to themselves. It was not forced upon them by their conquerors; they could have sited the more recent holocaust memorials differently (The impossible to ignore Holocaust Memorial by the architect, Peter Eisenmann, was completed in 2005), or they could have painted over the graffiti in the Reichstag when it was renovated after the reunification, but they chose not to do so. Let me repeat that: They. Chose. Not. To. Throughout Germany, you can find reminders of the hubris and brutality of the Nazi regime, and the culpability that ordinary Germans had in that horror. It is on permanent display for everyone to see, day in and day out. Although there are literally hundreds of memorials and monuments throughout Germany that constantly remind Germans (and anyone else) of the mistakes of the past, I think the epitome of this commitment to remembrance and regret, are the Stolperstein, which are literally designed to make a passerby stumble (Stolper) over them and become aware, if only for a few seconds, of one of the millions murdered by the Nazis. Whether it is the graffiti, the bombed out shells of building left untouched as reminders, the concentration camps and the way German children have studied the Holocaust in agonizing detail, there is a commitment in German society that is best summed up by the phase \u201cRemember! Never again!\u201d That is something that deserves recognition and praise. ",

            "answer_text": "To put it simply: 1. Making a Nazi salute is a crime (6-month jail term)2. Saying \"Heil Hitler\" is a crime (6-month jail term)3. Wearing a Nazi swastika is a crime (6-month jail term)4. Denying the Holocaust is a crime (6-month jail term)5. The national anthem is not \"Deutschland uber alles.\" So don't sing it if you don't want to get into trouble. Sing only the 3rd stanza of Deutschlandlied: \"Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit.\" In the 1950s, the Nazi issue was about \"collective guilt\" since people then lived during that time. Sadly, they were brainwashed by the Nazis into believing that everything was all well in the Fatherland and were taught to despise the Jews. But average Germans never knew Jews were sent to concentration camps and gassed to death.  In the 1990s, the Nazi issue was more of a part of history that should be rejected in the same way as communism was. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Germany was reunited and German patriotism arose again albeit in a non-militaristic way. The European Union was promoted as the key to peace in Germany and Europe - that Germans are part of a wider European community.  Today, instead of instilling collective guilt, the Nazi past is treated as a history lesson. Germans are taught at the age of ten about the Nazi atrocities and every student is required to visit a concentration camp. Thanks to in-demand German exports, great football, delicious beer and popular culture, German identity has transformed from militaristic pomp (hard power) to 'lederhosen and laptop' (soft power).  If you really want to know how young Germans deal with Germany's Nazi Past, watch Fack ju G\u00f6hte and Generation War (Our Mothers, Our Fathers), two of the highest grossing films in Germany in 2013.  Germans are still rarely seen demonstrating a specific pride in their 'Germanness' outside of sports events. With the emergence of a renewed sense of \"Heimat,\" Germans are more comfortable to show pride in their regional origins as Berliners, Bavarians, Hamburgers, Prussians, Saxons or Swabians. Even the Bundeswehr's military songs today are Prussian marches. ",

            "answer_text": "Today, there are few people alive from the Nazi era. If you don't count those who were children at the time, there are barely any. So today it has become a different question than at the time when people's parents may have been Nazis.  The key to coping is to reject nationalism/patriotism. There is no \"our Nazi past\" because most people don't identify as \"we Germans\". If you think about it, it's nonsensical to make an engineer in Munich responsible for what a housewife in D\u00fcsseldorf does, to expect him to feel ashamed for her actions. He didn't have any influence on her. He didn't choose to be born in Munich, nor to be part of this abstract concept called a nation. There is no rational link between these two people, unless you're the kind of person who feels ashamed for what someone with the same last name does. If this applies to present-day Germans, it must apply all the more to crimes committed before we were born. Germans today ought not to be ashamed.  Living in this country, several German politicians have given voice to the idea that Germany above all has a mission to prevent anything similar happening ever again, in any country. Germans have spent the most time of all wondering \"How could that ever have happened?\" and much of German politics can be explained from the various answers given. Similarly, individual Germans may or may not feel the need to speak up against nationalism, racism and war, also in other countries, or to actively show they're anything but Nazis. Remembrance of the Holocaust is one of the most important things we can do today. German schools spend a lot of time at various stages teaching about the Nazi era and the Holocaust, often using shocking pictures that wouldn't otherwise be cleared to show to children.  Also, anybody saying anything that could be construed as relativizing the magnitude and singularity of the Holocaust   (e. g. by comparing it to the genocide of Native Americans or by weighing it against the fire-bombing of German cities or the atrocities committed against Germans immediately after the war) can expect a heavy social backlash - that kind of quote can end a politician's career. You can't figuratively call someone a Nazi either when you disagree with him in a debate in German. To do so would slowly make the idea of Nazis seem not so horrible. Unfortunately the same restraint doesn't exist in English-language debates and I've experienced and seen time and time again that English speakers make unrelated Nazi references in order to get the upper hand in a debate with Germans. It seems the younger people are, the more firmly they will reject such attempts. Since 2006, Germany has been finding a new confidence. Further reading: What do Germans think about Adolf Hitler? Do they all hate him? Respect him? What does it feel like to grow up with parents or grandparents who supported the Nazis?

            "answer_text": "Someone born in 1940 would now be about 72 years old.  Germans who were teenagers fighting for Hitler are now in their 80s.  My experience in Germany is that Germans are leery of nationalistic displays, e.g. flying the flag, singing the national anthem, etc.  And this attitude was directly fostered by the generation that experienced and survived the horrors of Nazi Germany (70+ yr olds) and suffered deep disillusionment. Today's younger Germans remember better the days of Ulbricht and the DDR's crazy antics than they do of their Nazi past.  As a reaction to all this past, Germany's youth are particularly freedom-loving and have a highly tuned-up sense of justice in both the legal and social senses of the word.  The youth have a very sensitive crap-detector in their brains and can spot hypocrisy from far away. Germans are far more \"green\" than Americans and look down on big polluting industries, an attitude that fosters (and forces) compliance with the most tedious recycling rules. Yes, they are still very rule-and-procedure-oriented and will not easily stray beyond national guidelines, recommendations and social structures. (That is one reason why the Germans are the best auto drivers in the world:  they have rules of behavior while driving and they follow them with very little variation.  They always signal, never pass on the right, allow others to merge in turn, and stay out of the far left lane.)  This rule and regulation orientation discourages social behavior that varies from the norm, i.e. the new norm of abhorrence of arbitrary, autocratic leaders and the dislike in an odd way of authority figures and cavalier disregard for the environment.  It is truly an odd combination of attributes that has evolved from their past:  their love for rules and procedures, yet a disdain for authority and autocracy.  Generally Germans do not like discussing either the DDR or the Nazi periods, because they do not regard them as relevant to their current national character.And it is true:  Americans are ones to talk and point their fingers.  Just look at our history of indian genocide, procrastination of abolishing slavery, and our ugly history of lynchings well into the 20th century.Read The J\u00e4ger Artist, a novel that has  insight into this topic.

            "answer_text": "**** Update- I got a little more to say: How about this- you really can't avoid not experiencing it constantly in Hamburg, because any brick building was totally bombed out. You would be amazed at how many whole swaths of the city were clearly flattened. You can see a couple of buildings on either side of the street that look old, then 500 Meters of brick buildings so that you can see clearly that the bomb load is fickle. It certainly gives perspective.    In Hamburg they have placed bronze cobblestones bearing the names of the victims and, as far as possible, their fates, in front of the houses where they lived as a memorial. In a sense, this returns their homes to their memory. It's a very noticeable and striking feature of the urban landscape. In certain neighborhoods you will see twenty or thirty of these fronting a row of grand apartment buildings. It's tremendously moving. We note that although the vast majority were Jewish, no one was really immune to deportation. Herr Gebhart's stone caught my attention because it was much longer than most. It's also in front of a building that is no longer there, just an empty space in the line of buildings where a bomb turned an apartment building into a park (and there are many, many such parks). My neighborhood apparently was home to a certain criminal underworld element back in the day, and Herr Gebhardt apparently was arrested multiple times, the last in 1942. He \"voluntarily\" took a parole to the eastern front, and died in the Soviet Union in 1943.    ",

            "answer_text": "Edit: Just notice that the original question that I answered here was \u201cHow do Germans today deal with their Nazi past?\u201d I am German and let me be clear about this: I have no Nazi past. The question is meaningless. I feel sad about many things that humans do to other humans today and have done to each other since ancient times. And I am always wondering what I would do in many situations that cause people to do such things to each other. Rarely is the decision trivial, if you are starving, being suppressed, treated unfairly in any way, etc. etc. And in general, (1) there are no \"Germans\" the same as there are no \"Americans\" or \"Russians\". These concepts only exist in the minds of those that have never left their home country or want to create walls between people for their own agenda. (2) Singling out groups of people may well be at the heart of much evil. Once you stop doing this, you know that you are not, for instance, going to war against \"Germans\", \"Japanese\", \"Indians\", or else, but against some not so nice and many really nice people. And that makes it much harder to do so. And if that's what you mean: My grandfather lost his siblings to starvation in World War 1 and suffered. He didn't have much to eat between the wars and suffered. He didn't have much to eat during World War 2 and he disliked the Nazis, said so, and went to prison for it. Right after the war, he didn't have much to eat and suffered. How do I feel about all that? I feel sad. Not the answer you expected, right? ",

            "answer_text": "I have been working with Germans since 40 years,My relationship with Germans was professional, scientific, social and political,First thing that struck me, is their oblivion of the atrocities of WWII by the first generation after war and denial of the atrocities by the old Germans.According to the Germans of war generation, the Extermination Camps and death chambers and Holocaust are Yankee and Jews propaganda. Second thing that captured me was the German cold blood on dangerous situations caused to the others,I remember that one day I arrived late to my office, I was directing 6 German engineers and 16 Iranian young technicians in a Telecom site under installation, I was the witness of a situation that I had not forgotten after 40 years, the 6 German Engineers had burned the chest of a small pour guy by a 1000 watt soldering iron, after a simple dispute on \"to whom belongs the cleaned and ready to use the hot soldering iron\", the six Germans had burned the guy!, what was shocking me was that, I saw no regret, no feeling, no sign of excuse of the six Germans, they were talking and laughing very loudly with each other. 12 years ago, in a scientific collaboration with a leading German company, the German scientist who was directing the company research center, tested the prototype that I had left them for evaluation, made a report (he was amazed by the results), then, he tried to open and see inside the module (I had protected the module by a very hard paste and I had added metal dust inside the paste to make it inviolable by Microscope Electronic) ,When he found that the module is protected, he tried the reverse engineering, but the circuit was not working this time, he did everything to make the module working, but the module didn't provide a suitable output.He called me, he was very angry, he said me that, the circuit is not working well, the output is 30 dB. down, I asked him to return the module for check-up, He said, send me the circuit diagram, I answered him that circuit diagram is not useful because the module is inside the paste, he answered, yes I know, I was surprised, I asked him, How he knows, he said, I opened the module, I said, but this is the violation of our agreement, he said, one day your secret will be copied by someone, WHY NOT ME?! Now see below, The U.N. disaster of Martin Koblerhttp://www.jewishjournal.com/opinion/article/the_u.n._disaster_of_martin_kobler I don't want to generalize, but these kind of behavior is, considering the others, sub-human, A few years ago, we have seen in the media the burning alive the small Turkish girl by the German Neo-Nazi groups without a judicial proceedings and without a popular condemnation of the act. I had the contacts with German political representatives of all the German political parties, My concern was their commercial relationships with the Mullahs of Iran and their nuclear works,The German green party is making an aggressive lobbying for Iranian regime, Anytime they travel to Iran, they are invited to see and enjoy the collective hangings of the political prisoners, When we ask the German congress men and women to condemn the atrocities of the Iranian Mullahs, they say, we don't want to put our business relationships with Iran under question, we have more than 12500 companies who are involved in great business with Iran. I don't want that the good Germans be offended, but, this is what I have seen till now, ",

            "answer_text": "Germans, for the most part, are confronted with WWII at an early age (in primary school) with the very clear message that the crimes committed by the Nazi regime were the worst in history and that it is duty of every German to never allow these crimes to be repeated. This continues throughout the entire schooling process and is reinforced by frequent media programs.  The main focus in Germany when talking about WWII is the Holocaust. The crimes of the Holocaust are always shown in the very stark terms and there is no element of justification or attempts to diminish these atrocities.  There is an absolute cultural consensus (i.e. a consensus among the elites of the political, media and education spheres) that Nazi Germany always be portrayed  as the, for lack of a better descriptor, \"bad guy\" of WWII (\"villain\" would not quite fit as the main Nazi actors, e.g. Hitler, Goebbels, G\u00f6ring, etc, are always portrayed as rather pathetic figures - certainly evil and brutal, but also deluded, somewhat dim, petty and insecure). Up until very recently, this consensus also called for the portrayal of the allies as absolute \"good guys\".  In the past decade or so, this part of the consensus has weakened with an open media discussion (sparked by a number of books on the topic) whether or not the mass bombings of German cities was justified. The Wehrmacht (German army in WWII) is, for the most part, strangely absent from discussions about WWII (appearing only as numbers) and largely exempt from moral judgement.  In very recent times there has even been very occasional media calls to acknowledge individual Wehrmacht soldiers as \"heroic\" soldiers (being completely unaffiliated with the Nazi party is however still a requirement). This is however not a popular trend. One (in my opinion very troubling) aspect of the German consensus on WWII is that the war with Russia is largely glossed over. The incredible atrocities committed by the German army against the Slavic people are largely ignored.The change of recent years has even led to some media figures condemning the Red Army for mass rapes during the fall of Germany (On the other hand, I have never heard anyone mention the most certainly vastly larger amount of rapes committed by the Wehrmacht). All of this tends to be true for both non-scientific history books and popular media and this consensus informs how many Germans feel about WWII. However, there is a significant group of Germans (especially older Germans) who have a much more positive view of the Nazi regime and its goals during WWII. These Germans usually are happy to condemn Hitler, the Holocaust and the war against the Allies, but think fondly of the technological, cultural and military \"strength\"  Nazi rule brought to Germany. They see it as unfortunate that Germany was unable to conquer Russia.  These views however are almost never voiced in anything but the most private of settings [but I personally have heard such ideas expressed on multiple occasions]. It is important to note that the consensus of condemnation is backed up by legal repercussions. Any display of Nazi symbols, denial of Nazi crimes or propagation of Nazi ideas can be (and usually is) persecuted. Severe cases can result imprisonment. ",

            "answer_text": "I am British. I am aware that my nation has itself committed atrocities against innocent people in the past. Yes I feel at times ashamed of my country's past and do carry some guilt. I am also proud of the good things we did. However if you research the history of German aggression and militant violence since 1870 you realise it is on a scale beyond what any other European country comes even close to committing in terms of cruelty and depravity. The Germans were responsible for starting both the 1st and 2nd World Wars. It was their Prussian militant mindset which caused these wars. In reference to the 2nd WW there have been attempts to explain away Nazi aggression by suggesting the Vetsailles Treaty was unfair. It wasn't. Hitler supported by the majority of the German people sought world domination and treated Jews in particular but also Polish and Russian non-combattants in the most deplorable way. Millions were slaughtered by the Wheimacht and the Waffen SS. The majority of Germans applauded Hitler until defeat was on the horizon. The minority of Germans who protested were quickly murdered and again the majority of Germans shed few tears. After the war the German people who had supported Hitler shed few tears over their leader's death and even fewer tears for the millions who had been murdered in their name. Self pity and a pretence of ignorance of these atrocities was the game they played. And today we see the rise of the right wing fascists in Germany again. They complain that they have been blamed unfairly, that it wasn't their fault, that their soldiers were heroes. History is repeating itself. We left the EU because we could see where this German dominated dictatorship was heading. Other European countries should wake up. ",

            "answer_text": "Dear friends , I am a Pakistani and having to deal with these kind of tendencies in our society. Much painful as it was going through these comments, what we must take into account is that it is neither being German nor Jewish nor anything else that allowed such atrocities to take place but the weakness is inside the human being. Unbelievable as it may sound, because we appear so different, speaking different languages, and some are white, but we are the same, the same people and share the same strength and weakness. How strange !Under similar circumstances , we tend to behave similarly. We should recognize that nursing victimhood can also be the first step towards steeling yourself to committing similar atrocities on others. One has to get on with life individually as well as collectively. Humans, like other organisms, have the capability to heal themselves . Even victims of rape do not choose to let that horrible atrocity to define and determine the rest of their lives.I was most impressed by the comment of an Italian contributor here. It is best to laugh at the perpetrator of atrocities. Nothing helps you like a robust sense of humour . May be the climate of Italy makes people less somber and they deal with past fascism better. ",

            "answer_text": "There is one aspect that I did not see discussed a lot in other answers. Germans may feel, more so than others perhaps, the need to learn the lessons of history. A few years ago, I had an interesting encounter that would have probably gone differently if I was of a different nationality: While an exchange student in America, I was standing with a German friend at a bus stop in Milwaukee, WI, discussing, in our mother language, a topic that we disagreed on. An old woman came walking up to us and let us know, in pretty good German, that her entire family had been killed in German concentration camps, that she blames all Germans, and that we should be ashamed. She particularly emphasized that nobody could claim they did not know what was happening. Her pain was authentic, even though she clearly had given this speech many times over during the last 60 or so years. We responded something along the lines that such terrible atrocities must never happen again, and that the new generation will learn from history and will be vigilant. She wasn\u2019t interested and walked away. My friend and I stood silent, probably each assuring ourselves that we were unjustly accused and that we personally would never have ignored the evil goings-on during the Nazi-era. Future generations would certainly not condemn us like that! Then we tried to get back to our initial discussion topic. It was Climate Change. ",

(i.e. look at the treatment Native Americans have as members of US society. While not facing jail for being Native Americans, they are condemned in a far worse life than the average person in US. They got less opportunities, less access to healthcare, education, etc. etc. They are treated like illegal immigrants in their own land, and that is considered normal.) I think Hittler did all other racist and genocidal nations a huge service. He focused all the attention on him and Germany. At the same time this whole era has passed in pop culture, and the media, continues to maintain this focus with vigilance. Generations over generations are reminded how horrible the Nazis were. Which is true. But it also provides a convenient diversion. I would feel sick and tired to be reminded with every opportunity, of the horrible things my ancestors did, while at the same time, there is not enough praise for all the advances in science, the arts, and countless other aspects of life Germany has offered to the world while hardcore racism is being actively practiced around the world.

And any survivor from that time is very old and is out of the actual social live. Younger Germans dont see the Nazi \u201cReich\u201d as the same country as the one they are living in. They just dont feel any conection. Young Germans also have little contact with older people, not even with their own family members. They re not very family concerned. All that is history. The real Nazis, old stile are very very few. The so called \u201cNeo Nazis\u201d (New nazi) yes, exist, but they re small in numbers and have a different position. Most of them are more Anti Muslim than anti Jew. Most of them are not even against all foreigners, but mostly specific against certain foreigners. What they do represent is a general German attitute. A German still lives mostly with the idea back in his head, that being an autentic German means being somehow superior. they rarely say it, but they live acording to it. Somehow they feel its kind of surrealistic. But they make use of it, when it comes to certain demands. Whats important. They rarely even mention that with foreigners, mostly between each others. They still believe, that a German worker is the best, that a German hotel is the best, that German rules and customs are the best. Still: The most \u201cagressive\u201d statement might be: Of course, one can not expect German standart from XXXX (whatever) Even They do have often harsh critics on German institutions. But they are still superior to all others, means those being NOT German, are even worse. ",

Compare the way the shoah is treated in Germany with, e.g.   How the Armenian genocide is dealt with in Turkey (it's a crime to mention it)How the Japanese deal with their atrocities in WW II (a lot of denial, even some glorification)How the Americans deal with the genocide of the people who were here first (it gets some mention in school, but not much. Andrew Jackson, probably the worst president with regard to the Indians, is on the $20 bill; Thanksgiving is a holiday etc.are three that spring to mind. I don't know much about how, e.g. the Cambodians deal with Pol Pot, the Russians with Stalin and so on and on and dreadfully on. Of course, some things make the shoah unique:   The Germans did it while trying to conquer the worldThey lostThey wrote a lot of it down.but genocide is all too common in history; dealing with genocide is not.

All of MY grandparent's entire families - aunts, uncles, grandparents and beyond - were Polish Jews.  There was no trace of any of them after the war.  But we understand that WE bear no responsibility for the actions of our relatives. My husband's parents are sweet, wonderful, loving people.  They also have no responsibility for what their relatives did.  And my husband's Oma (grandmother) who was a young bride when her husband was at war, only knew that her husband was fighting for his country. Just as our brave American soldiers fight for their country.  Is it right?  That is questionable. But their bravery and idealism can't be questioned. He believed he was fighting for HIS family. How can we fault that? To me, only the Nazis should be held accountable.  Only those who participated in the evil, horrible murder of innocents (who was not forced into that situation) are responsible. Not their children, or their grandchildren. As we now know the Germans were lied to and the atrocities were covered up by the state-run media. And, in my opinion, as they learned about what had happened, they were as horrified as the rest of us. ",

The answer you will get to this question, as reflected by Judith, varies on the age of the person you are asking.  Most of my younger friends have no connection from their modern day German life to that of the Nazi's.  I have also come across Germans from an older generation whose relatives tried hard to escape their military duty by fleeing the country, only to be drafted in the final throws of the war when the Germans were desperate for soldiers. Some of the Tr\u00fcmmerfrau they left behind were branded Nazi's, lost their homes, and had to rebuild a life from scratch with no husband, money, nothing.  There are no winners in war, which is the underlying critical message to teach all children, not just Germans. One way Germans have helped younger generations to 'deal' with their past is by leaving behind some of the Nazi destruction you can find scattered across the country. ",

            "answer_text": "As some one who has a deep interest in the events surrounding the second world war, I have always tried to gather material available in books or online which tries to answer this question. What I have found is definitely encouraging and the information available speaks volumes of the effort being taken by Germans to deal with Germany's Nazi past. The necessary and very symbolic gestures by the country's leaders and lawmakers on issues such as Holocaust remembrance are some of the fine examples of the national effort towards this end. I also find encouraging the dialogues and conversations being organised between young Germans and Holocaust survivors. I am sure there is a lot more going on that is positive of which I am yet to discover. Therefore by and large I would say that the Germans are going about the right way in dealing with Germany's Nazi past. ",

You can imagine how much that actually influences young children and we pretty much talk about nothing in history class until graduation. We are taught to never let thus happen ever again and that we should treat everybody equally no matter where they come from etc. And its working pretty well. In my opinion there is much less racism and or homophobia in Germany than nowadays in America. Just saying. A result from being taught to give zero shit about someone's ethnicity or religious beliefs. ",

The 5% rule means that no party gets into parliament with less than 5%. The votes for those parties are essentially ignored. Power of the Reichskanzler: There were some flaws within the Weimar Constitution that gave the \"Reichskanzler\" too much power ... but I don't remember what exactly ... I think he could force new elections ... but I could not find it.

It's strangely reminiscent of the guilt avoidance used by Hitler to justify his quest for revenge caused the the versailles treaty. Although the nazis had their international collaborators and not be held wholly responsible, the lack of trust and faith that still runs deep when Europeans especially think of Germany is not something that can overlooked. Germans, I'm afraid will not be able to wash their hands of this guilt as easily as they think they can. ",

I spent 3 days wandering Berlin, and 4.5 hours in the German History Museum-excellent collection and highly recommended.I worked my way through the museum in proper chronological sequence. I reached WW II after several hours. The displays were fantastic and very detailed.The oddity was the coverage of D-day. It amounted to half a sentence: \"the allies gained a foothold on the continent and pushed inland\"WowIn America we look at D-day as the penultimate event of the European theater. How many books and movies center on D-day? This shows a distinct difference in the viewpoints of Germans v Americans in the events of the war. ",

In 1966 while driving down the autobahn there were ruins visible.  In Kaiserslautern, while driving down Kaiserstrasse ((1980s) I saw a very tall German in full NAZI uniform pacing up and back on the sidewalk.  I was so astonished at this sight that I stopped my car, got out, and asked him what and why was he doing what he was doing.  In perfect English he said (paraphrasing) \"So we won't forget what happened.\" ",

            "answer_text": "When I lived in Germany, I always found it odd that Germans always used the term Nationale Sozialistische, abbreviated to Nazis in English, to describe the people and times of those activities. While outside Germany, we would mostly use the term German. Germans I guess use this to distance themselves from those activities, as if it had nothing to do with them, which of course is absurd, it has very much to do with all Germans, then and since then. There is no denying a lot of education on this has been done, but it nevertheless, in my view seems to remove the current generations from the context in which something like this can happen, by putting it in the context of a third party, and not the first party. That is called denial. ",

At the moment you can see that more and more people in germany demonstrate (for example PEGIDA) (patriotic europeans against islamization of western world) because they are afraid othat too many refugees are coming to germany and that among them devotees of Islamic State. That's why right-wing parties like NPD (national socialist party of germany) and AfD (Alternative for germany) get stronger more and more and get more voter. They all say they aren't nazis but the situation is almost similar like in those days. This condition scares me. ",
