            "answer_text": "In international politics or business, unfair and fairness would be more defined by whether you stuck to deals and conventional norms of the time. Self interest by very nature could offend a fair minded individual\u2019s sense of justice. but this was business. If you go by standards of International diplomacy for the time, it was far from extremely unfair or harsh. The losers did face severe penalties but one has to take into account how diplomacy and peace settlements operated for the time. The European practice of the time was winner takes it all and profits handsomely. That\u2019s how it was. Wilson did his part in watering down the terms a bit. It could have been harsher if the Europeans had their full say and followed the usual standards . The treaties are meant to reward the winners and penalize the losers. There should be no illusion on this count. Considering that the German empire had grand hegemonic aims , indulged in a high level of misconduct,imposed severe terms on others, one has to question what the outcry is all about. A cry about injustice makes sense only if the punished party has a track record much cleaner with regards to war aims and peace terms. Prussia itself imposed severe terms on Denmark,France and the German empire on The Russian empire and Romania. Not only that ,after signing of the treaty in Brest, they moved further into Russia proper and got even more concessions in August! This is apart from the deadly damage and robbery of the areas of France and Belgium under their occupation. With their own track record and the way the German armed forces behaved , their complaints are precious For example if one considers loss of territories(13%), its similar to other treaties. Also Germany didn\u2019t have to pay an indemnity as usual. More like reparations This was a innovative concept to peace settlements at the time. Before this time, governments generally used to leave civilians on their own regarding damage to their property or body. But with evolution of war and society, governments decided to take care of civilians as well. The German empire did face penalties and significant losses no doubt. but their potential to re emerge was largely intact(barring military) and the restrictions can be easily re negotiated at a later time. It was mild in term of stifling long term German recovery. There is no evidence undue advantage was taken by the victors. Short term advantages and severe penalties yes. but not unduly harsh overall by the standards of the time and infact some terms were milder than usual. The german government propaganda concerning ww1 peace and the treaty was a pack of half truths and lies . They showed no ability to come to face with the fact their behaviour has been highly deplorable and the settlements they had imposed recently and in the previous decades, are far from shining examples of generosity. Just because the German governments of the time and others in Germany cried wolf, does not mean it was true. The lies and myths they promoted and their own highly greedy peace terms makes any complaint ludicrous. Nothing prevented future German governments from renegotiating terms and ending restrictions as time proved. I have to add that info regarding war guilt clause article 231 and reparations in the answers posted, are generally faulty or display half baked understanding ",

            "answer_text": "You bet it was! Hell, it - partially - paved the way for Germany falling to the Nazis (that treaty was good propaganda-material, especially since it kicked a country that was on the verge of breaking (like kicking a person that you first clobbered over the head with a baseball-bat!)) Firstly (note: I am not going to quote numbers because they are IMHO not that important for the answer!): It stripped Germany of a lot territory that had a majority German population so nobody can claim that they were freeing the oppressed, they just took what they wanted! Secondly turned Germany into a local \u201cpower\u201d (note: It was a power in name only, but that\u2019s my next point, so let me continue, ok?) by taking away its already few colonies (while the British and French kept their colonies of course, despite the fact that many of them wanted freedom - which was as far as I know not the case with German colonies who mostly liked their overlords and had fond memories of them later on!) Thirdly it made Germany a potential victim by \u201cbreaking\u201d its armed forces (seriously, those armed forces Germany was allowed to retain were a better police force! Hell, in a lot of cases the actual police was better armed because the German Reichswehr was not allowed submachineguns (the police was!)\u2026not to mention that actual machineguns (an developing new ones!) was forbidden (they were allowed to retain a few - not all that many over all compared the arsenal built up during the war! All others, just like tanks etc. had to be scrapped! Ships were supposed to be surrendered to the Entente - but the crews scuttled them instead!), just like most other important military developments and equipment (or so severely restricted that Germany might as well not have had any equipment at all!)) and shrinking them down in number so that the country could never have been defended from any serious attack! Then there\u2019s the fact that Germany was now surrounded by Entente and Entente-Allies (like Tchechoslovakia and Poland on one side and France, Belgium etc. on the other, not to mention the British who strangled Germany with a naval blockade (which they could have done at any point before Nazi-Germany re-armed itself heavily! Seriously, the Brits could have blockaded Germany in 1925, 1930 etc. at will - especially since Germany\u2019s Navy was also size and tonnage restricted, not to mention that guns and their caliber where restricted, too!)) This was not a treaty! Seriously, it was revenge, punishment and exploitation (after all the last payments for WW1-Reparations happened in 2010 (!) almost a century after WW1 started!) Not to mention an expression of FRENCH-FEAR (all the world talks about German-Angst, but in reality it was the French who were afraid! They build the Maginot-Line to defend themselves against a country they had kicked when it was down and that didn\u2019t have a realistic chance of attacking\u2026or at least Germany wouldn\u2019t have if it had adheared to that fucked up treaty, sadly for the French their overzealousness led to a fascist leader rising in Germany who used that treaty to garner support (well, that and the collapse of the world economy in the late 30\u2019s that hit Germany especially hard, they had to still pay reparations after all!)) This was handled better after WW2, the French now are staunch German allies after all! ps: No, I don\u2019t like the Nazis, but you don\u2019t kick a beaten enemy and declare them to be exclusively guilty for a World War that they didn\u2019t start (Austria-Hungary did - not Germany!)! You help them, support them and make them your best friend! That\u2019s what happened after WW2 after all (for half of Germany at least - the Soviets didn\u2019t handle this as well!) ",
