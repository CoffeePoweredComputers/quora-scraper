            "answer_text": "This question is useless, it does not apply to me, I am pure red-blooded Punjabi/India, and my ancestors for thousands of years from Punjab/Pakistan.Bengalis are pride, of India, in my growing up I never heard even one word against Bengalis in our household, in my neighborhood, in my grad studies in the national institute in India.I will remain thankful to a lot of Bengali teachers/professors/lab supervisors for teaching me the art/science and finesse of Chemistry. In India, intelligence, culture, poetry, novel writing, deep thinking, complex problems, breathtaking beauty, drama, story writing, music, direction, and moving making starts and finishes with the Bengalis. No, zero substitutes for Bengalis in my books.Disclaimer: Not all Punjabi are Sikhs, the split in Indian Punjab could be 40 to 45 Hindu, and 60 to 55 Sikhs. Pakistani Punjabi could be 99 percent Muslim.Therefore not all Punjabi are Sardar jee. And only about 2 percent population of India are Sikhs.There are further subdivisions in Sikhs, Jat Sikh, Khatri Sikh, Saini Sikh, Chamar Sikh, and so on.There is a further division in Hindu Punjabi also, Brahmans, Khatri, and so on.This is also a myth that Punjabi most of them are nonvegetarian, there are huge numbers of Jains, who do not even eat onion and garlic, strict vegetarians.There are a huge number of Hindu Punjabi they are Hindu Bania\u2019s whose prowess in making money in my view is far ahead of jews,Hindu Punjabi Bania is extremely wealthy in Punjab. In general very good in education and a large number hold very high administrative jobs.Not all Punjabi drink, do drugs, swear, and dance like crazy.Not all Punjabi talk loud.Not all Punjabi drive trucks/taxis/The lifestyle they show in Bogus Bollywood is far from reality.Not all Punjabi is a bogus show-off.Not all Punjabi selling their assets to buy show off items.Not all Punjabi are seeking help for low sperm count due to the heavy use of drugs/alcohol.Not all Punjabi make a fake and bogus claim to false braveries.Not all Punjabi live off on the avails of their daddy/great daddy.Not all Punjabi make fun of their own countrymen.Not all Punjabi are ignorant of the bravery of other Indians, the Gorkha/Rajput/Maratha/Dogra/ and the South always stayed Hindu, states there were no Punjabi, they held their own. Never mind held their own please go to Cambodia and see their might in the ancient times. Angkor Wat will open anyone\u2019s eyes.Chopra brothers of Bollywood fame skimmed the systems enough by showing fake/overblown/exaggerated/Punjabi Bi jee,(mother/MIL), and all the unrealistic things in day to day life. They made a lot of money because this kind B.S. of loudness, fake bravado was very popular in the middle east and in foreign lands due a lot of NRI Punjabi.This question is baseless, I am red-blooded Hindu Punjabi, I grew up in Chandigarh. Real Punjabi does not hate anyone, especially their countrymen/women.Real Punjabi is a warrior to protect weak helpless and respect every female in the worldAuthentic Punjabi hates caste system All are children of GodReal Punjabi is a servant of God without any hate for anyoneReal Punjab is humble, and he/she is here to serve humanityAuthentic Punjabi guarded the nation for thousands of years that is he/she got an inheritance.Real Punjabi mother tells her son you are born to produce bread, and you are born to guard a borderB and BIn high-class Punjab home that is how kids are weaned on high characters and not on the filth of violence alcohol drugs vulgar and dirty music/songs. Real Punjabi believes as follows\u201cEk Noor se sab jag upjiya\u201d\u2026.We are all children of the same father. In our Arora clan, they gave the oldest son voluntarily to serve the army of Guru Jee the 10 the master.That is why we have Sikh and Hindu last name same, FYI it was the Punjabi Hindus who helped and made more followers of Sikhism. All ten Guru Jee Sahib were Hindus.Of course, we have a small number of drug addicts, school dropouts, weaned on alcohol misguided by fake and coward religious leaders and political leaders. Who destroyed the glory of Punjab.Chandigarh in my time from mid 50 s too early 70 s, (I left )was Mecca for every Indian from almost all the regions of India.It was one of the very best cities constructed from pure raw land, the new capital of Punjab. There were civil servants from Federal and Provincial Governments. Mid to very high-level military personnel, and it was one of the most sophisticated cities of those years. Of course, there were a fair number of Bengali families in Chandigarh, they were equally respected and presented a very high impression on us.It was educational Mecca, the legendary PGI, attracted very highly accomplished doctors from all corners of India. Bengali doctors were in good numbers, and I know the head of the Pathology department was world-famous Bengali doctor equally achieved his wife was very high up there also.They are very peaceful, most of them have a hobby, most of them know music, and most of them are extremely cultured. Well, who can compete with their sweets and food and very beautiful super long hair ladies who are extremely well mannered, educated, and talented? Excellent mothers/sisters/daughters/polite/high character ladies.There were a few Bengali- Punjabi marriages, Where and what is hate? Do you see it? I do not. I went to grad school in National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, U of Punjab, my professor was Bengali, a total genius, world-famous scientist. There was another professor of equal prowess, they both taught me the very best, and in reality, they both have built my life and career. Thanks to those professors, they had a significant impact on the institute and especially on my life.Dr. N.C.Ganguly and Dr. N.K.Roy, from Dairy Chemistry in the early 70 s, legends of the time. Extremely high scholars/teachers/friends/guides and influenced the rest of my life. Dr. N.C. Ganguly Chemist of Par Excellence, Administrator, friend, guide, and role model. And so was Professor N.K. Roy./Well, no one can compete with Bengali intellect, hard work, a very well balanced home, and work-life.My professor invited me to his house several times he put the basis of well-balanced life in me. I am still trying after 4 7 years, close but not exact.When I started my working career, believe it or not, our GM, in a considerable plant was a Bengali gentleman, and most of the support white-collar staff was Bengali, right in the heartland of Haryana. Strange but true, and that was in the early 70 s, he invited technical staff to his house. I had a couple of technicians from Bengal, unbelievably bright and polite and mind their own business. Right in the remote area of Haryana, we used to have Bengali authentic sweets and food. His wife learned good functional Punjabi and learned to swear words without an accent very fast. Lovely family and left a permanent mark, and it had been close to five decades.My red-blooded Hindu Punjabi mother, always forced us to eat fish, saying Bengali are smart because they eat fish. And you guys should eat fish, maybe, just maybe. Your marbles will also shine too.PS: In my lifetime I have not seen even one Bengali person who is NOT super smart. I being a Punjabi, will ever remain thankful to Bengali influence in shaping my future.Do you see any hate? This question is very wrong,I believe there is the specified percentage of illiterate Punjabi, on drugs, alcohol, violence, wife beater, family violence, killing and getting killed that is the only thing they know. These goons hate everyone including Punjabi. The rest of the Punjabi is very peaceful, God-fearing, and believes in mutual love and cooperation for everyone. It is the other smaller percentage which caused the raucous and bad name to the whole community, most of them are school dropouts, living on the avails of their parents, and fake bravado. An educated Punjabi will be out of mind to hate Bengali intellectuals like Rabindranath Tagore, and Amritiya Sen  https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&ccid=KnytWXY8&id=EB499F7C855593770E80667470F00D8CD57321D9&thid=OIP.KnytWXY8hjQMFnmJ9tZDngHaEZ&mediaurl=https%3a%2f%2fs-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2f736x%2f17%2f8f%2f24%2f178f24e6cebc4be9cbbefd00f2537103.jpg&exph=415&expw=700&q=Poems+Rabindranath+Tagore&simid=608018022745442016&selectedIndex=12&ajaxhist=0  Amartya Sen - Wikipedia Only illiterate druggy, alcoholic, wrongly educated by religious fanatics a small percentage are born as losers and die as losers. They spread hate even within their community never mind hating the rest of Indian society.They are living on the avails of their father/grandfather and eventually will die of drug overdoses. Or low sperm count or gang wars or paralyzed for life or end up in jail or die of STDTo our Bengali brothers/sisters/; Rest assured most of the educated Punjabi respect you as a beautiful community. I do, and remain indebted to my professors. As they say, a few drops of dirty water does not make the ocean dirty; these dirty drops are everywhere in every community. A real Punjabi respects Gurus who laid down their lives for us, it does not matter we are Hindu or whatever.    As said earlier: There is a small percentage of Punjabi who is doing a great job in self-destroying themselves. Their low level of talk, no or low formal education no manners, life riddled with alcohol, drugs, overweight, diabetes, heart attacks, STD, get rich quick schemes, the problem with the law, family violence, and wife-beating soon are going to catch up on with them.Due to drug overdose being in comatose situation daughter carried the body of the father for cremation. Welcome to Punjab and Punjabi culture.Do not feel offended they insult everyone; they do not have any respect for themselves, some of them put the ashes of their fathers in dirty ponds rather than putting in a sacred river.T his small percentage of losers should affect your final judgment of Real Punjabi, there is still a lot.In sweet memory of Rabindranath Tagore.In grade 10, I read the story: The Home Coming, It left a permanent mark on me, In sweet memory of Rabindranath Tagore.  Enjoy it is really funny: A fight between a Bengali and Punjabi.  Enjoy all the flowers from a beautiful garden.  ",

            "answer_text": "I think this like this:Why do Muslim Punjabis hate Muslim Bengalis?\u201d This rivalry is not seen in between Non Muslim(Punajabis&Bengalis) much. Well except some. There is a joke which I heard in a Bengali parody cassete about twenty or more years ago. It goes like this: Both a Well built Punjabi man and a weak average Bengali man are tarvelling on a train in pre partition times. Goes like this: Bengali Man(BM) is trying to open the window but cannot since its very tightly shut. The Punjabi Man(PM) sees the sitatutaion and comes and with one hand lifts the window. He then pats the BM on the shoulder and says:\u201dRoti Khao Roti Khao\u201dmeaning :Eat bread,Eat bread\u201d. Punjabis usually eat Rotis\u201d or hand made breads for most meals. Bengalis usually eat rice.The BM felt very bad instead of thanking began to think. Then he(BM) started after say half an hour pull the Emergency chain.(This chain if pulled uncessarily pulled without justifiable cause will end up with puller paying a heavy fine.If not being able to pay,puller will have to go to jail.) The PM thought he(BM) still did not have strength to pull the chain.He went and pulled the chain.The train stopped and the train police was taking the PM to jail. The BM then patted the PM on shoulders and said:\u201dBhat Khao Bhat Khao\u201d This meaning \u201cEat Rice,Eat Rice\u201d,implying the PM should eat rice to get intelligence. The Punjabis have a reason as they think like the Arabs. Pls read my answer and just replace Punjabis with arabs and Bengalis with Pakistanis. They think about Bengalis : Bengalis are inferior even though they are Muslims( I guess it does not apply to Hindu Benaglis)They don\u2019t look goodThey are not meant to rule.(even though they think about rest of Pakistan same way.)Mr.Hassan Nissar honestly explains:  Imran Khan on :  It is more of political rivalry.The feeling of superiority over another race.
