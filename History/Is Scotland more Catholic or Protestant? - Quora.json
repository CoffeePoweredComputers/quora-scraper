            "answer_text": "Scotland was Christianised by Irish monks beginning in the 6th century. England had been Christianised by the Romans. About 100 years later, when the Kingdom of Northumberland began to encroach on southern Scotland, there was a clash between the Irish form of Christianity and Roman Catholicism, which resulted in the Synod of Whitby in 644. The Roman version gained ascendancy. Scotland remained Roman Catholic until the Reformation in the 16th century when John Knox introduced Protestantism, tending towards Calvinism. There were religious wars (partly internal, partly with England) off and on right through to the end of the 17th century, after which the Church of Scotland and Presbyterianism became dominant, Episcopalianism being a minority. There are only a few pockets of Old Catholic communities (pre-Reformation) left in Scotland, notably the island of Barra. However, from the early 19th century on there was a huge influx of migrants from Ireland, who brought their Catholic religion with them. Since then, successive waves of Italian and Polish immigrants over the 20th century and specifically Polish immigrants since 2004 have increased the number of Catholics in Scotland. Scotland certainly has had a mainly Protestant tradition for over 400 years, and in the 2011 Census in Scotland the Church of Scotland (Presbyterian) was listed as the main religious denomination, with Roman Catholic in second place. There are, however, sizeable minorities of Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, Hindus and Jews.[1] [2] Today, about 50% (and rising) of Scots say they have \u201cno religion\u201d. Protestant church attendance is falling rapidly, while Catholic attendance has been rising due to immigrants from the EU, so that the numbers of practising Protestants and Catholics will probably even out.[3] [4] Footnotes[1] https://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/documents/censusresults/release2a/rel2A_Religion_detailed_Scotland.pdf[2] Census 2011 equality results: analysis, part two[3] Catholicism '\u02dcset to become' most popular religion in Scotland[4] Dramatic fall in churchgoers in Scotland",

            "answer_text": "Scotland is mostly Protestant but it has a large Catholic minority. During the Reformation Calvinism became very influential in Scotland. In fact, when Scotland broke with the Catholic Church, it was Calvinism which provided the theology for its established Church. Scotland still has an established church and that church is separate from the established church in England, which is known as the Church of England. Members of the Church of Scotland are similar to Presbyterians but members of the Church of England are Anglicans (known as Episcopalians in the United States). While the Church of England has always tried to strike a balance between \u201cHigh Church\u201d members who favour ritual and a theology which is similar to Catholicism and \u201cLow Church\u201d members who favour a complete break with anything which is suggestive of Catholicism, the Church of Scotland has favoured a more stridently Calvinist attitude. This has been the source of a great deal of tension since there has always been a substantial minority within Scotland which has remained Catholic. There is an ethnic dimension to this. In general, Calvinism was embraced by the English-speaking communities of the Scottish Lowlands while Catholicism remained strong in the Gaelic-speaking communities of the Highlands. The are are, of course, staunchly Protestant Gaelic-speaking communities and people in the Lowlands who are Catholic. Before the Reformation Scotland was already divided along linguistic and cultural lines with the Lowlands speaking a form of English similar to that of the northeast of England (this form of English, as it is spoken in Scotland is often regarded as a language in its own right because it was the language of the Scottish court and the administration of justice) and the Highlands speaking Gaelic, a language which had spread from the northeast of Ireland to the southwest of Scotland and then up into the Highlands. The Highlanders felt increasingly marginalised and this feeling was increased when the Lowlands embraced Calvinism. Even now there is intense sectarianism in Scotland because of generations of hostility between the adherents of the two forms of Christianity. People from outside Scotland think of the Scottish Highlanders as the typical Scots but the Lowlanders regarded them as being as being Irish. For the Lowland Scots, to be Scots was to be a Lowlander and Protestant. This was a view which was deeply resented by the Highlanders for whom the origins of Scotland as a separate kingdom could be traced back to the Dalriada, a kingdom which had been made up of two parts, one on the northeast coast of Ireland and the other in the southwest of what would become Scotland. In fact, the modern English name for the country, Scotland, was coined in the medieval period by taking the Latin word for an Irishman and tacking the word \u201cland\u201d on to it. The accusation that the Highlanders are really foreigners from Ireland is rather peculiar given that the literal meaning of the name \u201cScotland\u201d is \u201cLand of the Irish.\u201d ",
