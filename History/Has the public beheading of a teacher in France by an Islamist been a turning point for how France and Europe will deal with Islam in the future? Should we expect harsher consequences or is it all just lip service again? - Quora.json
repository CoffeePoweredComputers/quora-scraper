            "answer_text": "When it comes to religious extremism of any kind, it is difficult to deal with the issue by force, whether it be by killing extremists, deporting them, or imposing economic sanctions on a country that is believed to be the source of that extremism. Did the police have a choice when they killed the extremist who had beheaded an elderly woman and killed two others? Did the police have a choice when they killed the extremist who had beheaded the middle-school teacher Samuel Paty? No, not at all. They were faced with an immediate threat and so, they had to react accordingly for their safety, and the safety of those around them. Is this anything new to France? No, not really. Following the recent attack in Nice, many are now remembering the 2016 Nice truck attack, where 86 died and hundreds more injured. The attacks have become a turning point for many people in France. Ever since the attacks, many people started defending French secularism and freedom of speech, while many Muslims in France are growing defensive of their religion. In fact, some Muslims are refusing to condemn the killing of Samuel Paty because they believe that anyone who fails to show respect to their prophet deserves to die. Extremists like these are what are undermining secularism. It is a clash of ideologies; on one hand we have secularism, and on the other we have extremism. Yes, you can kill extremists, but that does not kill extremism. You can deport extremists, but that does not remove extremism. You can impose sanctions on extremists, but that only stirs more discontent and resentment towards the country imposing sanctions, and could convince more people to embrace extremism. The change must come from within. The various leaders, preachers, clerics, etc. who are promoting radicalism, need to stop promoting and encouraging it. On the other hand, France and other Western countries need to stop giving this radicalism a name. Calling it Islamic radicalism gives radical Muslims an excuse to be radical: \u201cLook at these countries in the West! Calling us terrorists and mocking our religion!\u201d But, if they don\u2019t have an excuse to be radical, their ignorance will be exposed. Giving a name to radicalism only deepens the divide, a divide that is inherently damaging to secular societies. I am sure there are many moderate Muslims in the West who are against these extremist attacks and want nothing to do with it. But they will feel less obliged to combat the extremism that is occurring within their Islamic circles and communities, if they do not even feel welcomed by secular states. ",

            "answer_text": "If you read my other answers to some related questions (like this one), I condemned the murdering of the teacher. I\u2019m from Iran. You can\u2019t find any terrorist attack involving an Iranian. I guess the Islamic terrorists with French or American nationality (including the white ones) are even more than Iranians. If we ignore the non-religious people, Iranians are among the most moderate Muslims in the world. Some Israelis may accuse the Iranian government for terrorist attacks, however they aren\u2019t proved and still not related to Islamic extremism. Israel itself publicly confessed that it has terrorized some Iranians including some top Iranian scientists. Anyways, that is a struggle between the Iranian government and Israel. The Shia branch of Islam is again a moderate sect. You can again investigate the terrorists attacks by Islamist extremists and count how many of them were Shia? If not zero, less than a handful. The majority of terrorists were Sunni and particularly Wahhabi or Salafi. Who funds these sects? Saudi Arabia and some other Arab state of the Persian Gulf. But which country is under sanction and pressure by these European countries? With which country are France or other Western countries allied? About which country do you hear more propaganda in News, or by the presidents of this or that country? As I said I want to sympathy with French people and I do, but when they themselves sell their people to barrels of oil and make pressure on countries which resist against their greed, then what can I say? I don\u2019t want here to say that France host a recognized terrorist group ( and not opposition), MEK, which have killed many Iranians. To answer the question, there have been many other similar cases, but these Western countries haven't changed their policies, when they could. And I doubt if this case is different. So, it\u2019s not about moderate Islam or radical Islam, it\u2019s about money and politics. ",

Nonetheless, a significant part of the French population is considering their national values of laicism and freedom of speech under attack by Islam at this point. This will likely strengthen support for the Front National (National Rally - Wikipedia ), a right-wing party with xenophobic and anti-european tendencies. Will it be enough to get Marine Le Pen - Wikipedia into the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace - Wikipedia ? At this point I still doubt it, but it is definitely another drop in the bucket. If Le Pen ever is elected, France is likely to become a very unpleasant place for Muslims to live. ",
