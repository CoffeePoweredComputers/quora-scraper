But it is not! \u201cIt sounds like an easy question, right? Well, Thomas Jefferson certainly wrote it \u2014 in terms of authorship. But do you know whose hand it was that literally produced the famous handwritten copy? If you\u2019re not sure, don\u2019t worry, historians aren\u2019t completely certain either. That said, there is consensus that it was \u201cprobably\u201d Timothy Matlack, of Pennsylvania. Matlack had been appointed clerk to the secretary of the Second Continental Congress, Charles Thomson, a little over a year before the Declaration. Incidentally, he also wrote George Washington\u2019s 1775 commission.\u201c  Engraving of Timothy Matlack by Samuel Sartain, after Charles W. Peale. PR 52, Portrait File \u201cAnyway, Matlack\u2019s document is usually referred to as the \u201cengrossed\u201d copy. If you\u2019ve never heard the term, it is commonly used to describe official, often legal, documents such as deeds and commissions. More specifically, it denotes a document written in a clear, formal hand, meant to be the authoritative copy. And authoritative the engrossed Declaration is. But it\u2019s a minor detail, often overlooked, that the iconic, physical artifact itself was not itself produced on July 4, 1776.\u201d \u201cIf your history is a little rusty, the New York delegation, it so happens, abstained from the voting while awaiting their instructions. So technically, from July 4th only 12 of the 13 colonies had actually voted for the Declaration until July 9th when New York officially approved it. Only on the 19th did Congress ultimately order the engrossed copy, and nearly two weeks passed before Congress actually signed Matlack\u2019s copy on August 2nd.\u201d Attribution Who wrote the Declaration of Independence? | New-York Historical Society https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-history https://www.surfnetkids.com/independenceday/261/who-wrote-the-declaration-of-independence/ ",

            "answer_text": "Just in case you have not seen it, this is a very fine and concise answer from a similar question five years ago:  John Cowan Answered August 21, 2015 Originally Answered: Who was the main author of the Declaration of Independence? A committee of five (Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, Robert Livingston of New York, and Roger Sherman of Connecticut) were appointed by the Second Continental Congress on June 11, 1776, to write a declaration of independence, though independence had not yet been decided on. Thomas Jefferson was asked by the other committee members to draft it, and did so. The committee then asked for and got a number of changes. It was probably at this point that the standard word \"inalienable\" was replaced by \"unalienable\".The committee then forwarded the revised draft to Congress on June 28. From then through July 1, Congress edited the draft, tightening the wording and removing over 25% of it, including Jefferson's negative comments on slavery and the slave trade. Congress then set it aside, voted for independence unanimously on July 2 (which therefore is the real Independence Day), made more changes on July 3 and 4, approved it, and sent it to the printers. Though John Hancock signed it on July 4 as President of Congress, many of the other signatures were not added until August 2, and the last one not until November 4.Jefferson disclaimed any originality for the ideas in the Declaration. Some were drawn from his own preamble to the revolutionary Constitution of Virginia, others from the Virginia Declaration of Rights, still others from various European philosophers and legal writers \u2014 the Declaration is as much an indictment of King George and his American governments as a declaration of natural http://rights.So Jefferson was the main author, but many hands and minds contributed to the Declaration as adopted by Congress and as we know it today.
