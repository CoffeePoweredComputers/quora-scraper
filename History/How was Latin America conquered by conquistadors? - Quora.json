            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on the region, as each one had different experiences when it came to the conquistadors: In the West Indies, Taino & Carib groups were subdued by means of force & illness, provided the Spaniards had brought with them steel armor, cavalry & gunpowder. Indigenous numbers were not as many to pose a threat.Mesoamerica\u2019s most impotant kingdom at the time was the Triple Alliance. Hernan Cortes made alliances with the Tlaxcalans & several other Aztec enemy tribes & chiefdoms, who increased the number of his raiding party from a couple thousands to tens (probably surpassing the hundred) of thousands. This alliance & the smallpox that decimated the Aztec population provided the ground for Tenochtitlan to fall after a siege.From there, Spainards went to the West after founding the Viceroyalty of New Spain, a city over the ruins of the old Tenochtitlan. They conquered the Tarascans because the latter did not offered any resistance, but the king received the Spaniards in his palace: they betrayed him.To the East, in Central America, the Spaniards had to improve their tactics: steel armor was not suitable for the forest terrain, so some of them changed it to Mayan vests. They subdued the different chiefdoms there as well, by means of involuntary illness, steel & gunpowder.To the North, in Aridoamerica, California & New Mexico, they sent several missionary expeditions to convert the locals & explore. Stories here vary from lost raided Spaniards to attacked native villages.Nootka Territory. Here the Spanish missions only limited to create coastal fortifications.Peru\u2019s trademark, when it comes to History, are the Inca. They were subdued by the Spaniards after the latter took advantage of the ensuing civil war in the Empire (two brothers attempting to take control) & the naiveness of the Emperor, by attending completely unarmed a Spanish delegation in which he was ambushed & executed. As well, they were impacted by the smallpox.In Terra Firme (Colombia), Spaniards conquered the Muisca taking advantage of yet another rivalry. Two chiefdoms (zaque & zipa) gave the ground to the Spanish to conquer the land, though they suffered heavy casualties to nature.Lastly, the Araucans were never subdued by the Spaniards, who lost some minor expeditions & even towns to the former resistance. They were able to reject cavalry charges with the method of standing-still pikemen.In summary, I would say it was the result of illness, diplomacy, deception & weaponry. ",

            "answer_text": "Different parts of the continents were discovered, explored, claimed, & changed by force into reflecting the wishes of Spain, Portugal, France, or even Britain by becoming the more like those countries and the kind of countries they wanted it to be. Actually the same type of forced colonization that happened to most of the continent of Africa, complete with different European nations battling others for land, colonies, territory, national threats & powers. The scramble for Africa was the same as the scramble for Latinamerica. Some conquistadors were Christopher Colombus, an Italian for Spain Ferdinand Magellan or Fernando Magellan for Portugal De las Casas Cabeza de Vaca Alberquerque a Portuguese French conquistadors Hernando Cortes And Sir Francis Drkake for England.
