            "answer_text": "Define strong. Hard? Any idiot can harden a blade well beyond 65RHC. Problem? It will shatter on any hard impact. Then soft? Too soft, and the blade will not hold an edge and may stay bend. Flexible? Which sword type are we talking about? A super flexible sword intended for thrusting is as useful as a brick for a swimming aid - much of the force will be wasted on the flex and not be used to penetrate the target. Stiff? Too stiff of a blade bears the risk of breaking the blade on impact. There are a probably a dozen metrics to determine the quality of a sword blade for its intended purpose; \u201cstrongness\u201d is not one of them. ",

During a project on Damascus steel students analysed the various pattern welding techniques from history and the metallurgical properties of the various alloys and layers. I can\u2019t remember where I read the report but suspect it was Scientific American. At the end of the project the students created a \u201csuper sword\u201d. ",
