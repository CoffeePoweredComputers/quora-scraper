            "answer_text": "Chinese calligraphy brushes run the full price range, from 10 RMB (in China) to as much as you would like to pay! In the US I buy brushes for about $6.00 for my beginning students to use. The absolutely cheapest brushes available are probably not the best, but price is not an essential indicator of quality when selecting a calligraphy brush. Unfortunately, some brushes work well, but in order to produce them cheaply, they soon fall apart. It won\u2019t affect your calligraphy, but you won\u2019t own a functional brush for long. My recommendation is that you buy a brush from a reputable seller, or have someone knowledgeable help you with your selection. It is difficult to describe the qualities of a good brush, but easy to tell when you see one. As for the brush pen you refer to, there are brush markers available for a dollar or less. The quality of these is more uniform. The advantage of a brush marker is that like any other marker it already has ink, doesn\u2019t have any danger of spillage and is therefore easier to take with you and use anywhere. Bottom line: price should be no obstacle to getting started with calligraphy. Perfectly reasonable brushes are available for a very tiny investment! ",

[\u6c34\u5beb\u5e03 Shu\u01d0xi\u011bb\u00f9 / shoeishieebuh literally \u201cwater writing cloth\u201d with squares arranged in a 3x3 pattern \u4e5d\u5bae\u683c ji\u01d4g\u014dngg\u00e9/jeougongger] As soon as the water from a brush touches the cloth, it turns dark. As the water dries up, the characters fade away, so the cloth is reusable. Four Advantages: (1) There is no ink to stain your hands, your clothes etc. (2) You don\u2019t waste tons of paper that you will definitely throw away (3) You don\u2019t have to be constantly reminded that your characters don\u2019t look right. You can try again and again (4) Not using ink produces less wear and tear on brushes, so they will last longer, too. No need for rinsing! ",
