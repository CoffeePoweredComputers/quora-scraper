And also it was not Ancient Greece but Hellas. Hellas doesn't have anything with Greece. The Hellenes were with darker skin than the greeks who have slavic ancestors. It is not possible to be saying that you are descendent of the Hellenes if Hellas was destroyed in 3\u20131 century BC and Greece was found in 19 century AD. ",

            "answer_text": "No man ever ruled a united Greece. Greece was made up of countless city states with different governments and rulers. There were several periods where one city state or an external empire managed to gain dominance over the other city states, but usually none of the city states were ever assimilated into one unified empire. First, the Persian Empire managed to dominate most of Greece, until the work of a few city states, namely Athens and Sparta, managed to push them back into Asia Minor. After that, Athens built a trading empire spanning the Aegean Sea, and probably was the most dominant. But then Sparta became the most dominant city state after the Pelopponesian Wars. Later, Thebes managed to beat Sparta at Leuctra, and so it became the most powerful city state, until Macedonia under Philip and later Alexander managed to beat the other city states. Then Alexander went on a world conquest of the Achaemenid Empire, and when he died, the Greek city states broke off from Macedonia again. Until Rome came along, and annexed all of Greece. For most of its independent history, the city states of Greece did have to submit to external threats or to other city states, but no empire except for Rome managed to completely assimilate each and every city state.
