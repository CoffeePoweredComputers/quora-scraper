            "answer_text": "The most important thing about Charles Dickens is the age he was in. The Victorian Age is also called the Age of Mannerism. Do understand, this age had a huge thing about aristocratic society, which was full of hypocrisy at that time. Now you can understand that when the upper strata of a society is hypocrite and is too concerned about their lives, it gives rise to a darker, murker picture of the working class of the society. Corruption, crime was at its its highest and no one was talking about them, except for one writer , whose theme focused on the lives of the general people, and not the gentry. Charles Dickens portrays Victorian Age society, without showing sympathy to the aristocratic class. He projected how the society was a blend of the good and evil, unlike the other writers of the time. Therefore, Dickens became acclaimed as the greatest writer of the Age. ",
