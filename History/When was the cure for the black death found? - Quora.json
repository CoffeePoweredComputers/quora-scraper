            "answer_text": "There are multiple treatments for the plague. The earliest, a vaccine, was developed by Waldemar Haffkine at the end of the 19th century. Haffkine was a busy guy, who also developed a vaccine for cholera. Since then, there have been several other regimens developed for treatment of the plague. It turns out to be vulnerable to a variety of antibiotics. It needs to be caught early, but once treatments were first discovered, it turned out to be very easy to cure. ",

Nobody knows exactly what the Black Death was.The popular belief that it was the disease caused by Yersinia Pestis (and commonly called Bubonic Plague) is almost certainly false\u2026 Some have suggested, with good cause, that the medieval disease was a viral infection rather than bacterial \u2026 BUT we really do not know the cause, nor really even the nature, of the medieval plague. Anybody who says differently has never bothered to read any of the literature on the subject and, should they be prompted to respond, need not cite the French DNA analysis of medieval grave sites (which could not be replicated by subsequent studies).
