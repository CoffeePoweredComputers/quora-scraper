            "answer_text": " The oldest known/surviving photograph (which is to say, image made with a photochemical process of some kind in a camera obscura) is known as \u201cView from the Window at Le Gras\u201d, it was taken in 1826 or 1827 by Joseph Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce. He coated a pewter plate with a thin layer of natural asphalt (called bitumen of Judea or Syrian asphalt), and exposed it in a Camera obscura (basically, a box with a lens in one side). This asphalt is very slightly light sensitive, so when this image was projected on the plate the areas exposed to bright light hardened whereas the dark areas did not. It is thought that the exposure took at least a full day, probably two or more. After the exposure he was able to dissolve the still-soft areas of the image with a mixture of lavender oil and paint thinner (mineral spirits). The image above is a very contrast enhanced version of the picture, the original plate has deteriorated noticeably and picked up a few dents as well, unfortunately.  You can just barely see the image here\u2026  Here it is as currently displayed, it\u2019s on permanent display at the Harry Ransom Center at UT Austin. It took several tries for Ni\u00e9pce to be properly recognized as the creator of the first photograph - Louis Daguerre and Henry Fox Talbot were given most of the credit for the invention of photography since their photographic processes produced far higher quality images. Daguerre and Ni\u00e9pce became partners in 1829, but Ni\u00e9pce died of an apparent stroke in 1833. Daguerre kept working and developed the process known as the Daguerreotype over the next few years. Fox Talbot independently developed his process (the Calotype) in England and was producing them by 1835; both were announced to the public in 1839. Note that Fox Talbot\u2019s process was actually similar to something Ni\u00e9pce had been working on two decades prior, and that Ni\u00e9pce had been working closely with Daguerre up until his death. Though his very first images were crude in appearance, he had a hand in the two processes that people think of when they think of the invention of photography. So, that\u2019s the short version of the story, to the best of my recollection. Many other inventors were experimenting with various ideas in the 18th and early 19th centuries, you can read all about them here: History of photography - Wikipedia And finally, there is the Ni\u00e9pce House website\u2019s History of Photography. The house where he took that first photograph is now a museum, open only during the summer. (Sort of on the road from Paris to Lyon, if you\u2019re interested) ",

            "answer_text": "William Henry Fox Talbot produced the first known photograph on paper, using the negative/positive process in 1835. His book, The Pencil Nature, was the first photography book. Talbot did not publish the results of his work until after a process invented by Jacque Louis Daguerre became known in 1839. Daguerre\u2019s photographs were produced in silverized metal and were one of a kind images that could be seen as negatives or positives depending upon the way they were viewed. Often the date for the beginning of photography will be listed as 1839 because Daguerre\u2019s process was, for at least a decade, more widely known and used. ",
