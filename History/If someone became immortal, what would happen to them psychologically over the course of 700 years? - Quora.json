            "answer_text": " It would be epic. Born into a first-world country, she lives a very pleasant life. First kiss in high school, merit scholarship to go to college, shitty internships, living with too many roommates in a group house. Good friends. Bad friends. Fun dates. Bad dates. Age 25: Officially \u201cadulting.\u201d She\u2019s maxed out her Roth IRA for the first time this year. Amazing to think she\u2019s already saving for retirement. Age 27: She\u2019s in love. This is the year she gets married (average age for women to marry in the United States). Age 30: Her first child! Age 38: Her first home! Age 40: Wow, she\u2019s aging well. Age 48: Her child is off to college. The similarities in their appearances are off putting. Everyone thinks they are sisters. Age 50: What is happening? All her friends are aging. She looks and feels as good as she did when she was 25. Her partner doesn\u2019t want to do as many activities as her. Some of her friends have tragically fallen ill with cancer or heart disease. Age 55: The doctors don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Her cells are not decomposing. Her bones aren\u2019t shrinking and her muscles don\u2019t show any signs of weakening. Her cognitive tests show zero decline. Age 60: Word has gotten out about this \u201ctimeless\u201d woman. She\u2019s done some press about how she has kept in such good shape. She signs a book deal. Her child has a child. She\u2019s a grandmother. She looks identical to her daughter. Age 65: Her book, 40 Years a Twenty-Year-Old, is a New York Times bestseller. Her family has built a very comfortable nest egg of several million dollars from her lifetime of retirement savings plus her book sales. Age 70: She has taken to athletics and is setting all sorts of national and even world records for her age bracket. Her stardom rises. Age 75: Her daughter looks older than she dy. It\u2019s uncomfortable being with her partner in public because she looks 50 years younger. She\u2019s in peak shape, but her partner looks elderly. She feels distant from her spouse and her child. Her social circle is nearly non-existent. Her childhood friends are completely different from her and she\u2019s too much of a novelty to make friends with people who \u201clook and act\u201d her age. Age 80: Her partner passes away. She hasn\u2019t aged in over 50 years. She wonders if she is immortal. She\u2019s an international celebrity. Age 100: The last person she ever knew from her childhood has died. She feels a weird sense of isolation from humanity. Age 123: She breaks the world record for the oldest person to have ever lived. She realizes that everyone alive today was born after she was born. She visits her daughter, who is 93, at a nursing home (paid for with her book royalties). She spends a lot of time hiking and kayaking with her great-great-grandson. Age 150: Her celebrity has taken on a more mythical status. She is a frequent and celebrated talk-show guest and provides historians all kinds of eye-witness accounts of events over a hundred years ago. She has no real close friendships and has decided to direct her seeming immortal life toward academia. Climate Change has extremely damaged the earth and governments in many coastal countries have collapsed. Age 165: She\u2019s fluent in ten different languages. That \u201cnest egg\u201d she thought she needed to pay for her retirement and her book royalties have been gaining compounded interest for decades, and she is a millionaire many times over. Money is no object to her. The concept of a nation-state is changing as physical boundaries of the earth are rewritten with changing sea levels and the conversion of many agricultural lands to deserts. Age 180: She's fallen in love again. She starts a new family. It feels weird at first, but she is happy and loves having children again. This is a bright spot in the face of mass starvation and population loss. Age 350: She's had three families and has seen three beloved \u201clife partners\u201d die and generations of her descendants die. Life is too much to bear. Everyone she loves is gone in the blink of an eye. No one is even alive to share in their memory. She falls depressed. She attempts suicide and is horrified that she cannot die. She wonders if she lived a previous life and is now in Hell. Perhaps she is, because the world itself is hotter and more unstable. Age 400: It's taken FIFTY years of therapy and processing, but she decides to give life another try. Perhaps she could discover a way to make herself mortal. In the meantime, nations are formed much more fluidly and, with a greatly reduced global population, can be much more easily overthrown with the right conditions. Now that she has attained demi-god status and immeasurable wealth and knowledge, it only follows she would form her own nation and build a utopia for humankind. She calls it, reductively, Eden. Age 450 Her compounded investments are ridiculous and she has some of the largest venture capital investments, hedge funds, and philanthropic organizations in the world. She\u2019s gotten a PhD, a JD, an MD, and, for a brief 20-year career as a vet when she got into farming, a DVM. She\u2019s had dozens of careers. She has spent hundreds of years working on the most difficult problems of physics and mathematics. She\u2019s made discoveries that would be unachievable in a regular lifetime. She\u2019s developed a way to travel through outer space as fast as .3c. Eden is a bastion of wealth and vitality as she is able to personally fund the government and support the population with a universal basic income. Age 500: Preparation is complete. She will become the first human (if you can call her that) to leave the solar system. She is going to use her technology to go to a solar system that\u2019s 4.7 light years away\u2014-the closest to Earth\u2014where there is a possible planet in the habitable zone. She is obviously the best candidate as she can guarantee (everyone thinks) that she will live to make it there and, if she decides, back. At .3 speed, she'll reach it in only 10\u201320 years. She could be back to celebrate her palindrome birthday of 555! Age 600: She made it. She found a habitable planet. Her arrival was disastrous, however. Her massive ship failed to slow enough and collided into a vast portion of land traveling tens of thousands of miles an hour. She blanketed the planet in an atmosphere of exploded land that caused a several-years-long winter and killed 90% of the life forms there. Some of them were massive creatures that were as tall as trees. She is horrified by what she has done. She has caused an apocalypse and permanently altered life on this planet. Age 650: She feels something she hasn\u2019t felt in over 600 years \u2014 she feels\u2026.older. She considers her own mortality in a way she hasn\u2019t since that first time she went to the doctor's office and he said he couldn\u2019t diagnose her some 600-odd years ago. Age 690: Communications with Earth abruptly ended ten years ago and she hasn\u2019t received anything since. She is pretty sure that isn\u2019t a good sign. Instead of planning her return, she decides on Plan B: developing the several hundred thousand diverse embryos to build a new world here that she will stay to raise. Age 691: Her memory is fading. She has arthritis in both hands. She has had a bad cough for months. But she has almost found the perfect place to found civilization. She just made it to a large land mass with wide, fertile plains. Age 695: The camp is set up, but she realizes she is dying. There is such a poetic justice to this. She, a bridge between worlds. The last of her kind. Starting a new world while hers is ending. Her decades-long wish to be mortal and die is now seemingly coming true\u2014right when she wants to live so she can raise her \u201cchildren.\u201d Age 699: Her test batches have all gone horribly. They just can\u2019t survive. It feels almost as if the world is just not ready for people like her. Perhaps, she thinks, it\u2019s a sign\u2014yes, in her old age she\u2019s started to believe in things like signs and fate. Perhaps this place must age a little longer to be ready for humans. Age 700: This world is a beautiful place. She feels connected with the universe and feels this solar system is truly her home. She\u2019s travelled light years and left a dead world behind to found a new one. After centuries of fame, she feels content that she shall die and leave a world that will never know she existed. She takes her beautiful \u201cchildren,\u201d frozen in their state, to their time capsule where they will sleep until the conditions are right\u2014-temperatures that stay roughly between 50\u2013100 degrees in temperate zones, for the atmosphere to change to a more fitting 21% oxygen and .03% carbon dioxide, and more kinds of wildlife that could feed people (damn that she killed all those giant creatures when she got here!). She kisses them goodnight and walks to her favorite spot beneath that one tree with the funny bend halfway up. She closes her eyes and falls asleep. \u2026.64.8 million years later, the time capsule opens. #I know I diverted quite a bit from the question but this was more fun. **Update: I am blown away by your comments and shares! It\u2019s great hearing your different takes on this story, on her character flaws, plot holes, or aspects of the story that could be explored. Thank you! **Second update: You all have been amazing and I am so touched by your supportive messages and asking to turn this into a short story or novel. I\u2019m going to do just that! I believe that posting a sign-up link got this answer flagged and temporarily removed from Quora, so visit my profile or send me a message if you want to be notified when I\u2019ve turned this into a story. :) ",
