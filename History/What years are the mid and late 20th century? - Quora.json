            "answer_text": "The point of using phrases like \u201cearly 20th century\u201d or \u201cmid 20th century\u201d is to allow some ambiguity. 1900 was definitely in the early 20th century. 1999 was definitely not. 1950 was definitely mid century. The years in between partake in a little of each. 1925 is both early and mid 20th century. 1933 is more mid century than early century, but it\u2019s still a little bit early century. Language often intentionally creates and uses these sorts of ambiguous terms. The idea is that they form a shorthand that make communication easier, because the listener can figure out what was meant through shared experience, eliminating the need for excess pedantry. ",

            "answer_text": "I could be mistaken here but a quick thought returns the early 1930s recovery from the great depression as the beginning of mid-century and the OPEC oil crisis as the click over to late-century. And I don't see it as absolute but as a matter of opinion on events of significance and of the public reaction/mood. I mean the excitment of possibility around the 1969 moon landing was seriously tempered by worries of long term energy insecurity in 72-73. We moved ahead forever changed in our fossil fuel protected (military) modern world. ",
