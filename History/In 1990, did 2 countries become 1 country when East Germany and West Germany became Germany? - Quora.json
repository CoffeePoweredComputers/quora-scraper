You can see it as the country reuniting after having been divided, which is how mpst Germans see it, or you can see it as West Germany col\u0131nising East Germany, which is how some Germans see it, or you can see it as two countries uniting, which is how almost nobody sees it. Germany was mostly considered, by both East and West, as a single country divided by politics. East Germany was a separate state but was not generally considered a separate nation. ",
