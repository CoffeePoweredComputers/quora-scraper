            "answer_text": " I absolutely believe that certain elements of mid-18th century fashion will come back into style again. Though I predict that parts of 18th century fashion such as wide panniers and the use of starch to powder the hair are unlikely to return because of their impracticality in modern society.  Fashion designers are always looking at past centuries for inspiration and as of 2020 I have already observed a growing trend for wearing pastels, ribbons, big straw hats, stripes, floral patterns, and for dyeing ones hair grey that resembles the powdered hair of the 18th century. I\u2019m excited for what the future holds in fashion for both men and women!  ",
