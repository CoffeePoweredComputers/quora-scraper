            "answer_text": "They are doing this as an archaeology experiment in France. Gu\u00e9delon Castle - Wikipedia  Gu\u00e9delon is the official site, I\u2019ve had a look through and while I can\u2019t find anywhere where they list the number of people who have worked on the castle, they accept volunteers for the summer season so I think man hours would be a better gauge than numbers. So far I have not been able to fin information on how many man hours the project has consumed so far. But considering the project started in 1997 and is not expected to conclude for several more years. I think the answer will be in the millions of man and woman hours. You could short cut a lot of that by using modern tools to cut and shape the stone and machinery to move it about. But then do you have an authentic medieval castle? ",

            "answer_text": "Well it depends on how fast you need it. If we are talking about fast track I would guesstimate about 600 persons mostly stone masons, carpenters, some metal workers and a lot of helpers. Since we are going for the autentic, there is no need a large MEP crew. This is for an assumed duration of 2 to 3 years. These numbers assume modern construction technics like cranes for elevation and trucks for stone transport. ",
