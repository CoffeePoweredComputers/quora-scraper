            "answer_text": "There has been a centuries-long feeling that various races are superior to others due to heredity\u2026 Heritable intelligence, or ability to organize, or something else.We see the results in differential stages of development and organization. As a general rule, people don\u2019t buy this any longer, but Diamond put together an organized attack on the idea, putting most of it on environment. He had some special pleading, with planted axioms, which annoyed me. Better is Sowell\u2019s \u201cCultures and Conquests\u201d. I got Diamond\u2019s book before I saw the jacket blurbs, one of which said this would end racism. I figured I\u2019d just wasted my money. Science goes where the data go. To \u201cend racism\u201d as a goal in starting out means picking and choosing your evidence, not following the evidence. ",

            "answer_text": "A good guess is that he wrote it to refute the racist assumption that peoples of the pre-Columbian Americas were inferior to peoples of Europe and Asia because the latter\u2019s societies were more advanced. Diamond points out that geography, not a lack of intelligence among the American peoples, is the reason, because it was geography that determined where certain crops grew and where certain animals existed. It was those foods and animals which helped civilizations develop and advance. ",
