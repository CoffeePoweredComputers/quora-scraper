            "answer_text": "Hundreds of classes, from tiny (El Toro) to huge (J boats) race worldwide and some have tens of thousands of registered boats\u2014Hobie Cats, Lasers . . . an endless list. Sailing and sailboat racing is a true worldwide sport. These classes may be Olympic (Finn, 470) or merely popular (5o5\u2014my very favourite dinghy class\u2014see first example below). Worldwide racing includes events that race literally around the world, such as the Volvo, Whitbread and Julves Verne races (see second example). You can find out about the classes and events on line\u2014there is not enough room here to list them.  The scene: sailing the 5o5 at the St. Francis Yacht Club in San Francisco. The \u2018Five-Oh\u2019 racing dinghy, designed by John Westell in 1953 but still as modern as today and a thrill to sail and race, is five meters and five centimeters of brutal physical test, a beast in boat\u2019s clothing. Beautiful but deadly. The crew handles the jib and spinnaker, and rides the trapeze. Managing the sheets requires an athletic combination of dexterity and strength, as well as instant-by-instant judgment. It also demands indifference to pain, as the wires and ropes cut and burn\u2014leather sailing gloves, sans fingertips, are standard equipment. The trapeze, you ask? A pair of wires, one hanging from the mast on each side, with a large steel ring a foot above the deck, which must be clipped to a hook on the crew\u2019s torso harness. It enables the crew get his or her weight outboard to keep the boat upright for planing performance, feet on the gunwale. Weight shifting is done by bending the knees to get body mass inboard when the wind lessens. Lose footing on that narrow gunwale, and the crew risks sliding forward and inboard, out of control, perhaps falling into the jib upside down and initiating an inevitable capsize\u2014unpopular because capsizing, though recoverable rapidly, loses races. Too often a crew is hanging over the water, horizontal, butting the body into the waves, taking half of them in the face, occasionally ducking and letting the skipper collect a big one, for grins. The boat behaves like a demented hydroplane, hurtling from wave top to wave top in a lather of foam, on the edge of control. On San Francisco Bay, where we most often sail, a wet suit is essential both for skipper and crew, to stave off the bone-numbing, fifty-degree Pacific Ocean chill. Several layers of wet sweaters bring the combatants up to fighting weight, life preserver on top. We never finish a race in the Bay\u2019s typical heavy weather without being falling-down cold, wet and exhausted. All part of the Five-Oh\u2019s ineffable charm. Solution: head for the bar.  The Middle Watch is the loneliest and toughest time at sea\u2014midnight to four AM. My skipper is alone at the helm while I and the rest of the on-deck watch await his call to work the boat if required. His rig is set satisfactorily and I know that he wants to avoid calling on us to make more or less sail. I and the other crew members on watch with me are huddled sensibly behind the stout canvas windbreak just forward of the helm station, hoping that we will not be needed on this four-hour watch, a downwind dash; the other crewmembers are below\u2014sleeping, with luck. I watch my skipper as he holds the wheel in gloved hands on this brutal night. He is sensing the wind and waves with every nerve, living intensely in the moment. The boat is riding a stupendous following sea in the Roaring Forties between forty and fifty degrees of southerly latitude, the southern Indian Ocean. Strong west-to-east winds here are caused by the combination of air being displaced from the Equator toward the South Pole and the Earth's rotation, plus the absence of landmasses to serve as windbreaks. The wave crests are a quarter mile or more apart. We are planing magnificently, surfing the waves, propelled at thirty-plus knots by a quartering southwesterly gale straight from the Antarctic. Similar but even stronger conditions occur in more southerly latitudes and are called by seamen the Furious Fifties and Shrieking or Screaming Sixties. We are on a broad reach on the starboard tack, almost a run, the boom fully extended. The noise of our passage is deafening\u2014the thunder of wind and waves fills my ears, the shriek of gusts in the rigging as counterpoint, as white water sluices the decks of the hulls. Atop the crests the wind is cleaving to its reputation at these latitudes: roaring, at over forty knots, though in the troughs it dies to half that speed. We hurtle down the front of the waves and rush up the next crest, surfing gloriously, the hulls\u2019 forward halves well out of the water as they punch through the broken wavetops. An almost full moon illuminates the scene, shining intermittently through scudding cloud. This, I think, is Sailing, capital S. It consumes all of us, twenty-four hours a day and night. I know from studying the charts before coming on watch that we have plenty of sea room, with no risk of being impaled on a lee shore, so we can drive the boat as hard and fast as she will go. We are following the vaunted clipper-ship route of sailing lore, the Cape of Good Hope far behind us. We left the Kerguelen Islands far to port earlier, in daylight. My skipper glances down from time to time to check the dimly-lit binnacle, to make sure he is on course, heading for our next scheduled landfall\u2014Cape Leeuwin in southwestern Australia, 3,000 miles to the east, then south of New Zealand. Beyond New Zealand: around Cape Horn, the tip of South America, then north into the Atlantic and home. How simple and direct that sounds. It involves days of relentless effort. Just as well that we are sailing in Southern Hemisphere summer. I glance to port and see that the wind is tearing the tops off the wave crests, sending striations of foam in streaks down and ahead\u2014about Force 8 on the Beaufort Scale, I reckon. A fair blow. I recall that Atlantic crossing in Triumph, so long ago, in worse weather\u2014Force 10. We are racking up miles against the inexorable clock. The Jules Verne Trophy that is our goal is fifteen thousand miles and many days away at Ushant off the French coast but this should help bring it home, if the diabolical mid-Atlantic doldrums spare us\u2014this attempt is timed to minimize that risk. Indeed, not a day, hour, minute or second passes when I do not wonder why I ever decided to go on this terrifying trip. Yet at this moment I am living ecstatically, though wet, cold and exhausted. ",
