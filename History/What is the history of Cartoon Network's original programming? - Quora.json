            "answer_text": "I can only speak to one specific program, Regular Show, because I voice a character on it, and have since it's pilot.The series' creator, J.G. Quintel, was already working at Cartoon Network as a storyboard artist when he pitched the pilot as part of CN's \"Cartoonstitute Program.\" The program was created to allow aspiring artists to pitch show concepts which would then, if accepted, receive production funding for a pilot to be released on Youtube. The response to the pilot would determine which shows were approved for production. Of the 15 or so original programs that were part of the Cartoonstitute series, two were picked up: Regular Show, and the show that would become Uncle Grandpa. Regular Show is recording its sixth season now (while still airing its fifth). This relatively long run marks a departure from previous Cartoon Network strategy, which has been to cancel even successful series after three or four seasons in favor of new programming.I know this doesn't completely answer your question, but I hope it helps.
