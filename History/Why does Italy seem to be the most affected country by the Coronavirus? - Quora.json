            "answer_text": "There are some interesting points posted already and all need to be taken into account.But there are a couple of posts that focus mainly on the age in the Italian population. Others say that Italians have not been hit harder, they just test more. However, looking at the figures, this can\u2019t really be the explanations for this. Some focused on deaths. Those could be explained by the age of the population. But what about infections? While the death rate is exceptionally high, Italy also has one of the highest numbers of infections in total. The virus does also infect the younger population, they are just not as likely to die as the elder. As I assume that Italians in general do not die quicker than other nations, there must be other reasons for the high numbers in Italy. You may say, that Italy has a higher % of elderly, which is actually right. But below we will see, that the amount of older people can\u2019t really be the only reason why Italy is so far off. There must be other reasons than just age. Because if you look at the actual figures, Italy is not that far away from for example Germany when it comes to age (see below). Yet the mortality rate is quite different (see first table). I was trying to find out what could be the reason behind this. Disclaimer: I picked Germany, because both countries are fairly close in terms of \u201cage\u201d and the numbers are quite different. One point that I found was the number ITU beds per 100.000 inhabitants. Germany has somewhere around 29, Italy was at around 12 (but still higher than many other countries in Europe, like France and Spain). So besides the high age, this could also be a reason. Also, Italy was hit early and probably somehow \u201csurprised\u201d. I read an article of an (anonymous) Italian physcian, where she admitted and regreted that they did not take the virus serious enough at the beginning (\u201cPatient 1\u201d was moving from hospital to hospital for 36h infecting people, before he was tested, for example). We can\u2019t really blame Italy and the Italian health system for this. No one was really prepared for all this. But we can\u2019t just say it is because of the \u201colder population\u201d, because Japan, has a far older population and Germany isn\u2019t that much younger (21,5% vs. 23% over 65 Years See table 2). Here a little graphic that highlights that the \u201cdeath rate\u201d in some countries is much higher than in others:  So if we look at this, Italy is reaching the 10% ration (death vs. infected). Currently I have no good explanation for this. Why would the \u201cdeath rate\u201d be so much higher for Italy, than for example for Germany, Austria, Norway, Switzerland, South Korea, etc. Yes, Italy is \u201colder\u201d than most of the other countries, but Germany and Portugal aren\u2019t \u201cyoung\u201d countries either. Here some figures from Wikipedia (based on numbers from 2017, but shouldn\u2019t have changed that much):  So even if there is a range from 23% (Italy) to 19,2% (Austria), the ratio of people above 65 years is not THAT MUCH higher in Italy than in other countries. In terms of Median Age Germany is actually older than Italy:  And the first figures are in %. If we compare the absolute figures, Italy and its 60,243,406 inhabitants with Germany and its 83,149,300 inhabitants, there should be 4 Million more people above 65 years in Germany (17.877.100) than in Italy (13.855.983). So if age is the component that makes the difference, Germany should have a lot more infected and dead than Italy by now. If we take the 125.950.000 Japanese, this becomes even clearer (27% are 65+). So there must be other, far more important reasons, why Italy is so far off the curve from most other countries. This is not about blaming anyone. No one really knows about the virus. But to understand it, we must look at the different countries, the different approaches and what works and what doesn\u2019t. Obviously something doesn\u2019t work well for Italy. Of course we also don\u2019t know in what \u201cphase\u201d of the virus everyone is right now. And of course \u201cItaly\u201d is not all equal, just like other countries. There are pockets with very high numbers and others that are not so affected. But \u201cblaming\u201d it purely on the age of the Italian population is too easy at the current stage. We could now say \u201cGermany might not be reporting their deaths correctly\u201d, which I find far less likely than Italy probably having far more people infected than reported. Overall I think the number of deaths is probably fairly accurate for most countries, but the number of infected is probably far higher than reported for most countries. This is part of the nature. Not everyone has been tested, of course. So while not being able to give definite answers, I hope I could clarify a few things. I think it is very early to say what are the reasons. But we need to look into the numbers with caution, we might be able to identify some areas that require further investigations and that allow to create hypotesis for science. Blaming specific countries or pointing fingers doesn\u2019t help anyone. But we need to see what happens in countries with low death rates to see and understand, if this is just pure \u201cluck\u201d or if there is something going on that might serve as an example for other countries. Statements like \u201cIts because of the age\u201d or \u201cItaly tests more\u201d are not helpful, because when looking at the figures, these statements actually seem not to be true. ",

            "answer_text": "As sad as it may sound, Italy has been hit very hard by SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen that causes COVID-19) because of a series of factors and their critical interplay: the huge tourist flow Italy experiences every year. This is a no-brainer. Among the three most sought worldwide destinations there are France, Spain, and Italy. In other words: the more people travel around the globe, the more this virus spreads. COVID-19 is not like ebola that requires exchange of body fluids (e.g. blood) and this, in turn, implies random interaction at, say, grocery stores, work, and so forth. Tourism sure helps from this point of view, because Italy is (relatively) small and crowded which means high population density;the high percentage of elderly that Italy is made of. Italy has the world\u2019s second oldest people (after Japan), and SARS-CoV-2 is particularly \u201cfond\u201d of old people. Alas;Italian lifestyle. Everybody knows how important family and family ties are, from an Italian point of view. This means large gatherings of people are very common and happen quite often, be it for social events, religious acts, or simply family meals. Statistics-wise, this is a very favourable way for a virus to hijack new host cells;underestimating the real threat played an important role, too. Thank you to all those who pointed this out in the comments. At the beginning, the mantra was \u201cit's just another flu. It will go away in zero time\". Well, no. It did not happen;the important business connections some regions of Italy have with China and/or Germany, which are now looked into. Enough said (no offence intended. Please, don't get me wrong).Although there sure is a certain percentage of idiots who do not to give a damn on common sense (there has been plenty of fining lately anywhere in Italy for not following the lockdown instructions), this is exactly what has been happening anywhere else in the world and, therefore, can be reasonably ruled out as a major cause. Italy may have drawn the shortest straw, being the first European country to experience the so-called corona virus. However, there are solid reasons to understand why this pandemia is taking a huge toll on it. Nonetheless, the health system is an exceptionally robust one and, although severely battered, is fighting back furiously. A whole nation is doing so, actually:   In the image (taken from www.cadena100.es): Alessia Bonari, an Italian nurse who shared a pic of herself after a 10-hour shift. Yes, those marks on her face are due to the safety mask she had to keep on all that time.  EDIT (20-3-2020): I had to disable comments, because I couldn't keep up with them. I do apologise. Also, threads were turning into uncalled for telling-off and lecturing. Both are beyond the scope of these lines of mine. Sorry about that. ",
