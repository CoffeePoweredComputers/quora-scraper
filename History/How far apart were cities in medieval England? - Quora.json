            "answer_text": "In the UK and Europe hamlets and villages tend to be about 5\u20136 kilometres (3\u20134 miles) apart which allowed a person to walk from one to the other in about an hour; so a visit in even half a day was possible. A horse and cart similar. Towns tend to be about three times further apart (15k-20k) - if there was a market you could reach it from the villages in about an hour; from a neighbouring town in about 3 on foot - say dawn to arrive at 8 a.m. Horse and cart similar. Major towns and cities tend to be about three times further apart than the towns - say 55\u201370 kilometres. Towns could reach them in half a day; nearby villags in less. All major towns would have important markets - local terders could make it with horse and cart and a very early start. Otherwise it was an overnight - hence the numbers of hostels and inns. A glance at a map of northern France will show this better than any other. In fact any area with fairly flat countryside will look fairly similar. All this can change dramatically in hilly country - in fact it partly accounts for upland area having fewer habitaions/settlements and people. ",

            "answer_text": "I stared at this for a long, long time because of course most of the cities of medieval England are cities or towns of modern England, they haven't moved you can just get directions between Durham and York cathedrals on google maps. They will give you a rough idea of how long it takes to walk between the two. So I'm assuming that this question means how long did it take to get around by foot, cart, ship and horseback in the Medieval age. Here I would simply cheat and use Standford's Orbis which is set up for the Roman age, but would give you somewhat rough ideas about how long to get from place to place. http://orbis.stanford.edu/ ",
