            "answer_text": "A quick trip to the Browning Arms Museum in Ogden can answer that question. John M. Browning Firearms Museum There\u2019s little in common between these two magazine fed, air cooled, gas operated rifles. The later Browning BAR sporting rifle is half the weight of the M1918A2 automatic rifle (the most numerous variant of the squad automatic weapon\u2014the USA produced some 352,000 military BARs and there were other manufacturers and copies made in other nations\u2014Poland used a variant of the BAR). The sporter\u2019s internals are designed to make conversion to full auto fire difficult and the three and four shot magazines are rigged up so that the gun has to be redesigned to take bigger magazines. The BAR military \u201cmachine gun\u201d was originally designed as a select-fire rifle to replace the Springfield service rifle offering full- and semiautomatic fire\u2014the latter was supposed to be its normal mode of fire and automatic fire was \u201cfor emergency use only.\u201d Most of the BAR\u2019s issued to the US Army, Navy and Marines were M1918A2 automatic rifles with a rapid fire rate (call it about 600 rounds per minute cyclic) and a slow fire rate (about 350 rounds per minute cyclic)\u2014with no provision for semiautomatic fire. Skilled BAR men could tap off single shots, but that put excessive wear and tear on the fire control group. The M1918 family fired from the open bolt position and had 20 round magazines standard (during World War One some 40 shot magazines were issued, but they didn\u2019t last). The sporting BAR fires from the closed bolt and uses either three shot magazines (magnum calibers) or four shot (standard calibers). There\u2019s not a whole lot of similarity between the two\u2014except in circles that can\u2019t tell the difference between a hand grenade and a hydrogen bomb. ",

            "answer_text": "Other than the name, there are no parts that these two designs have in common. Designed for entirely different applications. The military BAR M1918 (WW1 & 2), M1918A1 (1930\u2019s) & M1918A2 (WW2) are hefty selective fire weapons, originally design by John Moses Browning. USA manufactured versions in .30\u203206 calibre, utilize a quick change, detachable twenty shot magazine. Colt was licensed to sell Browning products in the USA, and developed the Colt Model 1925 (better known as the R 75), R 75A* and R 80, which are \u201clightweight\u201d(sic) selective fire automatic rifles sold under the Colt Monitor name. Essentially an improved version of the military BAR, the Monitor was essentially the culmination of Colt's work on improving the BAR after World War I. Sold from 1925 to about 1931, the Monitor was marketed to law enforcement agencies and some militaries, but failed to sell well in either regard. The FBI purchased 90 R 80 models and designated them as their official fighting rifle. Thes eare now a rare and collectible version of the original BAR, as only 125 were made for North America. *One final iteration of the Monitor, the R 75A, was produced for the Netherlands Purchasing Commission from August to December 1942, with 832 produced, presumably to be sent into combat. The R 75A is regarded as the final iteration of the commercial Browning Automatic Rifle. The Browning BAR sporting rifle, on the other hand is an entirely different commercial semi automatic with a four shot magazine, the floor plate of this is hinged to the bottom of the receiver. It was designed by Marcel Olinger and Bruce Browning, John Moses\u2019 grandson. It has been produced since the late 1960\u2019s, at Browning\u2019s Belgian factory, with some final assembly in Portugal since the 1970\u2019s. ",
