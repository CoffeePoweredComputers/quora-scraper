Ok, we might have won this one. Germany, Italy, Hungary, Tchechoslovakia? Unlikely that we could have won that. Slowenia? Eventualy. Our potential to start a successfull war was pretty limited. We would have been stopped pretty soon. That would have not been enough for a world war. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not quite understand this question. If we are talking about an interest Germany that remains politically inert while contemporary Austria becomes an aggressor, then quite simply the post-war Austrian republic would not be nearly large enough to threaten its neighbours. Never mind Italy, Czechoslovakia should be able to handle itself. Even Hungary and Yugoslavia could wage successful defensive wars. ",
