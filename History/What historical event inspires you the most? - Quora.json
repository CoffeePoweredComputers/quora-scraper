            "answer_text": "The Renaissance Nothing can compare to the age of the Renaissance. Ignorance was being pushed aside and the world was beginning to see the mathematics of a falling apple, the sparkle of a dewdrop, and the wonder of a distant star. It was during this time that great men and women questioned tradition and standing beliefs. People learned that there was still a lot to learn in this great world. The earth was not the center of the universe. There were planets besides our own. There was a world of mathematics that had functioned just under the surface where no man had yet looked. There was beauty in colors that art began to acknowledge and share with the whole world. The Renaissance gave us new light, pushing aside the Dark Ages when man was directed by superstition and fear. The Renaissance gave the unexplainable a face and a name. There would be no more fear. Curiosity was encouraged despite opposition from those that longed to remain in the past. The Renaissance was an awakening to the world and was the beginning of all our curiosity today.

            "answer_text": "World War II is endlessly fascinating for me because it occurred in such varied fields of combat, from the tundra of Finland to the isolated jungle valleys of Sumatra. Under the sea and in the air. The latest book I\u2019ve read showed me where much of the war was won. Tuxedo Park told me about a millionaire named Alfred Loomis organizing a lab at MIT which developed a hundred different kinds of radar and got them off the drawing table and into production in a dazzlingly short period of time which gave the US and the UK the upper hand in the air, out at sea, and on the ground. The Rad Lab at MIT was one of the places that WWII was won. Another was a book about a mechanic/ airman in the South Pacific, named \u201cPappy\u201d Gunn, who had the brilliance and the balls to reconfigure the B-25 into a gunship/bomber with eight machine guns in the nose that allowed it to approach a ship \u201con the deck\u201d with guns blazing to counter fire from the ship. Then it would pull up and skip some bombs into the side of it, turning it into a very effective bomber from one that had bombed from altitude with little success. That changed the course of the war in the South Pacific. ",
