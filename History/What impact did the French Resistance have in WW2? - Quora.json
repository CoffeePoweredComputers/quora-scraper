            "answer_text": "Their impact was pretty big. They played a key role by: Providing the Allies with precious military intelligence;Laying groundwork for the D-Day invasion (mostly by sabotaging Nazi infrastructure);Subsequently offering support to Allied troops during the early stages of the Invasion of Normandy and Provence;fighting alongside the Allies, after forming the more regular French Forces of the Interior.Other roles, before the invasion: Guerrilla warfare;Anti-Nazi propaganda (underground newspapers, radio etc.);Organizing the escape of Allied soldiers, pilots and spies.Now consider this: most of them were simple civilians, with little or no training at all!

            "answer_text": "Their actions weren't really intended to have a lasting impact; they were just trying to make life hard for the Germans, assist downed Allied pilots, and provide intelligence to the Allies, especially in the period before D-Day. The lasting impact -- apart from their contribution to their own liberation as a whole -- was to be something about that era that the French could look back on with pride. Also, they were really very divided, but De Gaulle promoted the myth that all France was united in resisting the occupation. If he had not done so, there might very well have been a civil war in the power vacuum that followed the liberation. ",
