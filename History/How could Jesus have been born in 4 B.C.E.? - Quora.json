Jesus' purported birth is 1AD was largely a miscalculation on the part of a 6th century monk known as Dionysius Exiguus (\u201cDennis the Small\u201d). This is what Pope Benedict once claimed in a book.  \u201cThe calculation of the beginning of our calendar \u2014 based on the birth of Jesus \u2014 was made by Dionysius Exiguus, who made a mistake in his calculations by several years,\u201d the Pope writes in the book, which went on sale around the world with an initial print run of a million copies. \u201cThe actual date of Jesus\u2019s birth was several years before.\u201d Dennis the Small, who was born in Eastern Europe, is credited with being the \u201cinventor\u201d of the modern calendar and the concept of the Anno Domini era. The assertion that the Christian calendar is based on a false premise is not new \u2014 many historians believe that Christ was born sometime between 7BC and 2BC. But the fact that doubts over one of the keystones of Christian tradition have been raised by the leader of the world\u2019s one billion Roman Catholics is striking. As for 25th of December\u2026Constantine set the date to correspond to the Roman Saturnalia with the idea that it would allow Christians to more easily merge into Roman culture. Luke 2:8 indicates that Jesus was born when pastures had grass for the sheep to eat. This only happens from about April to about October. The rest of the time the animals are in pens and fed silage.  However, many of us forget that our Messiah is born a Jew, according to Hebrew prophesy. The following prophetically ties into everything\u2026 THE FEAST OF TRUMPETS AND MESSIANIC PROPHESY Yeshu bar Mariam (\u201cJesus Son of Mary\u201d, in Aramaic) was born on the 1st day of Tishri (\u05ea\u05b4\u05bc\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9)\u2014known as the Autumn month\u2014during the year 3760, according to the Hebrew calendar. This coincides with the Feast of Trumphets (\u05e8\u05b9\u05d0\u05e9\u05c1 \u05d4\u05b7\u05e9\u05b8\u05bc\u05c1\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4, Rosh Hashanah). Ie. \u05d0\u05f3 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b0\u05ea\u05b4\u05e9\u05c1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d2'\u05ea\u05e9\"\u05e1 (1 Rosh Hoshanah 3+400+300+60) Or otherwise the 29th of September, during the year 2BC, according to the Gregorian calendar. The Birth would have taken place either after sundown (at dusk) on the 29th, or after Midnight. Since in the Hebrew calendar a day begins at sunset and not at midnight, then that would be September 30th, instead of the 29th, while still being the 1st of Tishri. STAR OF BETHLEHEM The Hebrew word for star is \u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05c4\u05db\u05b8\u05d1 (kok\u0101b). However, in biblical times the same word was used for planets and other heavenly bodies. Thus, a popular explanation for the Star of Bethlehem is that it was actually a conjunction of Jupiter and Venus that presumably occurred on June 17, 2BC. However that's not the only possible celestial occurrence in 2BC. JUPITER, VENUS AND THE STAR REGULUS Fairly recently, there has been a new theory by a lawyer from Texas. Rick Larson has done a lot of research and found a new contender. He looked at old manuscripts and found that the date of Herod's death might have been copied incorrectly and could well have been in 1BC not BC (more on that later). This gives us another three years to look for stars. Mr Larson found that there was a conjunction of Jupiter and Venus in Leo, followed by three conjunctions of Jupiter and the star Regulus (which is in the constellation of Leo the Lion), followed by a second conjunction of Jupiter and Venus in Leo ninth months later. And then six months after that Jupiter 'stops' (goes into retrograde) in Virgo. Here is the full article, exploring all the possibilities: The Star of Bethlehem on whychristmas?com QUIRINIUS CENSUS, 3\u20132 B.C. In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria. And everyone went to their own town to register. \u2014Luke 1\u20133 Roman historian Tacitus wrote in his Annals Book III that when Quirinius died in 21 AD, Tiberius Caesar \"requested that the Senate pay tribute...with a public funeral\", and described him as a \"tireless soldier, who had by his faithful services become consul during the reign of Augustus, ... later was appointed to be an adviser to Caius Caesar in the government of Armenia...\" Jewish historian Josephus wrote in more detail about the census of Judea around 6 AD that Quirinius undertook as the governor of Syria. (Antiquities XVIII, 26 [ii.1]. However, Luke states that the census in question was the \u201cfirst\u201d, meaning that there other censuses. This obviously shows that there was also another census which was taken later. This is most likely the one referenced by Josephus. It is quite possible that Quirinius was actually given the same position twice to govern Syria (the Greek expression \u1f21\u03b3\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 is used in Luke 2:2, which is often translated \u201cgovernor\u201d but really just means \u201cto be leading\u201d or \u201cin charge of\u201d). The province also happened to include Judea as a political subdivision. The first time would have been when he was leading military action against the Homonadensians during the period between 12 and 2 B.C. His title may even have been \u201cmilitary governor.\u201d A Latin inscription discovered in 1764 adds weight to the idea that Quirinius was in a position of authority in Syria on two separate occasions. There was definitely a taxing during this time and therefore, quite possible, an associated census, the details of which may have been common knowledge in Luke's time, but are now lost to us. KING HEROD'S DEATH Both Luke and Matthew mention as occurring during (Luke 1:5; Matthew 2:1). Josephus relates Herod\u2019s death to a lunar eclipse. This is generally regarded as a reference to a lunar eclipse in 4 B.C. Therefore it is often said that Jesus was born in 4 B.C. But physics professor John A. Cramer, in a letter to BAR, has pointed out that there was another lunar eclipse visible in Judea\u2014in fact, two\u2014in 1 B.C., which would place Herod\u2019s death\u2014and Jesus\u2019 birth\u2014at the turn of the era. Below, read letters published in the Q&C section of BAR debating the dates of Herod\u2019s death, Jesus\u2019 birth and to which lunar eclipse Josephus was referring.

            "answer_text": "There is compelling evidence to believe that Jesus was born in the year 2 B.C./B.C.E., during the month of June.  A celebration of that birth likely was held a few months later, on the 25th of December, 2 B.C./B.C.E. In this matter, the most useful piece of information is the Star of Bethlehem.  While many suppose the Star to be a fictional element to the Gospel birth narratives, or at least an embellishment of a comet or meteor, modern astronomy and historical findings have demonstrated that it most likely refers to the planet Jupiter, whose behavior in 2 B.C. perfectly matches the descriptions in the Gospel accounts.  Matthew's details are not embellishments; they recorded genuine historical astronomical events. To clarify, this answer is not using astrology as a vindication of Scripture.  Rather, this answer is treating the book of Matthew as a historical document, one whose points can be studied and verified.  If Matthew recorded accurately a genuine astronomical event that we can verify today, it accomplishes two things: 1) it provides a solid reference point for finding the date of these events,  and 2) it demonstrates that many of the facts in this account which used to be considered fiction are instead historical facts. in his Gospel, Matthew lists nine details about the Star: Its unique behavior signified birth.  (Matt 2:2)Its unique behavior signified kingship.  (Matt 2:2)Its unique behavior signified a connection with the Jewish nation, and with the tribe of Judah, specifically.  (Matt 2:2)It rose in the east, like other stars.  (Matt 2:2)It appeared at a precise time.  (Matt 2:7)Herod didn't know when it appeared.  (Matt 2:3,7)It endured over time.  (Matt 2:2,7-10)It was ahead of the Magi as they went south from Jerusalem to Bethlehem. (Matt 2:9)It stopped over Bethlehem.  (Matt 2:9)(Note: If you check these on your own, make sure you use a literal, word-for-word translation of the Bible, such as the ESV, and not a paraphrase like the Message, or thought-for-thought translation, like the NIV). With the use of modern-day computers that can cycle back the sky and show us what stars were doing in the years around Jesus' birth, we can see that each of these nine details is met by Jupiter in the years of 3-2 B.C./B.C.E.  This is documented extensively at the following link: http://www.bethlehemstar.net/dance/dance.htm The link discusses Jupiter's behavior much more specifically, but to summarize how it fills the 9 points above: 1.  (We'll return to this after we set the stage with the following) 2.  Jupiter, the \"king\" planet, moved into conjunction with Regulus, the \"king\" star (both of these were attributed with kingship long before the birth of Jesus).  Rather than a single conjunction, however, in September of 3 B.C. Jupiter made a triple conjunction around Regulus, in a sense drawing a crown, or halo, over the star.  This is a very rare event, and would likely have caught the magi's attention. 3.  This triple-crowning of Regulus by Jupiter occurred in the constellation of Leo, the Lion, at the beginning of the Jewish New Year.  The Lion has long been the symbol of the Jewish tribe of Judah.  If these magi astronomers had connections to the Jewish nation (which would make sense given the story in the book Daniel), and if they were looking for the Messiah based on the many Old Testament prophecies of His coming, then this would naturally bring the tribe of Judah to mind. 1.  (Back to the birth).  There are two astronomical details that lead to the concept of a birth.  First, immediately following Leo after this triple conjunction, Virgo, the virgin, rises.  It is in a unique position: the sun is in its middle, and at its feet is a new moon (at the beginning of a new phase), symbolizing the beginning of a new life.  The book of Revelation mentions this in 12:1-5, when it describes the birth of Messiah in poetic imagery, saying that \"a great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head.  She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.\"  This demonstrates quite clearly that the earliest Christians understood these astronomical event to refer to the birth of their Messiah.       While this astronomical event is enough to signify a virgin giving birth in and of itself, there is a second event.  In June of 2 B.C. (exactly nine months after these first series of symbols), Jupiter passed near Venus, the Mother Planet.  The conjunction was so bright that it formed the most brilliant star ever witnessed in the night sky.  They were so close that the naked eye could not distinguish them, and at this specific point in their orbits, they were shining at full illumination.  For an astronomer who witnessed this in the area of Babylon, this conjunction would have happened low in the western sky, directly over Israel to the west.  The star was, in a very real sense, \"westward leading.\" 4.  Jupiter rises in the east, setting in the west during its conjunction with Venus, indicating a direction for the wise men/magi to follow. 5.  The conjunctions appeared at precise, identifiable times.  Anyone watching the sky in the ancient world could verify them.  Anyone today using a standard astronomy software program can verify them.  They really happened. 6.  Herod was unaware of these things, according to Matthew's account.  The events in the sky were interesting, but they need the proper interpretive framework to be understood as the Magi saw them (namely, the expectation of a Jewish Messiah being born in the tribe of Judah). 7.  The events took place over a span of time that fits Matthew's account.  If Jesus was conceived in September of 3 B.C., when the first signs appeared, He would have been born in June of 2 B.C., when the second signs appeared.  The third group of signs, which I'll address in a moment, appeared a few months later, giving the Magi sufficient time to leave their homeland and journey to Jerusalem, looking for this king who was born. 8.  In December of 2 B.C., a traveler at Jerusalem could look south and see Jupiter sitting directly over the town of Bethlehem, just 5 miles to the south.  This fits with Matthew's account, which says that after the magi spoke with Herod in Jerusalem, the looked and saw the star leading the way to Bethlehem. 9.  Matthew's account also says the star came to rest over Bethlehem.  At precisely December 25, 2 B.C., Jupiter entered retrograde motion.  In other words, it stopped; its apparent motion ceased, right as it hovered over Bethlehem to an observer looking south from Jerusalem.  The magi, being life-long stargazers, would have known this, and recognized its significance.  Given that the journey is so short, it is reasonable to suppose they hurried to Bethlehem and found Jesus, still a baby, and worshipped Him, as Matthew's account says. This data demonstrates that Matthew's account is not fictitious, but rather factual.  You can take the details of his narrative, even details of a seemingly mythical star, and find them still written in the skies.  This indicates that Matthew did not invent the narrative; if the details we can verify are accurate, then there is a high probability that the rest is accurate, as well. Thus, if this data is correct, and there seems to be no astronomical reason to doubt it, then Jesus would have been born in June of 2 B.C.   At this point, many modern students of ancient history will chime in and say that the historical data contradicts this possibility.  They will assert that Herod the Great died in 4 B.C., thus we cannot be expected to believe that the magi visited Herod in Jerusalem during the year of 2 B.C. Yet modern scholarship has cleared up this problem.  We assume Herod died on 4 B.C. because of the writings of Josephus in his Antiquities.  A recent study at the British Library in London examined their earliest copies of Josephus' work, and they discovered something surprising: a printing error was made in 1544 by a typesetter on precisely the data we use to ascertain the date of the death of Herod.  Every single copy of Josephus' work before 1544 supports the 1 B.C. date of Herod's death; every copy after 1544 supports the 4 B.C. date.  In addition to this, studies by Andrew Steinmann and Ernest L. Martin in the past few years corroborate the 1 B.C. date of the death of Herod.  All of this is explained and extensively cited at http://www.bethlehemstar.net/stage/stage.htm (See fotenotes 10 and 11, particularly).  Given all this evidence, we can comfortably say that Herod died in 1 B.C., and the 4 B.C. date is result of a simple type-setting error.  Thus, there is plenty of time for the Biblical accounts, depicting Jesus' birth during the reign of Herod, His family's departure to Egypt, and their return after the death of Herod. With this information, we can say with a good degree of certainty that Jesus was born in June of 2 B.C., with a celebration of that birth taking place on December 25, 2 B.C.  I will also deal with the claims above that the Gospel accounts are contradictory and mutually exclusive.  I do not believe this to be the case, and I believe the argument asserting their contradiction is based on groundless speculation, not on fact.  Seeing as this is not the main issue under discussion in this question, I will deal with this in a response comment to Tim's post, which asserted the contradiction, rather than in my main answer. ",
