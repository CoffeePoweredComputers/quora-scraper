            "answer_text": "Plato was not only a great philosopher, a seminal thinker who immortalized the dialectic, life, and thought of his teacher, Socrates (who left no writings), he was also a great poet whose dialogues dramatized Socrates\u2019 personality and thought as well as hi\u0010s own. Plato\u2019s dialogues have captured the imagination of philosophically-minded spirits for over 2300 years and continue to charm those who read them. Plato was also the teacher of Aristotle, who regarded Plato as one of the noblest human be\u0010nags who ever lived. Aristotle\u2019s \u0010influence upon human thought endures to this day i\u0010n such fields as biology and logic. (Darwin, for example, clai\u0010med to be indebted to Aristotle for his theory of evolution.) Plotinus is regarded as a \u201cNeo-Platonist,\u201d expounding teach\u0010ing previously associated with Plato. Those who read his Enneads may be touched by their depth of thought and immersion in the divine, but they simply do not have the compelling attract\u0010ion or poetry of the Platonic dialogues, nor did Plotinus have an Aristotle to follow him. He has therefore never gained the reputation or following that Plato has. To speak metaphorically, one can imagine choosing the Platonic dialogues as the only literature one takes to a desert island in great preference to the Enneads. ",

            "answer_text": "Reading their works one might easily believe that of the two Plato gained a clearer, fuller and more sustained vision of the Form of the Good. Plato was a supreme literary artist and poet as well as a philosopher. Plotinus\u2019 prose attains the level of poetry in places, but with nothing like the consistency we see in Plato\u2019s works. Plato\u2019s extensive use of myths helped considerably in presenting his message to a broader audience. Just consider, for example, the impact on the collective cultural imagination of the Cave Allegory \u2014 to which nothing comparable is found in Plotinus\u2019 works. Plotinus is really offering a sustained commentary (albeit an inspired one) on Plato\u2019s philosophy. Plotinus tends towards ascetical dualism \u2014 it was said that he never felt comfortable being in a body, so detached from the world was he. Plato, on the other hand, more successfully combines mysticism and soaring intellectual insight with the concerns of human existence. In other words, Plato is more of what we would today call a humanist. Plotinus produced otherworldly treatises; Plato used stories of men at drinking parties to illumine his readers. ",
