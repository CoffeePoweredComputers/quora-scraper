            "answer_text": "Apparently, it is possible to die from laughter. Of course, it's extremely rare, so it will hopefully not deter you from laughing as often and as hard as possible, but keep in mind: your happiness may be the death of you.Dying of laughter is a result cardiac arrest or asphyxiation due to an excessive fit of laughter. You know when you laugh so much that you can't breathe? Imagine that multiplied by a million, and then dying. Yep, it really does happen. This kind of demise can also be caused by pathological laughing, for which there can be many different causes of death. Also, the chances of dying of an explosive fit of laughter are likelier if you have some other medical issue going on, like indigestion.The first people to have reportedly died of laughter can be traced back to Ancient Greece, but recent cases are much more reliable.    In 1975, Alex Mitchell died of heart failure after 25 consecutive minutes of laughter after watching an episode of \"The Goodies\". His wife wrote a letter to the creators of the show, thanking them for making his last moments so enjoyable (an autopsy of Mitchell's granddaughter revealed that she had a heart condition that he might have also had, thus contributing to his passing away)In 1989, Ole Bentzen died watching \"A Fish Called Wanda\", also of cardiac arrest. It is said that his heart was beating at between 250 to 500 beats per minute before he died.The most recent case, in 2003, was that of Damnoen Saen-um, a Thai ice cream salesman. He had an uncontrollable fit of laughter in his sleep, from which his wife could not wake him. It is unclear whether he died of heart failure or asphyxiation. Well, now you know the hidden dangers of laughing. You have been warned. Giggle at your own risk. ",

            "answer_text": "There is indeed such a thing as Death from laughter. Laughter has many beneficial effects on the body (increases bloodflow, reduces stress hormones, and has an obvious psychological benefit). But it's also an involuntary and violent reaction, and any violent bodily function can have serious negative consequences. In this case, up to and including death. For instance, I'm sure many of us from time to time have laughed so hard that we struggled to breath. If that kind of uncontrollable laughter lasts for long enough then, theoretically, it can deprive the body of enough oxygen to kill you by asphyxiation. In one of the earliest known cases, the Greek philosopher Chrysippus is said to have died laughing when he gave his donkey wine and then watched it drunkenly attempt to eat figs. The most recent case that I know of is the case of Damnoen Saen-um cited by Gaby Dickens. However it should be noted that in most cases of \"death by laughter\" another medical issue, such as a heart condition, also played a significant factor. A healthy body is extremely unlikely to laugh itself to death. ",

            "answer_text": "NO. God has made things perfect.  Technically speaking, the heart beat rate increases to 8.5% the normal rythm when you laugh.          The blood is being pumped at a very faster rate which ensures the steady operation of all the organs of our body.                                          This will lead to the increase in metabolism and release of 'happy hormones' like melatonin, oxytocin, endorphins etc.                  The important factor handled here smoothly is the frequency of breath intake when we laugh heavily and uncontrollably. The lungs take in excess oxygen unlike all the other times and it uses for respiration when we are laughing.                                                              So if you are likely to choke when you are laughing, then it should be when you are on a hard recreational drug. Other than that...... Laugh Out Loud. Stay happy. ",

I was in math class & I finished my assignment. My awesome teacher said I could use one of the class chrome-books to play on. I went to YouTube & started watching my favorite YouTuber, Dashiegames. Then I got a stick of gum & started chewing it. I was being INCREDIBLY stupid chewing gum while watching one of his bodies. Anyway, I started laughing so hard during one of the videos & I choked on the gum. I couldn't breathe & my eyes wouldn't stop watering. I had to get walked out of class to the bathroom to cough up the gum. Luckily, I coughed up the gum. ",

You can die from hiccuping, not sleeping, sneezing, blowing wind, running, fear, nose bleeds\u2026just about anything that is extreme will eventually kill you. Humans have at least three nervous systems. One of which is the parasympathetic nervous system. It acts as a brake for extreme feelings. It is there to protect you and keep you functiing in an emergency situation. But it can be over used to the point of failure. Once it's gone susceptibility to severe health problems can occur such as heart attack. I had a friend that thought rage was lots of fun. So, that person raged on until they no longer had a working parasympathetic nervous symptom. At a young age that person experienced multiple heart attacks. That's what I meant by just about anything in extreme will eventually kill you. ",

Although rare, these deaths do happen and are generally as a result of underlying medical conditions like heart disease, asthma, weakened muscles, epilepsy and others. Suddenly, laughter isn't so funny - at least if you're the one dying from it. Extreme laughter can also cause a hernia to protrude, or even dislocate one\u2019s jaw. Ouch! ",

Laughter's normal effects on the body (increased heart rate, etc.) may trigger a secondary event that leads to death. This is often a failure of the heart (i.e. cardiac arrest), and possibly asphyxia as a result of choking (e.g. laughing while eating).  Alternatively cataplexy sufferers may be subject to harm if laughter leads to sudden muscle failure which puts them in a dangerous situation (e.g. while doing something dangerous or holding a knife for example).
