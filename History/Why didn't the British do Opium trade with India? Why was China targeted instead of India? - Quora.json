            "answer_text": "Tl; Dr; It was Indian opium, that the British East India Company facilitated the transportation of, to Chinese, and other merchants, for a cut, see: opium trade The East India Company inherited the centuries old Mughal monopoly on the running of the Bengal opium markets, following the Battle of Buxar. After realizing how profitable the trade had been for the regional, and Portugese merchants, who'd previously bought, and shipped the product to the World, they decided to expand the markets, with new warehouses, and processing facilities opened in the like of Calcutta, to allow merchants to buy in bulk, from local farmers, process the baskets, and sell on to foreign merchants, minus a pitch fee, to allow the trade to flourish. The likes of Stamford Raffles also realised that if he established a halfway house, where Indian opium could be traded, not just the EIC controlled Bengali output, but that from the the Native states, to Chinese merchants, and all outside the oversight / taxes of the Chinese emperor, and EIC, you could save the merchants many a penny, and wouldn't even need to ship the stuff all the way, or establish your own retail outlets, as say the Portugese had in Macau, and Taipei, to benefit from the trade, so founded Singapore. The EIC also forced the establishment of tax free havens, in Hong Kong, and Shanghai, to exploit the Chinese market, giving the worlds Opium merchants a secure base, among the other trades, to operate from in the 19th century, while Singapore was becoming a melting pot of Indian and Chinese opium merchants, prepared to pay a percentage for a secure base.

            "answer_text": "Chinese and Indian goods were heavily demanded in the West. However India was directly controlled by Britain and China was indirectly controlled by Britain.i.e. British could easily get whatever they wanted from India without any considerable opposition. However, they had to import the heavily demanded Chinese goods by a trade that was heavily shifted in the favor of Chinese. So, the British came up with a policy of \u2018The Opium Trade'. British used the fertile Indian soil to grow cash crops like opium ( which led to shortage of food crops and famines in India). They used this Opium to trade with Chinese and shift the trade in their benefit. Therefore, even though India was not directly targeted like China, Indians also suffered from the \u2018opium trade'.
