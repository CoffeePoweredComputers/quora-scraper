            "answer_text": "Am Kingsley by name, a student in Near East University and the German reunification (German: Deutsche Wiedervereinigung) was the process in 1990 in which the German Democratic Republic (GDR, colloquially East Germany; German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik/DDR) became part of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, colloquially West Germany; German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland/BRD) to form the reunited nation of Germany, as provided by Article 23 of the FRG's then constitution (Grundgesetz). The end of the unification process is officially referred to as German unity (German: Deutsche Einheit), celebrated each year on 3 October as German Unity Day (German: Tag der Deutschen Einheit). [1] Berlin was reunited into a single city and was once again designated as the capital of united Germany. The East German government started to falter in May 1989, when the removal of Hungary's border fence with Austria opened a hole in the Iron Curtain. It caused an exodus of thousands of East Germans fleeing to West Germany and Austria via Hungary. The Peaceful Revolution, a series of protests by East Germans, led to the GDR's first free elections on 18 March 1990, and to the negotiations between the GDR and FRG that culminated in a Unification Treaty. [1] Other negotiations between the GDR and FRG and the four occupying powers produced the so-called \"Two Plus Four Treaty\" (Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany) granting full sovereignty to a unified German state, whose two parts were previously bound by a number of limitations stemming from their post-World War II status as occupied regions. The 1945 Potsdam Agreement had specified that a full peace treaty concluding World War II, including the exact delimitation of Germany's postwar boundaries, required to be \"accepted by the Government of Germany when a government adequate for the purpose is established.\" The Federal Republic had always maintained that no such government could be said to have been established until East and West Germany had been united within a free democratic state; but in 1990 a range of opinions continued to be maintained over whether a unified West Germany, East Germany, and Berlin could be said to represent \"Germany as a whole\" for this purpose. The key question was whether a Germany that remained bounded to the east by the Oder\u2013Neisse line could act as a \"united Germany\" in signing the peace treaty without qualification. Under the \"Two Plus, Four Treaty\" both the Federal Republic and the Democratic Republic committed themselves and their unified continuation to the principle that their joint pre-1990 boundaries constituted the entire territory that could be claimed by a Government of Germany, and hence that there were no further lands outside those boundaries that were parts of Germany as a whole. The post-1990 united Germany is not a successor state, but an enlarged continuation of former West Germany. As such, the enlarged Federal Republic of Germany retained the West German seats in international organizations including the European Community (later the European Union) and NATO, while relinquishing membership in the Warsaw Pact and other international organizations to which only East Germany belonged. It also maintains the United Nations membership of the old West Germany. ",

Here are some examples from literature: I believe not, replied my uncle Toby, after some pause\u2014for being inland, as I said, and having Silesia and Moravia to the east; Lusatia and Upper Saxony to the north; Franconia to the west; and Bavaria to the south; Bohemia could not have been propell'd to the sea without ceasing to be Bohemia\u2014nor could the sea, on the other hand, have come up to Bohemia, without overflowing a great part of Germany, and destroying millions of unfortunate inhabitants who could make no defence against it (Laurence Sterne, Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman) The people of High Almain, they be rude and rusticall, and very boisterous in their speech, and humbly in their apparel .... they do feed grossly, and they will eat maggots as fast as we will eat comfits. (Andrew Boorde, Fyrst Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge, 1547) Note that Boorde used \u201cAlmain\u201d for Germany, from French \u201cAllemagne\u201d. \u201cAlmain\u201d was still in use in Shakespeare\u2019s time.

There was riding tensions between Austria and Prussia and many believed that the unification of Germany would happen but weren\u2019t sure who would do it. Prussia created a series of wars ending in the creation of the North German Confederation. Bismarck then provoked a war with France and won causing the last remaining German states excluding Austria and created the German empire. ",

            "answer_text": "Germans never gave up on the hope of re-unification. For West-Germany it was something they actively pursued. The East-German government never wanted any part of it. But of course the East German citizens hoped for re-unification. an important reason for this was the fact that families were split up when the wall came up. Of course there were political and economical reasons too. But the justification for it cam from the wish for family reunion. The East-german government sometimes allowed some citizens to travel to the west to visit family. These were usually faithful party-members, or people that could be pressured to come back. I remember the weather forecast of the German TV in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s.  Because the TV signal was still transmitted through the airwaves, they knew that many people in East-Germany could receive West-German tv. So the weather forecast always showed a weather map of all of the German area, including East Germany, But none of the other neighboring countries. Before that, they even showed the areas that were in Poland, which were German before the war.  ",
