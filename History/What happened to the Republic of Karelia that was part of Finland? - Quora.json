            "answer_text": "What happened to the Republic of Karelia that was part of Finland? Did Russia seize that too, like Crimea?  Though I do understand that this loaded question is not sincere one but is another failed anti-russian rant, I\u2019ll answer it anyways\u2026 Crimea was incorporated into Russia as a result of referendum at the moment when violent UnConstitutional coup in Kiev left no other options for legal Crimean authorities then to rely to direct democracy and to ask Crimeans wether they wanted to accept results of UnConstitutional coup or would prefer reUnification with Russia\u2026 Nothing of that kind ever happened in Finland or Karelia - Karelia was not a part of Finland at the moment when Finland got independance in 1917 though small part of it was - but main Karelian territory was in Russia\u2026 After ww2 in which Finland was fighting on German side against Soviets Union and Great Britain[and against halph of the world because Australia, Canada and New Zealand for example were also at war against Finland] and so because Finland was defeated ally of Nazi Germany, the small part of finnish Karelia was attached to Soviet Union as a result of post-war demarkation of a border that ofcource took into account the fact that as a defeated ally of Nazi Germany Finland had to \u2018pay\u2019 for that with some contribution - both in money and in land - it was normality according to International law and was again attested in 1975 in Helsinky Accords as a result of UN International Conference on Security and International Order in Europe [those accords were later violated by USA and NATO in Yugoslavia and Kosovo]. So today the only fact that Russians feel as a bitter reality is the fact that because Finland in general has 2\u20133 times bigger gdp per capita [as compared to Russia] the general looks of Karelian cities in Russian Federation are worse then it would have been if those were in Finland.. Russian municipalities and the state have not enough resorses for maintanence at the same level as Finnish cities enjoy. Also in Finland the burden of renovations was traditionally on the owners while in Russia those were municipalities with their scarce resources that had to ensure good looks of everything in the city..Yet if you look at the tendency and compare the looks of finnish vs. soviet karelian cities in 1970-s or 1980-s - you would realise that a considerable progress has been achieved by Russians since those days, and though it is still far from finnish perfection the karelian cities start to look better\u2026 Here is the capital of the Karelian republic of Russian Federation: Petrozavodsk:  / / / ",

            "answer_text": "The Republic of Karelia never was a part of Finland. It is a governmental body that was created at the Soviet era in the USSR. Of course, there were other govermental intitutions before that.  Republic of Karelia - Wikipedia Here you can see the parts of Karelia that used to belong to Finland but were ceded to Russia after WW2. They are those lighter purple areas. Part of the area was joined to the Republic of Karelia and part was joined to other governmental areas in the USSR:  Karjala \u2013 Wikipedia Here is the Eastern border of Sweden at its largest. You could say that large parts of Karelia was part of Finland - but whole Finland was part of Sweden, so it would be historically a bit inaccurate:  Suomen rajamuutokset \u2013 Wikipedia So what happened to the Republic of Karelia? Nothing much, because it is still there, where the USSR established it (of course there has happened a lot, but not regarding its borders).What happened to the whole Karelia as a historical region is a bit different question. It has always been divided between the Western and Eastern influence and the exact border of that influence has been going to and fro. Today the old Karelian area is divided between FInland and Russia and in these countries further divided to different regions. ",
