            "answer_text": " He is considered one of the best, if not the best Roman Emperor who ever lived. He could even be called the greatest leader of all time. Theres just too many things to name but I will give you several reasons. First off, Augustus was considered brilliant- possibly even to have possessed genius level intellect - a master of politics and manipulation. Augustus started the Roman Empire as the first Emperor, but convinced everyone he wasnt one. He made himself \u201cfirst citizen\u201d so the senators didnt assassinate him like they assassinated his uncle Gaius Julius Caesar (they thought he was trying to become king- which was completely against republic law for there to ever be one again.)To everyone else, the people and the senate believe they were still in a Roman Republic, but in reality they were in an Empire under Augustus.Thats pretty damn impressive if you ask me. Any man who can fool a entire republic into becoming an empire without anyone the wiser has to be damn good.Before him, Rome was very corrupt. Senators had all the wealth, Slaves had all the work.The patricians only cared about keeping themselves rich and in power while the plebeians suffered. Julius Caesar wanted this changed. Augustus continued with much of his policies. Is it it better to have 1 single tyrant or a 100 tyrannical senators? Unlike the Republic that was very aggressive in its desire for expansion ,his policies led to 2 centuries of relative peace- aka Pax Romana.Pax Romana was state of comparative tranquillity throughout the Mediterranean world from the reign of Augustus (27 BC\u201314 AD) to the reign of Marcus Aurelius (161 \u2013180 AD).Augustus laid the foundation for this period of concord, which also extended to North Africa and Persia. The financial reforms of Augustus played a critical role on the subsequent success of the Roman Empire. He imposed consistent, direct taxation on the provinces in the empire. There were two main direct taxes: a poll tax and a land tax). Augustus Caesar\u2019s financial system was far more effective than any implemented in the empire before. It greatly increased Rome\u2019s net revenue and established a stable relationship between Rome and its provinces. Numerous building projects were undertaken during the reign of Augustus. The network of roads was expanded with a number of well-built roads leading to enhanced trade. Aqueducts were built and repaired, Many temples were built. He was born into a city that was brick and when it died it was all made of marble. He built a state run courier service based on relay stations\u2026 basically the worlds first postal service! Augustus instituted a new fire-fighting force in Rome called Vigiles Urbani (Watchmen of the City) \u2026. where the term vigilante comes from. Apart from combating the fires, which were a common problem , it also acted as a night watch and maintained order in the streets. Vigiles was complimented by Rome\u2019s first institutionalized police force known as Cohortes Urbanae (urban cohorts). While the Vigiles performed the day-to-day role of policing the streets and protecting against fires, the urban cohorts acted as a heavy duty police force, capable of riot control duties. He wasnt perfect and like all Romans back then, he could be brutal ( but this was before Judeo-Christian ethics), but I dont think Rome couldnt have asked for a better leader. ",

            "answer_text": "Most Roman historians, including myself, would place him at the very top. Some may place him 2nd or 3rd but almost everyone agrees he was the best.  His reign was a 40-year stint of economic prosperity, peace, strong diplomatic ties, grand building projects, and new reforms. His reign was stable. In the previous 60 years before he came to power, Rome suffered through around 5 civil wars and never-ending political violence. Augustus stabilized everything and for the 40 years he was in power there was peace, safety, and prosperity. He did not involve Rome in massive wars and his soft touch kept the political climate cold and calm.He created the first fire department, one of the first police forces, and improved the welfare given to the urban poor.He built grand monuments and financed gifted artistsHe created a stable administration that allowed Rome to effectively rule over their empire. Before Augustus provincial governors were cycled through every year or two and this led to instability. As soon as a governor was getting his bearings he was removed and some new guy had to start learning. Augustus created a stable bureaucratic network of provincial administrators that allowed each man to become an expert on their respective province.He expanded the borders just a bit so that they were secure. He used rivers, mountains, and other civilized empires as the borders so that they could be more secure.He conquered Egypt which added tons of grain and gold to RomeHe was able to incorporate Spain better. Spain had been under Roman control since the days of the 2nd Punic war in 200 BC, but the Spanish locals were not to thrilled about their Roman masters. Rome was boss in name only and the various peoples of Spain were fiercely independent. He went to Spain and pacified the locals - adding it to Rome as a safe and stable province. The gold mines of Spain would finance the empire for many centuries to come.You could honestly list things forever. He just did so much. His reign was 40 years long, which makes him the longest-ruling Roman Empire by a long shot. On average, Roman emperors ruled for around 7 years, and Augustus ruled for much longer. He was able to rule for this long because of how brilliant he was. For instance: he ruled from the shadows, not from a throne. Caesar had ruled out in the open and it got him assassinated. Augustus was very sneaky about how he ran things. He never interfered with the Senate or elections publically and quietly made it known how he expected votes in the Senate to turn out. On the surface, it appeared that the Republic was very much alive and he went to great lengths to stay out of the Senate\u2019s way. The Senators felt respected and empowered, the people felt safe, and legions were well paid: everyone was happy. Augustus also surrounded himself with the best people. He had rockstars like Marcus Agrippa: All-star general and top tier administrator. He defeated Sextus Pompey, Marc Antony, the Spanish tribes, and so many more. He was as brilliant as Augustus, but where Augustus was a political genius who lacked military ability Agrippa was a military genius who lacked political ability. Augustus could send him away with legions and know that he would not only win, but more importantly, remain loyal after winning. Drusus: This guy kicked the Germans around something fierce. He was a brilliant general and defeated the same army that destroyed 3 Roman legions in the Teutoburg forest. Gaius Maecenas: This guy was the opposite of Agrippa but was an important part of the \u201cimperial trio\u201d. Where Agrippa won wars and Augustus won politics, Maecenas won propaganda. He was a creative type and was responsible for the many great pieces of art commission by Augustus. He was not the artist himself, but instead, worked with a network of capable sculptors, writers, and painters, and commissioned them to not only create great works but to make them effective propaganda. In addition, he was a great political advisor that was calm and calculating.Augustus was a great delegator and a loyal friend. His loyal charming nature and loyalty earned him the love of these great men. It goes a long way to have powerful and capable friends and Augustus had them in spades. Last unrelated note: I just started a YouTube channel. While I am still learning, I just published a video on Augustus\u2019s early life and it goes into a lot of detail.
