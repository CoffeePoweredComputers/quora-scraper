            "answer_text": "As far as cities go, I'll not fully address that, as it would be a lengthy list. But, San Diego, and San Bernardino, in California are fairly conservative. Major cities in other blue states, I am unfamiliar with to the extent that I could label them conservative or not. But, major cities in Red states, obviously would tend to make one believe that they are pretty conservative. As for states, let's start with what appears to be the reddest of red states, my home state of Oklahoma. Not a single County went for the Democrat presidential candidate in the last several election cycles. Traditionally, at least over the last several years, we have had all statewide offices on both the state and federal levels, held by republicans. Until I think it was six years ago, we traditionally had one Democrat member of the U.S. House of Representatives. But, even OK2 eventually flipped to the republicans. So, I'd say that even though Oklahoma is a plurality Democrat state, those democrats vote pretty conservative, as most Republicans enjoy a pretty secure re-election campaign bid, when the time comes. As for the rest, let's stipulate about the Deep South, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas (although Arkansas is the most recent defector, it has become one of the most solid red states). Kentucky, North Carolina, Florida and Louisiana, are pretty conservative, but can lean towards being somewhat \"purple\" in their politics. Utah. I think in the last 3 presidential elections, only one county, one time, went for the Democrat. Wyoming. Same as Utah. Of the last three elections, one county, one time, went for the Democrat. That's the County around Jackson Hole. Idaho. Solid conservative state. North Dakota. Solid conservative state. Alaska, is fairly solidly Red, but with a large contingent of their population, leaning toward Democrats. South Dakota. Conservatively libertarian, in its leanings. Arizona, Texas, Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri, Indiana, seem more conservative than they are, politically, and can be fairly purple in nature, especially with the influx of people escaping the far leftist states like CA, OR, WA, IL, IA, WI, & MN. Some may want to argue about TX and AZ, but they really are seeing a huge influx of people from the left coast, and that is affecting the voting base in those states. Eventually, they will become solidly \"Purple\". Then, you have the truly purple \"Swing States\" like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and as I mentioned, North Carolina and Florida. The rest, while having sizable parts of their states which may be solidly conservative (New York, California, Virginia, West Virginia), are controlled by the left, regardless the party affiliation of whom they elect, which means that they are pretty much your solidly Blue, or Democrat controlled states, as I see it.

            "answer_text": "When it comes to the likelihood of people to self-identify as \"conservative,\" User-12240670416701737268's answer (Alabama) is correct. But if you're talking about state policy or voting habits, the answer may be different. The largest population of Republican voters in any single county is in Maricopa County, Arizona, and Arizona has a very strong conservative bent to its politics. However, there are an awful lot of Arizona Democrats, too. Utah and Oklahoma have the fewest \"blue\" counties of any state (zero). Mitt Romney won Utah by a wider margin than any state in 2012, and Clinton came in 3rd in Utah (behind both Al Gore and Ross Perot) in his 1996 reelection. Utah is probably the most Republican state, proportionally speaking (and our only Democratic Representative to the House is a conservative Democrat). Texas is home to the largest population of registered Republicans. But conservatism and Republicanism are not exact synonyms. Those states should at least be in consideration, but they're not shoo-in winners. If you want to look at the issues:  Wyoming has the lowest abortion rate (by far!) and the highest gun ownership rate of any state.Utah, Alaska, and Arizona have the most lenient gun laws.Alaska has the lowest tax burden of any state.Folks from Mississippi go to church the most, followed by Alabama.Oklahoma has the harshest penalties for marijuana possession (though Texas sentences far more people to nearly as harsh penalties).Alabama passed America's harshest anti-illegal immigration law (though Arizona is a strong second).The Dakotas and Nebraska have the lowest unemployment rates (though North Dakota's unemployment figure is a little undependable because they have a HUGE seasonal migration of workers that mess with the statistics, since they work in-state but officially live out-of-state).I'm sure there are other ideological factors that could be measured as well, but this gives you an idea of the competition. Overall, the ultimate winner of the title \"Most Conservative State\" really depends on how you measure conservatism. ",
