            "answer_text": "Individualism is the value system that gives primacy to \u2018self\u2019 as the smallest indivisible unit of \u2018conditional\u2019, efficacious life. The point at issue here is that: Life is conditional - you have to work on itLife is hard - you have to work on it. It takes skills. It is not automatic or self-evident for humans. Humans cannot simply \u2018eat grass\u2019. It takes work, organisation and intelligence.Human life is social - so it demands abstract principles to relate to others; and by principles I mean \u2018principles to ascertain what is whose\u2019, and \u2018who did what\u2019 to earn any value. Just because \u2018life is social\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean \u2018individual life is subordinate to the group, or \u2018society has primacy\u2019 as the sociology school of thought supposes.Values are scarce for humans - Our ability to abstract means that \u2018we can create immense value and \u2018transformative states of being\u2019 far removed from the manner in which animals live. People think \u2018humans are animals\u2019, and it is true humans can function at \u2018the level of animals\u2019. But humans also have the discretion to \u2018rise above animals\u2019, which takes humans to a higher level of being. As high as god, you might ask? Actually higher. The bible is full of contradictions. It is the words of flawed men. Men can go higher.Values are contingent and contextual. There is no such thing as \u2018a social value\u2019. No sooner has one expressed \u2018a collective value\u2019, and one has succumb to a dogma, because values are inherently personal because the interpreter of values is personal. Even for conjoined twins, sharing a body with two heads. They are no less \u2018two persons\u2019, two individuals forced to share a bedroom by their nature, lest science finds a way for them to part. How\u2019s that for context!",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s because the flourishing of individuals requires the development of the individual\u2019s ability to reason \u2014 that is, to understand the facts of reality as they pertain to their interests and well being \u2014 and so to engage in rational self-direction and self-determination. In short, we need individualism to mature as adults and to pursue happiness. Otherwise, you end up with a society of childish adults who are fit only to be led and to be slaves of whatever supremely privileged people are in charge. ",
