            "answer_text": "Absolutely pivotal.  In the normal process of things, when an Emperor died, two or more of the ruling family would gather their armies and have a short, sharp civil war.  This would usually be over in a year or two, since all parties wanted to get it over with as quickly as possible, so there was no medieval manoeuvring back and forth, spending years taking a hundred miles of ground etc.  Far better to take the Anglo-Saxon approach - everyone meet up on a convenient patch of ground, kill everybody, last one standing wins.  Then the new Emperor would reign supreme and all of the fighting would be outward facing, kicking Johnny Foreigner - an approach which all right-thinking Romans could get right alongside.  Then the Emperor would die and there would be another Civil War. Then the 3rd Century happened.  During this period Emperors faced constant challenges to their rule from relatives and generals who were not content doing the decent thing and waiting for an empty throne to launch their bid for power.  Instead there was more or less a hundred years of civil war, with armies all over the empire declaring for their general and marching against each other.  No sooner had a victor emerged and seized power when another claimant with an army would emerge, and quite often more than one at any given time. Not only did this allow barbarians to nibble at the edges of the empire without much retaliation, it ruined the Roman army.  The army that emerged at the end of the 3rd Century bore little resemblance to the classic legions of the Principate.  No lorica segmentata armour, scutum or gladius.  The Roman 'legionary' now carried an oval shield, wore chainmail, carried a longer sword and spear and fought in a looser formation.  Cavalry was a much more crucial part of the army than heavy infantry, and formations such as armies and legions were far smaller than they had been.  These armies were still better than their barbarian rivals, but not by the margin that they had been.  More and more they came to resemble barbarian armies, and by the fifth century it was fairly common for Roman armies to actually be barbarian tribes, hired to fight for Rome in an effort to not only reduce the financial burden of maintaining armies, but also to get rid of two threats to Rome by arranging for them to fight each other. This all came about because there was no downtime in the 3rd Century to rest, re-equip and reinforce the army.  In the past, any war, civil or otherwise, would be followed by a period of peace which allowed the army to rest the legions, repair equipment and crucially, replace the men now pushing up grass.  Given that for a hundred years the legions had marched from one battlefield to another with no respite, the fourth century saw a Roman army that was a shadow of its former self. The anarchy hurt the economy and decentralised control significantly in the empire.  It would take exceptional individuals to rule a united empire from that point, such as Constantine and Diocletian, and while Rome was never in any danger of being conquered by external enemies, the rot had already set in in the West.

            "answer_text": "The Roman Empire was a federation of city-states run by local oligarchs, with the really wealthy in the few big cities drawing rents from across the empire. In parallel with this structure was the army, atop which sat the emperor. The wealthy did not run the army (or serve in it); the army back-stopped the oligarchs and kept the barbarians out. So generals were either of modest provincial senatorial families (Hadrian, Trajan, Severus) or gifted peasants. There was no formal rule of succession, although the army and the emperor both liked hereditary claims - hence the many short \u201cdynasties\u201d. A civil war every so often turned the wealth over and reinforced the dual army-oligarch rule. Too frequent civil wars, coupled with rising barbarian threats, undermined the whole thing. Paying victorious troops off plus barbarian raids meant taxes, meant withdrawal and resistance from the wealthy, meant peasant flight, meant locals oligarchs looking elsewhere for protection. Oddly enough, the most devoted defenders of the system were barbarian soldiers who had been drafted in and risen through the ranks, like Stilicho. And barbarian kings did not seek to displace Rome but to join her, but on their terms. ",
