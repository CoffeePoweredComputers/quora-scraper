            "answer_text": "Not our version of the Great Depression because it\u2019s a different, much more multifaceted set of problems and before it\u2019s under control, it has the potential to be much, much worse than anything we\u2019ve seen in this country including WWII. Here are several facts that give me this deeply disturbing impression: Right now, even though they have been promised,are eagerly anticipated, and said to be right around the corner, the fact remains that we do not have an effective, safe and widely available Covid vaccine. Just like the AIDS vaccine we have been chasing for 40 years, a COVID-19 vaccine does not yet exist;In a recent poll, 49% of Americans said they would not get vaccinated even if a COVID-19 vaccine was available;It takes somewhere between 60% and 70%, perhaps more, of a population to be either vaccinated, or infected with a virus and then immune, to reach \u201cherd immunity\u201d;The antibodies found in COVID-19 survivors are lasting only two to three months, so even infected people are not permanently immune, secondary infections are already occurring, and reaching any kind of naturally occuring herd immunity could be impossible;Approximately 47% of Americans refuse to wear face covering masks or to take other precautions designed to slow the viral spread; andWe have a madman at the helm who\u2019s now employed a modern, medical Rasputin to preach the insanity of dropping our guard completely and going for herd immunity by doing nothing.Even if everything goes as well as many of us are hoping and a vaccine is available by the middle of next year, there will be more than a quarter of a million dead Americans by the time Trump\u2019s first term ends in January. If Trump gets re-elected and there is any delay in the availability of a viable vaccine, he will kill somewhere between two and three more million of our countrymen if allowed to pursue herd immunity without the benefit of a vaccine. While not probable, every one of these things going wrong is certainly possible. In order to make sure that we avoid the worse case scenario, the only one we can control for sure is to be certain that Donald Trump does not get another four years to ruin what\u2019s left of the United States.

            "answer_text": "Will the Covid-19 outbreak and the overall craziness of 2020 be remembered as our generation\u2019s version of The Great Depression? My short answer is no, it is not as big a story. However, I do remember telling my father that this pandemic would be the biggest story of my lifetime. He lived through the Depression, and was therefore entitled to tell me to hold his beer. I believed that early on because I knew that it was going to be politicized, and therefore weaponized. I was not wrong about that. But what makes this story smaller in comparison with the Great Depression are several differences: The government was slow to act in the Great Depression, and then extended the pain in a variety of ways. There was little or no safety net in place then, so when unemployment went to 25% and above, people were living in tents, under bridges, and standing in line for food. This pandemic has caused a huge disruption in our lives, but there is a safety net catching a lot of the fallout, and there is a known endpoint, specifically when a vaccine is found. At that point, there is no reason that things can\u2019t get back to normal. There will be some long term damage done to some segments of the economy, but states are opening up, unemployment is falling, and the death rate is falling at the same time.In this pandemic, there have been spot shortages of toilet paper, maybe a few food items, but the people that produce products for us have done a tremendous job. They should rank up there with the healthcare workers who have put themselves in peril to keep things going.The other craziness of 2020, the civil unrest, pales in comparison to the entire decade of the 1960\u2019s. Specifically 1968 was a terrible year after the assassination of Martin Luther King. Hundreds of people were killed in rioting, and many neighborhoods destroyed, never to be rebuilt.However, 2020 should be remembered for the politicization of the virus. From the right, an opportunity to blame China, and attempt to use it to reduce trade with that country. From the left, an opportunity to blame the Trump administration, and to encourage people to accept a much larger national government response. It isn\u2019t over yet, but the Covid-19 pandemic is very likely going to be much less costly in human lives than the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918. It could have been as bad, based on the Pandemic Severity Assessment Framework. So overall, we have managed it better than we could have. We have seen unemployment start to tick down, very rapidly in some states. The two things have to be looked at together. ",
