            "answer_text": "No. But neither Puzo nor the Don cared about such things. Hagen was consigliere which in Puzo\u2019s creation was even more important than underboss. After Hagen is made consigliere he learns that the other families derisively start referring to the Corleones as the \u201cIrish gang\u201d. And IIRC in the Five Families meeting Puzo tells us the other family bosses consider the Don\u2019s elevation of Hagen to be a rare act of foolishness. Earlier Solozzo tells Hagen that people were dismissive of Hagen because he wasn\u2019t even Italian much less Sicilian. These reactions let Hagen know he could never hope to be boss. But he never wanted anything more than to be the Don\u2019s or Sonny\u2019s right hand man. The Don approvingly tells Hagen \u201cEven though you\u2019re not a Sicilian I made you one.\u201d In real life there were a few Italian dominated crime organizations that didn\u2019t always have the made man distinction-the early incarnation of the Chicago Outfit was one. Murray Humphreys was possibly an analogue to the fictional Hagen. ",

            "answer_text": "No, Tom Hagen was not a made man.The reason: because he was of German-Irish ancestry and as is made clear Scorsese's mafia film Goodfellas, one needs to be a hundred per cent Sicilian to be a made man (\"Me and Jimmy could never be made because of our Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian, because they had to be able to track all our relatives back to the old country.\" - Henry Hill, Goodfellas). So, seeing that The Godfather takes place in the same mafia universe, we can be safe in assuming Tom Hagen can never be made. As established in the film, Hagem was just an orphan kid living on the streets and befriended by Santino, whom the Don later takes in under his wing and grows up to be a key asset to the Corleone family (this is established in the scene where Virgil Sollozzo compliments Hagen upon learning that the latter had deduced that Solozzo had already made a deal with the Tattaglias).
