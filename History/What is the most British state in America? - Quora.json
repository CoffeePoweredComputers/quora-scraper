            "answer_text": "As far as national states are concerned, I'd go with Canada, although several West Indian countries are most British in culture. As far as states and provinces within countries or national states, I'd say Newfoundland & Labrador followed by Utah, Maine and Prince Edward Island. Some provences in Canada may be distinctly Scottish (e.g. Nova Scotia for culture, Prince Edward Island by descent) and several, such as British Columbia, have tried to sell themselves on their britishness. Also worth mention are such southern USA states as those in northern New England (i.e. Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine) and mormon USA states such as Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho. As far as the old stock British are concerned, they are dominant in much of the south and Appalachia in such states of the USA as Kentucky, Arkansas, possibly West Virginia, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia (still culturally British in several ways in the case of the last one mentioned) et al.

See the pink areas for Great Britain.  Worthy of mention: this map generally splits those of British ancestry into the English, Scottish, Manx, Welsh, Scots-Irish et al, as well as the many millions who respond as being of \u201cAmerican\u201d descent (and are overwhelming of British descent) \u2014  ",

            "answer_text": "I definitely second New England. I lived there for 4 years, in the rural beauty of western Massachusetts. I\u2019ve also lived in England for about 1 year. There\u2019s obviously the geography\u2014New England has quite some very English names for place names. They even have the weird English tendency to spell and sound quite differently. There\u2019s Worcester, Haverhill, Scituate, Leominster, Cochituate, Gloucester, etc. But it\u2019s also the culture. New Englanders tend to be quiet, not very expressive and keep to themselves a lot of the time. They can sometimes be cold. They\u2019re not voluble, chatty people, unlike most Americans. They\u2019re very much like the English themselves\u2014who are also quiet, not very expressive, keep to themselves a lot of the time and can sometimes be cold. And if I go by whenever the Red Sox won the World Series, like the English, New Englanders can suddenly transform themselves into a rowdy, violent bunch when they get drunk and their favorite team wins some type of tournament. LOL. (Though on average New Englanders can hold their liquor better than the original English. Sloppy drinking in public is definitely something that is frowned upon in New England but that is very much tolerated in old England.) [EDIT: I just thought about it and I\u2019m describing only western Massachusetts here. I\u2019d imagine that Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine are the same way. I\u2019ve met a lot of Mainers and two Vermonters, and they were all quiet, not very expressive and incredibly self-effacing, like the English.] ",
