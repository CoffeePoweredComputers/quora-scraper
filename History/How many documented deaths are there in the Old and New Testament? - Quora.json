Perhaps 5 ot 10 million. But it doesn\u2019t understand itself as a question. These questions help focus on the question a little more directly: Why did those deaths occur?What is God\u2019s role in the world?Is all violence bad? Is there such a thing as Righteous violence for the justice or good of humility?",
