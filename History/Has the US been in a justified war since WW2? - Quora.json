Say what you will about how it was executed and the underlying motives, but the first Gulf War in 1991 also constituted an intervention to preserve the sovereignty of another nation, so\u2026 Tardily and lamely intervening to stop attempted genocide in the former Yugoslav states counts. And Afghanistan in 2001 leaps to mind. Now, in all cases, execution fell short of what could be desired, and muddy policy gummed up (and/or outright caused) every single one of them, but\u2026 And these are merely the ones where my jaded and cynical eye sees justification- in some cases decades after the fact. Make no mistake, we\u2019re a warlike nation, and we spend entirely too much time dropping bombs on people continents away, but\u2026 let us not oversell the malice underpinning those actions. ",

I think stopping the Communists in Korea was noble, we fought to attempt to resolve a war in Vietnam, stopped Saddam Hussein because he was raping a neighbor and then finished the job while getting rid of people who murdered civilians by the thousand. that all sounds justifiable or not. I would prefer there be no war but nations, especially big ones, can get entangled. ",
