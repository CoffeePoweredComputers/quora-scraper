            "answer_text": "Mughal who came under the flag of Babar was consist of afghan, Tajiks, and white Turks( lesser mongoloid , high R1a1) and all these people started to claim themselves mughals. such phenomena always prevail in India for example upper caste like bhumihar when converted to islam taking identity of kamsari pathans. It should be noted that white Turks were not new to India because their previous ancestors were also warlords of India i.e. white Turks were descendents of synthians, Huns, kushans , parthanias, yuchis etc , later they got converted to islam and became ujbeks, Turks , tajiks,kyrgyz. Indeed they are warrior by genetics that's why they had capability to defeat kashtriyas. Now at present the mughal communtiy has become the part of Ashraf ( general) communtiy of indian muslims. The sunni ashraf (general) communtiy including muslim Rajpoots and Shia Ashraf is nearly above 30 percent of total muslim population.jjjb  Don't get confused when you see a dark skin pathan or shaikh or Mirza, now a days who converted from occupational caste also calim them irani or Arab for example Ansari julaha convert call them Arab but they don't look like them , and same for neelgar, pinjara, dhuniya, Kasai, etc. They are just converted from Hindu artisan groups and just want to uplift them but their genetics tells truth and it's apparent from their faces. These CONVERTED muslims are in majority about 65 percent of total muslim population. They always feel very jealous of mughals, syeds etc. But they should respect their ancestors who were converted from hindus it will be tribute for them.jjj the real pathans or mughals are even more fairer than kashmeeri and you can easily saw them when you go muslims majority areas like ajmer , tonk, Bhopal, Rohillakhand, heydrabad, sasaram junagad,kishanganj, Saharan pur, sare tareen, amroha , bijnor, khandesh etc you will get surprised and probably most of you already got suprised by seeing extremely beautiful Muslims girl of these communtiy and Sam for the boys of our community.h ",

            "answer_text": "Most answers here talk about zafars sons etc. Not many are aware that the Mughal line was recognised and continued right till 1947 independence of India. After the mutiny in 1857 zafar was deposed but his cousin was recognised as the heir. Please bear in mind that every Mughal emperor had dozens of children and there fore there was always a next in line. The Mughal head was always recognised by the government of India ( British govt Which had taken over from east India company after 1857). the Mughal king recieved a pension from government and one even studied at Mayo college Ajmer where all kings studied. in 1947 the representative of the Mughal house mirza khair ud din went to newly formed Pakistan where he died in 1970s his eldest son was mirza shah rukh. Sultana begum can claim what she wants to the media but neither is the time line matching of her ancestor being smuggled to India from Burma neither does the story make sense. Zafar was imprisoned in Rangoon so surely him having a child at age 80 would be documented in British prison records. Whether right or wrong no one can accuse the british of not doing paperwork. Coming back to the current whereabouts, shah rukh didn't have a son but his brother did and they are the current heads of the Mughal dynasty. Indians should ask their government about why the part about imprisoning zafar is taught in schools but why not about the next in line getting the recognition and pension till 1947 and their leaving for Pakistan ",

            "answer_text": "Fact 1: Mughals is the corrupt word for Mongols. Fact 2: Khan became the most sought after surname after Kublai Khan, the Grandson of Temujin (Popularly known as Genghis Khan, The Khagan or Khan of Khans). The advent of Babur, his followers and thousands of harem gave rise to lots of Mongols, where in Hindustani we pronounce it as Mogols. Fact 3: In 2003, a ground breaking historical genetics study was conducted to prove that 1 in 200 men in the world are direct descendent of Genghis Khan, this is the reason why we often come across chinky looking Muslims who are locals speaking Pashtun, Afghani, Kyrgiz, Gilgiti, Baluchi, Dongri, Kashmiri, Punjabi,  who have spread across The North Western Neighbours of India to North Eastern India. Fact 4: Mongols was a derogatory word for the Arabs, since the Mongols was not only barbaric, they also butchered the sheikhs, mullahs and the ruling noble families like a game in Iraq and Iran. The very word Mongol or Khan was a terror word for Muslims earlier and there are hundreds of instances where the ruling elite have committed suicide when the Khan have attacked their kingdom. The Babur\u2019s Heirs In India Where We Loosely Call Them As Mughals Technically Became Insignificant After Aurangzeb\u2019s Death. Whatever Advantage The Islamic Army and The Mughals Had After The Third Battle Of Panipat With Marathas Diluted Into Oblivion With Family Feuds, Sibling Quarrels and Fighting With Local Satraps. ",
