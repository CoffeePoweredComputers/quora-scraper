            "answer_text": "There are n number of reasons for my belief in the lord Jesus Christ, as I assume you consider him as the Christian God. First reason, obviously I have tried him and I know he guides me personally with his words that he has spoken in the Bible. Secondly, I've been miraculously healed from a terrible stomach pain in the name of Jesus Christ. And, Most importantly, I believe in him after a complete study on his death and his resurrection. Certain facts have convinced me that the Christian faith is indeed true. Listing them here - Fact no. 1 - There are n number of references (biblical as well as non biblical references) which state that Jesus was indeed crucified under Pontius Pilate. One major claim from Islam is that Jesus was not crucified, and in fact Allah imitated someone else in the place of Jesus and it was that someone else who was crucified instead. This is indeed wrong in many ways - If someone else died instead of Jesus, where is the body of that someone else? The tomb is still empty where Jesus was laid, even today. Fact no. 2 - What happened to the disciples of Jesus, what made them so brave and courageous that they came out from hiding and they were willing to die an excruciating death proclaiming the Gospel all over the world? What changed them if it was not the resurrection of Jesus? The life and death of the disciples of Jesus Christ prove that they indeed saw him alive after his death. If we have to refuse the claims from the life of the disciples, we should only conclude that Jesus was a complete failure and he had a bunch of idiots with him - who could not even carry the Gospel correctly. Fact no. 3 - What changed Saul to Paul? How did a person who was killing Christians become a Christian and served His life for Christ? What gave that miraculous supernatural change in Saul if it was not the death and resurrection of Christ? It\u2019s not just Paul, we can also question the same with James, who was the skeptic brother of Jesus. Fact no. 4 - Lastly, what about the groups and groups of eyewitnesses, who saw the resurrected Jesus and wrote the gospels? They saw him literally! It was not just one person's imagination, hallucinations don\u2019t work that way. Jesus came in front of them after rising up from death, physically - and publicly. Further to the above facts, we also have a physical evidence for the resurrection, which is the Shroud of Turin. A detailed study on this shroud is explained in this documentary from History channel -  All these evidences and careful studies convinced me that the Christian faith is indeed true. All the best in your search for Truth! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I do. He is the only God there is. If you look at gods described by non-Christians, they cannot come up to scratch. The Christian God is a living God. He is one of omnipotence, omniscience, glory, and majesty. He is a super-intelligent being, who created everything natural in the universe and who created us each one, unique beings. Not only did He create thousands upon thousands of highly complex items in nature and complex plants, insects, animals and man, He is a God who wishes to relate to each one of His created human beings, individually. He has infinite time and interest in each one of us, and He knows us far better than we know ourselves. He loves us dearly.Because He is an awesome, holy God, He does not countenance a speck of sinfulness anywhere near Him. For this reason, in order that we may approach Him and enter a special Father/child relationship with Him, someone had to pay the price of our sin. It had to be someone without sin. So Jesus, the Second Person of the Trinity, not only came to earth to live here as a person, to set us an example of how to live properly in the world, showing us what God is like; He also took our sins upon Him and died a vicious, cruel death to pay that cosmic debt of sin. This means that, should we wish to respond to God's invitation to become His special children, we have to accept Christ (who is with God, and who is God) as our Saviour. We have been given free will. We can choose to worship God; and this is a good idea. He offers us a better life here - not necessarily materially speaking, not at all - and the certain hope of eternal life with our Father once we leave this world. You can't get a better offer than this one. No other God worshipped by non-Christians is believed to relate to us personally. No other God has come to earth and lived and died to make a way for us to live with Him in the next life. No other god is living and working in the world, as the Christian God is. Praise His name. He lives. So will I. So can you! It's a choice. ",
