            "answer_text": "Perhaps this person is mysterious for a reason. They may like it that way. On the other hand they may appear mysterious but are really just shy. In either hand I would proceed with caution. On the 1st what do you need another character in your life who likes being mysterious? On the other hand a shy person might welcome your interest. It seems to me from your question that you're more interested in the mysterious. Short of their being a psycho killer in hiding the mysterious person who likes it that way might enjoy the attention. That's probably the reason for the mystery. How do you get to know about them? Talk to them. Going any further in your research is intrusive to say the least, possibly illegal. ",
