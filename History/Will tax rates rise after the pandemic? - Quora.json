It is rarely seen that governments raising taxes to cover deficit spending, but we are no fortune-tellers, so there is a possibility for that when it comes to how big the deficit spending will be after this pandemic. People will most likely demand single-payer healthcare. Total Cost of Her COVID-19 Treatment: $34,927.43 This will result in more taxes. As economy is weakened, this will have more effect on people\u2019s lives. Government needs to be very careful in its actions now as they messed up everything when it came to containing the virus. Government can also raise taxes because there is a lot of money turning in economy and wants to collect it. They raise the price of goods and decreases the value of dollar. It is important to note that we can\u2019t know unless which candidate gets elected to office. If Trump stays, it will most likely stay same. If Biden comes, it will most likely go higher. ",

            "answer_text": "History provides some grounds for optimism as to what comes next. In times of war, governments have tended to make wealthier sections of the population and large businesses carry a larger share of the burden than before. In the First World War, for instance, both Britain and the United States imposed an 80 percent tax rate on excess corporate profits (above an 8% annual return,) and the top income tax rate on the highest earners rose from 15 percent to 77 percent. Something similar happened in the Second War, when top income tax rates rose to 94 percent. In the United Kindgom, the top income tax rate rose to an even more eye-watering 99.25%. Similar tax measures were adopted by other countries at war. Obviously this is based on the aftermath of war, but we are experiencing many of the same things in term of options as a citizen, so it would not be a long shot to make the estimates based on previous historic ground.
