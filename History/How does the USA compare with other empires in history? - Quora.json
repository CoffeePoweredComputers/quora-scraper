            "answer_text": "The common denominator with all empires down through the ages is their rise and inevitable fall, as evidenced by the rise and fall of the Egyptian, the Greek-Roman, the Islamic, the Habsburg and British empires taking us all the way up to the 1940s. Most historians tend to mark the end of the second world war in 1945 as the acute rise of the USA\u2019s global influence in so many fields including militarily where it has secured bases throughout the world, not to mention the extensive patrols of the open seas, which are characteristics that could easily deem the USA as an empire builder.[1]  In the period between 1945 and 2016 the USA took on the role of global leadership which is required of the dominant world empire. They lead the world in technology and innovation, military power, economic development, promotion of democracy, the maintenance of peace and world order, the development of codes of human decency and behavior and the fight for freedom and noble causes.  But like all empires before it, a fall inevitability follows the rise and a cursory look at the isolationist \u2018America First\u2019 policies of the current USA administration coupled with its attack on the free press, discrimination against certain religions, withdrawal from regional trade agreements and global security networks indicates to me that we may just be looking at the inevitable fall of what was once a great and mighty empire. But the USA\u2019s withdrawal from the world order just provides the opportunity for a new world power and empire builder to take their place \u2026 China?

            "answer_text": "Not very closely. The temptation to call the United States an empire is a natural one arising out of its global hegemony. But empire is more properly defined as a political organization which does not really match the structure of the United States. In terms of governance by coercion, there is a point to be had there in terms of economic arm-twisting, but the United States seldom uses military force to maintain control over the territory over which it asserts direct rule. I would consider this to be a key element of an empire. Because of modern technology, the United States possesses a historically unique ability to project power globally. Depending on your perspective it may be hard to acknowledge, but the US has more often than not exercised restraint in exercising that power. This is also an anti-pattern to the idea of empire. For anyone keeping score, I am not ignoring the United States history of expansion during the 19th Century: that certainly had an imperial feel to it. But the US quickly moved away from those ancient practices and did so largely prior to establishing its position as the global hegemon. tl;dr While the US is more powerful than the great empires of history, it is clearly something different in form and character.
