BUT ALSO, of course, face the fact that you were not going to find a \u201csuitable\u201d male mate, because many of the fit yourng men had just been slaughtered in the Flanders mud - more usually described as \u201csacrificed their lives in Flanders\u2019 field\u201d - which sounds better, somehow - greener, and with flowers and butterflies and the chirping of birds in the background: but \u2019twas a BATTLEfield - so your swain was \u201cmissing, believed killed\u201d or \u201cdied for King and country\u201d - and you were NOT going to find a husband of your own age/class/choosing. So, like my mother - born 1898 - you had to widen your search - she found my father - born 1871: old enough to be her father - already wed and the father of five children - and shack up with him \u201cin sin\u201d - because he had married a Roman Catholic, and they did not \u201cdo\u201d divorce, so all they had was a \u201cJudicial Separation\u201d - and remarriage was not possible. Tough. Oh well, how sad, too bad - so she got on with her life. As did all her sisters - only one of whom ever snagged a husband. ",

            "answer_text": "The 1920s flappers were the first liberated women. Flappers were college educated, had office jobs, were proudly flat chested (flaunting their breastlessness), showed their legs by wearing mini skirts (sometimes without panties), had very short hair, used profanity, used dildos and vibrators, were openly bisexual and lesbian, drank hard liquor, and smoked Marijuana. They also voted in elections, and elected progressives and socialists.  ",

A woman\u2019s chief duties there were probably quite different from those of an upper-class woman in, say, Tokyo - or of a lower-class worman in Mexico City. Your question is so badly formulated as to be nearly unanswerable. ",
