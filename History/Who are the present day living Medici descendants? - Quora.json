            "answer_text": "I feel what probably happened to the Medici's is similar to what happened to the Plantagenets. I am descended from the Plantagenets, at least, according to Ancestry.com. Yes, the Plantagenets are still out there, in a diminished stature. I don;t know if any use \u201cPlantagenet\u201d for their surname. It is a very interesting, and colorful family, but in the end, it means nothing beyond the honor. There are no practical benefits. Membership has to be enough. There is no fortune for me. That pot of gold, it turns out is a crock. I will not kick the Queen off the throne of England. Yes, I am descended from King Henry IV, but that was then, and this is now! The ship sailed a long time ago! In fact, you would never know any of this by looking at me. I live an ordinary life, my last name is not Plantagenet but Dodd, and I would have never known any this except for genealogical research. I feel LIKE an ordinary life because I have an ordinary life. In short, I am a face in the crowd, that you see on the sidewalk every day. I would imagine this truth is the same for the Medicis, or at least for the most part, of that clan, in this present day. Still some families, from the Middle Ages, still exist. The Grimaldis, the Rothschilds, and others are still around. Having Charlemagne in my background is a nice touch. Having the Sinclair family in my family tree, who built Roslyn Chapel (of Da Vinci Code fame), is nice, but let us be honest, of my personal history, I can claim no credit for the Chapel\u2019s construction, beyond my family ties, when the Da Vinci Code was in theaters, was not my doing. So what killed the Plantagenet clan? Answer: Plantagenet women. I am not blaming them, per se. The Plantagenets women were actually more successful than men. They married well, but it also forced the Plantagenet women\u2019s last name out of existence. They married well, took their husband\u2019s surname, and that was the end of that particular family line. What I am saying is that by Plantagenet woman married well, better than the Plantagenet men succeeded with a more checkered career in trade and government, the men effectively lost connections in medieval and renaissance society. They were no longer the movers and shakers, so they lost opportunities for moving and shaking. A self-fulfilling prophecy. They couldn\u2019t, so they didn\u2019t, so they couldn\u2019t; in a downward spiral. So the Plantagenet name was merged into other families. I'm my case, the Nesbit family, which merged into the Dodd family. I suspect all this is true for the Medici family, as well! ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to answer this question is to work backwards from the grand dukes of Tuscany\u2014the last powerful branch of the House of Medici. That would be: Cosimo I (r. 1537 - 1574), third cousin once removed of Alessandro\u00a0Francesco I (r. 1574 - 1587), son of Cosimo I\u00a0Ferdinando I (r. 1587 - 1609), son of Cosimo I\u00a0Cosimo II (r. 1609 - 1621), son of Ferdinando I \u00a0Ferdinando II (r. 1621 - 1670), son of Cosimo II\u00a0Cosimo III (r. 1670 - 1723), son of Ferdinando II\u00a0Gian Gastone (r. 1723 - 1737), son of Cosimo III\u00a0For each step, I\u2019m going to go over two meanings of the word \u2018descendants\u2019: 1) The set of legitimate male-line descendants of a given person (the \u2018House\u2019)\u2014which is actually very difficult to maintain in existence for more than a few centuries due to a statistical phenomenon known as the Galton\u2013Watson process, or \u2018surname extinction\u2019. This set includes only sons, sons of sons, sons of sons of sons, and sons of s sons, where s is the phrase \u2018sons of\u2019 repeated 1 or more times. Except in rare cases, these lines \u2018daughter out\u2019. This explains why there are only a few Y-chromosomal haplogroups, and why patrilineal dynasties like the Medici never keep their thrones forever. 2) The set of all genealogical descendants of a given person\u2014which either remains at 0 (the person has no children), trends toward 0 quickly (the person\u2019s children or grandchildren have no children), or expands exponentially, eventually including the entire population of the planet (see Identical ancestors point).  So, the Medici. The reason Gian Gastone was the last Medici ruler is because he was the last living legitimate male-line descendant of his great-great-great-grandfather Cosimo I. Gian Gastone had no children. His father Cosimo III had two others, besides Gian Gastone, but neither had children. Patrilineal descendants today: 0; Total descendants today: 0. Cosimo III\u2019s father Ferdinando II had one other child live to adulthood, besides Cosimo III. He had been a celibate cardinal, but was forced to leave the Church and marry when it became clear the Grand Ducal branch would become extinct. It didn\u2019t work. He had no children. Patrilineal descendants today: 0; Total descendants today: 0. Here\u2019s where it becomes necessary to distinguish the two types of \u2018descendant\u2019. Ferdinando II\u2019s father Cosimo II had two other children who lived to adulthood, but they were daughters. Margherita married the Duke of Parma and Piacenza; Anna married the Count of Tirol. Together, they have tens of thousands of living descendants today, including all of the Roman Catholic royal families of Europe\u2014but they are not patrilineal Medici. Patrilineal descendants today: 0; Total descendants today: about 40,000. That number just includes those in Leo van de Pas\u2019 database\u2014and not any branches genealogists lost track of. These are ~40,000 unique individuals; there are many more branches that repeat. Felipe VI of Spain, for instance, is descended from Cosimo I through over 250 routes thanks to cousin marriage. Cosimo II\u2019s father Ferdinando I had one other child live to adulthood\u2014Claudia, who married the Duke of Urbino, then the Count of Tirol. If that sounds familiar from the last paragraph, it\u2019s because of first cousin marriage. Claudia\u2019s son the Duke of Tirol married his first cousin Anna de\u2019 Medici. Claudia\u2019s daughter Vittoria della Rovere married her first cousin Ferdinando II de\u2019 Medici. Both have no descendants today, so the numbers remain the same. Patrilineal descendants today: 0; Total descendants today: about 40,000. That brings us to Cosimo I. His son Ferdinando I became Grand Duke because his older son Francesco I had no male heir, but he had many other descendants through his daughters Eleonora, Duchess of Mantua and the much more famous Marie de\u2019 Medici, Queen of France, wife of Henri IV and grandmother of the Stuart kings Charles II and James II. Because of those two kings\u2019 illegitimate children were ancestors of Princess Diana, Francesco is the latest Medici ruler who\u2019s an ancestor of a future British king. There are lots of repeats in these descendants, but many more new, through French and British lines. There are also additional Italian lines through Isabella de\u2019 Medici. Patrilineal descendants today: 0; Total descendants today: about 100,000. Again, those are just the traceable ones\u2014genetic descendants are likely more numerous. The reason why the list above begins with Cosimo I is that the Cafaggiolo branch (the Dukes of Florence) died out with Alessandro de Medici in 1537, so the leading men of Florence chose his unknown third cousin once removed as duke, mistakenly thinking Cosimo would be weak. So there are also no patrilineal descendants of Giovanni di Bicci de\u2019 Medici (1360\u20131429), the one who founded the Medici bank and the family\u2019s wealth and power. At this point, my computer program slows down and the databases are less complete, so I\u2019ll just estimate Giovanni\u2019s: \u201cpatrilineal descendants: 0, total descendants: 2.5 million, heavily concentrated in two sets\u2014European royal families and the noble and landowning classes of Tuscany and northern Italy. There are, however, patrilineal Medici from other branches. One, the Ottajano branch, argued that they should have inherited the Grand Duchy of Tuscany\u2014instead of the Duke of Lorraine, a non-patrilineal descendant. But that\u2019s not how Italian politics and pan-European succession wars worked by the 18th century. This patrilineage still exists today\u2014and there are others of both sure and unsure patrilineal affinity to the House of Medici. In any case, they aren\u2019t descended patrilineally from the wealthy, bank-founding Medici you\u2019re asking about. That family, we can conclude, has descendants in the low millions, but 0 in the male line. ",
