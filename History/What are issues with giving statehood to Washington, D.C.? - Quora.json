            "answer_text": "I think the primary issue is DC is primarily a Democrat strong hold. The issue is similar to the problem with admiting states before the Civil War - free and slave states needed to be admited at the same rate. That\u2019s why most proposals look for a way to also create a Republican equivalent, but those are forced too and not sure they really have any support beyond the theoretical party balance. But beyond that there are some significant logistal issues. DC is really a city and as such its not really big enough to take care of itself. If you look at other cities and states, as much as some might complain about how much they send out in tax dollars, states are their to support the cities when a crisis happens. You can look at how New York State provided support to New York City during Superstorm Sandy. Another big problem DC would have is it has a shrinking tax base from property. In addition to the Federal goverment that doesn\u2019t pay taxes there are a number of nonprofits (like universities) and non-governmentmental organizations and so on that don\u2019t pay taxes. Everytime one of them buys a building it goes off the tax rolls. There is also an ongoing issue of can DC really manage itself. Certainly there were long standing issues with Marion Barry. While some may be attributed to racism, Marion Barry\u2019s behavior and voter willingness to keep sending him back to office didn\u2019t inspire confidence in the people in Congress who could support independence In the time it has had limited self rule there have been numerous problems with the goverment and it\u2019s even had to have an appointed Financial Control Board. DC as a state has a lot going against it. Even if it has political approval that would be just the start of the struggle to be able to maintain it. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, first, a city is not a state. There are dozens of cities with more population than Washington DC, and they are not states. Secondly, the reason the district did not become a state in the first place, is that, as the capital of the nation, it could not be under the jurisdiction of a single state government. That being said, it is not right that residents do not have voting representation in Congress. Two obvious solutions are: 1. Make the delegate to Congress a voting representative (Norton currently has no voting power) and 2. Cede back as much of the district as possible, as was done to Virginia 200 years ago. These two actions would result in the majority of current district residents being part of Maryland again, with all the representation that other Marylanders enjoy, and would ensure all those still living within the district conclave would have representation.
