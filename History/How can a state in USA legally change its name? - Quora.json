            "answer_text": "A State can change its name by any mechanism that its electorate finds suitable. In most cases, it would require an amendment to the state's constitution, since the constitution usually sets forth the name of the state, but ultimately this is entirely a question of the law of that state. Upon a state deciding to change its name, it would notify the Archivist of the United States of the change of its name, and the federal government would thereby adjust its records to reflect the new name adopted.  The United States, so far as we know, cannot order a state to change its name or refuse to accept a change of name from a state. Things might get interesting if two states attempted to have the same name, but there's no provision currently that requires that each state have a name unique from that of all others. ",

The full name of the State now is \u201cRhode Island and Providence Plantations,\u201d and, guess what? Some people object to the \u201cplantations\u201d part even though they weren\u2019t plantations in the Southern sense. Not long ago there was a movement to rename North Dakota simply \u201cDakota.\u201d It would probably just take a resolution at the State level, maybe with a concurring resolution from Congress. ",
