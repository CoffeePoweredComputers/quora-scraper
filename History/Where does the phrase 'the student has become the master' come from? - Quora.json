            "answer_text": "This is one of those tricky phrases that has been recycled many times during the course of history, which as a result only serves to further obscure its true origins. The reason being that the proverb \u201ctakes on a life of its own\u201d and becomes a kind of myth or folklore in itself. Eg: I read it here\u2026 This author wrote it\u2026 This movie character said it\u2026 It was on this movie\u2026 This Philosopher first quoted it\u2026 It actually comes from this culture\u2026. etc\u2026 In this case I'm not really sure that \u201cthe student has become the master\u201d, is actually a direct representation of an original quote. Rather its possible that it is an interpretive conclusion to a proverb found in the 4th century traditional Chinese text, Tao Te Ching, which was reputedly authored by the Chinese Philosopher Lao Tzu. (Tao Te Ching, along with Zhuanghzi, another Traditional Chinese text, is considered to be the foundational texts for both religious and philosophical Taoism. Although the actual author and dating of these texts are still widely debated.) The original credited quote is interperted as follows: \u201cWhen the student is ready the teacher will appear. When the student is truly ready... The teacher will Disappear.\u201d The implication being that at the conclusion of the lessons, the teacher will have imparted the entirety of his knowledge to the student. Therefore the student no longer requires a teacher, but can continue to learn independently. Perhaps even one day becoming more knowledgeable than the teacher himself. (Some transcriptions of this quote replace \u201cStudent\u201d with \u201cPupil\u201d, whilst others replace \u201cTeacher\u201d with \u201cMaster\u201d and vice versa). Perhaps this might be a potential source. However it should be noted that the text wasn't translated into English until 1868, an estimated 2000 to 2200 years later, therefore there could be quite a lot of meaning lost in translation. Other possible notable variations (although I'm sure there could be many more) include: \u201cPoor is the pupil who does not surpass his master\u201d. Leonardo Da Vinci. \u201cIt is the greatest achievement of a teacher to enable his students to surpass him\u201d. John G. Kemeny. \u201cIt is commonly said that a teacher fails if he has not been surpassed by his students\u201d. Edmond H. Fischer. Not forgetting more popular culture references: \u201cNow I am the Master\u201d. Darth Vader. \u201cIt's evolution man. One day the student becomes the teacher\u201d. Big Sean. Regardless of its origin \u201cthe student has become the master\u201d is still as inspirational and relevant in modern philosophy as it was in history. Hopefully this is helpful, although I can't claim to be an expert by any means. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A - Thank you. The origins of this concept predate the philosopher Siddhartha Gautama, more commonly referred to as Buddha (450 BCE.) He is often attributed to being the originator of the Buddhist proverb: \u201cWhen the Student is ready, the teacher will appear. When the student is really ready, the teacher will disappear.\u201d Though the accuracy of this has been debated as a Fake Buddha Quote and attributed to a much later author, Mabel Collins. However, she may have published a modern book entitled \u201cLight on the Path\u201d sometime prior to 1885 that contained a similar phrase, she did not conceive the concept itself. In her book the phrase was written as \u201cFor when the disciple is ready the master is ready also.\u201d Similar constructs of this concept however have appeared in texts that can be found throughout history. In the third century, a Tibetan text by Longchen Rabjampa is noted as having \u201cWhen there is a subject [student] the teacher appears.\u201d In hermetic texts, some say originated in ancient Egypt, the same concept is presented. So, the actual origin of the full concept may be lost in antiquity and the original version may never be known for sure. The conceptual phrase is a fundamental basis of the buddhist teachings. One who seeks enlightenment is a student, one who has achieved it is a master. Of course, we could just say the origin, at least in modern terms is Anakin Skywalker or should we say Darth Vader.

            "answer_text": "In American mainstream culture, the concept first was introduced outside the Asian and Sinophile communities in the TV series Kung Fu. A bit orientalized and simplistic, but everything on TV is, isn\u2019t it?  It has echoes in martial arts prior to that, and up until recent Star Wars media and discussions (Lucas based his Jedi and Sith on martial arts orders). But the root concept is deep in Asian teaching \u2014 in Hindu tradition, \u201cGuru\u201d is literally \u201clight/dark\u201d \u2014 a person who shows the difference between things to the chela or student. But the goal of the guru is for the chela to recognize non-duality, that the light and darkness are interdependent and aspects of unity. So if the guru is successful, the chela also becomes the guru. My guru from my 20s is as familiar to me as my parents\u2019 voices when I confront a crisis. None of them are still alive. But all of them give me an excuse to be wiser than I think I am. I think, \u201cI can\u2019t be this smart, but what would dad or rinpoche do?\u201d If I can \u201csimulate\u201d that then I am that wise, but \u201cdelegating\u201d it protects one from egotism. In Christian tradition, we have WWJD? Who do you carry in your heart? It\u2019s the complete assimilation of the life of virtue that ideally brings the student to grow into a teacher. ",

            "answer_text": "I googled it and found that Darth Vader said something like it just before killing Obi-Wan-Kenobi. I have said something like it often when discussing student evaluations of teachers, which seen to me to be a form of insanity. If you\u2019re in school to learn things for the future, how do you know when, if, or how the teacher\u2019s lessons have worked? You don\u2019t until the future. Students and teachers in the 60\u2019s were bullied by students who didn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t, or wouldn\u2019t do the work needed to develop the skill needed for the future. They voted against teachers who assigned too much or gave hard exams. Universities instituted publish-or-perish policies and demanded high student evals. So what did most teachers do? Less teaching and higher grades, just to feed their families. People who did it the old way were in constant danger. I was one of them. Universities liked bringing in more students because it got them more money and more jobs for administrators, who didn\u2019t like teaching, anyway. If students got useless pieces of paper for their money, that was their lookout. There is a more positive way to view the comment. Good teachers have always seen themselves as \u201cprimus inter pares,\u201d first among equals. They hope for their students to become masters and pass on the knowledge and traditions. I expect some of the others will tell you that it was in China, Japan, India\u2026 In the west it\u2019 comes from Jerusalem and Athens, from rabbis and philosophers, the Talmud and \u201cThe Republic.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "This phrase comes from the buddhism belief that once a student has learned all there is to learn, then they will not need the teachings of the teacher. In the Bible, there is a scripture similar to the phrase. Hebrews 5:11-14 NIV We have much to say about this, but it is hard to make it clear to you because you no longer try to understand. [12] In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again. You need milk, not solid food! [13] Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness. [14] But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil. There is another scripture that tells us about Christ Jesus as our teacher and Master; but will not be above Him. Luke 6:40-Students are not greater than their teacher. But the student who is fully trained will become like the teacher. ",

The goal of every student is to honor his master by adding something to their shared craft by going beyond the master. An object demonstration of this is Edward Deming, who was taken as a master when he brought the science of mass production to Japan in the early years after World War II; since then Japan has gone beyond the master by becoming more efficient and more successful at mass production that its presumed master, the United States.

But because it is a universal truth, it is often repeated and restated in books like the Bible (John 14:12) and in films like Star Wars. Human mastery of our world is built on this principle: The student strives to learn from his master. The word \u201cstudy\u201d comes from the Latin meaning \u201cto strive\u201d. As he continues, he becomes a disciple, one who follows his master even deeper in order to understand fully what the master understands. The word \u201cdisciple\u201d probably comes from the Latin \u201cdis+capere\u201d, meaning to take apart, to analyze, in order to grasp the essence of what the master knows. Eventually, the disciple understands the core knowledge of his master and then he becomes the master and goes beyond, adding his life\u2019s insights and teaching his own students even more than his old master knew.

It is more fun to apply the statement to disciplines; for example Zen Buddhism is a constant learning for the student until hopefully the student reaches enlightenment. He has become a master. if you cannot achieve greatness then teach. Coaches must be very proud when their charges excel. An irrelevant but juicy alternative comes from an epigram by the Roman Poet Martial and I paraphrase: A mistreated slave achieves greatness and obtains his own slaves. An observer seeing the new master in turn mistreating slaves says \u2018methinks he forgets being a slave\u2019 a second observer responds \u2018methinks he remembers too much\u2019.

In western culture, the statement is associated particularly with Andrea del Verrocchio, an Italian painter and sculptor of the 15th century. His most famous pupil was the incomparable Leonardo da Vinci. The practice of that time was to have an apprentice work on a part of a painting that the master had undertaken; Verrocchio assigned Leonardo the addition of one of the angels in his 'Battesimo di Cristo' ('Baptism of Christ'). So far superior was Leonardo's portion of the painting that Verrocchio is said to have exclaimed, 'the student has surpassed the master!' \u2013 and to have given up painting from that day on. The 'Battesimo di Cristo' now hangs in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence. The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio and Leonardo) - Wikipedia ",

When the student is truly ready, the teacher will disappear.\u201d The interpretation has been debated. But some think that when the student is ready, the student actually becomes the teacher. This is a reflection of the idea that once students truly develop the proper experience, maturity and perspective, they are truly ready to learn and, in effect, start to train themselves. In martial arts movies and TV shows like Kung Fu, you may also see a slight twist on the idea. In these, the truly talented and hard working martial arts student may finally get to the point where he or she winds up defeating the master in one on one combat, and may in fact achieve a higher level of expertise than the master. This usually goes along with the teacher aging and perhaps declining in capability. ",

When the student is truly ready, the teacher will disappear.\u201d This phrase has different interpretations but according to me, it is the origin of \"the student has become the master\". It is because, when a student gains knowledge and experience more than the teacher than the positions are exchanged. By this, I don't mean to say that the honour o the student comes above the teacher, but it simply means that the student had attained more success than his master so I guess this was the linguistical etymology of the above phrase.

The fact, if not the phrase, actually goes back to the ancient Greek philosophers. Socrates was the master of his student, Plato, in turn, taught Aristotle. Aristotle, and at the time I went through school, he was considered the greatest of the Greek philosophers. The same happens in disciplines like music and finance, as well as the culinary arts and mathematics. \u2018We stand on the shoulders of giants\u2019 is a related phrase but it relates to the reality that generations build on one another.
