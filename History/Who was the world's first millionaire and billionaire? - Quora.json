            "answer_text": "This answer should be given in the form of the invention of the words and not speculation on the richest people ever. As such, there are two specific answers for the question. The very first time in history the word \u201cMillionaire\u201d was used to describe a wealthy person, was for John Law (1671\u20131729), the founder of the Mississippi Company. It was a new term invented specifically to describe John Law\u2019s wealth. At one time he was worth quite north of a million francs. Law was a Scottish gambler who became head of French finances on the speculation that the Mississippi Company had exclusive trading rights in Louisiana and this would create enormous profits. John Law actually gave the name, New Orleans, to the large city at the mouth of the Mississippi River to honor one of his backers at court. It\u2019s a fascinating story and he\u2019s an interesting character. The first U.S. dollar billionaire person was John D. Rockefeller. I don\u2019t know about a billion worth of any other world currency though. But he, again, was the first individual to whom this new term, Billionaire, was invented just to describe him. Short answer, John Law (Millionaire) and John D. Rockefeller (Billionaire). ",
