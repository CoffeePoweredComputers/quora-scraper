            "answer_text": "These are some of the greatest hidden treasures found across the world:- 1. Lost Adams DiggingsTo find a canyon wall that cries tears of gold you will need to map yourself a route to the Lost Adams Diggings in western New Mexico. It was in the early 1860s when Adams made his trek to the area. Guided along the White River and into the White Mountains, Adams and his crew of miners found gold nuggets that hidden \u201cin a corn-grinding basin.\u201d Although Adams left the mine on the second night, the miners stayed when they were brutally attacked and killed by Apache Indians. Tales say that Adams was never able to find his gold canyon again.  2. Apache Indian TreasuresThere is an abundance of real lost treasures, some of which belonged to the Apache Indians. Rumor has it that after attacking a wagon train the Apache Indians hid their stolen fortune of silver coins and gold dust in a Dutch oven. This oven, which contains the lost treasure, is hidden behind rocks at a point on Winchester Mountain in Arizona. Those in search of the treasure claim the point is cursed but that has not stopped treasure hunters from trying their luck.  3. Lost treasures of AntillaThose seeking the lost treasures of Antilla, the German fighter wreckage, will need to dive along the North Point of Aruba. There\u2019s a tale that claims the Antilla was anchored along the North Shore when authorities rowed out to sea and asked for its surrender. While the skipper contemplated his options on shore, he left the ship\u2019s seacock open, this sank the ship. Instead of surrendering and losing his treasure, the ship exploded and sank. This ghost ship, as the locals call it, remains a tribute to the German soldiers from WWII.  4. SS Islander\u2019s Evasive GoldIn a bit of irony the SS Islander that sank in 1901 was recovered in 2012-without any gold. Why is it on the list? Well the Mars Company, the expedition, crew thinks the gold may be on the sea bed as a result of moving the ship. They did find gold dust and pieces of gold on the recovered ship but that\u2019s about it. Mars Company estimates the treasure will be valued at over $250 million therefore they are planning another expedition. You can see part of the ship on the banks of Admiral Island while the rest is in Seattle.  5. Santissima ConcepcionHurricane season in Florida has led to many shipwrecks throughout history. One notable shipwreck that fell prey to the tumultuous southern hurricane season was the shipwreck of Santissima Concepcion or \u201cEl Grande.\u201d The record listed 500 people on board, but various reports have identified anywhere between 4 to 190 people who survived to describe their ordeal. Beyond the crew the record also lists 1,800,000 pesos in treasures, \u201c77 chests of pearls and 49 chests of emeralds.\u201d There have been numerous attempts to locate the treasure yet most have proved fruitless. It is believed the Sir William Phipp found about 25% of the treasure during his 1687 expedition.  6. Genghis Khan Issyk-Kul\u2019s TreasureThere are a variety of legends surrounding Lake Issyk-Kul. From the idea that Templar Knights and Christians buried treasures of the Templar there to lost jewels forming a golden path, many legends persist about the area. One of the most notable legends is of Commander Genghis who is supposedly buried with his treasures. Some legends have his treasure in the lake and others admit the location is unknown. Reports indicate that his soldiers killed everyone that knew the tomb\u2019s location and when they returned from the burial site, they were killed as well.Commander Genghis amassed his fortune by \u201ccapturing most of central Asia and China,\u201d in the 13-century, of which \u201cthe booty yielded by his conquests was incalculable.\u201d Digs in the \u201920s failed due to the instability of the political environment. Since then there have been more attempts including expeditions by the Japanese and a recent attempt by American researchers who believe they have located Genghis Khan\u2019s tomb, but there is no treasure to date.  7. White City, La Ciudad BlancaA rumored city of gold has been the fascination of many for some time. Herman Cortes stumbled upon it in 1526, then Cristobol de Pedraza in 1544. Archeologist William Strong noted \u2018archeological mounds\u2019 near Rio Patuca and Rio Conquirre in 1933, providing more fuel for a growing legend where \u201cnobles there ate from plates of gold.\u201d As recently as February this year, archeologists and other researchers from the National Science Foundation and the University of Houston have used advanced technology such as mapping light detection and Light detection and Ranging (LIDaR) to map the ancient ruins. The verdict is still out if this area holds treasures of gold.  8. Lue Treasure MapThe only legendary treasure to have a map that directs you to 14 tons of gold is the Lue. As mystifying as the code is, it has long been assumed the only tools needed to decode the Lue is a one dollar bill, a key and a sound understanding of Masonic symbolism. Published by Karl Von Mueller, some speculate the \u201cmap\u201d consists of various mathematical formulas.Believed to be in the United States, the legend of the Lue claims the treasure is 14 tons of gold. The gold was brought to the US by the Nazis in a plan to sabotage the US economy and prevent Americans from entering World War II. After hearing the plan, the Gold Act was instituted to circumvent the Nazis\u2019 plan. Failing to prevent the US from entering the war wasn't the only failure in Nazis\u2019 grand scheme. They also failed to decipher the Lue and the Nazi loyalist that created had died. Ultimately they were unable to retrieve the treasure and returned to Germany.  9. Treasure Chest of the Church of PiscoFour soldiers of the Peruvian Army in the mid-1800s devised a plan to outwit priests after learning about their treasures. Luke Barrett, Arthur Brown, Jack Killorain and Diego Alvarez, gained the confidence of the Pisco Church in Peru and managed to sail away with over 14 tons of gold and other treasures after killing the priests. Unfamiliar with the area, the four drew a map, ditched the loot and headed to Australia; with the hope of eventually returning and recovering their booty. Unfortunately, prior to returning for their treasure, two were killed and the other two were arrested. Only Killorain survived the jail stint. Before he died he told Charles Howe about the Pisco Church heist and where the treasure was stashed. When Howe found the treasure, he was not equipped to move the treasure. He left the treasure hoping to return and collect. Out of money, Howe failed to return to collect the treasure but he had disclosed the location to George Hamilton who eventually went looking for the treasure but never found it because he couldn't understand the map.  10. Yamashita\u2019s Treasure at Bacuit BayIn Palawan, Philippines, Bacuit Bay is an island that on its own should be considered a treasure. Bacuit Bay is small, yet boasts a legendary story about Tomoyuki Yamashita\u2019s lost treasures. A decorated general for the Japanese Army, it is speculated that Yamashita hid treasure in the caves of Bacuit Bay in the 1940s. Yamashita obtained his treasures by looting many bordering countries during the 30s until World War II. Yamashita\u2019s treasures includes loot from Malaysia, India, Thailand and Burma, which were all shipped to the Philippines prior to their final destination\u2014Japan. Unfortunately for Yamashita, Japan surrendered while he was still in the Philippines. Prior to being captured and hung, Yamashita hid his treasure in 172 different places on the island. He and his crew assumed they would eventually come back for the treasure. Some sources estimate that Yamashita\u2019s treasures could be worth billions today. In the 70s, Rogelio Roxas found part of the treasure. Unfortunately President Ferdinand Marcos confiscated his findings and the remaining treasure located in that particular tunnel. Roxas sued and was awarded $22 billion dollars. Although the Marcos and Roxas family continue to battle in court, based on the story, there are more caves filled with Yamashita\u2019s other treasures.

            "answer_text": "Treasure of Lima: Seized by the Spanish occupiers in Peru in 1823. It was intended to be transported to Mexico by ship when the captain killed his men and stole it. He was captured and brought to the Cocos Island off the coast of Costa Rica where he admitted to burying the loot. He later escaped custody and was never recaptured. The treasure was never seen again. The Lost Dutchman Mine: Superstition Mountain in Arizona is the supposed location of huge gold mine. Several men or teams of men returned from the mountain with the metal or sent it to their families. Almost all of them however, met grisly fates or simply vanished, likely due to the presence of the Apache in the region. There is definitely a mine there, but nobody has returned with gold since then. King John\u2019s Jewels: According to legend, the unpopular king was travelling shortly before his death in 1216 when he became very ill. He decided to take the safe roads home and send his belongings, including the jewels through The Wash in East Anglia. The area was only accessible during low tides. His men and his belongings were unable to cross the area in time before the tide came in sucking the convoy down through quicksand and whirlpools. The Romanov Jewels: After the Russian royal family were overthrown and murdered by revolutionaries during the Russian Civil War, most of their possessions were taken, catalogued and secured by the Bolsheviks, some of which was never seen again. However, the Romanovs tried desperately to hide their valuables up until the day of their executions and they definitely succeeded in hiding a great deal of them as evidenced by some of them turning up after their deaths. No one knows where they hid the rest of their wealth. Imperial Faberge Eggs: Another Romanov mystery since 8 out of 50 eggs are still unaccounted for today. The Romanovs loved the eggs so much, they purchased two every year. Some of these eggs have been sold for a whopping $9 million. A lost egg is likely to double that, even triple that price. Flor de la Mar: A 400-ton Portuguese carrack. Why is this ship on the list? The reason why is because it sank off the Strait of Malacca in 1511 with the largest treasure in maritime history. Its cargo is well documented, but has yet to be found. The Tomb of Genghis Khan: One of the most memorable figures in history and leader of the largest empire in history, whose remains have yet to be found. After his death in 1227, he was buried in a hidden tomb. Legend has it that executioners had the constructors of the tomb killed to ensure the emperor\u2019s tomb remained a secret. Legend also has it that there is an enormous trove of riches buried with him. The Lake Toplitz Nazi Treasure: With the Allies closing in, Nazis ordered the locals to transport them to the lake in Austria. Locals would witness them dumping heavy boxes into it. The Nazis allegedly filled the boxes with more than 100 million dollars worth of counterfeit pound sterling notes. It would appear that these boxes would be easily found. However, the bottom half of the lake does not contain oxygen and there is a layer of logs floating just above that level, making it impossible for divers to venture that far underwater. The Amber Room: This story seems too good to be true, but it was real, and much more than that. It was highly ornate and decked out in precious and semi-precious jewels. It was 11 feet by 11 feet of glistening treasure that would be worth almost $200 million if anyone knew where it was. Nazi Germany stole it from the Soviet Union during World War II. They had it for a few years in Konigsburg, but after extensive firebombing by the Royal Air Force and heavy artillery bombardment by the advancing Red Army, it was lost. Nobody knows where the treasure is today. The Crown Jewels of Ireland: While not the most valuable of the treasures on this list, the Crown Jewels of Ireland indeed whet missing in one of the most interesting ways. They were kept by the Order of St. Patrick, from which they were stolen right under the nose of the guard in 1907. It is not known who stole them, but many suspects include Lord Haddo of the Scottish peerage, British Army Captain Richard Gorges, Ernest Shackleton\u2019s brother, Francis, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and even Irish Unionists.
