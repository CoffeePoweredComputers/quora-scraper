            "answer_text": "According to my own AncestryDNA testing, there still may be a blood line that exists, which stems from very distant cousins of mine (5th-8th cousins), who married some Medici\u2019s (Battani), though there is a substantial gap in the genealogical line which I cannot explain, nor could Ancestry DNA. This may begin through illegitimate children of Alessandro Medici, who many believe is an illegitimate child of Pope Clement VII. His mother was a black slave in the House of Medici; his children, mothered by a mistress named Taddea Malaspina, has passed on the genetic DNA through their illegitimate children to Medici's that married into the French Royalty. This line possibly exists in Detroit, which could be explained as Detroit was a French Colony until the 1800\u2018s. Should there be any Medici\u2019s in this line, they certainly have no right to any family assets, but they carry the family name and perhaps some of the recognition associated with the family line in terms of the social perception of having this last name. Keep in mind, today they may stand to be the 20+ great grandchildren of the First Duke of Florence. That is not a lot of blood, but it\u2019s as potent as it might be for those living today if they truly are blood relatives. ",

            "answer_text": "Just so happened to play Crusader Kings II by Paradox Interactive, I think I know a speck on some Houses in Europe spanning from Early Middle Age to Late middle age. Although the House of Medici became prominent around 1500s(After Middle age), their influence in the peninsula of Italia(Duchy of Tuscany, Urbino, Florence\u2026) didn't fade until around 1800s when Italy itself starts to lose its economical influence on Europe. France, Russia, and later Prussia became the Greater Power of Europe. The House of Medici, was essentially a family that became powerful because of its financial influence over the rich and prosperous regions in Italy. With current economical state of Italy in modern era, and that Medici didn't expand its influence beyond Europe, unlike the House of Rothschild, the House of Medici faded when their wealth and political power diminished. As far as recorded information suggests, I think there wouldn't be anymore descendent or any interested claimants. This is because there aren't anymore assets under the claim of the House of Medici. \u201cNothingness\u201d cannot be claimed. FYI: The last decendent of the House of Medici, a Duke, died without a male heir in the 1737. With an Agnatic succession law, there won't be any legitimate female heir. ",

            "answer_text": "They\u2019re descended from the female lines rather than the men who held power, but yes. The line starting with Cosimo died out before the Grand Dukes, then the Grand Dukes went extinct in 1737. However, there are a few other lines which can claim collateral descent. The most notably is probably this dude, Giovan Battista, prince of Ottajano. Among other things, Giovan argues that his family should have been given Tuscany after the previous dukes died out. There are also a few Medici descendants who hold lesser titles. ",

Beginning in 1434 with the rise to power of Cosimo de\u2019 Medici (or Cosimo the Elder), the family\u2019s support of the arts and humanities made Florence into the cradle of the Renaissance, a cultural flowering rivaled only by that of ancient Greece. The Medicis produced four popes (Leo X, Clement VII, Pius IV and Leon XI), and their genes have been mixed into many of Europe\u2019s royal families. The last Medici ruler died without a male heir in 1737, ending the family dynasty after almost three centuries. ",
