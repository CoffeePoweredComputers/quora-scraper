            "answer_text": ".17 can kill a bear, in fact .17 can kill a polar bear, it's all about shot placement. The less energy the round has the more precise the shot must be to cause damage to vitals. .308 is an excellent round with excellent cross section and good terminal ballistics, which in layman's terms, means it's good at reaching out long distances and retaining it's kinetic energy, and once it gets to the target it's good at transferring it's energy to the target. So yes, .308 can in fact kill a bear. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. It's quite good for black bear but light for a grizzly. That said, the record for the largest grizzly killed for many years was held by an Inuit woman using the diminutive .22 Short so, as others have written, shot placement is the critical thing. A perfectly placed shot with a .22 Short will kill while a poorly placed shot with a .458 will wound. ",
