You can rely on some others here: Google and Google I\u2019ve always found 1 thing leads to another, and expertise develops if pursued, even from that small Google start. If you can write a small book or Smithsonian article, more power to you. DO NOT forget the illustrations and pictures! If copyright by others, you correspond for permissions, and keep the correspondence results file, also payment records that may apply. Be SURE you are dealing with the TRUE copyright owner. Take your own photos too. And some illustrations / photos are free to use. Publisher has to get straight skinny from lawyer, sometimes make arrangements, proper credits, BUT you supply the stuff for them to work on. So, have all these well sourced\u2026 Museums not likely to charge, they want all book publicity they can get, museum name always prominent, AND they have endless unseen artefacts collections, another first base for correspondence. Do not forget the colorful stories, incidents and places of your work, oddities, stories about the real people, male and female, and so on. Make it very interesting, see? The most appealing related content! This particular project has wide appeal too, a money maker. ",
