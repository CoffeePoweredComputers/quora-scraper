            "answer_text": "The Mongols and Scythians originally lived on two different ends of the Eurasian Steppe and reach the height of their civilizations in very different time periods. When the first real recordings of people we believe were Mongol took place by the Chinese during the Han Dynasty (Wuhu and Xianbei) that is in the 2nd Century BCE. They lived in on the border of Northeast China. Somewhere between the 3rd-6th century BCE (depending on who you think is Scythian disappear from history. The last of which, in Central Asia, were absorbed by the growing expansion of the Turks out of Western Mongolia. Some went into India, and were also absorbed into the much larger dense agricultural culture there.  The first mention of the Mongols in historic text, I believe placed them somewhere around north eastern China and in Eastern Monglia, which would place them east of the Turks, which were in central and Western Mongolia (there was likely overlap in territory because these people were nomadic). The blue shows the first major Turkic Khanate (TuJue in Chinese) the Goturks. Being a typical federation though there were likely proto-Mongolic tribes involved in the GoTurks as well and spread out over this region\u2026so\u2026  It is thought that Turks, Mongols, and maybe other nameless nomadic tribes did form confederations at times and constitute groups like the Hun (Xiongnu) (that predate all agreed upon Turkic and Mongolian Khanates) in ancient time, but there is no agreement on who the Hun where and if they were a multi-ethnic confederation when they were on the Eastern Steppe or if that only occurred as they moved into the Western Eurasia steppe before they came into contact with the Roman Empire. By the time the Hun came into contact with Romans there were Germanic tribes and Scythians among them. Language: Mongolian is in the Altaic family, very closely related to Tungusic and Turkic languages, and possibly (although controversially) to Korean and Japanese. Scythians were Iranic speakers, which is an IndoEuroepean language, mostly closely related to Modern Persian, Pashto, Kurdish. So these groups were unrelated, although there words that were shared, especially words from Iranic origin that came into Turkic and also into Mongol. The problem is \u201cwhen\u201d and from what \u201cIranic speakers\u201d. This is a complicated subject. Turkic people had literally a 1,000 years or more contact with Iranic speakers. Culturally: My understanding of there tool-kit, their clothing, housing, etc. is not so good, but I believe based on previous reading that they both were both semi-nomadic horsemen, that were fond of using bow and arrow. They also both lived in similar housing, something like a Yurt. There seems to be agreement that this domesticated horse culture and also chariot riding originated on the Western Eurasian steppe and was a traid mark of IndoEuropean nomadic tribes there (like the Scythians). That being said there were distinct Scythian traits, but I\u2019m not expert on this.  My conclusion: Since these people never wrote anything themselves or only started writing late in history, we can only rely on spotty written records from \u201coutsiders\u201d, mostly settled agricultural empires as to who these people were, their culture, what they looked like, their religion, etc. Overall It think in the Western Eurasian steppe you had Iranic speakers (the largest of which were Scythians) they lived all the way to Western Mongolia, where it seemed that Turks were dominate and then you had Mongol tribes to the East, closer to north eastern China.  We actually do not know for certain when and where Mongolians arose as a separate people in history, for example. There is much debate about this. We just know it was somewhere on the Eastern Steppe, north of one of the Chinese kingdoms. The Chinese are not even sure. The first \u201cMongolic people\u201d they seem to record are possibly the very ancient Beidi (Qin Dynasty era) who might have been the same as the Donghu, who the Chinese said the Xianbei and the Wuhan came from. The latter two are believed by most historians to be \u201cMongolic speakers\u201d. The Xianbei appeared during the Han Dynasty (after the Qin) and eventually went on to form their own Sininized Dynasty in Northern China in the 4th century CE. There was some genetic contact, but most of it was not until the Turks started moving West out of Mongolia. They basically absorbed other steppe people into their confederation (many IndoEuropean speaking) and also eventually took over the formerly Iranic (and other INdoEuropean) speaking populations of Central Asia (also mixing with them). So the Turks were on the contact zone with IndoEuropeans for a long period. It appears the Mongols were not. In the contact zone is also appears the gene flow was from East to West, but not much from West to East, at least not since the time of the Scythians, but most of that mixing seemed to be Scythian males and Eastern Eurasian females, which is not strange in a patriarchal culture known to raiding for (cattle, horses, women). Males were mostly all R1A, which is common in Eastern Europeans today and present in various forms in parts of India as well (a typical IndoEuropean marker). These early studies have been elaborated by an increasing number of studies by Russian scholars. Conclusions which might be drawn thus far, from an mtDNA perspective, are (i) an early, Bronze Age mixture of both west and east Eurasian lineages, with western lineages being found far to the East, but not vice versa; (ii) an apparent reversal by Iron Age times, with increasing presence of East Eurasian lineages in the western steppe; (iii) the possible role of migrations from the sedentary south: the Balkano-Danubian and Iranian regions toward the steppe. [50] [51] [52] Before the Turks began to spread into the West Eurasian steppe, I believe my favorite phrase applies, \u201cpots travel faster than boots\u201d. Primarily through trade, it seems the Eastern Eurasians on the Eastern Steppe eventually gained the technology of the Western steppe. We know by the settled agricultural Chinese used chariottes by 1250 BCE, which they got either directly from IndoEuropean steppe people or Turkic or proto-Mongolic steppe people (Xiongnu). The contact zone was in the Northwest of the Shang Dynasty. The Chinese often used the same name for different \u201csteppe nomadic groups\u201d, I think because they were all seen as \u201cbarbarians\u201d the big difference was \u201cwhat direction they lived in\u201d\u2026so there is a lot of confusion in Chinese literature who was who, and at what time did they exist.  So the relationship is there, but I think it is more one of cultural borrowing, sharing across the steppe than genetic. Mongols, unlike Turks are clearly Eastern Eurasian people on the female and male sides. They group very closely with other people in Eastern Eurasia. ",
