            "answer_text": "Feuds are revenge attacks. The Norse, in particular, were very fond of them. How many people lived in a feud? We don\u2019t know, but the Norse sagas are full of them, so read the sagas and count: maybe that will give you an idea. Now a manor, is entirely different, as it is a unit of farmland and its population. Which country and what part of said country will affect the answer, so you need to be more specific. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh, it depends on the area and which medieval period and also depends on the method of your calculation. Based on what I read and observed, about one million people live under the arrangement of manor system throughout medieval England. There were about 30,000 manors at that time. So it is estimated that about 20 to 30 people would be living in a manor. By the way, a manor is tiny. It is about 4 square kilometers. ",
