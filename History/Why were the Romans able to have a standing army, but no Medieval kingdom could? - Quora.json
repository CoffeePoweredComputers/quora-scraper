            "answer_text": "In short: Money, and Production. And there were some medieval kingdoms that could. The problem is that a large professional army is difficult to sustain by Medieval population/production means. An army is EXPENSIVE. Those, in peace time, are men who have to be fed, paid, their equipment supplied, their needs somewhat catered (peasant revolts are bad; military revolts are much worse), and who don't really produce anything enough to be even half-way to self-sufficient. And those that I speak of are Roman Legionaries, who at least could build public works (bridges, roads, aqueducts), supply from their numbers builders, blacksmiths, hunters, etc.  Also, a farmer doesn't just produce for himself and his family, he also pays taxes from his crops, which feed others not directly involved in food production, like nobles, tradesmen, etc. So a large professional soldier force not only does not produce, but consume a staggering amount.The Romans sidestepped the problem by having a large and cheap production source: slave labour, fueled by the victorious battles of the Legions.  That was also the Roman main problem. Expand or die.You always needed more slaves (agriculture and mining slaves had a high 'turnover' rate), more food, more raw materials, and for those you have to fight more wars and WIN them, and protect what you already have, so you need more soldiers, so then you need more production to sustain them, so you need more slaves and more food and more raw materials... So a medieval power could rarely afford a standing army, unless it was extremely rich. The only ones who had a true standing army (that springs to my mind) and not just the leader's own men were The Byzantine Empire (mostly through commerce) and The Ottoman Empire (commerce, tributes and raiding).  There was also, for a relatively short period, Hungary\u2019s Black Army, built up by Mathias Corvinus, and payed for by him misappropriating the funds the Pope sent for a Crusade against the Ottomans, but Hungary couldn\u2019t support it for long and it more-or-less disbanded soon after Mathias\u2019 death.

            "answer_text": "Lack of money. Rome was a unified country that worked more like a modern one, where people held offices but didn\u2019t own the land they were responsible for (usually). Feudalism was a wholly different system of government. The King didn\u2019t have the authority to maintain a standing army as he due to fuedualism he had very little control over the terriorty his vassals held. And it was only towards the end of the medieval period when Absolute Monarchys and the rise of Scuttage began to reappear that it was possible to do so. Charles the Bald kicked off modern Feudalism after he couldn\u2019t pay for this mercenaries and personal army couldn\u2019t get the job done fighting one of his brothers, so he offered them the land they conquered to manage it for him in exchange for yearly taxes and sending men to fight in his armies. This allowed him to pull together a MUCH larger force than people who kept using the old version could, but it was also unwieldy and early on, the vassals had a lot of rights and privileges and the king could land in hot water if he pissed off his vassals. However over time, the process of scuttage became more and more common with nobles gradually disliking the disruption the campaign period caused to their realms and eventually just started paying higher taxes so that the king could afford to hire and maintain his own bigger army. Which combined with the Monarchy re-asserting itself as a unified nation rather than a collection of vassals, lead to the return of standing armies as they now had the infrastructure to properly support them again.
