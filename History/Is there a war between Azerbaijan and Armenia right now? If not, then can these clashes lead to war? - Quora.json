            "answer_text": "Yes, there have been clashes between the Azerbaijani and Armenian armed forces since yesterday. They have resuming on and off today as well. According to the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense, the clashes are the result of the provocation by the Armenian military. While it is usual that Azerbaijani and Armenian officials always trade accusations, these clashes are highly likely to have been provoked by the Armenian military. To explain it, Azerbaijani and Armenian armies stand face-to-face along the Armenian-Azerbaijani international border and along the so-called line of contact (LoC), which separate Armenian-occupied territories of Azerbaijan from Azerbaijan proper. Most of the times, fiercest clashes have happened in the LoC. The international borderline between Armenia and Azerbaijan has been spared from deadly clashes, and reasons for it include that Azerbaijan is after reclaiming its occupied territories, not invade Armenia\u2019s territories. Yet, the most important reason is this: Armenia is a member of the CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organization), a NATO-like military allience including Russia, Armenia and several CIS countries. According to the CSTO charter, in the case of an attack on one member, others members are beholden to come to the defense. Therefore, Azerbaijan would never seek large clashes along the borderline. Even if it did, it would do it along the LoC where the CSTO response would not be necessitated. The north of the international border closer to Georgia is where the clashes are happening now. The Armenian military managed to capture a hill but today the area was reclaimed by the Azerbaijani military, which has so far reported about 4 dead and 5 injured Azerbaijani soldiers. With Azerbaijan being unlikely to have provoked the clashes, we are left with two options only: 1) Armenia has provoked the clashes 2) Some small incident has unintentionally has slid into these deadly clashes. Both can be the reason. Armenia goes through politically not very stable times. Pashinyan has faced challenges from his opponents, the representatives of the Karabakh clan and others. There are other factors. And as of the second scenario, it is likely as well since there has always been a probability that small exchanges of fire can lead to a large-scale war. So, this can\u2019t be excluded. The outbreak of a full-scale war cannot be excluded fully; yet, as of now, it seems unlikely. The clashes are probably going to end soon. ",
