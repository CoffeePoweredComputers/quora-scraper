            "answer_text": "There was a lot of griping about the food supplied to US troops during the war. But, as another poster mentioned, coming out of the depression, a lot of soldiers were eating well, and consistently, for the first time in years. The US also put HUGE amounts of research and effort into programs to come up with better ways of getting a variety of nutritional, shelf-stable food to the troops. This was especially important in the Pacific, where ambient weather conditions (extremes in heat and humidity as well as insects) could play havoc with rations. The C and K rations, while widely reviled, provided the troops with the nutrition they needed when they couldn\u2019t be served by field kitchens or more stable facilities. When there was access to field kitchens the food tended to be better, but it still wasn\u2019t home cooking. I THINK Eugene Sledge, in his book \u201cWith the Old Breed\u201d (it may have been another book by another author) about his time with the Marines in the Pacific, talks about the food he encountered at various times. One of the biggest disappointments the front line troops encountered was the disparity of what was served to the officers (they often got the choicest cuts of meat, fresh vegetables, etc.) vs what was served to the enlisted personnel. Essentially, while the food offered to US troops wasn\u2019t generally well liked, it at least was edible, was nutritious, and was available in sufficient quantities. ",

            "answer_text": "Depending on the climate a American soldiers food was designed to provide a healthy diet of between 2600 and 3300 calories per day. Because of the American expertise in logistics this calorie count was almost always provided (with the exception of the Pacific where US soldiers starved to death in the Philippines and food was very chancy at Guadalcanal (early in the battle)). The German diet provided similar calorie counts with much higher percentages of carbohydrates (bread) than the American diet. German logistics, being very inconsistent, the German soldier diet could be infinitely inconsistent. Further, encirclement would mean the starving to death of tens of thousands of German soldiers (Stalingrad being the best example after Nov. 1942). The Soviets and Japanese often starved to death due to logistics failures and encirclements. The Red Army was the only European army which had massive hunger and starvation even in circumstances where they were not surrounded. If you read any Red Army biography of WWII hunger is a constant subject. ",
