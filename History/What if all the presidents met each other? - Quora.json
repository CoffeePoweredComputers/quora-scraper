You\u2019d have Washington, Lincoln, the Roosevelts, and maybe Obama hanging out together, with humorous and cringe worthy comments like how they\u2019re amazed \u2018the negro\u2019 finally got the position. Then you\u2019d have the beta cool group. Reagan, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Wilson, and Grant all hanging out talking about how great things were and how things have gone off the rails. Clinton would probably be there lamenting that no women have gotten elected president yet. Then the \u2018too cool\u2019 group: Jefferson, Adams, Madison, LBJ and Jackson. They\u2019d be REALLY critical about life today. There\u2019d be the \u2018ehhh\u2019 group of misfits. Middle stringers. Truman. The Bushes. Polk. Ford. They mostly just talk shop. Then you\u2019d have the ones that don\u2019t socialize well. Nixon. I think Carter would keep him company, because he\u2019s such a nice guy. Coolidge. Then you;d have the \u2018bad presidents\u2019 group. Taft wondering where Warren is. Hoover muttering that the depression would have worked itself out. Johnson lamenting almost getting kicked out by one vote. James Buchanan just fuming. Then the door slams open and in walks Trump, marching right up to Washington and company. \u201cThis is yuge. This is so yuge! I\u2019m such a yuge fan!\u201d Utter and complete silence. Obama just covers his face and pretends this makes Trump go away as Washington stares with a face of \u2018Good god, what is this orange thing in our company?\u2019. And from the back of the room, we hear James Buchanan cry out, \u201cWhooo hooo! I\u2019m not the worst!\u201d ",
