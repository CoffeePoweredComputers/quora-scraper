            "answer_text": "Depends on which part of the Renaissance you're referencing. If you're thinking early Renaissance, Donatello is the ground-breaker, and arguably remaining the best sculptor for the entire era. Everything follows Donatello and the ancient Greeks/Romans after people started uncovering and viewing more relics. Michelangelo basically cribbed David from a mash-up of Donatello's St. George and Lo Zuccone (aka the Prophet Habbakuk). Verocchio was a well-regarded sculptor as well. The viewer with a keen eye can really see the influence he had on his young student, Leonardo da Vinci. His works are delicate, classic, and fine-boned. They are of course following the Donatello example, and Verocchio's David looks like a slightly older, more awkwardly-adolescent version of Donatello's David. In my mind, Verocchio wins all the David wars until Bernini busted his out onto the scene, simply because Verocchio's is less stylized, has no double-meaning, and clearly takes the Bible text into account the closest. He's a skinny pre-teen kid who never should have been able to kill that giant. Michelangelo's David is way too powerful, and Donatello's is way too confident... even cocky. Speaking of Michelangelo, he, of course, is one of the pre-eminent sculptors of modernity, owing his greatness to an intense study of the classics (he even helped piece together part of the Laocoon Group at the Vatican) and specifically Donatello. His study of human anatomy lended an air of realism to his works that other sculptors, Donatello included, were unable to achieve. He never considered himself a painter, architect, or poet... those were things he did either only when forced to or to pass the time. He always self-identified as a sculptor, and for very good reason. ",
