            "answer_text": "Why did the Federals take more casualties than the CSA in the Overland Campaign? They were on offense. Battle lines delivered the most firepower defensively and offensively. Offensive firepower alone would not ensure success. Attackers had to charge, and massed columns, with their greater depth, were often preferable to battle lines for making frontal assaults. In Battle Tactics of the Civil War, Paddy Griffith argues that, far from being the first 'modern' war, the Civil War was the last 'Napoleonic' war. Military theory of the day suggested that offensive forces needed a three to one advantage in numbers to overcome previously entrenched enemy troops. Though this tactic \u2014 formulated in the Napoleonic Era and taught in the military schools of the 19th century \u2014 was essential to battlefield success prior to the Civil War, it was now disastrous. The Baron Jomini had written warning that widely spread lines could produce chaos inducing disorganization. Yet Civil War Era soldiers armed with rifled muskets and supported by artillery made all the soldiers on the field in formation \"sitting Ducks.\" The new emphasis was on grand movements, rapidity of fire, and marksmanship. [David G. Chandler, The Military Maxims of Napoleon (London: Da Capo Press 1995) 72 ] By 1864, infantry customarily erected light field fortifications to strengthen its defensive battlefield positions and protect itself from enemy rifle power; but when attacking, whether against battle lines or fortifications, infantry continued suffering heavy casualties through clinging to tactical formations outmoded by technology. Grant had nothing like the ratio of forces to overwhelm Lee by numbers, yet he was able to pry Lee out of position time and again by grand maneuvers. May of 1864 was the bloodiest month of the Civil War with more than 100,000 total casualties in the Eastern Theater alone. Grant was called a butcher, but he continued to fight through the Wilderness and Spotsylvania ending up in front of Petersburg in July 1864. At Cold Harbor, Grant advised Meade to vigorously exploit any successful part of the assault. Meade ordered his three corps commanders on the left to assault at once, but they resisted calling further attacks a \"wanton waste of life\". Grant conceded and wrote to Meade, \"The opinion of the corps commanders not being sanguine of success in case an assault is ordered, you may direct a suspension of further advance for the present.\" Grant formally requested a two-hour cessation of hostilities to recover the wounded. Estimates of casualties on just one morning were from 3,000 to 7,000 on the Union side in less than a half hour, no more than 1,500 on the Confederate. The armies faced each other for nine days.

            "answer_text": "I suspect you\u2019re talking about \u201ccasualties\u201d, which is killed + wounded + captured, rather than \u201cjust\u201d deaths. Three reasons: #1, Union casualty figures are known. The Confederate army was losing organization, and we can only estimate their losses. Total Union casualties across the campaign were about 7600 dead + 38,000 wounded, and 9000 captured or missing, for a total of about 55,000. Total Confederate casualties are between 30,000 and 35,000 \u2013 but that\u2019s an estimate, and we have no breakdown of killed/wounded/captured. So we tend to compare \u201chard\u201d Union data to soft or vague Confederate data. That gives extra weight to the more-solid number and de-emphasizes the vague number. #2, that era of war was the most strongly tilted in favor of defense of any time in history \u2013 trenches and rifled muskets, no tanks or gas \u2013 and Grant\u2019s Union forces were continually on the offense, while Lee\u2019s Confederate forces were making a fighting retreat across the roughly 80 miles from Fredericksburg to Petersburg. #3, Grant screwed up at Cold Harbor, when he ordered that second assault (June 3). About a quarter or a third of the total difference between Union & Confederate casualties in the whole campaign, happened in that single maneuver. Grant acknowledged it as a mistake decades later in his Memoirs. Grant suffered about as many casualties in that hour or so, as Lee had in the entire battle of Antietam, or Chancellorsville, or in Pickett's Charge. ",

            "answer_text": "The Union troops were basically forced to assault well-entrenched veterans who had carefully chosen their own ground to defend. They were well-armed with rifles deadly at 400 yards and supported by artillery carefully positioned to inflict maximum casualties. The result was not surprising: by that stage of the war, attacking commanders were accustomed to accepting significantly greater casualties than the defenders. They planned for this by trying to achieve numerical superiority of 3:1 to successfully carry a position and then hold it against the inevitable counterattack. Grant knew the odds when he set out. In fact, his whole plan was based on using his huge numerical advantage to grind Lee down. He knew he could replace his losses but every man Lee lost was gone for good. This is the cold, brutal essence of fighting a campaign of attrition. From a purely strategic perspective, it was a logical, practical option that would eventually gain victory. Grant and Lee both knew it was a fight the South could not win. Attrition is a well-accepted doctrine of war played out in every major conflict of the 19th and 20th centuries. WWI as a whole was about attrition: grinding down the enemy when manoeuvre isn't an option. The same is true for Stalingrad, Caen and the Sheldt. Sadly, it's the dirty-faced lads in the hole who become the hard currency of battle. ",

Offense is almost always more costly than defense. Union general Grant knew that, since the North had a much larger army and still had men back home it could recruit while the South had already scraped the bottom of the recruiting barrel, the Union forces could AFFORD higher casualties than Confed general Lee could. The Overland Campaign cost Lee about 50% of his army. ",
