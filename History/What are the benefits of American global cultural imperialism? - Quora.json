            "answer_text": "What are the benefits of American global cultural imperialism?  I am assuming that OP means the culture of the United States of America when they say \u2018American\u2019. There can be many arguments whether there is any cultural imperialism (such a pejorative term that one) from the United States. Even if there is, there can be a dispute on whether it is deliberate the way in which the Roman empire or indeed the British empire operated. What is probably undoubted is that the culture of the United States of America has substantial influence around the world. Whether it is in the food, music, clothes, dance form, TV shows, work ethics or any other aspects related to life really. The benefits for the USA are clear; market for their brands, soft power over other countries and such. However, there are benefits for the \u2018others\u2019 as well. Two such benefits come to mind: First time visitors to the United States from the developing world do not need to get as nervous as they would have, say a few decades back. They already know what to expect and in some cases have dealt with something similar back home.People across cultures have access to a common idiom as means to enhance communications. Two or more people from very different cultures can use a commonly understood cultural metaphor that they could understand.",

            "answer_text": "Before we start, two important considerations: Since no culture is inherently \"superior\" to another (the difference being in material advancement and knowledge, provided by civilisation), \"cultural imperialism\" cannot be an \"improvement\" in itself.Cultural imperialism is nothing new, there is no reason to celebrate it as a feature of our modern world.Now that we have this settled (as the foundations of my following exposition), let's try to tackle this difficult issue. It must be split into three questions: We must distinguish things that are specifically American from those which are common to the entire Anglosphere. We must distinguish things that were created in the United States but are multicultural in nature from those created in the United States but are centred on American values and goals.We must distinguish things that are the result of specific American policies and developments from those created as a result of the development of capitalism.This is actually a huge task, so the answer will be mind-blowing big, but will still fall short of being satisfactory. I have said that \"no culture is inherently superior to another\" because that is one of the basic tenets of social sciences. I don't personally agree with that statement in full, but I am taking it for granted because the same people who cry wolf at cultural imperialism are those who agree with it. The sylogism is simple: a) Cultural imperialism is the imposition of cultural values from one specific culture onto other culturesb) No culture is superior to any otherc) Therefore, cultural imperialism is neither positive nor negative for the affected culture. We can't eat the cake and have it. Unless we agree that there are different values in different cultures that we risk losing to cultural imperialism we have no reason to think cultural imperialism is a problem. However, this is a false sylogism, because the problem with cultural imperialism does not lie in the cultural change itself, but on associated factors, which I will mention later. Cultural imperialism is nothing new because it is the business of dominant cultures to impose themselves on whatever neighbours that are too weak (culturally, military or economically). The Romans did it so well that Latin replaced Iberian languages in Portugal and Spain; Celtic languages in Galicia, France and the Low Countries; whatever languages were formerly spoken in Panonia and Dalmatia (now Croatia); Dacian and Thracian in the East Balkans and nearly wiped out North African languages (before being displaced by the Arab conquest). Cultural imperialism, as a matter of fact, is an inherent part of imperialism, which is itself an inherent part of the clash between nations. As Fernando Pessoa (Portuguese poet) once said: if you want to be understood, teach your language. All the world understands American politics because English is well-known abroad. How known ins Russian and how well is Russian politics understood? This is a very didactic example. But you can have more: Arabic, Chinese, even Portuguese and Spanish. All languages are islands in themselves, except English. English makes Australian politics news over the world, while a country like China (much more powerful and important) is dwarfed by it. Cultural imperialism is not a result of \"globalisation\", which, itself, is nothing new either. Remember the Romans had contacts with India and China (or should I say that the Indians and the Chinese had contacts with Rome?). Remember that the varangians (one of the \"viking\" peoples) had settlements over Eastern Europe, the Byzantine Empire and the Arab world (they reportedly sailed the Sea of Arabia). The Chinese had their own age of discoveries, but they lost interest in it because they didn't find business ventures worth the trouble (and China was not undergoing a  Capitalist revolution by them). Contacts between civilisations always existed (though I still want to know better about Vinland and the Kensington Runestone). The only new thing about what we now call \"globalisation\" is in scale and speed. Scale and speed have made cultural imperialism easier, more far-reaching and deeper. We cannot think of cultural imperialism without the necessary connection to military imperialism. A language is a military weapon. Though I am sceptical of the Sapir-Whorf hipothesis that language affects the way we think, I believe that teaching your language is helpful to make the world more sympathetic at your values.  I also believe that cultural imperialism nowadays is a deliberate policy. There's nothing \"natural\" or \"spontaneous\" about it. American corporations drive American interests and American values to make room for their products and idelogies, and the American state sees it as good for American interests. Especially in poorer countries, there is no way to resist.  Would you miss the latest blockbuster sci-fi movie to see a homegrown production with inferior special effects? Could Egypt, Iran, Brazil or Nigeria make a movie so packed with CGI and effects like \"Transformers\" or \"Star Trek\"? Would the people flock to cinemas to see such local films, instead of the American-made productions about which the internet is ablaze? If you believe people in other countries see American blockbusters because they \"like\" them you surely are a very na\u00efve person.  And there is more. American corporations manufacture or order toys and all other types of memorabilia related to those movies. Such things are made by the millions of units, driving their prices low as a result of economy of scale. They are sold dirt-cheap, they help drive audience to the movies and they are cheaper than those produced connected with local movies (if these are produced at all). American corporations wash each other hands in this: Has McDonald's ever offered toys related to Ast\u00e9rix in France? Perhaps, because the French are more resistant to cultural imperialism, but has it offered toys related to Monica's Gang in Brazil? No. In the end, it is not about advancement or superiority, but about money. Cultural imperialism means building global brands to keep money flowing to the cultural centre irradiating the cultural products that are consumed over the world. For what reason did the United Kingdom give those knighthood medals to The Beatles (and to a series of pop culture icons later)? Because they built brands that  sold and brought money back to the UK. Though I believe there is no quality loss in cultural imperialism, there are other types of losses that are important, these are the \"associated factors\" I mentioned above. a) Cultural imperialism implies ideological colonisation. Because English is so transparent to us (as we have learned it), all American ideologies (including those most obnoxious that even the Americans deride) have a one-way ticket into other countries, like Brazil. We cannot improve on these ideologies, we cannot send anything back, we can only swallow. Our only chance to influence them is to become part of it, which is time-consuming enough to become impossible to most people.b) Cultural imperialism makes one language a filter to the world, denying other cultures a full knowledge of their own ideologies and characteristics. I, for one, am very curious about the cultures of Russia, Romania and China, but I can only have any access to them through English. This is significant because it means I can only know about them what has been intentionally translated into English. I have to see them through the eyes of the people who have seen them and decided to show them to me. With Spanish I don't have this problem: I am fully competent on the language and can understand all Latin America very well (not as much Spain, because I am more distanced from it). c) Cultural imperialism silences local voice and makes the world plainer. As pop culture thrives, there is a myriad music styles dying, for instance. Some of them could be very interesting, but we will never know. Cultural imperialism occupies greedily the space that could be shared by other cultures. Until the seventies, it was commonplace to hear Latin American, French, Italian (most of all) and even German music in Brazil. Nowadays we only get music from other cultures when it has had a breakthrough in the English-speaking world first (Khaled, PSY, O-Zone). In the end, Cultural imperialism is not negative because it kills \"better\" cultures but because it brings \"monoculture\" to our world. But what is specifically \"American\" in American cultural imperialism? A large part of \"American\" cultural imperialism is actually composed by cultural artifacts inherited from the United Kingdom (English language itself is an example), from other European countries (like the French ideals of the Revolution) or from the common Western inheritance that dates back from the days of Rome. When the \"American\" cultural imperialism advances such cultural artifacts we cannot accuse the USA of nothing more than propagating values and cultural byproducts that would have been propagated by any other Western power in its place. Some of the American contributions to the world were actually created by a multicultural  society that existed on top of the \"deep America\" and was often at odds with it. I seriously doubt, for instance, that the average American thinks that the global spreadth of the Hare Krishna sect is an American contribution, but in fact we only have this sect over the world because its founder (Swami Prabhupada) had learned English in India (a by-product of British colonisation of the Indian subcontinent) and later moved to the United States to teach. Same can be said of the Rosicrucian order (extinguished in Europe, it was refounded in the USA) or even Freemasonry. Though American culture has been a filter between different parts of the rest of the world, the use of this filter is not always under control of the USA or of any American institutions.  On a later note: ultra-liberal economics (Mises Institute) is not American either, it only found there a fertile ground to thrive. And, finally, we must bear in mind that some things were created in the USA, by Americans and to serve their specific goals. Some things associated with cultural imperialism result from the growth of capitalism. Homogenisation of products, for instance, is not an American \"value\" or style (though Andy Warhol seemed to think so, he was just an artist, not a social sciences researcher). It is a result of the pressure for cheaper means of production to increase profit (among other things). So we are left with the need to think about an alternative. What could we put in place of the English language to stop the mentioned negative effects of cultural imperialism? Easy answer: NOTHING WILL WORK because cultural imperialism results from imperialism proper. We cannot replace English while an English-speaking nation is the dominant power in the world. English has become so dominant because we have had two successive English-speaking empires  (Britain first, USA next). Before that the world had never seen such a long predominance of a single language since the Roman times. Hopeless answer: We have tried. We have Esperanto, which was created for that purpose. Had it succeded and we could have a neutral way to share information across cultures. One that would not be biased for American values and whatever. But Esperanto is mocked for its defects (which any language has, of course) and because it sounds strange (as any minority language does). One of the strongest criticisms is that it is not a natural language, which is like criticising Linux because it isn't Windows. Now, seriously: which natural language could replace English?  Tongue-in-cheek proposal: We should choose either Icelandic, Swahili or Guarani.  Icelandic is spoken by a tiny nation: they won't become imperialist in the foreseeable future. It may be a bit too difficult, though. It has its thorns, but it is beautiful to hear. Swahili is almost as neutral as Esperanto, as it is not specific to any country. It would also be great to give Africa a go: imagine how much tourism would increase in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda!  Guarani (http://www.iguarani.com) is also spoken by a tiny nation (Paraguay) but it is a bit easier than Icelandic (the Grammar is really sweet, with no plurals and no tenses, though the phonology sounds very weird, with all its consonantal changes and nasal vowels), especially if a better writing system is adopted. And it would be very funny to have football renamed to \"wakap\u00ed\"and the United States to \"Ipapyre Juaju\" (btw, \"Brazil\" is \"Pindorama\", which is funnier even). ",
