            "answer_text": "Using the Jews to gain power was a practical decision for many Nazis. It provided wealth, a unifying enemy for the German people to rally against and a scape goat for the severe problems Germany faced. After gaining power the persecution of the Jews severely harmed Germany. I will not go as far as saying they could have won the war if they had not persecuted Jews, but it would have almost certainly extended the war by at least a couple years and Germany might have been able to negotiate a peace treaty without having to surrender unconditionally. The effects of continued persecution of Jews were the loss of many talented people. Scientists in particular. Many engineers, scholars, and technically skilled Jews left Germany as well or were executed. To a lessor extent many talented Gypsies were also killed or driven out of Germany. Many of them after the Nazis came to power and the persecution against Jews intensified. Especially when rumors of the death camps began to circulate. The Nazis used extensive amounts of gas, filled trains that could have been used to transport raw materials or military supplies, wasted thousands of soldiers to round up and guard these concentration camp detainees and the camps themselves, thousands of SS to seek out and capture Jews in hiding. The massive manpower involved in the effort was a huge waste. More so Jews, Gypsies and many of the others who were rounded up could have served as soldiers themselves. Germany executed at least 1 million potential soldiers, many of them would have fought valiantly to prove they were as German as anybody else. Just the paperwork and army of clerks involved with the Holocaust was a huge drain on German resources. Many of the Jews who were executed would have provided extensive labor for the Nazis. The worst damage was the massive oppression felt everywhere. The taking of French Jews alienated 3 or 4 people for every French person that backed the idea. The holocaust prevented the assimilation of the French, which again cost the Germans dearly in terms of troops, as well as spurring on the French resistance which might have died off if not for the Holocaust. Poland, Ukraine and other nations the same story. This of course assumes a sort of amnesty for Jews where they were given a chance to demonstrate their patriotism and earn their way back into good graces. Something most German Jews would have done as Germany had a culture at the time which strongly promoted duty to nation and Jewish culture was built around riding the waves of oppression. This amnesty would have motivated the vast majority of Jews in Germany to be good workers and soldiers as long as the Nazis kept their word and restored position and wealth to Jews. The Nazis however would have still faced a 2 front war and the industrial might of the US. The US alone would have eventually toppled the Nazis. It just would have taken years longer and the Nazis might have worn down the British enough to accept a treaty where they kept parts of France, Poland, etc in exchange for disarming and ending the war. The US would have accepted this sort of arrangement if there were no concentration camps to liberate. This would have also meant a successful assassination of Hitler. Something Goebels or Goering could have likely arranged and if they saw the advantage of such would have. Hitler would have never accepted terms. The longer the war drew on the more delusional Hitler became. This was the best the Nazis could hope for when the US entered the war. Himmler would have had to either been on board or also eliminated along with his upper level staff. ",

            "answer_text": "I cannot believe there are so many negative answers, despite the fact that it\u2019s been discussed in quite a few places by better educated people. Here I\u2019m drawing primarily from Samuel Newland\u2019s essay (from Amazon.com: If the Allies Had Fallen: Sixty Alternate Scenarios of World War II (9781616085469): Harold C. Deutsch, Dennis E. Showalter, William R. Forstchen: Books) If you broaden Hitler\u2019s persecution of the \u201cJews\u201d to Hitler\u2019s persecution of \u201cvirtually every race on the planet that wasn\u2019t Aryan,\u201d then not only would refraining from persecution have won Hitler the war, it probably would have been the deciding factor that actually allowed Germany to defeat the Soviet Union. Below is the position of German troops two months after the invasion in 1941.  Here\u2019s an example of how the local population treated the invading Nazis.  You had a large population that had been, in most cases, unwillingly incorporated into a brutal totalitarian state. In places like the Ukraine, you already had a famine-tooled Holocaust, the Holodomor. They could have worked and served in the German war machine, and many of them did. Newland notes that somewhere between 1 and 3 million Soviets served with the Germans against the USSR, despite a lack of official policy, sanction, or even, in many cases, proper equipment (let alone respect from most German soldiers). Members of Hitler\u2019s staff, such as General Jodl, suggested the following of a \u201cliberation\u201d script to allow the incorporation of even more. When Smolensk fell to Germany, city leaders even offered to spearhead a movement to raise an army to march on the rest of the USSR (they were ignored). So\u2026imagine, a few months after the invasion, the Germans have: At least several hundred thousand former Soviet soldiers with themMuch more equipment and clothing suitable to the Russian winterAbsolutely no worries about actions to the rearA pipeline of future soldiers to help staunch rising German casualtiesA fully supportive labor force along their supply linesIt is fair to say that Operation Barbarossa would have ended with a different victor. \u2026however, thanks to Hitler\u2019s insistence that Slavs were members of \u201cinferior races\u201d and a stubborn belief in \u201cLebensraum,\u201d this plan simply wouldn\u2019t do. Rather, Nazis drew up a different plan, called Generalplan Ost, on how many of each of these former Soviet states would be eliminated. The below table from Wikipedia says it all:  So, yes, persecution and bigotry no doubt cost Hitler the war. Not just against the Jews, but against all people. But, to paraphrase Samuel Newland, if Hitler had welcomed other races with open arms, he wouldn\u2019t have been Hitler. EDIT - New personal Upvote record. Nice. However, this isn\u2019t my day job and I cannot take the time to comment and/or argue on the Internet. I\u2019ve provided sources for the hard statistics (including years of work Newman spent calculating Soviet unofficial involvement); please visit your local library. EDIT. My first 1K answer! Thanks! There have been some complaints that this answer doesn't address the question since the question addressed Jews specifically, and I insisted on expanding to that all races persecuted by the Nazis. To that, my answer is a single sentence: Hitler did not know what a Jew was. Read that sentence, ponder it, meditate on it, and remind yourself of it whenever you hear about the racial genocides of WWII. ",
