            "answer_text": "At the undergraduate level, not really. Anthropology literally means the study of humans, and since there is more than one way to do this, it is divided into four main fields: Archaeology Archaeology is the field with which you are likely most familiar. Excavation sites, Indiana Jones (minus the artifact theft), that type of thing. It is the study of humans through material culture, or that which is physically left behind after death. This can be anything from a tomb to a stone tool to the ruins of an ancient village. Biological Anthropology Biological anthropology is the study of humans through the lense of biology. Biological variation, evolution, skeletal analysis. Recently, biological anthropologists have started working with primatologists to help get a better idea of the behavior and social organization of the earliest humans. One of the difficulties here is with race, biology, and forensic anthropology, which can be considered the epitome of biological anthropology. The difficulty is that a forensic anthropologist\u2019s goal is to identify skeletal remains in order for police to solve the murder. It isn\u2019t helpful if all you know is that the victim was 5\u203210, male, and had broken his arm during his life. It does help to know whether he was black or white, but identifying this at the skeletal level implies biological difference (therefore hierarchy) between races, and gives biological validation to the concept of race. Linguistic Anthropology Linguistic anthropology is the study of humans through language. For example, the Navajo are related to the Inuit because the languages of both peoples belong to the Athabaskan language family. This also gives validation to the Bering Land Bridge theory. Linguistic anthropology also looks at things such as performatives. One performative is getting married. There is a definitely a change once the priest (or otherwise significant figure) says \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife (spouse and spouse, if you prefer)\u201d in that now the two people are married, but all that actually occurred was that the person spoke a few words. One important distinction in linguistic anthropology is that a society is a group of organisms that work together, such as termites, and culture is a set of behavior shared by a society. Cultural Anthropology Cultural anthropology is anthropology in the most classical sense. It is the study of human culture. Symbols, myths, rituals, religions, taboos, subsistence strategies, family structure, gender roles, division of labor, that type of thing. Realistically, social anthropology is just an interchangable term for cultural anthropology. At my university, the major is called Sociocultural Anthropology. These are the four main fields, but there are subfields that intermingle them, such as forensic archaeology, medical anthropology, indigenous anthropology, zooarchaeology, etc. Edit: Sociology cares that James is the King, as opposed to a peasant or lord or something. Social psychology cares that it is James who is King, rather than Bob or Chet. Cultural anthropology cares that James\u2019 society is a monarchy. ",

            "answer_text": "Social anthropolgy tends to focus more on how society structures. And how people evolve and behave within social structures. It\u2019s kind of like sociology. Social Anthropology studies how society structures affect culture. How the systems that rule a particular society will influence it\u2019s cultural methods and ideologies. For example, how a government structure might effect the farming practices. Cultral anthrolopy is the study of individual cultures. It usually involves more ethnology than social anthropology and is usually more focused on using artifacts or living people to understand how a societies cultural perceptions, (ideas about family, marriage, clothing styles, religious preferences). I studied cross cultral funeral rituals for the funeral home I was planning on opening in order to be able to offer more traditional ceremonies to the many different cultural communities spread throughout the Pacific Northwest.
