            "answer_text": "Alladurg village is located in Alladurg Tehsil of Medak district in Telangana, India. It is situated 56km away from district headquarter Alladurg. Alladurg is the \t\tsub-district headquarter of Alladurg village. One of the most intriguing things about Alladurg is the presence of Bethalaswamy temple, the only temple dedicated to the demon god very similar to the Bethala temple of Kondagattu in Karimnagar district. Renuka Yellamma temple is another jewel in the crown of Alladurg. There is a committee of priests who take turns every year to serve the Goddess and they get to keep the offerings which come in the form of gold and cash in huge quantities. Priests (both men and women in a family) come from as far as Maharashtra and Karnataka come to serve and make money year after year. Prehistoric rock paintings very similar to that of Ajanta and Ellora caves dating back to 2nd century BC have been excavated from Alladurg and preserved in the State Archaeological Museum in Hyderabad. There is also a megalithic burial site discovered in Alladurg mandal, confirming the settlement of humans in early history thriving here. Influence of Jainism (before the onset of Shaivism cult) could also be seen in Allladurg, as sculptures of Lord Mahavir which were found inside the Hanuman temple lay neglected outside the temple now. None of these temples fall under the Endowments Department and the revenue from the jataras and the temples is shared by the priests and the landlord on whose land Bethalaswamy temple is located. Bagaiah, the priest at Bethala temple feels that Endowments Department taking over the temple would assure steady income to the priests and could be useful for developing the temples in Alladurg. The same was reiterated by priests in Hanuman and Veerabhadraswamy temple. One of the interesting things about Alladurg is the fort where the landlords still live. Centuries ago, there was a saint named Allah Wali Shah who propagated Islam, leading a life of wisdom and serving people. He had a servant named Ramdas, whom he gave all his property including the fort before he had died. A dargah was built in Alladurg in Allah Wali Shah\u2019s memory and Alladurg was named after him. After Ramdas, several generations later, E Laxma Reddy inherited the fort and property. Currently, E Anil Kumar Reddy owns the fort and Bethalaswamy temple also falls in his property. The fort still stands tall as a witness to rising and falling kingdoms, transitioning into a feudal system. According to researchers, after the formation of Andhra Pradesh in 1956, manipulations were done with the naksha (maps) of Nizam and reorganisation of land records (ROR) was done by landlords. Alladurg is renowned for its temples, the main ones are Yellamma Temple, Bethala Swamy Temple (with a Jathara in April each year). Devotees from Hyderabad, Naded and other places in Maharastra regularly come to see the Yellamma Temple. In Alladurg you will find many rocks and stones, which are belongs of olden days. Yellamma mata is known as Silamkot matta, she is kulaswamini of savji samaj. Other name of Alladurg is Silamkota. The main employment of the people is agriculture and business. It is a very typical place to visit. The Sri Renuka Yellamma temple in the historic Alladurg village in Medak district draws devotees from across states. Another unique feature of Alladurg, also called Silamkota, is that it houses a temple for Betala Swamy (Betaludu), the demon king. Alladurg has many sculptures, some strewn across the village, besides ruined monuments and neglected structures. Situated 120 km from Hyderabad, the village is a treasure trove of history where traces of Jainism, Shaivisim, Vaishnavism and the Mughal reign can be found. Pre-historic rock paintings of 2nd century were also found in the village. Besides the presiding deity Renuka Yellamma, whose footsteps are engraved in granite, Alladurg has a Shiva temple, temples for Veerabhadraswamy, Nandi, Betaludu, an array of snake gods with single, three and five hoods and Veeranjaneyaswamy, to name a few, are found in the village. Annual jataras of Renuka Yellamma and Betaludu are quite famous. The Chalukyan king Tribhuvanamalladeva Vikramaditya VI's chieftain Ahavamalla Permanadi held sway over the area. He reportedly donated land for the maintenance of a Jain temple called Jinalaya and his subordinate, Dandanayak Chillamadeva, gifted land to the temple of Chillesvara Deva built by him. Mr Md Abdul Waheed Khan, a former director of archaeology and museums in undivided AP, wrote books in 1968 on the history of Alladurg and the mural paintings by Kalyani Chalukyas. Before the Western Chalukyas of Kalyani, the village was within the domain of the Chalukyas of Vemulavada who ruled from Karimnagar from 825 AD to 950 AD. The rulers called themselves Chalukyas and adopted the titles as well. The Kakatiyas and Bahmanis had influence over Alladurg as is evident from the architecture of a mosque in the village. It is said that during the Bahmani rule, the village was gifted to a saint, Allah Wali Shah, who subsequently handed it over to the Deshmukh family. The grave of the saint lies in the village besides those of the kin of the Deshmukhs. Renuka Yellamma's idol is beautifully carved in black basalt. The diety is seated in the Lalitasana posture and carries a bowl in the left hand and, probably, a sword in the right. In fulfillment of their vows, devotees present toddy to the goddess, which is also taken as \"theertham\". Animal sacrifice is rampant despite a ban. The temple is privately-run. Hereditary pujaris manage the temple in turns every year and share the donations. \"The village has rich historical past and the heritage department had made studies on it, preserved some of the sculptures and murals. Three mural paintings are in the State Museum at Public Garden,\" said Mr S.S. Rangacharyulu, retired deputy director, TS department of heritage. Many ancient sculptures and artefacts have come to light during tilling of land, digging for construction of house and other projects in the village and its surroundings. In 1967, Laxma Reddy and Ranga Reddy, the Deshmukhs, found a pit and columns of an old temple while tilling land near the village tank. The department immediately took up exploration. Officials found a toranam or gateway like the one in Kolanupaka and Warangal fort. On one of the columns was engraved the name of Sri Tribhuvana Malla Deva, the famous Chalukyan king of Kalyani. It was dated to the ninth year of the Chalukya Vikrama era, corresponding to 1084 AD. According to Mr Pujari Ramakrishna, who made a video on the Renuka Yellamma temple and Alladurg, the village could be turned into a historically important place by preserving and renovating the temples and sculptures.
