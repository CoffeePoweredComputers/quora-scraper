            "answer_text": "This is a very complicated question to answer. It\u2019s both nature and nurture. There\u2019s genetics that plays a role in the brain function. A gene called APOE4 has been associated with Alzheimer\u2019s and memory in general. It regulates the receptors in the hippocampus, a region known for turning short-term memory to long-term ones. But it\u2019s more than just your genetics. Epigenetics is a thing for a reason. When we remember a piece of information, we reconstruct sensory information and experience it the way we stored it. There are also different types of memories. When a piece of information fires down constantly in certain pathways and through the hippocampus, neurotransmitters are binding to the \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor, known as AMPAR and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor also known as the NMDAR. The latter helps in long term potentiation, which is responsible for your brain\u2019s ability to learn. The more the neurons fire, the more the receptors are triggered and eventually certain proteins and enzymes make additional AMPAR and NMDAR receptors along the neuron\u2019s membrane making it more sensitive to future signals, thus easier to remember. This part is the nurture part. This part is what you can improve. As you can see, the mechanism is quite easy; use the information. There\u2019s no secret or magic to it. You can use many techniques to remember, associate things with one another. Another thing that plays a role is the emotional impact of information. When an event is emotional the amygdala is activated - so is the hippocampus - and this dual activation makes the memory stronger. The activation of both makes the synapses stronger and therefore the connections as well ",

            "answer_text": "Because they\u2019re not even self - aware that they should be training it. How many times, when you put your keys down, do you mind to create a mental markers, so you\u2019ll able to find that object afterwards? Put your keys next to a phone - that big red old - timer phone:  The more awkwardness and vivid or long - anchored memories, the better. Another clue to answer your question would be to ask - how do you quantify on that question? You know some people might remember people\u2019s names worship-fully, but they lack the memory capacity when remembering the years of events happened in history. It\u2019s the filters we have implanted in our brains. I remember stuff around business category much easier than culture or sports. Why? Because my brain is emotionally wired that way. I breathe and live business, that\u2019s why. So, in the summary, I would take these two explanations to answer your question: Because they\u2019re not doing anything with their memory, they run on auto - pilot - you can change this and influence itFilters - as described aboveIf you want you can check my course\u2019s section 3 to see what you can do with your memory to start working with it. https://inex.life/product/inex-results-oriented-learning/ ",
