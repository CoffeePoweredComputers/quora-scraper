            "answer_text": "How was the picture taken of the first camera known? A picture was never take of the first known camera. That\u2019s because the first known camera was happened upon, that is, discovered, not built. Oh, and it was never recorded as happening. But it did. And it happened along these lines: A tribe of nomadic hunter-gatherers happened upon a system of caverns in their travels that included a chamber that just happened to have a fairly flattish, fairly light-colored wall opposite an exterior wall that just happened to have a hole in the opposite wall that faced an exterior scene that, once the nomads stumbled upon the cave, turned out to project an upside down image of that exterior scene. This primitive camera obscura formed spontaneously, just as any number of such formation have occurred across time, whether human beings were aware of it or not. Any combination of a human in a fairly dark enclosure with a fortuitous hole in roughly the right place will produce a pin-hole camera. So while no one knows the first time a human noticed a camera - it has to have happened over and over and over across time - there would have been no secondary cameras to take a picture, mainly because there would have been no recording medium available to capture an image. Now, once a way to record an image was developed (sorry) cameras were already a mature technology with lenses and groundglass for focus, etc. So when the first combination of recording media and camera was made, it was all the inventor could do to eke out a fuzzy image of a sun-drenched building, much less the camera itself. But really. OP couldn\u2019t imagine pointing an early camera at a mirror? ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming you are referring to the camera used to expose the first enduring photographic image and not a camera obscura used by artists in the 18th century. A picture of the first camera could have been taken by many different cameras that followed it including my Minolta SRT 101. The camera was on display at the Musee de Niepce in Chalon, France when I visited there in 1999. The lighting wasn\u2019t very good and the slide I took isn\u2019t worth scanning. ",
