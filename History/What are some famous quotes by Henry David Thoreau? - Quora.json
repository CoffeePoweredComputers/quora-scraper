            "answer_text": "Here are some of my favorite Thoreau quotes: I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor. I asked myself why I might not be washing some gold daily, though it were only the finest particles, \u2014 why I might not sink a shaft down to the gold within me, and work that mine. If the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy, and life emits a fragrance like flowers and sweet-scented herbs, is more elastic, more starry, more immortal \u2014 that is your success. A little relaxation in your exertion, a little idleness, will let in sickness and death into your body From exertion come wisdom and purity; from sloth ignorance and sensuality. Life consists with wildness. The most alive is the wildest. Not yet subdued to man, its presence refreshes him. It is strange that men are in such haste to get fame as teachers rather than knowledge as learners. Nothing can be more useful to a man than the determination not to be hurried. If I am visited by a thought, I chew that cud each successive morning, as long as there is any flavor in it. The most attractive sentences are, perhaps, not the wisest, but the surest and roundest. They are spoken firmly and conclusively, as if the speaker had a right to know what he says, and if not wise, they have at least been well learned. Our orators might learn much from the Indians. They are remarkable for their precision; nothing left at loose ends. A man had better starve at once than lose his innocence in the process of getting his bread. At any rate, I might pursue some path, however solitary and narrow and crooked, in which I could walk with love and reverence. It is remarkable that there is little or nothing to be remembered written on the subject of getting a living: how to make getting a living not merely honest and honorable, but altogether inviting and glorious; for if getting a living is not so, then living is not. Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away. It is not important that he should mature as soon as an apple tree or an oak. Shall he turn his spring into summer? When we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence, that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality. The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it. If I am not I, who will be? You think that I am impoverishing myself withdrawing from men, but in my solitude I have woven for myself a silken web or chrysalis, and, nymph-like, shall ere long burst forth a more perfect creature, fitted for a higher society. Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth. I sat at a table where were rich food and wine in abundance, and obsequious attendance, but sincerity and truth were not; and I went away hungry from the inhospitable board. Any sincere thought is irresistible. ",
