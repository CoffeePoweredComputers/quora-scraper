            "answer_text": " Emperor Charles V visiting the wounded King Francis after the Battle of Pavia That would have been bad form and Charles V was a true gentleman and trusted Francis I on his word.  Emperor Charles V and Empress Isabella The King promised the Emperor to yield Burgundy which the Emperor wanted as it was the realm of his ancestors: Duke Charles the Bold , his great-grandfather and Duchess Marie, his paternal grandmother..  But the King, who suffered from an unmentionable disease, went back on his word and probably committed purgery.. With Papal sanction too!  King Francis I of France and his sister Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, one of the few persons he truly loved.. If Charles had not been a good Joe he would have France denuded of its entire East, taking back the Dauphin\u00e9 and the Provence too! And as for the bishop of Rome #$%^&*(  Sorry but the final Valois royals are simply terrible people.. ",
