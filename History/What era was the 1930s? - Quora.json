            "answer_text": "Generally the 1930s is the Great Depression era where the world's economy had collapsed following the 1929 Wall Street Crash. It is generally considered a time of great suffering in America, Britain and much of Europe. However regions of Britain did prosper due to new industries like engineering, I say Britain as it's what I've studied. Also it can be seen as an era of totalitarian regimes and the rise of facism in Europe such as Hitler's Germany, Mussolini's Italy, Franco's Spain. Stalin was also in full swing as Soviet leader and was implementing what would become to be known as Stalinism. I hope this helps answer your question. ",
