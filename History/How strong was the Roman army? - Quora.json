            "answer_text": "When? The Western Roman Civilization lasted from approximately 700 B.C.E. until 478 C.E.. They became an Empire in 44 B.C.E.. That is over a thousand years of history. The Eastern Roman Empire continued on until 1453 C.E., which extends the duration of Roman civilization to two thousand years. Throughout that long epoch the Roman forces were sometimes strong and sometimes weak. They used many different weapons configurations and many different tactical doctrines. They uniforms and appearance changed several times. If you are going to ask questions about Romans, you have to specify when within their very long history you are talking about. In comparison, the United States has been in existence for so-far less than 300 years. However, if you ask \u201cWhat did a Soldier of the U.S. Army look like?\u201d that question would also be unanswerable. A soldier in the U.S. Army during the Revolution looked different from one during the War of 1812, who looked different from one during the American Civil War, who looked different form one in the First World War, who looked different from one in the Second World War, etc. etc. Romans went through a similar amount of change, but for an even longer time. This is part of what makes Roman history so cool: there is SO MUCH of it. Welcome to the world of people interested in Roman history. There are a lot of us, and it is fun to bring someone up to speed. Don\u2019t feel bad about asking a poorly-phrased question. You didn\u2019t know any better, yet. Now you do. Your next questions will be better, and after that you will ask even better questions. Welcome to the path! As a really good broad over-view, try listening to The History of Rome podcast by Mike Duncan. The first few episodes are somewhat rough, but they get better. This represents around 150 hours of listening, and Mike has a great voice, so I think that you will enjoy. ",
