            "answer_text": "This is the beginning of a wikipedia page on this subject: The Pan-Arab colors are black, white, green, and red. Individually, each of the four Pan-Arab colors were intended to represent a certain Arab dynasty, or era. The black was the Abbasid dynastic color; white was the Umayyad dynastic color; green was the Fatimid dynastic color; and red was the Hashemite dynastic color. The four colors derived their potency from a verse by 14th century Iraqi poet Safi al-Din al-Hilli: \"White are our acts, black our battles, green our fields, and red our swords\". I would like to add: The \u201cPalestinians\u201d see themselves as brothers of the Jordanians. And only took down the star of the Jordanian flag when the Arab world decides in 1964/8 that frontal nation war to destroy Israel was not successful and that only a \u201cpopular u[rising of the \u201cpeople\u201dwould do the job of destroying Israel. In principle it is the same flag ",

But there\u2019s one better: This is the flag of Palestine:  [math]\\ [/math] And this is the flag of the Ba\u02bdath Party:  The only difference between the two is that the Ba\u2019ath flag uses a 2:3 ratio as opposed to the Palestine flag's 1:2 Oh, and this is the flag of the short lived Hashemite Arab Federation:  All of these flags, as well as Jordan\u2019s and several others, draw their inspiration from the flag of the Arab Revolt (1916\u20131918) against Ottoman rule, which looked like this:  BONUS: The order of Palestine flag stripes, as shown on stamps and insignia are sometimes black-white-green and sometimes green-white-black. When the flag is shown horizontally, black is always up, but when it\u2019s vertical it can be either way. Here are examples of two stamps issued by the Palestinian authority in 1996 with swapped color order.  ",

The reason both flags use similar patterns and colours is because they have similar sources of inspiration. Their source of inspiration isthe flag of the 1917 revolt against the Ottoman Empire. Other Arab nations also draw their inspiration from it.  ",

            "answer_text": "Almost every Arab flag has some combination of red, green, black and white. Green and white were the colours of the Omayyad Caliphate, the founders of Sunni Islam (hence the green and white flag of KSA, which, in the name of Sunni Islam, controls the Holy cities (Mecca, Medina). Green was also the colour of the Shiite Fatimid dynasty, and is also the flag of Hezbollah (on a yellow not white background). Black was the color of the Abbasid Caliphate, and if i recall correctly, of the Ayyubid (founded by Saladin) one as well, which is why ISIS chose a black flag. Red was the colour of the Hashemite dynasty, which for centuries held the office of Shariff of Mecca and Medina - keeper of the holy places, by virtue of their being direct bloodline descendants of Mohammed. Red symbolizes the blood of Muslim martyrs who died in the name of Islam, hence the colour of whoever controls the Holy Cities. That\u2019s why the Turkish flag is red and white, as the Ottoman Empire ruled the area for over 4 centuries. ",
