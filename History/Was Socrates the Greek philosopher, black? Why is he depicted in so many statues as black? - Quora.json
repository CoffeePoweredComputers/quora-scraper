            "answer_text": "Even if it is true, delusional Eurocentrists will post fake statues and frescoes. The ancient and medieval history of Europe has been whitewashed in order to erase all the iconic figures and legendary rulers who were not white. Check Delphos, the oracle and royal of Delphi, an island in southern Greece. Check Roman Emperor Macrinus, a Berber. Check Saint Adrian, the African, the Bishop of Canterburry in England in the 8th. Check Pope Victor, a Berber. Check Saint Maurice, the Theban, the Patron Saint of the Holy Roman Empire. History will always conjure its way through the cracks of fallacy and hidden information. I have been asking white supremacists for a believable explanation for the very peculiar European tradition of the Crowned Moor heraldic symbol. The symbol depicts a black man with a crown and a golden earring on crests, coats of arms and castle walls and frescoes. Royals live in castles. Royals wear crowns. Who is the black king ? ",

            "answer_text": "Socrates was an Athenian citizen that meant he had to have two Athenian parents so unless one pretend that all Ancient Greek were black, he was of Greek Mediterranean type , he was actually described as quite ugly snub nose as seen in this statue protruding eyes and pot belly, though physically strong , and no mean warrior, however no where is he described as black either in Xenophon or Plato writings or in the play clouds which made fun of him during his own life coal black skin would have been noticed. I have pretty much read everything about Socrates written in ancient world and no where is described as black or having any connection with Africa or Africans. The basis for this claim this statue Emphasises the snub nose. Case closed ",
