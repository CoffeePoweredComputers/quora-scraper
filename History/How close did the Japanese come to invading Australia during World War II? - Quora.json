            "answer_text": "H.P. Wilmott\u2019s book, The Barrier and the Javelin: Japanese and Allied Pacific Strategies February to June 1942 cover this subject. Read from page 39 onwards. In summary, the Japanese Navy wanted to invade Australia (for obvious reasons). But it needed the cooperation of the Army. But the Japanese\u2019s Army main focus was to conquer China which it had been struggling to do since the 1930s. If America hadn\u2019t cut its oil sales to Japan and imposed economic sanctions against Japan, Japan would have carried on just fighting China alone. Anyhow, Japan Army\u2019s answer was Maybe NO. The Army especially did not like being distracted from their main priority, i.e., conquering China. That was its main focus, not Australia which they considered a distraction. Attacking Burma, Malaya, Dutch East Indies and Philippines was part of a misguided plan to build a defense perimeter to enable them to secure their prime objective, China. The Army staff argued they didn\u2019t have the troops or supplies needed for this conquest. The Army also doubted whether the Navy was up to the task of ferrying and supplying the Army. This was proven in the Battle of the Coral Sea. FYI, the Japanese Army and Navy were extremely hostile to each other, viewing each other as rivals. Having said that, if the Japanese Navy had not been blunted by the American Navy in the Battle of Coral Sea, (including Midway and Guadalcanal,) it is possible that a more stronger invasion plan might have been worked out. That is to say, if the Americans had sat back in Pearl Harbor and San Francisco sandbagging and did absolutely nothing west of Oahu from December 7th, 1941, even the Japanese Army might have been tempted to take a bite out of Australia. Critics of the idea forget that the Japanese did not need to occupy Australia. The Japanese Army was ruthless. Haven\u2019t you heard what they did to Nanking? They slaughtered 100,000 civilians after the city surrendered. They could have marched down the Eastern seaboard raping, murdering civilians and destroying factories, homes and cities like Sherman\u2019s Southward march. This would have had a devastating effect on Australia. Thankfully at the Battle of Coral Sea and Midway, the Japanese Navy was stopped by the American Navy.  Source:  ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, not that close at all, despite the rather terrifying appearances of the campaign map, not to mention Australian propaganda. To begin with, Australia was rather slow to mobilize in WWII because the War with Germany just wasn\u2019t very popular. Much like the U.S. during the same period, Australia was experiencing a popular feeling of isolationism, and there were undertones of working-class opposition that, by turns, displayed both socialist and ultra right-wing tendencies. Rather belatedly, mobilization accelerated when the population became more aware of the threat posed by Japan, and the Government was able to exploit the sudden Japanese conquest of Southeast Asia to work mobilization efforts up to a fever pitch. It may have been propaganda, but it was what needed to be done at the time, and it worked. With the Japanese closing in on Port Moresby, Darwin and other locations in Australia being bombed, submarines probing the approaches to Sydney harbor, etc., things no doubt seemed dire. Prudently, the Allied authorities assumed the worst, as they had come to expect (and get) the very worst from Hitler and the Nazis. But there was one major hitch: invading Australia had never figured into Japan\u2019s long-term strategic plans for what they hoped would be a short, limited war in the Pacific. What the Japanese hoped was that the U.S. would sue for peace, and that they could simply take the European colonies in Southeast Asia - French Indochina, British Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies. For the Japanese, the \u201creal war\u201d was in China; that\u2019s where the bulk of their troops were committed. When it seemed as if Australia was \u201cwide open\u201d to invasion, the Japanese high command did briefly consider the idea, and they very quickly set it aside. To begin with, the ANZACs in New Guinea showed surprising resilience, and the attempt to capture Port Moresby didn\u2019t go as well as the Japanese had hoped. In fact, it became a muddy, bloody quagmire, literally. They also made the very grave mistake of placing too many troops on New Britain, who were eventually bottled up, there, and starved into submission, contributing almost nothing to the Japanese war effort. Isolating the New Britain garrison was one of the biggest \u201cunsung\u201d Allied successes of the Pacific War. It was one of the most influential battles that never happened, beyond the bombing campaign. As for actually invading Australia, that would have required the Japanese to fight in desert terrain that was totally unknown to them - never a good idea. The closest thing to desert the Japanese Army had ever dealt with was the Manchurian and Mongolian fronts, against the USSR, and that hadn\u2019t gone very well. The Japanese also would have faced an Australian force, on home ground, well-supplied with artillery and tanks. The Japanese forces that had invaded Southeast Asia were not very heavily equipped, and certainly could not have sustained widespread operations (a reminder, here, that Australia is about the same size as the lower 48 states of the U.S.), long desert supply lines, or engagements with a better-equipped and highly-motivated opponent. The Japanese high command was smart enough to consider all this, realize that invading Australia was folly, and immediately set it aside as an impossible task. ",
