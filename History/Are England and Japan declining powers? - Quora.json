            "answer_text": "Technically, yes, but for very different reasons. Japan of course, got pounded to rubble during WWII. But then it was viewed as a necessary ally by the USA during two long wars in Asia. The US military spent billions on purchases from Japanese industry because it was cheaper to buy it there than ship it from the USA. Not military gear, but a huge number of industrial goods needed by soldiers and their families. And Japan violated pretty much every patent they could find and built up their high-tech industry on stolen patents, which the USA winked at. Now, those days are over and Japanese industry has to stand on its own. Well, that\u2019s a lot harder and Japan is returning to its status as a hard working, well-educated and industrialized nation, but just one competitor on the world stage. England is paying the price for two decisions made decades ago. First, WWII. Now, I am glad that England stood up and fought Nazi Germany, but it paid an enormous price for it. England\u2019s lost only 1% of it\u2019s population to the war, but its economy was completely transformed and virtually bankrupted. But then the Labour government got in(1945) and Keynesian policies were followed with nationalization of several major industries and the creation of the cradle to grave welfare system. The Conservatives left most of this in place until Thatcher decades later. These changes killed individual incentive, virtually ended growth and allowed rife mismanagement. England shed it\u2019s empire sometimes well, others not well. England just now seems to be recovering from decades of poor decisions. ",

            "answer_text": "First, let's put things in perspective.  Japan has been having a so called lost two decades - so let's see how the world was doing 20 years back.   Japan was having a merry time even though the crash of the bubble economy was starting to take hold.  It was the first year when it became really hard for a fresh graduate to land a job.  US was on the roll.  This new \"dot com\" thing was going to change the world.  The Cold War was no more, and the world was going into an age of utopian prosperity under market lead democracies, end of civilization and all that.  China was still the dirt ridden outback of the world, where only the brave ventured dreaming of wealth, but there was no telling how long the communists were going to remain accommodating.  EU experiment was still starting.  Border gatehouses were getting abolished across he continent, Euro was in the process of being gradually introduced, and the economic windfall from the common currency regions were going to bring Europe into a power that can even surpass the US.   UK was going steady, but still struggling to come to terms with Thatcherite forced transformation from a colonial and industrial power to a hub of financial services. Russia was torpedoed and sunk.  It's economy in tatters, it still innocently believed the West could ride to their rescue.  The Ruble stopped functioning and people were being paid in commodities.   Brazil was still considered a place that had a big rainforest and grew bananas, in most people's consciousness.   ASEAN was - well, starting to happen.  Gradually.   What I mean to convey here is the folly of looking at the trajectory of the last 20 years and assume the same line will continue to stretch out for a hundred years.  It won't.  Imagine asking yourself the same question back then, and see if you would have got it right.  I certainly didn't. ",
