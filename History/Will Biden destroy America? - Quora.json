            "answer_text": "No. If he does become president, he will simply be a continuation of what has been, essentially another Obama administration. Biden himself cannot destroy America, and neither can Trump. Regardless who becomes the next president, the fact is, that it is not the president who will destroy America. If America does collapse under Biden, it won't be his fault, but rather the fruits of seeds sowed decades ago. What do I mean? All the destructive policies in place were implemented decades ago, or even more than 100 years ago. The corruption we see in the US government? Not the fault of Obama or Trump, or even Bush, but rather, the product of decades of growing authoritarian rule. Look at all the problems that exist in America. Debt, ever-increasing, neverendingEndless warfareMass surveillanceMassive spending on independent federal agencies that pass laws, and are a law unto themselves. They are operated by unelected bureaucrats who can pass laws at whim, and have no accountability.Massive spending in general by the federal government. Social Security, Medicare, Military, you name it. Everything. The federal government should only be 5% of what it is now.Income taxMass incarcerationMass violations of civil liberties (in the face of the fake COVID-19 pandemic and 9/11 attacks). The US government can literally detain people without trial, and has fined citizens for going to the beach, opening their businesses.Education systemAll these problems were down decades ago. In fact, if you look at it, the United States is on the verge of becoming a totalitarian police state. The government is literally teetering on the brink of becoming out of control, and it is only a matter of time. Its pending is out of control. Its debt. Its warfare state. Welfare state. Everything. The government is getting increasingly out of control, and who's at fault? The people, for too many generations. The US has allowed its monetary system to be hijacked by an unelected Federal Reserve Bank, which prints money from thin air, and controls the money supply through inflation and destroys the value of the US Dollar. In effect, the Federal Reserve, a group of unelected elites, are controlling the money supply and thus, the economy. The Central Bank has threatened the country since its birth and inception. Mass amounts of money get printed out of nothing. The government spends mass amounts of money. Mass amounts, as in billions of dollars. Welfare programs, military, war, national security, and regardless of how you feel, I don't think the US Federal Government has to get involved in everything! Especially not when it spends mass amounts of citizens tax dollars. All ears fought since WWII have been illegal. Illegal. Article 1 Section 8 gives Congress the power to declare war, but there has not been a single declaration of war since WWII. The American people have literally lost control of their own armed forces. Military use is literally out of control. What I mean is (I say this for every country, including my country, Canada, which is in many ways, worse than the US) that we, the people of the Western World, have lost control of everything. Everything. Our governments are effectively being run by elitists, by globalists, who care nothing about the people, but rather exist to push the agenda of the elites. Our governments recklessly spend mass amounts of money on foreign aid, military, welfare, education, security, all for what? They raise taxes on average citizens and use tax dollars to bail out corporations. Citizens have literally lost control of their own money and economy. Our national sovereignty is being surrendered by our leaders, especially Justin Trudeau. Our politicians exist to serve the interests of the elites. What we see here is the last, remaining bit of what's left. The reality is, unelected globalists are running the show. In essence, we have lost control of our governments. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s been destroyed for years. Hopefully we can start picking the pieces up. They say every third generation is the best generation, that would make millennials \u201cthe best generation\u201d after the silent generation and I do honestly believe it. I believe we will be the catalyst that solves global warming, the restructure of our countries culture, restructure to government offices and programs, elimination of institutionalized racism, improve international relations, improve quality of life, and lay the foundation for the us to get back to #1. With our desire for free education, the return on that investment will be an educated population who is able to drive results globally through business and proper ethics. Gen Z will then take our reigns, they will work hard, know how to be fiscally responsible and fine tune our philosophies and then if the rule continues, their kids will be the problem generation. Third generational rule states: First generation grows up in a hardship, they inherit their parents mess, they see their parents/country struggling and lay the building blocks to fix it. (Silent Gen and millennials) Second generation will see their parents hard work but life will be exponentially easier, they will have more resources readily available and won\u2019t be required to penny pinch as aggressively. (The lost generation and Baby boomers) Third generation will only know excess, they will not have the foundation that created the previous generations strength and won\u2019t leave the world in a better place. (Gen X and Gen Alpha) Then it starts over again. I believe our version of \u201cthe world in taters\u201d is the current fight against science, social justice, foreign and domestic relations, a ballooning debt and about a trillion other things. ",
