            "answer_text": "This answer pertains only to the psychological and sociological basis of nationalism.  It applies only indirectly to the political objectives and ramifications of nationalism. Humans evolved to form into groups of like minded individuals which then compete with other groups for scarce resources and political power. By \"like-minded\" it is meant that the members of the group share a set of values about the world; what it is and what it should be, and what is important and unimportant.  Those important things become \"sacred\" values, where \"sacred\" means only a core belief that is beyond questioning; a core truth from which other truths flow.  It does not have to be about religion.   These value sets go by different names, like ideology, morality, and religion, but they're all variations on the same underlying aspect of fundamental human nature, our \"groupishness.\" Nations can sometimes become sacred values around which people \"circle the wagons.\" This is admittedly only a partial answer to the question,  but it does, I think, offer some valid insight. For the science behind human groupishness, sacred values, etc., see \"The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided By Politics And Religion\" by Jonathan Haidt.       ",

            "answer_text": "You might consider the excellent Wikipedia Article on \"Nationalism\" and the many references that it cites, for a fuller answer. Here, copied from that article, is a summary answer to your question: Two major bodies of thought address the causes of nationalism:[2] the modernist perspective describes nationalism as a recent phenomenon that requires the structural conditions of modern society in order to existthe primordialist perspective describes nationalism as a reflection of the ancient evolutionary tendency of humans to organize into distinct groupings based on an affinity of birthRoger Masters in The Nature of Politics (1989) says that both the primordialist and modernist conceptions of nationalism involve an acceptance of three levels of common interest of individuals or groups in national identity at an inter-group level, humans respond to competition or conflict by organizing into groups to either attack other groups or defend their group from hostile groups[23] at the intragroup level, individuals gain advantage through cooperation with others in securing collective goods that are not accessible through individual effort alone[23] on the individual level, self-interested concerns over personal fitness by individuals either consciously or subconsciously motivate the creation of group formation as a means of security[23] The behaviour of leadership groups or \u00e9lites that involves efforts to advance their own fitness when they are involved in the mobilization of an ethnic or national group is crucial in the development of the culture of that group.[23]  ",
