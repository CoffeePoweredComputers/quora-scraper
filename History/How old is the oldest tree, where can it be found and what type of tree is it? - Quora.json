            "answer_text": "There are actually two contenders to the title \"The Oldest Tree\". - The non-clonal contender for the title is of a Great Northern Bristlecone Pine aged 5'063. Bristlecones grow in scattered subalpine groves at high altitude in arid regions of the Western United States. The pines live in isolated groves above the tree line on dolomitic soils (very alkaline soil). Because of cold temperatures, dry soils, high winds, and short growing seasons, the trees grow very slowly. Even the tree's needles, which grow in bunches of five, can remain on the tree for forty years, which gives the tree's terminal branches the unique appearance of a long bottle brush.     The wood is very dense and resinous, and thus resistant to invasion by insects, fungi, and other potential pests. The tree's longevity is due in part to the wood's extreme durability. While other species of trees that grow nearby suffer rot, bare bristlecone pines can endure, even after death, often still standing on their roots, for many centuries. Rather than rot, exposed wood, on living and dead trees, erodes like stone due to wind, rain, and freezing, which creates unusual forms and shapes. - The clonal contender to the title is Pando, a colony of 0.5 km2 of quaking aspen. While the average age of the stems is 130, it is connected by a complex web of roots, estimated to be 80'000 years old. Pando considered also to be the heaviest and the oldest living organism.
