            "answer_text": "This is a great question. The basic answer is \u201cyes\u201d, but the details are fascinating, because the world is shades of gray and not a simplistic \u201chero\u2019s journey\u201d. First up, who is \u201cSpain\u201d? Certainly we are referring to more than one person. Cort\u00e9s did indeed do something unheard of, but the interesting thing is: it wasn\u2019t his expedition to begin with. He was an \u201cHidalgo\u201d, which was a minor nobility. Athough he had been in war, he had been essentially officially an accountant in Cuba and had his job thanks to Diego Velazquez\u2019s favor in the first place. The expedition belonged to Velazquez, his boss, and Cort\u00e9s was merely in charge of it. If anything was conquered, technically, it as Velazquez\u2019s exploration and whatever found to be governed from Cuba, but it was meant to be mostly exploratory. But an interesting thing happened on the way there\u2026 With everything set up, Velazquez started noticing something: Cort\u00e9s was outfitting the expedition he was paying for to explore around \u201cthe island of Yucat\u00e1n\u201d (yes, they thought it was an island) with warriors, not explorers. This made him uneasy. Like there was something Cort\u00e9s wasn\u2019t saying. Uneasy enough that he decided to relieve his relative of command. The night Velazquez decided to relieve him of command, Cort\u00e9s went to the local farmer and bought every pig in Havana (yes, all of them). Way more provisions that he needed. Velazquez sent his emissary with the message relieving Cort\u00e9s of command. Who never came back. Cort\u00e9s left in the middle of the night. Velazquez\u2019s emissary was found later, dead. Yes. Cort\u00e9s, an \u201cHidalgo\u201d but not a higher noble, stole an entire expedition (and of course there\u2019s that \u201cprobable murder\u201d little issue). As soon as he arrived on Veracruz (some suspect he had acquired knowledge that there was something important going on if he went straight east and he just didn\u2019t tell his boss, others chalk it to good luck and research because he did go to the Yucat\u00e1n first), he got busy writing letters to carry favor with the King. These \u201cCartas de Relaci\u00f3n\u201d are in fact today an important historical document. Velazquez is, a you\u2019d expect, fuming. He gets Captain P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez to hastily put together another expedition to go capture him. These, note, take months to get ready. And it doesn\u2019t help that they\u2019re not cheap in the first place. By the time Narv\u00e1ez catches up to Cort\u00e9s\u2019 settlement of Veracruz Months later (remember, they don\u2019t necessarily know what Cort\u00e9s did or where he went), Cort\u00e9s was already in today\u2019s Mexico City. Narv\u00e1ez took over his settlement at Villa Rica by talking to the very few people there and explaining the situation. His instructions - and those of the government at Cuba - are to have him arrested as soon as he was back. In the middle of the night a few days later, Cort\u00e9s, leaving half of his crew in Mexico City where they are \u201cguests\u201d at the palace already, attacked his old boss\u2019s newest crew. He won. Narv\u00e1ez lost an eye and was captured. Cort\u00e9s gave the new expedition a choice. Join me and share in the riches, or be arrested. Either way, you\u2019re not coming back. We\u2019ll sort things out with Velazquez in time. Maybe. It\u2019s obvious what they would choose. Interestingly enough, I guess \u201cstealing the expedition\u201d (two of them now, in fact) puts in question the ownership of the lands conquered. If he took all this equipment from you and then used it to do something amazing that you may not have been able to, that amazing thing.. is it yours? If, when enforcing the law, you lose the fight, and then he becomes the ruler of a huge land, what exactly is your recourse? In his \u201cCartas de Relaci\u00f3n\u201d, Cort\u00e9s barely talks about this crime. He mostly talks about the amazing feats he\u2019s doing and his experiences. Which are indeed fascinating. Always, of course, in the name of Spain and the King and promising the cut as soon as he can send it (and he does). By the time he finishes the conquest, he is, as they say in modern times, \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. Also, a Cort\u00e9s was winning, Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s fortunes, which started, by the way, by Vel\u00e1zquez himself disobeying orders in a similar manner, have changed, and he is arrested for abusing the natives in Cuba. He is reinstated, but dies in 1524. What are you going to do? Arrest a major hero after these feats because of the claims of someone who is not so nice either? The King ends up keeping Cort\u00e9s\u2019s family close, more or less. His son with Malinche becomes the Kings\u2019 page in battle. But rebuffs Cort\u00e9s\u2019 ambition and only provides enough extra for the \u201cHidalgo\u201d not to rebel. But a few of the people he fought with.. were not nearly as happy or \u201cimpressed\u201d. We have so much detail from so many accounts not only because of the history records, but because of the court records. As in lawsuits. Enough of the expedition of Cort\u00e9s sued him over unpaid Gold and land they were promised but once it was time to share the spoils was never provided, that we have a lot of different, close accounts of a lot of these events. Many either went legally against Cort\u00e9s directly or petitioned the King. Out of the money and Gold Cort\u00e9s provided, often the King paid them pensions. But Cort\u00e9s himself never seemed to respond to anyone who took him to task. So Cort\u00e9s, on the surface, lived a hero\u2019s life and died a hero\u2019s death. But not without stepping on as many toes in Spain as he did in today\u2019s Mexico. Which is part and parcel of the character of the man, and perhaps why the King praised him publicly and did support him, but privately kept his distance, and he never rose beyond being an important conqueror of Mexico and some mid-level nobility (better than what he had, for sure, but certainly less than \u201cGrandees\u201d of Spain even if he brought more new territory and subjects into the kingdom than all of them put together). This is also why the Spanish court quickly moved to send governors and Viceroys, particularly to Mexico, and removed the inheritability of Encomiendas as soon as Cort\u00e9s\u2019 kids were old enough to govern. Impressed? Yes. But if you were the King and knew all this, could you really ever trust him, really? So like in everything, impressing feats are a shade of gray. Of all the conquering figures, there is no more controversial to this day than Cort\u00e9s, and as you can see that controversy started from the very beginning. ",

Plus you dont have permission from the crown\u201d Many favored it and many others did not but you have to look at it in the point of view of the era. The Ottomans gave a huge blow to Christendom when they conquered Constantinople, so here where the Spanish saying \u201cOh yeah, you conquered Constantinople, Egypt and Hungary? Well guess what?! We conquered THREE great unknown civilizations and one of them had the biggest city of the WORLD!\u201d  Here we have the world in the year 1600, Spain and the Ottomans where the biggest and most powerful powers in Europe at the time. When I was a kid I wondered if Tenochtitlan was truly the biggest city of the world or just a lying attempt by the Spanish to brag to the Muslims and Europe but historians do find it among the top 10 and quite possibly bigger than any European city of its time.
