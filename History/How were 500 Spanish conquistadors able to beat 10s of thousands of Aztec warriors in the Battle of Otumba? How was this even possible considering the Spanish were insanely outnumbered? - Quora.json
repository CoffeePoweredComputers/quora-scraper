            "answer_text": "Castilian conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo wrote that when Hernan Cortes entered Tenochtitlan on that fateful day June 30, 1520, he had 1,200 Spaniards plus about 6,000 Tlaxcalan warriors. However, Cortes knew the game was up when his cunning was no longer believed by the Aztecs (Mexicans). Moctezuma was either killed by Cortes or by an Aztec crowd. Never the less, during Cortes\u2019 escape in \u201cthe night of terrible sorrows\u201d (La Noche Triste), July 1, 1520, he lost around 600 Spaniards plus about 4,000 Tlaxcalan warriors. With most of their cannon and horses lost, only about 500 Spaniards, with another 2,000 Tlaxcalan warriors limped their way around Tenochtitlan trying to reach Tlaxcala to the east before the Aztec Army would descend on them. However, at Otumba the Spaniards won an astonishing victory. After La Noche Triste, the badly wounded Spaniards straggled for about 10 days on their way to Tlaxcala, when an Aztec Army of around 10\u201320,000 caught up to them near Otumba (a site NE of Mexico City). The Spaniards had lost most of their cannon and horses during their escape. All they had was their courage and steel. They had no chance to survive a battle against the Aztecs. Had it not been for Cortes\u2019 genius the Spaniards and their Tlaxcalan warriors would have been exterminated. How did the Spanish defeat a much larger Aztec Army? Before this battle Cortes had defeated a similar Tlaxcalan Army on his way to Tenochtitlan. But at that time he used cannons and cavalry to a great effect. For example, the Tlaxcalans lost so many men and were so impressed that they asked for a Spanish alliance. Unfortunately, Cortes now had few cannons and even fewer horses. So how did Cortes and his Castilians defeat the Aztecs? Cortes knew he had no chance to defeat the Aztecs. However, he had an ace on his hand. Cortes knew from his experience battling the Tlaxcalan generals that the Aztec generals also flew colorful flags that indicated their rank and position. The Aztec generals thought this was going to be an easy battle. The Spaniards had lost many men and were recuperating from their wounds and had little technology to even the odds. However, the Aztecs generals made a fatal mistake. They had already sacrificed around 600 Spaniards and several thousand Tlaxcalans to their evil gods. Now they wanted to repeat the same ritual with live victims. Cortes knew from experience with the Tlaxcalans that once you killed a general, the Indian warriors stopped attacking and started to flee. So Cortes ordered his captains, Cristobal de Olid, Gonzalo de Sandoval, Pedro de Alvarado, and Juan de Salamanca, to attack all generals they could find, especially the big Aztec general. The captains used their lances and their horses and killed many Aztec generals, especially the big general. Once this happened the Aztec Army began to retreat and flee. At this point Cortes ordered an attack which destroyed the fleeing Aztec warriors. No one knows how many Aztec warriors were killed but it is estimated in thousands. Thus even with severely wounded Castilians and Tlaxcalans and little cannon and horses to even the odds, the Spaniards managed to defeat a huge Aztec Army. This proved beyond doubt that germ, steel and guns were not the principal factors of defeating the Indian civilizations. It was mainly cunning, intelligence, and balls of steel. ",

            "answer_text": "It wasn\u2019t just steel swords, horses, and guns. By the time Cortes reached Tenochtitlan, he had picked up a rather large force of Totonac and Tlaxcaltec allies to add to his small force of Spaniards. This factor is often forgotten in narratives that seek to (a) portray the Spanish as utterly superior, (b) celebrated the wonders of a higher technology, (c) disparage all of the native peoples as inferior, (d) portray the conquest as irredeemably cruel and barbarous to the indigenes, or (e) posit a sinless solidarity among equally victimized indigenes. Presumably, it must have been a great relief to the Totonacs and Tlaxcaltecs that, once beaten by the Spanish, the Spanish did no more than make them bow to a cross and have some water poured on their heads by some oddball in a brown robe rather than give up a lot of people to be dragged off by the hair, slaughtered, and eaten (as would happen after a Mexica/Aztec victory). After the conquest, the Spanish made Tlaxcaltecs (such as survived smallpox) eligible for titles of nobility, gave them the right to ride horses and bear arms (clearly regarding them as far better than the Spanish themselves were regarded under Muslim rule), and ordered that well-born Tlaxcaltec must be addressed as Don or Dona. Later Nahuatl-speaking settlements in northern Mexico and Texas stem not from transplanted Aztecs, but grants to Tlaxcaltec military auxiliary forces of the Spanish (along with their fellow Nahuatl-speakers, the Mexica/Aztec, the Tlaxcaltec were themselves a warrior people). It is clear that at least immediately following the conquest, the Spanish appreciated how their indigenous allies had aided them. ",
