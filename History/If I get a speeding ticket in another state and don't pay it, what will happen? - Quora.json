            "answer_text": "It depends on that particular state\u2019s laws. Some states have reciprocal agreements to suspend the license of a person who gets a ticket in another state and doesn\u2019t pay it. This happened to my father a few years ago. He got a ticket in Mississippi and didn\u2019t pay it and when he went to renew his Tennessee DL a couple of years later when it expired, he found out from the Tennessee DOT that his license had been suspended because of it. He got indignant with them telling them they had no right to suspend his license because of something that happened in another state, and quickly found out he was wrong. It cost him several hundred dollars because he had to go to wherever it was in Mississippi that issued the ticket, pay the ticket plus court costs, then pay a fine in Tennessee to reinstate the license. Also, most jurisdictions will issue a bench warrant if you don\u2019t pay a ticket and don\u2019t show up to court, so if you get pulled over, you might go to jail, which will wind up costing you a bunch of money also. At a gun store where I used to work, we had a customer get arrested when we ran his background check because of this exact thing and the small city, which was 300 miles away said they would extradite so officers from the city where we were came and arrested him to take him to jail to hold him for the city in Arkansas to extradite.

            "answer_text": "The first thing that will happen when the court date on the citation arrives, and you don\u2019t appear, is that the Judge will issue a bench warrant for your arrest on a charge of \u201cfailure to appear\u201d. The State in which you got your speeding ticket will then notify the agency that issues driver\u2019s licenses in that State, which will then suspend your \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d (pretty much the same as suspending a driver\u2019s license). That State will notify your State of residence, where you have a driver\u2019s license, and your State will suspend your driver\u2019s license for failure to appear in the other State on the outstanding charges. At this point, you will have wished that you had paid the speeding ticket. Now you have the cost of the speeding ticket, the additional cost for dealing with the arrest warrant, the cost of having your \u201cprivileges to drive\u201d reinstated in the State where you got the speeding ticket, and the cost of reinstating your now suspended driver\u2019s license in your home State. Your State will not reinstate your driver\u2019s license until your \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d has been reinstated in the State where you got the speeding ticket. That State won\u2019t reinstate your \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d until you take care of both the speeding ticket and the failure to appear warrant. Additionally, you will now have a \u201cfailure to appear\u201d on your permanent criminal history. ",
