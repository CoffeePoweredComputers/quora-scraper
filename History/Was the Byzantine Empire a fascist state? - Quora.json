            "answer_text": "The Roman empire in general, was. Both the ancient and medieval. It was a xenophobic state, an absolute monarchy, with military in power, that recognized as \u201cheretic\u201d any different idea that came in contrast to the central dogma of the state. It was like that, but, back then it wasn\u2019t such an extreme. I mean, during these times that\u2019s more or less how the whole world was. People didn\u2019t care so much for freedom of speech as they cared for security and peace. People preferred to have soldiers on every corner, to protect them from raiders, thieves, robbers and local \u201cgangsters\u201d who extorted local business. Security was valued far more than individual freedom, thus people themselves wanted a \u201cfascist\u201d establishment. The world in ancient and medieval times was very violent, those who had most physical strength, whether their own or their force, they enforced the weaker under their rule, from a ruler to a local gang. People wanted a state that would keep strong men in place and allow even the \u201clittle\u201d ones to dare step out of their house without the danger of being beaten up for extortion, or robbed or the worst of all, raided by a raiding party who would burn houses, loot and kill on sight any unfortunate person who couldn\u2019t run fast enough. But if you compare the Roman empire to outsider kingdoms, it was more progressive and successful community. For our standards, it was a fascist state, for the standards back then, it wasn\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "Fascism is a uniquely 20th century movement, a response to the unprecedented collapse of the hitherto global order after World War I. It cannot be retroactively applied backwards. To describe Byzantium as fascist dilutes the meaning of the word. The Byzantine Empire was simply the continuation of the Roman Empire in the east during late antiquity and the middle ages. It was more decentralized than Fascism would imply. It was an Empire in the antique sense. The closest comparison is the Roman Empire, because that's essentially what it was. Byzantium was a \u201cdeeply religious society. There were some contemptible Emperors like Phokas and the Angeloi, but the vast majority were honest god fearing men who worked tirelessly for the Empire.\u201d ",
