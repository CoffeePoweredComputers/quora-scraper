            "answer_text": "The answer is that he didn\u2019t want for her to be found innocent. He wanted her dead. The accusations and trial were just a means of accomplishing his goal. The trial was a sloppy frame-up, which indicates that not even Cromwell was interested in making the charges plausible. Eric Ives has shown that even with the scant surviving portion of the records we have, it can be proven that 75% of the specific charges are false \u2014 either Anne or her accused \u201clover\u201d had an airtight alibi and was not at the location where the supposed crime was committed. On one of the dates, Anne was still recovering from childbirth. The entire situation had been engineered so that there was no way Anne could escape her fate. The king and Cromwell\u2019s commission met in secret, devising the plan and getting everything in place before they struck with brutal swiftness, arresting Anne and her chief partisans in one fell swoop. All of the \u201cevidence\u201d and testimony had been collected (but never written down, in order to avoid a paper trail) and it was presented as a whole, not eked out over time as in a genuine investigation. Everyone was caught off-guard, as the king intended, and terrified into submission. They knew no one would actually challenge the evidence during trial. The trial process of the day didn\u2019t allow much ability for defendants to challenge what the prosecution presented as facts. Defendants had no advocates/attorneys, and could not call witnesses. They were not allowed access to their own papers, and were only told of the specific charges when they entered the courtroom, forcing them to come up with a defense on the spot. Religious belief during the era also worked against the defendants. It was believed that the process of trial was sacrosanct. If an actual innocent person was involved, God would create a miracle to prevent an innocent person from being executed. (Anne Boleyn believed it \u2014 she told her jailer that it wouldn\u2019t rain until she was exonerated and released from the Tower, and if she died, a terrible calamity would befall England.) If no miracle was forthcoming\u2026 well, they must have been guilty after all, at least of something, some sin in their lives for which God was allowing them to face punishment. Henry knew that Anne wasn\u2019t guilty of adultery, but he wholeheartedly believed she was guilty of something that was worse in his eyes \u2014 betraying him by \u201ctricking\u201d him into marrying her. He\u2019d been promised a son if he made her his wife, and all she\u2019d given him was a worthless girl and two miscarriages. She deserved what was happening to her for not being the woman Henry had created in his mind during his seven-year obsession with her. As often happens with obsession, once he got the object of his desires, he found it unfulfilling, and started hating her for failing to live up to his fantasy. He\u2019d never admit he\u2019d been wrong to marry her and simply set her aside with an annulment. Oh no. Even a few weeks before her planned murder, he was still insisting that ambassadors bow to her (and through her, him and his decision) \u2014even devising ruses to force reluctant people into it. He would still force his daughter, Mary\u2014 who hoped her misery had ended when Anne died\u2014 to admit he\u2019d been right, increasing his brutality toward her until she broke under the strain \u2026 and the realization the abuse had been coming from her father all along. That\u2019s why they used the adultery charges \u2014 putting the fault on Anne. So Henry was still \u201cright\u201d to marry her, but she\u2019d fallen into whoredom. She couldn\u2019t simply have one lover, because then people might laugh at the king for having a wife who preferred the caresses of another man. No, she had to be an absolute monster of lust, a woman so crazed with lust that she\u2019d sleep with her own brother to try to sate it. And to show all of England he hadn\u2019t been emotionally wounded by his wife\u2019s betrayal, Henry partied hard, riding his barge up and down the river, illuminated with torches and musicians blaring, making sure everyone saw he was having a great time while his wife languished in prison, waiting to die. No one would ever laugh at him, because he would be laughing louder and harder. In all of it, Henry\u2019s ego shines through, a portrait of obsession, murder, and evil, painted in Anne Boleyn\u2019s blood. ",

            "answer_text": "Henry probably didn't love her in the way you're thinking. He loved the idea of a son much much more that he ever loved Anne. For most of Henry and Catherine's marriage, they had actually been very close. But Catherine got older and Henry thought that a female heir would be the end of the Tudors. Not without reason either, as the last time an English king had tried to give the throne to a daughter it had lead to civil war. It is likely that as he got more and more desperate, he really started believing God had cursed his marriage, which was his claim for the annulment he asked for first. He might have gotten it too, except the Pope had already given a dispensation to allow him to marry her in the first place (hence the Pope would have to admit an error), and Catherine's uncle essentially owned the Pope at the time. But Henry was still desperate for a son, so the rupture with the church and with his wife went forward. Into all this misery came Anne, young, smart, and pretty. She also had the charm of the uncaught, as apparently she rebuffed his overtures many times, but eventually.. Then of course, she was pregnant and he was devorced and all he needed for his male heir was to put a ring on it. Then the baby was a girl. All that build up and he was back where he started. Imagine the disappointment and frustration. This alone was a strain on the marriage, but then the miscarriages came, one after another. Add in a brain injury that left Henry more intemperate and desperate than ever, the in laws who were obnoxious, and the fact that their relationship hadn't really ever had the time to deepen, and the stage was set. So the basic answer is he didn't love her all that much. He loved her because he thought she could give him what he wanted. Saddest of all is that all of this was probably preventable by Henry not trying quite so hard. The current thinking is the multiple pregnancies back to back left both Anne and Catherine before her too ill to have healthy children. ",
