            "answer_text": "This term refers to European Royal nobility and is a metaphor that describes the profound blue appearance of the veins and skin.   The term Blue Blood (aka sangre azul) has origins that may predate recorded history. It is very certain a number of factors may have created this term.   Queen Elizabeth I, less than real life portrait where the artist was challenged by the very Blue skin and veins.  See the temples and the hands for more detail.  Royal RH Factor Just about all of the European Royal families have the RH Negative (Rhesus Monkey Factor Negative, RH-) blood with a high degree of \u201cO\u201d type blood.  Prince Charles, for example is RH-type O (http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963393,00.html).  Thus we can establish that there is a unique blood type for Royal nobility. The distribution of RH-blood is less than 5% in total world population.   Since Karl Landsteiner discovered blood grouping in 1901 there has since been over 30 groups added with over 600 blood group antigens. It seems that the antigen found in European Royal families has a distribution of less than .1%.  RH-blood can contain elevated Copper levels when compared to all other blood types.  This elevated Copper content may allow for a more pronounce Blue hue to the appearance of the blood while in the vein.  \u201cThe Royal Disease\u201d, the high incidence of Hemophilia in Royal families may also be attributed to selective in-breeding and the high concentrations of RH- blood. Most recorded history state the term Blue Blood originated in 1834 in Spain with Royal families that made a claim of Visigothic decent (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility#.22Blue.22_blood).  However this simply is not the case. Version of this term and observations along with art from periods as far back as 2500 BCE confirm similar terms were in use. There is a however a clear case that the Basque people of Spain and France have the highest concentration of RH- blood at this point.   Silver Spoons, Goblets And Plates Silver has one of the most powerful antibacterial properties of any substance naturally occurring.  Silver was a very pronounced way to portray wealth by Royal families and went about to use it for many common items.  Most pointed to this insight is the use of Silver forks, spoons, knives, drinking goblets, plates, etc.   The very high use of Silver eating and drinking conveyances means that there was a very high transfer of ionic and colloidal silver mixed into the alkaline and acidic foods.  Most directly the Silver Wine Goblet could leach 100s of parts per million of Silver in the Wine.  History shows that there was a great deal of Silver Wine Goblets in use with the Royal families.  High consumption of Silver actually allowed for very high resistance to bacterial infections. However, the very high levels of Silver also caused Argyria (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyria). The condition of Argyria literally caused Blue skin and rather pronounced blue veins and arteries.   No Tan Lines  Royal nobility through just about all of history would covet the notion that they were \u201cuntouched by the sun\u201d and thus were not tanned.  Tanning was a sign of a manual laborer that spent a great deal of time outdoors.  Thus the very pronounced white almost translucent skin became a part of the Royal image.  This type of skin allowed for a much more pronounced view of the veins and arteries.  Conclusion We can be very certain that the combination of a very unique RH factor along with the Blueing effect of high use of Silver with very translucent skin created the term Blue Blood.  There is no doubt that the common person or peasant would marvel at the skin and the pronounced Blue color of the Royal blood coursing through the Royal veins. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A:) The term blue blood ,according to some authorities in such things , came from American history. The average person had to work in the fields so they had a tan. The wealthy did not do farm labor but had others do it for them so the rich did not tan. But beneath their forearms, their skin was very pale. The blood in the veins showed through as blue. Hence blue bloods. This idea still had many adherents in the more agricultural days of the early 20th century. Many women went to the fields in big hats , long sleeves and long skirts or pants to avoid the sun to keep from getting the \"farmer's tan\". The illusion they wanted people to believe was that their husbands were wealthy enough to hire farm workers instead of their wives having to help in the fields. ",

While veins may appear blue in very fair skinned people, it seems a little far-fetched to call them blue blooded just for that although it is a very plausible theory. They could also have been referred to as the \"fair skinned aristocrats\" as that would have also described them accurately.  Dig deeper for answers and you will find that many things are not as symbolic as we think. Some things were literally described as they 'were'. ",

During the centuries when the dark-skinned Moors ruled Spain, members of the old Castilian families were wont to say with pride that their blood had not been contaminated by Moorish or other foreign admixtures. The term they used was 'sangre azul,' which probably sprang from the fact that the veins of the fair-skinned are visibly blue.\" \" From the \"Dictionary of Cliches\" by James Rogers (Ballantine Books) ",

By the 19th century, under the influence of Washington Irving and others, the phrase was in use in the U.S for well-born people. ",

If you look at the inside of your wrist, you might notice that your veins have a blue-ish or green-ish tinge. This is due to the undertones of your skin. Royal families often had very translucent, blue-toned skin due to inbreeding and reptilian descent; this made their blood appear a more bright, azure blue than anyone else. A yellower tone to the skin would show the veins as more green than blue. ",
