            "answer_text": "The real question must be \u201cHow Greece become not Albanian when there were no Greeks\u201d. Almost all the heroes of Greek Independence were Arvanites/Albanians by blood and language as all other Albanians. They uprise against high taxes and never fought for a Greek state. But after the war then politicians took over. The Arvanitas/Albanian Heroes were all dead in very suspicious circumstances. The Europeans were eager to make up something that didn't exist, Greece when the population had nothing to do with ancient Greeks. They wanted to create a narrative that \u201cwe are now building a democracy exactly as in ancient Athens\u201d . Here follow this link to listen to what Greek historians have to say about the population in Greece and Albanian fustanella.  In fact, Athens, when it was a democracy, had about 50,000 citizens. It was not applied in a million people country, and those who had the right to vote were free citizens, not slaves or foreigners who lived in Athens. Today the narrative has changed totally. They want to convince people that Democracy could exist in a multiracial country. The goal is to flood Europe with Asians and Africans and push for interracial marriages to create the Asian Negropean. The German King Otto started to introduce abstract and irrelevant new notions like-named streets and squares of Athens with the names of ancient Greek Philosophers, introduced Drahma as currency, and made Greek obligatory and the only language in public schools and in-state Institutions. So, Albanian was spoken only at home. In fact in the beginning, right after the revolution in Greek Parlament was spoken Albanian only formally documents were in Greek. Andruco the Chairman of the Greek Parliament was an Albanian who was killed later by throwing down from the Parthenon. There is a story that when a Greek parliamentarian kept asking to speak Andruco ignored him for a long time. Then he asks why don\u2019t you give me the right to speak? Andruco answers in Albanian \u201cSe keshtu dua une\u201d (Because I dont want to). Then Greeks started the policy to divide Albanians based on religion and create hostility between Albanian by saying that Orthodox Arvanites are Greeks and Muslim Albanians are Turks. So, they deported Muslim Albanians (Cham) in 1923 to Turkey based on the agreement they had with the Turkish Government to exchange population-based on ethnicity. This stopped when the international community and Albanian government understood what Greeks were doing. However, intimidation and persecution continued against Muslim Albanians. The other peak of persecution was in 1945 when Zerva who was Albanian orthodox from Suli (we call such criminals bad Albanian blood, traitors) massacred and forced the rest of 20,000 Cham Albanians out of Greece. Distinguished Arvanitas who through their studies and activities try to revive Albanian language and teach Arvanitas who they really are like Aristidh Kola, Jorgo Maruga, Anastas Kullurioti are poisoned with poison that causes leucemia by secret services of Greece. They are considered heroes by Albanians. The terror and assimilation have not stopped to this day in Greece. Here is an authentic recording where Albanian journalists are invited to Aristidh Kola house.  Jorgo Maruga created Arvanitas League \u201cMarko Bocari\u201d.  Here is a picture of the Newspapers of Anastas Kullurioti and a link to Anastas Kullurioti - Wikipedia  Albania during communism was very isolated and the communist government never did anything for Arvanitas, but after democracy, things have changed. This is the story of \u201cWhy Greece didn't get North Epirus\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "A really interesting question is why Albania became non-Greek when the modern codified Greek language emerged from the Arvanit language. It makes some sense to ask an anonymous individual because he is confused. The fact that the policies of European powers, France, Britain, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Prussia wanted to find allies among the Christian population to expel the Ottomans (Muhammadans) they made political experiments at the expense of the Balkan population, the Orthodox Arbanas and also new created ethnicity in 1905, the Vlachs (impossible to be an orthodox in modern day Albanian/Arber) from them has been made Serbs and from the Arvanites made Greeks (oh, they are ArVanites not ArBanit). After 200 years of creating a new history, of course many will wonder and ask the question WHY? Here is WHY: Eclectic Magazine It is also interesting that today's newly composed nations, filled with national history, are strong with a jaw and a keyboard for some glorious history. Let each of them look for how their grandfathers were surnames (or kind of because surnames has been invented in second half of 19 century) in the 18th century, probably they can find in church documents from that period? oh, who will understand Koine's language ....
