There are \u201cmaximalist\u201d and \u201cminimalist\u201d historians; I\u2019d go with the latter, who use archaeology rather than oral tradition. The Bible is not a very accurate set of documents for making historical assertions the futher back you go. Israel Finkelstein says that Judaism began in the hill country outside Jerusalem; lack of pork bone debris in digs suggest a change among some subset of the Canaanite population occured. see e.g. discussion in Pig Husbandry in Iron Age Israel and Judah Scripture hints at a slow change in theological ideas over time. \u201cYahweh\u201d was a southern god worshipped in a henotheistic way first, as a god in a group of gods living in a royal court, more akin to Zeus than the Yahweh we know now. Yahweh had a wife/consort; how or why or by whom a true monotheistic idea came about is unknown. Egyptian Aten-worship and Zoroastrian concepts may or may not have influenced it; there is no direct evidence. You could have had \u201cAbiru\u201d (Hebrews) before \u201cJudaism\u201d or a \u201cHouse of David\u201d tradition without a real David (think \u201chouse of Hercules\u201d). By 600 BC with the Babylonian Jews and their ideas and their return you had a core of monotheists, and without monotheism no Judaism. Since they railed against polytheistic rulers and common people still in their midst it appears even then that \u201cJews\u201d was a self-identifed ethnic group before a unified religious one. You can pick any date before 600 BC and it is little more than a guess. 1000 BC? Become Part of Biblical History has a discussion but keep in mind that \u201cIsraelite\u201d may not quite mean \u201cJudaism\u201dif people were still worshipping a polytheistic or henotheistic Yahweh rather than a monothesitic one. Jewish god Yahweh originated in Canaanite Vulcan, says new theory ",

            "answer_text": "\u2026. Age of Jewish dates \u2026\u2026 Abram was a Sumerian, but never existed made the first follower of Judaism in 456BC & set retroactively to 1800BC. He was Judaized only to show that a Sumerian, son of Priest Terah, would leave his God for a Canaanite God Yahweh. That was the deceit of the Clergy on their followers. Noah before him in 2700BC & his family of eight were conjured up also after 456BC to show that killing off mankind rekindled mankind with him making him the first showing that mankind is Jewish. This was the deceit of the Clergy on their followers. Mose was made Jewish from Yahweh to show that his Judaism & his people were greater than the Egyptian Empire. This was the deceit of the Clergy on their followers. Samson was made Jewish from Yahweh to show that he was greater than the migrant Carthaginians called Philistines by the Greeks to show that one of theirs could singlehandedly crush them, he died in 1175BC. The Philistines ran roughshod over contiguous Peleset, Palestine, after 332BC for 200 yrs. - This was the deceit of the Clergy on their followers. PS The first Jews were only the subjects of the Chieftain & later Kingdom of Judea in 933 till 586BC. The first Israelites were the subjects of the Chieftain & later Kingdom of Israel from 933 to 722BC. PPS There was nothing as Jewish or Judaism before 456BC in Jerusalem, as all leaders Chieftains & Kings from 1029BC to 586BC & on to 456BC worshiped the Canaanite version of polytheism. Judaism arrives, as a version officially, with Canaanite Priest Ezra! Ezra was the first Jew, the first one to bring it on having been started by the Prophet Elijah in the 9th C BC, but getting nowhere with the Yahwist Cult. ",
