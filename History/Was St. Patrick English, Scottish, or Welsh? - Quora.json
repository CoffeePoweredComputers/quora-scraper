            "answer_text": "Difficult answer to the question as he was born a Roman Britton, which covered Wales at that time. Some sources mentions Cumbria, which is in the North of England near the Scottish border. Though most agree that at age 16 he was torn by Irish raiders from his father\u2019s villa and carried into slavery in Ireland. He spent six bleak years there as a herdsman. Upon dreaming that the ship in which he was to escape was ready, he fled his master and found passage to Britain There he came near to starvation and suffered a second brief captivity before he was reunited with his family. Thereafter, he may have paid a short visit to the Continent. Although whilst in Gaul he was baptized a Christian, his missionary work began in Ireland. There have been stories that he met St David, but this would have been on his missionary work to Ireland. This meeting could be behind the story of St Patrick being Welsh. Before the end of the 7th century, Patrick had become a legendary figure, and the legends have continued to grow. One of these would have it that he drove the snakes of Ireland into the sea to their destruction. Patrick himself wrote that he praise over 30 people from the dead, Another legend, probably the most popular, is that of the shamrock, which has him explain the concept of the Holy Trinity, three persons in one God, to an unbeliever by showing him the three-leaved plant with one stalk. Traditionally, Irishmen have worn shamrocks, the national flower of Ireland, in their lapels on St Patrick\u2019s day, March 17. So quick summery. Born a Roman Britain, converted to Christianity in Gaul. did missionary work in Ireland, Drove the snakes to the sea, and created the national emblem. ",

            "answer_text": "His father was a Vicarus, a Roman official. So he was from an organized part of coastal Britain. The Irish slavers operated strongly in the West of England, Wales and Northern England. So he could have been from any of those areas. The biggest slavers camps were North Devon, Breconshire (the name Merthyr Tydfil represents the death before dishonour of a local princess captured by Irish slavers) and the Lleyn Peninsula. And of course, Scotland is named after successful Irish invaders. Given that Patrick arrived in Ulster a Northern orgin is most likely so probably Cumbria rather than Cambria but modern Wales can\u2019t be ruled out. For example, Caernarvon is near the sea and a Roman town/fort where administrative capability may have survived. So is Carlisle. ",
