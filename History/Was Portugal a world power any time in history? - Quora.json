            "answer_text": "Wow! You do have to pick up any world history book to find this answer: Portugal indeed was a world class power since the 1450s (soon after thay had expelled the last Moors from their territory) when they became interested in the spice trade, at the time, monopolized by the Republic of Venice which controlled the Western Mediterranean and the trade contacts in the Middle East (spices were brought from the Far East via the Spice Route to the seaports in the Middle East, where the Venetians bought them), so they began the search of sea routes to the Far East sailing around Africa. By the end of the 1400s, the Portuguese were able to strike deals with spice producers in India, and that gave way to the wealth of Portugal in the XVI century for spices were in high demand among the European royalty, nobility and rich bourgeosie and were more expensive than gold. Another source of wealth that the Portuguese found while sailing to India was the slave trade. For three centuries, the Portuguese controlled the trade of slaves captured in Africa to be sold in America to work in sugar, tobacco and cotton plantations, which led to the Triangular Trade. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, after they discovered an all water route to India via the Cape of Good Hope. They had colonies or trade reps in many parts of India and the far East, even Japan and South America. They lost power as the larger countries in Europe started to flex their muscles by developing their own empires and also due to internal political problems. Portugal did not have the strength to resist these larger countries. A good example of their power today is to remember that Brazil was a former Portuguese colony and Portuguese is the main language spoken there. ",
