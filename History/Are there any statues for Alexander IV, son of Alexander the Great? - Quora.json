            "answer_text": "There are a few circumstances under which the removal of all iconography of an individual occurs. The practice of damnatio memoriae (\u201ccondemnation of memory\u201d) dates as far back as the attempted cleansing of Hatshepsut from the historical record by Seti I in the 13th century BCE. To understand why there are so few artistic depiction of Alexander IV, we must look at the circumstances of his life and death. Alexander IV was born into a power vacuum. Alexander the Great, his father, had died on the 11th of June 323 BCE, while his mother, Roxana, was still pregnant. There was significant dissent among the troops of Alexander the Great about the heir to his vast dominion. The majority of his infantry troops supported Philip III (Arrhidaeus), Alexander Sr.\u2019s half-brother. Philip III was in Babylon at the time of Alexander III\u2019s death, but he was widely considered to be feeble of mind and mentally unfit to rule. Perdiccas, the commander of the elite Companion cavalry, who was part of Alexander the Great\u2019s inner circle, insisted that Philip III not be appointed successor until Roxana delivered her child so that they could see if the baby was male. Meleager, the commander of the infantry, threatened to go to war for Philip III, but Perdiccas ordered him to be killed. A compromise was then engineered, wherein Arrhidaeus would take on the throne (with the regnal name of Philip) and once Roxana\u2019s child was born, should he be male, he would become co-sovereign. However, Arrhidaeus would reign, not rule - that duty was given to the regent, Perdiccas. Alexander IV was born in August of 323. (For further information on the nature of the compromise, read about the Partition of Babylon). Perdiccas was the first of the Diadochi to fight over the scraps of Alexander\u2019s empire, and immediately set out to consolidate the empire\u2019s borders and seize power for himself. Almost immediately, however, there were immediate tremors in his regency. His appointee for satrap of Phrygia, Leonnatus (a somatophylax) sailed to Macedonia to take Cleopatra\u2019s (Alexander the Great\u2019s sister) hand in marriage. In 322 BCE, Perdiccas marched into Asia Minor to quell this show of disobedience and ordered Leonnatus to stand trial, but he died before the orders reached him. At the same time, Cynane, half-sister of Alexander the Great arranged for her daughter, Eurydice to be married to Arrhidaeus, bypassing the regent for permission. Fearful of Cynane\u2019s influence, Perdiccas ordered his brother to kill her, triggering the discontent of the army to the extent that he not only called off the killing but also permitted the marriage of Eurydice to Arrhidaeus. Perdiccas then attempted an invasion of Cappadocia, which was still under the control of the Persians. However, Antigonus I was unwilling to support him during the conquest, and fled to Antipater in Macedonia when ordered to stand trial for treason. Perdiccas then turned to consolidating his personal handle on power. He turned down marriage with Nicaea, Antipater\u2019s daughter, and instead married the aforementioned Cleopatra, Alexander the Great\u2019s blood sister. Due to Arrhidaeus\u2019 feebleness and Alexander IV\u2019s mother being Persian, he now had a claim to be Alexander the Great\u2019s successor, not merely a regent. Perdiccas then ordered the body of Alexander to be sent back to Aegae, in Macedonia, where the royal family was traditionally buried. However, on the body\u2019s journey, Ptolemy I was able to seize it in Syria and display the cadaver in Memphis, Egypt. Perdiccas then began an invasion of Egypt, regarding this as an unforgivable provocation. However, after being unable to cross the Nile and facing mounting casualties, his troops revolted and murdered him, marking the end of the First Diadoch War, At the Partition of Triparadisus, two new regents were appointed, but Eurydice was able to act to remove them. However, Antipater was too powerful, and soon he became the single regent. Antipater died in 319 BCE, and appointed Polyperchon as his successor, passing over his son, Cassander. Cassander allied himself with Ptolemy I and Antigonus, and with Eurydice, who saw this as an opportunity to put herself and Arrhidaeus in power. Polyperchon allied himself with Eumenes of Cardia, a satrap, and Olympias, Alexander the Great\u2019s mother. While Polyperchon saw initial success, his fleet was destroyed in 318, and he was forced to flee to Epirus with Roxana and the young Alexander IV after Cassander seized Macedonia. Aeacides of Epirus (Pyrrhus\u2019 father) allied himself with Polyperchon on his cousin, Olympia\u2019s, urging, and they invaded Macedonia in early 317. When Olympia took the field in battle, Cassander\u2019s troops refused to fight against the great Alexander\u2019s mother, and Polyperchus killed Eurydice and Arrhidaeus, leaving Alexander IV as the sole king and Olympias as regent. Cassander returned in 316 BCE with a stronger army, invaded Macedon and killed Olympias, and imprisoned Alexander and Roxana in the citadel of Amphipolis. When the Third Diadoch War came to an end, the peace treaty recognized Alexander as king, to succeed Cassander when he came of age. However, supporters of the royal house began to agitate for Alexander to be made king upon his age of majority, which in Macedon was 14. Cassander swiftly responded: he ordered Glaucias, a member of the Companions at Gaugamela to poison Roxana and Alexander IV in late 309 BCE. Alexander was buried alongside his grandfather, Philip II at Vergina near Thessaloniki, and Cassander became King of Macedon. Cassander was said to have a special disdain for the royal family, being said to not be able to \u201cpass a statue of Alexander without feeling faint.\u201d He first offered amnesty to Olympias and then executed her without warning. The reason for this derives from an incident in Alexander the Great\u2019s royal court. In 324 BCE, after Alexander had claimed the Persian title of King of Kings, he also adopted the Persian tradition of proskynesis, or full prostration in presence of a master. Cassander is said to have laughed at this practice in front of Alexander, who grabbed Cassander and smashed his head against a wall. Thus, after having killed Alexander the Great\u2019s son and wife, and taken the throne for himself, he ordered the removal of all iconography of Alexander IV, in fear that supporters of the royal family might rally against him.
