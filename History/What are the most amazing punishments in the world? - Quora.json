            "answer_text": "How do you define most effective? The cheapest? The one with the lowest re offense rate? The one that is the most humane while stopping the criminal from reoffending? The second cheapest is community supervision. The Court gives you instructions on how to put your life back together. If you follow them and stay out of trouble, then there is no incarceration cost. Corporal punishment is even cheaper because you just have to pay for the flogging that\u2019s it. The one with the lowest re offense rate is the Death Penalty. 100% success, no one reoffends after they have been executed. With the current appeals system it isn\u2019t the cheapest and in fact may be the most expensive option. Just for starters the state pays for both sides attorneys, expert witnesses, Lab work, and appeals that grind for years. The most humane that doesn't result in the offenders death is a prison sentence. While locked up they don\u2019t produce any new victims in society. It also gives the offender a chance to \u201cReflect\u201d and decide to maybe do something better. Then again most in fact get back out and reoffend. So in the long run it isn\u2019t the cheapest, or the most effective. ",

            "answer_text": "It would depend on what one is being punished for. Generally speaking I believe compensatory punishment is the most effective. To a person who defames having to wear a placard saying what a great person their target was would be hell. To a person who is greedy and steals having to financially compensate would be hell. Generally people who throw rocks hate rocks being thrown at them and people who cuss at other people hate being cussed at. Through their misbehaviour people generally reveal what they dislike ",
