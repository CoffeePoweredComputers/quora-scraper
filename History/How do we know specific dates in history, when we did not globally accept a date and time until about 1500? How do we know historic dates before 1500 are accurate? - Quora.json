            "answer_text": "Comets! Lunar Eclipses! Etc. One way is to use recorded (and even computed) celestial events to helps us anchor the many different calendars that existed in antiquity. These events are often recorded in antiquity, along with the day (on the calendar) on which they were observed. Because we can often trace these events by day count (google Julian Date), we are often able to anchor the calendar based on the event. As long as the calendar itself was reasonably stable, we can extrapolate forward and backwards based on the anchor points to a precision equal to the stability of the calendar. And actually, the Julian calendar was reasonably stable since it inception in 45 BC, so with a few exceptions, we can anchor those dates via the calendar itself. ",
