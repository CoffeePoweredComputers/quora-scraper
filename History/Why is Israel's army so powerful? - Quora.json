            "answer_text": "My 6 points are below. The most important one is \u201c\u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05dc\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05ea\u201d. The IDF has mandatory conscription of both men and women at the age of 18. This creates a huge and extremely diverse database. This way the IDF can choose the best soldiers for its top units - and for every slot there is a long line of people. Just to get the statistics - for special forces units the acceptance ratio (number of recruits who requested the unit and did all the tests vs. the one who were accepted) is between 1/20 to 1/50.The reservists are 66% of the total combat manpower. Israel is able to keep relatively small numbers of active units and build on reserve units in case of major conflict. This means that main part of the combat units - in case of war - is based on 30 y/o man, most of them married with kids.All IDF officers have started as a simple soldier and did the same training path as the guys they are in charge of. This actually makes IDF unique among other western armed forces. IDF officer is much better \u201cconnected\u201d to his platoon/company/battalion and earns his \u201ctrust\u201d through his actions and not by his ranks. They lead by personal example and in front of their troops.IDF is always busy - either by large scale conflicts or continuous anti-terror operations. This yields very rich operational experience and allows quick learning and adaption - in most combat units the majority of the officers have seen \u201creal action\u201d more than once.Troops safety in training is highly important. The number of casualties during training is very low and every single accident is thoroughly investigated.IDF combines unique relationships with US and have enormous investment from the governmental side. Israeli defense budget is 6.2% of the GDP - 4th place after Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Russia.So let\u2019s combine the all 6 points. You have soldiers, from ages 18 up to 45, protecting their families, friends and homes. Do you need a better motivation? Most of the key players are experienced officers with rich combat records. And most important - the sense of mission is deep and meaningful.

            "answer_text": "Nothing, it\u2019s military is not that strong, but compared to the armies around Israel who are JUST weaker. Why? for the same reason empires rise and fall; corruption. If your country is corrupted, then it is weak on all levels; education, healthcare, military, economy, outside policy, and above all, respect. Israel gathered all educated Jews from around the world, and using the UK and the USA, they trained them so hard until they have become really good on many industrial levels including the military industry. The could support that with unlimited financial support from many happy and ignorant taxpayers. However; Palestinian people have been resisting the occupation with rocks and primitive guns, and look how things are, it has been tens of years and Israel could not defeat their will power, so what is wrong? The only match for such huge military is willpower, and no gun in the world is big enough to erase millions of people who support the Palestinian just cause. But why other countries do not follow the same way Israel did? Corruption; the system is so corrupted that countries are relying on AID and loans, and using them to pay for the salaries of government employees and loyal military fractions, and the result is a very sick economy that is not able to support basic rights for the society. Who corrupted it? Who knows, leaders are responsible for that, but who assigned them as leaders? well, who else? So what is the solution? for countries around Israel, focus less on military and focus more on economy and development, and things will take care of themselves, it is the golden age of economy now.
