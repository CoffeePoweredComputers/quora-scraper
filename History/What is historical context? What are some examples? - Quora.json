            "answer_text": "Historical context is no different from textual context. It\u2019s often hard to properly understand a quote, when taken out of context. The same applies to historical events. So, when Mr Vatco provides a context of \u2018fighting for our god\u2019 as a background to \u2018the Crusades\u2019. he leaves out both context and events, which would be a good example of lack of historical context. While the Crusades certainly had a religious component, other components included mass hysteria, anti-Semitism, random violence (against Christians, Jews and Muslims alike) and sheer profit. The First Crusade, after the usual pillage and mass murder, established several Christian principalities in the Levant. But not just Chrisitan: they were Roman Catholic prinicpalities in an Orthodox, Muslim and Jewish environment. Then there were the callous transporters of the Children\u2019s Crusade (ending up as slaves in North Africa) and the Fourth Crusade, which finally wrecked the Byzantine empire. The same empire which had provided the pretext for the First Crusade. Historical background is what you need to understand anything from history. It is, on a very real level, the very stuff of history. ",

            "answer_text": "As others point out, historical context depends on the circumstances of particular time and location. Humans when we evolved realized that we would die. (I am fairly close at 75 years of age, but will probably be alive tomorrow. Don\u2019t hold your breath, or you will expire before me.) Evolution tells us do not die. Thinking which only our species does to our level says we WILL die. This is what is called a double bind.  I am not sure how many people in situations similar to this cartoon get smashed to death with a clipboard, but in my case in would provoke me to murder. To provide a more general example, it provoked people to invent religion. Religion will destroy us. A coyote is howling outside my window right now. Really. Dinner is ready. ",
