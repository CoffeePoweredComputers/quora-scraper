            "answer_text": "Spock was a hybrid between an H. sapiens mother and a Vulcan father. Star Trek was never big on identifying the species of sapients not from Earth. Thus, we get \u201cVulcans\u201d and \u201cKlingons\u201d but not a species name. Among hybrids on earth, we do not give a species name to a hybrid. Nor do we assign them to one species or the other. Instead, we make an \u201cx\u201d to denote a cross. Mule - Wikipedia \u201cSpecies: E. asinus\u2642 \u00d7 E. caballus\u201d If you wanted to follow the convention, Spock would be \u201c(Vulcan specie) x H. sapiens\u201d. The show, like many science fiction shows, played fast and loose with the science in order to advance the fiction of the story. Biologically, the idea that individuals from 2 sapient species that had separate evolutionary histories could mate and produce a viable offspring is absurd. Niven did this better in his Ringworld series, where the various hominid species could have sex, but not offspring. He even had a word \u2014 rishathra \u2014 for sex outside your species. However, Star Trek wanted to explore ideas of what is human, and specifically the role of emotions in being human. The writers could mix and match human and Vulcan physiological traits to match the story, i.e. when Spock was not killed by a creature that sucked out hemoglobin in human blood to get the iron because he had a copper based oxygen transport molecule.

Physically he was genetically engineered to be full Vulcan with pointed ears, green blood and heart where his liver should be.. He did have human elements in his type T negative blood. So he is a Vulcan by lifestyle and genetics. They live up to 250 years and are ten times stronger than humans. He was raised and trained to be a Vulcan. ",

This has led to a conflict with his mother trying to teach him to value emotion while his father taught him Vulcan discipline and logic. Spock's physical characteristics are interestingly far more Vulcan than human-green blood, limited telepathy and superhuman strength and resilience. ",
