            "answer_text": "During the French Revolution. It was re-criminalised in 1810, made legal again in 1939 if the woman\u2019s life was in danger, made illegal again by the Vichy r\u00e9gime in WWII, and then legalised in 1975. It should go without saying that making abortion illegal, or even a capital crime during the Vichy r\u00e9gime, did not reduce abortions. It just meant that women had to travel to other countries, or went to back-street and unsanitary abortionists, or tried coat hangers or other methods to try to end pregnancies. These often caused serious injuries or deaths. Now that birth control is easily available and abortion is legal in France, the rate of abortions is lower. ",
