            "answer_text": "Ms. Fraser is quite right that deterrence has worked so far and may continue indefinitely. Arguably we should understand that as nuclear weapons working extremely well. Mr. Simon is right that biological weapons, which could be created and used by very small groups, might not be deterrable. That would bypass nuclear deterrence although the destructive power of nukes would be unaffected. As far as the open literature knows, force fields that could defend against nuclear detonations are impossible even in principle, while missile defenses are very hard technically and impossible tactically, at least at the basically perfect standard of performance needed to defend a society against nuclear attack\u2014too many ways to counter or evade. As far as we can see from here, we are stuck with nukes forever. ",

            "answer_text": "Some kind of shield or force field in Star Trek terms. The shield would either have to block any incoming missile or completely defuse the nuclear component. However\u2026 A typical fission nuclear bomb is an uncontrolled reaction. Controlling it or stopping it is not something our science has found. Basically, if a nuclear war breaks out, hope to die fast rather than suffer from a rather awful death by radiation poisoning. ",
