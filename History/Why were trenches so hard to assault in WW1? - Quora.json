            "answer_text": "Not only did trenches provide the people inside complete protection from bullets whenever they weren\u2019t firing (and a lot of protection even when they were), they also protected them from the artillery strikes used to soften them up. Unless you hit right inside the trench then the shell wouldn\u2019t do too much. You can\u2019t fire directly into it since it\u2019s a hole in the ground. If you arc it you\u2019ll probably miss. If you get a near miss you might collapse a bit of the trench, but the blast and shrapnel probably won\u2019t do much and they\u2019ll just dig the trench out again. So artillery, the only real method of attacking before the men assaulted, was pretty ineffective. So now you\u2019re sent over the top. No fancy tanks. No vehicles. Little armor, and a bolt-action rifle. A smokescreen if you\u2019re lucky. Ahead of you lies the enemy trenches. They have a direct line of fire the whole time. They\u2019re only exposing their heads and arms. They also have machine guns, which fire much faster and more accurately than you can from your terrible position as you advance. And you can\u2019t just run straight across since they\u2019ve strung up barbed wire and your artillery didn\u2019t do its job. Depending on your commander, you can\u2019t run at all. But say you got incredibly lucky and actually made it to the enemy trench. You aren\u2019t done. You still need to clear the damn thing out, so if only a couple of you made it then good luck. When it comes to holding static defences, trenches are incredibly effective. The only thing better really is bunkers, but they take time and resources to build. Basic trenches can be quickly dug, and expanded over time until attacking them directly becomes suicide. This is still true today, but we have more tools to deal with them, like actually accurate artillery and air support. ",

            "answer_text": "Trenches have been used on battlefields at least since the Romans. It is easy to overstate the value and effect of trenches in WW1 \u2013 especially once both sides figured out how properly attack trenches. The outstanding issue of military history in WW1 was not the use of trenches. The outstanding issue of military history in WW1 is that defensive armament - especially artillery but also machine guns - had become so abundant and so deadly. Trenches offered defilade protection from direct fire weapons, and were commonly reinforced by screens of barbed wire in front. Trenches had serious disadvantages too. They would flood in heavy rain, and heavier than air poison gas would pool in trenches. Once a trench was captured by an attacker, although it might off some small measure of protection to its new occupants, captured trenches were often rather easy to retake by couner attack. Perhaps the best example of the problem of capturing an enemy trench occurred at Cold Harbor in MONTH of 1864 during the American Civil War. At Cold Harbor (Cold Harbor was situated deep in the Virginia woods; the name derives from the slang for a lodging house that did not have a kitchen) the Rebels used a forward trench as a trap. The Union troops assaulted the lightly defended Confederate trench and seized it, only to discover that there was a second trench built in such a way as to allow enfilading fire on the first trench. Seven thousand Union troops in the first trench and on the ground approaching the position were massacred in about twenty minutes by Confederate rifle and artillery fire. WW1 was a war in which defensive armament was vastly more effective than offensive weapons. The war was a monotonous series of battles over the same ground. As soon as one side would move within range of the other\u2019s artillery, they would get annihilated. WW1 was the first major war of the Industrial Age. Well organized factories produced ordnance and artillery shells on a massive scale. Millions of artillery shells were used in any major battle on the Western Front. Quick firing heavy artillery well supplied by road and railroad networks made it almost impossible to get very close to your enemy on either side. The picture below is a good illustration of what WW1 artillery did to the French woodlands.  Many of the French battlefields that we are used to seeing as barren, shell plowed moonscapes started out as fairly thick woodlands. WW1 artillery wiped those landscapes clean. Of course, soldiers timbered those areas for building materials and firewood also. Another factor to consider is that the great German offensive of 1914 overran a full third of France and was brought up short on the Marne very close to Paris. Unable to take Paris, the Germans retreated to the best high ground positions, dug in, and waited for the French and British to attack them. German trenches were much superior to British and French trenches. German trenches often included concrete and were spread in and irregular and unpredictable pattern, reinforced with multi-colored sandbags, and well camouflaged. French trenches were well made also: built in irregular and unpredictable patterns and well camouflaged. The French often (effectively) used piles of garbage to hide their trenches. British trenches (at first) were another matter. The first British trenches were built using white sandbags to create a straight and even parapet that made any movement by the British above the parapet easily visible to their enemy. German snipers used to kill mice crawling on the British trench parapets just to freak out the Tommies. Finally, the British copied the Germans and used different colored sandbags and zig zags to build their parapets. Much of the cause of horrendous casualties of trench warfare was that Allied tactics were badly outdated by the beginning of WW1. Allied war planners did not understand the long range deadliness of the magazine fed bolt-action rifle and the Maxim-style machine gun. At the Battle of Loos in the fall of 1915, British infantry in marching formation were sent directly against German defensive positions. In one place, the British infantry marching in close order rank and file went against just four German water-cooled machieguns and were mowed down - it was so bad that the horrified Germans machine gun crews voluntarily stopped firing after 2,000 Tommies were shot down in just a few minutes. The fighting on the Somme in 1916 was some of the bloodiest fighting in history - more than a million men were killed and wounded in four months. Allied tactics were especially bad. They tried to use torrents of light 75mm artillery to cut the German barbed wire in No Man\u2019s Land. The British and French infantry went \u201cover the top\u201d after drenching the German positions with millions of rounds of shell fire. The light 75mm shells did not disrupt the German wire and the Allied infantry assaults got caught in it and were massacred. WW1 trenches were definitely not assault proof. The word \u201cbarrage\u201d is French for \u201cbarrier\u201d. A WW1 \u201cartillery barrage\u201d was the use of artillery to isolate a section of enemy trench on both flanks and the rear so that it could not be supplied or reinforced. Each side would very often captured large sections of enemy trench line. However, a WW1 trench line was not a linear defensive position. They were backed up, often for miles, by supporting trenches where reinforcements were placed to be available to counterattack. Often the most forward trench was only very lightly manned. This had advantages. First of all, the massive enemy artillery attack would not kill very many soldiers and, also, an enemy attack om a forward trench gave clear notice as to where reinforcements should be sent. Seizing the enemy\u2019s most forward trench turned ou to be very dangerous, and could result in the attackers being trapped there (as a Cold harbor) without support and facing powerful counterattacks. By 1917, it was very possible to isolate a section of trench with an artillery barrage and cross No Man\u2019s Land and seize the enemy\u2019s most forward trench however this created serious difficulties. Mainly, the successful attackers were in a position separated from their friends by No Man\u2019s Land and without any way to communicate with their friends except by runners. It was very difficult to run a telephone line forward to a newly captured trench and even if you did, they were easy to cut. In this situation, the attackers lost all hope of artillery support once they entered the enemy\u2019s position. Trench systems were often very complex and unless you knew your way around in one, it was easy to get lost. Thus the attackers that took an enemy\u2019s forward trench had to quickly figure out he lay of he land and how to hold the new trench before the counterattack arrived. The defenders who were preparing a counter-attack however had three big advantages: they knew their way around their own trenches (they had good maps), they had intact telephone communications to the rear, and they could coordinate artillery effectively for the counter-attack. In 1918, the Germans, quite impressively, solved the problem of how to attack and hold a trench. First they would send wire clearing teams forward under cover of night, a smoke screen, and artillery barrage, or all three. Once the wire was cleared, they would send assault teams \u2013 called \u201cstormtroopers\u201d forward. The storming parties were equipped with a new weapon: the 9mm Bergmann submachinegun. The machine pistol was specifically intended to for trench clearing.  The assault teams were supposed to keep advancing deep into the supporting trenches while regular troops were brought forward into the newly captured trenches to support their advance. The use of the Bergman machine pistol against the British and French who had only bolt action rifles, revolvers, and hand grenades was very effective. The Americans, however, had something almost as good: the twelve gauge Winchester Model 97 pump shotgun. This is how a short barreled pump shotgun got the nickname \u201ctrench gun\u201d.  Model 97 (notice that it has a hammer) That must have been quite a sight to see Americans and Germans shooting it out at close range with shotguns and Bergman machine pistols. The great German Spring Offensive of March to July of 1918 successfully broke hrough the Alleid renches and penetrated up to forty miles into the Allied rear.  Once again, over a million men had been killed and wounded in just a few months. But the Germans had to stop. They were exhausted. Had they been able to launch that offensive a year earlier, they likely would have won WW1. However by 1918, there were too many fresh, well armed and well clothed American troops on the field, and the Germans had simply suffered too many casualties in the three preceding years.

The Allies launched the final war winning offensive in August of 1918, it included more than a million fresh American troops and five hundred tanks. Especially once the British figured out how to use tanks correctly - keep them together and only use them on solid ground (not the mud of Flanders) - trench warfare was over forever.  ",
