            "answer_text": "That you can lump all large-scale killings together under the single term \"genocide\" and treat them as if they were all the same. The term is badly overused for political reasons (like \"terrorism\") and it papers over important differences in these events, producing confusion and a distorted view of history. It is better to study them individually to find out what really happened.  As an example, what Pol Pot did in Cambodia was terrible, but it was a) not against people of another race; b) not a campaign to exterminate a race to the last individual. Calling it genocide and trying to equate it to Nazi policy is just gross misrepresentation. ",
