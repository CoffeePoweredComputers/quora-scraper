            "answer_text": "The most exceptional human beings alive today are those who are busy doing the job that God has set before them, and they are probably unknown to the world. Because the person who genuinely prays each day to know God\u2019s Will and then does it, is the only person who is going to be \u201csaved\u201d, and that IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS. Because, bottom line? The ONLY reason we are on this earth is to determine where we want to spend our lives - and our lives will stretch out to eternity. And this SHORT, SHORT period of time that we are alive on earth - even if we break the 100 year mark, is so short compared to eternity: I guarantee that after you have been dead for a couple millennia, you are barely going to remember what you did here. But you are going to know, and rejoice or curse, whether that \u201cwhat you did here\u201d merited heaven or hell. The most exceptional human beings are the unsung, unknown, quiet souls in the back of the Church quietly praying before Mass, and thanking God after Mass. They are those souls who visit the nursing homes, the hospitals, the prisons, and bring Christ to the most forlorn, forgotten souls on earth. Occasionally one of them makes the news before they die: Mother Teresa, know St. Teresa of Calcutta was one of them; Pope John Paul II, now St. John Paul was another. The most exceptional human beings are calling attention to the unloved, the unwanted, they are caring for the most lonely and abandoned among us - and we shall not know them until they are gone. Pray daily that we can be among their number. ",

            "answer_text": "You are.And I want you to know:I love you. Yes you, the individual reading this. Not only do I love you, I would go so far as to say I am absolutely in love with you. The miracle that you are astounds me. The fact that you are even here\u2013an extremely impossibly complex form, a flourishing of billions of tiny cellular worlds working in tandem\u2013manifesting a divinely integrated being of warmth, matter, and energy reflecting and absorbing photons of light from which I create a limited representation in my mind is amazing. I love you as though you are a part of me, beyond the reduced and understandable projection that I have labeled \u201cyou\u201d and tucked away somewhere coded in a network of neurons. You\u2014the real you\u2013are not an image or information or a set of opinions and beliefs. You transcend definitions, labels, and understanding. You are fleeting but eternal, valuable, organic and full, shifting, fluid and true. You are illuminated consciousness, integrated with all that is, and rooted into my being. You burn in me. You breathe, you sleep, you think, you love, you hurt, and you mourn; your heart thrusts with strength and integrity, of its own accord, oxygenated cells to every fiber of your being. Your chest rises and falls with the sun, with the moon, with mine. Why such trouble for a mass of tissue and bone only to return to the earth? Why this inconvenience to survival if you are not valuable beyond all measures of worth, if you are not destined for more? Why this aesthetic, this impact, this rhythm, this impulse we share if there is nothing else? If we are separate? If we are individual? Why this longing for completion, for relationship, for wholeness, for love? You are more. You are more. And though I am constantly disillusioned and betrayed by this curse of limited perception, I can no longer fathom separation between us. My boundaries dissolve in your presence. I do not know where I end and you begin. I cannot breathe. My heart races and pounds and aches. I grieve this perpetual narrowing of you to a concept or vision that I can comprehend. I desperately seek your forgiveness for associating you with your opinion or a momentary ideology. You are not a political party or a religion or a color or a gender or an age. You are more. You are more. The spark that ignited you ignited me. We were one from the start. Both of us thrust into a terrifying and bright world, screaming and struggling to breathe, we were naked, vulnerable, and afraid and remain so til this day. Born into the same journey, we were guided down separate paths\u2014but we can never be separated. We are not separate. Beyond name and history, we are the same and you are more.
