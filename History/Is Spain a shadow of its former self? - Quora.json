            "answer_text": "It depends. Spain\u2019s rise over the ashes of its civil war, and subsequent development without the aid of a Marshall Plan is an astounding feat that for some reason recieves no recognition or whatsoever. Our current standards of living are light years ahead of our grandparent\u2019s, both in material and social terms. There\u2019s no \u201cgood old times\u201d to be nostalgic about, despite our current economic crisis travails (unless by \u201cgood old times\u201d you mean \u201cthe 90s\u201d). Save for a more pristine state of our coastline, and a far healthier approach to politeness, I struggle to find out things that were better in our recent past. If you look at it with a wider historical perspective, Spain did had a huge, mighty empire in the past and that then it lost it. But the same thing happened to almost every single European country, yet nobody would say that \u201cAustria is a shadow of its former self\u201d or that \u201cEngland is a shadow of its former self\u201d. Spanish history is not that much different. Empires had their historical window of existence, but they are now a thing of the past. Spain did better than most in terms of size and duration, but then again, no country can withstand the trends of history. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Is Spain a shadow of its former self? Not at all. A simple middle-class person like me lives better than any King of Spain before Juan Carlos I, and with greater freedom. The history of my country has passed in the last millenniums from the tribal birth and the first civilizations (Iberians, Greeks, Phoenicians, Celts and Carthaginians) to mediocrity (during the Roman Empire), to darkness (from the fall of the Empire to the twentieth century), to a failed start of light (the Second Republic), to the nightmare (the Civil War), to the new darkness (Franco's dictatorship) and finally a more consistent and better quality light (current democracy). Spain has never been as powerful as it is today, the power to achieve a good quality of life for a higher percentage of its people, so large that a middle-class man lives better than a King of any past time.
