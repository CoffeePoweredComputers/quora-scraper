            "answer_text": "I just read the Madam Curie written by her daughter Eva Curie\u2026 It is really artistically written. It was as easy-going as reading a novel but in the other hand a real mirror of the famous scientist\u2019s life. Starting from her life in Warsaw and her early adulhood to her marriage with Pierre and all the problems they encountered, the autor gives us a full picture of every single detail. She brings some short conversations made by Marie wether with Pierre or anyone else which are so necessary to give us an insight of her life and personality. I would really suggest it. And if it will not make you cry, we will award you the Nobel price :p ",
