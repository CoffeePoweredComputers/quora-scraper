Frank doesn't even come close.Back in the early 60's there was a record store in the little town I lived in(EL MONTE,CA) They had a huge selection of Elvis 45's and I asked the proprietor, ''just how many Elvis records do you sell?'' He responded, ''at least 1 or 2 a week''. Doesn't sound like much right. Then he said, '' now just think, this is one little store in a very small town in America''. ''Think of all the little stores in this country, and start doing the math''. Frank doesn't even come close.Check this out: The BEATLES have sold over 1 billion.TOO BAD FRANK. ",
