            "answer_text": "Where Scottish claymores an effective weapon considering their weight?Why does everyone think claymores were so heavy? Yes they are big swords, and as swords go, they are pretty heavy, but not so heavy as to be unwieldy. After all, they are two-handed swords. Contrary to modern myth, claymores were deadly sharp, and not just \u201ccrushing weapons\u201d. Why make a club look like a sword? Due to weight distribution a sword is not an effective club. Sword blades are typically twice as thick at the hilt as they are at the point, to place the balance closer to the hilt. Most of that weight is in the hands, not lending momentum to the center of percussion, anyway. This is the Albion Chieftain, at over $1500, it\u2019s about as real as it gets in modern reproductions\u2026  It weighs just shy of 4 pounds, with a 36 inch blade, the overall length is 46\u20133/4 inches, nearly 4 feet! Whereas a heavy cavalry saber weighs almost 3 pounds, with a 35 inch blade. That is much more weight in the blade than a claymore\u2026 Can anybody argue that cavalry sabers were not effective weapons? ",

            "answer_text": "Swords aren\u2019t that heavy. A 16th century Scot could use both his hands to fight with a harquebus, pike, or claymore. The pike is 6\u201310 lbs, and harquebus 8\u201310 lbs. The Claymore is actually lighter, about 4\u20136 lbs. The only disadvantage they have is reach compared to the other weapons, which suggests they were used in charges against the open flanks of the pike squares And that\u2019s the two-handed claymore. The basket-hilted broadsword is 3\u20133.5 lbs. Katanas are only slightly lighter. These aren\u2019t buster swords or gunblades from anime-these are long, thin, sharp weapons with just enough blade to withstand a powerful slashing blow. So what\u2019s the problem with the claymores? Well, the two-handed sword doesn\u2019t have the reach of pikes or harquebus, and so can\u2019t go head to head against them. As more and more guns were seen on the battlefield, the claymore because not only vulnerable to that fire, but obsolete to a weapon that was guaranteed to reach the enemy formation. The other claymore had applications against lines of musketeers, but new socket bayonets and deeper formations countered them, as well as the increasing presence of artillery. By the Napoleonic wars, the claymore was the sword of British officers in the Scottish regiments such as the celebrated Black Watch and usually wasn\u2019t used as the fighting was done mostly with muskets and cannon.

            "answer_text": "Swords have always been not just weapons but to some degree they were (and still are) status symbols. In the case of the famous Highland Charge I think anyone welding a claymore would be the melee equivalent of a grenadier: the most physically impressive (high status tends to go hand in glove with good nutrition) and the metaphorical point of the spear.  Once an opponent or two is laid low, even if only hurt or simply forced back, a line is broken and more nimble, lightly-armed warriors could variously weild pole weapons or employ knives (in the case of some dirks, more like shortswords) and targets (small shields) most efficiently. It\u2019s pure speculation but I suspect infantry drilled by numbers would hate and fear facing large numbers of unpredictable opponents armed with a variety of traditional weapons in an all-out assault. In such circumstances I think it highly likely those on the more disciplined, organised, uniform side were sometimes very literally confused to death\u2026 ",

Anything that could be thought of was tried. If it proved effective, it would be used. If it was used enough, it found its way in to Our legends and history. From a sling that a shepherd boy used to the famous swords that were so skillfully wielded that they earned a name. If they were too heavy or not strong enough, they either would have been fixed to fill that requirement or discarded. The claymores must have been effective if we still talk about them today. ",

            "answer_text": "The claymore (big sword) was a crushing weapon rather than slashing or stabbing, It may be better compared to the likes of a mace. Highlanders would rush their enemies with claymores raised then bring it down on their heads in the first attack. The psychological effect of this rush was often decisive in intimidating enemies. However, in melee fighting the claymore was too unwieldy and heavy. For this reason highlanders also carried a \u2018dirk\u2019 which was similar in design to a short Roman sword and used in a similar way, upthrusting with a shield (targe) as defence. Highlanders also used a claybeag (small sword) which was more akin to traditional contemporary European weapons. ",
