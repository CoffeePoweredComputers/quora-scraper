            "answer_text": "If you want to work in archaeology, there are a few different tracks involved. To perform fieldwork (excavating, recording sites, surveying) you\u2019ll need to be, at a bare minimum, over 18 and have attended a field school. Most contract/commercial archaeology employers- which are the most common employers, by far- will prefer you to have at least an associates degree and a field school. Work at this level is performing archaeology, although very rarely will you be referred to as an \u201carchaeologist\u201d- mostly you\u2019ll be called an \u201carchaeological technician\u201d. Achieving this level generally requires a minimum of 2 years past high school for an associates\u2019 degree To hold a job where your actual job title is \u201carchaeologist\u201d, you\u2019ll require a master\u2019s degree- likely this job will be as a mid-level employee with a private firm or government agency. At this point, you\u2019re looking at 4 years of undergraduate education, plus 2 years of graduate school, for 6 hours total post high school. If you want to be a project manager or principal investigator, a high-level archaeologist (GS-11 and higher) in the government, or a college professor, you\u2019ll need a PhD. Depending on the program and the person involved, this can mean 4 years of undergrad+7 years of graduate work. This would be for a program where you earn a Master\u2019s on your way to your PhD. Some PhD programs don\u2019t work that way though, and require even master\u2019s holders to take the full curriculum. For someone who took this path, that could mean 4 years of undergrad+ 3 for a masters+7 for PhD, for a total of 14 years of post-secondary education before you\u2019re starting your career ",
