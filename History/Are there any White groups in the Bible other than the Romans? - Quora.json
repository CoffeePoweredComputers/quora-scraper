            "answer_text": "Every fiber of my being is screaming at me not even to address this question. But because I apparently lack any sense, I\u2019m forging ahead anyway. By \u201cwhite\u201d I assume you are referring to people of European ancestry, not merely the color of one\u2019s skin. That being the case, in the New Testament at least, there are several groups of European origin that are mentioned in the Bible. To start, Paul addresses many of his letters to churches that he established in modern day Greece. These include the communities he founded in Corinth, Thessalonica, and Philippi. As you may imagine, the population here was probably mostly ethnically Greek. Other churches established by Paul were founded on the west coast of modern day Turkey, most notably his church in Ephesus. While we might think of these residents as something other than \u201cwhite\u201d in modern times, owing to the invasion of this area by the Ottoman Empire, during the first century this region had been settled by Greeks. Although, the question of ethnic identity becomes complicated here (as it is pretty much everywhere) because this region had traded hands between the Greeks and the Persian Empire centuries before. So there was probably a lot of genetic integration from these exchanges. In the central region of modern day turkey, Paul established the churches of Galatia, which had been settled by ethnic Celts and then conquered by Rome. So if you consider the Celtic tribes to be \u201cwhite,\u201d then you may want to include this group as well. Outside of Paul, the book of Revelation includes seven letters to seven churches in its opening chapters. These are churches in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. All of these sit on the western region of modern day Turkey, and so perhaps the same ethnic description that I provided for Ephesus above applies to all of these areas as well. The first letter attributed to the apostle Peter (1 Peter) is addressed to the following regions: Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. With the exception of Asia, which is a complicated reference, the other four regions all refer to areas of northern modern day Turkey. So the ethnic description of the Galatian inhabitants as Celts referenced above would probably apply here as well. As a huge caveat to everything mentioned above, bear in mind that all of these regions were under the reign of the Roman Empire during this time. As with most regions of the Empire, there was a lot of trade between regions, and much travel among some certain groups of people (e.g., slaves and their descendants who were forcibly displaced from their homelands). Much of the empire was fairly metropolitan and consisted of a variety of ethnic groups. So there is a very real sense in which talking about ethnic identity at all is a problematic exercise at best, and perhaps even futile. There is also the question of utility here. What do we gain from identifying various groups mentioned in the Bible as \u201cwhite\u201d or \u201cnon-white\u201d? I would suggest to you that these two categories are a relatively modern phenomenon, and is emblematic of concerns that we have today in issues pertaining to race and ethnicity. This is very likely not a question that would have been asked in the ancient Mediterranean environment in which the New Testament was written. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes everyone in the Bible believed themselves to be white, just about. In Numbers 12: 1, Moses is recorded as having given offence because of his marriage to someone from Southern Sudan or the Horn of Africa: \u201cMiriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman.\u201d So there is apparently one Black person in the Bible, Mrs Moses, but it follows that Moses himself was not of this hue. Jeremiah 13:23 says: \u201cCan the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots?\u201d Black skins are thus a characteristic of Ethiopians, not Jews. Syrians are not by any measure Black, and are known to be the fairest of Arabic speaking people, apart from Circassians. All Mediterranean people, Spaniards, Italians, Greeks and Syrians were much of a muchness, and still are. The Romans remarked that the Celts were fair, and the Germanii even fairer. They said nothing about the Jews being of a different hue. The problem arises when you attempt to impose American categories onto the Ancient Middle East. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s probably worth noting that with the Romans originating from the Italian peninsula, they were probably just as dark-skinned as many of the Aramaic people. Heck, I had family migrate from Italy about 100 years ago, and when they first came to the U.S., they weren't even considered \u201cwhite\u201d. That being said, what is so \u201cevil\u201d about the Romans? They were an empire that conquered. That was a pretty standard practice back then, and not really anything that was inherently \u201cevil\u201d. Yes, the Romans had conquered Judea, but as was their standard practice, they would usually let the subjugated peoples rule themselves and handle their own internal affairs. I do believe the Roman governor Pontius Pilate himself did not want to crucify Jesus, but caved into the demands of the local Jewish rulers because he was on the receiving end of a lot of flak from the emperor due to some previous rebellions that had gotten out of hand.

Their time period was a very violent, harsh, brutal time period. All people groups at that time owned slaves and decimated enemies. Its just the way that time period was. By the standards of their time the Romans were actually very liberal and enlightened and sophisticated and accepting. As long as people obeyed laws and didnt commit violence the Romans didnt care what they did. And, no, in that time there were no large people groups who werent violent and brutal toward their enemies. Even the Jews were quite brutal toward non-Jews in many cases. ",

Are there nordic \u201cAryan\u201d blue eye blondes? Not that I can imagine. But since there are now, there must have been then too. Noah went into the Ark with his wife and three sons. Presumably the sons are from the same mother. So they must have resembled each other. The variation in human \u201craces\u201d must have been in their wives. Therefore the sons of Japheth who are said to include among their descendants Greeks and Romans must have had caucasian-like features. ",
