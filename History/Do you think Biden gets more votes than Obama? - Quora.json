            "answer_text": "I would guess that he will get more votes than Obama got in 2012 (~66 million, which is also about what Clinton got in 2016) but possibly not more than Obama got in 2008 (~69.5 million). If GOTV efforts by the candidates are effective, I could see Biden getting close. But not if suppression efforts keep people away. ",
