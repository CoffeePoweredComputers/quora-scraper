            "answer_text": "Humans are curious. Many have a semi-inate desire to set out and explore. At the same time, there are just enough folks who want nothing more than to set down roots and stay in one place. That being said, humans started out as hunter-gathers, requiring them to move around following their food as it migrated or was ready to harvest. Once they began cultivating the forests, they didn\u2019t need to travel as extensively. But no location on Earth has every resource (mineral or organic) needed for society to function to its fullest. There will always be people eager to explore, searching for new resources or new knowledge. ",
