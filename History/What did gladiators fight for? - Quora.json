            "answer_text": "Fame, wealth, glory, and their lives. Professional gladiators fought for fame and glory, and wealth. They were highly trained autocrats who chose the fame of the arena to other jobs, and it came with everything a modern-day celebrity would get. Their fame was in songs, poems, paintings and other works of art. Non-professional gladiators, the noxii, were condemned criminals who were sent to the arena to die in a sport. They fought for their lives, although this was a zero-sum game because they had already been sentenced to death. Theoretically, if they survived for long enough (through enough fights, which was rare because they were pitted against each other or professional gladiators), they could become professional fighters.

            "answer_text": "They fought for a lot of reasons - almost as many reasons as there were gladiators. Some fought against their will because they were forced to. Some fought because they loved the celebrity and adulation of being a winning gladiator. Some fought because they were psychopaths who loved fighting and killing. Some fought because they were trying to accomplish some goal. Some fought because it was better than working in the sulfur mines. Most probably fought for a combination of reasons. It's important to remember that life in general, and particularly for slaves, was short and brutal in those times. It's also important to realize that archeological evidence indicates that most gladiators did not die when they lost a match, as long as they fought well. So, for a desperate young man, particularly a slave, the opportunity to be famous was probably a pretty good motivator considering the alternatives of endless grueling manual labor until an early death of injury or disease.
