            "answer_text": "Let me tell you a story of two wars. The First Boer War In the First Boer War, the Boers of the South African Republic rebelled against the British Empire. They were of course the underdogs, with the British having far greater numbers and resources. However, they had a few things going for them, such as: Their men were skilled riders and marksmen.They knew the terrain.They had the support of the local population.They were fighting in a remote area, far from British supply lines.The British were occupied elsewhere.When the British did show up to fight, they conducted themselves like gentlemen. They occupied the towns, but this was not much of a problem. Wives and children of rebels continued with their daily lives while their husbands and fathers were doing hit-and-run attacks and killing British soldiers. The Boers won this war, and they reached a peace on terms that the British did not like so much. The Second Boer War When Round 2 broke out 18 years later, it initially seemed that the British had not learned anything from their first tussle with the Boers. Again, they engaged an entire army of skilled marksmen and swift riders, and again, they took heavy losses. But then the British did something very important: they decided not to be gentlemen anymore. This time, when they seized the towns, they did not just make nice with Boer women and children. Instead, they invented the modern concept of the concentration camp. They then rounded up everyone related to the rebels and interned them. Thousands of women and children died from starvation, exposure, and disease, and the rebels\u2019 supply sources disappeared. This broke the rebellion. This time, the Boers were defeated.  Why do I bring this up? How is it relevant? It is relevant in that it shows that a well-supplied global power can, in fact, defeat a determined local force. In fact, it can win in almost every instance. The thing is that it has to be brutal and ruthless. Our engagement with the Taliban in Afghanistan has been anything but brutal and ruthless. We have gone to great lengths to both avoid civilian casualties and to make recompense when we have civilian casualties. In a war in which the combatants are pointing guns at you one day and hoeing fields the next, that can get very convoluted and very messy. Add to this the fact that your enemies are indoctrinated to believe that they will go to heaven and get seventy virgins if they die in battle, and it makes outright victory basically impossible. I am not saying that we should be brutal and ruthless like the British were in the Second Boer War. I am saying that, so long as we are not willing to be brutal and ruthless, we shouldn\u2019t even show up, because it will only be a fiasco. My philosophy regarding national defense and nation-building is simple: If the government of a country does something to harm us, go on a punitive expedition: decimate their armed forces, destroy their infrastructure, and kill their leaders. Then leave. Don\u2019t try to micromanage them after that. Don\u2019t try to root out every last vestige of anti-Americanism. If another evil regime takes power, let them sow their fields with misery. We will stay in our own fields. And if they harm us, we will repeat the process. The petty despots of the world will learn pretty quickly what they will and will not get away with. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to this question is long but is quite enriching. When we try to resolve a problem and don\u2019t get proper results in resolving it then there could be multiple reasons: Either we did not analyse the problem properly.Or we did not have proper blueprint/planning to resolve it.Or we failed to implement the machinery.Or we did not have the capability to resolve it.In this problem all of them were simultaneously present: From 1996 to 2001, the Taliban held power over roughly three quarters of Afghanistan, and enforced there a strict interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law. The Taliban emerged in 1994 as one of the prominent factions in the Afghan Civil War, and largely consisted of students recently trained in madrassahs in Pakistan. It held control of most of the country until being overthrown by the American-led invasion of Afghanistan in December 2001 following the September 11 attacks. At its peak, formal diplomatic recognition of the Taliban's government was acknowledged by only three nations: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.Did you see that nation\u2019s name in bold , Yes the nation in support of Taliban was later asked by US to curb it. The Taliban were largely founded by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) during 1994. The I.S.I. used the Taliban to establish a regime in Afghanistan which would be favorable to Pakistan, as they were trying to gain strategic depth. Since the creation of the Taliban, the ISI and the Pakistani military have given financial, logistical and military support. Are you kidding me!! Both Pakistan and the United States employed failed strategies. For the American part, it launched a war it could never win because it was dependent upon the one country that opposed its key interests \u2014 Pakistan. The United States continued fighting the Afghan Taliban in Afghanistan, when its key vulnerabilities are in Pakistan. At the same time, it built an unwieldy and unsustainable state in Afghanistan whose leadership continued to be corrupt and unresponsive to Afghan needs. Worse, it incentivised Pakistan to continue aiding and abetting America\u2019s enemies through the Coalition Support Funds. If Pakistan had actually delivered, the cash flows would stop.Victory was elusive because Pakistan continued to support the Taliban, and its territory provided them with effective sanctuaries. When pressed, they could always slip across the border and live to fight another day. But Washington was never willing to go the mattresses and force Pakistan to halt its support, and it is not even clear that we could have done that without going to war with Pakistan itself. Washington backed off for very good reasons: US wanted tacit Pakistani cooperation in its not-so-secret drone and special forces campaign against al Qaeda, and They were also worried about regime stability given Pakistan\u2019s nuclear arsenal. Unfortunately, these factors made victory even harder to achieve. Now other reason , Prolonged, large-scale battles are rare. Instead, the war is a slow grind of guerrilla attacks, sporadic gun clashes and the occasional push to overrun a population centre. Homemade bombs \u2013 the Taliban\u2019s weapon of choice \u2013 continue to spread.Afghanistan is America\u2019s longest war, but it is a war America cannot win. And nowhere is this more evident than in Helmand.   \u201cEven if you kill all the teenagers, the next generation will join the Taliban,\u201d said Abdul Jabbar Qahraman, a former presidential envoy to Helmand. \u201cThe insurgency used to be mostly a business. Now it\u2019s also about revenge.\u201d Other reason, US Troops came up to fight a war and what they missed is making the internal Afghan police and army self reliant.Had they spent time on training the people and then supporting them , the success would have been multi folds. Achieving a meaningful victory in Afghanistan \u2014 defined as defeating the Taliban and creating an effective, Western-style government in Kabul \u2014 would have required sending far more troops (i.e., even more than the Army requested during the \"surge\"). Troop levels in Afghanistan never approached the ratio of troops/population observed in more successful instances of nation-building, and that deficiency was compounded by Afghanistan\u2019s ethnic divisions, mountainous terrain, geographic isolation, poor infrastructure, and porous borders.

            "answer_text": "Any country is defined by its culture and customs. Take the case of Afghanistan and its complicated by region or even town. Western culture is something the US embraces and teaches. It's something Afghanistan has struggled to reach within cities let alone the countryside. The Taliban are little different than terrorists and thieves. They enter a region to force their own version of culture while forcing the locals to also pay for their protection much like a criminal syndicate. They prevent the government from influencing any control by making it costly to deliver anything positive to hard to reach regions. Let's not forget that the government also doesn't respect most rural populations either so the tendency is to ignore the countryside or provide the simple protection they ask for. America fails because we don't focus on the real barriers to uniting the people and work with a government that also isn't interested in uniting the country. Mostly the Afghani government just wants to protect their own lives and let the rest of the country run themselves. We as Americans have ideals and truly believe by protecting the people that they will feel safe and grow as people under this protections. Until the Afghani people feel the same about all their tribes it's going to be impossible for peace to exist. This really isn't so much about the Taliban as it is changing the perception of old culture and beliefs that prevent change. It's a long game we have to pay for if we ever want Afghanistan to be peaceful and successful. ",

            "answer_text": "1. The Taliban were easily defeated, and they are consistently defeated on the battlefield. The Afghan government is in place and it is improving every day. 2. The first big problem with eradicating the Taliban is that they are not 'in Afghanistan.' They are based in Pakistan and funded by the Pakistani government. Unless you want to nuke the entire FATAH, the Taliban will still exist.3. The other big problem is that building the Afghan government is a process. You can't just show up in a war-torn, mostly illiterate, and ethnically divided country and just hope to prop up a stable democracy in a day. Or even a decade. That takes time. When the Afghan government fails to provide services, the Taliban gains strength. When the Afghan government demonstrates competence, the Taliban lose power. This is going to take a while.4. Thinking of war as a finite thing is outdated an obsolete. Everyone in America looks at WW2 for an example of what war 'should' be like. That is to say, we fight a war, we defeat the enemy, they surrender, and the war is concluded. This is no longer how it is done. In modern warfare, prolonged insurgency and counterinsurgency will be the norm. That means that even when the enemy is defeated on the battlefield, they will continue to use terrorism and subversion to exercise influence. The only way to 'win' permanently is to establish the supremacy of the Afghan government and eliminate the social and economic factors that drive discontent. ",

            "answer_text": "Taliban was the legal government of Afghanistan and probably at least 50% of the inhabitants supports the Taliban. taliban means \u2018taleb =student of koran\u2019 are pasjtoe, native people of south Afghanistan that fight for their religious believes ,independence of westerns oppressors tha they call \u2018unbelievers\u2019 ,against foreign invaders and aggressors. they came from madrassas (islam schools) in pakistan, some lived in Pakistan others were refugees from Afghanistan. Europa still hide the history of Afghanistan from the public.Taliban don\u2019t recognize the Durant-line,a artificial border, the amputation of the motherland Afghanistan around 1878 by the criminal big colonialists,Great-Britain and the Anschluss of a piece of the motherland to the Anschlus colonial India and after the partition to Pakistan. Afghanistan is/was strategic important for Great-Britain colonial criminal predators,situated between USSR (now russia) and colonial India.Afghanistan was for the first time attacked and invaded by the cruel british empire in 1838.Second time in 1878 and a third time in 1913.Taliban recognize the Durant-line,a artificial border, the amputation of.they came from madrassas (islam schools) in pakistan, some lived in Pakistan others were refugees from Afghanistan. Talibans don\u2019t accept the Durand Line and therefore there are not afghan and pakistan Talibans, just talibans that live in their motherland before the crime of amputate the motherland by cruel colonial criminals. From 1992 till end of 2001 Taliban was supported by the United States. U.S. at least since 1977 support,finance,arm and misuse what they call terrorists,moedjahedin fighters,I.S., Al-queda for politics and economic profit,control and exploitation. U.S. used the moslim fighters in Afghanistan,Chechenia,Iran,Irak,Lybia,Kosovo,Bosnia, previous central asia Sovjet Union republics,Syria\u2026 During the time of the socialist regime around 1977 of Mohamed Taraki who received the support of the Soviet Union, there was respect for the human rights of the poor ,there was a land reform,the small farmers receive a piece of land ,the workers had a dignified mimimum wage.The women did have many rights,they were free to go to school and to work in al sectors.The fact that the cruel world ruler, the USA, did everything to overthrow this socialist government, proves that the USA has no respect for human rights and certainly not for the rights of women. The USA, with the help of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, have financially supported and armed Muslim fighters mudjahedins to overthrow the democratic government for criminal geopolitical interests. The USA, as a cruel world ruler, could not accept that the Soviet Union would have an influence in Afghanistan. As a result, they have supported (who they then call freedom fighters ,now terrorists) financially and armed with modern weapons such as Stinger shoulder rockets to bring down aircraft and helicopters of the USSR, with millions of Afghan deaths and 17,000 USSR military deaths as a result\u2026 USSR retreat from Afganistan begin 1989, the socialist government of Afghanistan with respect of human rights and women rights still resist during 3 years the attacks of the moslim fighters (mudjahedin).During years they bombed Kabul from the hills.Around 1992 they took the power in afghanistan but then they began to fight with each other. There was a lot of chaos and crimes. The U.S.A helped to destroy democracy and the freedom of women in Afghanistan. Therefore U.S.A. ,Pakistan and probably some arab countries support a new group of fighters to bring stability and order in Afghanistan ,Taliban ,(taleb=students of koran),the scholars of the Madrassas (islam schools) in Pakistan .They get support financial,military from U.S. , Pakistan and some Arab countries.Taliban are mainly Pashtun a population of south afghanistan. In 1995 the taliban took control over Kabul and almost all Afghanistan except Pansjir valley. Taliban probably receive some help fighters from the moslim Nation with the same believes. Taliban brought stability and order to afghanistan even USA were satisfied.They met several times and even they came one of two times to the USA,negotiate with oil company UNOCAL.The lawyer and defensor of the interests of the Taliban, Laili Helms is cousine of Richard Helms a ancient american ambassador to Iran and chief of the CIA. The predatory aims of the cruel USA empire is to build a pipeline from the oil fields of central Asia to the persian gulf ,avoiding Iran and Russia territory.The problem is that the Taliban don\u2019t arrive to capture north afghanistan under control of United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan (now Northern alliance to brainwash the western people) of Ahmad Shah massoud. USA pressure the Taliban to make a unified government with Ahmad Massoud and threath the taliban with a shock and awe aggression war before the snow falls,before 9/11.USA had already menace to wage a illegal aggression war against Afghanistan before the 9/11 attacks.

America wants Taliban to be an allegation for the American troops in Afghanistan, Pakistan wants Taliban to destroy the Afghan Government so that not should bean stable country .Saudi Arabia wants Taliban to fight against Shia Religious Residents of Afghanistan, but they all have more great aims in the region.America wants to be in Afghanistan to have Iran ,Russian ,China and India's economics controlled ,Pakistan never wants Taliban to be removed from Afghanistan, so that Afghanistan never found Pakistan as a Loyal neighbor and counterpart because Pakistan wants an Afghan Government that should place Pakistan Interests in its foreign strategy but Afghanistan never accepts it. Saudi Arabia alleges itself as the Islam Leader in the world but no Muslim country accepts let alone Iran so many Pro-Iranians are in Afghanistan as Shias and second is that Saudi Arabia has, will face a great oil economic challenge to Iran meaning the want to have the Oil sender to Europe and America so they strive for it . The World Mafia needs Taliban to let the poppy smugglers grow it and produced and then should be sent outside of Afghanistan to the World Mafias so that some goes to World Terrorism Centers that are American and Pakistan . All these can be realized only by supporting Taliban and some other rebels in Afghanistan so still you expect the Taliban be removed so easily from Afghanistan. ",

Taliban is not just an organization, it's a way of thinking in Afghanistan. No matter what people in west want to believe or whatever CNN or BBC telecast, the ground reality is totally different. That's why US is losing ground and influence, and now they want dialogue with Taliban. One thing to understand is that you cannot change mind set of people in Afghanistan by making movies on them. Every power player in region wants Afghanistan to be like what they want instead of what it really is. So, the only way to get \u201crid\u201d of Taliban is to let the people of Afghanistan settle their issues through mutual discussions instead of imposing a US drafted solution just because US has spent trillions in a war they couldn't win.

So many Afghans actually sympathize with the Taliban. Second, in territory they occupy, the Taliban force farmers to grow poppies and give the crop to them.  Then it's refined into opium and even further refined into heroin.  That enters the world drug market, earning the Taliban a fortune which they use to purchase guns.  Their weapons are the reason they're so difficult to get rid of. ",

This kid kicked the ant hil, dug his heal into it, and proceeded to systematically slaughter every ant that bit his foot. The kid won, right? I mean by any measure we would say so but as long as there is one, five, or ten ants in some undiscovered tunnel or in the grass that are not stepped on, we havent won. Conversely, just because that kid has a few small ant bites on his foot doesn't mean he is badly beaten. ",

The US Army is not defeating the Taliban in Afghanistan because that is not their aim. Complicated Answer: The US Army has no idea that a sizable percentage of the Afghan population is called, \u201cTaliban\u201d because they attend certain schools and practice a rather strict version of Islam WITHOUT any desire to fight and terrorize and destroy. So! The US Army does not know who its enemy is.The US Army is buried in layers of bureaucracy and democracy (or lack thereof) and hypocrisy. Troops on the ground do not know who they are fighting. But, to make matters really worse, they have no idea WHY they are fighting. War is a profitable business. War keeps people employed. Why end it?Ending here in sympathy with the soldier on ground! Taliban is not a people, it is not a tribe or a village or a nation. Taliban is a phenomenon that will be kept alive, has to be kept alive in order to maintain US presence against several other nations.Period Peace! Oh God Yes! ",

Literacy is low, about 31%.[1] That means that most people only know what they hear from each other, so local leaders have great power. Since Afghanistan is mountainous, even radio and television are often hard to get, so there are few \u201calternative voices\u201d to listen to.

World and USA tried a second track, they asked Pakistan to bring these  Taliban on table, so Pakistan brought them to table, this single act shamed Pakistan world over, and thereafter Pakistan withdrew. Till Pakistan has nuclear weapons world is forced to use kids glove with Pakistan! India is not prepared for a direct confrontation, it is fighting an economic war with Pakistan. Rest of the world is confused, no one knows how to deal with Pakistan. Thus Taliban still exists and thrives in Pakistan, and will never be defeated unless Pakistan defeats them. ",
