            "answer_text": "Yes. It is noteworthy that after the disaster at Teuterberg Wald, where the Roman Army ocuppying Germany east of the Rhine was destroyed, the Romans made no further attempt to conquer Germany, as the Empire lacked sufficient resources to reconquer and hold it. Thereafter the Emperors were generally cautious about further conquests. The exceptions were Claudius who conquered Britain, and Trajan who conquered Dacia(modern Rumania). In the case as to Britain, again there was no attempt made to continue on and conquer what is now Scotland. As to Trajan after he conquered Dacia, he later advanced into what is now Iraq and marched down to the Persian Gulf. However the lands he had passed through quickly revolted, and Trajan was forced to withdraw. His successor Hadrian pulled back the frontiers knowing the Empire had over extended itself. In summary with the exception of Trajan, all the Emperors were conscious of the fact that the Empire\u2019s resources were too limited for further expansion. ",
