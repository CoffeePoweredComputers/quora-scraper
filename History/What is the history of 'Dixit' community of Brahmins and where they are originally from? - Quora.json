            "answer_text": "The dixit community is also known as Dikshit, they are of brahmin lineage. The Dixit surname suggests that somebody in the family lineage, perhaps several generations ago, must have had some form of formal initiation into some religious tradition or studious body of knowledge. Historically, Dixit have been usually associated with professions related to knowledge, teachers and scholars. The word is an adjective form of the sanskrit word diksha, meaning provider of knowledge. Dikshit in Sanskrit derives itself as a person involved in scientific studies, and literally translates as \"one who has received initiation or one who is initiated\". The surname is usually associated with high class Hindu brahmins in India especially in North India. ",

            "answer_text": "If I have read correctly as per our purana the story goes like this that there was a king and there was no rain for years in his kingdom. The purohits advised him that if he can get blessings from some great saint then rain may come. The king approached the saint by name Saubhari Rishi. and he offered him his daughter to marry the Rishi. Marriage took place and as blessing, heavy rains showered through out the state. The descendents of Saubhari rishi were named as Dixit. This is the story I vaguely remember, I may be wrong. ",
