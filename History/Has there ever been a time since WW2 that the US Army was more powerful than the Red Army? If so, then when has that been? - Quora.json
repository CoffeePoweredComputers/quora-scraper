            "answer_text": "Due to the size disparity between the Soviet Union\u2019s Army and the United States Army there was never a question about which was more powerful in total. The Soviets had a long standing advantage. However, there was an ongoing discussion among the military leadership and the Politburo on the effectiveness of the two forces in a shooting war. For many years the Red Army had affirmed the prowess of the Red Army was nearly equal in training, quality of equipment, and tactical ability as the West. There had been plenty of professional literature detailing the relative merit of US and Soviet equipment throughout the Arab-Israeli Wars, Korea, Vietnam, REFORGER exercises and even the Soviet experiences in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Then came the 100-hour blowout of the Soviet equipped Iraqi Army and complete annihilation of the elite Republican Guard whom the Red Army had judged equal to their own Warsaw Pact allies and second-line divisions. You can read it throughout their professional literature at the time. Which means someone from the Red Army in March 1991 had to then brief the Politburo and admit that this perception was false and the US and NATO allied forces were actually far superior in war-fighting ability and technology than they had imagined. Which meant that the 24+ divisions on the Elbe river in Germany weren\u2019t likely to achieve any of their expected objectives in a shooting war they had all believed implicitly for three decades. As a US Army cavalry officer from that time period, I would have loved to be a fly on the wall for THAT briefing! ",

            "answer_text": "While I don't have actual numbers to compare, my feeling is that at no time before, during or after WWII was the US Army more powerful than the Red Army (USSR) in troop numbers, tanks or any of the ways that such things are calculated. There was a brief period right after the war when the US had working nuclear weapons and the Soviet Union did not. While in some ways that made the US Army more powerful, as a (retired) soldier I prefer to consider things such as troop strength over the ability to destroy all living things in a particular country or region. One metric considers military strength while the other only considers only the ability to take life indiscriminately. ",

            "answer_text": "The real question is, does the army of the United States NEED to be \u201cmore powerful\u201d than the Red Army? The Soviet Union (now Russia) is surrounded by long borders with other countries, and some of them have been strong and aggressive in the past. So, by nature, it has always been a country that required a strong land army. The United States traditionally does not have any land enemies, and so the US concentrates on naval and air assets. ",
