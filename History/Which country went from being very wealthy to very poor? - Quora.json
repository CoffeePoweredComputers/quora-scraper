            "answer_text": "Venezuela. During the 50s to the early 90s, Venezuela was one of the best economies in America (The continent) It was probably the most promising economy in all Latin America and compared to the other Latin American countries, we had the best education, public health and GDP. The poor had chances. The poor could stop being poor. I know this because both my parents were raised in poor households and both went to the public school system. Yet they never went hungry, could vacation (Inside the country) and finally did it into the best universities. By age 20 and 30, they both became middle class and by age 30 and 40 they were upper class. Now you see in Venezuela, the minimum wage is at 10$ a month, public schools are brainwashing machines that support the idea of human rights violations, streets are destroyed and children starve to death. But back in the good old days, this was Venezuela.    ",
