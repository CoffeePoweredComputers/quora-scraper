            "answer_text": "Because they were not ready for the war. Oh, I don\u2019t mean in terms of material and training, if that had been the case they would have gone down fighting like the Poles. in fact in many ways the French had more and better weapons than the Nazis. No, the French were not mentally prepared for the war. At the time that the Nazis attacked they were allied with the Russians. So the French Communists were not real keen on fighting. At the same time there was a feeling among French conservatives that the British had pressured them into war. The Germans skillfully played on this with propaganda communicating that the British would make the French do most of the fighting. Finally there was the memory of WW1 which wiped out most of a generation of Frenchmen and which was largely fought on French soil. Put all these things together and it meant that the French lacked the will to fight. Defeatism was prevalent in every level of the French military.It didn\u2019t help that their was no unified command between the French, Dutch British and the Belgians; or that the French army was commanded by a political general who commanded from Paris and refused to use radio communications. I read recently and account from a German officer who accepted the surrender of a large number of French troops. He recounted that the French soldiers had been in the town bars for two days waiting for someone to show up to whom they could surrender. ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer lies in the Blitzkrieg tactics offered by the German Armour, with Motorized and/or Mechanized Infantry formations with effective air support. Plus the inept defensive posture which France used, effectively trying to fight the last war with fixed fortifications (Maginot Line). The French use of Armour was in support of their Infantry while German Infantry supported their Armour. Fairly simplistic answer but I think it sums it up fairly well\u2026.. ",
