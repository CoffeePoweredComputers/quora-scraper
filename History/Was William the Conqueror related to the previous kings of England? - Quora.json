            "answer_text": "William\u2019s wife, Matilda of Flanders, was the daughter of Baldwin V of Flanders, a distant descendant of Alfred the Great through Alfred\u2019s daughter Aelfthryth, who married Baldwin II of Flanders (who was the son of Judith, eldest daughter of Emperor Charles the Bald, Alfred\u2019s step-mother and later sister-in-law, and Baldwin I of Flanders, but that\u2019s s). Unfortunately for William, that\u2019s not how Anglo-Saxon succession worked. William\u2019s claim stemmed from his allegation that his second cousin once removed, Edward the Confessor, King of England, had \u201csecretly\u201d nominated him as heir. Richard I, Duke of Normandy, had two children: Emma of Normandy and Richard II, Duke of Normandy. Emma was married off to Aethelred, King of England, so that he could get the aid of the Normans (former Norsemen) against the Danes (current Norsemen). Emma bore Aethelred sons, including Edward the Confessor. When Cnut, King of Denmark, conquered England, Emma sent her sons to Normandy for safety. Edward, therefore, was raised in Normandy; by the time he became King of the English, after the Danish interlude, he was middle-aged and thoroughly Norman. Although Edward represented the restored House of Wessex, the most powerful House was the House of Godwin, from which came Harold Godwinson, Edward the Confessor\u2019s successor according to the Witangemot, the Anglo-Saxon assembly that decided who would be the next king. The only other eligible member of the House of Wessex around was Edgar Aetheling, the great-grandson of Aethelred the Unready by a different wife, who was deemed too young and had been raised in Hungary in the East through a sequence of events too unlikely for fiction. So Edward\u2019s closest relative with a similar background was his second cousin once removed William. William was the illegitimate son of Robert I, Duke of Normandy, second son of Richard II, Duke of Normandy, and had struggled to reclaim his birthright. Even after the Conquest, his son Henry I of England felt that Englishmen, and particularly Londoners, felt that the children of Malcolm III, king of the Scots, who had married Margaret, sister of the late Edgar Aetheling (last male descendant of the House of Wessex), had a legal claim of the English throne by blood and potential conquest. So Henry married Matilda, the daughter of the king of the Scots, by whom he had \u201cEmpress\u2019 Matilda, from whom all the later royals descend. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes he was. William the Conqueror was the first cousin once removed of Edward the Confessor. Richard II became Duke of Normandy in 996. In 1002 he arranged for his sister, Emma of Normandy, to marry \u00c6thelred ('the Unready'), King of England. Duke Richard's son was Robert, who became Duke of Normandy in his turn in 1027.The son of \u00c6thelred and Emma was Edward ('the Confessor'), who became King of England in 1042. Duke Robert of Normandy and King Edward of England were thus first cousins. This made Duke Robert's son William ('the Bastard)', who became the Duke of Normandy in 1035, the first cousin once removed of King Edward the Confessor. In fact, Edward the Confessor spent most of the first forty years of his life in Normandy, not England, after Canute seized the throne from the Anglo-Saxon monarchy. A major source of friction after he became King of England was the alleged favouritism he showed to Normans, such as making his friend Robert de Jumi\u00e8ges the Archbishop of Canterbury. Duke William wasn't King Edward's closest living relative - that would be Edgar \u00c6theling - but he was more closely related to him by blood than Harold Godwinson! (Harold did, however, become the king\u2019s brother-in- law when Edward married Harold\u2019s sister Edith.) Note also that the direction of the family tree means that none of William\u2019s direct ancestors were kings of England; but rather that the direct ancestors of Edward the Confessor were Dukes of Normandy.
