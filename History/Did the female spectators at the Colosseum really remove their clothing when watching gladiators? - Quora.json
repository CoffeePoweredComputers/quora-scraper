            "answer_text": "Yes. The spectacles were a full service operation, much like Yankee Stadium on the day of a doubleheader. The ladies night throw tokens of clothing down to their favorite armed entertainer or they might arrange to purchase a small token from the lucky gladiator or his lanista. Gladiators rubbed themselves with oil, so a scraping containing the oil mixed with sweat was highly desirable as an aphrodisiac. Of course there were ladies who took off their clothes to entertain select spectators during the fights or perhaps during one of the less exciting moments like the execution of criminals. The Roman's were extreme bons vivants, and were very appreciative of the arousing powers of sex and violence. Thus parts of the Colosseum were set aside for various types of prostitution. Just as at a baseball game, the reveler might purchase some garum before or after indulging in Venus's offerings, then wash that oily, salty fish paste down with the wine of his choice. Since the games could go on for days, the air growing thick with the odors of sex, sweat, vomit, blood and disembowelment, the well heeled fan could plan for and enjoy many hours -- even days, and in some cases like the famous opening festivities -- weeks of gore, food, drink, and lust. Ave Caesar, morituri te salutamus. The philosopher, Seneca, a shrewd investor, could bemoan the spectacles but still grow rich on investing in gladiators. In one of his epistles he tells of a despairing gladiator who didn't want to fight, which could carry a severe penalty. Despite his gory occupation and its code of behavior, this individual retired to the gladiatorial latrines. There he killed himself by ramming a spongia (an ancient version of toilet paper, a sponge on a stick used to clean the privates after responding to nature's call) down his throat, thereby fulfilling his wish to fight no more.

            "answer_text": "Documentary evidence is scarce, but there are hints from Roman sources that this was the case. Gladiators were renowned for their ability to make Roman women swoon. Graffiti from Pompeii describes one fighter who \u201ccatches the girls at night in his net\u201d and another who is \u201cthe delight of all the girls. A certain sort of woman has always got a turn on from this sort of thing. George Orwell wrote that when he was serving in the Home Guard, he was put on sentry duty outside a boxing hall with instructions to stop woman entering, as they behaved inappropriately during the contests. One wishes old George could have been more specific. ",
