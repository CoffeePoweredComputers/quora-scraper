            "answer_text": "When it came to crews the British stood out like a sore thumb, they were extraordinary seamen and fine gunners, this mostly came from the fact that they were constantly sailing and honing their weapon skills. The french were similar ability up until the French Revolution,in the mist of all the executions with the famous guillotine, the people of France got a bit carried away and lopped most of the French aristocracy's head off, the problem was that many of these aristocrats were also naval officers, so they literally got rid of all there knowledge and over-promoted midshipmen became captains and lieutenants. The Spanish Navy was average but were dragged down by the fact that the French Admirals pretty much told them what to do, and they obliged mainly because of the land power France had (Napoleon was in command of the army at the time.). Additionally both French and Spanish crews were blockaded in port months before the Battle of Trafalgar which severely affected their gunnery practice, this had a damaging effect on their performance. Ships on the other hand was a different matter, both the French and Spanish Navy were very good a building ships, the pride of the Spanish navy was the Santissima Trinidad the biggest ship of the age of sail. However by 1770 the Royal Navy had finished their new fleet, based off the designs captured from the French and Spanish ( the HMS Victory itself was a copy of a French ship) with ships now as good as the enemy the British were unstoppable, disatrous defeats for the Franco-Spanish navy were just around the corner, the most notable being the Battle of the Nile where the French Flagship the Orient was destroyed after fire reached it's powder magazine. TL~DR: British had better crew, but the French and Spanish had better ships, however the British copied their designs and then had equally good ones. ",

            "answer_text": "While I don't necessarily disagree with the previous answers, they seem to miss a philosophical point in the difference between the British and the French. Sure, the French built ships for speed and not for strength. Sure, the British built ships to stand in a line of battle. However, there's more to battle than either of these factors. The British ships were excellent for maintaining a line of battle and for sailing at a constant speed under the well trained (mostly, every war did require a certain amount of retraining as there was lots of time in between and before certain commanding officers, gunpowder exercises were not really 'in'). The French ships were meant for speed and assaults which came with that viewpoint -- namely, privateering. Neither is necessarily a weak point or a strong one, but it would depend on how it gets used. The Spaniards decided to build the largest and most powerful ship in that time (Santissima Trinidad) but that does not mean that their general outlook was that the more powerful a ship, the better the fleet. Or, rather, I guess it does. It expresses the fact that they thought four decks are better than three as it would allow for a higher concentration of firepower per ship. However, the Santissima was an incredibly expensive ship for so many different reasons that no country, including Spain which was disadvantaged by its own import of silver from the Americas, could field many of them.  Also, it is not necessarily right to say that the British copied the French designs as their first efforts were generally unsuitable for line-of-battle-combat and only with some effort could they employ the same designs. There are some good examples of the British using captured French ships (the Temeraire) as same class in their own fleet, but these ships were always weaker than home-built ones. In general, the value of the crews would depend on the type of ship they were on, the motivation they had to put in effort (bounty!) as well as their commander.  French sailors from what I have seen were generally of good quality as were the British. The defining quality between these two would have been the officers leading them. No one can really say which one would win in a battle (or what a side would call a victory -- as per the Glorious First of July, which both sides claimed as a success). The Spaniards generally did not appreciate the Bourbon monarch, but were not actively anti-French either -- that is until Napoleon became too power hungry. The Swedes and Russians had their own battles to fight but I have to say that other than the sweeping success of Ehrensv\u00e4rd's shallow water galley fleet. However, that was not to last.  A constant motivation for anyone fighting ships of the Barbary Coast would have been to not surrender for they would be enslaved in that unfortunate instance (although the pirates there were careful in who they would attack and under what circumstances).

            "answer_text": "The qualities of both crews and ships were influenced heavily by the circumstances and the navies of the nations that used them. They also changed over time. The French navy was generally considered to be, and used as, a fast mobile strike force, for reaching a destination quickly and deploying force efficiently. Ships were built for speed and size, and carried larger numbers of crew and marines (naval soldiers) than many other navies of the period. When they were used in this way they often did very well, as in the support of American revolutionary armies in 1781, in Napoleon\u2019s strike against Egypt in 1797\u201398, and in the first months of the Mauritius campaign in 1809. French crews were intensively trained in hand-to-hand combat and sharpshooting. Ironically, this led to a weakening of the French navy under Napoleon, who didn\u2019t understand navies and was constantly drafting these excellent marksmen out of the navy into his land armies. The Dutch navy was constrained by the need for its ships to enter shallow Dutch ports and coastal areas. Hence its ships tended to be smaller than many other navies\u2019, and to have much shallower draughts. Partly in compensation, Dutch ships were heavily armed for their size and crews were intensely trained in gunnery. The British navy, after some disastrous conflicts with the Dutch in the 17th century, focused on seakeeping and dominance. British ships tended to perform better in rough weather, and British crews were trained to stay at sea for comparatively longer periods than most other navies. As a result of this practice, their level of training was often far higher than other navies\u2019, an imbalance that was increased by the British strategy (after the 1780s) of blockading enemy ports for extended periods of time, preventing the enemy crews from training at sea. The Russian navy after the early 17th century was heavily influenced by Peter the Great\u2019s extended incognito stay in Britain, and his admiration of everything about the British navy. Russian ships were often copied from British ship designs, despite a very real difference in naval aims and local conditions. (Russian ships were used a great deal in constricted shallow waters and might have been more effective if copied from Dutch designs, perhaps.) Russian crews were often not terribly well trained or practiced, however. As other answers have indicated, the Spanish navy employed excellent naval architects and builders, and had well trained crews, but during the Napoleonic period they suffered, as the French did, from a lack of live training due to the effects of British blockades, and from the land-based military domination of Spain by France, which very often put Spanish commanders in political subjugation to French aims. Denmark had a pretty good fleet until Britain attacked and burned it in time of peace in 1801. Some excellent sources: Brian Lavery (British navy in Nelson\u2019s time) N.A.M. Rodger (British navy in mid-18th century) Jean Boudriot (French naval architecture) ",

Other continental countries particularly France, although having maritime interests overseas, were more concerned with affairs on the European continent and put their money into large standing armies. Britain ,as an island, only kept a smaller regular force.Some other countries especially Portugal could look to Britain as an ally and rely on its support.It was not until.the twentieth century when Machan's \"The Influence of Sea power on History\" was read in Germany and the USA that things changed and Britain started to lose its dominance.

            "answer_text": "This saying that \"French ships were generally better\" is remarkably persistent. I suspect it's French propaganda., and if they want to go on claiming that, they better come up with an explanation of why the Royal Navy won almost every encounter between British and French ships in that period. Yes, the French ships were finished by the shipwrights to a higher standard - but the French shipwrights/naval architects of the time were doggedly convinced that to be superior, a ship had to be fast, which was a complete misunderstanding of what was important in the naval warfare of the time. Every ship is a compromise, and when you go for speed, you cut down on weight, which makes your ship physically weaker, less able to stand up to the kind of pounding the naval gunnery of the time dished out. So if the French stood their ground, they got pounded to pieces; if they ran, they could sail away. But you can't rule the seas by running away. So no, the French ships weren't \"better\"; they could not do the job required, which makes them worse than useless. ",
