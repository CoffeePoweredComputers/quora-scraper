            "answer_text": "The Age of Exploration is a kind of informal, or it should be, description of European moving across the world starting in the mid fifteenth century. It lasted about two hundred years after which most places had been \u201cdiscovered\u201d. Or what was going on was not \u201cexploring\u201d in the sense of seeing what was out there so much as going out to what was known and occasionally finding more stuff. But there was Capt. Cook\u2019s voyage who found places which others may have found earlier but the word didn\u2019t get out or nobody was or could afford to be interested. A good round up is Parry, \u201cThe Age of Reconnaisance\u201d It\u2019s about the European movement 1450\u20131650. Lots to do with development of deep sea sailing, navigation, voyages, etc. Problem is, people had been discovering things all over the world for a very long time. Whether there was a concerted, or loosely organized, or coincidental arrangement of several countries with a goal of exploration\u2014as opposed to exploitation, trade, war, conquest, or getting lost,, you probably won\u2019t find. In the eighteenth century, and early nineteenth, European navies discovered\u2014for Europeans, lots of people if only the natives living there knew about them\u2014while on the usual naval duties. Once in a while, a naval expedition if only one ship was directed to find out what was\u2026.south and more south and\u2026..there was Antarctica. But see Parry. ",
