            "answer_text": "In the beginning of professional military service in Rome, Gaius Marius was paying ordinary legionnaires 225 denarii per year. It stayed at that level until Domitian some 180 years later increased it to 300 and another 120 years later Septimius Severus increased it to 500. After that the Roman state was gripped by runaway inflation and soldiers pay was frequently increased. That was for an ordinary legionnaires. Specialists, soldiers with some special skill, like skilled blacksmiths, builders, ballista operators, scribes, etc. received double pay. Aquilifer, Signifier and junior officers, squad leaders, received several times soldiers pay. Centurions received 20 times soldiers pay. Senior centurions, cohort leaders even more, and Primus pilus, the most senior centurio of the legion received even more. In addition to that, soldiers received a large discharge bonus, which was somewhere around 10-15 years pay or a plot of good land. Furthermore, soldiers received donatives on emperor accession or on important emperor's occasions. In addition to that, when on active campaign, soldiers were given a share of war spoils, sometimes they were allowed to loot and rob civilians in enemy territory. If slaves were captured, they were sold and soldiers were given a share of the proceeds. Donatives and spoils of war were shared using the same ratios as basic pay; specialists got twice what ordinary soldiers got, centurions got 20 times and so on. So soldiering could be a lucrative profession if you were in the right place at the right time. If you were, for example, in the army of Septimius Severus in the year of the 5 emperors, then you were given donatives from all the preceding emperors on their accession, and at the end you fought a victorious campaign, got some loot and some war spoils, and finally the accession bonus from Severus himself. That was a good year to be a soldier in one of Severus' legions. When the 3rd Punic war broke out, there were too many volunteers for the campaign. Everyone expected a quick victory over a very wealthy city and a large share in the spoils of war. That was actually what attracted the soldiers during the republic. If a general was setting out on a good campaign that promised a lot of loot and slaves, then he got many volunteers for his legions. ",

In spite of the steady inflation during the 2nd century, there was no further rise until the time of Septimius Severus, who increased it to 500 denarii a year. However, the soldiers did not receive all the money in cash, as the state deducted their pay with a clothing and food tax. To this wage, a legionary on active campaign would hope to add the booty of war, from the bodies of their enemies and as plunder from enemy settlements. Slaves could also be claimed from the prisoners of war and divided amongst the legion for later selling, which would bring in a sizeable supplement to their regular pay. All legionary soldiers would also receive a praemia on the completion of their term of service: a sizable sum of money (3000 denarii from the time of Augustus) and/or a plot of good farmland (good land was in much demand); farmland given to veterans often helped in establishing control of the frontier regions and over rebellious provinces. Later, under Caracalla, the praemia increased to 5,000 denarii. Roman legion ",
