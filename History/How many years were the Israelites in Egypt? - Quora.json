            "answer_text": "According to the Bible, the Israelites were in Egypt 430 years, but this creates a contradiction elsewhere, because the biblical genealogy says that Moses must have been dead long before the Exodus from Egypt\u2014that is the problem with creating complex chronologies when you do not carefully check what you have written. By medieval times, Jewish sages were beginning to recognise this, and appear to have come up with a partial solution. David Goldstein (Jewish Mythology) says that in the document known as Exodus Rabbah (3:3-4) Moses protested that the 400 years of oppression that God had foretold to Abraham had not yet elapsed, and God responded that the time of oppression had to be dated from the birth of Isaac, and so 400 years had indeed gone by. Nearly all historians` now recognise that the Israelites were never in Egypt. The stories of the patriarchs, Joseph in Egypt and the Exodus under Moses simply form a national foundation myth developed long after the Israelites had forgotten their real origins as Canaanite peasants.
