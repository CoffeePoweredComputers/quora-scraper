            "answer_text": "No. And the world would likely be a generally far better place today.  File:Newspaper Headline--Germany Asks Peace On Wilson's 14 Points.jpg Clearly, Woodrow Wilson\u2019s proposition was far more amenable to German interests than the Treaty of Versailles. Though often criticized as being idealistic, in retrospect the points appear pragmatic and illuminated. The language regarding Germany from his January 8, 1918 speech that set forth the 14 points is illuminating: For such arrangements and covenants we are willing to fight and to continue to fight until they are achieved; but only because we wish the right to prevail and desire a just and stable peace such as can be secured only by removing the chief provocations to war, which this programme does remove. We have no jealousy of German greatness, and there is nothing in this programme that impairs it. We grudge her no achievement or distinction of learning or of pacific enterprise such as have made her record very bright and very enviable. We do not wish to injure her or to block in any way her legitimate influence or power. We do not wish to fight her either with arms or with hostile arrangements of trade if she is willing to associate herself with us and the other peace- loving nations of the world in covenants of justice and law and fair dealing. We wish her only to accept a place of equality among the peoples of the world, -- the new world in which we now live, -- instead of a place of mastery. President Woodrow Wilson's 14 Points (1918) Contrast the posture of this speech with the antiseptic language of the Treaty of Versailles: Article 231 (pp. 137\u2013138) The Allied and Associated Governments affirm and Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies. https://www.loc.gov/law/help/us-treaties/bevans/m-ust000002-0043.pdf What does not come across from any short excerpt of the Treaty is that Article 231 appears at roughly the mid-point of the treaty at the start of the portion labeled REPARATION. The entire remainder of the Treaty is focused on reparations and financial arrangements. Anger and the unwillingness to begin reconciliation drips from the pages like blood from a dying bull at the end of a bullfight. Do not forget that the 14 Points were about much more than just Germany. It was the articulation of a completely new vision for the what we glibly call the World Order. The League of Nations was merely the most prominent and important of his international policy points. Wilson\u2019s vision was one of self-determination of national fealty rather than one of a world ordered by \u201cmastery\u201d. The world needed a strong dose of idealism in 1919. In 1919, the world was tired and angry. Germany and her allies certainly deserved to be called to account for their actions, but in their anger, the victors extracted more retribution than what could be borne. Had the treaty been shaped by the 14 Points, it is likely that Wilson\u2019s momentum would have carried the day and the United States would have joined the league as well. A new, but weak Soviet Union, may have joined as well to enjoy that potential security the League would offer. A League so empowered may well have had the legitimacy to contain Nazi expansionism. It is easy to ride the alt-history train too far. One can imagine a stronger and less fragile Weimar Germany that may have held together well enough to become the liberal democracy that Germany is today. Absent the pretext provided by the Second World War, the Soviet Union might have stayed within its early 20th Century borders averting the Cold War. Other peripheral Wilsonian initiatives may have quieted other conflicts before they began such as in Kosovo and the Levant. But there is a major stop on the alt-history train that one cannot ignore: the Great Depression. Might the Great Depression have been mitigated, especially in Germany, had the 14 Points guided in 1919? Perhaps. Perhaps Germans who were a little less hungry and a little more hopeful would not have turned to the man who offered hope seasoned by a little old-fashioned hate. It is hard to really understand all of the impacts. The accounting for the payment of reparations by Germany is so complex that rendering a firm conclusion regarding the effects vexes even the experts. Through many convolutions, Germany did repay much of what the Treaty of Versailles demanded. The debt obligations even survived the Second World War. But the debt was eventually settled. The date of that settlement is both shocking and informative. October 3, 2010. Would Wilson\u2019s 14 Points have made an impact? No doubt. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe a more effective applications of the 14 points would have been positive. Actually, most of the points were included in the Versailles treaty BUT they were not well accepted because of lack of buy-in and follow through. Who is responsible for the difficult application of the idealistic plan? First and foremost: Germany or rather Ludendorff! The 14 points were presented by Wilson January 8th, 1918. If Ludendorff had seized the moment to start peace negociations, Germany had a chance for an honourable peace. Instead, he believed he could benefit from Russia\u2019s collapse (that he had engineered) to rush troops West and make a strong offensive. The German war objective was still to make Germany the dominant European power with France, Belgium and Netherlands vassal states. Germany should have abandoned its dreams of dominating Europe and asked for an armistice in spring. It was too late in October. By then it had clearly lost but Ludendorff refused to accept defeat; neither did the Kaiser who fled. The new republic was accused of stabbing the military in the back.The European Empires (Austria-Hungary, Russia, Turkey and Germany again) who should have accepted to dismantle and cooperate intelligently to create new nation states. Given the intricacy of population residence, strong international coordination would have been required. (Point VI to XIII)The United States. If the United States had ratified the treaty and actively participated in the League of Nations. The treaty would have evolved and been applied more pragmatically. (Point I, IV, V, XIV)France and the United Kingdom who should have followed suit and start dismantling their own global empires. (Point V)The United States and the rest of the world who should have resisted the urge of mercantilism when the great depression hit (Point III) and not to rearm (Point IV).The only major issue which was not part of the initial 14 points was the need to compensate France (and Belgium) for suffering all the damages of the war in the West. There was a consensus on the matter and the issue appears rather common sensical except for some Quora writers for reasons I fail to understand. In fact, the oft blamed (in) famous article 231 was written by the American delegation (Norman Davis and John Foster Dulles) and considered by all parties as a pure technicality, used in all treaties as a legal clause justifying reparations. Only Germany reacted because it was in denial of defeat and - at least subconsciously - planning for second round. It seems totally unrealistic to consider WWI could have ended without France and Belgium receiving any reparation for the damages. Blaming Versailles for bringing WWII is very uninformed and/or very wicked Nazi propaganda. ",
