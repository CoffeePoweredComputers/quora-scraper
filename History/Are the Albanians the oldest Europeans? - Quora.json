            "answer_text": "Question: Are Albanians the oldest Europeans? Short answer: Not exactly. Long answer: Basque and Caucasian people are the oldest in Europe, because they are the only pre-Indo-Europeans in the continent, however, Albanians are the oldest or one of the oldest in the Balkans. But\u2026 are Albanians the oldest I.E. in Europe? Unfortunately no, Albanian is a semi-Romanized language, ~1/3 of our vocabulary derives from Latin, other influences arrives also from Slavic, Germanic, Hellenic and Turkic languages, maybe Celtic and Indo-Iranic influenced Albanian too, so, our language lost many of its original characteristics, don't forget that we mixed with the pre-Indo-European populations of the Balkans (Pelasgians), so we are not the oldest I.E. in Europe, but we are the oldest in the Balkans. The ancient Thracians, Illyrians and Dacians form a possible I.E. branch called \u201cThraco-Illyrian\u201d, and arrived in the Balkans more than 3000 years ago, maybe 5000, however, one of those populations mixed with ancient Pelasgians and thanks to them we have the ancestors of modern Albanians.  Baltic languages (especially Lithuanian) are more closer to proto-I.E., they were conquered many \u201cfew\u201d times than Albanians, so, their language has less foreign loanwords, but despite that, they absorbed a pre-I.E. population as well, a substrate was found, and it is pretty similar to the same substrate found in Saami and Balto-Finnic languages, is possible that the same pre-Indo-European population inhabited both Fenno-Scandia and the Baltic? We don't know! However, Balto-Slavic languages and Albanian share many things in common, Germanic languages shares many features as well, more than other I.E. languages, so, we and the Baltics are the oldest I.E. in Europe, but Baltics are a bit older than us, and as I said before, Caucasian languages and Basque still living in their respective territories before us I.E. started to spread among Eurasia, but we still one of the oldest in the Balkans!

Europe is a very diverse continent A melting pot of culture such as the Mediterranean such as myself. I am Italiana aka a TRUE Latina unlike the North Americans theory of what and where Latin Heritage is and comes from which is HISTORICALLY ROME ITALY LATIN EUROPE. Next I am Italo-Albanian and Sicilian TWO very old and VERY COMMON peoples in the TRUE Latino culture of Italy. It seems people believe People who descend from ANCIENT Albanians are the oldest INDIGENOUS people of Europe an the Albanian language is actually older than The Latin language. Many migrations happened from Albania to Italy we come from The Illyrians and are one of the original Latin tribes people from Illyria in Italian-Latin culture. There are many people who have ancestry from Albania today but do Not descend from the Original ancient Albanian people because many of us migrated to Italy and other Mediterranean areas in smaller groups. Southern Italy is mainly where we are and there are many Albanian community\u2019s in southern Italy. My Albanian family migrated in 100Ad for religious reasons due to converting to acknowledging Jesus Christ as the son of God and if all Albanians who converted to Christ did NOT leave Albania then we would be put to death so Boats loads full of Albanians left and where granted asylum I\u2019m Campania and that is where the town Greci was Born and there are other community\u2019s in Sicily (southern Europe) this was just one of the many migrations Albanians have been a huge part of Italian culture looong before 100AD. We are known to be very old to the European continent. European means a place where ones culture finally settle and Became more Historical it does NOT define Genetic contributors My ethnicity is Latin because I come from EXOTIC Italian culture my Features are Brown as Latin Blood ethnicity is Latina. And as a Ethnic Mediterranean person my DNA is very complex and mixed and this is HISTORICAL and modern such as Middle Eastern/Arabic, asian, African, Indigenous Eastern European, and other Indigenous Mediterranean contributors all mixed together. The Mediterranean has always been a melting pot of culture it\u2019s Nothing new if you\u2019re educated and as it being my culture I am proud and educated two things that are rare in The USA. ",

            "answer_text": "Genetically, this question doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, since Europeans are pretty much very well intermixed, even moreso in the case of Mediterranean populations (the Romans did a rather thorough and good job at that). So I guess this is more a question from a linguistic/cultural angle. Albanians are Indo-European. The ancestors of the Albanians reached Europe most likely at some time around 3000~6000 years ago; just like ancient Greeks, what would become Germanic, Balto-Slavic, Celtic and Italic tribes and other now extinct Indo-European branches (like Hittites) settled other areas of Europe. But they weren\u2019t the first settlers, there were already non-Indo-Erupean peoples in Europe (Etruscans, Iberians, Aquitanians, Minoans, Raetics, Nuraghics, Tartesians\u2026). Only one European language and culture from before the arrival of Indo-Europeans has survived to this day: Basque. So, if there\u2019s such a thing as \u201coldest European people\u201d, that would definitely be the Basques. ",

Basques have almost certainly been in Europe longer than any Indo-European culture, including Albanians. Albanians did clearly get to southeast Europe before the Slavs and Germans did, but there is nothing to suggest (that I\u2019ve ever read) that they got there before the Greeks or Celts. It\u2019s largely uncertain because it is unclear who they were in the ancient world. The first clear reference to modern Albanians is by Byzantine historians just 1000 years ago. They may be descendants of Thracians or Illyrians or a different group entirely. There just isn\u2019t the evidence to say, even though that doesn\u2019t stop plenty of armchair historians from pretending they know the answer. ",

That's like asking if Kenyans are the oldest Africans, when there have been many different people during different periods. Albanians, Bosnians and Croats all have percentages ofIllyrian ancestry depending on each person. So yes they belong to one of the oldest Indo-European ethnic groups but they're not solely the oldest. ",

No one really knows the origins of Albanians. Albanians are taught in schools that they are descended from Illyrians but no proof has been given. No one even knows for certain who or what the Illyrians were to begin with, no writing survives or they never used any. All that remains is foreign descriptions of them such as from the Greeks. For all anyone knows the Illyrians may have not even been one people. The way I see it is this, Albanians just showed up suddenly exactly like in the documents. Unfortunately this is a mystery that may not be solved. ",
