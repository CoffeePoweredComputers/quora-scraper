            "answer_text": "This answer depends on two things: first, do you recognize for the record someone who never held the unified or undisputed title? For those who recognize someone who held only part of the title, it is Wlad Klitschko. He held part of the title for 4,382 days. For most of that time however, his brother, who most people, (including Manny Steward) believed could have beaten him, also held a portion of the title. And for the entire time he held part of the title, someone else held part of it. He never unified the title nor was he undisputed champion, or undisputedly the best heavyweight in the world. Which brings us to number two, should Wlad's record count when for 2,735 of those days, your big brother holds a portion of the title, and most people in the game believed that big brother could have defeated you? To me, that simply is not the same as holding the unified, undisputed, title. Teddy Atlas put it best: \"when Joe Louis or Ali held the undisputed title, there never was any doubt who \"the man\" was. When Wlad Klitschko held the title, there was doubt. His brother towered over him, literally.\" For the record, I personally recognize, as do many historians, Joe Louis Barrow. Louis, held the title for 4,270 consecutive days, won 26 championship fights, and defended the undisputed, unified, championship 25 times. For runner up, I personally recognize, again, as do many historians, Muhammad Ali, who held the title twice, beat 21 fighters for the title, and won 19 unified and undisputed title bouts. Ali held the title three times, the first time until stripped of the title for resisting draft induction. He held the title the second time from October 30, 1974, till February 15, 1978. He regained it the last time on September 15, 1978, and held it until his second retirement on July 27, 1979, a period of 3,343 days. I recognize that many people will disagree, but I think there is a clear difference between holding the unified, undisputed championship, and holding an alphabet title, or two, or three. The fact was that Wlad never held the WBC title, and for most of his reign was not considered able to defeat that champion, his brother, Vitali. ",

            "answer_text": "Answer depend on what you mean by the word \u201ctitle\u201d. The are to many titles nowadays. Actually the are at least 5 major - WBC, WBA super, WBA regular, IBF, WBO. And current state of heaviweight disision is miserable and was the same for more than decade. Level of skills constantly decreasing and level of competition is low. John McGlothlin made a good point here, I only can add a few things. By numbers only, longest continous hold ot title was Joe Luis achivment, but he never defend it for more than 4 years due to War, so his ACTIVE reign was about 7 and half years, abous the same that Ali\u2019s. But he was DOMINAT champion most of his reign: the was no active fighters with good chanses agains him most of that time (Charles and Wallkot was near the end). Klitchko (hold IBF title for 9 and half years), but most of the time he was in shadow of his big brother (by the way, only fighter whoose legasy based on a loss to old fat unmotivated champion). More important Wladimir never was truly dominant. He was anihilated by Sanders and got big troubles against very moderate Peter, Brewster and Williamson (he does beat Peter and Brewster when they were clearly finished as a fighters). Anyway, Wladimir was the longest reigning ACTIVE champion with part of the title. Ali was champion for more than a 7 years, but this number exludes years of his forced lay-off. If Ali activity never was interrupted he may be dominant champ for 13\u201314 years (1964\u20131978), or even more. And Ali\u2019s opposition was one of the best of all-time, even in p4p terms : he face 4 out off 10 best fighters in the history of his division (3 were in their prime while Ali clearly was not) and beat 3 of them. So, longest reigning champion was Lous, but his reign incluge 4 year interrupion with now defences. Longest hold of one of the titles and longest ACTIVE inerterupted reign was achived by Wladimir Klitchko. But Ali\u2019s achivement is greater by far. ",
