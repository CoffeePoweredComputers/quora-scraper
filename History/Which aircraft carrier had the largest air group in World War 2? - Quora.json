Wikipedia entry for USS Bunker Hill (CV-17) showed Air Group 84 having 93 aircraft, but listed 103 by aircraft type. Both air groups were augmented with two Marine Corp squadrons each. And both carriers were victims of kamikaze. Other carriers with 100+ air groups in that battle include: USS Essex (102), USS Bennington (102), USS Hornet II (101), and USS Wasp II (100) Okinawa naval order of battle - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that a specific answer is probably immaterial as the number of aircraft embarked on any specific carrier changes day-to-day if not hour-to-hour. In addition, authorized strengths rarely, if ever, give a realistic number on hand. That said, however, I would say one of the U.S. Navy\u2019s ESSEX class. Designed for 80\u201390 aircraft, some of them were operating up to 105 aircraft in 1945. Of course, these numbers exasperated the already crowded conditions for the crew. Those numbers were predicated for ships designed in the late 1930\u2019s - before the considerable addition of dozens of light anti-aircraft guns and before addition of multiple radar sets with their attendant requirements for operators and repair technicians. No other carrier class during the war came even close to those numbers; either because of design limitations (British ILLUSTRIOUS class), operational policy (Japanese SHOKAKU class, the nearest equivalent to the ESSEX class) or inability to produce enough aircraft (Japanese).
