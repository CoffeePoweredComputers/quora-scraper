            "answer_text": "I don't think most of us give much of a thought to this but it always depends. At worst, I'd say there may be somewhat of an ingrained dislike due to tradition. After all, the Catholic Kings, the Inquisition and all the mandataries that followed did everything they could to squander the Islamic influences in Spain's culture. This started before the end of the 15th century as the territories were being conquered again by Christianity so, as other users have pointed out, most won't probably consider their Islamic pasts. I wouldn't be surprised if I had Muslim forefathers but they must have lived so many generations ago that it really doesn't matter. I'd just love to be able to know more about the culture of my country during the Islamic period. Specially the story of Madrid, which was founded by Muslims and yet I have found this to be quite complicated, there's only a select few books and publications that tell about this (and some are even out of print!!). My mother is however in the completely opposite mindset when it comes to her roots: 'The moors didn't reach the area where my family comes from' she always claims proudly. This seems so silly to me: how do you know that your family always lived there? (Because she doesn't, don't come telling me that there could be a census or whatever because all I know is that she hasn't ever traced her family tree) What's more, who cares? Does it somehow define you as a Spaniard living in the 21st century that your great-grandparents who lived several centuries ago were originally from another country and were Muslim? ",

            "answer_text": "Our relationship to our Islamic past is akin to the relationship that Turks have with their Byzantine past or that the French have with their Roman past. Historical rivalries are just that: Historical. Only extremely stupid, hateful people carry grudges for centuries. Most of us don\u2019t. For the vast majority of Spaniards, our Islamic past is a precious part of our cultural heritage. We view Al Andalus under the same light that we view the Roman Empire: invaders that civilized us and contributed to define our identity, at least to some degree.  The mosque of Cordoba, the pinnacle of moorish architecture, and one of Spain\u2019s national monuments So even if we identify ourselves more with the Christian Kingdoms and our Roman ancestors since our culture is European, it is our Islamic past and the whole confluence of different cultures inside our small peninsula what set us appart from other European countries.  Covadonga sanctuary, where the reconquista stared. Another Spanish national monument, every bit as Spanish as the Cordoba\u2019s mosque Spain was born inside this glorious clash of extremely different cultures. No homogeneous bloodlines with pedigree for us, we are mestizo mutts and proud of it. So while we don\u2019t have a single parent culture, Al Andalus is certainly one of them, and it is as important as the others. Spanish romanticism on the 19th century drank copiously from our Islamic past, hence the neo-mud\u00e9jar architectural style. The Alhambra is our most visited national monument, second only to la Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. So you can\u2019t remove our Islamic past without turning ourselves into a different country altogether.  Las Ventas bullring in Madrid, a fine example of neo-mudejar architecture, clearly inspired in our Islamic heritage  The Alhambra patio de los leones, an otherworldly sight straight out of some Arabian Night tale. It is our national pride\u2026 and our national beer as well! Nowadays, some of our regions like Andalusia closely relates their identity to said Islamic past, in contrast with other northern regions such as Asturias, which identify more with the reconquista, or the Basque Country, one of the most Catholic of all our regions. None of them is \u201cmore Spanish\u201d than the other. And that\u2019s what makes Spain\u2026 well, Spain. ",
