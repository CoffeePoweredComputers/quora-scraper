            "answer_text": "Yes of course Well this answer is going to be long\u2026.But if you read carefully then you will come to know about the true history and also come to know about whom to worship and whom to know whom to respect and whom to not\u2026 Yes Gandhi was surely a badass person and the Biggest Traitor in the History\u2026 Now let us make his unknown truth naked. HIS DISCIPLE One of the one of the Gandhi's disciples was Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Pandit for namesake,. Jawaharlal Nehru was a pedophile and belong to a rich family who always craved for enjoyments and pleasures. He never sacrificed anything for the country , lived in a place which is called Anand Bhawan which is located in Delhi it's such a magnificent place. His belongings are also preserved in Anand Bhawan and if you visit the place you will come to know how rich life he lived. He was fond of rich cars. At the same time if you look at the life of Bhagat Singh Ji or Chandrashekhar Azad or Pandit Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil ji or any of the great freedom fighters you will come to know that they had sacrificed everything for the motherland At the time of independence he badly demanded to be the Prime Minister of India. No one liked him. There was an election for who would be the Prime Minister of India in which Jawaharlal Nehru security only two votes out of 15 where as Sardar Patel secured 13 votes. When he didn't win election hi started torturing mentally to all of the members that he would bring back the Britishers is he was not made prime minister. And his so called Guru Gandhi didn't stop him\u2026**GOD OF TRUTH** That was his traitor disciple\u2026 Now let us talk about now let's talk about him. GANDHI IN HIS YOUTH He went to England to become a England to become a barrister. So it can be understood that he was like a common man, craving to earn his livelihood. He was not enlightened enough to do something for freedom\u2026 On the other hand if we see other freedom fighters like Bhagat singh ji, Chandrashekhar Azad ji or any of them, they had dreamt to get freedom right from their childhood. Yes, though a Vaishya he eat meat to please his tongue and smoked and drank\u2026 He never had a slight Urge for freedom. IN HIS POWER He had done so many scams throughout his life that most people don't know. THE God Of NONVIOLENCEHe helped the Britishers so that they could win the World War 2 ,by sending Indian people to them to fight\u2026For the Britishers. Gandhi told everybody that \u201cif we help the Britishers they would give us Freedom.\u201d Was he that much stupid that he blindly agreed to what they said??? No, it was a complete conspiracy \u2026.he had his friendship with the Britishers. Now let me make clear what is Violence. violence is something that is done against the truth. Do you think that the other freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh ji were violent? It is said that Gandhi used to read Bhagavad Gita but where's the proof? In Bhagavad Gita Shri Krishna told that raising weapons against the bad is not violence but Self defence and it was done by the true freedom fighters\u2026. I don't think that Gandhi had ever touched Bhagvad Gita in his entire life. Ha Ha Ha he was the god of Non-Violence\u2026 2. Serial Murders of Freedom Fighters now I am now I am going to tell you that he had murdered many of the great freedom fighters directly and indirectly\u2026 I) Shaheed e Azam Bhagat Singh Ji , Sukhdev ji and Rajguru ji There was an immense popularity of Bhagat Singh Ji of which Gandhi was jealous of. He claimed that he tried a lot to save Bhagat Singh Ji but it's all a drama. Many of his close Associates agreed that he did not show up much attention on this topic that is to save Bhagat Singh Ji. Moreover he demanded the British government to hang Bhagat Singh Ji 2 days before its date because there were elections going to be held in Punjab\u2026 II) Chandra Shekhar Azad Very few people know about the tragedy of Chandra Shekhar Azad's death. Chandrashekhar Azad ji had gone to Anand Bhawan which is now in present Delhi\u2026Anand Bhawan was the residence of Jawaharlal Nehru.He wanted to meet Jawaharlal Nehru and wanted to team up to fight with the Britishers. He left Anand Bhawan and thereafter went to Alfred Park where he shot himself as the British troops approached there to arrest him.Jawaharlal Nehru told Britishers that he had come and then where he was going to. Jawaharlal Nehru and Gandhi were very close to each other, Gandhi would have stopped him but he also wanted Chandrashekhar Azad ji to be dead\u2026 Forceful resignation of Subhas Chandra Bose Everyone loved Subhas Chandra Bose ji in the Congress Party and he was elected as the President but Gandhi and Nehru did not like him and Gandhi forced him to resign. After leaving the Congress party Subhash Chandra Bose ji founded his own party called as the FORWARD BLOC. As the destroyer of Hinduism He had a tremendous love for Islam. In the name of Hindu Muslim Unity he made Hindus sing the Prayers of Allah. and that's the most shameful thing for Hindus that they were singing Muslim prayers in their own temples. He didn't make Muslims sing Hindu prayers in their mosques. That's complete injustice.  Partition 1947:- At the time of partition of India lacs of Hindu women with children were refugees from Pakistan. They had taken refuge in some places. Gandhi immediately ordered them to go back in Pakistan in the middle of a cold night\u2026. Murder of Swami Shraddhanand For brief information Swami shraddhanand was one of the Hindu lions\u2026 As you know most of Indian Muslims are converted Muslims.Swami Shraddhanand head converted more than 15 lakh Muslims back to Hinduism. Once he gave speech standing on the top of a Muslim building once he gives speech standing on the top of a Muslim building. This thing irritated Gandhi. There was a close friend of Gandhi called Abdul Rashid\u2026He toodidn't like this ,so both involved in a conspiracy to kill Swami shraddhanand and finally they got him a dagger stabbed and murdered this Lion. Khudiram Bose Controversy Khudiram Bose was the youngest Khudiram Bose was the youngest freedom fighter who was just 17 years when he was hanged. He dropped a bomb on the Britishers but accidentally it killed two British women. And thus he was hanged. Badass Gandhi statement on this and \u201clamented the loss of two innocent woman\u201d.Yes he didn't care about the loss of Khudiram Bose. Britishers had too killed our Indian women lacs of time. So this statement really doesn't make any sense ,it's just an intention to support the Britishers\u2026 So this is all about Badass Gandhi, I have put much of my efforts to write this answer. So let this effort be successful. Share this answer link to everyone and do upvote if you liked. \u201cLET THE TRUTH SHINE\u201d THANKS References:-         ",

            "answer_text": "Unpopular answer here. In my opinion, he was right in killing Gandhi, because at the time there was no other alternative. He said it clearly, there was no legal machinery to hold Gandhi accountable for the huge loss caused to India due to appeasement politics, and he knew that Gandhi would go down as a hero in history being dead or alive. But he figured out, it was better a dead Gandhi as hero. A living Gandhi would risk the nation by giving encouragement to separatists by appeasing them. Hence, he had to gather guts and fire those fatal shots. People think Nathuram Godse killed Gandhi because of jealousy with his popularity, which in my view, is a wrong assumption. Everything he (Godse) said about Jinnah\u2019s iron will, Muslim League\u2019s zero concern for Gandhi\u2019s fasts, and Godlike status is the absolute truth. The Muslim League didn\u2019t care about Gandhi at all, his (Gandhi\u2019s) cowardice helped them (League) carry on with their ideas about the Two nation theory. There are many accounts in the history of partition to confirm these truths. Gandhi didn\u2019t visualize what path he was taking India on, and most of his ideals were lofty in a world of the survival of the fittest, fastest and smartest. If Gandhi would have stayed for longer, he would have just given away whatever the Muslim League asked, in search of appeasement and popularity and from fear of violent reprisals. Remember \u201cDirect action day\u201d? Later on, many other uprisings would have happened because everyone wanted a piece of the country when the British decided to leave. Essentially it was a bunch of thieves just wanting their share of the Independence of the Dominion of India, from Great Britain. The thieves that inherited India from the British were the Nehru-Gandhi family, which are today the owners of the Congress party. The thieves of the Muslim League got Pakistan. Muslim League was conducting their usual politics in the guise of religious beliefs, and they were employing all means necessary to further their cause. Gandhi was a populist and a fool, and the problem with populists is that they are selfish, impractical and lack vision. He was the most useful tool ever to be used by the people responsible for the partition of India. The sad part of this is that there are many martyrs who gave their life ahead of Independence, but their pictures don't hang in every police station; they don't have as many statues as Gandhi has all over India. The right wing is not racist or communal, it just doesn\u2019t believe in appeasement. Appeasement would only work if it is for a much bigger purpose, but with politicians, appeasement works only for their personal gains in money or power, at the expense of everything else.  Here is his speech on why I killed Gandhi: Nathuram Godse: 'May it Please Your Honour', Why I killed Gandhi - 1948 5 May 1949, Punjab High Court, Peterhoff, Simia, India Nathuram Godse assassinated Gandhiji on 30 January 1948. The trial began on 27 May 1948 and concluded on 10 February 1949. He was sentenced to death. An appeal to the Punjab High Court, then in session at Simla, did not find favour and the sentence was upheld. This statement is the last made by Godse before the Court. WHY I KILLED GANDHI Born in a devotional Brahmin family, I instinctively came to revere Hindu religion, Hindu history and Hindu culture. I had, therefore, been intensely proud of Hinduism as a whole. As I grew up I developed a tendency to free thinking unfettered by any superstitious allegiance to any isms, political or religious. That is why I worked actively for the eradication of untouchability and the caste system based on birth alone. I openly joined RSS wing of anti-caste movements and maintained that all Hindus were of equal status as to rights, social and religious and should be considered high or low on merit alone and not through the accident of birth in a particular caste or profession. I used publicly to take part in organized anti-caste dinners in which thousands of Hindus, Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, Chamars and Bhangis participated. We broke the caste rules and dined in the company of each other. I have read the speeches and writings of Ravana, Chanakiya, Dadabhai Naoroji, Vivekanand, Gokhale, Tilak, along with the books of ancient and modern history of India and some prominent countries like England , France , America and Russia . Moreover I studied the tenets of Socialism and Marxism. But above all I studied very closely whatever Veer Savarkar and Gandhiji had written and spoken, as to my mind these two ideologies have contributed more to the moulding of the thought and action of the Indian people during the last thirty years or so, than any other single factor has done. All this reading and thinking led me to believe it was my first duty to serve Hindudom and Hindus both as a patriot and as a world citizen. To secure the freedom and to safeguard the just interests of some thirty crores (300 million) of Hindus would automatically constitute the freedom and the well-being of all India , one fifth of human race. This conviction led me naturally to devote myself to the Hindu Sanghtanist ideology and programme, which alone, I came to believe, could win and preserve the national independence of Hindustan , my Motherland, and enable her to render true service to humanity as well. Since the year 1920, that is, after the demise of Lokamanya Tilak, Gandhiji\u2019s influence in the Congress first increased and then became supreme. His activities for public awakening were phenomenal in their intensity and were reinforced by the slogan of truth and non-violence which he paraded ostentatiously before the country. No sensible or enlightened person could object to those slogans. In fact there is nothing new or original in them.. They are implicit in every constitutional public movement. But it is nothing but a mere dream if you imagine that the bulk of mankind is, or can ever become, capable of scrupulous adherence to these lofty principles in its normal life from day to day. In fact, honour, duty and love of one\u2019s own kith and kin and country might often compel us to disregard non-violence and to use force. I could never conceive that an armed resistance to an aggression is unjust. I would consider it a religious and moral duty to resist and, if possible, to overpower such an enemy by use of force. [In the Ramayana] Rama killed Ravana in a tumultuous fight and relieved Sita.. [In the Mahabharata], Krishna killed Kansa to end his wickedness; and Arjuna had to fight and slay quite a number of his friends and relations including the revered Bhishma because the latter was on the side of the aggressor. It is my firm belief that in dubbing Rama, Krishna and Arjuna as guilty of violence, the Mahatma betrayed a total ignorance of the springs of human action.In more recent history, it was the heroic fight put up by Chhatrapati Shivaji that first checked and eventually destroyed the Muslim tyranny in India . It was absolutely essentially for Shivaji to overpower and kill an aggressive Afzal Khan, failing which he would have lost his own life. In condemning history\u2019s towering warriors like Shivaji, Rana Pratap and Guru Gobind Singh as misguided patriots, Gandhiji has merely exposed his self-conceit. He was, paradoxical as it may appear, a violent pacifist who brought untold calamities on the country in the name of truth and non-violence, while Rana Pratap, Shivaji and the Guru will remain enshrined in the hearts of their countrymen for ever for the freedom they brought to them. The accumulating provocation of thirty-two years, culminating in his last pro-Muslim fast, at last goaded me to the conclusion that the existence of Gandhi should be brought to an end immediately. Gandhi had done very good in South Africa to uphold the rights and well-being of the Indian community there. But when he finally returned to India he developed a subjective mentality under which he alone was to be the final judge of what was right or wrong. If the country wanted his leadership, it had to accept his infallibility; if it did not, he would stand aloof from the Congress and carry on his own way. Against such an attitude there can be no halfway house. Either Congress had to surrender its will to his and had to be content with playing second fiddle to all his eccentricity, whimsicality, metaphysics and primitive vision, or it had to carry on without him. He alone was the Judge of everyone and every thing; he was the master brain guiding the civil disobedience movement; no other could know the technique of that movement. He alone knew when to begin and when to withdraw it. The movement might succeed or fail, it might bring untold disaster and political reverses but that could make no difference to the Mahatma\u2019s infallibility. \u2018A Satyagrahi can never fail\u2019 was his formula for declaring his own infallibility and nobody except himself knew what a Satyagrahi is. Thus, the Mahatma became the judge and jury in his own cause. These childish insanities and obstinacies, coupled with a most severe austerity of life, ceaseless work and lofty character made Gandhi formidable and irresistible. Many people thought that his politics were irrational but they had either to withdraw from the Congress or place their intelligence at his feet to do with as he liked. In a position of such absolute irresponsibility Gandhi was guilty of blunder after blunder, failure after failure, disaster after disaster. Gandhi\u2019s pro-Muslim policy is blatantly in his perverse attitude on the question of the national language of India . It is quite obvious that Hindi has the most prior claim to be accepted as the premier language. In the beginning of his career in India , Gandhi gave a great impetus to Hindi but as he found that the Muslims did not like it, he became a champion of what is called Hindustani.. Everybody in India knows that there is no language called Hindustani; it has no grammar; it has no vocabulary. It is a mere dialect, it is spoken, but not written. It is a bastard tongue and cross-breed between Hindi and Urdu, and not even the Mahatma\u2019s sophistry could make it popular. But in his desire to please the Muslims he insisted that Hindustani alone should be the national language of India . His blind followers, of course, supported him and the so-called hybrid language began to be used. The charm and purity of the Hindi language was to be prostituted to please the Muslims. All his experiments were at the expense of the Hindus. From August 1946 onwards the private armies of the Muslim League began a massacre of the Hindus. The then Viceroy, Lord Wavell, though distressed at what was happening, would not use his powers under the Government of India Act of 1935 to prevent the rape, murder and arson. The Hindu blood began to flow from Bengal to Karachi with some retaliation by the Hindus. The Interim Government formed in September was sabotaged by its Muslim League members right from its inception, but the more they became disloyal and treasonable to the government of which they were a part, the greater was Gandhi\u2019s infatuation for them. Lord Wavell had to resign as he could not bring about a settlement and he was succeeded by Lord Mountbatten. King Log was followed by King Stork. The Congress which had boasted of its nationalism and socialism secretly accepted Pakistan literally at the point of the bayonet and abjectly surrendered to Jinnah. India was vivisected and one-third of the Indian territory became foreign land to us from August 15, 1947. Lord Mountbatten came to be described in Congress circles as the greatest Viceroy and Governor-General this country ever had. The official date for handing over power was fixed for June 30, 1948, but Mountbatten with his ruthless surgery gave us a gift of vivisected India ten months in advance. This is what Gandhi had achieved after thirty years of undisputed dictatorship and this is what Congress party calls \u2018freedom\u2019 and \u2018peaceful transfer of power\u2019. The Hindu-Muslim unity bubble was finally burst and a theocratic state was established with the consent of Nehru and his crowd and they have called \u2018freedom won by them with sacrifice\u2019 \u2013 whose sacrifice? When top leaders of Congress, with the consent of Gandhi, divided and tore the country \u2013 which we consider a deity of worship \u2013 my mind was filled with direful anger. One of the conditions imposed by Gandhi for his breaking of the fast unto death related to the mosques in Delhi occupied by the Hindu refugees. But when Hindus in Pakistan were subjected to violent attacks he did not so much as utter a single word to protest and censure the Pakistan Government or the Muslims concerned. Gandhi was shrewd enough to know that while undertaking a fast unto death, had he imposed for its break some condition on the Muslims in Pakistan , there would have been found hardly any Muslims who could have shown some grief if the fast had ended in his death. It was for this reason that he purposely avoided imposing any condition on the Muslims. He was fully aware of from the experience that Jinnah was not at all perturbed or influenced by his fast and the Muslim League hardly attached any value to the inner voice of Gandhi. Gandhi is being referred to as the Father of the Nation. But if that is so, he had failed his paternal duty inasmuch as he has acted very treacherously to the nation by his consenting to the partitioning of it. I stoutly maintain that Gandhi has failed in his duty. He has proved to be the Father of Pakistan. His inner-voice, his spiritual power and his doctrine of non-violence of which so much is made of, all crumbled before Jinnah\u2019s iron will and proved to be powerless. Briefly speaking, I thought to myself and foresaw I shall be totally ruined, and the only thing I could expect from the people would be nothing but hatred and that I shall have lost all my honour, even more valuable than my life, if I were to kill Gandhiji. But at the same time I felt that the Indian politics in the absence of Gandhiji would surely be proved practical, able to retaliate, and would be powerful with armed forces. No doubt, my own future would be totally ruined, but the nation would be saved from the inroads of Pakistan . People may even call me and dub me as devoid of any sense or foolish, but the nation would be free to follow the course founded on the reason which I consider to be necessary for sound nation-building. After having fully considered the question, I took the final decision in the matter, but I did not speak about it to anyone whatsoever. I took courage in both my hands and I did fire the shots at Gandhiji on 30th January 1948, on the prayer-grounds of Birla House. I do say that my shots were fired at the person whose policy and action had brought rack and ruin and destruction to millions of Hindus. There was no legal machinery by which such an offender could be brought to book and for this reason I fired those fatal shots. I bear no ill will towards anyone individually but I do say that I had no respect for the present government owing to their policy which was unfairly favourable towards the Muslims. But at the same time I could clearly see that the policy was entirely due to the presence of Gandhi. I have to say with great regret that Prime Minister Nehru quite forgets that his preachings and deeds are at times at variances with each other when he talks about India as a secular state in season and out of season, because it is significant to note that Nehru has played a leading role in the establishment of the theocratic state of Pakistan, and his job was made easier by Gandhi\u2019s persistent policy of appeasement towards the Muslims. I now stand before the court to accept the full share of my responsibility for what I have done and the judge would, of course, pass against me such orders of sentence as may be considered proper. But I would like to add that I do not desire any mercy to be shown to me, nor do I wish that anyone else should beg for mercy on my behalf. My confidence about the moral side of my action has not been shaken even by the criticism levelled against it on all sides. I have no doubt that honest writers of history will weigh my act and find the true value thereof some day in future. ",
