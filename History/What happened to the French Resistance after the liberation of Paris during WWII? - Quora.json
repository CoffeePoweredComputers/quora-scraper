            "answer_text": "It grew exponentially! There were a lot of last-minute sign-ups to the resistance, and a lot of scandals regarding people who pretended to be resistants after the war. More seriously, I imagine your question might be: were they turned into a military force to fight alongside the allies?  The answer would be no. Although it might just be a care of being exhausted, the US soldier\u2019s wary look at the Franc-tireurs is rather justified: although a point of pride for us, these guys were reckless, underfed, poorly organized and badly equipped. At the battle of the Vercors plateau, the resistants tired to launch an assault on German troops, and they were utterly crushed. Maquis du Vercors - Wikipedia What they did manage to do after the liberation of Paris was: Considerably reduce the number of men needed to take over the South-West of France. Rising in numbers, they destroyed logistics and communication in the area. This meant that with a much smaller amount of allied troops, the german garrisons there could be wiped out.Take over civil administration of France. They formed tribunals and local adminsitrative councils. While some of them got trigger-happy and started executing people left and right and punishing women who were through to have collaborated, what they managed to do was keep the country quiet enough for allied troops not to be hampered by hungry/rioting/fleeing civilians.Allow France to rapidly get back on its feet with minimal civil confusion and provide a modicum of support to the Allied advance into Germany, through de Lattre de Tassigny\u2019s forces (defending the extreme right flank at Strasbourg during the Battle of the Bulge).",

Others joined the resurrected French army, swelling the ranks of the Free French from 400,000 in June 1944 to 1.1 million by May 1945 making them the forth largest allied army in Europe. The French chased the fleeing Vichy into Germany and captured the \u201cmountain fortress\u201d in Bavaria that had been suggested that Hitler flee to rather than stay in Berlin. Many were rejected for formal military service as \u201cunfit\" often suffering from malnourishment during the final months of occupation. ",
