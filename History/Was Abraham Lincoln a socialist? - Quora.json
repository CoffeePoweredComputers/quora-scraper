            "answer_text": "Yes.  Lincoln was a staunch labor supporter and shared Karl Marx\u2019s idea that labor was superior to capital and valued workers rights over the interests of the corporate elite. An idea which modern day left-leaning groups like the Democratic Socialists of America also support. Lincoln was even a pen pal of Karl Marx and Marx wrote to a letter to Lincoln in 1865 congratulating Lincoln on emancipating slaves at the end of the Civil War. He believed in his own words that \u201cthings ought to belong to those whose labor has produced them\u201d meaning he believed workers should control the wealth they create and the means of production of it (the very definition of socialism). In Lincoln\u2019s very first State of the Union address in 1861 this is what he said about capitalism\u2019s relation to labor: \u201cNow, there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed, nor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer. Both these assumptions are false, and all inferences from them are groundless. Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights.\u201d Lincoln believed in protecting the American worker from capitalistic exploitation and ensuring that wealth was distributed evenly throughout the country. Lincoln was one of the first Democratic Socialists in American history. See Link:Lincoln and the socialist roots of the Republican Party ",

            "answer_text": "No, and the divisions back then don\u2019t so clearly match that labor-vs-capital/owners divide that was dominant a couple generations later. The Republican Party found itself representing both labor and capital (the North\u2019s interests), so in a way representing capitalism, against agrarian or feudal interests (especially large but somewhat also small farmers). Tariffs would have helped both owners and workers in Northern factories. The parties have seen massive shifts; it\u2019s hard to compare what they stand for across a couple generations. When the Progressive Era came after the Civil War (more about improving capitalism than overthrowing it, but reasonable to say it was in the direction of socialism, with the government using it\u2019s power to influence who could own what capital \u2014 to switch from Robber Barrons\u2019 monopolies to somewhat competitive, somewhat regulated capital ownership), it arose in both parties. The left-right schism was inside, rather than between, the dominant parties. It\u2019s only a bit before the time of FDR that the Democrats being for working people and Republicans for capital really solidified. We may be entering a new era now, hard to tell, in some ways going back to the Civil War dynamics: innovative businesses like Silicon Valley and tech on one side; agrarian, resource extraction, rent-collecting and uncompetitive businesses seeking rescue by an interventionist deal-making government on the other. We also live in a post-capitalist world in way thanks to financialization, where vast amounts of the profits are going to Wall Street rather than what Marx and Adam Smith would have agreed to call productive capital (like factories) \u2014 unions and factory managers have both been leapfrogged with one jump. Past wealth is being mined, rather than new wealth created, in a growing portion of our economy: will the parties reconfigure around this? ",
