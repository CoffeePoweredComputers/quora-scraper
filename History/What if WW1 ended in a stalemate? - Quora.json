            "answer_text": "If the USA had stayed out, it is possible that 1917 would have played out with fewer offensives, with Britain and France desperately trying to prop up Russia and keep it fighting, if only defensively, Germany trying to prop up Austria-Hungary and Turkey, and Britain trying to prop up Italy and France. It was becoming a race to the bottom, who would fall first, would fall next. In 1917 Germany was in a stronger position militarily compared to the Allies, but could not exploit it except in the east. Its biggest problem was the naval blockade. Had the French army mutinies got worse, France would have been compelled to stay on the defensive. No doubt there were people on each side who looked at what looked like deadlock and wondered if the only way out was to make a peace settlement, even a bad one. The entry of the USA into the war meant that the Allies could could on new serves and resources to bring the fight to an end. So, what if the USA stays out? The end of 1917 brought two disasters for the Allies; Caporetto, and Russia dropping out of the war. And would the UK have fought Third Ypres if the USA was not coming in? But would that have been enough for the Allies to begin negotiations? Early 1918 saw the German Michael offensive, which was initially successful but failed to \u201cthrow the British into the sea\u201d. And this was before the Americans had turned up in Europe in any significant numbers. If we look at 1918 without the USA, it becomes matter of conjecture. Would the British and French have attempted a major offensive before the German troops arrived from the eastern front? Like Michael, a matter of desperation before things got worse. 1918 again plays out as struggle between the naval blockade and the situation on the ground. What could Germany have done to force a better situation in 1918? Most likely, expand submarine warfare, and send the surface fleet out to break the blockade. The German surface fleet was a threat even when in harbor, but historically it achieved very little. On the ground; repeat the success of Caporetto against Italy and try to force it out of the war. If the fighting was restricted to western front, and Germany could obtain food from, say, Russia, it could then fight a mainly defensive war and try to negotiate a settlement. But only as long as Austria-Hungary held together. And therein lies the problem. What would have been acceptable to the warring parties? Except for Britain, all of them wanted territorial gains as compensation for their losses. Possibly, after a long time, they might have agreed to return to the prewar frontiers. But it would almost certainly have been but a pause in the fighting, to be resumed a generation later. As happened historically. ",

            "answer_text": "Not quite true Jason: At the start of the war none of the politicians had any war aims. Nobody quite knew what they were fighting for. The general census was that it was a war of defense which is what the governing politicians sold to their publics. However by the end of 1915, the various politician had formed their war aims - what they (each country) wanted out of the war assuming they won, for example Germany wanted the the port of Antwerp along with a corridor across Belgium linking it to Germany, western half of Lorraine and a number of colonies \u201cowned\u201d by the Allies. By November 1918 the Germany nation - the home front had collapsed into civil war and the Imperial Army or what was left of it was in full retreat - was beaten; make no mistake about that. Even if they had not asked for an armistice then the war would have continued after a break for the winter with the full force of the new American Armies in 1919, which would have led to a full surrender. So there was no way that there would have been a stalemate. The flu pandemic killed a lot of people, but there was still enough Allied soldiers left in 1919 to continued the war and defeat Germany, if they had not realised that they had been defeat in the autumn of 1918. What is true to say is that the peace conference was muddled by the Allies and the peace that was created allowed the political situation in Germany to form the Nazis, the rearmament and the Second World War. In the words of Marshal Foch \u201cThis is not the end of the war, it\u2019s an armistice for 20 years.\u201d He said that in June 1919 after the signing of the Peace Treaty with Germany. WW2 stated in September 1939! ",
