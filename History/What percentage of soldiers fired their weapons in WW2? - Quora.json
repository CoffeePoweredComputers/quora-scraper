            "answer_text": "I know for a fact in the American Army that just about all of them had to qualify, so I would suppose that nearly all of the soldiers who were taken into the military had to fire some sort of gun at some point. As to combat, I understand the figures are approximately 20 to 1 , that is, that for every soldier that you get into combat, there is that many support people behind that single soldier. Most soldiers in combat would at some point or other have had to fire their gun, or work whatever team weapon they were assigned to ( tank,mortar, howitzer, medium or heavy machine gun, Naval gun, Etc), so all soldiers in combat have to do something concrete-- to, at the very least, keep from being defeated if not actually triumph. So, just about every World War II gun that had been issued has been fired by the soldier was issued to. As for those that were carried into combat, most of them were fired in the general direction of somebody who did not like them. Bear in mind that a great many weapons were still in quartermaster stocks at the end of World War II, so there's a fair number of these guns that were eventually sent elsewhere in mint condition-- that is, unfired.
