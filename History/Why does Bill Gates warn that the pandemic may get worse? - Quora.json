            "answer_text": "Well Pravash- our trusted media has reassured us the conspiracy theories are absolutely untrue. His charitable organization has invested millions into big pharma, created a virus to create a supposed desperate need for a vaccine because you have a nano microchip you want every human on the planet to be mandated by law to receive- not because anyone really needs this vaccine\u2026..perhaps it\u2019s more about population control, global domination and overthrowing existing governments replacing them with agenda 21\u2026..Same as 2030 agenda\u2026where communism will have more freedoms than the agenda that is being pushed\u2026\u2026\u2026..perhaps event2\ud83c\udf0e1 was the initiator to get this global game going? To say good ole Billy G and his ever so generous Gates foundation could be so sinister is just sheer conspiracy. How could anyone believe it?!? Follow the money. Look at all the Nonprofit organizations associated with Gates or his friends- like Fauci. Fauci is another great guy concerned about our well being and is the head of NIAID, Partners In Health- WHO, Global Prepardeness Monitoring Board, Clinton Foundation, The Global Fund to fight aids, PEPFAR, CEPI, Moderna Inc, GAVI\u2026..connect the dots and see whose names, or whose spouses are interconnected in this web. Good luck. Don\u2019t forget to wear a mask so you don\u2019t get Covid\u2026..better off depriving your body of a little oxygen to be safe. ",

            "answer_text": "It's simple. Trump has bungled the pandemic from the very beginning. His attempts to deny and wish away the carona virus have resulted in the deaths of thousands of United States\u2019 citizens and many more worldwide, when you count the number who have died as a result of Trump's dismantling the pandemic response preparations left for him by the Bush and Obama administrations. If not for his hatred of all things Obama, the world and we could have prevented the outbreak from becoming a pandemic, like was done with the Ebola outbreak. With Trump's continued efforts at hiding the truth about the carona virus and holding rallies, where few wear masks. He is acting as a vector and a super spreader. The number of cases is going up, again as a result of the premature reopening of country, people discontinuing precautions, and the riots. His and Pence's examples of not wearing a mask has encouraged his followers to not wear masks. In fact, not wearing a mask has become a political statement. Politicizing a disease is a a huge mistake and can only increase the number of carona virus cases. Bill Gates is an intelligent man, and he can see the writing on the wall. His opinion is based on sound observations, and I believe that he is correct in his assessment. ",
