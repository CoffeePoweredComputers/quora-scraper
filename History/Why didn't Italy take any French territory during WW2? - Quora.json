            "answer_text": "Q: Why didn't Italy take any French territory during WW2? Italy declared war on Britain and France 10 June 1940 after the British evacuated their troops from the continent through the port town of Dunkirk. France is now [mostly] fighting alone though some British units weren\u2019t in the Dunkirk area. It\u2019s clear that France is not going to win. France began evacuating towns along the Franco-Italian border before the Italian declaration of war. French engineers destroyed transportation and communications links across the border. Any Italians in the region who were known or suspected of anti-French sentiments were arrested. All other Italians on the French side of the border were ordered to register by 15 June. All of this before Italy and France were at war. Most even signed an oath of loyalty. Everyone knows about the famous Maginot Line but the French didn\u2019t ignore the Italian border. Fortifications were built in the south called the Alpine Line and sometimes called the Little Maginot Line. The land between Italy and France is mountainous with several passes that allow access from one nation to the other. It\u2019s a natural barrier. The French also constructed several artillery and infantry support bunkers around the passes.  [source (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alpine_Line_10_June_1940.svg)] The land was less rugged along the coast - or \u2018maritime\u2019 region - additional artillery and infantry forts were build. The 56 kilometers (35 miles) of this region offered an easier route than the mountain passes, which could be defended with fewer men and guns. Italy had also built forts along their side of the border so it wasn\u2019t just a one-sided effort. In general, however, both Italy and France prepared defensive positions and strategy rather than offensive ones. The Italians had 18 infantry divisions and 4 alpine divisions (300,000 men). They did not, however, have any offensive plans defined so any offensive would be more inspiration than prepared. The first attacks came by air, against [British] Malta, rather than France. British planes arrived in southern France to attack Turin and Genoa. The Italians mistook the British for their own and lit up one landing strip. The damage was light and none of the industrial targets were damaged. There were some skirmishes in the mountains by 12 June, 2 days after the declaration of war. They were not, however, any big battles. Remember, both sides were deployed for defense rather than offense. The French government fell on 15 June and General P\u00e9tain took over. Mussolini knew P\u00e9tain would come to an \u2018understanding\u2019 with the Germans so he felt it was important that they take some land before an armistice could be signed. He ordered the army to attack in 3 days, which is not really enough time for defensive plans to become offensive plans. It didn\u2019t matter, though, since they needed move. On 17 June, 1 day before the Italian Army was to attack France, P\u00e9tain announced, \u201cIt is with a heavy heart that I tell you today that we must stop fighting.\u201d It wasn\u2019t surrender but it indicated the Italians needed to move soon before it was too late. It also suggested that the French forces in the south were weaker than previously thought, maybe even on the bring of collapsing without any significant fighting in their region. Then the Italians did attack, the French forces were still in their defensive positions ready to um defend the border. Italian forces crossed the border into France on 21 June. They had some success early on and the defenders were weakened because some men had been pulled for actions in the north against the Germans.  [source above] In the end, Italy didn\u2019t take significant land in France because Italy waited until it was clear the German invasion in the north had a chance at success (maybe even that it had already succeeded).Italian forces were deployed for defense with no orders or even plans drawn up to attach French positions, resulting in a less than idea invasion.Conflicting orders were sent to the Italian Army facing France that didn\u2019t help the situation.Time. Time just ran out before they could get many gains.The Franco-Italian Armistice, therefore, was generous to Italy since they were allied with Germany and Germany was really dictating the terms. France had not been defeated by Italy, only Germany. A German officer later mentioned that the mountainous region would have stopped the Blitzkrieg tactics that worked so well on the plains of northern France. The region was called \u201cthe most unsuitable of all conceivable theaters of operations.\u201d ",

Now it may be true that they never got around to juridically incorporating any of it into Italy which had been a long-term aim of Mussolini.That may be because Hitler put a damper on it, he was more interested in keeping P\u00e9tain\u2019s government onside and collaborative; likewise he didn't give a handout of parts of Algeria and Tunisia to Mussolini who thought they should go to him, but was powerless to make happen.
