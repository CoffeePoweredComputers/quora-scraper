            "answer_text": "The original Czechoslovak intention was to restore pre-war borders and it was never questioned by USSR. On 8 May 1944, USSR and Czechoslovakia signed a treaty concerning the relationship between the Czechoslovak administration and the Supreme Command of the Red Army. According to this treaty, all power had to be in the hands of Czechoslovak authorities immediately after the end of military operations. In October 1944, the Red Army started liberation of Subcarpathian Ruthenia. The Czechoslovak government-in-exile sent there a delegation to administer the region (per the treaty). However, there was a latent conflict between pro-Czechoslovak and pro-Soviet movement supported by Soviet bodies. On 26 November 1944, a committee, led by a Soviet agent Ivan Turyanitsa proclaimed the will of people to join the Soviet Ukraine. USSR declared that it would not act against the will of people. Czechoslovak Communists quickly agreed and the rest accepted a new situation. Czechoslovakia and USSR signed a treaty about Subcarpathian Ruthenia, resp. Carpathian Ukraine on 29 June 1945. ",
