            "answer_text": "The M\u00fcnster Rebellion. If you think history to be boring, then you have never read about the M\u00fcnster Rebellion. I am personally very interested as the rebels of M\u00fcnster because their leaders were a part of the Protestant Reformation group known as the Anabaptists with whom I have a degree of self-identification. Not that I would identify with the circus that took place in M\u00fcnster during 1534\u20131535 AD. Whatever you want to find in historic drama, you can find it in this story: the psychology of religious mass-hysteria, psychotic clergy, murder, feudal battles, torture, communal living and even a smattering of pious free-sex. It is a soap-operatic script. The rebellion was ordinary enough in terms of the explicit religious doctrines in dispute. As the Anabaptist label itself suggests, the primary reformation that the sect supported was elimination of infant baptism. The belief that only adults who could make a conscious choice were capable of making an adequate confession of faith in Jesus Christ seems ordinary today, but it was incendiary enough at the time to result in their persecution by both Catholics and Protestants. As crazy as the rebellion seems, it must be acknowledge that the repression of the Anabaptists leading up to the events was as bad as you might expect the treatment of heretics in feudal times to be. The rebellion was eventually put down, of course, or it would be called the M\u00fcnster Revolution rather than Rebellion. The leaders who had survived, John of Leiden, Bernhard Knipperdolling, and Bernhard Krechting, were tortured in the public square and their remains placed in cages on the church steeple where they remained for decades. Eventually their skeletal remains were removed, but the cages remain there to this day.  If you want to hear a great summary of what happened in M\u00fcnster, I highly recommend Dan Carlin\u2019s excellent Hardcore History episode entitled Prophets of Doom. You will be hooked too. ",

            "answer_text": "For me the nineteenth century that built the foundation of the United States of America is the most exciting time, before the industry barons such as Carnegie and Rockefeller took their toll upon the American psyche.  This time, in my view, is the good and just birth of a great nation.  And as a radical Englishman I consider it my natural heritage.  It is the post-Enlightenment time during which an attempt was made to apply the many great ideas that had been born in Europe and to take the effort further. I am especially interested in, and impressed by, the recovery of Salem that defeated the irrational church with reason and good sense, becoming a center for original and rational science. In particular, advocated and propagated in the foundation of Harvard as a University by the families of Nathaniel Bowditch and Benjamin Peirce.   Benjamin senior was the first real librarian and biographer of Harvard College. Benjamin Peirce, his son and head of the mathematics department and astronomer, is of special note, as are his sons James and Charles through the century.  Admirers of the Greek intellectual era, James for example lived his life on Harvard Square and was reportedly Gay, they sought to reconceive the notion of God in scientific terms.  In 1855, Benjamin Peirce wrote A System of Analytic Mechanics that was taught and widely admired at Harvard in which he argued that all motion is the algebraic sum of all the forces of nature. Essentially arguing what Einstein would later call in more exact terms \"General Covariance.\" Since in our own experience we encounter force in will he argued that it follows by necessity that the source of all natures forces is spiritual.  His use of this term should be understood in the context of the time and his audience, mathematical students at Harvard that had been raised in a predominantly Christian society. He ends the book with the capitalized phrase; THERE IS ONE GOD, AND SCIENCE IS THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIM. Years later, in 1908, Charles wrote a paper entitled The Neglected Argument for the Reality of God, for which many accused him of atheism - yet his neglected argument is that of his father.  The family put science first and were concerned with matters of existence at the same time as August Comte argued for Positivism, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche argued for Existentialism, but instead of throwing out the notion of God they sought to reconcieve God in terms of scientific discovery. For them God is precisely whatever science tells us about the fundamental nature of the world, the source of all that is, the birth of all creation.  As a result America was able to avoid the Existential void and crisis of the death of God that European thinkers faced. These ideas arrived on American shores through the exodus from Europe for religious freedom and the movement of Unitarianism that brought with it the work and ideas of Rene Descartes and Nicholas Malebranche. Toward the end of his life, Benjamin wrote Ideality in the physical sciences an account of the cosmology of the time that includes consideration of ideas and how they came to be in the world. At the time is was believed that all the world is tractable to science and mathematics, including biophysics, sense and response. In 1870 Benjamin Peirce wrote: In every form of material manifestation, there is a corresponding form of human thought, so that the human mind is as wide in its range of thought as the physical universe in which it thinks. With others, Benjamin and James Peirce led Harvard University into the twentieth century. Sadly this story was oppressed during the early twentieth century, I suspect because of homophobia and the simplification by European influences. For example, Hilbert's Vector spaces versus Hamilton's Quaternions, the \"Russelization\" of Logic in Logicism, that so upset Charles and Christine Ladd-Franklin, his student, the resulting dualism of two valued logic, the intellectual division of the physical and psychologism, and the rise of epistemic materialism, from which all epistemology is founded upon an unfeeling material basis. Charles Peirce has been glorified in recent times as America's greatest philosopher but, unjustly, in isolation. In fact many of the original ideas attributed to Charles are rooted in the work of his father. Indeed, in many ways Charles did not succeed in the mission his father had set him upon - building the bridge between pure mathematics and the physical sciences. Benjamin Peirce stands, arms folded, in the 1863 portrait of the establishment of the American Academy of Science, along with Abraham Lincoln, Louis Agassiz,  Alexander Dallas Bache, and Joseph Henry. The Harvard contingent made up the Scientific Lazzaroni. I could go on, there are many other interesting characters to mention, but I think this is sufficient to answer this question.
