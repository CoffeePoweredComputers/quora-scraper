            "answer_text": "Well, that\u2019s not entirely accurate. There is more evidence for the historicity of Julius Caesar, but when it comes to biographical details, there are more primary sources for the life of Jesus, those sources are much closer to the events they record, the text itself is far more reliable, the manuscripts are older, and there are substantially more manuscripts available. For example, Jesus is mentioned in at least eight sources within 90 years of the crucifixion, and at least five of those sources contain original material. That number might be higher; it is impossible to date the letters attributed to James, Jude, and Peter in the New Testament, and scholars are still debating whether several references in the Talmud are referring to Jesus of Nazareth. Even if we assume that the material in these later epistles was written in the early second century, that still dates them to within 100 years of the crucifixion. The earliest historical mention of Jesus is found in the letters of Paul, the earliest of which was written within 20 years of the crucifixion. His letters also include liturgical formulae, with historical information, that were composed at least a decade earlier. At least five of the historical references to Jesus, including the three biographies in the Synoptic gospels, were written within living memory of Jesus, well within the life span of adult eye-witnesses, and within communities in the Levant where living eye-witnesses were active. In the case of Julius Caesar, we have roughly as many historical references to Caesar as we do to Jesus, but when it comes to biographical details, there are only four primary sources outside of the works attributed directly to Caesar himself: Appian, Cassius Dio, Suetonius, and Plutarch. The earliest of these sources is Plutarch, who penned his biography of Caesar roughly 175 years after Caesar\u2019s death. None of these sources was written within living memory of either Julius Caesar or those who knew him. If we place any historical value on the information in Suetonius, we also have to consider that Suetonius also mentions Jesus of Nazareth, and that the life of Jesus was much closer to Suetonius\u2019 own time than was the life of Julius Caesar. For those who dismiss the gospels due to their miraculous content, it\u2019s worth noting that the primary sources on the life of Julius Caesar are also riddled with miraculous events, including a full-fledged virgin birth (of Romulus, in Plutarch\u2019s Lives). For those who dismiss the gospels due to contradictory material, it\u2019s worth noting that the primary sources on the life of Julius Caesar are similarly contradictory, not only among themselves, but also with respect to Caesar\u2019s own writings. For those who dismiss the gospels because their were written by worshippers of Jesus, it\u2019s worth noting that Julius Caesar was also worshiped as a god by his biographers, and that all of Caesar\u2019s biographers held a favorable view of him. Now, I\u2019m not saying that the material in the gospels is more reliable than the information that we have on Julius Caesar. However, there are a number of people running around the internet these days claiming that Jesus never existed, that nothing can be known of his life, or that the Jesus described in the gospels is a fabrication based on some guy who might have existed and might have been named \u201cJesus.\u201d Unless these folks are willing to apply the same criteria to the life of Julius Caesar, we can safely dismiss their opinions as a bad case of special pleading.

            "answer_text": "Why do people say there\u2019s more historical evidence that Jesus existed, outside of the Bible, than there is for the existence of Julius Caesar? A~~~I like to play the what-if-it\u2019s-true game. Let\u2019s pretend for a minute it is true there\u2019s more historical evidence that Jesus existed outside of the Bible\u2014than there is for the existence of Julius Caesar\u2026 I don\u2019t think there is\u2014but let\u2019s play\u2026 If it\u2019s true\u2014we can conclude with a certain level of reasonability that both Jesus and Julius existed in real places in real time in history. 100% reasonable. What we can\u2019t confirm\u2014and this is kinda the important part\u2014is that this existent Jesus had magical powers. That this Jesus walked on water, turned water into wine\u2014and then walked on the wine. We can\u2019t confirm that Jesus was a master ice skater or skilled in the ways of the Jedi. Maybe Julius had a dream of being a dancer and not a leader. Those are all unconfirmed rumors. What happens FAR\u2014FAR\u2014too often is confused people take one part of a (supposedly confirmed) rumor\u2014and assume the other parts of the rumor\u2014or related rumors\u2014 are then confirmed to be true by default. This is a serious mistake in logic. This is no more evident than if we encounter a vampire in our kitchen\u2014and then assume that a garland of garlic and some sun shining through the window will drive it away. All because we saw a few vampire movies? So--if a guy named Jesus existed for realsies\u2014it don\u2019t make him magic\u2014or the legends of his adventures real or true. And that missing part\u2014is the most important part\u2014to those who make the claim that he existed.  ",
