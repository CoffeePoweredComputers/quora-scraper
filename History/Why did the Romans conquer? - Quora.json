            "answer_text": "You mean, why did the Romans conquer? Actually, one of the most amazing thing about the ancient Romans is this: They claimed never to have fought any war except defensively. How do you reconcile that with their rate of expansion? Well, they were much like the United States, 2,000 years later, claiming to only fight defensive war. In the case of the USA, the supreme example of this is the Mexican American War. President James Polk didn\u2019t want to be seen as waging a war of naked aggression, so he waited for a small dispute over the border with Texas to explode, secretly praying, \u201cPlease please please give us some pretext to go to war, so we can fight with you and then claim half your territory as a penalty!\u201d US historians have never been proud of that episode in our history, but it explains why the US has California. The Roman Republic and Empire operated in a similar way. They would claim to be the offended party, but once they went to war, and they won, they usually ended up controlling your country. Another tactic they had was to be invited to come into a country, to help settle a dynastic war. But once they arrived, they never left. This is how Egypt and Judah came to be dominated. So the Romans had many ways to conquer you without calling it conquest. But as to the other question: why did they do it\u2026.? The answer is a simple and very, very old one. It has been called \u201cthe Yoke of Asher,\u201d \u201cthe Mandate of Heaven,\u201d \u201cthe White Man\u2019s Burden\u201d and \u201cManifest Destiny.\u201d The idea of manifest destiny \u2014 in whatever form \u2014 is that a country that wins a lot of battles or wars decides that it must be favored by the gods or by God; the proof lies in all the wars it wins; it therefore concludes that God must favor the country because the people of this country are more virtuous than others, and therefore it is RIGHT that they should rule. Romans decided that they were more virtuous in the eyes of Jove (Jupiter) and Mars, whom they also decided were the most powerful gods in the cosmos. The nature of this supposedly higher Roman virtue? To start with, they felt themselves culturally superior because they had adopted the best of Greek culture. But unlike the Greeks, they had superior administrative and organizational skills. They had slowly built a vast empire and had avoided petty wars between small states that went on for centuries. Latin (that is, Roman) phrases are still used\u2014to this day\u2014in the concepts of modern law. This shows you the tremendous respect Romans had through the ages for constructing a legal code. They were the great lawyers and jurists of ancient times. The Romans also believed that wherever they occupied territory, they made life much better of the local inhabitants. \u201cYou never had it so good before us\u201d is what they told the locals. Here are some of the specific improvements they made: Wherever they went, they made travel by water safer by chasing down pirates. Arrrggghhh!They build highways and then made them safer, by policing the roads. This was a huge boon to international commerce.They built aqueducts, bringing much-needed water to cities and townsThey brought the Pax Romana \u2014 peace to all the nations within its extent, so that most nations no longer had to go to warHistory has shown that the rise of nationalism would make people reject such an Empire today. But two thousand years ago, many people happily accepted its rule, despite having to pay taxes, because of the benefits I listed. For the Romans, the success of the Empire for a thousand years demonstrated the idea that Romans were intended by the gods to rule. ",

            "answer_text": "The Romans were always warlike. Their only prolonged period of peace was under their second king, Numa. The doors to the Temple of Janus were closed only during time of peace, and they were only closed once during the period between the reign of King Numa and the Principate of Augustus, a period of perhaps seven hundred years. At first, the Romans made war with neighboring peoples, the Latins, the Sabines, the Etruscans, and the Samnites. When they conquered their neighbors they formed confederations with them, granting them some form of \u201cLatin rights.\u201d in return for the right to levy auxiliary forces from these tribes. In the mid fourth century B.C. Rome was attacked and temporarily seized by the Gallic Senones under Brennus. There is a story that the Romans tried to buy the Senones off with gold. Brennus threw his sword on the scales to demand more gold. When the Romans objected he said \u201cvae victis\u201d-woe to the conquered. At that point the exiled dictator Marcus Furius Camillus arrived, saying \u201cNon auro, sed ferro, recuperando est patria.\u201d- The fatherland is not redeemed by gold but by iron. Camillus defeated the Senones and retook the city. Early in the third century B.C. Italy was invaded by Pyrrhus of Epirus. The Romans fought two battles which were technically victories for Pyrrhus, but they were so costly that he gave up the effort to conquer Italy. \u201cOne more such victory and we\u2019re ruined!\u201d he complained. This is where we get the term \u201cPyrrhic victory.\u201d The Romans did not venture outside of the Italian Peninsula until the First Carthaginian war, when they fought in Sicily and invaded Africa. Most of Sicily was ceded to the Romans in the Treaty of Lutatius which ended the First Punic War, and not long afterward the Romans also took possession of Sardinia and Corsica, an act that contributed to the causation of the Second Punic War. Sometime between the First and Second Punic Wars, the Romans also established a base in northern Spain. Southern Spain was ruled by the Carthaginians, and they made a treaty with Hasdrubal the Fair dividing their respective spheres of influence at the Ebro (Iberus) River. Shortly before the Second Punic War, the Romans invaded Illyria, whose queen, Tuetta, was encouraging pirates. They were also in the process of spreading Roman Rule northward, planting colonies such as Placentia and Cremona in areas previously inhabited by Gallic tribes. When Hannibal invaded Italy in 218 B.C. he took advantage of Gallic hostility to Rome and recruited many Galls to his standard. The Second Punic War left Rome in charge of all of Spain, and Carthage, although nominally independent, was under Roman domination. After the Second Punic War, Rome turned its attention to Greece, fighting wars with Philip V of Macedon and Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire. The historian Polybius writes of this period: \u201cFor who is so worthless or indolent as not to which to know by what means and under what system of polity the Romans in less than fifty-three years have succeeded in subjecting nearly the whole of the inhabited world to their sole government, a thing unique in history?\u201d The following century Caesar conquered Gall. The Emperor Claudius conquered Britain in the first century A.D. The empire reached its maximum under the Emperor Trajan, around the end of the first century A.D. with his conquest of Dacia (modern Romania.) Generally, the Romans ruled by co-opting the elites of the conquered peoples and Romanizing them. They could be benign rulers in some cases and ruthless in others. If there was prolonged resistance to their rule, they were ruthless as the fates of Numantia, Corinth, and Judea attest. The historian Tacitus quotes a Gallic chieftain as saying \u201cUbi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant,\u201d-they make a wasteland and call it peace. ",
