            "answer_text": "My initial response to the question as written is that it depends upon the country. However, I suspect that the question is whether the Parliamentary system or the American political structure produces a more powerful chief executive. The American system is designed for \u201cchecks and balances.\u201d The principle is that each of the branches (i.e. executive, judicial, and legislative) operates independently and prevent the other branches from taking too much control. Hence ideally, the President has his sphere of power without absolute power; that is what the framers of the Constitution intended. The President serves a 4 year term by indirect election by the people; removal from office requires an arcane process of impeachment. In its purest form, the Parliamentary system has final decisions in the hands of a legislative body. The Parliament chooses a Prime Minister, from among the members of the body, to be the chief executive. Said executive is subject to a \u201cno confidence\u201d vote at any time and may be removed. As written in the Constitution, the powers of the Presidency are very limited. Primarily, the President is commander of the armed forces, in charge of diplomatic affairs and negotiation of treaties, and various ministerial duties. However, over time the role has expanded. The greatest expansion was in the years following the 2nd World War; there was a need for a person to make quick decisions in the era of nuclear weapons. The power of the Presidency is still checked by the other branches if they exercise their powers which has not consistently taken place. In the time of George W. Bush, Congress failed to act to check his powers; despite Congress being controlled by the rival party for much of his tenure. In the time of Barack Obama, Congress took extreme steps to block the President\u2019s actions. As it stands, the current American system has a more powerful chief executive by virtue of the difficulty removing a chief executive. The Parliamentary system is able to remove its chief executive at the will of the legislative body. Otherwise, the powers of a Prime Minister and a President are close to equal. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends, of course. I\u2019ll start though by in general comparing the office of President and the office of Prime Minister, across all countries on a global scale. Generally speaking, a President of a country is its head of state and often its head of government as well. They are elected by the people or by an electoral college of some sort (which can include members of a legislature) to serve a set term and are not responsible to the legislature. In other words, a President is usually free to act according to his own policies without the fear of being removed by a motion of censure/no confidence by a legislature. They can however be removed through impeachment from a legislature, though this is normally used only when a President has committed a crime or violated their country\u2019s constitution. They also often hold the title of Commander-in-chief of the armed forces, though the actual weight of that title varies (i.e. it could be merely symbolic). Generally speaking, a Prime Minister is the head of government of their country and not the head of state. They are usually appointed to their post by the head of state (this is because the office historically evolved from whoever served as the chief adviser to the head of state) with the approval of the legislature and are then responsible to to the legislature, and generally can hold office as long as they command the legislature\u2019s approval. If the legislature disapproves of their policies, it can remove them with a motion of censure/no confidence. It is common for Prime Ministers to be members of the legislature and they may take their seat or address the legislature to advance their proposals. From these general differences, we can determine that Presidents usually have more independent executive power, as they can set their own policies without fear of reprisal as long as they follow the law. Prime Ministers, however, usually have more legislative power, because they need to command a legislative majority in order to remain in office and use that majority to pass legislation that supports their policies. The parliamentary system is constructed like that on purpose, so that the legislative agenda of a country works together with the executive agenda, allowing a government to function without stagnation. However, if the majority in the legislature is unstable, then a succession of no confidence motions can overturn Prime Ministers\u2019 governments, creating executive instability, while all the while there may be no real legislative accomplishments. A President would not have to worry about being dismissed by the legislature and is free to conduct their own executive actions, thus allowing the executive branch of a government to function in spite of legislative turmoil. However, if the President does not agree with the legislature on policy chances are their legislative agenda will never be achieved, creating other stagnation issues. But what happens when a country has both a President and a Prime Minister? Well it depends, so let\u2019s look at two examples. In Germany you have a President and a Chancellor (aka Prime Minister). The office of President was developed to fill the void left by the deposition of the monarchy at the conclusion of World War I, though its powers and responsibilities have changed between its inception with the institution of the Weimar Republic in 1919 and the establishment of the modern German republic in 1990. The President is elected by the Federal Convention (an electoral college) to a term of five years. They are responsible of the appointment of federal officials and judges, act as head of state, conclude treaties, accredit ambassadors, pardon federal offenders, and sign and promulgate laws. On occasion they can dissolve the Bundestag, the lower house of Parliament. Presidents have by tradition mostly kept their role ceremonial and non-partisan (even if they have a party affiliation) and act as a steward of the country. Presidents can refuse to sign legislation if they believe it violates the Constitution and thereby completely veto it, though this has only happened a few times in German history. The Chancellor is usually nominated by the President (though its not required) and are elected by the Bundestag and then formally appointed by the President (who is obliged to comply). They set government policy and exercise most executive powers. They also nominate other ministers for the President to appoint (the President is obliged to do so). As such, the Chancellor acts as the head of government. France has both a President and Prime Minister. The conventions surrounding the appointment of government officials and the handling of other affairs are about the same as in Germany. However, when the President is of the same party as the Prime Minister, they often take the superior role while the Prime Minister exercises their functions in the manner of a chief of staff to the President, who decides policy. They can refer acts of Parliament of to the Council of State (a body analogous to a constitutional court) or sent them back to Parliament for another reading (a weak veto). The President is the Commander-in-chief of the military and exercises great power over national security questions. They can also, with the consent of the Prime Minister and the cabinet, rule by decree in states of emergency. The Prime Minister \u2018s functions are similar to those in Germany, the main difference being that if they come from the President\u2019s party they usually defer to them. If the Prime Minister is of a different party, they often act with more independence and exercise the policy of the government as they see fit. As you can see, in the German model the Chancellor/Prime Minister holds more power than the President , but in the French model the President is usually superior. I hope this answered the question.
