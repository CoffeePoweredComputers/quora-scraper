            "answer_text": "An answer below cites the old story of milk \"accidentally\" curdling into cheese while stored in a container made from the fourth stomach of a ruminant animal.  Sometimes the story takes place at a domicile and other times while traveling.   I suspect, however, the more likely scenario is that when young ruminants were slaughtered it was noted that the milk in their abomasum wasn't liquid but curdled solids -- this would have predated actual dairy production by who knows how many thousands of years.  By this narrative, humans would have long if underdeveloped experience with the renneting technology of separating the milk solids from the liquids making storage of this valuable food source possible and therefore making the idea of creating and running dairy herds practical from the get-go.   Acid coagulation of the solids from the liquids will occur naturally as milk warms and the indigenous lactic acid bacteria convert lactose in lactic acid, a process that certainly was exploited to make fresh cheeses going way back.  But employing rennet results in a firmer and drier initial curd, allowing ultimately (after salting, pressing, etc, were figured out) for much longer storage without resorting to drying (sun, heat, smoke, etc) like the soft curds of acid cheeses have traditionally undergone to prolong shelf-life beyond fairly immediate consumption.   (One note concerning another answer below:  Rennet is an enzyme that acts on the casein proteins in acidified milk; rennet is not itself an acid.) ",

            "answer_text": "This is a question, the answer to which is probably lost in the mist of time. It is posited that somewhere in the Middle East, or possibly Central Asia, a herder stored some excess milk in the stomach of a calf and discovered that it had curdled. The curds tasted okay and what was more, they didn't spoil like milk kept in another kind of container. The earliest implement discovered that is indisputably associated with cheese making comes from Poland and dates back to ~5,500 years ago[1]. Using animal parts for storage -- stomachs, bladders, intestines, etc. -- is a prehistoric practice. The stomachs of calves, however, had some sort of \"magic\" ability that did good things to milk. That \"magic\" was later discovered to be rennet. There are cheeses made without animal rennet. Indian paneer, Mexican queso blanco, cottage cheese, French fromage blanc, are all examples of cheese made by curdling milk with acids rather than rennet. There are also \"vegetarian cheeses\" that use plant-derived rennet-like substances. The juice of thistle plants is one such substance. 1.  http://www.livescience.com/25472-first-cheesemakers-discovered.html ",

Milk stated to curdled in these dried stomach of cows/calves due to residual rennet in the stomach, and our fore father found that this coagulated milk tastes and keeps good, and hence our fore fathers further mastered this art of milk preservation, through cheese making, and as they say rest is history.
