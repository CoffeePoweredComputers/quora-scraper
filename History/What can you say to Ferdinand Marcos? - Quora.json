            "answer_text": "Not an awful lot, because the old man died 31 years ago. Had he still been alive, he would now be 103. I\u2019m not sure how lucid he would still be, so chances are even if he was alive, he would not be able to understand me at all. But lets assume for a minute, he was still alive. And lucid. Returned from the dead, for this conversation alone. Here\u2019s what I\u2019d tell him\u2026  I\u2019d tell him that his actions shaped his country forever. That he is a hero to some, but a villain to many more. That there are families who have lost people, who hate his guts and would want him dead, or on trial. That there are also hospitals, roads and highways named after him and people who worship his living relatives like Gods solely for being his descendants.  His wife, I would tell him, is still alive at the age of 91. She has come to define the very meaning of the word \u2018corruption\u2019, and people of all ages associate her first name, Imelda, with \u201coutlandishly large collection of shoes\u201d.  Finally\u2026 I would stop talking. I would not admonish him, for what would be the point? I am talking with a living, breathing piece of Philippine history here! For better, or for worse. I\u2019d ask him, if we can conduct an interview. If he would answer truthfully all the questions I might have. All the rumors, all the legends, I want to get to the bottom of it from the one source who knows. A source now forever silent. I would ask him about his military record during the war. I\u2019d ask him, if he is aware of what happened to general Yamashita\u2019s gold. Did he have anything to do with its disappearance, did he use the war loot to finance his early political career? What about that communist insurgency that he used as the reason for declaring martial law\u2026 how severe was it, and was it aided by China at the time? Oh and Aquino, who had him killed? Did Marcos have anything to do with it, was it his wife, the generals\u2026 Cory?  Oh I\u2019d have a lot of questions. And if he could answer them, no doubt it would be the most fascinating conversation of my life. I would want to know what went to his head, the moment he shot and killed a political rival of his father when he was just a teenager. How does it feel, to kill a man? Was he sure, he would get out of jail, when he was forced to mount his own defense? What about the Australian mistresses, the bastard children abroad? There\u2019s so, so much to unpack\u2026 From his early years until his last, Ferdinand Marcos was an iconic figure. Satan to some, to others the closest thing there was to a living God, and in the eyes of the world, one of the most successful conmen in human history. I have no doubt he was brilliant, and fascinating, and highly competent regardless of the outcome of what he did. And I would love, just to sit and listen to him. Record it all. Write it all done, every word, every nuance, every last comma, syllable, phrase and intonation. If I could talk to Ferdinand Marcos, I would ask him so many things. Enough to fill a book with. Write a novel. Make a film script for a biopic. Because it\u2019s one helluva story, and the most interesting human characters always have been not our heroes, but our anti-heroes and villains. ",
