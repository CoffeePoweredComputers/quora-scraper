            "answer_text": "The key point of spreading Islam, and also its domination, all over the countries, especially in the Middle East, was the Islamic slogans, which were: Peace, Equality and brotherhood. Islam in Syria Syria was an important land for Christians. Damascus is where St. Paul escaped from the Jews by being dropped through a window in a basket in the Via Recta. To this date, the villagers in Maaloula still speak Aramean, a language believed to be the spoken language of Jesus.  With the rapid spread of Islam, the then empires of Rome and Persia developed a serious concern for their sovereignty. Syria at the border of the Arabian Peninsula, was a centre for early Christianity. In the year 9 A.H. (after the Migration of the Prophet to Madina) the army of Byzantine launched the first war against Muslims and attacked the land of Arabia. Since then, there were several battles between the Muslims and the Byzantine armies until in the year 13 A.H. (636AD), In the beginning of the reign of Omar, the battle of Yarmouk on the Syrian-Jordan border- led to the defeat of Byzantine armies. Muslim armies seized Syria, then Jerusalem and fnally Damscus in 638 AD. Since then a rapid change in the religion of people of that region began. Since then Syria was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty (661-750 A.D). Although the Umayyad gave little efforts to require conversion to Islam, and there was no resentment directed towards Islam, the spread of Islam in Syria was like a field on fire.  Today 80% of the population of Syria are Muslims while Christian communities constitute approx. 8% of the Syrian population. Islam in Iran Until the third decade of the 7th century AD Iran was one of the two greatest empires of the world. When in 629 AD (7th AH) Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.w) sent a letter to Khosro Parviz, of Sassanian kings of Iran inviting him to embrace Islam, he could not possibly imagine that not merely his dynasty but the whole fabric of Iranian life will be engulfed and overwhelmed by Islam. Therefore, the king of Iran, contemptuously refused the invitation pouring scorn on the Arabs for eating lizards and the practice of infanticide thus tore up the letter. Although Abdullah; the ambassador of Islam explained that Arabs were even worse than what the king had described, but by the Grace of Allah and under the divine teachings of Prophet Muhammad, they enjoy a sublime monotheist culture.  The arrival of Islam in Iran was a turning point in Iranian history, in which the pattern of the country\u2019s religious and cultural development was determined up to the present age. The conquest of Islam brought to an end the last national Iranian dynasty for nearly a thousand years. About one thousand years before the arrival of Islam into Iran, Iran was conquered by Alexander the Great. Nevertheless, the influence of the Greek culture on Iran was rather shallow and temporary. The rise of Islam as a religion replacing Zoroastrianism is one of the greatest events in world history. Ever since, the history of Iran was divided into pre and post Islam. Early Stages of Conquest Prior to the demise of the Prophet of Islam, the Arabic speaking tribes of Iraq and Bahrain who were at the neighbourhood of Iran had already embrace Islam. After the demise of the Prophet, they refused to pay Zakat to the Islamic federal government in Madina. Abu-Bakr; the first Muslim Caliph ruled from 632-634, dispatched his commander Khalid Ibn Walid to that area. The Arabian tribes sought the help of their neighbouring Iranian local government.  The first battle between the Iranian local government and the army of Khalid Ibn Walid was called \u2018The Battle of the Chains \u0630\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0633\u0644 which took place in \u2018Kathemah ;\u06a9\u0627\u0638\u0645\u0629 between Bahrain and Basrah. During the battle, Hormoz the Commander of the Iranian army was killed by Khalid and his army was defeated. Subsequently, several confrontations occurred between the two armies, until in the year 16 AH (637 AD)[4] the battle of al-Qadesiyyah with the killing of Rostam; the Commander of the Iranian army, determined the conquest of Iran by Arab Muslims. Consequently, Mada\u2019en (known as the Constantinople of Khosro) was conquered. In the year 21 AH (642 AD) the Islamic army defeated the enemy in Nahawand. This battle was known as the \u2018Conquering of the Conquers\u2019 (\u0641\u062a\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062a\u0648\u062d), for since then nearly the whole of Iran was conquered with no major obstacles.  Today 99% of the total population of Iran are Muslims. Christian, Zoroastrian, and Jewish communities constituted less than 1 % of the population. After Iran, as a great empire at that time, many other nations simply converted to Islam. See: The History of the Spread of Islam How did Islam Spread? By Sword or By Conversion? ",

            "answer_text": "Does it not strike you as a fantastic coincidence that those who make the accusation that Islam spread by the sword usually have an agenda? A lot of the comments you come across are biased, whether the commentator admits it or not, be cautious. I am a Muslim myself and will try my best to answer. I will continue with a few examples as well. It is a ridiculous myth that a Muslim riding horseback gives the option of either death or conversion to a \u2018subjugated infidel\u2019, holding a Quran on the right hand, and a sword on the other. On the contrary, Muslims were persecuted in the city of Makkah by pagan Arabs (Makkans) and sought refuge in the city of Medina (Yathrib). Long story short, the Muslims started fighting back, and won. Shortly after, they consolidated their rule with neighbouring tribes by way of Islam, no forced conversions, no tyranny. Once the tribal communities started accepting Islam and pledging their allegiance to the Caliph, the then superpowers (Byzantine and Persia) felt a sense of threat and declared war on the Islamic community. In their defense, Muslims had to fight back. The Byzantines and the Persians were superpowers that fought over disputed territory till utter exhaustion, is was a stalemate and the Arabs often found themselves in between the two warring empires. The Persians and Byzantines levied heavy taxes (tributes) on their populace, living within either empire was no utopia. Nomadic Arab tribes were found in between Byzantine and Persian territory, these \u201cbuffer zones\u201d were an interest to the Caliph named Abu Bakr as he wished for his Arab brethren to join him in their conquest/battle, and convert to Islam. Long story short, the Muslims succeeded, and Jizya was mandatory for all non-muslims to pay. Gradually, most Persians converted to Islam which is the dominant religion of Iran till present day. There is no evidence that suggests the Persians were forced to convert to Islam by the sword. As a matter of fact, Zoroastrians still live in the province of Pars, in the Yazd and Kerman regions as they did centuries ago. What is Jizya? It\u2019s a military exemption tax for non-muslims under a caliphate. Muslim\u2019s can\u2019t force a non-muslim to fight for a muslim army if an invasion occurs, however under a caliphate, it is the duty of Muslims to defend and protect their citizens, whether Muslim or not. The Jizya was not a burden at all, the people were not taxed excessively. In fact, the elderly, the sick, women, the poor and disabled were exempted from paying Jizya. In fact, Muslims gave more charity alms (Zakat) than a non-muslim paying Jizya. There have been instances where non-muslims have been exempted from this tax, take for example a Christian tribe that fought along side with the Muslims, they were exempted from paying Jizya since they participated in battle. When it comes to Muslim Spain, Al-Andalus, it depends on what social frames you\u2019re looking through. For example, if you compare the Caliphate of the Iberian Peninsula (a theocracy) to the secular system you were born and raised in today, you would definitely consider some laws discriminative and unfair to non-Muslims and even non-arab muslims. However, if you are looking through a lens taking you back to the year 711, you\u2019ll come to find the successors (Muslims) were better rulers [more conscientious] than their predecessors (Visigoths) and that the Jews in particular were treated much better by the Muslims. Many Spaniards had converted to Islam during this period of time without any coercion to convert, and Muslims also coexisted peacefully with Jews and Christians. Was Islam spread by the sword here? Yet again, no. How did Islam first reach the Indian subcontinent? By Arab traders propagating the religion everywhere they went, in this case the Malabar coast. The people of Malabar embraced Islam and the rest is history. When it came to northern India, or present day Pakistan, Sufi missionaries would arrange da\u2019wah, which is a practice to invite people toward Islam. Artisans, merchants, traders and missionaries would settle in the region, and introduce the Sufic order of Islam to the locals. One of the primary reasons why those amongst the local Hindu population embraced Islam is because of the Hindu caste system, a belief system they no longer honored, as they felt disenfranchised, discriminated and ostracized coming from a lower caste (etc) or simply no longer adhered to the concept of karma. Arab traders also voyaged to Indonesia and Malaysia, the southern Philippines, and of course propagated Islam to the locals, who whole heartedly embraced the religion. No records of any military or navy, or any combatants headed towards the Islands to invade for the purpose of forcefully converting the population within. Unlike the Spanish and the Americans, the Arabs went to Indonesia/Malaysia/Philippines without the sword. Were there atrocious Muslims in history? The history of the practitioners of Islam is not perfect, if you dig into the past of any group, religion, or culture, you will come across shades of darkness. There have been Muslims in history who have committed egregious crimes, and had done awful things. Ex. Mahmud Ghazni and Nadir Shah looting northern India or Sultan Ahmad Mansur invading his fellow Muslim brethren in Mali for gold after Morrocco was financially drained from its war with the Portuguese. However, my point is, this in no way had anything to do with the spread of Islam. Hope this answer helps. ",
