Squanto, who met the Pilgrims shortly after they landed in 1620, knew English very well, and had even been to England (in 1605, 1615 and 1618). In most regions, natives who already knew English acted as translators between their tribe\u2019s other members and the settlers. But in two large regions, a simple jargon existed that had been used for centuries for inter-tribal communication, and many of the early settlers learned it (as had all traders who preceded them), so that they could speak directly with nearly all the natives they encountered. They were the Choctaw Jargon (spoken from Louisiana to Georgia, and into the Carolinas and Tennessee) and the Chinook Jargon (in the Pacific Northwest, and into Montana). ",

When they couldn't, they resorted to crude sign language and pictograms until usually a native learned enough English to interpret.  Most English speakers made no attempt to learn the differing language, and the rapid decimation of entire tribes and tribal communities and nations by pox and other diseases discouraged further direct contact.
