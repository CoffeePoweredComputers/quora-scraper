            "answer_text": "Oh, super strong. Don\u2019t tell anybody, but I saw the Aztecs deadlifting 700 lbs one time in the gym. Ok ok. For real now. Strong? Sure, in a manner of speaking. Mexico - especially their region of it - was very densely populated as far as we know. Estimates vary, because hey, its hard to estimate population for a context hundreds of years ago. But for Mexico as a whole, probably millions. Tenochtitlan, the Triple Alliance (\u201cAztec\u201d) capitol, appears to have been in the ballpark of Paris at the time - probably one of the most massive cities in Europe. So its fair to say that in terms of manpower, the TA was pretty powerful. It was also pretty remarkable militarily, albeit constrained in certain ways. The TA had been expanding, conquering, and consolidating for its entire history and based on the impressions of Bernal Diaz del Castillo, a conquistador who wrote about fighting them, their military was tough, disciplined, and ferocious - exactly what you\u2019d expect from a large and successful military with high espirit d\u2019corps. The things that held them back were largely out of their control; lack of large beasts of burden made logistics more difficult and certain tactics impossible, and lack of resistance to certain diseases proved the biggest issue. Compared to those, limited metalworking and no arquebusiers were pretty minor problems. Overall though, they were in fact quite militarily \u201cstrong.\u201d The defeat by Cortes was never a sure thing, and a lot had to go right for him and wrong for the TA, coupled with a few errors and misjudgements, for what happened to happen. Apart from that\u2026I mean, guys, the massive markets and huge trade network - built on FOOT (or by canoe) should indicate a lot of economic power, and that combined with a breathtaking military advantage over most of their neighbors should tell you a lot about their political influence. Granted, keeping the Tlaxcalans around turned out to be an issue\u2026but then again, conquest is expensive. It wasn\u2019t a problem until Cortes showed up and offered an out. The TA was pretty damn strong by anyone\u2019s standards. IMMENSELY strong for the context and region\u2026but with vulnerabilities that made \u201csudden influx of militarily potent outsiders with very different microbiomes\u201d a particularly severe problem.

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t classify civilizations into: Good and Bad. It doesn\u2019t work that way. The Aztecs were a reflection of their time and location. The other cultures they conquered also carried out human sacrifices and worshiped the same gods. How would you decide, if they were Good or Bad? Yes, they had human sacrifices. They also had public education for all, women married till they were 16\u201318 years old and could get a divorce, if their husband did not provide for them or beat them. They were then free to marry any man they chose. Europeans did not have public education for all, women could not, under any circumstance, get a divorce, much less remarry. The Aztecs had codified laws, just like the Europeans. They had poetry, just like the European. They valued their families and gods, just like the Europeans. They had close sewers, aqueducts, baths and gardens. Their city was so clean, the Spaniards were amazed. The Aztecs treated mental illness as a disease of the heart, and clearly established different treatments for anxiety, pathological fears and epilepsy. People who were mentally ill were not isolated, considered possessed and banished or killed, as they were in Europe. They did not believe in torturing people to make them confess associating with the devil, heresy or being Jews. To be sacrificed was an honor. So much so, that during the massacre at the Templo Mayor (the great temple) carried out by the Spaniards for no reason, the conquistadores decided to free the sacrificial victims, who were horrified and angered by this. Bernal D\u00edaz del castillo states this. So, then, were they \u201cGood\u201d or \u201cBad\u201d? Or just people of their time? ",
