            "answer_text": "Read Hitler\u2019s speeches and letters. He was SMART and stayed on message. He also had a solid platform based on combating the results of losing WW1 and the Depression. Donald is an idiot. He cannot stay on message \u2014 he has no message. He has no plan for growth, or to sustain the budget. Unlike Hitler, who was proud of German Social Programs, Donald couldn\u2019t care less about the average person. Donald cares about Donald and boasting how great he is. Hitler thanked people, and routinely reminded them that he had humble beginnings \u2014 was one of the normal people \u2026 and he routinely thanked \u201cprovidence\u201d for lifting him up. Also, Hitler improved over time. He learned and demonstrated that learning. In the early days, he wrote \u201cMein Kampf\u201d \u2014 but he did so with a basic education and, as he once reminded his audience, he wasn\u2019t a lawyer or other highly trained person and so it is foolish to measure his early work against more credentialed people. But, measured against Trump. Hitler knew the leaders of other countries, and the backgrounds of their staff. He also made references to history obscure analogies which only the more educated and intelligent would have been able to work into their speeches. And he did so without talking down to anyone. Compared to Hitler, Trump\u2019s IQ is sub-zero. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely; Hitler was a charlatan opportunist and fanatic, little more. Ironically, Trump understands Austrian economics better than Hitler, who was an actual Austrian (but that didn\u2019t stop fellow Austrian Arnold Schwarzenegger, who also trashed California\u2019s economy using similar economic sophistry). Trump knows the limits of taxation vs. inflation, and how \u201cless is more\u201d when it comes to optimizing an economy. Trump also understands true leadership through personal power vs. position-power; i.e. appeal vs. removing heads, and so he understands that persuasion is better than force. So in terms of intelligence; as Forrest Gump said \u201cstupid is as stupid does;\u201d i.e. it\u2019s how well he does the job that counts. And so far, he\u2019s doing pretty well. In contrast, Hitler killed the Golden Goose by controlled economy and a foreign policy of pure aggression, under a reign of terror. Good thing we dodged \u201cBloody Hillary.\u201d ",
