            "answer_text": "The film is so historically inaccurate that it serves more to slander some real people, some of which were or are still considered national or even international heroes. Some Examples. In the movie Marshall Zhukov, incorrectly referred to as field marshal Zhukov, plays a central role he didn\u2019t have. Zhukov was appointed minister after Stalin\u2019s death. He was a commander in the far east before that. He helped to arrest Beria 3 months after Stalin\u2019s death, not immediately after. Beria by the way, was not in charge of the secret police, or the NKVD. Particularly not the NKVD, which was disbanded in 1946. He was the minister of internal affairs during Stalin\u2019s death. Unlike in the movie Molotov was not the foreign minister, he was fired from that post in 1949, and only became so again after Stalin\u2019s death, as far as I know he played no part in the events around Stalin\u2019s death, though he does in the movie. The whole central cast was not even gathered for the events, which obviously were not nearly as ridiculous, as they are made out to be. Also, the whole tone of the movie, sadly isn\u2019t about Stalin, nor about his supporters being bad. It\u2019s about all of Soviets, all of Russians being wholesomely bad and funny only because of how incompetent and casually evil they all are. It implies Russians are still like this, and serves have some propaganda value in this. Kruschev and the Anti-Stalinist faction is also not portrayed as any better, they try to portray Kruschev as very sleazy. When in reality, he was the one who tried to reorganize the government to not be so dictatorial, and later denounced Stalinism entirely. In short, the movie is historically inaccurate to the point of a fairytale, and beyond comedy highly biased in it\u2019s presentation of history. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s see the historical facts.  The Nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was held from 5 to 14 October 1952 - 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union - Wikipedia. Below Stalin and Malenkov.  On 16 October the Central Committee kept a plenary meeting. After 70 years, Stalin\u2019s 1-hour and 30-minute speech is still secret. However, it is known that Stalin labelled Molotov and Vorosilov British spies - the wives of the 2 politicians being meanwhile imprisoned. During the elections, Stalin rejected the following: Andreev, Vorosilov, Kaganovich, Kosigin, Mikoyan and Molotov. Even more strange was the fact the Central Committee ignored Stalin\u2019s veto and chose all of them. Below Voroshilov, Beria and Malenkov  The politburo had 11 members: Stalin, Malenkov, Beria, Bulganin, Vorosilov, Kaganovich, Kosygin, Mikoyan, Molotov, Khrushchev and Andreev + 1 substitute member Shvernik. In order to manage \u2018\u2019the rebellion\u2019\u2019, Stalin proposed to increase the Central Committee number from 12 to 36. The proposal was accepted but the newcomers weren\u2019t used with the high level political tricks while the old guard kept united as they feared they would be purged. Stalin understood he couldn\u2019t rely on the newcomers and he ordered the arrests of all doctors of the \u2018\u2019rebellious\u2019\u2019 CC members. Starting with 5th of January, most of the friends or family of Khrushchev, Malenkov, Voroshilov or Kaganovich were arrested. Beria\u2019s associates were most heavily hit. Stalin also fired the chief of his personal guards the General Vlasik and his own personal secretary Pokrebisev. Due to his paranoia Stalin was alone. Below Kaganovici, Bulganin and Kruschev  One day before Stalin\u2019s death, Beria, Malenkov, Bulganin and Khrushchev visited Stalin\u2019s villa for reconciliation. After they left, nobody ever saw Stalin conscious. The next day the world was informed that Stalin was ill. Nobody knows exactly what happened.  On 5 March 1953 the CC Plenary of USSR met at 20\u203240 in a 10 minutes meeting. Stalin was not dead yet. The first decision was Stalin\u2019s removal from his position as Central Committee secretary. The CC number was restored to the previous 11 members, all newcomers were removed. 2 pro-Stalin members, Kosygin and Andreev were replaced by Pervuhin and Saburov. At 21\u203230 Stalin finally died. Officially Stalin died on 5 of March 1953, however the new chief of the government, Malenkov, was appointed on 4th of March. \ud83d\ude01   In 1953 after a workers\u2019 rebellion in East Berlin, Beria, who coordinated the repression returned to Moscow with the proposal to stop building socialism in East Germany.East German uprising of 1953 - Wikipedia.  On the 25th of June, Beria returned from Berlin being convinced that communism was not possible in East Germany. On the 26th of June, he was arrested as well as his most important associates. The leader of the group who arrested Beria was Zhukov. After this action Zhukov became full member of CC. In December 1953, the trial of Beria was conducted by Marshal Konev. General Baritki shot Beria. On the 13th of September 1953 Khrushchev was appointed prime-secretary of the CC of PCUS . On the 13th of March, 1954 Khrushchev founded KGB, replacing all various secret services coordinated by Beria. The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was held during the period 14\u201325 February 1956. It is known especially for First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev's \"Secret Speech\", which denounced the personality cult and dictatorship of Joseph Stalin.   ",

They took significant liberties just to make the material more comedy-friendly. About the only part that is pretty much as described in the history books is Stalin\u2019s actual death, with the uncertainties inherent in that there were few people present, and none of them had any particular reason to make sure any description was accurate. But there is one thing I think they got spot on. The absurdity. The feeling of everything being a shambles, and unlikely to get sorted even if they sat down and tried, which they were too busy backstabbing each other to do. The underlying dynamics, that they all had so powerful holds on each other that their room for manoeuvring was severely restricted. The pettiness and vindictiveness. The feeling that despite being the undisputed, absolute leaders of the country, they were in actual fact powerless to change or even control the situation. ",

His death occurred in roughly the way that the film (I\u2019ve not read the graphic novel I understand the film is based on) portrays - specifically that he lingered for a while, and this led to a rather complicated power struggle between his various lieutenants, which played out in roughly the way that the film shows. Some of the actors also look uncannily like the people they were portraying. Michael Palin and Vyacheslav Molotov could be distant relatives, based on some photos of the latter. The actual dialogue is largely invented for comic effect, of course. ",

Whether it was Beria or if it was Khrushchev who plotted the scheme will always be a mystery although most people think it was the former who was the ringleader. Zhores Medvedev writes an extremely accurate account of the events leading up to the death and thereafter. For those more inclined towards suspense Archangel is a good movie. ",

Someone I saw the move with described it as a documentary interspersed with slapstick. In truth, Stalin had at least 600,000 Soviet officials murdered in his purges, which went on most of his premiership. This is in addition to the millions of deaths through his intentional famine and collectivization of agriculture. Having people shot was his favorite method of purging. His daughter Svetlana Stalin\u2019s mother did commit suicide. She did it at least in part to protest Stalin\u2019s Ukrainian famine. His son was a general and died a young age of alcoholism. Some historians say there is reason to believe that security chief Beria did prevent medical attention for Stalin for quite some time after the stroke, although it cannot be proved or disproved. Beria used his power to force young girls and women to have sex with him. and when rumors that Stalin had been struck ill there was a race among at least some Stalin lieutenants to get to his dacha first.

It also is not historically accurate instead it uses the historical facts and character as a structure. The characters in the movies are not related to the real people. For example, historically Salieri was not such a villain and was not the person who took down dictation of Mozart\u2019s Requiem. The movie was not really about Mozart and Salieri but was an exploration of human envy. I consider \"Death of Stalin\" the same way. They are both fictionalized versions of history. BTW, if Donald Trump loses the election I am waiting for the producer to make a movie of the aftermath. ",

I loved the film and laughed my ass off the whole way through. when he was dying Beria spat in his face he then regained consciousness for a second and Beria fell to his knees begging for forgiveness Stalin then died they should have put that in I think. It covered some fairly historical points but a lot of it was glamed up so to speak for the film which I thought was necessary to keep it interesting. Accurate points his son was an alcoholic twit that had to be controlled by the party and everyone hated Beria and wanted him out. I particularly liked Jason Isaacs portrail of Georgy Zhukov was hilarious that man was a champion of the Soviet Union and a hard ass as a soldier! Eisenhower respected him so much that when he was president he found out one of his hobbies was fishing he sent him fishing equipment with his compliments which Zhukov used until the end of his days.

A hint of the quality of the toadies can be gained when Stalin screwed up his diplomacy and his management of the Red Army so badly that Hitler was able to waltz into the USSR. He apparently retreated to his dacha and waited for some-one to come and either shoot him or put him on public trial. Instead the top of the politburo flapped around for a while, and then came to his door to beg him to save them. Unbelievably disgusting. ",
