            "answer_text": "Lets break this down into the following steps: (Total surface area) X (% built up area) X (avg. floor area ratio) X (modern day construction cost per area of building) 1. Total surface area This one is easy. The Aurelian walls surround an area of 13.7 square kilometers (Source: Aurelian Walls ) The Piranesi map, just because:    2. % built up area This could probably be rather easily calculated. Instead, we'll look at the E.U.R. museum model and make some general assumptions:  Looks to be maybe about 50%? Lets go with 50%. Let's also assumed that this incorporates the lot coverage ratio. 3. FAR Rome was - very simplified - composed of public buildings, private residential houses (domus) and apartment complexes (insula). We'll assume an equal 1/3rd split for each type of building. (This could probably be refined by incorporating DUs per area for insula vs. domus in context of historic Roman population distribution between types of citizens - senators, equestrians, plebeians, etc - of which there should be decent sources). This is what a domus looked like:   We'll assume that a typical Roman domus was a bit more cramped than in more provincial cities. Let's go with 1.25 FAR on average for the domus - some parts two-story, but the majority one-story. Here is an insula:   Most were likely not this built up. We will assume an even FAR of 2.5 for this. The majority were likely two-story - with some built higher. So 2.5 FAR it is for the insula. Monuments we assume a flat FAR of 1. Temples, baths, forums, etc, were at most one story. The Flavian Amphiteathre, the circuses, etc probably had a higher FAR - but I will ignore that here. So FAR 1 for public buildings. 4. Cost per square meter We are going to go with 5000 EUR/sqm. Building something as large as Rome should get you economies of scale - but material cost would be high with all the marble or stone columns, the carvings, etc. 5. Conclusion: (13.7 * 10^6)*(0.5)*(1.25/3 + 2.5/3 + 1.25/3)*5000 = 54 B EUR. This seems very low though. We are likely drastically underestimating the cost per square meter of building the monuments in Rome.  ",
