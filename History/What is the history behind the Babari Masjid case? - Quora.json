            "answer_text": "As per historians Babri Masjid was built by a Muslim ruler in 14th century and it had been used for prayers for about 500 years by Muslims of India but Lord Rama was born as per Hindu saints about 15,000 years ago when the Babri Masjid site was a primary jungle Demolition of Babri was the root cause of religion based terrorism in India. It served its purpose by dishonestly allowing fundamentalists to come to power in India, but in a way it is a good thing, the minorities sacrificed a lot in terms of lives and property, but indirectly they helped Indian secularism NOW , there is some construction in destruction, that is the law of God. There is not a single example in the history of Medieval history of India that Hindus (read Brahmins) tried to awaken common Hindus(non-Brahmins) against the Muslim rulers or carried out open or underground movement for overthrowing the Muslim rulers. On the other hand, Medieval history is replete with examples of Brahmins having assisted Muslim rulers in managing their affairs. Among the Mogul ruler Akbar\u2019 Navratna, there were many Brahmins, Tippu Sultans main advisors and administrators were Brahmins. In the Durbar of Aurangzeb, more than 50% were Brahmins. Only because of the support of Brahmins, the Muslims could rule India comfortably for about 700 years. So the claim of Golwalkar that (Book: We or Our nationhood Defined), \u201cEver since that evil day, when Muslims landed in Hindustan right up to the present moment , the Hindu nation has been gallantly fighting on to take these despoilers,\u201d appears a blatant lie, unless he meant to exclude Brahmins from the term \u201cHindu Nation\u201d As long as ignorant people exist in India, many more Babri Masjids can be demolished, and sure, many Ram temples can be built, Many brain washed accept the ultra Brahmanist definition of Indian nation. There is nothing much that can be done to prevent this rot unless foolish people get the correct sort of education. RSS has 7 million card holders and they can assemble them together in a month and go to Ayodhya and start building a temple at the Babri Masjid site and Indian IB and Police will do nothing to prevent, and after building the Temple if Congress come back to power then there will be another judicial commission and nothing in the commission report will be implemented this is our democracy. This is the way we deal with the political wrongdoers in the society, the police will not arrest the thugs as they are scared that it might lead to more killing and more blood shed, This is why God has his own way of punishment to punish such criminals and the nation of criminals. Ask the Muslims for land to build a temple, they will give, this has happened many times in India, but do not try to bully people and force them and make them agree by killing them as it happened in Gujarat in 2002, then, we will face the consequences of destroying India\u2019s secularism and common Hindu Muslim brotherhood of humanity and destabilizing the efforts in building inter-faith bridges of tolerance and understanding .
