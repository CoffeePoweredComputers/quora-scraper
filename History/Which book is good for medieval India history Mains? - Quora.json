            "answer_text": "Medieval India is a tale of diversities,in fact history is synonymous with continuity and to analyse and explain the convulsions of time is one of its various specialities. The interregnum between the death of Harsha in the mid-seventh century( 648AD) and the rise of the Delhi Sultanate nearly six hundred years later is often viewed as a tedious epoch in Indian History, it is accepted that there is a period of overlap during which one phase blends into the other. This interim period is now called \u201cearly medieval India\u201d, with the medieval period, properly speaking, regarded as beginning with the establishment of Turkish rule in a Delhi in 1206AD. The currents of feudalism from within and establishment of a new ruling class from without, became propellants, instigating momentous changes in Indian history at social,economic, and cultural levels. The native people came to terms with the Muslim social setup in the form of a ruling class, and this ruling class got opportunity to interact and gradually evolved into a composite culture. Before embarking upon a study of medieval Indian history, it is pertinent to understand the following essentials: Medieval period should not be read in isolation from other periods, understand the society of the time ( say 8th C A.D) where there was no big empire, north India splintered into small states with differences and rivalry, no nationalism existed and very reason why Mahmud of Ghaznavi invaded leading up to invasion of Mohammed of Ghori. Political maximisation post-Delhi Sultanate by the establishment of centralised Mughal empire.Contribution of Islam and conversion to Islam, the aura created by Sufi saints in creating a just society without casteism, discrimination. Is is for this reason that reformist current ensued in medieval times leading to Bhakti movement, Sufism, Sikhism evolution and many other social and cultural revolution.the decline of Great Mughals and the subsequent emergence of powerful regional states. And the historical lull, few call this as the Dark age! Find out why there is so much controversy there.. then the arrival of British power.It is needless to say , rather than concentrating on genealogical history of who rule at what time period, it would be fruitful to dig deep an established the undercurrent of socio-cultural aspects leading to politics of the day and the important role played by religion to establish and dominate the medieval times.Some LIGHT BOOKS to start up: NCERT books - an indispensable first book to beginSatish Chandra - Medieval India part I ,IISunil Kumar - The emergence of Delhi SultanateP.
