            "answer_text": "Hitler had 2 pistols present with him during his suicide.  Both of these pistols were lying in front of Hitler\u2019s dead body.  Testimonies had said Artur Axmann, who was F\u00fchrer of the Hitlerjugend, took the Walther PP pistol. Axmann managed to escape to the west but was captured. It was known he had the pistol so he was asked where it was. He claimed to have buried by Sandkrug Bridge. The Walther PPK was taken as a war trophy. It was said that Stalin kept it on his desk and referred to it as the gun that Hitler used to kill himself with. I think the PPK is still in Russia today, or was destroyed. I\u2019m sure someone in the comments will kindly correct me. :D As for the Walther PP. Its remains are currently unknown and it still might be buried somewhere in Berlin as Axmann stated.  This piece is skull was believed to have belonged to Hitler. It had a bullet hole so people were certain. However; it does NOT belong to Hitler. It belonged to a woman in her 30\u2019s or 40\u2019s.  Heinz Linge was the first person to enter the room after Hitler killed himself. He claimed Hitler shot himself in the right temple. Others said he shot himself under his chin. Hence, the testimonies became unreliable. But the skull was proven that it did not belong to Hitler anyway. With the skull not belonging to Hitler and 2 pistols at his feet, it is unknown which pistol he used to kill himself with. Pistol\u2019s worth? It would be hard to say how much the pistols would be worth. Let\u2019s do some comparison\u2026  This is a gold Walther PP that was personally given to Hitler on his 50th birthday on April 20th, 1939 by Walther. In 1987, this pistol was sold at an auction for $114,000. In 2020, equivalent to $257,292. A WWII era PPK can be sold for $1,700 in 2020. Anything related to Hitler can be worth a lot, for example: Hitler\u2019s autograph can be worth $20,000 to even $100,000 depending what it\u2019s written on. In this case, his personal pistol that he killed himself with. Which is arguably one of the most famous pistols of all time. I\u2019m guessing it would be worth more than $700,000. I got this number by figuring a good number of what Hitler\u2019s belongings might be worth and comparing it to G\u00f6ring personal pistol which sold for around $400,000 in 2016. ",

            "answer_text": "On April 30th, 1945 Hitler had killed himself with his 7.65 millimeter Walther PPK pistol. Over the years, Hitler owned several PP and PPK pistols, but this was the specific one he used to kill himself.  (A model of the Walther PPK/PP pistol) The Walther PPK pistol is part of a group of PP guns originally manufactured in the state of Thuringa, Germany. During the time the Soviets occupied Germany, the Allies forbade any manufacturing of weapons or artillery in germany. Therefore in 1952, the production was moved to a French company. The PPK was issued to High ranking officers, police, luffwaffle members, and intelligence services. It was once stated to be the most successful double action blow back pistols in the world. The PPK/PP is short for Police Pistol Detective model. The model was popular among European police stations and civilians. Hitler also owned a golden version of the gun. On Hitler\u2019s 50th birthday, the Nazi Party celebrated him with giving Hitler a Golden pistol. The pistol was gold semi - automatic pistol with his initials from Karl Walther. Walter made hundreds of guns which have sold worldwide.  (Hilter's golden PPK pistol with his initials) Hitler had a liking for firearms, so he prized the gun out of all the presents. Herman Goring also had a similar gun with his initials on the handle. What would be the cost of Hitler's guns? Hitler\u2019s golden PPK pistol was worth $114,000 in 1987. At the time, that was the highest amount paid for a military memorabilia. After the war, the gun landed in many owners hands. Now Hitler's suicide gun is a trickier question. The pistol price and worth have not been stated online. Herman Goring's gold plated gun was auctioned for about 400,000 dollars, which Hitler's would cost more (because Hitler is more prominent). I would estimate that Hitler's suicide PPK pistol would probably cost more than $600,000 and less than $900,000 on an auction. ",
