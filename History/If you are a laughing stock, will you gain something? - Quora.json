            "answer_text": "Yes of course. Being a laughing stock primarily makes you feel insecure and worthless. Your level of self-esteem will go down. On the positive side, you will gain an inspiration to do something that will change all these scenarios. A person should be motivated to improve and make good in some other things that will give him/her all the respect. See the reasons why you are a laughing stock. Work that one out. When it happened once or twice, that\u2019s just okay. At least you make them happy. But all the time laughing at you, well, that\u2019s not healthy anymore. Got to do something, my friend. ",
