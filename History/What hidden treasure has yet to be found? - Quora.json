            "answer_text": "Rose Anne, there are a lot. There's no concrete evidence that any appreciable amount of the Confederate Treasury has been found. Though apocryphal stories have long circulated of a portion of it having been found buried within easy sight of the railroad tracks, in iron wash pots, spaced several hundred yards apart between McCleansville N.C. And Gibsonville N.C. This could be credible as Jefferson Davis undoubtedly fled through the area and his train is rumored to have stopped in the area before continuing on to Greensboro where he rested. However, even if true, evidence suggests that the treasury was divided into four or five caches. Other areas with reasonable claims include Danville, Virginia, in a cemetery no less, where even today, cryptic smbols from the Knights of the Golden Circle are still carved into some trees. Many believe that the KGC, the forerunners of the Ku Klux Klan, almost certainly would have been chosen as the overseers of at least a portion of the treasury. A town in Georgia, name eludes me, may well have some as Davis was captured there. All hell definitely broke loose and evidence exists that part of it at least was captured by two different groups there and re-cached. One was a group of sharpshooters and snipers from Tennessee, led by a rogue commander, who had been mustered out some days before the final capture of Davis. Though they weren't supposed to be there, spent ammunition unique to them as been found at the capture site and it is likely that they turned robber, following and waylaying the treasure days later. Making off with a large portion of it and cacheing some of it in the hills, hollers, and mountains of Tennessee. Some may have been smelted and spent of course but many believe that multiple small caches await finding. Confederate gold coins being so rare, even a few could be worth a lot. Strong evidence also suggest a Union group from Michigan also captured a large portion. Cached it and returned during reconstruction to liberate it from its Southern hidey hole. This is the premise of the history channel show, \"Lost Civil War Gold\". Other treasures still extant are Montezuma's Treasure, likely buried near Kanab, Utah in a mountain side but not currently accessible due to land owner's belief in a curse. The treasury of Lima was huge and said to include a life sized gold statuary of the Virgin Mary. It is rumored to be buried on Cocos Island. Some of Jesse James treasure is known to have been recovered but he was a prolific robber and one who cached a lot. No doubt some remains. Several known Galleons of the doomed 1715 Spanish Plate Fleet have never been found. Also at least one ship from the 1732 Plate Fleet is rumored to have foundered in Topsail Bay off Topsail Island in North Carolina. General Cornwallis recorded having cached and dynamited over a hoard of silver and perhaps gold, pillaged from the Colonists, especially the richer ones around Charlotte N.C. Harassed and pressured by Greene's army, he lightened their load somewhere near the banks of Abbott Creek in the vicinity of Lexington N.C. He then used explosives to trigger a landslide. Weeks later, he surrendered to Washington at Yorktown. Parts of what may have been the largest and most valuable treasure ever buried, The Golden Lily hoard, have been found. This is composed of the treasuries of and finest objects de art, of Asian countries looted and brutally pillaged by the Japanese, part of their reign of rape and murder across Asia, prior to and during WWII. However, the vast majority almost certainly remains. Much of it protected by explosive booby traps, water traps, dead falls, and other brilliant but nefarious means. It is estimated that as much as one trillion dollars in stolen valuables could remain. Cached there under the direction of and sometimes the direct supervision of General Yamashita. Philippine despot Ferdinand Marcos derived most if not all of his wealth by directing his soldiers to search and recover portions of this treasure. He also stole it from treasure hunters who found it. He even had a court judgement issued against him for having stolen a huge Golden Buddha found by a treasure hunter near Bagaio. Not to be left out, General John Singlaub is said to have used his CIA connections to recover a portion. In fact it is believed by many that rogue CIA agents have used their access to unpublished government intel, to surreptiously and no doubt illegally, recover and convert to personal use, treasures from all over the world. Even President Lyndon Baines Johnson is rumored to have been at the heart of a scheme, while President, to liberate gold bars found inside Victorio Peak in New Mexico, to his ranch in Texas. But that is pretty questionable. These are but a few of the better known treasures waiting to be found. No doubt there are many more as drug dealers, thieves, and juvenile delinquents still have to put their loot somewhere. Not to mention misers. ",

            "answer_text": "There are way too many to list. One of them is the lost tomb of Genghis Kahn. The story goes that when Kahn died, a thousand slaves dug his tomb. When he was buried, the crowns and thrones of all the kingdoms he had defeated were buried with him. Next, an army rode horses over the tomb till the ground was hardened. Slaves then planted grass and mature trees over the area until the grave was totally hidden. The slaves were then killed. The army then returned to their post and they were also slain so that there would be no live person who knew where the tomb was located. It has never been found, mostly due to the fact that the Chinese government won\u2019t allow anyone to look for it. The only fact that is known about its location is that it is in Mongolia. Another lost treasure was on board one of the Manila Galleons. In 1200 and 1300s all of the trade from the Orient was conducted in Manila in the Philippines. Since there was no Panama Canal, the Spanish commanded an unknown number of ships to sail south around the tip of South America and conduct trade in Manila. A lot of Chinese porcelain and jade was traded along with silver and gold. These treasure-laden ships would then sail to the Pacific side of the Panama Isthmus. The cargo would be off-loaded onto donkey carts then transported across the isthmus to the Atlantic side where it would be warehoused until a galleon from Spain was able to load the cargo and transport it back to Spain. One of those Manila Galleons went down in the Pacific Ocean with a chariot made of solid jade. It is said to be priceless. Anyway, Anne, there are two lost treasures for you to ponder. ",
