            "answer_text": "There are a lot of falsehoods regarding Japanese warfare. People call it static and unchanging, but that could not be further from the truth. The Japanese used siege towers, mangonels, and other advanced siege equipment. Castles were designed and placed with great care, and the engineering race between clans for large castles was famous. Japanese warfare lacked a developed cavalry charge, due to the small breed of local horses being Ill suited for charging until Takeda Shingen imported large horses. He then made his clan have a dominant cavalry charge, but while powerful, it was not the decisive edge that would win the constant, and constantly evolving, warfare between the Japanese clans. Firearms, brought by European traders, we're the decisive edge, and the Japanese made many innovations to the gun in a few decades that Europe would take centuries to make, like sights on the barrel of the gun, and the matchlock setup replacing the flintlock. Tactics regarding these and many other innovations made Japanese warfare made the battlefield a different place for each generation. Europe had a similar situation. Advancing armor, weapons, and equipment changed European battlefields on a regular basis. The big difference is the code of honor the Japanese fought by. It focused on very different things compared m to the European counterpart, and produced warriors willing to do different things. For example, European kn I this would not attack the rear of an opponent, as their honour was only gained in frontal attacks. Samurai had no such restrictions; victory was more important than personal honor, and loyalty to your lord was the big thing. Knights were not as loyal to lords and we're more loyal to ideals. This difference is one example of how each culture fought with different expectations. Another example is prisoner taking. It almost never happened in Japan, but in Europe, it was a mainstay of war, and quite common. ",

            "answer_text": "Europe was constantly changing it's battlefield tactics - one of the reasons was massive warfares of religious type during the crusades, Mongol invasions that threatened the Eastern Europe, new developments of infantry tactics in the West and basically Europe is huge geographically and culturally compared to relatively small, easily isolated and homogeneous Japan. Just the development of two most known symbols of the feudal systems - katana and longsword shows the difference. Longsword changed in size and quality, you can strike with pommel, grip with cross-guard, slice and punch with the blade, some German medieval manuals showed ways of switching the stance of your longsword to use cross-guard like a piercing warhammer, nothing of this can be done with katana since it became a ritual weapon, samurai's battlefield was a ritual battlefield with strict rules, while knights in Europe constantly developed new ways of beating each other. When one small Mongol convoy managed to reach mainland Japan despite the typhoon, the samurai's were outraged that their enemies discharged arrows at them without proper warning and rules of war! Still as being said, isolation of Japan prevented the change and adoption of new ways of fighting, until Portuguese came and introduced back then modern firearms and armor. ",

            "answer_text": "One approach to this question is to discuss similarities and differences. Here are some broad similarities: Use of cavalry, typically calvarymen were upper class members with protective armorConscript infantry with relatively less training, armor, less expensive weaponsuse of Castle / fortifications and siege warfareProjectile weapons - bows, long bow, crossbowuse of boats/ships near coasts, riversDifferences: I'm not sure if the engineering side of siege warfare was as developed in Japan as in Europe, I'm unaware of any Japanese catapults/onagers/trebuchets.Religious orders as a military force - from approximately the 10th century until the 16th century in Japan various Buddhist monasteries maintained powerful standing fighting forces, the largest of which might be considered armies (the defenders of Ishiyama Hongoji had 15,000? defenders).  Until they were destroyed by Oda Nobunaga and his vassals, they were a force to be reckoned with. Was there an equivalent in Europe? Or would the Papacy/Vatican have played a similar role during certain parts of medieval European history?Terrain - In Japan there weren't that many large flat open areas in which to fight, during flooding rice paddies would be terrible places to fight. What would it have been like in Europe fighting in a field cultivated with 'ridge and furrow' ? Or was fighting in Europe typically done in meadows and pastures? (Japan had fewer of those since fewer grazing animals) I do want to mention, that contrary to the impression given by Japanese literature and legend, the military technology of Japan was not static, and evolved continously from the first century. Originally Japanese swords were straight, but in response to the change to using horse mounted troops  [horses were introduced to Japan in around the fifth century], the straight swords were replaced by a longer curve blade, the tachi, the long blade was good for striking down from horseback.  The tachi was in turn replaced by the somewhat shorter less expensive katana - more agile in closer combat The evolution of the tachi into the katana seems to have started during the early Muromachi period (1337 to 1573) For a long time, the \"way\" of the military class (bushi) was 'the way of the horse and the bow'. Notice this does not mention any sword.  During the majority of the Kamakura period through the Muromachi period (c.1185\u2013c.1568), the bow was almost exclusively the symbol of the  professional warrior, and way of life of the warrior was referred to as  \"the way of the horse and bow\" (\u5f13\u99ac\u306e\u9053 ky\u016bba no michi?).[2] Archery and horseback archery was a very important skill.  There are descriptions of training and contests in which stray dogs were rounded up and penned, and then released to be \"hunted\" by mounted archers, sometimes with blunt tip arrows.  A running dog was thought to be a good (difficult) practice target.Another weapons innovation was the naginata. Although its date of introduction is uncertain, its use by foot soldiers required a corresponding change in armor. During the Gempei War (1180\u20131185), in which the Taira clan was pitted against Minamoto no Yoritomo of the Minamoto clan, the naginata rose to a position of particularly high esteem, being regarded as an extremely effective weapon by warriors.[12] Cavalry battles had become more important by this time, and the naginata proved excellent at dismounting cavalry and disabling riders. The widespread adoption of the naginata as a battlefield weapon forced the introduction of sune-ate (shin guards) as a part of Japanese armor.  The naginata was supplanted as an infantry weapon by the spear - cheaper to make and easier to train a farmer (peasant) to wield. Later when the firearm arrived in Japan, they were quickly adopted and changed strategy and tactics. It is possible that by the middle of the 16th century there were more guns in Japan than in Europe The first documented introduction of the matchlock which became known as the tanegashima was through the Portuguese in 1543.[3]  ... The lord of the Japanese  island Tanegashima Tokitaka (1528\u20131579) purchased two matchlock  muskets from the Portuguese and put a swordsmith to work in copying the  matchlock barrel and firing mechanism. Within a few years the use of the  tanegashima in battle forever changed the way war was fought in Japan.[5] ",
