            "answer_text": "There are a number of articles online about the Tudor kitchen, including this fun Pinterest board: tudor food. The Historic Royal Palaces site above is great and there are a number of videos online from the chefs who work in the kitchen recreating meals from old recipes. (Look also for Dr. Lucy Worsley's videos, which are great fun.)  Most focus on the vast variety of exotic foods that were served to the high table, which included an array of meats, fish, and vegetables. These dishes were served first to the high-table and then to the courtiers. At each stop on a progress, the chefs tried to outdo and impress their guests and earn Royal favor. Food for the vast retinue of servants were made from lesser cuts of meat, bones, offal, and vegetable trimmings. Although it was a vast amount of food, nothing went to waste. Gelatins were made from the bones, meat and fish were salted to preserve it, scraps were fed to livestock (next night's dinner), and exotic spices like Nutmeg and Pepper permeated meats and sweets, alike. (The only servant allowed as much beer as he wanted was the turn-spit boy, who labored for hours a day in front of an open fire turning dozens of spits loaded with roasting meats.)  While the array of dishes and fanciful sweets are mind-boggling to the modern reader, there is one modern ingredient missing, sugar. Sugar, in sustainable quantities, made its way into the modern English court diet during Elizabeth's reign \u2014 and boy did it. The Elizabethans loved sugar so much that they added it to nearly every dish they could, including roasted meats. From imported cane sugar, to honey, to increased use of fruit in savory dishes, sugar use boomed. Elizabeth herself felt the effects, sporting teeth darkened by decay \u2014 which, of course, became the fashion amongst the ladies, who painted their teeth gray in return. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of food.  Henry VIII was known for his voracious appetite, and when he wasn't busy marrying and divorcing and/or beheading his wives, he ate a whole lot.  Henry VIII liked banquets so much that he extended the kitchen of Hampton Court Palace to fill 55 rooms, with the 200 members of the kitchen staff providing meals of up to 14 courses for the 600 people in his court.  Some items you'd expect to see on the menu include spit-roasted meat, grilled beavers' tails, whale meat, whole roasted peacock, internal organs, black pudding, boar's head, roasted swan, marzipan, spiced fruitcake, wine and ale.  The only thing he didn't eat that much was vegetables, which at the time was viewed as the food of the \"poor\"; overall, vegetables made up less than 20 percent of the royal diet. ",
