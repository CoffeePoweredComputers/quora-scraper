            "answer_text": "The case of the Irish is quite unusual, since normally a subjugated people adopt the religion of their conquerors but keep their language. Imagine if the Albanians and Bosniaks in the Balkans switched to speaking Turkish but remained Christian \u2014 that\u2019s the Irish. But there are a few different reasons that English took over, but not Protestantism. First of all, the English language was a dominant minority language for hundreds of years. To get advantages in the cities or government, they had to know English. This isn\u2019t unusual for other peoples, such as the Finns who had to learn Swedish, or the Czechs with German. But it\u2019s the first step. There was even an Irish form of Middle English called Yola, and the name for the English language in Irish is B\u00e9arla, rather than something like Sassenach as the Scots use, meaning something like \u201cthe speech\u201d, an import from Norman and cognate to French parler, which would suggest that English was not considered a fully foreign language even during the early part of the millennium.Secondly, conversion to Protestantism was largely a one-off thing, happening during the tumult of the early to mid 1500s, and was in fact largely a political movement enforced from the top down by various rulers. Generally speaking, if a people hadn\u2019t (or wasn\u2019t) converted to Protestantism by the Council of Trent (1545\u20131563), it wouldn\u2019t be ever. If anything, there was some leakage of people back to Catholicism, such as in large parts of Central Europe, but large-scale conversion to Protestantism was more or less over \u2014 at least until recently after the Second Vatican Council.Furthermore, there was more resistance to converting to Protestantism in Britain than there was in continental Europe. While Catholicism practically vanished from Scandinavia, Northern England and the Scottish highlands in particular retained a large Catholic minority, and in the English Pale, the center of English settlement and power in Ireland, Catholic recusancy (refusal to convert to Protestantism) was almost certainly an absolute majority, even if the Protestant Church of Ireland was official. The local English and Norman notables in Ireland known as the \u201cOld English\u201d, in other words, refused to convert, and so the Irish population at large didn\u2019t either, as conversion to Protestantism was a top-down thing as mentioned before. This was in fact a large impetus for Cromwell\u2019s campaign and the Protestant settlement of Northern Ireland, where committed Protestants were encouraged to settle in Ulster \u2014 the English Pale was Catholic and couldn\u2019t be relied on. At the same time, it was also a crucial seed for establishing the English language among the Catholic Irish.The crucial X factor that killed Irish, however, was the potato famine and emigration. About 90% of the descendants of the Irish living in the early 1800s live outside of Ireland now, with 80% in the United States alone. The pressure to learn English, even among the poor, was enormous, because Irish would be of no use in North America, and wouldn\u2019t be as useful as English in Ireland\u2019s cities if they wanted to get passage out. Why I say this was the X factor is because other languages in that position, including Welsh, didn\u2019t have this. In the rural areas of Wales, people were forced to use English in school, but that was also the case in continental Europe as with the Finns or Czechs. By the end of the 19th century, the vast majority of Irish knew English or were actually more comfortable using English than Irish, and because of this, revitalization efforts in Irish were halfhearted and disorganized. It was seen as an extra burden among the common people while they were trying to make a living, so the habit of using English and neglecting Irish persisted.So this happened due to a number of factors, some of which were also the case for other ethnic languages with no official protection elsewhere in Europe, and others which were specific to the case of Ireland.

Irish language - Wikipedia From the 18th century on, the language lost ground in the east of the country. The reasons behind this shift were complex but came down to a number of factors: Discouragement of its use by Anglo-British administrations.The Catholic church supporting the use of English over Irish.The spread of bilingualism from the 1750s, resulting in language shift.Irish was not marginal to Ireland's modernisation in the 19th century, as often assumed. In the first half of the century there were still around three million people for whom Irish was the primary language, and their numbers alone made them a cultural and social force. Irish speakers often insisted on using the language in law courts (even when they knew English), and Irish was also common in commercial transactions. The language was heavily implicated in the \"devotional revolution\" which marked the standardisation of Catholic religious practice and was also widely used in a political context. Down to the time of the Great Famine and even afterwards, the language was in use by all classes, Irish being an urban as well as a rural language. ",
