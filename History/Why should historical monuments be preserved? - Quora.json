            "answer_text": "(My response to a very similar question) Why should they, indeed? That might sound like an odd way for a historic preservationist to answer a question about preserving the past. But preservation of any sort- be it cultural or societal values, historic properties, or wildlife and natural landscapes- ultimately depends on what the people who compose that culture and society value. That is not only hard to pin down to start with- after all, we\u2019re seven billion people and counting, all with different ideas and backgrounds- and it also changes over time. The recent (and certainly ongoing) furor over Confederate monuments in the United States is a perfect example. There is a document called the Secretary of the Interior Standards for the Evaluation of Historic Properties. It contains Federal guidelines that determine if an object (anything from a Native American arrowhead to a bridge to a statue of Robert E. Lee to Canyon de Chelly, theoretically) is historically significant. Guidelines, meaning they are not mandatory. The first thing I learned as a historic preservationist is, you can't save them all. The second thing I learned is, some aren't really worth saving. And so some cities have opted to remove Confederate monuments that may be historically significant in of themselves according to these guidelines, because those monuments no longer represent that city\u2019s values. Some cities have opted to leave these monuments in place. And that same idea goes for anything we can \u201cpreserve\u201d - nature preserves, historic houses, the USS Lexington on display in Corpus Christi, all the wonderful works on display in MoMA and the Guggenheim. I will tell you why I think historic monuments should be preserved, though: they provide context. They link us in the present- and those in the future- with historic periods of history, with important people in history, with our ideals (again, the issue of Confederate monuments), with past architectural styles and ways of living, with important events in history.
