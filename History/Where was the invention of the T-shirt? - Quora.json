            "answer_text": "The Origin of the T-Shirt The t-shirt as we know it today is an apparel staple. The simple garment is so deeply ingrained in world culture that it\u2019s easy to forget that, relatively speaking, the t-shirt itself is quite young. The origins of the t-shirt date back to the late 19th century, when laborers would cut their jumpsuits in half to keep cool in warmer months during the year. The first manufactured t-shirt was invented between the Mexican-American War in 1898, and 1913 when the U.S. Navy began issuing them as standard undershirts.  Even then, it took until 1920 for the actual term \u201ct-shirt\u201d to be inducted into the English dictionary, thanks to F. Scott Fitzgerald being the first person to publish the word in his novel This Side of Paradise. \u201cSo early in September Amory,\u201d writes Fitzgerald, \u201cprovided with \u2018six suits summer underwear, six suits winter underwear, one sweater or T-shirt, one jersey, one overcoat, winter, etc,\u2019 set out for New England, the land of schools.\u201d Brando, Dean and Rebellion Though the t-shirt was created in the early 20th century, it was rare to see it worn as anything other than an undershirt. It wasn\u2019t uncommon to see veterans wearing a t-shirt tucked into their trousers post-World War II, but outside of that, t-shirts were almost exclusively used underneath \u201cproper\u201d clothes. \u201c[The T-shirt] is a really basic way of telling the world who and what you are.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aDennis Nothdruft Then came Marlon Brando and James Dean. In 1950, Marlon Brando famously dawned a white t-shirt as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire, only to be followed by James Dean in 1955's Rebel Without a Cause. Thanks to these two founding fathers, the popularity of the t-shirt as a stand-alone outerwear garment skyrocketed.  Not only was the t-shirt as an outer-garment becoming acceptable, but it was also being associated with a movement of rebellion. \u201cIt was rebellious, because T-shirts were actually undergarments \u2026 It was a tough political statement,\u201d says Dennis Nothdruft, curator of the exhibition titled T-shirt: Cult \u2014 Culture \u2014 Subversion,which showcased the radical history of the t-shirt at the Fashion and Textile Museum in London last year. Graphic T-Shirts and the Birth of T-Shirt Printers By the time the 1950s rolled around, a number of companies in Miami, Florida began experimenting with garment decoration, but the field was still far from what would later turn into a multi-billion dollar industry of t-shirt printing. Thomas E. Dewey, a Republican presidential candidate, created what was perhaps the first ever slogan t-shirt with his \u201cDo it with Dewey\u201d campaign, but outside of that, there were not many instances of embellished t-shirts. Later in the 1950s though, one of the aforementioned printing companies, known then by the name Tropix Togs, held the original license to print Walt Disney characters. Around this time people began to realize the profit that was to be made in graphic t-shirts, and in the 1960s, innovations to the print field, including the birth of screenprinting, would help turn the t-shirt industry into what it is today. \u201cThe Medium for the Message\u201d Though graphic t-shirts and t-shirt printing began in the 1950s and 1960s, it wasn\u2019t until the \u201970s that t-shirts became the powerful messaging platform that we know them as today. For this, we can thank the punk movement. Rising popularity in rock band logos, along with protests of the Vietnam War, really helped solidify the t-shirt as a messaging platform. It was \u201cabout shocking and outraging people and challenging the status quo,\u201d says Nothdruft. The New York Times perhaps said it best, when the rise of the graphic t-shirt lead them to name it \u201cthe medium for the message.\u201d  Nothdruft, in his description of the exhibit, calls the t-shirt a \u201cblank canvas \u2026 [that] associates you with a specific cultural movement or tribe.\u201d Certainly, the t-shirt\u2019s fluid nature plays a part in its wide appeal. A blank canvas, a t-shirt can be seen as high fashion or casual wear, disruptive or unassuming, all depending on how you wear it. \u201cIn its most pure form, it\u2019s the most democratic garment,\u201d says Northdruft to BBC.  Not Going Anywhere Soon All of this to say, the t-shirt has become not only an American staple, but an essential garment worn around the world, and their unique ability to convey a message hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. From SNL hosts\u2019 various viral t-shirt moments to Dior\u2019s famous \u201cwe should all be feminists\u201d design, t-shirts are proven to be a preferred medium for sharing messages ranging from rebellious to joyful and everything in between.

            "answer_text": "In 1876, a Samuel T. Cooper of Michigan founded 'Coopers Inc', an outfit which started out to make socks for lumberjacks. In 1900, the company expanded their range to include underwear. It was a time when clothes, both under and outer, were held together by buttons, clasps, hooks and eyes and so on. In fact all pieces of clothing in the period would appear to have been pretty elaborate affairs. Alas, few men, if any, could sew. And when a button parted company with its garment, wives or mothers would be dragooned in to perform the task of putting it back on again. As for men living alone, they had to resort to the good old safety pin. Clearly there was a gap in the market, and it was a gap which Coopers decided to fill. To that end, in 1904, they invented what they called a 'bachelor undershirt'... a no buttons, no clasps, no flaps, or indeed no anything else, no nonsense under-garment. The utilitarian design (no buttons for one thing) obviously appealed to the U.S, Navy, and so, the following year, it decreed that it be worn under the normal uniform. The actual name \u2018T \u2013 Shirt\u2019 is credited with having been coined in 1920 by the writer F. Scott Fitzgerald (September 24, 1896 \u2013 December 21, 1940). The actual shape of the thing inspiring his coining. Seemingly, the first time the word appears in print is in his novel 'This Side of Paradise'. Personally, having never read the work, I really wouldn\u2019t know. To conclude, this item (T-shirt) has got to be one of most people\u2019s favorite inventions of all time. And should anyone be interested - which I very much doubt - it is the sole upper garment I am wearing as I write this answer. Anyway, I trust that the above helps. ",
