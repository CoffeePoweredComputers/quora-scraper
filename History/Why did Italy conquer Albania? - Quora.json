            "answer_text": "In 1939, Italy conquered Albania for a handful of reasons. The main reason one would assume, is because it was part of the war. Yes, Mussolini wanted to achieve the big dream of recreating the Roman Empire, but Albania wasn\u2019t his goal at all. Here is a background of events that led to the fascist occupation. In ancient times, Albania(Illyria) was part of the Roman Empire. Because of the Illyrians starting many revolts, the Roman troops were sent there in multiple wars to set a permanent Roman culture and cease any means of unification among the tribes. This resulted in a long relationship between the two countries, and also because of the short distance between them.During the Ottoman invasion, the kingdoms and the papal states of Italy kept good relations with the Albanians, especially those in the coastal cities. After the death of Skanderbeg in 1468, a huge amount of the Albanians(mostly from the south) went to Italy to start a new life. Their communities are still existing, keeping the old traditions and speaking in the old Albanian. They are called Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb. This aided more to the cause of Italians sending help to Albania to fight back the Ottomans. After the 1600s, with the riots becoming less frequent, Albania underwent a cruel transformation and isolation through Turkish policies of assimilating the nation, losing all the relations and allies, which lasted until the late 1860s. After the independence, Italy and Albania became once again strategic partners. Why? Because from all the countries in the Balkan coastline, the Albanians were the closest and more similiar to the Italian culture. The Slavic countries and Greeks were too distant for them.During and after the First World War, Albania was in a vulnerable position. For such a small country, the risk of being invaded came from all of the parts of the country. The Serbs in the Northeast, the Greeks in the Southeast, and then Italy in the West. After the Treaty of London, Albania was considered as a cake to be shared piece by peice, even though it was an idependent country. The promised territories of Albania to Italy were treated in Articles 6 and 7 of the treaty:[3] Article 6 Italy shall receive full sovereignty over Valona, the island of Saseno and surrounding territory.... Article 7 Having obtained the Trentino and Istria by Article 4, Dalmatia and the Adriatic islands by Article 5, and also the gulf of Valona, Italy undertakes, in the event a small, autonomous, and neutralized state being formed in Albania Italy not to oppose the possible desire of France, Great Britain, and Russia to repartition the northern and the southern districts of Albania between Montenegro, Serbia, and Greece. The southern coast of Albania, from the frontier of the Italian territory of Valona to Cape Stilos, is to be neutrazied. The Italy will be conceded the right of concluding the foreign relations of Albania; in any case, Italy will be bound to secure for Albania a territory sufficiently extensive to enable its frontiers to join those of Greece and Serbia to the west of Lake Ochrida .. Vlora(Valona) is the closest city to Italy and had a huge risk of being occupied by the sea. In the summer of 1920, Italy decided to strike. They sent around 14000 troops. The Albanians in the North were constantly under heavy fire of the Serbs and in the South the situation was worse with the Greeks, commiting genocide on the ethnic Albanians which were left unarmed. Vlora was soon to fall as being the last stronghold to the inner Albania, resulting in the death of the nation. What followed, was a series of battles that lasted for 2 months(officially 4). First, only 4000 albanians were ready and fought back, but later many others joined them. But still greatly outnumbered and lacking the military force. The war ended in a disaster for the Italians losing a quarter of the army, counting over 3000 of casulties and many of their artillery being destroyed, with the Albanians counting about 500 casualties. The underdogs had humiliated an European superpower. This not only helped to the downfall of the current government at that time in Italy to the hands of the fascists, but also became a revenge-fueled motive for the invasion of Albania in 1939. 4. The economical invasion that led to the territorial one. In the early 20s, Albanian government was rapidly declining. The rise of a man named Ahmet Zog, changed the political scene. Not going much into the details, after a political struggle between him and his rivals, and with the failure of the Republic, Zog announced the Kingdom of Albania and became the absolute monarch of the nation. His country was in ill and grave conditions so he started a series of changes and reformations. The Albania went from a feudal country to a new modern society. This came with an expensive price. With his Yugoslav allies retreating each day from the financial aid, and other european royal families ignoring him because he was self-announced and had no previous ties to the royal scene, King Zog turned his eyes to Italy. Mussolini had long estabilished the fascist state and had helped Zog in his early political career, before him being a king. By the early 30s, Zog had removed all of the British and French chiefs and directors and substituted them with Italian military personnel. In the spring of 1925 two important concessions were signed with Italy; the first was the right to found a national bank and the second was the approval of the establishment of an Italian company (SVEA), to develop the economy of Albania. Later the National Bank of Albani was founded with Italian capital and Italy helped to issue and introduce the official currency of Albania, the Lek. He became famous for loaning a huge amount of gold from the Italian Bank to further improve the country. Many Italians had settled down in Albania. Many cities were constructed by Italian architects with the buildings and facilities being built as the Italian style. Zog was in serious troubles as his loan to Italy was getting huge and he was unable to pay back. This caused Mussolini to strengthen his influence over the Albania. So much influence, that the Albanian National Bank had its seats in Rome. The events of the Great Depression and the bank interest were a motivation for Italy to raise their dominance, but as I mentioned earlier, Mussolini never had an appetite for Albania as much as the other countries such has France. A man named Galeazzo Ciano, entered the scene. He compiled all of the reasons i mentioned to persuade Duce in conquering Albania. As a diplomat and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, his interests over Albania grew high. He was the mastermind of the economical invasion and of course that of 1939. 5. Why wouldn\u2019t they? The communist propaganda later depicted the fascists as monsters. In history books here in Albania, we learn about the heroic stand that a dozens of men gave their life for the country the day of the invasion. On the other side, Italian invaders met zero to little restistance, and that was insignificant. To some reports, the crowds of people welcomed the Italian soldiers with cheers and happy faces. The Albanian Army was no match for them, and all of the higher ranked officers and commanders were Italians. Imagine as if you were a soldier and were sent to fight in a country that is totally different from you, yet you see there people taliking in your language and the buildings are the same way as in your country. After all, Mussolini didn\u2019t give his money and gold for nothing. 6. Securing the Adriatic, the Italians would be ready to launch a strike on Egypt and declare dominance over Mediterrean. The real goal was Greece, because there were many British troops stationed and had a huge risk to attack Italy by the heel of its boot. A war by the sea would be disastrous as they were inferior to the British fleet. Ciano planned that, with Albania cooperating and being a safe zone for their troops, they would enter Greece and attack the Brits, assuming that the Greek forces wouldn\u2019t be a problem to them. The other part of the Balkans were to be controlled by the Nazis. The rest is history, but I would say it is not a difficult situation to figure it out what happened. ",

            "answer_text": "Italy wanted control of Albania's oil In 1918 Italian geologist Dr.Leo Madelena with oil engineer Odoardo Amoretti drilled the first Albanian oil well near Drashovica, discovering huge reserves of oil & natural gas at a mere 200 metres depth (666 ft).  Late in WW1, Italy occupied southern Albania, ostensibly to prevent influence of the Austro Hungarian Empire. because the titular head of Albania openly expressed his loyalty to the German (ie Austro Hungarian) Empire of the First World War. Remembering in WW1 Italy was allied with the British & French against Germany. This role reversed by 1939 when Italy & Germany became allied in their \u201cPact of Steel\u2019 later known as the Tripartite pact, or AXIS pact.  King Zog lst of Albania was born Ahmet Muhtar Zogolli the son, or Prince of a noble chieftain (called a Bey), but he was educated in Turkey. In 1911 upon the death of his father, at age 16, he was appointed chief of Albania\u2019s armed forces and Governor of the Ottoman province of Mat by the Turks. As his education in Turkey wound up Ahmet volunteered to fight for the Austro Hungarians, so he traveled to Vienna. Ahmet was impressed by western society and began to develop ideas about transforming Albania from fudalism to constitutional democracy. Whilst in Vienna he assumed leadership of the Albanian reformist party fighting for independence from the Ottoman Turks raising a guerilla army of 2000 tribal fighters. Thus Ahmet managed to annoy his Turkish benefactors who demanded his arrest from their ally Austria. whom he also managed to embarrass.  Ahmet was quite impressed by western society in Vienna, thus volunteered to fight against Italy for the Austro Hungarians. In rather vague circumstances perhaps at the request of Austria\u2019s ally the Ottoman rulers, Ahmet Muhtar Zogolli was detained under arrest in Vienna. By the end of the War in 1918 Austria handed him over to the victorious Italians who kept him under arrest until 1919. When oil was discovered in Albainia in 1918, the Italians forced Zog to negotiate oil concessions within Albania under duress in return for his release. Once Zog returned he instituted political reforms with a modern constitution booting out Ottoman rule for good. In 1922 he was elected Prime Minister His reforms however were not universally accepted. Corrupt land owners & industrialists who had grown wealthy under Ottoman rule tried to assassinate him. In fact during his lifetime King Zog survived 50 assassination attempts.  King Zog I of Albania, centre, poses with crown prince Vogal Esad, Colonel Saredgzi, General Aranita, General Ghilardi and Colonel Basha. Circa 1930. In 1924, Ahmet was crowned king and appointed chief of the armed forces by a council of chieftains (Bey). However next in 1924 King Zog had to confront a left wing, peasant rebellion Zog had to flee the country with 600 loyal supporters into the arms of neighbouring Serbs who helped him return to power. Eventually Zog tired of placating demands from the Italians and began to court fresh relations with Romania & Serbia Postwar efforts to expand Italy\u2019s military presence in Albania resulted in the Vlores War which was essentially an Albanian uprising that forced Italian forces to quit Albania. in 1920.  With the rise of fascism Mussolini used a tactic which the world has recently seen from Trump v China, essentially racist attacks isolating & blaming other nationalities for Italy\u2019s own economic hardships. Mussolini accused Islamic & Serbian influences in ALBANIA for infecting Italy with Communism. Benito Mussolini, cited fear of the rise of Islam in Albania under Ottoman rule, also historic racial kinship between Italians and Albanians based on direct rule of ports in Albania by Venetians & Ancient Rome, etc as his justification for Italy\u2019s invasion, April 7\u201312, 1939. The British who backed Greece early in WW2 also contested oil discoveries in Albania made in 1928.  Irrespective of Mussolini\u2019s faux justifications for invasions, Italy was desperate for oil. MOST OF THE italian navy\u2019s surface fleet was coal powered and desperately short of coal throughout the war. WITHOUT Albanian oil THE Italian Air Force would have remained grounded. IT IS ironic therefore that Italy\u2019s invasion of Albania caused one of Hitler\u2019s greatest blunders, invading the Balkans ",
