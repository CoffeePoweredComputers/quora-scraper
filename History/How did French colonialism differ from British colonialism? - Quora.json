            "answer_text": "Well, there is a perfect example to make the comparison: Vanuatu [the New Hebrides]. A joint colony, set up in 1899\u20131904, with two administrations, French and British, each under their own Resident Commissioner, that lasted until independence in 1980. The two administrations competed for influence and control over the 70,000 inhabitants across all the islands and villages. They did this by means of [mostly missionary-led] schools, dispensaries, roads, landing stages, communications etc. FRANCE \u2022 Preserve colonial [or discrete post-colonial] rule \u2022 Preserve and expand the use of French language \u2022 Preserve and expand land-holdings by French plantation owners \u2022 Defend Catholicism \u2022 Inclusionism: Encourage native inhabitants to become more like Frenchmen and women. Establish the status of \u2018Assimil\u00e9\u2019 for those who reach a certain level. Teach the history of the Kings Louis of France, and the geology of the Paris Clay Basin. Encourage the brightest pupils to go on to university in France [Bordeaux] \u2022 Encourage intermarriage and interbreeding between locals and the French: French government officials received marriage and childrens\u2019 allowances for their French wives; but also - at about 35\u201340% of that - for their \u201cFemme de campaign\u201d and the children by them. The resultant \u2018M\u00e9tis\u2019 were given preference in government jobs and positions. [NB. This not \u201clong ago and far away\u201d. It was still the case in the 1970s]. BRITAIN \u2022 Prepare and train the people for eventual independence [Lugard Doctrine]. Teach the history of Pacific Island peoples, and the geology of the Pacific \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019. Encourage the brightest pupils to go on to regional universities in Fiji or New Guinea. \u2022 Build the indigenous Consultative Assembly into a Legislative Assembly \u2022 Encourage reversion of expatriated land to native \u2018Custom Rule\u2019. Discourage English-speaking plantation-owners \u2022 Encourage Protestantism, and schooling in Melanesian Pigin [Bislama] or English \u2022 Paternalism: treat the natives - literally - as children. No intermarriage; no sex [Sex with children is paedophilia, so impermissible]. No giving of alcohol to natives. Locals who copied British ways and mannerisms were sometimes mocked and rebuffed. So: take your pick. The British got it all right - except the one thing that really mattered. Vanuatu, after some minor disturbances and violence, became independent in 1980, and is now a largely Bislama- [then English]-speaking and Protestant republic. ",

            "answer_text": "While both the French and the British colonial masters believed they were superior to their colonial subjects, there was a subtle but very significant difference in their attitudes and consequent ways in which they imposed their Will and Culture on the Conquered. The French thought their culture was the best in the world, better than even the British. But they did indeed appreciate certain aspects of other cultures and appreciated the fact that these people are attached to their own cultures. However, they believed that if only their colonial subjects could aspire to, and learned French culture, language, cuisine, fashion, behaviour they could refine themselves enough to be \u201cFrenchified\u201d and thus refined and acceptable and could be assimilated as French to a great extent. British pride was, on the other hand, of the superiority complex kind, that British culture was the highest developed civilisation in the world, so superior that even French culture could not compete, let alone Africans or Indians or Chinese. Other cultures could never aspire to British finesse. With their African subjects they went even further to actually ban any attempts to even learn the English language, or how to read or write. At the same time, they obliterated African culture, language, medicine, arts and religion. The long term effects of these differences between the French and British colonial masters are clearly reflected to this day in the subsequent differences in the Fate of the respective colonial subjects. Francophone Africa, post colonialism, retained (and developed) a lot of their culture, music, language, traditional herbs and medicines. Some members who were educated enough could sit in Parliament in France! Not so their Anglophone counterparts. They were left clutching straws. Admonished from following their culture, yet not assimilated into English culture. In other words, they were left hanging in no-man\u2019s-land. ",
