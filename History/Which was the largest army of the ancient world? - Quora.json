            "answer_text": "Its impossible to tell, but this tibit might help. The Romans believed that a organized army shouldn't be bigger than 50,000 men. Anything larger than that and you start to run into command and logistic problems. No obviously larger armies existed, but usually when you see massive forces in the ancients world they're a horde of lightly armed/armored footmen, basically peasents conscripted to fight. Not only that, you start to run into problems with space. Armies fought in formation, they didn't just mass charge like in the movies. So you need a area that is relatively large and flat, or at least you want that for pitched battle. You want room to maneuver, and more importantly, clear lines of sight for orders to issued through musical signals, or things like flag signals. Now again, there are many instances where you see larger armies, even larger Roman armies, but are they better? Rarely. Two examples, both Roman to keep with the trend. Canne, roughly 80,000 Romans against just under 40,000, like 36,000, Carthaginians. Rome got destroyed, it still stands as one of the greatest tactical victories of all time. I'm simplifying this a lot, there were a lot of reasons that led to the Roman loss, but a big part of it was that Hannibal was able to manuver his smaller, and arguably less trained/effective troops, more effectively while the Romans got bogged down and trapped. A large force almost certainly would have had far more issue with this manuver. Another example is Caesar at Alessia, Caesar was outnumbered 60,000 to 100,000 and he still took the day through far better management of troops. Now Caesars forces were eons ahead of the Gauls in actual combat power, but they were also trapped between the city itself, and the outer force of Gauls which tactically is pretty much a worst case scenario. Also the logistical needs of feeding and supplying 50,000 are frightening, especially in enemy territory. The danger you run of the enemy cutting off your supplies cannot be overstated. So truly massive armies become less likely the longer they supposedly campaigned with that number. Hannibal lost HALF his army crossing the alps, largely for logistical reasons, and a huge Avalanche\u2026 So I know this didn't exactly answer your question, but I hope it helps sort through some of the common misinformation in history.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think one can properly give you an answer. Numbers are easy to manipulate and size of armies is always exadurated to show either huge display of power or to portray courage and valor in case of impossible odds. There are two contestors in my opinion and both for a same reason. Those are Achaemenid Empire and Empire of Alexander the Great.   Both armies financed huge expeditions. They controled armies of all of the known world from Scythians to Egyptians and from Greeks to Indian Elephants. Both Empires empoloyed merceneries, Persians had famous Greek meeceneries lead by Xenophon in a book \u201cMarch of the Ten Thousand\u201d and Alexander had Thracian and Scythian merceneries. Another important factor is they ruled Middle East. It was always one of the most populous parts of the world. Even today we can say it is the centre of the world.  Alexander at Guagamela  Alexander\u2019s army in Indus Valley  March of the Ten Thousand  Xenophon and his soldiers overjoyed at the sight of the sea  Greeks assaulting Persian fortification  Typical Persian formation  Scythians and Persian cavalry fighting  Scythians entering Persian Empire  Persian Immortal, every dead soldier was immidiatly replaced As I said, numbers are very deciving. Keep in mind that this was during warm period or Roman Optimal Climate which is when there is more crops and population is growing more. Keep in mind this applies more to the climate of Hellenistic Period and less to the Persian Empire. Tehnicly speaking Rome under Princeps and Crysis of Third Century had bigger army, but army was disperesed all over the empire frontline so there was no single great expedition like that of Alexander in India. Most of the time, all 3 Empires had aproximatly army of 500 000. That\u2019s the most common number I found and even Wikipedia confirms it.  Position of Roman Legions  Roman fortification near border  Roman army from Third Century to Seventh Century  Graphic showing temperature. Notice second green mark asRoman Optimal Period how warm it was. Empire of Aksum, Sassanid, Parthia and Kush couldn\u2019t compare to Achaemanid, Alexander and Roman Empires due to their size (Aksum), nature (Kushan and Parthia) or resources (Sassanid). I can\u2019t speak of Chinese Empires or Indian Kingdoms and Empires since I don\u2019t know the nature of their army, training and method of maintainance.      ",
