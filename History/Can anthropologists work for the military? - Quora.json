            "answer_text": "They can, and do. We had a graduate student who was a military officer, who earned an M.A. in Anthropology. He had done a few tours in Iraq, if I recall, but that had nothing to do with his academic work. However, he did plan on remaining in the military and using his anthropological knowledge and training. The Human Terrain System (which last I saw, had been shut down) embedded anthropologists with troops on the ground in order to provide them with imformation about local culture, customs, and behavior. So, that\u2019s your answer. Personally, I am against this, and believe than it is unethical for anthropologists to use their knowledge of other cultures against any group of people, for any reason or cause. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but professional ethics elaborated by the American Anthropological Association call on us to strive to \u201cdo no harm,\u201d directly or indirectly, to the people we study; and to be open about what we are up to, avoiding \u201csecret or clandestine\u201d manipulative activities. Frankly, these ethical imperatives make many of us skeptical about the appropriateness, for anthropologists, of joining the military. Ultimately, however, the individual anthropologist must decide.

I would consider getting a masters degree, if you don\u2019t already have one. This will definitely make you stand out. ",
