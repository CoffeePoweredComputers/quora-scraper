            "answer_text": "It depends\u2026 As a whole, considered positive but not anymore than that. Unfortunately, Japan and Christianity has a pretty sordid history. Christian missionaries find Japan a tough nut to crack | The Japan Times The Portuguese missionaries who brought Bibles also brought merchants with guns. So most Japanese perceive at the very least, cautiousness that thinks there is a darker motive for the kindness and service that most Christians use to proselytize. Add to the fact that traditional Evangelical Christianity made popular after WWII made it clear if are associating with non-Christians without the intent to convert a sin. Since Japanese people value relationships more than religious beliefs (or the importance of relationships is the core cultural belief of Japanese people), any religion that claimed that ancestor worship, going to Shinto shrines/Buddhist temples even for family gatherings, having religious charms from non-Christian sources, etc. was bad\u2026well, it would put a lot of strain in relationships. Thus you have this strange dilemma where the people who can accept Christianity were people who were generally outcasts of some sort with anti-social behavior who didn\u2019t mind cutting off relationships (which would chase out any \u201cnormal Japanese\u201d people) OR you have a church where it is generally accepted that you make \u201cgive unto Caesar what Caesar is due\u201d and still pay lip service and actively participate in non-Christian, Japanese cultural activities (thus making them culturally indistinguishable and hard to explain why they are different than others). So in general, you\u2019re looking at a group of people who for most Japanese: are unaware they exist (because those who are devoted are not openly proselyting)are thought of as a bunch of brainwashed weirdos",

            "answer_text": "Living in Japan over four years with a traditional Japanese family, as far as I can see, they generally don\u2019t care about other religions. Shinto and Buddhism are embedded in their genetic make up. In words, Shinto and Buddhism are more than a religion for them but rather part of their identity. How do Japanese think about Christianity? What I can see during my stay in Japan, they like the Christian culture. They enjoy and celebrate Christian events, the Christmas, Halloween, and so forth. However, they don\u2019t really know deeply know the pillars of Christianity. They just like the representation of Christianity as religion/culture in Hollywood movies. In this sense, it is fair to say that Christianity has a positive image in the mind of Japanese in comparison to other religions, such as Islam or Judaism. Islam is connected with terrorism in Japan while Judaism is linked with Palestine war. I hope the above gives you a general idea about how Japanese think about religions! ",
