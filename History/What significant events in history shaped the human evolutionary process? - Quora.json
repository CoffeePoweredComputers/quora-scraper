I can either tell you about it or show it to you. Both will also work. Covid19. 71,000 infected in USA today. The launch into the infinity is soon at our own private doors. The telling of the most enlightened ones explain the merciful slowing of covid19 could slow just by using MASKS. Significant event. The mind exists before the before existed and after the after could ever reach to. Still the OH YET, the answer is there so simple and sweet. watch this one thing first.  i must add a few topics but i do not delete the topic because i do know how to hint a friend to a friend and \u201cso on and so on and so on\u201d . At your command. This is what created and bonds the humanity of here past and future. From Gee Gee Prime to Desert Planet, The new Dune is coming. We simplay at taking the desert out of the planet earth but consider that word well. ",

All humans are related to mitochondrial Eve. There was a genetic constriction about 70,000 years ago, we all are related to about 2000 people who survived (possible supervolcano). Domestication and agriculture, eventually sanitation, vaccines, petroleum, caused a massive increase in the number of people, we're now heading to 10bn by 2050. We're also headed for inevitable extinction, by 2100. It will be the best documented extinction in the entire universe. Don't have kids. ",

Another would have been, when these organisms crawled out of the ocean. There are so many though, Australopithecus man. He was believed to be the first upright. And so many other events. Let us not forget the understanding a problematic microbes combating them with things like penicillin. This allowed us to live longer. And much earlier than that learning that cooked meat was better for us then raw meat during man's early stages. And of course eradication of diseases throughout time as we've advanced. Really quite impressive our evolutionary process. ",

            "answer_text": "It is difficult, if not impossible, to pin the evolutionary process down to one or more specific events, but an important one that comes to mind is the mutation in the FOXP2 gene which, among other things, plays a key role in the development of the ability for speech in H. sapiens. If memory serves me right, this gene is 304 characters long, and differs in only 3 (or 4) characters (2 amino acids) from its counterpart in chimpanzees. ",
