            "answer_text": "No. The design yield was 150 megatons. The Soviets derated it to 50 megatons. The actual yield was 57 megatons. The Soviets took a good look at the test site and decided to never, ever, do that again. Besides, much of the effect was wasted, escaping into space. No-one built bombs bigger than about 5 megaton after that, and most bombs were a megaton or less. As one to 5 megaton bombs were excellent city-killers, there wasn\u2019t a use case for 50+ megaton weapons. Besides, it was just too damn big. It couldn\u2019t be flown on a missile, and putting it on a bomber cut the range, and it wasn\u2019t as if Soviet bombers had the range to reach most of the US in the first place. Unless the launched from Cuba, that is. Which is why there was a Nike SAM site in the swamp a few miles from Miami, and some of the Nike Hercules missiles at the site had W31 nuclear warheads. Nike Hercules missiles were SAMs, but had the range to reach Havana and points further east. The US made damn sure that Fidel knew that the Nikes would be going for intercept as far away from American territory as possible, so if there was even a hint of the possibility of bombers big enough to carry big nukes launching from Cuba, ol\u2019 Cigar Guy had best prepare for inbound nukes. Lots of them. In addition to the Nike base, several airbases in Florida were home or temporary bases for F-102 and F-106 interceptors. The typical warload for a F-102 or -106 was three or two IR-guided Falcan missiles, two or three RADAR guided Falcons, for a total of five Falcons in whatever mix\u2026 and a Genie nuclear-armed rocket. The fighters were to launch the Genie at a bomber formation, or at an airbase if they could catch the bombers on the ground, and then follow up with the Falcons. And then go home, as F-102 and -106s didn\u2019t have guns. Not only would nuke Nikes be raining down, so would Genies. Fidel declined to allow western Cuba be turned into an irradiated mess. The Soviets didn\u2019t build more or bigger bombs because they didn\u2019t need them and couldn\u2019t deliver them anyway. ",
