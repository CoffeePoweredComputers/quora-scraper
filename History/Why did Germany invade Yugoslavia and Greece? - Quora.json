            "answer_text": "Hitler, and Nazi doctrine dictated Slavs were inferior to the \u201cGerman race.\u201d The Nazi plan was for the \u201cGerman race\u201d to essentially own Europe/the world due to their \u201cnatural strength and aptitude for dominance.\u201d The Slavs were deemed to be the enslaved race required to make Nazi Europe function. While the blond and blue eyes Aryan race was to enjoy the pleasures of life, the brown haired and brown eyed Slavs were to serve the Aryan Germans. Although an exception was to be made for Ukrainians due to the whole blond hair, blue eyed thing. Hitler was getting Yugoslavia ready for when the time came to garden Slaves. This animosity of the Slavs most likely came from his own experiences with Poland and losing to the Russians. We all know that the belief for Jewish people was extermination no matter what. Some would work, but meaningless work, and unto death, but extermination no matter what. The Slavs were not on the sake token as the Jews, the Slavs were deemed, I don\u2019t even know what\u2019d you\u2019d call it, \u201cworthy\u201d, to be the work force, also unto death, but at least they would serve in people\u2019s homes, and essentially do all the dirty work needed for a society to function. As for the Greeks, Hitler had a respect for ancient cultures, but had a dislike towards both Italy and Greece at the end of the day, due to their history of homosexuality. He believed they bred weaker men, and in the Nazi hierarchy, anything weak needed to be dominated (by Germany). And while he didn\u2019t believe Greeks were to serve in bondage the way Slavs would, he believed Greece needed to be put in its place below Germany nonetheless. Literally, Nazi beliefs and plans for Europe could be its own subject. ",

            "answer_text": "Invasion of Yugoslavia - Part of the Serbian monarchy at the time were pressured by Germany and Croatian separatists to sign the Tripartite Pact which would effectively make Yugoslavia an ally of the Axis powers. Many serb nationalists, especially within the military rightly saw this as a prelude to the forced disintegration or break up of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. When this Treaty was signed by the current regent \u201cPrince Paul\u201d (in 1941 i think, not sure), a military coup took place which deposed Paul and consequently led to Germany\u2019s military intervention. Invasion of Greece - This follows the invasion of Yugoslavia and the failure of Germany\u2019s ally, the poorly led and equipped Italian army, to invade and occupy Greece. Also a good chunk of the greek population had communist sympathies but mostly it was to secure Germany\u2019s Balkan flank against British and free French held territories in the mediterranean and Africa (Cyprus, Malta, Egypt, Free French Equatorial and Western Africa etc\u2026).
