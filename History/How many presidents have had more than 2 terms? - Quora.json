The constitution was amended during Truman\u2019s term so that Presidents can serve a maximum of ten years. Truman was grandfathered in, so could have run for a third term, but decided not to. Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford could, theoretically, have served more than two terms. Johnson served 14 months after a Kennedy was killed, and then served a four year term. He decided not to run again. Ford serve a little under two years when Nixon resigned, making him eligible to run for two more terms. However, he lost to Jimmy Carter. Teddy Roosevelt tried.

Roosevelt didn\u2019t like the job he was doing, so ran against Taft as a third party candidate. Taft and Roosevelt split the a Republican vote, and Wilson was elected. ",
