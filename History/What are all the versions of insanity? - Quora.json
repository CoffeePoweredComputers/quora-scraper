            "answer_text": "The term \u201cinsanity\u201d is pretty outdated. The only context it is still used is \u201cinnocent by reason of insanity\u201d, which means that the person was in such a disturbed mental state that they either could not realize they were committing a crime or understand that what they were doing was wrong. When someone goes \u201cpure crazy\u201d, I assume you mean when someone has a psychotic break, meaning a break with reality where they cannot tell the difference between what is real and what is hallucination/delusion. Hallucinations can be visual, auditory, smells, tastes and sensations. Delusions can include thoughts of persecution, grandiose, thinking that the TV or radio is talking to you, Religious, thought insertion or broadcasting, etc. These symptoms can manifest in a variety of mental illnesses. As for the other kinds of mental illness, there is a 900+ page book called the DSM-5, that lists all of the diagnoses, their symptoms/diagnostic criteria and other pertinent facts. It would be impossible to list them all here. They include psychotic illnesses such as Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder; Mood Disorders such as Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder; Anxiety Disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Trauma Disorders like Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Personality Disorders such as Antisocial Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder and Narcissistic Personality Disorder. But these are just the more familiar ones. I have run across Schizoid Personality Disorder, Encopresis, Adjustment Disorder and several clients that have claimed to have Dissociative Identity Disorder (previously Multiple Personality Disorder). If you are really interested in the multitude of fascinating ways that the brain can manifest dysfunction, check out the DSM-5 in your local library or just look up DSM-5 diagnoses online. It\u2019s an interesting read! ",
