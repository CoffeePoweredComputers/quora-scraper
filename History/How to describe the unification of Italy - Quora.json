            "answer_text": "The failure of revolutionary uprisings both in 1831 and 1848 meant that the mantle now fell on Sardinia-Piedmont under its ruler, King Victor Emmanuel II, to unify the Italian states through war. Chief Minister Cavour who led the movement to unify the regions of Italy was neither a revolutionary nor a democrat. By a tactful diplomatic alliance with France engineered by Cavour, Sardinia-Piedmont succeeded in defeating the Austrian forces in 1859. Regular troops and a large number of armed volunteers under the leadership of Garibaldi joined the fray. In 1860, they marched into South Italy and the Kingdom of the two Sicilies and succeeded in winning the support of the local peasants in order to drive out the Spanish rulers. In 1861 Victor Emmanuel II was proclaimed the king of United Italy. In 1867, Garibaldi led an army of volunteers to fight the Papal states where a French garrison was stationed but he was defeated. It was only in 1870 that Papal states joined Italy. ",
