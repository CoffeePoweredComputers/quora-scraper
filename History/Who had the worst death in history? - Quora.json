            "answer_text": "I can only think of one person. George strinney   George Stinney Jr became the youngest person to be executed in the US in the 20th century when he was sent to the electric chair in 1944. Two young white girls had been found brutally murdered, beaten over the head with a railroad spike and dumped in a water-logged ditch. He and his little sister, who were black, were said to be last ones to see them alive. Authorities later released the older Stinney \u2013 and directed their attention toward George. March 1944, deep in the Jim Crow South, police came for 14-year-old George Stinney Jr. His parents weren't at home. He was questioned in a small room, alone \u2013 without his parents, without an attorney. ( the landmark Supreme Court case guaranteeing the right to counsel, wouldn\u2019t be decided until 1963.) Police claimed the boy confessed to killing Betty June Binnicker, 11, and Mary Emma Thames, 8, admitting he wanted to have sex with Betty. They rushed him to trial.The boy denied the charges. \u201cI didn\u2019t, didn\u2019t do it,\u201d . He said, \u2018Why would they kill me for something I didn\u2019t do?\u2019 \u201d But he didn't know that they weren't even interested to know his side of story. After a two-hour trial and a 10-minute jury deliberation, Stinney was convicted of murder on April 24 and sentenced to die by electrocution, according to a book by Mark R. Jones. Stinney was barely 5 feet tall and not yet 100 pounds. The electric chair\u2019s straps were too big for his frail body. Newspapers at the time reported he had to sit on books to reach the headpiece. And when the switch was flipped, the convulsions knocked down the large mask, exposing his tearful face to the crowd. I can't even imagine the horror he felt in that moment. He wasn't given a fair chance to defend himself and even then nothing would have changed as they already marked him guilty.  The trial was nothing but unfair and unjust towards that boy. . . .

            "answer_text": "EDIT: I've been asked to include a warning: some may find this answer very distressing. Read ahead at your own discretion. I've tried to describe the death as factually and unemotionally as possible, but it's still horrific. I\u2019d nominate Junko Furuta.  Image source: Japanese Horror Story: The Torture of Junko Furuta Junko Furuta was a Japanese schoolgirl who suffered 40 days of unimaginable torture at the hands of her classmates before dying on January 4th, 1989. After she rejected the school bully, Hiroshi Miyano, she was taken by 4 boys to the home of one of the kidnappers, Nobaharu Minato. All in all, over 100 people knew of her abduction; none did anything to help, and several joined in the torture. According to their statements in court, the four boys tortured Junko relentlessly, to such an extent that her face was so swollen she was virtually unrecognisable, she lost bladder control (and was beaten for wetting the carpet), and her body developed a rotting smell. The torture included: Rape \u2014 Junko was raped over 400 times over the course of 40 days. Many of these rapes were gang-rape, and the four boys\u2019 friends were invited to join in and humiliate her. Over 100 different men are alleged to have participated in rape at some point. She was naked for most of her imprisonment and forced to masturbate in front of her captors. Some of the boys urinated on her, and she was forced to drink her own urine.Vaginal mutilation \u2014 iron bars, scissors, needles, skewers, a bulb, fireworks, cigarettes and lighters amongst other foreign objects were forced into her vagina and anus, causing severe burning and damage. Additionally, she forcibly had her breasts pierced with sewing needles and one of her nipples was torn off.Beatings \u2014 she was beaten regularly, and sometimes strapped up as a human punching bag. The boys used clubs, rods and bamboo sticks to punish her for displeasing them.Freezing \u2014 after pleading to die, she was locked outside overnight (bear in mind this was in winter), and later locked in a freezer.Burning \u2014 this is believed to be the ultimate cause of her death. She suffered severe burns from the aforementioned lighters and fireworks. When she tried to call the police, she was doused in lighter fluid and her body was set on fire. Somehow she survived, but was killed by another body fire on the 40th day of imprisonment.The boys reportedly dropped barbells and an iron exercise ball on her stomach, which was partly responsible for the lost bladder control, along with the damage to her genitals.Hiroshi was sentenced for 20 years, and the other main captors received 5\u201310 years each. Most of them were subsequently arrested again for various crimes, including rape and fraud. They were aged 17\u201318 at the time; Junko was 17. Had the captors been slightly older, they almost certainly would have received life imprisonment or the death penalty. The case is considered controversial due to their lenient sentences, and I can see why. ",
