            "answer_text": "Biggest difference in ideology or practices I\u2019ve ever been able to identify was that people continue to pretend that there *is* a difference despite a total lack of evidence. Hitler lifted entire passages from Karl Marx\u2019s communist manifesto for Mein Kampf, and he enacted nearly every single social program the Soviet Union did, right down to creating collective farms and nationalizing most of the corporations existing in Nazi occupied territory. For the record, Hitler also killed off most of the pre-existing Nazi party during his rise to power and replaced many key personnel in it with \u201cformer\u201d GErman communists, and Hitler himself had a pre-existing association with at least one prominent German communist terrorist group (which was kind of how he ended up imprisoned; he quite literally tried, and failed to assassinate the Weimar Republic\u2019s government dressed in a tuxedo and his old helmet. In fact it was western socialists as well as the Soviet Union that effectively pressured the Weimar Republic to free him.) But I mean sure, we could look at policies, effects of actions, the writings of the people central to both party\u2019s leadership pre and post ascent to power, and that\u2019d turn up a stunning degree of ideological and even doctrinal commonality (the Soviet Union was murdering Jews, Gypsies, the elderly, and the handicapped on a mass scale long before Hitler did it, for example.) We could even point out in Hitler and Stalin\u2019s own writings where they *both* comment on the extreme similarities in ideology they had. As well as that of qualified outside observers. But it still won\u2019t kill the myth they were somehow polar opposites, simply because if the average voter in any free nation knew how much in common every totalitarian ideology of the late 18th century onwards has (IE, they were all socialist states) they\u2019d never be able to secure a seat as town dogcatcher, much less anything else again.

            "answer_text": "No. The Communist end goal was to make all the people around the world happy. The Nazi end goal was to make only Aryans happy while keeping Slavs (for example) as oppressed slaves. Also, because Nazi theories were based on the theory of tainted/wrong blood, they necessitated the eradication of all the \u201cwrong\u201d people, including kids and babies. While the Soviet policies led to a lot of children suffering and even death, they never necessitated the mass execution of children (and women, to some degree). Because of that, a lot of descendants of repressed Soviet people survived and prospered in the late Soviet Union. Famously, both President Gorbachev and President Yeltsin had repressed direct ancestors. By the way, those ancestors survived the repressions (they were imprisoned, not executed). And that wasn\u2019t unique. On the other hand, it\u2019s hard to imagine a Nazi leader of Nazi Germany whose Jewish father survived the death camp. Death camps were created to eliminate people, not to release them after several years of punishment. ",
