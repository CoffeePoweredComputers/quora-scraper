            "answer_text": "In most US colleges and universities archaeology is treated as a subdiscipline of anthropology. Lewis Binford was famously know to assert that \u201carchaeology is anthropology, or it is nothing.\u201d This is largely because in the US, Native peoples were the chief focus of anthropology and the prehistory of native peoples was an essential element in understanding them. The idea that they had been out of cultural contact with the Old World was regarded as an ideal means of understanding \u201claws\u201d of cultural evolution. For example in both the Old and New Worlds plants were domesticated and became staple foods. Monumental architecture appeared in societies with excess production capacity and population. Writing was invented and so was the zero. The independence of Native American cultural evolution has been questioned but no unequivocal evidence of influential contact with the Old World has ever been adduced archaeologically. There are historical observations of Japanese fishermen living among Northwest Coast societies. But the evidence of actual transference of cultural elements is missing as far as I know. The reality is that archaeological methods are not anthropological. They are closer to paleontology and very detail oriented empirical field sciences like geology. Archaeological results are minimally anthropological but regionally can be related to historical and classical issues. So archaeology is also associated with art history, Classics (Rome, Greece, Egypt, etc.), and religious studies (an incredibly political quagmire). ",

            "answer_text": "The way archaeology is taught in North America, it *is* anthropology. An anthropologist is someone who studies humans, the decisions they make and the ways that they live their lives. There are four \u201cfields\u201d of Americanism anthropology: Cultural (observing living cultures and groups) Linguistic (studying the ways people use language, and how we both shape and are shaped by language) Biological (the evolution of humans and how our existence as biological beings shapes who we are- ties neatly with cultural, in that culture is about all the ways that we are so much more than what biology makes us) and archaeology. archaeology, the way I and many other professional and academic archaeologists practice it, is not about studying bones, stones, or bits of pottery. It\u2019s about studying people, often people who no longer exist in the same form they did when they left behind those traces, and how the things people create and make and alter in the world around them can teach us about their lives. Depending on the interests of the archaeologist and the project , this can be something as clear as figuring out what people were eating based on remains of plants and animals, and as complex as examining ceramic styles and house sizes to compare the social structure of different cultures or groups. As Louis Binford put it (and Willey and Phillips before him, if I remember correctly) \u201c\u201cArchaeology is anthropology or it is nothing\u201d ",
