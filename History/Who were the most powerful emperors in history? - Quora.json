            "answer_text": "First, as the question referred specifically to emperors, individuals who were not emperors such as the Spanish conquistadors, the Islamic caliphs until the Ottoman Empire, Hitler, Hannibal, or rulers of the various Communist countries should not be on the list. Pre-Columbian rulers in the Americas should also be left off the list, since the entire population of the Americas prior to Columbus probably never exceeded 10 percent of total world population, and the most extensive pre-Columbian ruler controlled a small fraction of the population of the Americas. In addition to the individuals mentioned, the Roman emperors from Augustus to Nero merit inclusion. The Ottoman sultans from 1521 until the defeat by the Russians in 1783 also should appear on the list. The Japanese emperor Hirohito ruled a gigantic empire in terms of size, population ruled, and comparative military power from the capture of Singapore in early 1942 until the defeat at Tarawa in late 1943. Hirohito was not an absolute ruler, but was not powerless like a British king in the 19th or 20th Centuries. Finally, the rulers of the Empire of Mali during the 14th Century should also be on the list, although there is great difficulty having any reasonable knowledge of how many subjects they ruled. ",
