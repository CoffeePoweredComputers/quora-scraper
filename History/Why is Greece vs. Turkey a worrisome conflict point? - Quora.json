            "answer_text": "There is no Greece versus Turkey. It\u2019s sultan vs neighbors and conflict point is a sultan\u2019s decision while knowing his triple face it is worrisome by all including logical thinking Turks. Greece is pro negotiating the sea trading zones concerned and in case of not reaching a solution the international courts should be allowed to decide. The sultan speak of neo-Ottoman Empire Turkish style by leading the Muslim world, refresh Agreements and examine everything concerning internal Greek affairs(in succeeding to extend further to the rest of neighbors) at wish without allowing international assistance, otherwise he points to his weapons that moves around as a pressure point. At the same time he is upset throwing accusations to all around, knowing that against France and Greece his Turkish and Muslim mercenary army is a sitting duck and luckily allied Germany keeps protecting Turkey of financial measures but for how long. Turkey is a great country that should have had a much higher status around rather than be concerned only with warfare with its economy deteriorating rapidly. ",

            "answer_text": "The Greece - Turkey conflict would be worrisome depending on ones interests and geographic locations. For example the petroleum supply of countries in the east of suez will not be affected, their exports to Europe, which is main market for consumptions will be affected. The petroleum supply of the countries west of suez may get affected as well as if war breaks out then the shipping in Mediterranean area will be adversely affected. So when two sick men are fighting they are really going to harm themselves more than others. But armed conflict has very remote chance as both are NATO members and USA & its European allies will do everything to keep status quo. For the countries who are politically far away from Mediterranean region, not much cause of worry. ",
