            "answer_text": "For a start, Everyone did it, including your ancestors, no matter where you come from. Mongol armies did not decimate civilians along with their soldiers for no reason. One must understand that all of Mongol invasions were induced by the so called victims from the start. It is historical fact, Mongol Empire always sent out emissaries and preferred the diplomatic way first. So much so that the first diplomatically ratified borderline in history is what you know today as the Great Wall of China, which was agreed between Hunnu Empire (Mongols) and the Chinese. Mongols were also VERY BIG on trade missions especially. Chinese laughed at peace treaty first and denied recognition of Mongol sovereign state and its territorial integrity later.Persians and Middle Easterners tortured and beheaded not one but 3 (THREE) diplomatic/trade missions. The heads of emissaries came back, bodies never came back.Russians also executed the emissaries and diplomats for no apparent reason.Emissaries and diplomatic missions were always considered to be under the direct protectorate of the Khan and his empire. This through Mongol Empire would spread throughout the world to what we know today as Diplomatic Immunity. So the torture and death of these missions were direct attacks at the Khan and the Empire. Something that demands response from the Empire. So it did. Tell me why should one spare your civilians if even normal missionaries are horrendously tortured and beheaded by you? So the theme of blood revenge runs deep in these conquests. It\u2019s not like, one shiny day some Khan woke up and decided to conquer someone for no reason. Just as popular culture depicts it today.  Yet still once the Mongol armies reached the enemy cities and settlements. They always gave a chance for the people to surrender. Don\u2019t get me wrong those Kings and their immediate families were always going to die a horrible death. But Civilians were another matter. The Empire never really had anything against them, racially, theologically or otherwise. No one would be harmed as long as the justice would be done on the responsible and the population surrendered to Mongol overlords. There is one small thing that I have to underline here. Mongol civilians always chose if they wanted to support Khan or a General or whoever. If they did not support someone, they just got up and left the camp of the Khan in the middle of the night. For example, after death of Temujins (Chinggis Khan) father, many of his followers simply got up and left. Leaving Chinggis Khan at young age at the mercy of others. This was normal in Mongol Society at that time. While considered cowardly and harshly punished still there was always an option. Option that many took. So Mongols always saw people staying and not fleeing as defacto proclamation of their loyalty to their Kings and etc\u2026 Thus, so called \u201cCivilians\u201d basically became enemy combatants and support units in the eyes of the Mongols.  This is widely known case. From which you can make your own judgements. Death of Al-Musta'sim the coward. So he is recorded in our history. Records show that Mongol general (not even khan) offered to spare the Baghdad along with the treasures if only the caliph would surrender and submit. It was denied. Then, the caliph realized he was going to die. And tried to negotiate the surrender of the city if only he, his inner circle and some of the elite should not get touched. People and their welfare did not matter. This time Mongols denied this cowardly proposal. So, the caliph locked and hid until the Mongols armies came and locked him in his own treasury. Following conversation is widely known. At least in Mongolia. Mongol Khan locked the caliph and his family amidst vast riches, gems and gold to live out his days.caliph asked how he would eat gold, drink silver?Khan asked in return, why would he hide among his riches and palaces while his people suffered for his arrogance? Why would he not give all these riches to save his own people and realm?No answer followed.The travels of Marco polo reports that upon finding the caliph's great stores of treasure which could have been spent on the defense of his realm and people, Hulagu Khan locked him in his treasure room without food or water, telling him \"eat of thy treasure as much as thou wilt, since thou art so fond of it. I do not imagine that the Mongols would have thought highly of people who would support such an coward, who did propose to sell out his realm and his people for safety of his own skin. ",

            "answer_text": "As another person mentions one reason is that this sort of thing happened everywhere. I can\u2019t name a place in history where such things did not happen. I mean this stuff has happened even in tribal societies. That doesn\u2019t make it a good thing, but what I don\u2019t understand is people seem to just dismiss the Mongols as barbarians and that is supposedly why they killed so many people. Leaving out the fact that they treated cities that surrendered without a fight quite well so well that they benefited from being part of the empire because of trade. Plus they were allowed to self-govern as long as they recognized the Khan as their overlord. In Medieval Europe there was a similar rule, if you surrender without a fight the town will be spared, if the city has to be taken without much resistance but you didn\u2019t surrender then expect to be treated poorly, but by no means would the town be looted and burned. However.. if you put up a fight and inflict casualties on the besieging foe, you should expect to have your town looted and burned. This didn\u2019t always happen, but as mentioned this was pretty much how things went everywhere in the world. People also broke the rules sometimes or tricked others.. Because that is what humans do. Some will point to the fact that the Mongols believed it was heavens will to rule the world. A similar thing to the mandate of heaven in China. Well guess what? Christians had similar beliefs too. Why do you think they conquered and converted all over the place? I recently read a text from Caesar Zeno Augustus called the Henoticon, letter issued a Byzantine emperor to his subjects of Egypt and some of the things he said actually have a shocking resemblance and in some ways I\u2019d argue his ideas are a bit more brutal than the Mongols. He LITERALLY says (paraphrasing) that it is his duty to unite all religious doctrines into one, and to conquer and forcefully convert people to please god so that the people prosper. In other words, it is gods will to force everyone to worship him and the emperor is one of his servants or that is at least what he saw himself as. Please do tell me how this is somehow more morally sound than the Mongols.. What do you think he would do if he had the power of a massive empire? Hate the Mongol religious practices all you want but at least they didn\u2019t forcefully convert people like Christians did. I hate almost all religious practices so I get it but as an atheist I don\u2019t understand why people think Christian morality is somehow superior. In fact, moving on to Islam do you want to know what the word Islam actually means? It literally means \u201csubmission\u201d which should be very telling. Like their other counter parts in Europe and Asia they forced people to submit to their rule because their interpretation of god was somehow better than everyone elses. Christians were treated okish in some cases but eventually they were basically forced to convert in many places. As for pagans oh boy.. they were treated horribly because Christianity was seen as an ill-informed version of Islam (at least early in the first caliphate, later treatment of Christians would vary) but Paganism is totally different. Anyway I went on a tangent about religion but I think that is important to point out. What people also don\u2019t realize is that sieging a settlement even for the Mongols wasn\u2019t always an easy task. In fact sieging is always a time consuming affair and you will take losses in some cases heavy losses if you end up assaulting the settlement. Chinese siege technology which enabled them to project fire with their artillery, primitive gunpowder weapons, and specialized siege ladders among other things meant they were masters of siege warfare, but sieging still wasn\u2019t exactly easy, in fact the Mongols certainly weren\u2019t masters of siege warfare early on having to use unconventional tactics. People who say the Mongol\u2019s actions are immoral are not wrong exactly, but I also doubt anyone who has commented on their actions have been in a combat situation like this. I haven\u2019t either so I won\u2019t claim to know all of the ins and outs but there is a phenomenon where if men are angry enough from having to siege a settlement, they get into a fit of rage. Its a certain type of PTSD where you go berserk if you will. (no this is not why certain Viking warriors were called berserkers but that is a topic for another answer) This means they will take their anger out of the people they are besieging. And as mentioned, this happens pretty much everywhere because guess what? We are all human. I am not saying this is a moral thing to do, but you have to understand the context of the situation. In a world where death is more common, where killing civilians is more common, you can imagine that men who are enraged are far more likely to inflict harm. In fact even in World War II this sort of thing happened particularly when the Soviets invaded Germany. In the case of many historical battles, the person leading the army has no control over the men. Think about it, what can one man do when so many have decided to loot the city? Nothing. The Mongols also burned and massacred people because they kind of had to. For two reasons. The first is the Mongols always threatened cities with extermination if they didn\u2019t surrender without a fight. (Killing envoys was also a universal act of war and aggression and because of the Mongol golden rule this was an equally terrible offence) What do you think would happen if the Mongols didn\u2019t follow through? Nobody would surrender because they would have nothing to lose by fighting the Mongols. On the other hand the Mongols couldn\u2019t be too brutal. An empire that is pure evil can\u2019t survive. So the Mongols were also in many ways very generous to those who surrendered. So it was strategically advantageous to take so many lives. It was also advantageous because it meant they didn\u2019t have to leave a garrison at said city. The Mongol empire was too spread out to allow for every single city to get its own garrison. And despite the fact that the Mongols did conquer so much, they still did have to rely on foreigners to fill in the gaps. Imagine how bad the situation would be if they garrisoned everything with Mongols? Their forces would be spread out too thin and revolting against Mongol rule would be easy. The Mongols may have been evil to some extent by modern standards but we can\u2019t judge people purely based on modern morality. Sure, conquering and building an empire can\u2019t be done without inflicting some evil, but it isn\u2019t like the Mongols made life miserable for every person because they felt like it in fact Asia experienced a period of prosperity under their rule. I am not saying that it is a good thing to slaughter innocent people in a city especially people who haven\u2019t wronged you but the context of the situation was such that it was the most advantageous thing to do, and it was a fairly normal thing in the medieval world. The Mongols played dirty sure, sometimes they gave false promises to let their enemies guard down so they could slaughter them like Subutai famously did in Russia. The difference is the Mongols were just better at playing dirty than most. Sorry for the bolded letters but I don\u2019t feel like dealing with people who won\u2019t read the answer so I am going to make it as clear as possible that I am not saying the Mongols were good people. I am saying its a nuanced topic and that the Mongols wouldn\u2019t have been successful if they were pure evil. ",
