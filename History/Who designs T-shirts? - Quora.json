            "answer_text": "Here is a right-brained answer to this question... As you might or might not know, anyone including professional and amateur graphic designers as well as textile designers, can design t-shirts. There are also online companies that will take your design and print it on any number of t-shirts for you. The question here is: what do you base your design on? Can t-shirt designs help promote a website or brand?  Humor me a moment; even though I am a free spirit and prefer to drift through life, not taking life too seriously, I still need to earn an income; to fund my travels.  This is where the t-shirt design part comes in. By creating a fresh and funky design of your business's website and printing it on a t-shirt, you can attract new visitors to your website. A well-designed t-shirt will attract more leads to your website thus, increasing your website\u2019s conversation rate. Everyone loves a well-designed and well-manufactured t-shirt. I believe that there is no better way to advertise your brand. It adds to the \"wow\" factor of the brand. The more people that wear t-shirts with your brand on, the more visitors you are likely to have to your website.  If I see an amazing t-shirt, the first thing I do is go and look up the brand on the internet, and if the website advertises something I like or need, I am an instant convert.  ",
