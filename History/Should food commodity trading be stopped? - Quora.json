            "answer_text": "Mostly no. The commodities market is working in interesting ways to solve famine and make sure all have enough to eat. At the same time, it does not create inflation in the long run. Since commodities futures contracts are dealing with prices in the future, the self-interest of traders is to discover a potential famine early and bid up the prices before that happens. A higher price, when appearing early, does 2 things:  1. Reduce consumption and waste2. Increase production If the majority of traders believe a famine is coming and the prices are bid up higher, the ones who don't will suffer losses. Very likely, the market prices will be high enough to avoid a famine.  On the other hand, a high speculative interest in agricultural commodities does not push up their prices in the long run. That's mostly because it is the self-interest of the farmers to take advantage of the high prices the traders give them at the futures market. When everybody is full and there is much supply left, the traders who would carry the leftover normally wants to be compensated for tying up their cash, paying for storage and insurance, which are expensive. Therefore, at the end of the day, the prices fall to a place where the supply-demand situation is more balanced.  Due to a well-functioning capital market, the farmers have an incentive to increase their efficiency to reap the most gain, and as the efficiency increases faster than the size of bellies, the long-term real prices of grains decrease.
