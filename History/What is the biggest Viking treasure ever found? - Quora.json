The story says: When the tenant *) /cotter (Norwegian; husmann) Halvor found hundreds of years of old Viking gold in the marsh, the finder\u2019s fee was so large that it had to be paid during two years, in order to not ruin the government budget. *) Definition from Merriam-Webster:Tenant: one who has the occupation or temporary possession of lands or tenements of another; specifically : one who rents or leases a dwelling (such as a house) from a landlord.  I wasn\u2019t able to find absolute confirmation that this treasure of gold found in Norway in 1834, really is the biggest Viking treasure ever found. But if should be a good candidate. I translated the article provided below from Norwegian via Google. I did my best to correct the English text when reading through it. At the bottom of this answer I post the original article, where links to sources of photos and articles used by the journalist are listed. The article was written by journalist Ingvild-Anita Velde K\u00f8sling the 31th March 2019. I found the article on the NRK Buskerud web site.  ON THE SHOVEL SUDDENLY HUNG A RING OF GOLD When the tenant Halvor found hundreds of years of old Viking gold in the marsh, the finder\u2019s fee was so large that it had to be distributed over two government budgets. It is a morning like every other morning for those who live a hardworking life. We write August 12, 1834. From a marsh on the large farm Nedre Hoen in Hokksund (Norway), the steady sound of a shovel being stuck in soft soil, is heard time and time again. The tenant Halvor from Heddal is hired to drain the marsh. The job is almost done. It's just the finishing touches Halvor does this morning. Suddenly he discovers that something is hanging on the shovel. It is a huge necklace in gold, solid and heavy. And there was more. So begin the story of the treasure key professionals refer to as an archaeological sensation that can compare with the great Viking ship discoveries. Treasures of inconceivable values 185 years later, this marsh still goes by the name \"Gullmyra\" (The golden marsh). A few meters away, the Randsfjord railway plows through the flat terrain with hills in the background. The marsh can hardly be seen as a hollow in the landscape. It still comes people with metal detectors there, who ask to search for objects in the soil. And everyone who has driven a tractor in that area over the years has watched closely if something interesting is thrown off the ground. So far, only iron scrap has been found that cannot match the treasure Halvor found in the 19th century. Today it is Ole B. Hoen who owns the farm. In the hallway hangs a family treasure. Here, says Ole, is the shovel Halvor used when finding the gold. He holds out a solid wooden spade. The blade is covered with iron.  It,s so nice that it was taken care of, and not just thrown on the barn or put into further use, says Hoen. He is a direct descendant in the 8th paragraph after Borger Christophersen Hoen, who made sure that the solid gold treasure became part of our common heritage from the Viking Age. The gold ring the tenant Halvor got on the shovel was not the only thing to be find. Down in the ditch he saw an elevation. Carefully he dug further. Hidden inside what looked like some white film was another necklace, several bracelets, a whole bunch of gold coins, finger rings, buckles and pendants - a total of 2.5 kg. All in the purest gold. Incredibly great values \u200b\u200bfor the man who grew up as one of the eleven siblings at the farmer's home Langedok under \u00d8vre Haave in Notodden.  Photo: The crofter (Norwegian; husmannsplassen) Langedok in Telemark, where Halvor Torstensen Kvernmoen was born. It must be allowed to wonder if Halvor, who had lived his entire life through hard work and in small conditions, was tempted to keep at least some of what he dug up from the marsh. Could he at least have been playing with the idea? Probably not. Back in the time when Halvor Torstensen Kvernmoen's lived, even the simplest thefts were severely punished. A tenant lived on the mercy of others. Being hardworking and honest was his capital. He went straight to the farmer and announced the discovery. The news of the treasure spread and reached Heddal, where Halvor grew up in the crofter of the powerful Haave family. The fact that this family was the last private owners of Heddal Stave Church (Norwegian; Heddal stavkirke) says a lot about its prosperity.  Photo: Brooch from the Hoen treasure. Almost immediately after the discovery, there was an offer to buy the Viking treasures. Professor Christopher Holmboe at the University of Christiania reveals this in a publication published in 1835. It should have been Borger Hoen who told the professor that he was offered a small amount of money for the treasures. But luckily, the farmer on Nedre Hoen had other plans. The tenant became \u201cThe Goldman\". On August 20, 1834, a very special horse-carriage left Nedre Hoen on Hokksund, with a course for Christiania (the name back then of the Norwegian capital, now Oslo). A long ride. Probably, the farmer/landlord Borger Christophersen Hoen had put into use his stately carriage as he made his way to Christiania with his tenant Halvor Torstensen Kvernmoen. With them, they brought the gold Halvor had found in the marsh a few days earlier. At that time, there was no obligation of submission when it comes to findings of such treasures, like it is nowadays. Mr. Hoen went to Christiania to hand over the entire treasure to the Ministry of Finance. He understood that the interests of the community had to come before his own interests. Thanks to these the two men, we are all allowed to see this impressive treasure of gold which Kulturhistorisk Museum (Cultural History Museum) manages. Mr. Hoen was paid a finder\u2019s fee equivalent to the value of the gold, which was set at 2060 spesidaler *). This amount of spesidaler was reportedly so significant that it had to be paid during two years, in order to avoid overturning of the government budget. The farmer chose to share the amount equally with his tenant. And with this, Halvor Torstensen Kvernmoen became a very rich man.The money he received in 1834 amounted to an incredible 49 annual salaries for a tenant/farmhand. *) Spesidaler was the Norwegian currency back then. When kroner became the Norwegian currency in 1875, one spesidaler was exchanged for 4 kroner. Norwegian kroner is today internationally called NOK. I don't know what happened to him after that, more than he bought a farm, says Ole B. Hoen.  For those who want to read more, the article continue as follows;  Photo: Some of the gold treasure from the Viking Age found on Nedre Hoen. There are no bridal pictures or other pictures of Inger and Halvor. They had married 25 years before Halvor found the treasure, and together they had four children, all of whom were confirmed in Heddal Stave Church.  Photo: Archaeologist Hanne Lovise Aannestad with the Hoen treasure from the vault of the museum. After being a tenant at the place Kvernhusmoen, Halvor took the name Kvernmoen. That was the name he signed with when in 1836 he used the finder\u2019s fee to buy the farm Hagen \u00d8stre in Sandsv\u00e6r. On the 600-acre farm, he lived with his wife and their then grown up children until he died in 1842, a few years after his luck brought him money and land. Our thoughts wander to the housewife wife Inger. The closest she came to precious metal was perhaps some silver hooks in a fine sweater. If she even had that. We are lifting an arm ring. It is of braided gold, and although very heavy, the size indicates that it has been worn by a woman. The craftsmanship is impressive, and the experts believe that this, several other bracelets and the two solid necklaces are actually made in Scandinavia, perhaps even near the site of Eiker, by traveling craftsmen.  Photo: This powerful gold bracelet weighs about 400 grams. When the treasure was found, one of the theories was that the jewelry, coins and the many pearls were robbery Vikings had brought home from plunder. Some believed that the treasure was buried in the marsh as a sacrificial gift, others that the burial should secure the values \u200b\u200bin troubled times when the enemies were many. Still, no facts has been found for the many questions the magnificent treasure raises. The composition of the jewelry suggests that they can be associated with a woman, says Aannestad.  Photo: This is the heaviest neck ring. It is in pure gold and weighs almost a kilo. Now the treasure should be shown publicly. In the exhibition \"Vikingr\", *) the gold treasure will be the first for the audience to see when they enter, says Aannestad. - So it is the gem in the museum's collections from the Viking era. *) V\u00cdKINGR \u2013 New Viking Age exhibition (closed November 5th-22nd)\n - Museum of Cultural History  Photo: This gold treasure is the first thing people will see when they enter the exhibition, says archaeologist Hanne Lovise Aannestad. This gold treasure was so great and unique that it was a sensation. \u00d8ystein Kock Johansen, Norwegian archaeologist, author and expedition participant who was a long-time employee of Thor Heyerdahl, says the Hoen treasure is one of our most important finds from the Viking Age. Whoever had this treasure in his possession originally, has been sitting on a fortune. - If such a treasure had emerged from the earth today, with our media image, it would have created crazy headlines. I sometimes laugh when I see how little is going on today before the media uses the word sensation about a discovery. Had this treasure appeared today, there would have been press and television and front pages all over, with big, fat headlines. There is no doubt about that. The Hoen treasure is spectacular, it is important and it is visually fun for an ordinary person, he says. The timing of when the coins were made has made it possible to state that the treasure must be buried sometime between year 875 and year 1000. There is nothing to suggest that people lived on Nedre Hoen so early, and not at all a Viking chieftain who could afford to equip his wife with such valuable jewelry. But we won't be far from the farm in Hellefossveien until we find a real powerful man.  Photo: Ole B. Hoen at Gullmyra, where the Hoen treasure was found. \"It is one of the theories,\" says Ole B. Hoen, that the treasure belonged to the Viking chief Skot, who lived further up the river here, at Burud. Whether he sacrificed the treasure, or buried it to hide it, I don\u2019t know. No one who knows. In the book \u201cEiker History, Volume I\u201d archaeologist \u00d8ystein Kock Johansen mentioned B\u00f6dmod Torbj\u00f8rnsson on Scots, a powerful and skilled warrior from the Viking age. He may have brought the treasure to Eiker, after taking part in the raids against France in the year 858. Still, there are only guesses, Johansen says. He thinks it in that case would have been more natural to find the treasure buried at Scots. More graves of weapons and boats in the district testify that there are several others that may have brought the treasure with them to the Eiker area, and buried it there. Archaeologist Hanne Lovise Aannestad assume we will never get the answer to that. ** High risk security ** In August 2017, Viking treasures worth tens of billions of NOK were stolen from the University of Bergen. This will not happen with the much more valuable treasure from Nedre Hoen. When the gold is displayed at the Cultural History Museum Kulturhistorisk museum (Cultural History Museum), it\u2019s placed in secure specially built glass cabinets. The exhibition opening was actually postponed because the supplier was unable to deliver such safe cabinets at short notice, says archaeologist Hanne Lovise Aannestad. The value of the treasure is almost impossible to estimate, but archaeologist \u00d8ystein Kock Johansen believes that the value of the jewelry collection already in the Viking era had an equivalent worth of many billions of NOK.
