            "answer_text": "Be Jewish. So the Jewish problem is that Jews aren\u2019t just a religion. They\u2019re also an ethnic race that goes along with the religion. Until recently, you were born a Jew to Jewish parents who were born to Jewish parents. This meant that if you were Jewish, you couldn\u2019t simply convert religions and be Christian Jews or Roman Jews, because your religion and your ethnic identity was one and the same. Historically, bad things happen to populations that couldn\u2019t \u2018fit in\u2019. And Jews have never been adept at fitting in. They are always awkward outsiders, even when they look and act and live almost identical to their neighbors. They\u2019re almost always \u2018the other\u2019. And in primitive times when \u2018the other\u2019 was always trying to kill you, being strange was dangerous. It was easily to single out ethnic minorities and treat them as scapegoats. We do it today. Vulnerable populations become exploited, targeted populations. Jews weren\u2019t any different. What was different about Jews was they embraced their outsiderness. One of the first things they learned was that if you owned land, when people came to kill you, you couldn\u2019t just pack your land on your back and take it with you. However this is a problem since landholding is how you make money in the old days. So what to do? Why\u2026 be skills. Jews became bankers, lawyers, doctors, scientists, and highly literate, highly skilled individuals. When illiteracy was the norm, Jews enjoyed staggeringly high literacy rates. A lot of the anti-intellectualism we see can be traced back to Jewish otherlyness and their emphasis on intellectualism. The Jews also learned how to make the most of their situation. Early Christianity forbade charging interest on loans. This meant that loaning money was pretty rare. This meant that if you were a lord trying to get cash, the only way was to slowly save it up and hope that some big expense didn\u2019t come along and wipe you out. But the Jews had no rules against usury. So Jews loaned money, and charged interest. Now, not sure if you have student loans, but you probably don\u2019t think that fondly of them. Well, the same was for Jewish moneylenders. Everyone needed their loans, but few were thrilled to pay them back. And, in fact, one of the best ways to try to get out of a loan was to simply kill the people that lent you the money! But of course, this meant no more Jewish lenders, so you\u2019d have to rein in the mobs to try and attract some more and hope they\u2019d loan you stuff next year. Jews were also the perfect scapegoats. Black death? Blame the jews. Sick cow? Poisoned by a jew. Can\u2019t find a job? Jewish boss. Can\u2019t find a girlfriend? Jews. Anything could be blamed on Jews, and it was! Lost a war? Jewish traitors. Fire burn down your barn? Started by Jews. There\u2019s also a fun overlap with the OTHER highly mobile ethnic group scapegoated for everything: the Roma, or gypsies. In fact, both populations were interchangeable, as Jews and Roma would often have to relocate to avoid trouble. Some people believed the Jews were gypsies and gypsies were Jews! Two for the price of one! And of course, if you didn\u2019t have any other excuse, then there was the granddaddy of them all: Jews killed Christ. That\u2019s right! If you ever needed a reason to hate Jews, the church gave you one. A 24/7 excuse to kill Jews. Blood libel and other horrible lies helped perpetuate any brutality you might want to visit upon them.

            "answer_text": "Below are some of the more commonly cited reasons for antisemitism Charges of deicide- the charge from the Christian church and promulgated in the Christian scriptures that the Jews killed Jesus and that guilt was on all Jews for all time. This was often promoted by local clergy which is why Easter was often a time of pogroms against Jews.The fear of the other- Jews are different, have different culture and practices to others. In the past when many people never travelled more than a day or two\u2019s walk from their place of birth, and even such a trip was dangerous in many places due to the possibility of attack between cities, the \u201cother\u201d was to be feared.Most people never met a Jew in their entire life and knew nothing but rumors and stereotypes. You see this with Shakespeare- in his time there were zero Jews in England, they had all been expelled years before, yet still he wrote about Jews with the standard stereotypes though he did have more sensitivity towards Jews than the bulk of the writers of his timeEconomic- the vast bulk of Jews were as impoverished as their non-Jewish neighbors but, as now, people tended to focus on those who had been successful. Thus the stereotype of the \u201c\"rich Jew\u201d started despite the fact it was demonstrably untrue and the bulk of the Jews had no more wealth than their neighbors. However, it made an useful scapegoat and distraction when rulers needed it.Opportunistic- using Jews as scapegoats could distract people from what their local rulers were dong and made fodder to direct the anger of people against them. There was also an opportunistic economic element: when a local ruler had borrowed too much and could not repay the loans they would expel the local Jews, confiscate their land and property and enrich themselves while making sure they would never have to pay back the money they borrowed. This was one of the reasons that some Jews became diamond and gold merchants, easy portable forms of wealth they could take with when they had to flee from pogroms or expulsions.Racial- in the 19th century some perverted Darwin\u2019s works to claim there were different races of humans. Using these pseudo-scientific theories they claimed Jews a different and subhuman race. Under that bizarre theory the holocaust was essentially inevitable as once Jews are an inferior sub-human race, they cannot be converted or changed and the only way to stop them from existing is to kill them.",
