            "answer_text": "About 360,000, last I read, vs about 260,000 for the Confederacy. Actual killed in battle, though, was more like 110,000 vs 95,000. Many of the soldiers who died in wars at this time in history died of camp diseases, to which they were especially vulnerable due to poor nutrition, poor hygiene practices, and crowding. The side that fields more men would almost inevitably have more such deaths. ",
