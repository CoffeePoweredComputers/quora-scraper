            "answer_text": "That depends on whether you\u2019re willing to accept assertions or not. Some people accept the Bible as evidence. I accept only objective evidence. So the Bible is definitely evidence - that it was written. But it makes no biological sense that 7+ billion people evolved from a single pair even 9,000 years ago (and G\u00f6bekli Tepe, going back at least 9,000 years, tells us that there were people building things a lot before 6,000 years ago), and in so many different forms. Or that, on a planet with the amount of water Earth has (counting water vapor, liquid water, snow and ice), something caused it to expand to be more than 29,000 feet deeper than it is now. (It couldn\u2019t have fallen \u201cfrom above\u201d - we\u2019ve been \u201cabove\u201d and there are no great reserves of water up there - and 29,000 feet of water falling in 40 days would have sterilized the planet [falling water releases heat].) The monotheistic Sumerians living in Ur didn\u2019t travel to \u201cEgypt\u201d, become slaves, build the pyramids for 400 years, then \u201cescape\u201d to Canaan, vanquishing the local residents - we\u2019ve found physical evidence on the ground that tells us that Canaan was part of Egypt in the 13th century BCE, that the people living there came from Ur, not living somewhere else for 400 years, that the pyramid builders were skilled craftsmen, not slaves, that the residents of Canaan for more than 400 years before Rameses the Great (and until about 600 years after he died) were polytheists (as were all people in those days) \u2026 so which one is \u201cevidence\u201d, the things we actually find sitting there? Or one single book (that\u2019s been changed with almost every copying - read the Codex Sinaiticus, then compare it to any modern Bible) that makes claims that couldn\u2019t be proved either way when it was written - but can be disproved now?
