            "answer_text": "I would have thought a stone, there are plenty lying about. Breaks bone or stuns, can be thrown a short range. These may predate the human race. Then knapped flint to create a cutting tool and piercing point, thrusting and slashing weapons, but I think it more likely hunting tools would be closer to the most typical use. Then spears, requiring a flint knife to sharpen it to a point, then fitting a hard sharpened flint to the shaft with a stringy plant, such as flax, improved with fitting with pine resin (requires fire to melt the resin). I also note there are a huge number of mammoth skeletons found over a very long period, they are not small and can charge a small band of hunters, which would suggest cooperation between tribes to pursued bigger game. What is often discounted is animal-human co-operation, an animal taken from the nest considers itself part of the tribe! Eagles are better hunters than man will ever be (without tools), they will fight to the death if a family members is attacked. Returning to the smaller game and before this first known settlement, my own view is slinging (leather pocket with cord and stones) would be used before the more complex bow and arrow. Arrows with the addition of flight feathers and a strung bow (probably of animals intestine). The bow and arrow have the advantage that a hunter can be completely still before deployment and near silent in flight. No-one knows when this was first done, the critical components are bio-degradable and lost to time. One can understand how the crafts developed in this context, which led to more complex tools and trades, resulting in civilisation. Human populations are very small in these early ages, there is an abundance of food everywhere, it is Eden. I think it unlikely there are too many clashes between tribes requiring weapons. Tribes are more extended families, in tribe fighting would be rare. My own view is even tribe on tribe warfare also unlikely unless there is a food shortage or conflict over a particular resource like a supply of water. Reference:  ",

            "answer_text": "One interesting thing about walking out in a large park, field, or woods with your children. The boys will invariably pick up a rock or a stick. At a young age or older, they might be picking up an unwittingly symbolic pebble or long stalk of grass, but generally, it\u2019s a rock or a stick they can manage. We consider it playing. Our first weapon was something picked off the ground, a rock, stick, maybe even a bone. This isn\u2019t necessarily a weapon to defend oneself against a large predator, it\u2019s more like a weapon to be used, a rock or throwing stick that\u2019s instinctual to us, in case we see small game. If there\u2019s more evidence of larger predators, the implements are larger, and are actual weapons and it\u2019s a much more conscious decision. If you don\u2019t see that behavior, a male child entering into the park or woods, and it\u2019s not so manicured a loose rock or twig isn\u2019t available, and the child doesn\u2019t do that, he\u2019s either been influenced against his instinct, or he\u2019s an idiot, as depicted on the Blair Witch Project as it\u2019s natural to grab something to defend yourself with when in the woods and feeling threatened, rather than huddle in a tent and not be able to see what\u2019s moving outside, or putting a bright light in one\u2019s face, illuminating one to threat, and blinding oneself and jabbering away when vision and hearing are important.

            "answer_text": "Depends on how \u201cearly\u201d you want to go, and what you consider \u201chuman\u201d. Very likely the first items would have been varieties of sticks, which could be used as impact weapons or if longer, sharpened by rubbing against stones and then fire-hardened. Eventually, with the development of flint-knapping technology, spear-points of stone were made and affixed to spears. Likely the next development was the atlatl or spear-thrower, which pre-dates the development of the bow. The atlatl develops considerable power and allowed our ancestors to engage game at a good distance. Then the bow\u2026 A likely move from the \u201cfire bow\u201d. At some point, someone (perhaps a kid?) picked up a fire-bow and put a little stick on the string and shot it a fair distance. And daddy would have said\u2026 \u201cHey, do that again!\u201d By the time our actual ancestors, Homo Sapiens had been on the scene for a while, the \u201ctool kit\u201d of these people was much more refined. Very finely-crafted spear and atlatl and arrow-points, as well as stone knives, axes, and other tools. The bow and arrow would likely represent the pinnacle of weapons development even up to early civilizations. ",

            "answer_text": "They used a wide range of tools. Of course it depends on time frame and your definition of early humans. But I will make the assumption that you are speaking of early Homo Sapiens Sapiens (US). WE made stone tools for hunting like spear points and dart point, cutting and skinning tools of stone, bone needles and sinew as sewing tread to make clothing, shelter and perhaps even for cooking pots. They used wood for all kinds of things from canoes to eating utensils. They made mats out of reeds, branches and other materials, baskets and even \u201cshoes\u201d. They didn\u2019t use much metal, didn\u2019t have plastics or paper as such. They did\u2019t have glass but some had obsidian (volcanic glass) for making tools. ",

Then bows, arrows, metal tools, spears, slings, hoes, primitive shovels, stone or early metal knives, scrapers, leather tools like straps, clubs, sowing needles, I can go on. If you mean by early cavemen and species like Homo Habilis or Erectus, then stone tools such as hand axes and scrapers, fire to cook things with, spears, clubs, string, leather like straps (later on, with the Sapiens group), sticks to dig with, not much said here. Early Homo Sapiens would use most of these above. ",

Consider the \u201ctools\u201d that chimps have been observed to use in the modern era. You have stones used as hammers and tree limb used as clubs or digging sticks. All are at least dual purpose, for example a conveniently shaped stone could be used to crack nuts or crush the skull of an opponent. At the next level, these naturally occurring objects will have been considerably \u201cimproved\u201d, for example a pebble might be given an edge making it useful for cutting as well as simple percussion. A tree limb could be given a sharp point making it useful as a stabbing weapon. Again these tools could have dual purposes as a tool and as a weapon. ",
