            "answer_text": "Bengalis Are Basically Indo Europeans With Influences From Australoid, Mongoloid And Dravidian Influences(The 1st(Indo European) Being The Dominant Both Physically & Culturally). Although Many People Will Try To Label Bengali People As Non Aryan People, But For Them I Want To Say That, The Aryanisation Of Bengal Took More Longer Year Than Other Parts Of India. Aryans Migrated Eastword From Iran Through Punjab, Then They Conquared Delhi, Haryana, UP , MP & Other Parts Of North India And At Last They Conquared Bihar. But Their Main Place Of Interest Was The Fertile Land Of Bengal. So They Migrated To Bengal And At First They Conquared The Western, North Western And South Western Part Of Bengal At Around 500 B.C. After That The Migration Started More Eastword Expansion And Later The Aryans Migrated To The More Eastern Parts Of Bengal Such As Sylhet, Chittagong, Comilla. And At Last To Extreme East In Assam And Some Parts Of Arakan In Present Day Burma Too. This Combined Migration Took About 1000 years ( From 500 B.C To About 500/600 A.D).In This Long Period Of Time The Non Aryan Culture Of bengal Became Almost 100% Aryanised And The Non Aryan People Also Got Mixed With The The Militarily And Culturally And Technologycally Advanced Aryans. Then The Aryan Feature Become Dominant Both In Culture & Physical Appearence, & In Language Too. Bengali Is An Indo European Language Closely Related To Other Indo European Language Such As English, Persian,Tajik, Russian, Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Assamese, Odia Etc. Obviously Bengalis Are Not Pure Aryan Looking Due To Admixure With Mongoloid Or Australoid Or Dravidians, & There Are Also Non Aryan Influences In Our Culture. But The Main Course Of Our Bengali Culture At Present Is Aryan( Also In Physical Appearence) Due To Long Years Of Aryanisation For About 1000 Years. So Yes We Are The Great Bengali Race & Also A Part Of The Great Aryan Race. We Are One Of The Largest Ethnic Groups On Earth WiTh About 300 Million People. Many Of Worlds Great Scientists, Writers, Filmmakers, Philosophers, Warriors Are Bengali. Bengali Or Bangla Is One Of The Most Spoken Languages On Earth. So I Feel Proud To Be A Part Of This Great Race. ",

            "answer_text": "Bengalis as a whole wont fit under one race. Bengali is an ethnicity based on use of a particular language (Bengali) as first language by the population. The main races found in Bengal are- Indo Iranic (Indo Aryan/ Indo Turkish/ Indo Greek)- 15\u201320Austroasiatic- 15%- 20%Adi Dravids- 40\u201350%Dravidians- 5\u201310%Mongoloid 1\u20132%Negroid- 1\u20132%Unmixed or very little mixed Iranic/ Turkish/South European/Central Asians- 4\u20135%Mixed- 5\u201310%Important notes- This data is based on external physical features and not on genetics Many people in group 1 and 7 has recognizable mongoloid features too. Its quite hard for a layman to differentiate between 2 and 3 2,3 and 6 can be termed collectively as tribals or original Bengalis (Self hating leftists who mostly belong to group 1 love this word but really wont like it if these \u201coriginal Bengalis\u201d start killing them or driving them out of their homes. However since Bengali is an Indo Aryan language with a tremendous domination of O sound which makes fast day to day speech similar to Turkish dialects. So, if Bengali means someone who speaks Bengali as first language, then 1 and 7 can also claim themselves original Bengalis) Sometimes it becomes very hard to differentiate between 1 and 7. How did 7 come to Bengal???? Greeks were employed by Maurya dynasty as senior officers and posted as governors in various parts of India including Bengal. They were given land grants. Many Greeks from Central Asia migrated to India with their families. Slowly and slowly they started following HInduism. Then during Pala dynasty, Central Asians and people from the region of Afghanistan were encouraged to reside in Bengal. They were employed by the king. Pala dynasty was ethnically an Afghan Hindu dynasty and many people from Central Asia migrated permanently to Bengal. Due to such a high presence of Yavans, North Indians termed Bengalis as Mlechhas. Nearly every position in government and army was held by them. Their percentage had risen to somewhere near 15\u201320%. As the Pala kings captured territories outside Bengal, these people settled in the conquered areas as petty kings and governors or garrison members. Basically, they are the reason why Bengalis can still eat meat during Navaratri as they managed to keep ancient Bengali -Hinduism alive in Bengal and prevented the entry of Hindi-Hinduism (originating in Eastern UP) in Bengal for another 400 years. Culturally, this group has always punched above its weight and Bengal would have been different if this group had not settled in conquered territories in large numbers. Group 4 came to bengal after Sena dynasty took power. Sena dynasty was racially South Indian dynasty. Group 1 had come to Bengal after spending nearly 500- 1000 years in North India. The mixing in blood took place there. However, in many of them the mixing was little. Group 8 means people who got mixed in Bengal. Today people from any group can be from any caste. Its wrong to say that General Category Bengalis belong to Group 1 , 4 and 7 only. I personally know a Brahmin who belongs to group 2. This concept of group 1 and 7 being composed of General Caste people is a Leftist propaganda. ",
