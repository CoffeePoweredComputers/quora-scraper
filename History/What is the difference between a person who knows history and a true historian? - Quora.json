            "answer_text": "In French and German, among others, the word for \u201chistory\u201d and \u201cstory\u201d are the same. It\u2019s maybe just a happy accident that English has the \u201chi-\u201d prefix to inform someone that a story is supposed to be a factual description of the past. This underlies the trouble in talking about history as an amateur sport and history as a professional skill. There\u2019s a wide spectrum of what a person might mean when they say they \u201cknow history.\u201d I\u2019ve known several people (typically old white men, for whatever reason) who can speak endlessly about historical minutiae pertaining to some interest of theirs. Like they might be able to recount every detail of every battle of the Civil War, or they might be able to give you a brief bio of every person that signed the Declaration of Independence. But their \u201cbig picture\u201d understanding of those subjects are often skewed by a lack of training to contextualize that raw data. It\u2019s a bit like comparing a list of ingredients to a full recipe. An amateur who has all the ingredients but doesn\u2019t bother to read the instructions is going to have a rather awful final product compared to a trained cook who knows all the relevant preparation methods. Old dudes who can give bios of every signatory of the Declaration of Independence and every attendee of the Constitutional Convention quite often feel very confident calling themselves Constitutional scholars, and that doesn\u2019t save them from having blatantly wrong ideas about how and why the Constitution was written the way it was. Plenty of old dudes with encyclopedic knowledge of the Civil War buy whole-hog into revisionist explanations for why the war was fought in the first place. One popular subject that frequently pops up on Quora is the Galileo Affair. Every school child has heard about how Galileo was arrested and put on trial for teaching that the Earth goes around the sun, and it was heresy to say that the Earth isn\u2019t the center of the universe. So a Quora answer will invariably have someone repeating this fable, and someone will comment or answer with a rebuttal about how the story is all wrong, and maybe they\u2019ll try to argue that the real story has the opposite conclusion from the popular one. But for a serious historian, the whole thing is rather tedious to try to convey to a layman because the Galileo Affair doesn\u2019t satisfy our desire for a clean narrative with a well-defined line between good guys and bad guys. And simply recounting the story by quoting the primary sources results in utter gibberish because in one spot Galileo is clearly indicted for teaching heliocentrism, and somewhere else a Cardinal says crystal clear that the Church had no desire to make an official stance on the movement of celestial bodies. To a modern reader, it\u2019s all self-contradictory and bizarre. The historian, though, understands that those documents simply can\u2019t be used in a vacuum. The historian is trained to consider what the state of scientific consensus was at the time, what were the technical limitations of empirical astronomy, what the political pressures were for the Papacy, what sort of diplomatic tensions existed among the Italian principalities, what the behavior norms were for epistolary discourse among Baroque scientists were, and, finally, what were the personalities of the characters involved. Thus, someone who \u201cknows history\u201d is going to tell you about an epic clash between Science and Religion. A \u201ctrue historian\u201d is going to tell you that it was a political soap opera among a bunch of egotistical primadonnas where everyone came out of it looking petty, and neither Galileo nor the Inquisition were actually \u201cright\u201d in either a moral or scientific sense. If you were looking for a \u201cstory\u201d with heroes, villains, victims, resolution, and a moral to take home, then you\u2019re going to be sadly disappointed. I just bring up the Galileo Affair because it\u2019s a pretty high-profile example of perception versus reality in terms of historical literacy, and it\u2019s been cycled through Quora for years. The exact same conflict of lay history versus academic history pops up, well, everywhere in history. Sometimes this even results in a dialectic where people with a chip on their shoulder try to push the pendulum too far in the opposite direction. Popular history in the past always said Marie Antoinette said, \u201clet them eat cake!\u201d Later it became known that this was just a smear campaign, so she gets rehabilitated by kind words she said in support of the poor and she gets painted as a misunderstood hero. What was the truth? Well, the truth is that she was a young woman who rose very fast and never had the opportunity to realize that history would be judging her for her thoughts about social inequality. Catholic minorities celebrated Thomas More as a martyr because he was known in life for his integrity and he died for standing up to King Henry VIII. Hillary Mantel wrote a meticulously well-documented story about the situation in which Thomas More is a backwards religious zealot who wanted to keep England a stronghold of Catholicism. Which view is correct? Well, Thomas More would probably be embarrassed to hear that he was held up as a saint, and Henry VIII would be disgusted to hear that he was being portrayed as less pious and Catholic than More by Mantel. Similarly, the argument of Guy Fawkes tends to fall into diametrically-opposed people on the internet who both manage to miss the point entirely. People want to know whether they\u2019re supposed to hold him as a hero or a villain. Any historian worth his salt knows the answer: \u201cstop believing fairy tales and grow up.\u201d In short, a person who knows history can tell you about things that happened. A true historian can tell you the reasons for which people reacted to things happening. ",

            "answer_text": "A \"True\" historian usually has a postgraduate degree in history and works for an academic institution, or maybe a government agency of some sort. I worked for an agency that was responsible for indigenous treaty claims for instance, researching/ trying to find documents that shed light on what actually was said or what happened. There are the people that make livings writing history, and some of them are properly trained, but not all. Some of them know a hell of a lot about history, but they aren't necessarily considered historians \u2013 just writers maybe. The Holocaust denier David Irving was a self-taught historian, who wrote serious books about German history. He considered himself a true historian, but was caught out in a number of lies \u2013 letting his political views influence his historical conclusions, by suggesting that the Holocaust was a bit of an accident rather than a deliberate Nazi policy. I wouldn't really consider him a true historian, and when he sued someone who called him a liar, his ideas were very quickly taken apart and shown to be rubbish by true historians. ",
