            "answer_text": "British carriers were intended to be used around the North Atlantic, North Sea, English Channel, Mediterranean Sea and presumably the Indian Ocean all of which potentially are in range of land based bombers (and we all know what land based torpedo bombers as opposed to the anticipated high level bombers did to Prince of Wales and Repulse), added protection against bombs in the shape of armoured decks was considered a justifiable trade off against the smaller air wing able to be carried due to reduced space on board. You could make the carrier bigger but that would mean more armour, more weight, more power needed, more fuel carried etc so in common with tank design, naval architects strive to achieve the most effective balance between protection, mobility and offensive capacity. There is an optimal tonnage for any ship based on power verses weight and how that weight is apportioned determines how those three factors compare against each other. The US philosophy on the other hand centred around fleet actions in the Pacific which were generally well outside the ranges of land based aircraft and theoretically the carrier\u2019s escorts and combat air patrol should be sufficient to discourage all but the most determined enemy carrier based bombers. This idea was put to the test later on the war when land based kamikaze began to appear in significant numbers. However, lacking an armoured flight deck meant that the vessel could support more aircraft for a similar tonnage to a British carrier and in the Pacific climate allegedly made for a more comfortable working environment.

            "answer_text": "Tactical conditions. The Illustrious et al class expected to operate in areas where it would meet other planes (probably land based, and probably in greater numbers than their own, with better performance). They therefore reasoned an armoured hanger and deck was a good idea. Also pretty good against cruiser fire and later kamikaze. This didn't come as a free benefit as it reduced aircraft capacity, fuel stores etc. Good compromise though for a carrier designed to operate in congested waters such as the North Sea and Mediterranean.
