            "answer_text": "Tricky one. Politically Napolean was placed in a position where he Had to attack Russia. He had no choice His trade embargo with Britain was a long term strategy at weakening Britain (while at the same time strengthening Frances economy, as many goods previously exported from Britain were now easier to get from France) that he'd coerced pretty much every nation on the Continent to sign up to, was comprehensive, and it was starting to show an effect\u2026 till Russia pretty much tore up their part of the agreement and started trading with Britain openly again. A huge political slap in the face to Napolean. So\u2026 had he Not attacked Russia, it would have allowed many other states to presume they could also do trade with Britain again with impunity. If Napolean attacked Them, but not Russia, it would make the Emperor look like a hypocrite, and would be a an even bigger political humiliation, weakening his control over Europe\u2026 \u2026On the other hand, his veteran army would have survived. One of the crucial factors in French defeats post the retreat from Moscow, was that the French lost a disproportionate amount of their veteran Cavalry. (Arguably, had they not, then even fewer French would have made it back. Even starving to the point it could no longer carry a man, a butchered horse can still feed a fair few men for a few days) In every subsequent campaign, the French cavalry struggled to regain its numbers, and never came close to recovering to pre retreat from Moscow numbers. Further the cavalry they Were able to field were in general not of the same callibre as those veterans lost in Russia due to comparative lack of experience of the recruits, and the lowered quality of their mounts, as they were forced to take, in general poorer quality horses to try to rebuild their shattered numbers. This hampered not only the obvious aspect to modern eyes, the combat capabilities of the French cavalry in general, but Much more importantly, it Massively hampered the Light Cavalry in fulfilling their primary role. Scouting. In the days when pretty much the Only way a general could find his enemy, assess their numbers, disposition and line of march, im effect all intelligence gathering, was through using light cavalry, and at the same time stopping the enemy doing the same to you, again mainly by using your own screens of light horsemen. France\u2019s sudden deficiancy in this department, (where previously they were arguably pre-eminant) saw them at a notable dissadvantage again and again. (Most tellingly in the run up to, and during the Battle of Waterloo. At worst, The Prussian arrival would have been noticed hours earlier, preventing the shock that arguably caused the French army to crumble. Indeed the entirety of the Guard may have been deployed early enough to beat the British and Allied army, before turning to face the Prussians. Further, with sufficient Light Cavalry, the second French army may not have lost contact with the Prussians, and it'd have then been Them caught between two enemy armies.) The other aspect the deficiency in Cavalry (both Heavy and Light) effected was its other use. Harrying (and shattering) a defeated and retreating enemy or indeed, stopping the enemy doing that to you. After Russia, the French were unable to properly capitalise on battlefield victories as they had previously. They simply didn't have enough cavalry to crush a defeated enemy, and even minor defeats became much bloodier for the French as they didn't have enough cavalry to stop their enemies horsemen. So while the French army (and especially its cavalry) would have remained intact and shockingly formidable, retaining their ability to scout the enemy's positions and dispositions\u2026 to Not attack Russia would have shown the Emperor to have weak resolve, and may have caused many of the subjugated states (especially those in modern Germany) to rise up again against the Emperor, causing untold problems.

            "answer_text": "This is one of my favorite questions posted on Russian history. May have to devote a future podcast on the topic. From a Russian perspective it might have had a huge influence in the future of the country. When the Russians pursued Napoleon to France, it marked the first time that many Russians had ever been outside their country. What they saw shocked many. They saw countries where the citizens had far more freedoms than they did.  This new perspective would lead to revolutionary ideas gaining hold in Russia. The first such example is the Decembrist Revolt of 1825. Many of the officers and soldiers involved had fought during the Napoleonic War and had come back wanting reforms. The revolutionary spirit that was ignited was kept in check by the Tsarist secret police but not fully suppressed. Now imagine if Napoleon had not invaded. Many of these same officers and soldiers would not have been exposed to European ideas which may have delayed the radicalization of many Russians. Would it have held off the Russian Revolution? Highly unlikely as the Tsars were a dying breed and you could hold off revolutionary ideas from being spread over time. What it might have done is delay things somewhat barring the creation of the Bolshevik movement and the USSR. Another issue would be the place Russia would take post war. They became the de facto policeman of Europe suppressing a number of revolts. They also kept expanding which concerned many neighboring countries as well as France and Great Britain. Out of this expansion we had the Crimean War. That might never have happened had Napoleon not decided to invade Russia.  Lots of other changes in Russian history might have happened that will take some lengthy consideration. ",
