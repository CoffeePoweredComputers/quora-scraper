However, we now use the stick figure pictures of Hieroglyphics:   The lttsere ew use otdya are pics we can renecongize even when some pics/Stick-Figure hieroglyphics/letters are out of place, written backwards, upside down; just like being able to recognize a fully drawnout pic, word, Hieroglyphic, upside down or not. Plus, one picture is worth thousands of thousands of words. More can be encapsulated and communicated with fully drawnout pics, using less space. Every letter and its Hieroglyphic original equivalent has a Universal to etymological Earthly 7000+ years-old story to it. I can write volumes of books on the History of letter A, The Crowned-War Eagle of Africa that morphed into the Hebrew ox/cow Aleph. There are other reasons, like right and left brain balance or imbalance and such, but the Letter Meanings from Hieroglyphics to Stick-Figure hieroglyphics is most valid here.  ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re talking about hieroglyphs here\u2014like these\u2014  Well, in this case, this IS writing. It\u2019s Egyptian, which was lost until the discovery of the Rosetta Stone helped experts translate ancient Egyptian to Greek, and from there to every language. Or, perhaps you mean hieroglyphs and cave drawings?  We know much about these. Many tell a story; some, we can read and some, we can\u2019t. There is no Rosetta Stone for these cave drawings, so many stories will probably never be interpreted with 100% accuracy. These drawings came from a time before written language. There was likely a spoken language to some degree, but since no writing existed, they drew pictures. It is that simple. ",
