            "answer_text": " Well I\u2019m from Istanbul and I visited Greece twice, my second visit being 2-weeks-long and covering many places just this summer, I think I\u2019d say: The common dishes we have are actually not extremely similar anymore as we have been two separate communities for a long time and ingredients & cooking methods have evolved differently. But, \u201cpolitika\u201d version of certain dishes are almost exactly the same as what we have in Turkey (since \u201cpolitika\u201d refers to Istanbul, this only makes sense):Baklava in Greece has no pistachio (and syrup) because pistachio in Greece is found only on a single island in small amounts while in Turkey we use pistachio for many dishes from kebabs to desserts. I already knew about this but it still made me feel a bit awkward seeing something so familiar yet so different.I sadly tasted the awful difference between Greek and Turkish coffee. Sorry guys, it\u2019s really not for me, you basically ruined it! (no offence intended, well maybe a bit) The difference between the coffee beans is not the trouble but it\u2019s rather the method they make it in Greece nowadays. I learned from my Greek friends that at cafes, they use espresso machines to make it, preposterous! What\u2019s wrong with cezve like the everyone has at home? Or why don\u2019t you just buy a Turkish coffee maker from Ar\u00e7elik like Greeks living near Turkey do? Jeez\u2026 To be honest, it was a big disappointment for me\u2026 Anyway, it seems that frappe and espresso are much more popular in Greece now. And from my observations it seems that the coffee culture in general has changed a lot too because when you ask for Greek coffee and then close the cup after drinking it (for \u201cfortunetelling\u201d, read: to kill time), people treat you like a grandmother as if it\u2019s a dead tradition. In Turkey, this practice is still widely popular (and I like doing it, it\u2019s fun when you do it with friends) so I was shocked to see that it\u2019s long gone in Greece.Taverns have some minor differences. Ouzo-tsipouro-rak\u0131 are all different. Ouzo is too light in alcohol compared to rak\u0131 but turns smokey when you add water, tsipouro is just like neat rak\u0131 but it -sadly- doesn\u2019t turn smokey when you add water. But well, it didn\u2019t really matter much. Another difference about the taverns is that they don\u2019t bring mezes on a large platter for you to see which is something common (and expected) in Turkey. And variety of mezes increases as you approach Turkey, at least that\u2019s what I observed.I\u2019m still not over the fact that you\u2019re not supposed to flush toilet paper. I knew about this before I went there but it\u2019s still too different for me.I had no idea it took that long to get to some popular islands by a regular ferry (express ferries and planes are at least 2x faster but also at least 2x more expensive so what choice do you have if you didn\u2019t plan it weeks ago, right? My fault but still sad\u2026).Drivers were not as horrible as Greeks claim them to be, I mean, have you ever seen a Turkish driver?Rebetiko songs sound very nice. They sound much like Turkish songs, or Aegean to be precise. But seriously, almost all of them are about hashish dealer priests from Bursa/Istanbul/Edirne/Izmir. Learning about the lyrics was pretty shocking.Greek islands were a bit different than I imagined, but still lived up to my expectations of beauty. I went to Syros and Mykonos and I was surprised that only small parts of the islands were inhabited. I always thought most of these islands were full of houses. As the ferry approached to the island I followed it on the map to be sure I was really on the right ferry because for a good 15 minutes I could only see barren hills with small churches built on top until I could finally see the beautiful, colourful harbour, only then I was relieved.I underestimated how up high the temples in Delphi were, they really looked much easier to climb on Instagram.For most Greeks Istanbul=food, I always -stereotypically- thought Istanbul=Constantinople=Hagia Sophia for GreeksThe extensive and beautiful collection of Benaki Museum in Athens was one of the highlights of my trip, I didn\u2019t expect it to be that amazing, even the staff was pretty \u201celite\u201d.There were gazillions of Indians, Ethiopians and Egyptians in Athens. This took me by surprise, I had no idea. I imagined Athens to be pretty homogenous but to my surprise it was rather cosmopolitan.There are a lot of priests around, I saw more priests in Greece than I ever saw imams in Turkey. And beware, they are pretty strict about male clothing as well. I wish they provided a kilt for men in shorts like they do in Turkey for tourists visiting the mosques.Guys, don\u2019t fool yourselves, Orthodox fasting is not real fasting, what\u2019s the purpose of it if you\u2019re still feasting all through the day? Try the Muslim way, just sleep through the whole day without eating or drinking or literally contributing absolutely nothing to anyone\u2019s lives and then feast at night! What a way to empathy with the poor, oh these religions\u2026I realised some shop owners \u201close interest\u201d in you when you\u2019re Turkish, happened only 1\u20132 times but it still made me feel bad, no rude words or gestures but it was a bit \u201ctense\u201d nevertheless. Maybe the same thing happens to some Greeks at some shops here but I wouldn\u2019t know that.The number of words I can understand in spoken Greek is at least 100x more than what I imagined. Seriously, there are a lot of common words, even more if you\u2019re in Thrace! And the Greek alphabet is not as hard as I imagined, the only bad part is they have like 945873 letters for \u201ci\u201dThe way Greeks speak Turkish is exactly like how we think they do (which is pretty funny). They can say \u201cChicago\u201d or \u201cshake\u201d but they can\u2019t say \u201cpa\u015fa\u201d or \u201cte\u015fekk\u00fcrler\u201d with the \u201csh\u201d sound.You can smoke almost everywhere. As a smoker myself I was pretty happy to see that but this level of law-enforcement better not apply to all aspects of their system.Obviously all these things were not \u201cshocking\u201d but they were all interesting to see so I wanted to mention them. Overall, it was a very pleasant trip. I\u2019d rate it 4.7/5 (because of the coffee!). I\u2019ll visit again at first chance to see the other parts of the country. If you were wondering, so far I\u2019ve been to Alexandroupoli, Komotini, Xanthi, Kavala, Thessaloniki, Agia Triada, Athens, Piraeus, Delphi, Sounion, Loutraki, Korinth, Nafplion, Galatas, Poros, Epidavros, Mycenae, Syros and Mykonos.

            "answer_text": "Given that I have been going to the country for the past 9 years, a lot of things that initially shocked me I got used to at this point and don\u2019t pay that much attention as I did at first. However, one thing not only shocks me but downright leaves me asking whether the same people who do this would like the same thing done to them in the middle of July/August when the Greek sun is burning at its maximum capacity. Charging to use the AC. Honestly, I have been in more than 15 countries and I have never, ever had a situation in which I had to pay to use the AC in the summer. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I am well aware that people can sometimes crack the AC and leave it to cool down their apartments while they are on the beach and such, which does bring the bill up for those who rent out the apartments, but I still find it to be very stingy and torture. This is not a general thing in Greece, but in a lot of places you find apartments who have this rule, although there are obviously some exceptions. I always have this wish to ask those people \u201cwould you like to be without AC in the middle of the summer when temperatures go to 37 degrees?\u201d If I wanted a sauna I would fine one where I am, and not travel 900km south to get it. That\u2019s something I will never understand, even though we are now much more picky and never go to apartments which implement this (IMHO, unnecessary rule). And the saddest part is, there are truly some who rent out apartments who think that expecting someone to be without AC on 36 degrees is reasonable. In that case, I\u2019d love to put that person into an apartment with no option to use it and just see how pleasant it is to be in such conditions. I love Greece, I truly do and it has become my second home, I love the people, love the food and the atmosphere - but there are some things I truly can\u2019t comprehend to this day. ",
