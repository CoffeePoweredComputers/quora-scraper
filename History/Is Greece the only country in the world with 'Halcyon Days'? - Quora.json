            "answer_text": " The phenomenon \u201chalcyon days\u201d refers to a period of time, in the middle of winter, normally at the mid of January. It usually lasts 10 to 15 days. It is then sunny, the days are full of light, the weather is mild. Meteorologically, the barometric pressures between northern and southern Europe equalize during at that period. The Greek Myth behind the Phenomenon:Halcyon the daughter of the god of winds Aeolus was married to Ceyx. They were a happy couple with power very similar to Zeus and Hera, something that Zeus could not stand so he turned Ceyx into a vulture. Halcyon was sad and kept looking for Ceyx in the seas. Years passed and then the gods of Olympus out of pity turned Halcyon into a seabird with the same name. As a seabird Halcyon had hard time, since unlike other birds, she laid her eggs in the middle of the winter and the rough winter and sea waves would destroy her eggs or claim her chicks. Finally Zeus was touched by her crying. He offered a period in January with really good and sunny weather with calm winds and sea. Halcyon could now brood her eggs, protect her hatchlings from the bad weather. till she could teach them how to fly and deal with the sea waves. The meaning of Halcyon Days / \u0391\u03bb\u03ba\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 \u0397\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 stands for serenity, relief from the strong winter time, hope and optimism. For me as a child going to school in Greece meant I had an essay about Halcyon Days for at least six years \u2026 :) Halcyon - \u0391\u03bb\u03ba\u03c5\u03ce\u03bd is the Kingfisher seabird. ",

            "answer_text": "The Halcyon is a bird of Greek legend and the name is now commonly given to the European Kingfisher. The ancients believed that the bird made a floating nest in the Aegean Sea and had the power to calm the waves while brooding her eggs. Fourteen days of calm weather were to be expected when the Halcyon was nesting - around the winter solstice, usually 21st or 22nd of December. The Halcyon days are generally regarded as beginning on the 14th or 15th of December. According to Ovid, Alycon ( \u1f08\u03bb\u03ba\u03c5\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7, Latin Alcyone) was the daughter of Aeolus and wife of Ceyx. When her husband died in a shipwreck, Alcyone threw herself into the sea whereupon the gods transformed them both into kingfishers. When Alcyone made her nest on the beach, waves threatened to destroy it. Aeolus restrained his winds and kept them calm during seven days in each year, so she could lay her eggs. These became known as the \"halcyon days,\" when storms do not occur. The word entered the English language in the 14th century, gradually losing its association with the nesting time of the bird and taking on the figurative meaning of 'calm days'. Shakespeare used the expression that way in Henry VI, Part I (1592): \u201cExpect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days\u2026\u201d Today, the term is used to denote a past period that remembered for being happy and/or successful. Notwithstanding that they originally were in deep winter, the term halicon days tends to conjure up nostalgic memories of the seemingly endless sunny days of youth. It can be found in other languages as well. Friedrich Nietzsche used the expression \u201chalkyonische Tage\u201d in Also sprach Zarathustra to describe a short break after survived and before coming storms. ",
