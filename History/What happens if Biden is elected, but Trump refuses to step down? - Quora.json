            "answer_text": "Many Republicans are distancing themselves already. This does not mean they are conceding the election. They are merely playing the political game. He has gotten away with so much nonsense and corruption by enjoying unwavering support from Republican Senators and Representatives. If he loses they will have to decide if they are going to continue down a path toward anarchy. No President has ever refused to leave. It will be an incredibly bold move for any congressman to risk their career over an unfounded mutiny. Assuming, if he loses, it wakes these politicians up, he will no longer have the support he needs to wreak anymore havoc. Hopefully he will just quietly disappear into the hands of state prosecutors.

            "answer_text": "In 2016 Trump didn't expect to win the election. He expected it would give him a big boost in 'name recognition', and he planned to start a TV network as Sarah Palin did. Now, when he gets voted out, he'll whine and complain that the election was rigged against him (as he did last time!) but he'll go. When the helicopter comes, he'll get on it. A lot of stupid Republicans will believe him, so when he gets a job as a Fox commentator (like Palin did!) or starts his own network he'll have a big audience of unhappy Republicans desperate to have their prejudices reinforced. There might be a few right-wing bombings, from REALLY stupid people who took his message seriously. In the last few years, right-wing terrorists have done a lot more damage than ANTIFA or ISIS. But so long as he can't be directly tied to him, they help him more than hurt him. This is why he refuses to repudiate the groups that would be most likely to do bombings after he loses. I mean - - 'Stand back and stand by.' What does that sound like? But why would he do something that would immediately land him in prison? He'll have a hard enough time staying out of prison as it is!
