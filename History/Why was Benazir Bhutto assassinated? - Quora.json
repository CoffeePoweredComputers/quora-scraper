Zardari is obviouswho was the security in-charge? Khalid Shehnshah ( a criminial who was jailed in the same period Zardari was detained and his Jail-friend)Was it possible Zardari could have gained any political position in her life? of course impossiblewhy Rehman Malik, then foreign minister escaped to Islamabad from Rawalpindi soon after the murder?have we not witnessed the cronies of BB were kept far away during the reign of Zardariwhy the members of PPP chanted slogans against Zardari on ZA Bhutto\u2019s death anniversary, claiming Zardari is the murderer of BB and her brother Mir Murtaza Bhutto as I found in this video ",

            "answer_text": "It remains unclear. To understand why, the most important leading question would be to know - who? Al-Qaeda have suggested culpability for the attack as a means of preventing subjugation of Pakistani mujahideen but a recent Pakistani enquiry (August 2013) lay blame in the hands of Pervez Musharraf; something he has denied.  What is clear, is the woeful forensic scene following the assassination as revealed by a UN investigation and perhaps we will never have a clear idea of who committed the act, let alone why it occurred.
