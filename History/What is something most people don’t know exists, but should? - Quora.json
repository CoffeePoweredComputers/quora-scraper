            "answer_text": "Fire escapes at restaurants, clubs and other public venues.

It takes less than a minute to find out where the fire escape is located. And if you hear the fire alarm, leave immediately. 60 seconds later it can be too late. The Station Club Fire at the Great White concert back in 2003 is a scary example of just how fast a fire can spread. Warning for extremely disturbing pictures in the clip below.  ",
