            "answer_text": "The last 10 years I\u2019ve lived in in the small town of Uithuizen all the way up north in the Netherlands close to the Wadden Sea.  Foto: \u00a9 Joop Tap Nowadays this area north of the city Groningen is part of the province Groningen, but originally these Ommelanden were Frisian domains.  Uithuizen was located in the Hunsingo area at the border of Fivelingo. These areas, named after streams, contained farms and villages. The villages are usually built on a terp (or wierd), an artificial dwelling hill. The first hill was built south of the current one around 500 CE. When more space was needed they built a new hill north that they started to call Uthusen (outer houses) of the older village that was now named Oldorp (old village).[1] The first wooden church was built after the successes of the missionary Ludger in 9th century. Most of this was lost to floods and the first rudimentary dikes were built in the 11th century. The central St. Jacobs church was built in the 13th century. Quite a turbulent age: in 1231 a war broke out between Uithuizen and the village Eenrum [2]about drainage locations and the right to use the island of Rottumeroog. Even though this farmer\u2019s war ended soon real peace was only made when all the villages united in a war against the city of Groningen in 1250 over unreasonable price increases of wheat. The salty clay land wasn\u2019t suited for growing that, so the land was mostly used for livestock. Silting up was a continuous problem. The higher grounds did switch to agriculture in a later stage after ploughing and drainage methods had been improved.[3] Floods made many victims in 1570, 1686 en especially the Christmas Flood of 1717. New improved dikes impoldered more land that was divided among the farmers. A network of boat canals connected the villages to the city. In the 17th century manors were built by nobility and wealthy merchants. This photo shows the backside of the Menkemaborg in Uithuizen.  Photo: \u00a9 Ton Sekuur Driven by the rising food prices in the 18th century agriculture flourished. The farms grew richer and larger while employing many landless laborers. Many of these labourers must have dreamed of having their own farm. That dream came true for some brave emigrants in the 19th century. Between 1830 and 1880, 5,900 people emigrated from Hunsingo, almost all going to the United States. This was two-thirds of all emigrations from the entire province of Groningen. Most of the emigrants from Hunsingo ended up in western Michigan, followed by Chicago and a smaller group going to Lafayette, Indiana. Hunsingo - Wikipedia The landowning community flourished until the early 20th century as shown by many so-called rentier houses that were built. During the Reformation age the original St. Jacobs church had become Protestant. In 1860 a new St. Jacobs church was built by the Roman Catholic community.[4] Mechanization in the 20th century changed the farming business. With no more work available the region became depopulated. Between 1968 and 1973 the Eemshaven sea port was built to stimulate economic growth. This didn\u2019t really work out until recently. It also became an energy producing region with a number of power plants and a wind farm. From 2012 on many old houses were damaged by earthquakes caused by the extraction of natural gas from the Groningen gas field. For many years this gas field has been producing around 10% of the government revenues. That money has all been spent. Now that gas extraction will be cut off to prevent further damage it seems likely that there will be no money left to compensate owners for the loss of value of their rela estate, nor will there be funds to preserve characteristic buildings.  Close to my house a Gristmill still stands and occasionally operates. It\u2019s called De Liefde, meaning \u2018The Love\u2019. Coincidentally the same name as the first Dutch ship to reach Japan in 1600. [5]  Photo made by me. Thanks for the A2A.

            "answer_text": "  I have many hometowns but the current one is the town I\u2019ve lived in longest in my lifetime (nearly 15 years.) Vset\u00edn, in the Eastern part of the Czech Republic. Off the top of my head: The hometown I live in now first enters history in the 15th century or so, where there is mention of the castle on the hill. It\u2019s still there.  This was Knight Templar territory. Later, I believe that certain rebels against the Hapsburg empire fled into the region, which is mountainous, and settled here. There also seems to be some connection between some Romanian settlers, as some of the local dialect has words that have cognates in Romanian dialects \u2014 I told a woman that once and she got angry at me : Are you calling me a FUCKING gypsy???? I think that genetic studies have ruled this out, but the linguistic connection is there. What is now a town of 27000 was a handful of sleepy villages a century ago. Despite the bucolic look of the country side, tucked away in the valleys of these mountains are rather large factories \u2014 and a hundred years ago this was the case, too. During the Second World War the occupying Germans decided to enlarge the operations here and a large arms industry was built upon the industry that the Czechs already had.) During the Communist years the government decided to do the same and made it a center for arms industry. The town was made the chief town of the region, even though geographically it shouldn\u2019t be, as it\u2019s tucked away into a corner of the Beskid mountains. As a result, the town grew quickly and the four villages basically all organically joined together. There are still factories that specialize in explosives here, although nowadays they are produced for the mining or auto industries. My wife\u2019s distant ancestor migrated to my town from Rokytnice in the 17th century, a village that actually just a suburb of Vsetin today, without a separate government. Its about a five minute walk from the center with modern roads and walking paths. This is Vsetin in the past. (a postcard.)  This is Vsetin now.    ",
