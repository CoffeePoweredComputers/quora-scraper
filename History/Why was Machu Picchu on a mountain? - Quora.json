            "answer_text": "Not only it was built on the top of a mountain, but on a very high one. It is very difficult to get to the top by climbing the stairs. Some tourists do that, and it takes between 30 minutes and an hour depending on your physical condition.  According to historians, Machu Picchu was built as a summer resort for the Incan Emperor \u2018Pachacutec\u2019. During summer, the weather in Cuzco (the capital city) can become very rainy. So the Inca, his family, the priests and his servants would travel 74km (46 miles) to the sunny and warm area where Machu Picchu is located. The reason why the city was built on top of the mountain is clear: you\u2019ll have more sunlight than in the lower areas, where the mountains block the sun and it can get very cold. ",
