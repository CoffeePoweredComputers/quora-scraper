            "answer_text": "Classic armies have a controllability limit that the ancients were well known. The Romans considered the two consular armies to be the maximum field army, approximately 50,000. The armies of Alexander the Great, Hannibal, Caesar under Farsalus, etc., had the same strength. Caesar's maximum strength under Alesia was 70,000, but this was a special case. The 80,000 Roman army at Cannes was uncontrollable, and therefore perished. The Chinese, who exposed armies up to a million, divided them into field armies of about one hundred thousand people, and this obviously exceeded the limit of controllability. The example of the Korean campaign clearly confirms this. The armies of diadochus were of a typical size of about 70-100,000 and they were poorly controllable. The real maximum size of Trajan's army in the Dacian and Parthian wars, apparently, did not exceed or slightly exceeded 100,000. Thus, the optimal size of a field army is about 50,000 combatants, the maximum is about 70,000 (Caesar under Alesia), and 100,000 armies everywhere demonstrate poor controllability and stability. The size of the army depends on resources and population. In terms of people resources, the ancients were practically unlimited. All antiquity falls on the period of the antique climatic optimum: it flourished with its beginning around the 8th century BC. and fell with its end around the 5th century A.D. We can say that ancient civilization is the product of the antique climatic optimum. At this time, the conditions for agriculture and its productivity in the Mediterranean were outstanding. Sahara went south, North Africa was covered with forests, Carthage had exemplary agriculture, Syria was the breadbasket of the East, along with Egypt. As a result, Rome itself, as a millionaire city, could exhibit, taking into account veterans and reservists, up to 100,000 army. The population of the Roman Empire reached 100 million people, that is, if necessary, the empire could put up a million army, but this was not necessary. Even at the time of maximum power, under Trajan, the army with a total strength of 250-300,000 was sufficient. The Chinese were even less limited in numbers. The Great Plain of China is a unique phenomenon, the largest single area of optimal agriculture in the world. Chinese civilization is a child of the Great Chinese Plain. Therefore, China is the only place in the world where the number of two opposing armies often exceeded one million. As for the Middle Ages, its beginning falls on the medieval climatic minimum. For 5-8 centuries, Europe was practically deprived of cities due to the extremely low productivity of agriculture. The maximum that she could afford were oppidums with a population of up to 5,000 people, and only a few of the largest cities (including Rome) exceeded 10,000 people. Rome was desolate, wolves roamed the city, cattle grazed at the Forum. Accordingly, the armies were extremely small. The beginning of European civilization was laid by a relatively short medieval climatic maximum, which lasted approximately from the 9th to the 14th century. With the onset of warming, during the 10th century, Europe suddenly became densely covered with cities and stone fortresses, and the population grew to such an extent that the main Italian city-states could afford 20-30 thousand armies, and the excess of forces that Europe sent to the Crusades, measured in the hundreds of thousands. During the Hundred Years War, France could afford to put 50-60,000 people in the field, of which up to 20,000 were heavy cavalry. However, the medieval climatic optimum was colder than the antique one, and the agricultural productivity of European civilization was much lower. In addition, she was much north. As a result, medieval states were much weaker than antique ones. It seems that the budget of the medieval English parliament would hardly suit any of antique polices, and would seem ridiculous for Carthage and Rome. Due to low incomes, medieval states could not afford either a qualified state apparatus or a standing army, limiting themselves to militias right up to the New Time. The first regular troops appeared in France only in the 15th century. The Black Death epidemic in the early 14th century sharply reduced the population of Europe, and then the 14th century cold went, starting the Little Ice Age, which reached its maximum in the early 17th century. As a result, the Thirty Years' War was again waged by relatively small forces: 10-15 thousandth armies were in the order of things. In the decisive battle of Rocroi, about 40,000 people fought on both sides, and others were even less. Gustavus Adolphus\u2019s army, which kept Europe at bay, barely numbered 30,000. A relative warming of the 18th century and the accompanying second agricultural revolution and the subsequent industrial revolution caused an explosive increase in the population of Europe, and at the beginning of the 19th century we see the armies of the New Age, when about 500,000 people fought on both sides in the Battle of Leipzig, and the Napoleonic Great Army during the invasion of Russia totaled more than 600,000 people. But in fact, the principles of controllability have not changed, and, as before, the army in the classical sense, understood as a unit for battle in a limited territory, usually within sight or within a tactical maneuver, corresponds to a modern division (10-25,000 men) or corps (30-50,000 people).

            "answer_text": "The size of the Army in the early Middle Ages were dependent on the size of the territory controlled. Welsh, Anglo-Saxon and French armies from the 5th to 11th centuries tended to be small, around 300\u20131,000 men strong. Major wars could see armies of up to 10,000, but these were rare and well documented (and often exaggerated). Classical armies, on the other hand, were much larger. A Roman legion could field 8,000 men and some battles could have multiples legions. Why the difference? The size of the country and the man power available. Rome controlled most of Europe, so they had a large pool of potential troops. Anglo-Saxon England, on the other hand, was made up of multiple warring kingdoms, each with their own semi-independent nobles. The pool was much smaller, so the army size was accordingly much smaller. There were also political reasons for the smaller armies of the early middle ages. Armies consisted of members of the noble\u2019s household. In Wales they were know as the Teulu, or family. This was similar to what was going on in France and Anglo-Saxon England. The Teulu would number between 100\u2013300 men depending on the noble. These household members expected to be provided for by their noble. Multiple Teulu could form up to form a Llu for major battles, otherwise these small armies would raid and ravish their enemies. Plunder was the reason for most early wars. The troops wanted their share of the plunder. This was much different that in the prior age where wars were either to take or defend land, or for a political revolt. ",

            "answer_text": "Large areas under centralized rule, such as the empires of antiquity, had the ability to draw on a much larger pool of possible recruits. Given that the population dropped at the end of the Western Roma empire and it took a while before it reached the same numbers, the lack of central authority over large areas, and the relative absence of trained administrators and military officers under the direct control of the king or emperor, it was not possible to raise or control such large armies. Also, the post-imperial period was feudal, so the king could only raise troops by persuading the lords to bring their own private armies to him. This make command and control very interesting, to say, the least, and there were numerous instances where one or more lords had a change of heart on the battlefield. Also, as stated elsewhere, it is often not known how many combatants there were in the respective armies, and probably in most cases there was not an exact head count anyway. It is easier in the case of the Romans, since they used standard unit sizes - but were they always up to strength? Another issue is logistics. The Romans brought their supplies along, medieval armies pillaged and lived off the land. That alone made it hard to keep a large army together, and many a campaign was hampered by starvation and disease. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it is primarily size of the realm, but also other factors, such as worse communications. In ancient times, there were those huge empires, like the Roman empire, which stretched across huge amounts of territory and had population in tens of millions. Medieval, especially early medieval polities were much much smaller. England, for example, which in Roman times was just a province, split into a dozen kingdoms, and each of those kings ruled over a plot of land not much larger than a Roman farm. That was also reflected in the size of armies in the period, not infrequently battles were fought by 80 guys against 60 from the other realm. ",

Secondly, you need to consider the source and his agenda, most were chroniclers of the king/ruler and as such wanted to amplify their victory by being conservative with their own side and exagerating the enemy - writing down your king gloriously overcame 17 men with an army of 5000 wins you no favours! Thirdly ancient armies tended to have large numbers of hangers-on that travelled with the army that (when it suited) would have been included in the overall totals ",
