            "answer_text": "It depends. You can see every chess opening in MCO-15 You can find the divisions and names in ECO, just Google \u201cEncylopedia of Chess openings.\u201d You can print it out. You can learn chess openings in two easy ways (Other ways are more difficult): Pick an opening and get all of the important information information, including variations, from a book with a recognized author. Go to any good Opening Data Base (Or opening explorer) and the names and variations are given as you move forward from the starting position. But, if you are a beginner and would like to begin playing right away, just do the following: Start a game and follow these three things for five moves: Get a pawn in the center of the board, and support it.Get your Knights, Bishops and Queen off of the back rank and onto the board on the best square for each on each pieces first move. (keep your rooks on the back rank, and put them at the head of an open file, after you have developed the other pieces.) When you castle you automatically develop your rook.Interfere with your opponent being able to to do these three things: develop, control the center, interfere.After you have played more than twenty games this way, you can look at what moves you have made the most and if you put these moves into an opening explorer it will tell you the name of the opening.Here is an example:1.e4 You just put a pawn in the center of the board. Opponent now plays 1\u2026e5, he has just put a pawn in the center of the board.2.Nf3, you have gotten one piece off the back row onto it\u2019s best square and ou have interfered with opponent because your knight attacks Black\u2019s pawn. Two birds with one stone. 2\u2026Nc3, opponent supports his pawn.3.Bb5, you have gotten another piece off the back row and it attacks the knight which is supporting his pawn! Again, you interfereNow, if you put those moves into an opening explorer, it will tell you that your opening is the Spanish Game, or Ruy Lopez Opening, as it was first called. It is a very old, very strong opening.Every moving is defined in only a few moves. You can be sure that you have seen them all by going six moves.",

            "answer_text": "If you are going to do Chess seriously, then you should probably invest in softwares(Chessbase) and get opening tree and Mega Database etc. If you are new and not too sure about whether you really want to get into Chess big time, then \u2018Understanding the Chess Openings\u2019 by Sam Collins is a good book. Although it gives mainlines which may be slightly difficult to play out in a real game, it should be looked at as an introduction to all the Chess openings, providing very good content for beginner level, and should be amply supplemented by overall Chess study and improvement, especially by going through games played in the openings that you eventually choose to prepare. If you have been at Chess for some time, and still don't want to reach out to softwares, then \u2018Nunn\u2019s Chess Openings\u2019 by John Nunn\u2019s is another option, although the lines may feel a tad outdated. If you are an intermediate player, and play in tournaments, then after you have bought a basic book, you may want to buy books for your specific openings. In this case, the Grandmaster preparation series books will help you in the long run. Caution is advised though: the content provided is massive by any standards, and you should prepare only the basic lines first and upto the depth you desire, then play it out in actual games, see how it goes, and then decide what to study further. Regards and all the best! ",
