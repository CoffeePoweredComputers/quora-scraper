            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to say. I personally think that the Persian military was rather underappreciated. Judging from its magnitude of success, it should have been raised to the level of Roman legionaries or the Mongol cavalry alike, but due to lack of detailed history (In fact, since the Persians didn\u2019t write their own history, the only detailed accounts of their forces were written about the times when they were not so successful, i.e. The Greco-Persian War, the retreat of the Ten Thousand, and Alexander's conquests), not a lot could be said of them. However, if we compare them to military of later Persian dynasties, in particular the Parthians and the Sassanids, who had more details about themselves written, we could draw a lot of parallels and build a more complete picture, namely, missile weapons are of paramount importance, archers and cavalry are very strong, but melee infantry not so much. The Persians used to think that they had a strong infantry, until they met real strong infantry in Greece. Because they had to deal with horse archers almost every where in the East, one could even say that the entire Persian system was optimized to fight against them, given the prevalence of archery in Persian armies. In what limited histories we have available, the defeat of Cyrus by the Massagetae was not recorded in detail, while in Darius\u2019 campaign against the Scythians, the Scythians did not dare to face the Persians in battle, and kept retreating until the Persian logistics could no longer catch up. Comparison of the Persians against the Greeks is more complicated. While it was beyond doubt that the Greeks were much better infantrymen, as seen in Marathon and Thermopylae, the classical Greek army had little missile and cavalry components. As shown by the battle of Plataea, once the Persians switch their tactics from clashing with the Greeks head on to harassment by archers and cavalry, the Greeks couldn\u2019t really deal with it. Had not just one, but two misfortunes struck the Persians in succession (Mardonius moving up the infantry too prematurely, and him falling in battle), it would be unlikely for the Greeks to have won. Another case, the successful retreat of the Ten Thousand from the heartlands of Babylon to Trebizond, fighting through numerous Persians opposition, was often used to argue that the Greeks are much better soldiers than the Persians. However, I think that, in general, while it was true that Greek discipline was hard for the Persians to overcome, it would still be nearly impossible for them to defeat the Persians in open battle, provided that the Persians do not make mistakes, because the Greeks simply could not deal with the archers and cavalry. By the time when Alexander entered Asia, both sides had changed significantly. The Greeks now have a much stronger light infantry and cavalry, giving them a real chance of victory. However the Persians have also improved, hiring Greek mercenaries in their army, thus acquiring a reliable infantry. The Persian army of this time was once thought of as a inferior army in terms of organization. Nevertheless, I think this was due to an under appreciation of the things that the Persians were good at, and that the they had a decent chance of victory at both Issus and Gaugamela if Alexander wasn\u2019t in command. As for later dynasties, the Parthians were even more nomad oriented, and had the Roman army unprepared for horse archery badly mauled multiple times. When later the Romans learned their lessons, they generally had the upper hand, although the fighting was still difficult. The Sassanids were more classical Persian, and in its time witnessed a 180 degree turn in Roman military\u2014from infantry dominated to cavalry dominated. This in itself attested to the effectiveness of Sassanid military, because this transformation was heavily influenced by the cavalry-archer dominated Sassanids. ",

            "answer_text": "Very strong. Consider that under Cyrus the Great, the Persians went from a barely mentioned tiny kingdom to having conquered or defeated the major powers of the day - Babylon, Lydia, Egypt, and Assyria. The Persian army was pretty lightly armored. The core was composed of archers, which were protected by light infantry with spears and wicker shields. The archers were capable of launching 5\u201310 arrows per minute, and there could be 20\u201350,000 of them in a Persian field army. They were flanked by cavalry of excellent quality. The troops were levies, and came from the dozens of cultures that the empire had assimilated. The only exception are the Royal Immortals, professional soldiers who formed an elite corps. The Persians had trouble with two main types of opponent, neither of which they encountered in their initial conquests. The first were the horse archers of the stepped peoples such as the Scythians. An army based on infantry and archers simply can\u2019t do much against a foe that can just run away when outnumbered, and has no permanent settlements that can be captured. Persian history contains a number of failed expeditions into he steppes. The second were the Greeks. Heavily armored in bronze and protected by both their own shield and that of the man next to them, they proved an impossible nut for the Persians to crack. ",
