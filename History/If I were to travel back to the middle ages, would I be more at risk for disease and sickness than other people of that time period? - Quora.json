            "answer_text": "If you are a substantially younger person than me then you probably don't have a vaccination against small pox. However smallpox epidedemics wasn't very common in most of that period. It occurred more towards the Renaissance, as trade-routes became more direct. Black death is caused by a Gram negative bacillus called Yersina Pestis. No known vaccine exist against Gram-negative bacilli. Typhus and typhoid fever would be endemic. Don't drink the water, even with a vaccination. Yellow fever vaccination would only be relevant if you go to Africa. (You didn\u2019t say where you wanted to travel. Timbuctu and Zimbabwe , and Ethiopia would have been on my list of destinations in year 1200) There are so many diseases that we treat with antibiotics. Even when the cause is viral infection, the antibiotics kill germs that thrives on a weakened body. Which is why there has been an excessive use; it helped even if it wasn't strictly necessary. If you cannot bring some with you, then you might be in a worse condition than the locals. You might also be in a better condition as you probably have a healthy body. It\u2019s a gamble, just like any travel to places with more primitive health care. ",

            "answer_text": "Your biggest asset is your knowledge. On your plus side, you have had vaccinations against some of the nastier stuff (if you\u2019re old enough you might even be immune against smallpox) and you haven\u2019t been subject to starvation, so you\u2019ve got a better \u201cbaseline health\u201d. On your minus side, you\u2019re not the survivor of several epidemics and haven\u2019t worked hard with your body all your life, so you\u2019ve got a worse \u201cacquired health\u201d. But you know how diseases spread. You know that a wound can be disinfected by some distilled alcohol, you know that if you boil water it is safe, you know that a well next to a cesspit is a bad idea. You know about hygiene and that epidemics spreads between people, not through \u201cbad air\u201d or \u201chumours\u201d. If you\u2019d been cut with a knife and the wound got infected, a medieval doctor would generally focus any treatment on the knife. The only thing they did to you was to let blood, which wouldn\u2019t help. Don\u2019t let on what you know. They\u2019ll call it witchcraft and it\u2019s the stake for you. Say it\u2019s some sort of trick you learned from an Arab doctor you took prisoner during a crusade, or something, and make sure to wave a crucifix at whatever you\u2019re doing. They\u2019re viciously superstitious. ",
