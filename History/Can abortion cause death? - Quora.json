            "answer_text": "Abortion always causes death. Except in the very rare cases when the abortion is botched. The purpose of an abortion is to kill. A vulnerable and defenseless infant. The first measure of success in an abortion is that the killing was successful. The baby is dead. A secondary measure of success is that the mother is not dead. The third priority is that the mother recovers from the process without excessive bleeding, infection, or permanent damage to her body. The measure of success in an abortion never involves long-term impact on the mother. Such as depression. Sadness. Guilt. Decline in temperament and attitude. Or suicide. Even though a common result of abortion is a second death, by suicide. Six times as common among mothers who have killed their babies, as among mothers who have delivered their babies. An alternate form of a second death from abortion is the child from the woman\u2019s second pregnancy. And the third. And so on. A woman who has killed the child of her first pregnancy, is exceedingly likely to have one or more additional abortions, killing her successive children. Or were you just selfishly worrying about death to the mother, during any abortion procedure? Medical or surgical abortion is quite unlikely to kill a woman during the procedure, if it is done by a qualified physician in a proper clinical setting. Just as normal delivery is quite unlikely to kill a woman, during a normal delivery. 700 a year, on average, out of four million live births. Way less than a hundredth of one percent. But since not all abortions are performed by qualified physicians in a proper setting, the fact is that maternal deaths due to abortion are distressingly frequent. Women still try to perform abortions themselves, which probably has around a 50% fatality rate. And women still go to abortion midwives, and to non-licensed abortion doctors, where the fatality rate is also appalling. Of course, the major concern when a women recognizes she has become pregnant should not be about preserving the mother\u2019s life. Nor about preserving her lifestyle, and her comforts and her pleasures and her self-indulgences. The main concern ought to be the maintaining the life and health of her baby. And that should make abortion abhorrent to all women. Unfortunately, far too many women do think first about themselves, their life and their lifestyle. Abortions are done, when a woman decides the life of a baby, her baby, is less important than maintaining her lifestyle. A grotesque tradeoff. The ultimate act of selfishness. Particularly when most commonly, the woman\u2019s lifestyle is generally ruined anyway, even after a successful abortion, by enduring feelings of guilt, remorse, and shame. So yes, abortion does cause death. Death first of the infant, but very frequently thereafter, also death of the mother. She may die from a non-medically conducted procedure, or from suicide. Or \u2014 often \u2014 from self-destruction of her being, through recognizing that she intentionally murdered her own child. Her life is not worth anything after that. ",

            "answer_text": "Any medical procedure can cause death. But it is extremely rare. You are more likely to die from the pregnancy itself than the abortion to end it. Abortion is riskier if not performed by a medical professional, which is why access to it should be easy and free. There are some people who see any woman contemplating abortion as worthy of contempt and will use scare tactics to prevent her practicing her legal rights. Pickets outside clinics with huge blown up pictures of a tiny fetus to induce guilt, claims that it will be a regretful decision (it never is) and claims that it will increase the likelihood of suicide (not true). These people see the unborn as more important than the mother and they even go so far as to try to legislate against miscarriage, with women arrested for risky behaviours. Some states tell women abortion can increase their risk of suicidal thoughts. Researchers say that\u2019s not true. The bottom line is, an attack on abortion is an attack on women's choice. No one should be forced to go through with a pregnancy. It's immoral and there is a special place in hell for people who advocate it. ",

Yes, that\u2019s the whole point of the procedure, to terminate the life of the fetus (or zygote or embryo, depending on the stage of pregnancy). There is this rather absurd pro-life strawman which is to act as if pro-choicers don\u2019t think the fetus is alive. I should mention not all pro-lifers do this, though it is common. I saw one article written by someone who interviewed a number of scientists about whether or not life began at conception, the title was some clickbait saying \u201cyou won\u2019t like what they had to say\u201d as the scientists almost all agreed, life begins at conception. I\u2019m willing to bet if those scientists had been asked if a tree is alive, they all would have said yes as well. Yes, abortion results in death. So does wiping down your counters; cleaning products are responsible for so many bacteria being killed. I\u2019m also guilty of taking life, just earlier today I killed several ticks for accosting my dog. The question isn\u2019t \u201cdoes life begin at conception?\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cis life worth protecting from the moment of conception?\u201d. I would say no. I see no reason to protect an unfeeling unconscious organism simply because it\u2019s DNA is categorized the same as mine. ",

Depending on the level of growth of the group of cells within the uterus, such an incident might rank below a significant scrape of your knee when you trip on the sidewalk. At the other end of the spectrum is the termination of growth of a group of cells and tissues- perhaps even organs, of a type- of which would likely not survive outside the womb environment.. and by likely I mean I\u2019d rather place bets on the local football team, who presently look worse than the Cleveland Browns (a team with decades of losing seasons!) Some things are not meant to survive; at a micro level, mutations are a way in which a species weeds out what attributes enable the group to adapt, survive, and eventually prosper. Generally speaking, lacking a central nervous system, or major components thereof, doesn\u2019t top that list- at least for vertebrates. And since we\u2019re mammalian- I presume we\u2019re speaking of mammals; I didn\u2019t stumble onto an amphibian/reptilian discussion did I?- we usually grow our young inside the host body, meaning that it\u2019s not one potential member of the species who is affected, but two; and what occurs within the host body absolutely impacts their health, up to and including severe distress and death. If anything, proper abortive methods or D&E further advance the health of the host in present era than anything else, further enabling the potential to advance the species- that\u2019s the whole point, right? Keep poppin\u2019 out babies, populate the human race, diversify our potential to survive a changing world with new ideas and perspectives on how to improve life? It\u2019s not?? Color me surprised.

Dilation and curettage (D&C) basically means tearing the fetus limb from limb as well as removing its blood/oxygen supply. Lethal injection kills a vital organ, such as the heart, which causes death of the rest of the fetus. Use of prostaglandins changes the \u201cacceptability\u201d of the placenta by the mother, which leads to separation, contractions, and expulsion. The above all relate to the innocent inhabitant of the uterus. As to the mother, she may suffer fatal bleeding, organ puncture, and/or infection that can be fatal. ",
