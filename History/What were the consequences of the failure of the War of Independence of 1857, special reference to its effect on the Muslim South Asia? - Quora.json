            "answer_text": "The advent of the British on the Indian Subcontinent ushered in a new era, or rather a dark era, for Muslims. under British rule, Hindus fared better than their Muslim counterparts, and the latter lagged far behind. Whereas for Hindus it meant only a change of masters, for Muslims it meant the loss of power, position, wealth, and dignity. Indians, and particularly Muslims, were to suffer the most, politically, economically, as well as psychologically. Depicting Muslims\u2019 predicament, J. Masselos wrote: It was argued that psychologically they (Muslims) had not recovered from their loss of power when they were supplanted as rulers of the subcontinent by the British and that they lived in the past, in a nostalgic world of former glories. Muslims were, indeed, reduced to poverty and destitution as a result of British rule. Muslims\u2019 rejection of Western education and culture and their attitude towards their successors in the seat of power had indeed many reasons. One of these reasons was imperial pride. In fact, whereas Hindus were, by nature, too willing to submit to the rulers, Muslims were too proud of their past glory to submit to the British. The takeover of the Indian Subcontinent by the East India Company proved to be a bitter pill for Muslims to swallow. They had been dethroned and could not reconcile themselves with the current status quo. Anti-British and anti-western feelings that had long been building up amongst the Muslim community culminated in the Great Revolt of 1857. This Revolt, which initially took the form of a mutiny amongst the Muslim as well as Hindu Sepoys in the barracks and then later spread to the civilian population, is usually considered as a restorative revolt. However, the Great Revolt was doomed to failure, and many historians attribute this failure to, among other things, the lack of unity among the insurgents. The Revolt of 1857 was localized and poorly organized. The revolt was poorly planned and without a clear Leader. The sepoys could not get mass support. Even the ruling princes did not support the sepoys. On the other hand, they actively assisted the British in suppressing the revolt. Sir Dinkar Rae, the minister of Gwalior, Sir Salar Jang, the minister of Hydrabad, Sang Bahadur of Nepal, and Dost Muhammad, the ruler of Afghanistan was indifferent to the Revolt and actively helped the British against the sepoys. In spite of the fact that Muslims and Hindus joined hands in their effort to throw the yoke of foreign rule, differences related to religion as well as the diversity of interests served as a hamper for the cultivation of any feeling of national sentiment among them Notwithstanding the fact that Muslims were not the only \u201cculprits\u201d responsible for the outbreak of the Revolt, they were to bear the brunt of it. As the events of 1857 ended, the British chose to throw the cover of responsibility on the Muslim aristocracy alone. Briefly speaking, both Muslims and freedom-loving Hindus did participate in the Great Revolt, and in spite of that, the British decided to revenge themselves on the Muslim community, as the latter were regarded as the bonafide formentors and the most beneficiaries of the uprising. This anti-Muslim feeling was well reflected in the harshness of British reprisals towards the Muslim community immediately after the Revolt was put down. Muslims were to face terrible discrimination in all spheres of day-to-day life and particularly in Government employment. ",
