            "answer_text": "The British Library has a collection of all diplomatic correspondence between all British diplomatic missions worldwide (including Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil) and the Parliament dating back not just to the Triple Alliance War, but of course to the pre-war period as well. It also has detailed records of discussions in parliament on Paraguay before and during the war. If you are a researcher with credentials you can access this material. Ricardo Medina, a London-based Paraguayan researcher accessed it and made copies of all the documents on Paraguay of that period he could find. It has taken him years to find them. Ricardo is a friend of mine and when I was visiting London a while back he showed some of these copies. After you read these material it is abundantly clear that Argentina and Brazil acted at the behest of the British government to destroy Paraguay. The proof is there, documented painstakingly by the British themselves. All you have to do is go to the British Library and read it. It is unbelievable, but it is all there. Assassination attempts funded by the British government, how money changed hands to foot the bill, discussions with Brazilian and Argentine officials on how to intervene military to change the regime in Paraguay to one more advantageous to British interest. All there. For example, it is very interesting to read official British correspondence on Argentina asking Francisco Solano Lopez to mediate in one of their civil wars. They basically wrote that Solano Lopez was usurping a role that was naturally reserved for the British Crown. Saying they were alarmed would be an understatement. Another interesting document is a record of a debate in Parliament on whether Great Britain should engaged in a policy of regime change by proxy in Paraguay. They were split into two factions. The one against it considered it immoral. They voted and the pro-intervention camp won. The arguments of both parties are documented. The report of the commandant of the flotilla that tried to sink Solano Lopez\u2019s Tacuari without provocation is also available and written in very plain English. The correspondence on the hiring of an assassin in Montevideo who was sent to Asuncion and caught by Paraguayan counterspionage is also documented (by the British). Etcetera, etcetera. I don\u2019t think that the Triple Alliance War was ever winnable for Paraguay, but I also think that once a friendly government in Uruguay was gone, in view of years of overt and covert operations against Paraguay supported by the world\u2019s superpower of the time, the scenario before the Paraguayan government of that time was rather grim. It might have been a matter of waiting for imminent invasion or attacking first to restore an ally in Uruguay. Obviously on hindsight the latter was never possible. The documents I mentioned do tell a different story that explains partly what happened. A story that has never been told and probably will never be (as Ricardo just timidly published a few very short newspaper articles in Spanish on a very little part of his findings). I hope more researchers will go to the British Library and publish books on what these documents are telling us so clearly. ",

            "answer_text": "Not using Uruguay\u2019s internal politics as a casus belli: that only secured that both Argentina and Brazil would become its enemies by messing with their Oriental pawn. They also lacked the manpower for a long conflict (we all know what happened to its male population after six years of unrelenting war), but could have won a quick, destabilizing war against Argentina (the provincial governor of Entre R\u00edos, Ricardo L\u00f3pez Jord\u00e1n, and the provincial army, favored Paraguay over Buenos Aires & Brazil), and then deal with Brazil. So, a quick war against Buenos Aires, in alliance with the northern provinces which resented Buenos Aires\u2019 centralism, and then a \u2018didactical\u2019 war against the Brazilians could have won Paraguay its desired influence in Uruguay, truly neutralizing it and allowing Paraguay free access to the Atlantic. ::What should Paraguay have done to win the Paraguay War in 1864?:: ",
