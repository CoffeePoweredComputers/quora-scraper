            "answer_text": "He was called Napoleon the Great in his own lifetime and well into the early 20th century, when the use of his image as a military leader by the Third Republic during WWI made it less \u201cpolitically correct\u201d to do so. The first official use of the epithet \u201cNapoleon the Great\u201d dates from the 9th of Niv\u00f4se Year XIV of the French Republic, or 30th of December 1805. Following the news of the victory at Austerlitz, the lower house of parliament, the Tribunate, unanimously voted that the Emperor should henceforth be called Napoleon the Great. Given the sheer scale of his civil, religious, and military achievements, it\u2019s not difficult to understand why. The enduring nature of his institutional and legal heritage has, as he predicted during his last years, proved more enduring than his military successes. But it\u2019s no coincidence that he\u2019s consistently ranked in the top three commanders of all time whenever military historians attempt to draw up a league table. There are plenty of references to Napoleon the Great in documents from the time, as well as afterwards (including the Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle). When Hugo referred to him as Napoleon the Great, he was simply using the epithet that his contemporaries were familiar with to \u201cbelittle\u201d (the soon-to-be) Napoleon III. While the latter turned out to be a very great man himself, his rise to power was the result of the confidence that the peasants and urban workers had maintained in Napoleonic policies that had provided them with a prosperity that they had not enjoyed since. Or to put it as many, including Chaptal (a very hostile commentator) and Marx did, the peasants (the bulk of the population) were Napoleon the Great\u2019s most fervent supporters, precisely because they saw him as their champion against the rich, the privileged, and the powerful. I\u2019d like to round off here with an invitation to anyone visiting the Paris area to make a detour by the town hall in Rambouillet. A plaque over the main entrance commemorates the donation of the building to the town. As a royal property, it eventually became the property of the State, and therefore of the Crown under the Empire. So the plaque reads as follows : TOWN HALL GIVEN TO THE INHABITANS* OF RAMBOUILLET BY NAPOLEON THE GREAT YEAR 1809 *Period spelling. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on your language, and how your country interacted with Napoleon. \u201cNapoleon the Great\u201d: 115 hits on Google, most of them referring to one book. \u201c\u039c\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 \u039d\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2\u201d: the Demotic Greek (so recent) form: 116 hits. \u201c\u039c\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 \u039d\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd\u201d, the Puristic Greek form (so the form routinely in use until at least 1960): 171 hits. Google Books: 264 hits. And there\u2019s nowhere near as much Greek online as English. Greeks continue to routinely refer to Napoleon I as Napoleon the Great; English speakers never do. To the British of the time, Napoleon was the enemy; to the French in his aftermath, his legacy is ambivalent. To the Greeks, he was at a safe enough distance to admire, especially as a scourge of the old order that favoured the Ottomans. Which now makes me want to quote Makriyannis\u2019 Memoirs, written from 1829 on. Yannis Makriyannis was a general in the Greek War of Independence, and one of the figures behind the coup that brought Greece a constitution, but he\u2019s best known as a gifted storyteller in his Memoirs. And this was his story about Napoleon. \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03b3\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 - \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 (\u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03ad\u03c2) The famed Napoleon, king of France, who honoured bravery and the art of war, and from a humble man became an emperor, an unfightable king: Death killed him with no gun and no sword, and he went down to the Netherworld wearing nine cubits of burial shroud. The whole world was not enough for him, all the riches of the world were not enough for him: nine cubits of cloth were plenty, with room to spare. The King of Russia, Alexander, went down to the Netherworld in the same garb, and the two kings greeted each other. \u201cWhat did you think, King Alexander? Did you think that you weren\u2019t going to die, and come into this life dressed with that garb? Where are your medals? Where is your great uniform? Where are your gold couches? Where are our flatterers, to tell us fables for us to believe, and lose sight of justice to humanity, and eat honest people alive and believe and glorify the dishonest? And those scoundrels blind us, to lose sight of justice, and all the innocent curse us that we have eaten them alive and left them hungry, barefoot and naked.\u201d \u201cAnd here the just kings, the true philosophers are dressed brightly, and the unjust are stripped bare by God, the true King of all, left to the rage of humans and accursed. For whoever you do injustice to in honour, life and liberty, and whoever you don\u2019t allow to live as a human being in the temporal life: they will curse you, they will not forgive you. What you tell me and advise me now, Napoleon, you considered at the time as little as I and all our like did. Those that believe flatterers and scoundrels and sweet-talkers, those kings and other worthies: they too shall wear the devil\u2019s garb. Let us go, Napoleon, and see the old Hellenes where they live, let\u2019s find old Socrates, Plato, Themistocles, brave Leonidas, and let\u2019s tell them the glad tidings, that their descendants are reborn, who were lost and erased from the lists of humanity. Those good and just, the light of truth, the brave defenders of liberty, with patriotism, with pure gallantry, with virtue and not deceit and trickery, have enriched humanity, and though they were poor in the temporal and vain domain, they are very rich in the annals of the world. For them, their works were struggles of virtue. And that\u2019s why God willed it so that he raised up their descendants, whose country was lost for so many centuries.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s nation-building propaganda, and yes, he had Muslim blood on his hands. But damn me if that wasn\u2019t powerful. (And a digression, yes.) ",
