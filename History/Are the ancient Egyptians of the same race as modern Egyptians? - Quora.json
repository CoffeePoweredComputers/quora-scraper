            "answer_text": "Well certainly, it just depends on which modern Egyptians you\u2019re talking about. If you mean these Egyptians, that have the same reddish brown complexion as their ancient ancestors, than you\u2019re correct, and I pretty certain most are E1b1b carriers. There Africans of sub-racial type I would call \u201cEgyptoid.\u201d Closely related to the Ethiopic and Nilotic branches. I would characterize them as having reddish brown complexion, with a reddish hue, smooth sloping noses not uncommon in many sub-Saharan African types, and square faces.  Kawab Tomb of Hetepheres   If you\u2019re talking about these Egyptians, then the answer would be no, even if they have some percentage of ancient Egyptian blood, they look like typical tanned Arabs.  Egypt became an Arab majority after a long gradually process of infiltration into Egypt, beginning in the 7th century a.d. with the general Amr Ibn al-Asa and Abd Allah ibn Sa\u2019d.(E.A.Wallis Budge,1907, The Egyptian Sudan) The Arabs eventually had a population explosion and it overtook the country, the dark skinned minority are the indigenous Egyptians, but they have been marginalized for reasons that are racial and political. Ancient Egyptian culture is a product of Africa, being that Egyptians share many traits in common with their sub-Saharan African cousins.The Egyptian institution of kingship being a byproduct of the primitive African-Rainmaker-Chieftain institution, it which the forces of nature are influenced directly by the divine power that Pharaohs are African chieftains are said to possess, distinguishing them from common folk.

            "answer_text": "No! they are not. Arabs hold the majority population in egypt today because of the Arab invation of North Afrika in the 7th century AD. After the 25th dynasty(the last indigenous Black Afrikan dynasty in Egypt), Egypt had numerous foreign invasons from the Persians(525BC), the Greeks(332BC), the Romans(30BC), and finally the brutal Arab conquest of north Afrika in the 7th century AD. This invations prompted the indigenous black Afrikan people of Egypt who build the civilization and culture to migrate further south into the continent and those who stayed, intermarried and bred with these foreigners reproducing bi-racial children who bred further and further, gradually changing the original phenotype of the people and more influx of these foreigners occupied egypt and other parts of north Afrika. Thats why the people in egypt and other parts of north Afrika today look the way they look. Modern occupants of egypt are not indigenous to it, but if you go further south in Egypt you will see indigenous black Egyptians(decendants of the builders of the culture and civilisation). Note! When Arabs conquered Egypt, its great civilisation was already in total decline, all that was left were ruins of a lost greatness. Most of the culture had been lost and forgotten, because previous invaders had perverted, defiled and destroyed it. Arabs in Egypt today and the rest of north Afrika, have no claim whatsoever to that icon civilization, and also no indigenous claims to that Land. ",
