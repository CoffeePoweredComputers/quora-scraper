            "answer_text": "Original Question: Who will win, Russia or America, when a war is fought between these two countries? Short war Answer: Russia will not if they are alone. The US cannot start a war with Russia without severe negative responses by every nation in Europe. After all, Everyone at the UN Laughed at President Trump in full public view of the entire world. An American embarrassment. Wars Answer: There are many essential reasons why any nation decides to go to war. These can be for profit motive selfish reasons of the ruling monarch, dictator or supreme leader. Other reason are for glory or to be known in history as a great leader or warlord who conquered more than any other before or even after. Which leads to great pride , ego and a false knowing of supremacy over any other. Other reasons can be for racial reasons in which much human atrocities and genocides have occurred in human history. All of those race based wars and conflicts were all based in lies and deceptions as expressed by the ruling government as propaganda campaigns. Propaganda campaigns is used by every nation in the world in this modern era. Especially in how the nations of the world use their media to express a normalcy of hatred for idiot Americans. Government propaganda campaign always precede any war actions or any non actions. Think about that. If you hate a certain group of people how likely are you going to have a desire to save those whom you hate, dislike or think of those people as stupid idiot who are much less civilized than your own nation is? It is propaganda and an existing plan that when America is destroyed and 300+ million Americans are killed or allowed to die. Your nation will do nothing and may even proclaim they deserve it. Even though the Americans have no reason to dislike you, and don\u2019t, and would in a single moment come to your aid if anyone tried to harm you AND you know that to be true. Yes, Americans would shed their blood for you. Why do you think American service men are present in your nation to this day? Federation Answer: When many lesser kings, rulers, presidents along with a supreme ruler can go after the strongest nation on the planet. Sometimes when other goals need to be achieved the biggest threats has to be neutralized before your own goals can be realized. This is called strategy. When the biggest block to what you want to achieve is a giant. Then you must put into place many varieties and many levels of attrition in order to knock down the giant which stands before you. Which means you go for the ankles and eyes. You go for the knees and ears. You go for the private parts as well as the throat. Then you do it all at once and at the same time. Think about the Vietnamese Tet Offensive and how it relates to the book written by Sun Tzu called The Art Of War. It is really an evil book suggesting to lie and deceive at every opportunity. In order to achieve all of your goals. This book is an essential read in the world of world business. Really. The Russian Answer: The goals of Russia is money and resources. Russia has for the last twenty years been out of all military agreements with the USA. While at the same time demanding that the Americans honor them all. Russia is not the USSR as the USSR is non existent. Which fundamentally means all of those agreements are null and void. Russia needs resources and who has the resources and who is in the way of Russian expansion? The USA and Alaska. Russia has made all new snow and ice fighting war machines. Which is superior to any other nation on the planet. Russia can do to Alaska what the Americans did in Iraq. How can Russia regain all of their former glory and lands? But, wait I just wrote Russia is not the USSR. Have you read The Art of War? How can Russia get what they want? The USA must disappear. The Chinese Answer: China has goals as well. They want to finally win their civil war. In order to do that they must seize Taiwan and reclaim it while executing all dissenters. Well, executing all of those criminals will acted upon by the USA. Hong Kong cannot be controlled until the USA disappears. Japan cannot be neutralized unless the USA is gone. All of the resources in the regions of all of the Asian waterways will be contested by the Americans who support those regional nations. This includes everything in the South China Seas in which China stole and built of those Island fortress commonly known as a military Picket. Military pickets are made to block military advancement of the enemy and to cause the enemy mouse admiral to move his fleets into your established kill box. Yes, even if it takes decades. China has been building and modernizing their entire military force for the last 20 years. Wow so has Russia. President Bill Clinton Answer: I know this thing as a fact told to me by first hand witness. A lifelong democrat from a family of lifelong democrats. I was even a democrat and NO I\u2019m not a Republican and NO I did not vote for President Trump. What is more important than rockets or bombs or tanks or planes or ships or professionally trained fighting men or space assets? No really, Think about this question before you read more. The answer is Guidance systems. Back during the cold war the USSR could not transition from one critical point of getting into orbit and getting out of orbit. Let alone actually achieving the orbit. The USSR failure rates at launching rockets and actually getting them to target was very high. While on the other hand the expected and very reasonably predicted success rates for an American rocket getting to it\u2019s intended target was very high and when The Americans miniaturized all aspects of their rocket technologies to include MIRV\u2019ed warheads. Even all of those MIRV\u2019ed warheads had a very high probability of exactly hitting their intended targets. After watching what the Americans did to Iraq and with all of the video feeds. I\u2019m not telling any fictional tales here. So now you know why Russia needed all of those rockets and nuclear bombs. Then the American propaganda machine worked it\u2019s magic against the American civilian in order to cause their own children to hide under desks in drills. So here we are, are you still here? So President Bill Clinton gave Russia our best guidance systems. He did that. Which is why every enemy nation on the planet has missiles and rocket which can do what the Americans did to Iraq. The list of enemy nations is Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Cuba and Venezuela. All of their military\u2019s have greatly benefited from what President Bill Clinton had done. It doesn\u2019t matter if his gift to Russia was a gesture of good faith. No everything has changed. Now, all an enemy nation has to do is achieve a good orbital solution and then ride that orbit all the way around the planet to their target. The need for full rocket powered flight is no longer necessary. Do you get this because no one wants you to know this truth that full burn of a rocket is no longer necessary and yet every military media source says nothing ever about this. Every rocket is measured by full power burn and the effective distance it can travel. Put it this way. North Korea successfully launched two satellites into orbit after a few failures. The satellites are called bright star 3 and 4. Guess what an orbital nuclear detonation looks like? A bright star. I\u2019m not saying there are nukes on board either of those satellites but there could be. If there are Russian or Chinese nuclear bombs on those satellites. They can detonate them at any time creating an EMP wave which can affect up to 1500 miles in all directions. That mileage must have a lot of things going right in order to be that effective. Yea, Life got harder for all military\u2019s of those nations friendly to the Americans. Thanks to President Bill Clinton. American Answer: Yes, The Americans will lose the war with Russia and their friends. Russia cannot do it alone. The US is still effectively defenseless to ballistic missiles that do not come over the North Pole or close to Northern California. The American navy is mostly made up of worn out cold war engineered ships. In which many of the destroyers will be retired in less than ten years. The Cruisers are set to begin retirement in about five years. No replacements has been revealed other than promises. The failures of the F35, LCS, Ford Class are what I believe are on going traitorous acts. You cannot have that many failures without posing the question of treason. The LCS class will most likely be retired soon. Military funding for officer training and armor division training is problematic. The funding for all repairs in the military is problematic. I can go on with all of the issues. China is getting involved in the infrastructure of the USA. China is involving themselves in power grids and cell phones. Once Chinese products with Chinese spy hardware is embedded into any aspect of the American infrastructure. It can all be degraded or shut down. What is worse is that every password encrypted across the networks will be fully known and all data across those Chinese made networks will be all in the clear for them to know all data packets and the information contained within every one. Russia can invade Alaska. China can insert special forces troops with every Chinese container ships that come into any American deep water port. Just as any illegal drug is available in every city in the USA. So to can both Russia and China bring in all manner of military equipment at their will. The piling on of a million Islamic men who can conduct more than 200,000 terrorist attacks inside the USA alone in one day. Then add in every other day thereafter. Remember the Vietnamese Tet Offensive. This one will be a modernized and evolved version. Yes, The world needs America to remain the light of freedom on the hill. Yet, as of very recently The Congress removed God from their house. Yet, the American Christian people don\u2019t care. The Christians stay at home hoping everyone leaves them alone.  Get your coffee first. 90 page PDF of boring data. Oh yes, This is not owned by me or by Quora. This is not plagiarism and is only for educational purposes only. Dated 2013: 7 years ago. Think about that all before Huwai hardware spy threats or Turkeys merging of F35\u2019s and Russian Air Defense systems. That would have been very bad if the US had allowed those two to coexist together. https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/documents/files/ChinaInfrastructure_Final_0.pdf ",
