            "answer_text": "The definition of a primary source is one written by an eye witness. It does not have to be written at the time of happening. If a person writes a journal, takes notes then years later writes an account it is still a primary source. A secondary source is one who listens to a primary source person, an eye witness, then writes an account. Anyone that was there at an event and tells someone else and they write an account if they quote the eye witness, that is a primary source. Primary means the first. If I tell you something that happened to me or that I witnessed, that is a primary source. When you tell it to someone else that is a secondary source. If I write the account, no matter how long I wait, it is still a primary source. This has been the accepted definition amongst historians for centuries. When I was studying history in school one of the most important things a professor said to me was, \u201cyou can write anything you want, just list your source so that in the future scholars know where you got your information.\u201d My family had six different encyclopedia sets when I was growing up. What I learned is that some of those sets had wrong information, therefore if anyone quoted from them I knew it was wrong. I never found anything wrong in Encyclopedia Britannica, therefore when someone quoted from it I knew it was correct. Wikipedia has a lot of correct things but it also has a lot of incorrect things. So, as I study if someone quotes Wikipedia I know that the information could be correct or it could be wrong, that is why I disagree with Tim Rupp calling Pigafetta\u2019s book a secondary source. It is not, it is a primary source. My source was getting a degree in history from Brigham Young University and various classes in history. All of my professors universally agreed that a primary source was an eye witness to an event. Some even said that if a writer wrote down the account of an eye witness that was a primary source even thought the writer was not there, they were recording the event of an eye witness. Now you get into the realm of writers and historians arguing with each other over triviality. Basically it is this, if the person was there, it is primary. After that it is secondary. If I write an account of Magellan\u2019s voyage it is secondary, even if I quote Pigafetta it is still secondary because I wasn\u2019t there. Pigafetta, no matter how long after is still a primary source. ",

            "answer_text": "An interesting question. On the face of it, Pigafetta\u2019s book ought to be regarded as a primary source. He wrote his own notes at the time and the information and experiences were collected by him. There are two factors that make me want to say that it is, however, a secondary source or, at the very least, a mixture of Primary and Secondary source materials. The first factor is time. The book was not published immediately after Pigafetta\u2019s return, it isn\u2019t clear when it was published. Because it was written several years later and based on notes it is, for me, one step removed from being a personal recount. There has been processing of information, the notes have been reinterpreted due to the passage of time and some of Pigafetta\u2019s bias has also crept in. The second reason for my caution is the language that the book was written in. Most of the evidence is that the first edition was written in Italian. It included translations from other languages including Spanish, Portuguese and Cebuano. By translating text from an original language you are automatically making the new writing a secondary source because you cannot translate a language without making some changes to the way it was written. So, while the recount of the voyage is a personal view and the illustrations, maps and information are based upon an eye-witness\u2019s experiences, I would have to call Pigafetta\u2019s book a secondary source of information.
