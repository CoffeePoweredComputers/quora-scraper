            "answer_text": "\u201cWill any of the former Soviet republics reintegrate with Russia?\u201d The question is if Russia wants to reintegrate with anyone. With due respect to many former Soviet countries. The fat goose of the USSR was Russian. One does not start asking your poor relative to return back after getting them to leave. The only thing that was binding them together was a now long dead ideology. Still am so surprised by how many people are convinced that Russia wants the Soviet Union back. Remember who destroyed it in the first place. They have nothing that Russia wants. As long as they do not mess with the security of Russia. Also remember that the dissolution of the USSR was not popular to 77.8% of it's citizens. Soviet Union referendum, 1991. The citizens of the very countries you are asking about did not want to leave the USSR in the first place. The only former Soviet republics that are keeping their distance are the three Baltic states. All the rest have strong ties to Russia. Even Ukraine and Georgia. Russia is the second destination for migrants after the USA in the world. All the migrants are from the former soviet republics. The money they remit from Russia makes up to 20% of the GDP of some nations. Russia financially still supports economies of those nations. For example. CIS countries have a massive discount on the gas exports from Russia. Low interest loans are a norm. Even Georgia and Ukraine owns Russia what they can never pay back. They happily join organizations were Russia is a founding member like Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Uzbekistan Tajikistan Commonwealth of Independent States All of them with exception of Baltics and Georgia which pulled out after its war with Russia in 2008. Population of Ukraine 45 million. Population of Ukrainian migrants in Russia is 2.6 million. Population of Uzbekistan is 33 million. Uzbek migrants are 2.1 million. Immigration to Russia that is legal migration alone. Count another 4 million illegal immigrants. Georgia went to war with Russia. Lead by the war criminal Saakashvili. The war criminal title was not given to him by Russia. It is one of the charges that Georgians wanted him on. Georgia was jumping for joy when Russia gave contracts to them to supply fresh fruit after Russian counter sanctions. Now less Americans in Georgia, and more business with Russia. As for the Union State which some with no knowledge of the region feel is been forced upon Belarus by Lukashenko. For starters, you will not know where a Belarusian ends and a Russian begins. Second, without Russia Belarus would be another Ukraine. The Belarusian does not need to sneak into Russia like the rest. Also how do they explain Eurasian Economic Union the child of the Union state? So please stop watching msm without reading up for yourselves. Russia was one of the three republics that distroyed the USSR by leaving it against the wishes of the majority of Soviet citizens. Russia is the richest country in the region. The countries of the former USSR are to Russia as South America is to the USA in terms of migration. If there is a reunion today. It would not be with the wishes of Russia and they will be the losers. On a side note. Last elections Moldova voted in a pro Russian government. Even with the dispute in Transnistria. So are there any former Soviet republics that would want to voluntary unify with Russia? No. Nor does Russia. Are there countries that want stronger economic and military ties with Russia? Yes almost all of them. It is Russia that is writing all the limitation. See the Euroasian economic union. Quick mention to some countries of the former eastern block that are increasingly getting friendly with Russia to the annoyance of the west. Bulgaria voted in a pro Russian government. Hungary, Czechs and Slovak are getting friendly. Is Russia annexing them too? ",

            "answer_text": " At this point Belarus is the only former Soviet republic which has a realistic chance of reintegrating with Russia. The likelihood of that happening in the next decade is roughly 50/50. Alexander Lukashenko has had a tremendous run at the helm of Belarus for 25 years, and he hasn\u2019t been in the mood to share his political power with the Russian President. The future of reintegration with Russia will hinge largely on Lukashenko\u2019s retirement plans and how much Russia will be willing to offer for Belarus to give up its sovereignty. It\u2019s a realistic scenario but it would not be a simple one for either side. There are other remote reintegration possibilities as well. Donetsk and Lugansk, the two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, still hang in the balance of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It is conceivable that they would reintegrate into Russia either in the short-term or in the distant future depending on how the negotiations and the conflict unfold. Transnistria, the breakaway region of Moldova, has been asking for a long time to be reintegrated into Russia. While that does not seem possible in the near future, it is something that could occur eventually if Moldova fails to reach a compromise with the region. Then there are the two breakaway regions of Georgia \u2014 South Ossetia and Abkhazia which also could conceivably join Russia at some point in the future if the Russian-Georgian relations collapse. If the Russian economy suddenly picks up steam, and Russia pulls off an economic miracle over the next decade or two, more reintegration possibilities would emerge. This does not appear likely at this point, but much can change in the next 5 or 10 years. Russia could conceivably once again become a magnet for surrounding countries if it plays its cards right. ",
