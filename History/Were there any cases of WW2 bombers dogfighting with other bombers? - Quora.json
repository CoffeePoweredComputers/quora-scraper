            "answer_text": "When my dad first arrived in England as a co-pilot on B-17 bombers, one of the first things they did was called familiarization flights. They would fly around the local area to memorize landmarks etc., so if they came home in foggy or cloudy weather (quite common) they were able to recognize scenery and find a way home. As they were preparing to land after one of these flights, on final approach, a small British advanced trainer called a Miles Master buzzed over the top of them, missing by maybe 30\u2032 with an overtake speed about 50mph faster. Just a young British flying flying cadet out joyriding. Dad's pilot said \u201cWatch this\u201d and cobbed all four throttles to maximum manifold pressure, then retracted the gear and flaps. The B-17G was designed to carry up to 6,000 lbs of bombs, 13 machine guns with hundreds of rounds of ammo each, 10 crew members and enough fuel to fly to Berlin and back, at altitudes up to about 25,000\u2032. For this flight they had five crew members, no bombs, no machine guns or ammo, and had enough fuel left for about 40 minutes. Plus they were barely above sea level. All this meant that the performance was VERY sporty. They rapidly gained on the Miles Master, and the cadet must have been very surprised to see this enormous four-engine American bomber closing in on him. First he tried climbing to evade, they easily out climbed him. Then he tried a sharp turn. Although the longer-span bomber took longer to bank into the turn, once they were banked they easily turned inside the turn radius of the trainer. For about three minutes they chased that hapless cadet all over the airfield. Finally the cadet climbed to about 2,000\u2032 altitude, rolled inverted and performed a Split S. Dad's pilot looked over at him and said \u201cWe're not going to do that.\u201d ",

Several of the better performing twin-engine medium bombers were co-opted successfully into the heavy-fighter role or could at least give a good account of themselves if jumped, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be quite the question at hand.
