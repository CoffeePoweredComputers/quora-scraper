            "answer_text": "The revolutionary war was partly, and mostly fought because of slavery, the Somerset Case in England in 1772 found that Slavery had never been authorized by statute in England and Wales, and Lord Mansfield's decision found it also unsupported in common law. Lord Mansfield narrowly limited his judgment to the issue of whether a person, regardless of being a slave, could be removed from England against his will, and said he could not. The decision was that property rights in chattel slaves were unsupported by Common law. Some historians believe the case contributed to increasing colonial support for separatism in the 13 colonies of North America, who wanted to establish independent government and law. The southern colonies wanted to protect slavery and expanded their territory dramatically in the decades after independence was won. Slavery in England and Wales was already extremely rare since Norman times, the 12th century. Contemporary writers noted that the Scottish and Welsh took captives as slaves during raids, a practice which was no longer common in England by the 12th century. However, by the start of the 13th century references to people being taken as slaves stopped. While there was no legislation against slavery and Wales, William the Conqueror, introduced a law preventing the sale of slaves overseas. According to historian John Gillingham by about 1200 slavery in the British Isles was non-existent. The Portuguese, in the 16th century, were the first to engage in the Atlantic slave trade. In 1526, they completed the first transatlantic slave voyage to Brazil, and other Europeans soon followed. Shipowners regarded the slaves as cargo to be transported to the Americas as quickly and cheaply as possible, there to be sold to work on coffee, tobacco, cocoa, sugar, and cotton plantations, gold and silver mines, rice fields, the construction industry, cutting timber for ships, in skilled labour, and as domestic servants. While the first Africans kidnapped to the English colonies were classified as indentured servants with a similar legal standing as contract-based workers coming from Britain and Ireland, by the middle of the 17th century, slavery had hardened as a racial caste, with African slaves and their future offspring being legally the property of their owners, as children born to slave mothers were also slaves. Who continued to being the slaves? Well, the same people as before, the Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch and French\u2026 ",

Britain signed a treaty recognizing the independence of the United States at the end of the Revolutionary War. So yes, Britain \u201cgave up\u201d on controlling the United States. But the slave trade still existed, and was run by private slave traders, British, American, Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch. And so the newly independent American states continued to buy slaves from these traders. What do those two, completely unrelated, facts have to do with one another? ",
