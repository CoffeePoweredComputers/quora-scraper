            "answer_text": "That is a real mystery, this holes are very old and perhaps were used to storage grain, other theory is as a grave however they don't have a cover, I like this theory: as you may know the city of Pisco is in a valley (by the river of Pisco), however only one side of the valley is fertile, the other side is locked in a huge desert full of sands. Perhaps, they try in some kind of desesperation to storage water (by rain), it's a desert, it does not rain in the area easily, but maybe in the past, the weather was different, perhaps they entered a time with a lot of raining, so they started to make the holes to storage the water right away. You can see similar holes for this in Nazca city (near Nazca lines), explore the area with Google Earth. ",
