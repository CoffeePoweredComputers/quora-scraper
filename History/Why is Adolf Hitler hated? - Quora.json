            "answer_text": "Because he brought the world into its second largest conflict within a century. As leader of the Nazi party, Hitler\u2019s policies caused one of the largest genocides to take place, as well as causing the deaths of both Allied and Axis soldiers, and millions of innocent civilians in their own homes. Because of Hitler\u2019s actions, The Holocaust took place. Yes, anti-semitism was widespread within Europe, and had been for centuries, but it was under Hitler that this came to fruition, as murder was committed on a scale never before seen. 11 million people died in the concentration and death camps, 6 million of which were Jewish, but the rest just as innocent. Millions of young men lost their lives fighting through Europe and Asia as a result of war being declared. Though in some parts not in the same scale as the First World War, they still gave their lives as a result of Hitler believing in Germanic supremacy. Although the Allies were arguably responsible for causing the poor conditions in Europe after WW1 that led to Hitler\u2019s rise to power, Hitler was still the man who brought Europe\u2019s peace to a halt. Because of Hitler\u2019s arrogance, even in defeat he refused to give up. Children were forced to fight in Berlin as the Allies drew in, raised in ideology that made Hitler almost god-like. German soldiers raped their way through Eastern Europe, committing atrocities to those they believed to be lesser than themselves. Hitler had sent these troops into this new Lebensraum, and so they wanted revenge. In short, Adolf Hitler is disliked because of all the actions, committed by himself and on behalf of him, that led to millions of innocent people dying. Often, this was for no fault other than that they had been born different. He is hated because he is seen as a figure of evil, \u2018the devil incarnate\u2019, who brought about one of the worst periods of history. ",

            "answer_text": "Because they\u2019ve been brainwashed by years of liberal propaganda from the media, parents, friends and books. I\u2019m not saying that Hitler was a good guy but he did good things just as he did bad things, and it\u2019s unfair to talk just about bad things. There\u2019s a stigma in society about Hitler and national socialism, while Castro, Lenin,Stalin, communism, marxism and socialism are being praised on every corner. The truth is that Stalin killed more of his own people than Hitler. While 6 million people died during the holocaust (not even Hitler\u2019s idea, but Himmlers and Reinhard T.G Heydrichs. And the \u201c6 million\u201d thing is actually highly debatable and many historians are discussing that matter, the chances are that there\u2019s significantly less victims), those were all of Hitler\u2019s \u201cenemies\u201d such as jews, gypsies, gays, the disabled, enemies of the state etc. combined, while Stalin caused the deaths of so many people, his own people, that the numbers are still being discussed, but are estimated to be around 10+ million and that is not counting the german/polish civilians murdered by the Red Army nor is it counting the Holodomor (which killed about 3 to 3.5 million people, and at it\u2019s peak at 1933 it caused about 17 deaths per minute)And the death toll didn\u2019t stop there, it\u2019s also not counting the deaths caused by Stalin\u2019s policies in soviet occupied Germany. All in all, to conclude my rant, people hate Hitler because they are programmed to do so ever since they could think. Their judgement has been bent by force and has been clouded by the lies which were planted deep inside of their heads But as they say, history is written by victors. ",
