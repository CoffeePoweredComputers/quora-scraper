            "answer_text": "Of course, there are people who have ancestry that comes from both the Jews and Moors/Arabs who lived there. That\u2019s a minority of the ancestry in Spain. Some last names come from the Jews like Perez, Toledano, Laredo. For names that connect to Muslims I would say: Alvarez, Almodovar, Alvarado. When you\u2019re talking about descendants, we\u2019re talking about people who don\u2019t follow Islam or Judaism and mixed in with the rest of the population and became Catholics and married other Catholics in Spain.

But I don\u2019t think you have Muslim Spaniards who continuously lived in Spain since the Inquisition time while retaining their Islamic faith. I think all the Muslims who stayed in Spain eventually became Christians. ",
