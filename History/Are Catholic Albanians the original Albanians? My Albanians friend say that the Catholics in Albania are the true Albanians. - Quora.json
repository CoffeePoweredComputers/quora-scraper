            "answer_text": "I am going to pretend you didn\u2019t use the phrase \u2018true Albanians\u2019, because confession doesn\u2019t determine what a \u2018true\u2019 Albanian is. All Albanians, whatever they may believe in, are \u2018true\u2019 Albanians. Concerning the first part of your question, wether catholicism is the \u2018original\u2019 as in \u2018first\u2019 christian confession of Albanians: In theory, yes. But it\u2019s more complicated than just saying \u2018yes\u2019 here: Catholicism and Orthodoxy split into two separate confessions only with the Great Schism in 1054, in which the Byzantine Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church split from each other. During the Great Schism, practically all Albanians were orthodox, due to centuries of Byzantine rule. Albanians were already christianized way before that though - under Roman rule before the 5. Century. So the first Albanian non-pagan religion was neither Catholic nor Orthodox, as neither existed back then. It was simply Christianity. And at the point of Catholicism and Orthodoxy spliting into separate confessions, Albanians were following the Byzantine rite of Orthodoxy.There is a catch though: in antiquity, during the Roman rule in the Balkans (roughly 150BC-450AD), the Balkans were split between a Latin speaking and a Greek speaking area of influence. The line dividing both is called \u2018Jire\u010dek line\u2019, and goes through the middle of Albania, along the Shkumbin river. The two Albanian main dialects, Tosk and Gheg, split at this exact line too - between Eastern Greek and Western Roman influence. At the same time, Christianity before the Great Schism was already kind-of split between a Latin speaking Roman-rite and a Greek-speaking Byzantine rite. The split between these rites may be what caused the Albanian dialect split.Before the Tosk-Gheg split in the 5. Century, Albanians were influenced far stronger by the Latin West than from the Greek East, which expresses itself in 60% Latin loanwords in the modern Albanian language. That means: Albanians originate north of the Jire\u010dek line. Many of the latin loans are pre-christian, again showing that the modern, partly romanized Albanian language originates north of the Jire\u010dek line in Western Roman influence. And if the first christianization of Albanians preceded the Tosk-Gheg split, the latin-speaking Roman rite of christianity, the predecessor of Catholizism if you like, is the original form of christianity among Albanians - Albanians were taught christianity in latin and not in greek, and the Albanian christianity was originally in the Roman rite - the early form of catholicism.Now we have to keep in mind, that this early Roman \u2018version\u2019 of christianity does not equal Catholicism, and scholars are not 100% sure if the christianization of Albanians really preceded the Tosk-Gheg split. If that is not the case, Southern Albanians would be originally \u2018Byzantine\u2019-christian and northern Albanians \u2018Rome\u2019-christian, as Tosks and Ghegs took the respective forms of christianity of their zone of influence. In the end, whether Catholizism or Orthodoxy, both are a result of two European powers tearing the Albanians into different directions. Early Catholizism is technically the first Albanian monotheistic confession, but today that bears no meaning, aside from being a historical curiosity. ",

Albania definition is AL - BA - NIA = HIGH, MADE, THAT ONE, I don't know the real interpretation of HIGH is that for high elevation or high quality race and they ruled the world for very long time thousands of years since the discovery of farming which we know very little about it. I bet you if any documentation exists should sits in the archives of Vatican or the Orthodox church. The movement for social changes started some four thousands of years ago and concluded with the Roman empire. After the power change they made sure to destroy the past including the MOTHER LANGUAGE which was with us since the beginning of times. They even killed Cesar which was an ALBAN and wanted to continue the old tradition and now they justify that by saying he was a dictator. Im not trying to promote racism or anything I truly believe in one race human but the newcomers couldn't stand the white race and the white power which created the greatest civilization ever unknown. You may say none sense because the future monarchs were white as well and that is true. The opportunity represented itself and some people made the deal with the devil but this time was different. The power was completely in the hands of the POPE. And they tried to murder this precious tongue and they almost did by inventing thousands of new ones everywhere and thanks to the heroics of the Albanian people who by nature will never neel to anyone she survived. That's the Catholicism to make you feel proud Albanian Catholics. We say Albanian religion is Albania and that's the way it should be. We have to keep our eyes open because someone never sleeps plating what to do next. They are so obsessed with the power and want to control every bit of our lives which they actually do. They accusing that guy Assange for treason just for telling the TRUTH. We need the truth today and transparency, we're tired of conspiracies and classified stuff. That is the only way we can live in PEACE and gain each other's trust back. ",
