            "answer_text": "Several clarifications: 1st, it was not technically a \u201cwar\u201d but a \u201cPolice Action\u201d agreed to by the United Nations - The USSR had absented themselves on another motion - and were not present to vote on a veto declaration; 2nd, America did not lose the war. It ended in a cease fire pretty well where it started - on the 38th parallel, known as the DMZ or demilitarized zone. Initially, the small American force, along with ROK (Republic of Korea) forces were suddenly attacked by the North Koreans and pushed back to small area around the southern coast of the country, called Pusan which perimeter held, while General MacArthur concocted a risky but successful amphibious landing by American troops at Inchon, near the South Korean Capital of Seoul. (The General attributed his Plan to General Wolfe, whose troops unexpectedly climbed cliff faces behind the French garrison at Quebec City to win New France for the English on the \u201cFields of Abraham\u201d.) MacArthur\u2019s troops than raced eastward to cut off the North Korean troops from retreat, communications and supplies, and other columns quickly raced northwards, the U.S. Army and Marines reaching the Chosen Reservoir on the Yalu River across from Manchuria, when suddenly some 120,000 Chinese troops crossed the River, with blaring bugles, forcing the UN troops engaging in a heroic struggle over several severe winter months, a large number of whom made their retreat about 100 miles to Hungnam on the Sea of Japan, where they were evacuated, with many refugees and heavy equipment and taken to the Pusan area. The United Nation troops, including the American, were forced back to a solid defense line at the 38th Parallel, where the action was reduced to an attrition zone; the result being that a large number of Chinese troops were killed until a cease fire was agreed upon. So, the Peace Action was not lost by the UN troops, including the Americans; no real estate was lost and the South, with about 2/3rds the population of the Peninsula, went on to prosper as a very modern country, heavy in industry and preserving its culture with a high degree of education and employment compared with the North, which is suffering under a grim and harsh dictatorship.

            "answer_text": "The USA didn\u2019t lose the Korean War. Among other issues, it wasn\u2019t an American war to win or lose. That war was fought between the United Nations, on one side, with the South Koreans and Americans providing the larger share of the UN forces, and, on the other size, an alliance of North Korean forces and Chinese \u201cvolunteers.\u201d The Korean War is considered a draw by most observers because the border between North Korea and South Korea was finally settled along a ceasefire line roughly similar to the original boundary between the Soviet and American occupation zones set in 1945. More then anything else, the war was a tragic stalemate. Korea is still divided after 67 years. The Republic of Korea is prosperous and as well off as any First World nation. North Korea is half-starved and a relic of Stalinist totalitarianism, an international pariah that constantly threatens to make war on South Korea and on the United States, South Korea\u2019s most prominent ally.  The People\u2019s Republic of China did well in the war, establishing itself as the winner of the Chinese Civil War and capable of defending that victory against the outside world. The United States, which had been slowly demobilizing its military since 1945, stumbled into the role of protector of Western interests in East Asia and enforcer of the United Nation charter and the international system it represents. It accepted that role, for good or ill, and still \u201cplays cop\u201d in East Asia today. ",
