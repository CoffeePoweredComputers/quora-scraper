            "answer_text": "I think George III understood there was an insurgency, but felt it was limited to just Boston until things got out of hand. I\u2019m going to go a little tangent here because I want to. Contrary to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s \u2018fake news\u2019, George III was not a tyrant. He wanted to reign in accordance with British Constitutional principles. One such principle is that he acted on the advice of his ministers. A second was that he could not ignore the laws passed by Parliament and signed by him or his predecessors. Everything the British government did was legal under the British system and the Colonials knew it. Every one of them or their ancestors who got on boat in Britain and headed for North America knew they would no longer have direct representation in the British Parliament. It was all very clear. As a Constitutional monarch, George III was bound to enforce the law. He may have agreed with the law but his duty was clear. One of the reasons he agreed with his minister\u2019s decisions was what I like to call Washington Screwup. In 1754, a group of Virginia elites decided they could make some money speculating on some land. The problem was that the land was on the then French side of the border around what is now Pittsburgh but populated mostly Native Americans. So, they sent young George Washington out with the Virginia Militia to kill the Natives and take their land. Unfortunately, Washington\u2019s barely armed force ran into a lot of Natives backed up by regular French troops armed with artillery. Washington got his rear kicked all the way back home. The Virginia elites hid under the beds and wrote letters to George II begging for Mother England\u2019s protection. A global war broke out where France, Spain, Russia, and others went to war against Britain. After 7 year of fighting, Britain won but was nearly bankrupt. It was a very close run thing. Also, George II died and his grandson George III ascended to the throne. And if you\u2019re living in Britain, you\u2019re thinking why are we paying all the bills to defend the Americans, especially when they started a war without permission. See the irony in Trump\u2019s anti-NATO stance. Anyway, there were taxes already on the books from the beginning of the colonization which every colonist knew was there. Britain just was lax about collecting them. Also, tax wise, only the really wealthy were paying anything that bothered them, and even then, it was 1/10 the rate, thereabouts, of what their countrymen with representation were paying. Also, in part because of what Washington did, the British government drew a line at the Appalachians, where the old border was, that said that past that line Americans could no longer kill Natives and steal their land. They were tired of American colonists starting wars without permission. On a side note, the British courts outlawed Slavery in the British Isles, and it was a matter of time before it spread. So, George III may have blamed his ministers but he also agreed with them to an extent. To me, I think George looked at the Americans like a parent looks at a teenager who borrowed the family car, wrecked it, and balked at paying for the damages out of his own pocket. Calling mom an dad tyrants. I think George thought that Americans wanted teenager liberty, freedom without responsibility. ",

            "answer_text": "The Hanovers always deferred to Parliament. After the Glorious Revolution (1688) and the Act of Settlement of 1701 in favor of the Hanovers, the king of Great Britain was a constitutional monarch very much subordinate to Parliament in political matters. His personal opinion of the Americans just did not matter. Certainly, the American Whigs would have loved it if George III had accepted an offer of a crown from an American parliament and created a personal union under George III with the Kingdom of Great Britain similar to those that had from time to time existed in Scotland and Ireland; but that was never a realistic possibility and the Americans knew it. There was no daylight between the king and Parliament on matters of national policy at anytime after 1714. Between the first Walpole ministry (1721) and the end of the Pelham-Holles ministry (1762) the overall policy of Parliament had been to treat the American colonies as partners, allies or puppets in matters concerning foreign relations. That changed with ministry of George Grenville (1763\u201365) and continued through the ministry of Fredrick, Lord North (1770\u201382) when the overall policy of Parliament was to look at the American Colonies as a source of revenue like the East India Company. This was the beginning of the second British Empire while the American colonies were the crown jewel of the first English Empire and the Interregnum of 1649\u201360. In Great Britain, the Wilkesites complicated the situation because the Wilkesites were radical Whigs (very much like the American Whigs) centered in London who were in formal opposition to the Tory ministries of Blute, Grenville and North between 1763\u20131780. John Wilkes, himself, was the radical Whig Lord Mayor of London after 1774. Nick Bunker\u2019s \u201cAn Empire on the Edge\u201d (2015) is very good on British politics and the American Revolution after 1750 and through 1782. ",
