            "answer_text": "With several of the \"Silk Road\" markets shut down, one may wonder who has \"stepped up\" and taken their place. To be honest, there are plenty of darknet markets that are currently running, and while they may not have the number of customers that the Silk Road did, they seem to be successfully doing business. Currently, there is a site going by the name of Silk Road 3.0 (although I believe it previously had a different name).  Beyond the former, these are a few other examples:  Atlantis MarketplaceKamagra for BitcoinsEuCanna - \"First Class Cannabis Healthcare\" Peoples Drug StoreSmokeablesBrainmagicNLGrowersAlphabayBlack Market ReloadedDream MarketNucleus MarketOutlaw MarketEast India CompanyAgora MarketplaceAbraxas MarketCrypto MarketMiddle Earth MarketplaceDr. D's Multilingual MarketplaceJust about all of these sell their goods for bitcoin, although some occasionally take cash or PayPal as well.  I haven't personally purchased goods from any of these markets, so I can't truly give an opinion about which are better or worse, but that's where word-of-mouth comes in.   Some may ask why I'm \"promoting\" these sites on Quora, so just to be clear: I'm neither promoting nor condemning them.  While yes, you can purchase drugs and pharmaceuticals from all of these, there is always risk involved.   Firstly, you don't necessarily know with whom you're dealing, and secondly, you don't necessarily know if the goods are pure or not.  Most people who buy these kinds of things on the dark web already know the risks.  That aside, if you want to be one of their customers, I won't stop you!    ",
