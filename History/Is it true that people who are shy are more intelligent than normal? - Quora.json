            "answer_text": "It's Always The Quiet Ones: People Who Talk Less Really Are Smarter It's easy to assume that the most outspoken, opinionated person in the room is the most intelligent. In fact, this isn't always the case.The people who are the most intelligent are actually the ones you'd least expect to be smart. They patiently wait for other people to say what they need to say. They choose to open their ears rather than their mouths.The quietest people are the smartest people; the ones who talk less have the most brainpower. Go figure. These are the introverts. They're the creative types, the geniuses who get stimulation from learning rather than socializing. You may not have noticed them. They prefer to fly under the radar, silently producing the best work and the most incredible art. It\u2019s always the quiet ones who turn out to be the most interesting and surprising, isn't it? Quiet people are too busy thinking to talk. The quitest people are the ones inside their heads. They're chronic over-thinkers. They may want to start a conversation, but they're busy thinking about that conversation's possible outcomes.They dissect every single factor in a conversation. Speaking doesn't come easily, as they take it very seriously. Quiet people may have a lot to say, but they have trouble forming actual words because they're moving from one subject to the next inside their heads. Quiet people write and read more than they speak. Quiet, intelligent people focus their energy on creating. They aren't spending their free time out at the bar; they're spending it reading and writing. Introverts enjoy stimulating conversations, but it is safe to say that these are few and far between. It's the quiet ones who are sitting in their libraries, reading and lounging on their couches, writing and creating.

            "answer_text": "This is not necessary. Shyness, introvertness and silence are different traits. Intelligently matured people prefer silence quite more. Though when intelligent people working on strengthening their intellect, they may be highly talkative but as degree of maturity increases, they work through silence as deep intelligence is the state of deep feeling. Deep feeling state is not possible without deep silence. Shyness at times may be because of low self esteem, lack of something and may be because of few other life conditions. But still lot of intelligent people are shy in nature though they seem shy in social situations but not where their intellect has to play big role. Likewise, introvertness is the state of inner awareness. Introverts could be highly imaginative and dreamy kind of people also where they may be lost in their dreams and might be lazy or procrastinating in their nature. But still most of inventors and to some extent innovators are highly introverts. ",
