            "answer_text": "People in the ancient world did not have as many changes of clothing as we do now, and sometimes outer garments were not easily washable, By wearing a layer of cloth between their bodies and their outer garment, they kept the latter from absorbing sweat and dirt from the body, keeping it cleaner and helping it last much longer. This tradition persisted to the middle of last century, when men typically wore undershirts and women full slips, to protect their outer garments. ",

            "answer_text": "People started wearing underwear because clothes were made of fabrics that couldn\u2019t be washed that often or were difficult to clean, or they were harsh and itchy, whereas underwear could me made of a lighter fabric that was easier to wash and softer on the skin. The purpose of underwear is to both protect clothes from sweat, smells and stains, and to protect the body from friction with clothes or other external agents. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re wearing pants. Your underwear protects your private parts from rubbing all day against the seams. You also can change and wash your underwear more often than your outer garments so it protects your garment from smells and stains from possible little accidents. ",
