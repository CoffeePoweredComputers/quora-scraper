            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by witches? If you mean crones with warts on their noses who flew on broomsticks and mated with the devil I would say most certainly not. If however you mean women who were knowledgable in the lore of herbs and their medicinal uses then I would say yes. That doesn't mean that they were all good. I\u2019ve no doubt that just as in todays world their were some who used their knowledge for criminal purposes or revenge but generally witch trials are the result of prejudice and ignorance. A good example of this ignorance are the Salem witch trials which occurred as a result of the fungus ergot growing on grain. This produced an effect similar to LSD giving \u201cvisions\u201d. Ergot was also used in aborting unwanted children. The difference was the dosage. It's not surpring that an overdose of ergot caused the body to go into spasm and horrific visions. Add to this the cruel means of extracting a \u201cconfession\u201d such as crushing the feet, or using branding irons the conviction rate was high. Remember asprin was first discovered as a tincture made from the bark of the willow tree. How extraordinary that a women steeped in herb law should be able reduce the temperature of an ill child just by giving a drink containing willow bark. In an age when medicinal science still taught that illness was caused by the 4 humours (earth, air, fire and water) and that bloodletting and purges were the norm for treating illnesses its hardly surprising that herbalists were treatedwith suspicion ",

            "answer_text": "Not as such, no. There were peasants who had some odd beliefs and some people who used quasi-magical incantations and prayers alongside herbal medicine, but for most of the period this kind of behaviour was just treated as typical superstitions of the ignorant and no-one in authority really cared. However some clergy managed to get themselves so worked up over heretical sects who challenged their authority like the Waldensians and Fraticelli that they convinced themselves that such people were worshipping the devil. And then it got nasty and paranoid, with witchfinders instituting reigns of terror, grand conspiracies of covens being concocted and the devil being seen at work all over the place. The serious mass persecution of alleged witches really took hold in the 1500s. \u2018Europe\u2019s Inner Demons\u2019 by Norman Cohn is an excellent account of how the image of the \u2018witch\u2019 developed over the period - ironically it was ultimately based on polemics against the pernicious new sect of \u2018Christians\u2019 written by pagan Roman authors - and the growth of genuinely threatening religious discord in the form of the growth of Protestantism led to mass hysteria among Europe\u2019s best educated people. Up until this point they generally really had known better than to take such superstitious tosh seriously, but for a period in the 16th century they saw a witch under every bed and took brutal measures to fight the imagined threat. Later outbreaks of witch trials in the 17th century likewise owed more to the political dislocation of the times than any real witchcraft. ",
