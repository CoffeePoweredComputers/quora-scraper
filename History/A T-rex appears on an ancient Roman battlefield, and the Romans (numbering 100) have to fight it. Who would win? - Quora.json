            "answer_text": "The bigger question is what do the Romans do with it once it's dead. There would be terror but if they could keep their discipline, then the Romans would have no problem in defeating the T-Rex. Before it got close it would be pierced with enough javelins and arrows to seriously wound it. It might just get close enough to take a chomp out of a few and stomp on a few others, but whilst it's doing that it will be hacked to pieces. If it just appears out of nowhere I suspect 20 soldiers would be sufficient. If they know its coming you can probably half that again or even less and probably take it alive. People like to underestimate just how amazing hunters we are. We are far and away the greatest predators that have ever lived. ",

Each Roman legionnaire has two spears\u2026which they are trained to use as hurling weapons against an enemy. 100 Roman soldiers, therefore, has 200 such spears\u2026few of which would miss a target as large as a T-rex. In fact, a smart Roman commander, such as Julius Caesar\u2026would detail a smaller number\u2026to let fly their spears\u2026and assess the results. Even ten men, using twenty such spears\u2026could seriously injure\u2026if not kill outright, the dinosaur\u2026leaving 90 men with their spears intact to repeat the process, in relays, if necessary. A T-rex is a fearsome predator\u2026 but against trained soldiers\u2026even if armed with only spears, swords, and shields, it dies! ",
