            "answer_text": "First things first. We can eliminate one of the contenders right off the bat:  While Washington has possibly the strongest legacy of the four, he was an above-average general, and that\u2019s being charitable. The other three are all military geniuses. This is a no-contest in terms of pure aptitude, somewhat akin to putting your high school track star up against Usain Bolt. I trust Washington with the humility and good sense to know how outmatched he is in this conflict, and step down gracefully.  From here, we\u2019re into some very, very, very steep competition. Between Alexander, Caesar, and Napoleon, any of the three has a fair shot of being the best. Not the best of the three. The best military leader in history, period. That being said, I think there\u2019s a clear forerunner. For the sake of drama, I\u2019ll leave his name unspoken, though process of elimination will certainly spoil that. Regardless, for the second place spot (and by far the hardest to call), we have:  Both of these commanders are so similar in so many ways. They both existed in a similar period of history, they both had similarly unstoppable armies during their day. In fact, they both won pretty much all the battles they fought (I count Dyrrhachium as a Caesar victory despite his retreat due to the immense casualties he inflicted on Pompey). The big problem here is assessing Alexander. He only ever fought in nine battles, but each of them was against such overwhelming odds as to be worthy of a legend in its own right. So it\u2019s possible that Alexander simply got lucky against incompetent opponents, and it\u2019s equally possible that he was just flexing and hadn\u2019t even begun to tap his limitless potential. This is entirely a personal call, but I\u2019m siding with Caesar here. Alexander simply does not have enough data for me to say with any confidence that he\u2019d win here. Still, some of you may be wondering how we\u2019re going UP from here. After all, if both Alexander and Caesar were virtually undefeated during their careers, how can I say for sure that anyone was better.  On that note, let me introduce the one remaining candidate:  To start, Napoleon has the unfair advantage of being the latest chronologically. He had plenty of time to study the other three, and even wrote a biography of Caesar. Not only does he know their tactics, their strategies, their maneuvers, he knows them as people. Napoleon has a clear handicap in this game. But, personally, I doubt it will matter. Frankly, I don\u2019t think Napoleon needs the help. I don\u2019t really know what to say here, except that even among the absolute best generals of all time, Napoleon is simply a head and shoulders above the rest. They say a picture is worth a thousand words. How about a chart:  Look at the victories, how many they were. Look at the defeats, see how few they were. I had to scroll down just to find the first one. Look at all the flags of all the kingdoms that tried to take Napoleon down, and simply couldn\u2019t. Sardinia, Hapsburg, Malta, Egypt, the Ottomans, Prussia all fell without taking a single battle off l'Empereur. Coalitions of two, three, four countries teamed up to try to take him down. He was outnumbered two-to-one over and over and over\u2026 and kept winning. But Alexander and Caesar had similar win/loss records. What makes Napoleon different? I\u2019m glad you asked. It\u2019s one small fact: Napoleon won these battles against generals who were themselves of Caesar\u2019s and Alexander\u2019s caliber. This wasn\u2019t a few victories against a cowardly Darius or his incompetent satraps. This isn\u2019t pub-stomping barbarian tribes in Gaul. These are fully-fledged nations, powers in their own right, professional armies led by trained and tested generals, and Napoleon made them all look like amateurs. No, that\u2019s not fair. He made them look like playground schoolkids. I think the most fitting epitaph for l'Empereur comes from his greatest rival, Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington. Wellington, himself a top-10 general, is the one who finally brought Napoleon down at the battle of Waterloo. He had 118,000 men to Napoleon\u2019s 73,000, a better position, and time on his side. Afterwards, he remarked: [Waterloo was] the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life \u2026 By God! I don't think it would have been done if I had not been there. Yeah, you heard him right. Wellington, himself one of the top 10 generals in all history, is famous for squeaking out a victory over Napoleon while \u2018only\u2019 outnumbering him by 45,000 men.  It reminds me of a story from Livy\u2019s History of Rome:  \u201c[Scipio] Africanus asked who, in Hannibal\u2019s opinion, was the greatest general of all time. Hannibal replied: \u2018Alexander, King of the Macedonians, because with a small force he routed armies of countless numbers, and because he traversed the remotest lands. Merely to visit such lands transcended human expectation.\u2019 Asked whom he would place second, Hannibal said: \u2018Pyrrhus. He was the first to teach the art of laying out a camp. Besides that, no one has ever shown nicer judgement in choosing his ground, or in disposing his forces. He also had the art of winning men to his side; so that the Italian peoples preferred the overlordship of a foreign king to that of the Roman people, who for so long had been the chief power in that country.\u2019 When Africanus followed up by asking whom he ranked third, Hannibal unhesitatingly chose himself. Scipio burst out laughing at this, and said: \u2018What would you have said if you had defeated me?\u2019 \u2018In that case\u2019, replied Hannibal, \u2018I should certainly put myself before Alexander and before Pyrrhus \u2013 in fact, before all other generals!\u2019 This reply, with its elaborate Punic subtlety, and this unexpected kind of flattery\u2026affected Scipio deeply, because Hannibal had set him (Scipio) apart from the general run of commanders, as one whose worth was beyond calculation.\u201d THAT is how good Napoleon was. Even with his own impressive military career, even with the advantage in numbers, even with how nail-bitingly close it came in the end, the highest compliment Wellington could pay himself was to say that he was the one who finally beat Napoleon.  I\u2019ll end with a neat little tidbit. A few years ago, Ethan Arsht, a data scientist, decided to apply the same sabermetric analysis used to assess professional baseball players, to over 6600 generals. For each battle that each general fought, his rating would go up or down based on the skill of his opponent and the relative military advantages they had going into that battle (more numbers, better geography, etc). Here are all 6600 generals graphed:  The vertical axis is how much experience they had (number of battles). The horizontal axis is how good they are. Washington is in red, Alexander, yellow. Caesar is purple. But guess who is all the way out there in the top right? Napoleon was the Best General Ever, and the Math Proves it. PS- Wellington, the man who, on his best day dreamed of taking on Napoleon, has the dot right next to Caesar\u2019s. As I said, a head and shoulders above. ",

Hard to challenge\u2026 Let\u2019s look at each of them. Napoleon played until he was the winner and he even picked his adversaries on purpose ( the ones he can beat). A detailed source at: Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte He was like a spoiled child when it comes to games\u2026 A lover of chess game like Washington.  The Bertrand game was given on pages 120-121 of James Mason\u2019s 1900 book Social Chess with this concluding comment: \u2018\u2019A brilliant ending. This game has been recorded as one of many played by Napoleon v Marshal Bertrand, at St Helena, in or about 1820 \u2026 The Great Captain was also a great lover of chess, and practiced it, always on occasion, from his early youth to the last days of his life.\u2019\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: Napoleon Bonaparte and Chess by Edward Winter Alexander the Great On the other hand , Alexander was a pragmatist.. He cut the ropes he supposed to untie by hand. He did not play the games by rules ..Or he changed the rules\u2026 \u2018\u2019The term \u201cGordian knot,\u201d commonly used to describe a complex or unsolvable problem, can be traced back to a legendary chapter in the life of Alexander the Great. As the story goes, in 333 B.C. the Macedonian conqueror marched his army into the Phrygian capital of Gordium in modern day Turkey. Upon arriving in the city, he encountered an ancient wagon, its yoke tied with what one Roman historian later described as \u201cseveral knots all so tightly entangled that it was impossible to see how they were fastened.\u201d Phrygian tradition held that the wagon had once belonged to Gordius, the father of the celebrated King Midas. An oracle had declared that any man who could unravel its elaborate knots was destined to become ruler of all of Asia. According to the ancient chronicler Arrian, the impetuous Alexander was instantly \u201cseized with an ardent desire\u201d to untie the Gordian knot. After wrestling with it for a time and finding no success, he stepped back from the mass of gnarled ropes and proclaimed, \u201cIt makes no difference how they are loosed.\u201d He then drew his sword and sliced the knot in half with a single stroke.\u2019\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: What Was the Gordian Knot?  Source of the picture: Apollo Capital \u2014 Crypto is Cutting the Gordian Knot of a Complex Financial System George Washington (b. 1732 \u2013 d. 1799) Washington was a gentleman when it comes to games. He was very interested in chess like British counterparts. An interesting anecdote: \u2018\u2019 Chess is credited with helping Washington to win a crucial battle in the Revolutionary War. On the night of December 25\u201326, 1776, General Washington crossed the Delaware River with his troops on the way to Trenton, New Jersey. The Hessian regiments, camped in and around Trenton, were attacked and decisively defeated by the American Continental Army. The Hessians had supposedly let their guard down to celebrate the Christmas holiday, and British commander, Colonel Johann Gottlieb Rall (also spelled Rahl) (c. 1726 \u2013 December 26, 1776) himself was misled by John Honeyman, a spy of Washington who convincingly posed as a loyalist. According to one account, Rall was busy playing chess (though some say cards) the night before the attack at the home of Trenton merchant Abraham Hunt when he was handed a note from a local Loyalist who\u2019d seen Washington\u2019s forces gathering. As not to be distracted from his game, Rall placed the unread note in his coat pocket. While leading his troops in retreat from the Battle of Trenton, Rall was struck by a musket ball. He died later that day from his injuries. The note informing the general of the attack was later found in his coat pocket. The Battle of Trenton is believed to be the turning point of the Revolutionary War.\u2019\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: Power in Check: Chess and the American Presidency  Intrigued by the sheer possibilities and intellectual pleasure, chess was played by many of the great leaders and thinkers including several of America\u2019s founding fathers such as Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. Source of he picture: Alpha Chess Academy Julius Caesar : A Game Changer, A man creating new rules for the games\u2026 Finally comes Caesar\u2026 He would be my winner in a sophisticated military boardgame. Caesar unlike others played with his own life in real time and he was expert on risk calculation under immense pressure. The pirate story tells much about him as well as his actions in Alesia, crossing Rubicon, fighting against incredible odds of Pompey etc\u2026 Going to Egypt with a small force and change the government\u2026 Great feats of strength and calculation under tremendous stress\u2026 Just one real life story \u2026 As the story is related in Plutarch\u2019s Parallel Lives, the capture was a minor inconvenience for Caesar but very bad luck for the pirates. \u2018\u2019 From the start, Caesar simply refused to behave like a captive. When the pirates told him that they had set his ransom at the sum of 20 talents, he laughed at them for not knowing who it was they had captured and suggested that 50 talents would be a more appropriate amount. He then sent his entourage out to gather the money and settled in for a period of captivity. The pirates must have been dumbfounded. It\u2019s not every day that a hostage negotiates his ransom up. Caesar made himself at home among the pirates, bossing them around and shushing them when he wanted to sleep. He made them listen to the speeches and poems that he was composing in his unanticipated downtime and berated them as illiterates if they weren\u2019t sufficiently impressed. He would participate in the pirates\u2019 games and exercises, but he always addressed them as if he were the commander and they were his subordinates. From time to time he would threaten to have them all crucified. They took it as a joke from their overconfident, slightly nutty captive. It wasn\u2019t a joke. After 38 days, the ransom was delivered and Caesar went free. Astonishingly, Caesar managed to raise a naval force in Miletus\u2014despite holding no public or military office\u2014and he set out in pursuit of the pirates. He found them still camped at the island where he had been held, and he brought them back as his captives. When the governor of Asia seemed to vacillate about punishing them, Caesar went to the prison where they were being held and had them all crucified.\u2019\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: The Time Julius Caesar Was Captured by Pirates  Source of the picture: Why Julius Caesar was the worst pirate prisoner ever Do not play with Caesar\u2026 His games are deadly\u2026 He plays for keeps..
