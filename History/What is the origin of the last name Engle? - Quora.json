            "answer_text": "It is an ancestral surname that goes back to the tribe that migrated from the Caucasus between 600 and 100 years BCE to settle in northern Germany/Denmark. Where they lived was called Angeln. When the Romans withdrew from Britannia in the 5th century to reinforce their army on the continent in the fight against Attila, Britannia\u2019s defences against raiding Irish, Caledonians (ie Picts) and Scots were greatly weakened, so the Briton King Vortigern invited Angles to Britannia as mercenaries. A later dispute over pay caused the Angles to go on the rampage, seizing land and driving the Britons westward. Thus the southeastern region of Britannia came to be known as Angle Land and eventually England. As for the meaning of Engle, my own opinion is that it is a dialectical variant of the word Eagle. EAG dissects as Ya-Ha-Ug (Great Sky Being. Compare it with simply Ha-Ug, which means Sky Being, which became the word Hawk), which was the ancient name given to eagles and which developed into the word for eagle in many otherwise completely different languages the world over, for example Ary-ol in Russian (similar across Slavic languages), Aquila in Latin, Arrano in Basque (even though Basque is said to be a unique language unrelated to any others), and Gol in Bengali. All completely different languages from completely different language groupings. In Chinese, another completely different language from a completely different language grouping, it is - notably - Ying. Note the NG sound in place of G. This is in line with my analysis that prior to migrating westwards, the Angles had mixed with oriental peoples, most probably through raiding and taking away women - women whose NG accentuation of the sounds G and GH would have had its effect on the children they bore for their Angle captors. Pre-Angle place names in England, for instance, are often suffixed with Ugh (which is short for Ha-Ug, or Gog, which means People in Celtic, because they were descended from Ha-Ug, whereas post-Angle place names end with Ing, just like in China. The other tribe of the steppe that was notorious for the same behaviour was the Mon-Gog (Sons Of Hawk), ie the Mongols. Unlike the Angles however, the Mongols continued to do so to such an extent that they came to look just like the Chinese. But in the language and customs of the Mongols can nevertheless still be found great similarities to the Angles. Thus, I class them and the Angles as brother tribes that originated in the Caucasus (Cauc comes from Ha-Ug), one of whom spread East and the other West. Note also the gene that causes faces to turn red after alcohol consumption. The gene is believed to have originated in China. So the fact that many Englishmen and indeed many other Europeans have this gene points very strongly to a migration into Europe of people who had prior to that been genetically mixing heavily with oriental peoples.

            "answer_text": "From Middle High German engel, from Old High German engil, from Proto-West Germanic *angil, borrowed from Latin angelus, itself from Ancient Greek \u1f04\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (\u00e1ngelos). Short form of given names beginning with Engel-, such as Engelbert. Also a nickname for someone with an angelic disposition, or for someone living in a house with a sign of an angel. Engelbert From Old High German. The first part has absorbed the tribal name Angle, and an extended form of the god's name Ing (as in Ingela), and was in Christian times interpreted as Engel (\u201can angel\u201d). The second part is beraht (\u201cbright\u201d). The element Ing(o)- was widely used in Germanic names from an early period; it is not clear whether it originally referred to the Ingaevones, or to the god Yngwi directly. Inguiomer was a relative of the Cheruscan Arminius in the first century. Ingundis was a wife of the Frankish king Chlothar I, whose son Charibert I married an Ingoberga (all in the sixth century). Other combinations such as masculine Inguin, Ingulf, Ingobald, feminine Inghildis, Ingedrudis, Ingoflidis, as well as the short forms Ingo (masculine) and Inga (feminine) are recorded in the early medieval period (seventh to ninth centuries). In Scandinavia and Germany, and areas where these groups settled, names beginning with Ing survived into modern usage, e.g.Ingmar, Ingvar, Ingvild, Ingeborg, Ingrid, Ingegerd and the family name Ingalls. Old Norse Yngvi as well as Old High German Inguin and Old English Ing\u01bfine are all derived from the Proto-Germanic *Ingwaz. Sound changes in late-Proto-Germanic transformed *Ingwaz into *Ingwi(z) in the nominative case and *Ingwin in the accusative case. That his epithet *Fraujaz appears in Old Norse compounds Ingvifreyr and Ingunarfreyr, as well as in Old English fr\u00e9a inguina, both of which mean 'Lord of the Inguins', i. e. the god Freyr, strongly indicates that the two deities are either the same or were syncretized at some very early period in the Germanic migration (or possibly before). The Ingvaeones, who occupied a territory roughly equivalent to modern Denmark, Frisia and the Low Countries at the turn of the millennium, were mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his Natural Histories as one of \"five Germanic tribes\". Tacitus asserts their descent from the three sons of Mannus or *Mannaz cognate with Manus in Hinduism , the 'first man', of whom *Ingwaz may have been one. Other names that retain the theonym are Inguiomerus or Ingemar and Yngling, the name of an old Scandinavian dynasty. Stripped of its Latin ending, the Ingvaeon are the Ingwine, \"friends of Ing\" familiar from Beowulf, where Hrothgaris \"Lord of the Ingwine\"\u2014whether one of them or lord over them being ambiguous. Ing, the legendary father of the Ingaevones/Ingvaeones derives his name from a posited proto-Germanic *Ingwaz, as Ing, Ingo or Inguio, son of Mannus.  ",
