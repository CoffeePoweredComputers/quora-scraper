            "answer_text": "Ketchup wasn\u2019t invented in 1876. Heinz created it\u2019s own version of Tomato Ketchup in 1876. And their recipe has certainly changed. Instead of sugar, they\u2019ve moved to use Corn Syrup and High Fructose Corn Syrup. This naturally made a lot of people very angry. So you can get the version with Sugar again. But, ignoring the green and purple versions, the spicy ones, all the variations on the theme, doubt the basic recipe of Tomato, Vinegar, Sugar, Salt has changed that much. Levels of spices and seasonings ain\u2019t gonna change except incrementally. Or to taste. Is there a Heinz Ketchup taster? Probably. The original recipe for Ketchup is buried in the swamps of time, the product of a thousand people fermenting fish, pureeing walnuts, roasting mushrooms. Heinz\u2019s original is theirs, not the worlds. Ketchup is simply a word for Sauce. See: Ketchup - Wikipedia Heinz Tomato Ketchup - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "First off ketchup is not an American creation plus it was a valued condiment clear back to the ancient rulers of Chinese dynasties [ the hokkien word - ke-tsiap -which is a type of fish sauce], who used various mixtures including fish. A farmer named Yerxa was the fist to sell tomato ketchup in a bottle. The earliest recipe I know about is from 1732- Richard Bradley\u2019s Ketchup Paste. But UK old concoctions included such things as wild mushrooms, walnuts, oysters etc. The advent of the tomatoe most likely did not make it\u2019s appearance in a big way until 1812- Mr Mease calling tomatoes \u201clove apples\u201d Of course, all recipes get changed over the years. The only time I do not deviate from a recipe is in baking,where even the smallest \u201cscrew up\u201d can cause you to have a failure. I make my own tomato paste from Roma tomatoes and other non-juicy tomato pulp and I do not always use the same spicing regimen ",
