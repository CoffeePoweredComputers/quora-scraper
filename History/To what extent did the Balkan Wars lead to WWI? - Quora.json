            "answer_text": "The murder of King Alexander I of Serbia in 1903, the Italo-Ottoman War of 1911, and the two Balkan Wars all played serious roles in causing World War I. The end of the Obrenovi\u0107 Dynasty in Serbia replaced a peaceful pro-Austrian monarchy with a pro-Russian one that sponsored pan-Slavic extremism and terrorism. The Italian defeat of the Ottomans in 1911 inspired the Balkan nations, having been under the yoke of Turkey over four centuries, to attack their former master in the First Balkan War. The Second Balkan War was a follow up on the first where everyone in the Balkans (including the Ottomans this time) ganged up on Bulgaria, who it was felt got too much of the spoils of the First War. All of this fueled nationalist and expansionist tensions in the region that were threatening to spill out into terror and conflict. Bismarck said that if there was a European wide war again, it \u201cwould come out of some damned foolish thing in the Balkans\". The tensions that these Balkan crises from 1903\u20131913 finally did metastasize in the Black Hand murder of Franz Ferdinand on 28 June 1914. ",
