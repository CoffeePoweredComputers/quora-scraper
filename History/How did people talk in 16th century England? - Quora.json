            "answer_text": "There are several good answers here saying, just look at Shakespeare, Sir Philip Sidney and the rest, which are perfectly right, but\u2026 They were writing poetry, or poetic drama, and this should not be mistaken for the ordinary, everyday speech of Elizabethan England. Don't look at the grand speeches in iambic pentametres, full of imagery and literary devices for your picture of this, but at the prose dialogue of the uneducated, working class characters \u2014 Henry V's soldiers, the Rude Mechanicals producing an amateur performance of Pyramus and Thisbe, people like that. And look at the Authorised Version of the Bible, the King James edition. This is a little bit later, but not much, and is probably a much better guide to everyday Elizabethan English than Hamlet \u2014 unless, of course, you are looking at the gravediggers. ",

            "answer_text": "As I wrote just now in answer to What were mannerisms used when talking in 16th century England? You have to wonder why the OP wanted to remain anonymous. Maybe he never heard of Shakespeare? Or just couldn\u2019t be bothered to try reading any of his plays. Or those of Christopher Marlowe and other Elizabethan playwrights. Or of course, he might try finding something posted on YouTube during 1500\u20131599.So it\u2019s pleasing that Adora didn\u2019t write this question anonymously. ",

            "answer_text": "It was something of a mess in that the 16th century was the culminating period of the Great Vowel Shift - Wikipedia. By Shakespeare\u2019s time, and in London itself, this had largely been completed and so pronunciations, though still sounding different, were not crazy different from modern English. Depending on where and how early in the 16th century, an English speaker might be talking with a very exaggerated pirate accent. ",
