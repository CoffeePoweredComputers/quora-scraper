            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. International Relations is quite a wide field, incorporating some elements and theoretic principles from politics, economics and some other social sciences. There isn't one basic theory, but I'll try to put very briefly some of the essentials - I will just mention them here to steer your personal research. I'd like to say much of what I mention is my own view of what are essential theories and authors, so take it with a grain of salt. First would be to understand what are the Great Debates; it's exactly as it sounds, three moments in which IR theory was split between different views. It's important to know what were those theories, what did they say and how exactly they differ from each other so much that it sparked years-long debates.  The first Great Debate is Realism - Idealism. The beginning of the discipline is here, and these two viewpoints were at odds with each other in the 1930's to the 1950's. Since this is the beginning, you'd do good to familiarize yourself with some intellectual precedents of each theory: for Realism, they would be the works of Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes; for Idealism, Immanuel Kant. The key people of this debate are Hans Morgenthau and E.H. Carr, Norman Angell and Woodrow Wilson. Another interesting feature of the time is a theory that isn't completely in any side of the debate, the English School (Hedley Bull). The second Great Debate is that of Traditionalism - Scientism. This is where things get more complicated, as these two aren't IR theories per se, but ways in which IR scholars thought out theory-making; should they ground themselves in history and politics alone or adopt the scientific method as much as it could be adopted? The actual theories that arise from the growing scientism of this age are Structural Realism (Kenneth Waltz) and Neoliberalism (Robert Keohane). The third Great Debate is a matter of contention. The more widely accepted interpretation is that it reflects how the discipline was filled with different paradigms starting from the 1980's. So what are the actual theories that compose most of it? Beyond structural realism and neoliberalism, we see the advent of Constructivism (Alexander Wendt), World Systems Theory (Immanuel Wallerstein) and Marxism (Robert W. Cox). The fourth and arguably current Great Debate is one of Positivism - Post-positivism. Like the second one, this is about how scholars think the theorizing of IR. Do we use positivist assumptions (such as \"science is objective\") or do we go post-positivist and consider science is a discourse, truth is relative, etc? The theories built so far are positivist, and the one that gets most attention in the post-positivism camp is Critical Theory (Andrew Linklater). There are some concepts that are reoccurring in IR. You will find these in many different theories, sometimes one agreeing with each other, but most likely having different ideas of what that is and how does it help understand our world. Some of these concepts are anarchy, state, balance of power, agency, structure, international system or international society, non-state actors, international regimes, and the security dilemma. I take the liberty of posting these three well-done short videos which go over the basics of the most \"popular\" IR theories nowadays: realism, liberalism and constructivism. I would like to finish with a metaphor one of my teachers used when he was teaching us IR theory in university. A theory is like a pair of glasses that you wear in order to understand the world. Actions and facts are not the consequences of theory. They are what they are, and you can interpret them in many ways - see the world through all these different glasses of many colors. That was longer than I expected, but if you research on this it would give you a quite wide view of how the IR field is today.  ",

            "answer_text": "The world, like we have to see it, is a man made one, made by a cultural industry - the cage we all live in. The world is ruled by some 20000 criminal clans - you can find that out without too many difficulties if you did a research. Just try to find out something about the global financial system. The cultural industry is a kind of Cesar\u2019s dream, an artificial reality to keep and renew the power of the super rich and to stop climbers. Look at the history of the 30years War. Example: Ms Mohn, head of the Bertelsmann owners family is one of the most powerful figures controlling media, book and music market, but the point is that she offers a nice mix of left wing and right wing journals and book editions. Both. Wherever you went with your curiosity or anger you would always meet her and her family again\u2026 International relations are nothing else than dividing claims of the gangs. Check the list of dead or disappeared journalists and the stories behind them (Malta, but just the US would be enough). Who was Kashoggi and his relatives? You might find out that the same families have been ruling England for more than 500 years (only few documents from the remoter past). No, we can\u2019t do anything against this - but good to know and meet other nice \u201aknowers\u2018. ",
