But between endless propaganda and indoctrination, actually making the lives of most Soviet citizens much better, and leading the country to victory in WWII, he was adultated. Intellectuals like me, Party members and Army Officers in the 1930s, and Jews felt otherwise. But these were a tiny minority. ",
