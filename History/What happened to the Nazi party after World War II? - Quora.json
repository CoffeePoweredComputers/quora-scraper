            "answer_text": "What Ed Goodger said.Plus, formation of \u201cNational Socialist\u201d parties and any others closely resembling them in ideology was banned in Germany (and likely some other European countries, as well), as was the use of their symbols etc., and societies of any kind trying to continue the Nazi \u201cheritage\u201d. There were some more or less open attempts at forming such societies/parties in post-war Germany, but they were quashed pretty quickly. Some clandestine organizations of the type managed to evade detection and dissolution for a while, but when they were found out, they were disbanded and their members tried and usually convicted. Its members\u2019 lot varied greatly. Most simple members who weren\u2019t involved in crimes against humanity etc. (the so-called \u201cMitl\u00e4ufer\u201d) were able to continue with their lives after a (more or less thorough) vetting of their actions during the Nazi years. Those involved in crimes and most higher-level functionaries were tried and usually sentenced to anything from relatively short jail sentences to death, depending on their level of involvement and the quality of their defense.

            "answer_text": "I quote; The party was formally abolished on 10 October 1945 by the Allied Control Council and denazification began, along with trials of major war criminals before the International Military Tribunal (IMT) in Nuremberg. Part of the Potsdam Agreement called for the destruction of the Nationalist Socialist Party alongside the requirement for the reconstruction of the German political life. In addition, the Control Council Law no. 2 Providing for the Termination and Liquidation of the Nazi Organization specified the abolition of 52 other Nazi affiliated and supervised organisations and prohibited their activities. The denazification was carried out in Germany and continued until the onset of the Cold War. ",
