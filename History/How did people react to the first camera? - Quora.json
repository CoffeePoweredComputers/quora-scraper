            "answer_text": "What do you mean by the \u201cfirst\u201d camera? The camera obscura - essentially a room with a small hole in one side with the image projected on the opposite wall was a very popular exhibit wherever one was set up at a fair or exposition. Later Talbot, Deguerre, and others built \u201csmall\u201d versions of the camera obscura where the image was projected on a light sensitive material. (Small is a relative term - think in terms of a box 18x24x30 inches). Scientific societies where these images were shown were astounded and more folks started experimenting with different light sensitive materials and the foundation they were coated on. Glass, paper, metal, cloth. Cameras were still large boxes and the sensitive material was \u201cplates\u201d usually of glass with the light sensitive media coated on the glass. The very earliest plates had to be exposed and developed while still wet from coating. Due to the size of cameras and the associated \u201cmess\u201d that went with making pictures they were mostly owned only by professionals, however the public at large went bonkers at having portraits made. Eventually the light sensitive media could be dry for exposure and could remain dry for sometime before processing. Cameras were still large and still mostly in the hands of professional of one genre or the other - Studio photographers, Newspaper photographers, Landscape photographers. Later still (1889) George Eastman invented a flexible base \u201ccelluloid\u201d to carry the light sensitive emulsion, made 100 exposure 120 size film rolls, loaded them in a small, easy to use box camera (The Kodak) and sold them to the public. They were extremely popular and practically every family had one. Thus, while the The Kodak wasn\u2019t the \u201cfirst\u201d camera it can be credited with bringing photography available to almost everyone. ",

            "answer_text": "IN the 1820 and 1830s scientists were working on the first cameras. They were scientific experiments unknown to the general public. Buy the 1860\u2019s more people became aware of the possibility and wealthy families began making \u2018portraits\u2019. It was in the 1860s the Mathew Brady\u2019s team of photographers documenting the horrors of the Civil War that news photography and the idea of social impact from photography grew up , as least here in America. Even then, cameras and photography was both considered a phenomenon and debated as cheap replacement for a trained painter. ",

            "answer_text": "The first camera was incapable of producing a preserveable latent image, so not many people at all possible were aware of it's existence or ability to project a non latent image until Romantic era painters began using camera obscuras to paint plein air landscapes inside of these boxes with a simple hole in one end where light would project through and create a reversed image on the rear plane of the box. The artist using a camera obscura would then simply paint the projected image on a prepared canvas and voila! Later, however came Charles Daguerre and his Daguerreotype cameras, which were very heavy but more portable, but were actually able to make a decent latent image but only with an extremely long exposure time. This made it impossible to capture moving subjects. Daguerre's photographs exist to this day presently, but in thier own era, they were criticized as 'Cities of the Dead' due to the fact that they appeared as cityscapes, which were almost exclusively devoid of human activity.

            "answer_text": "How did people react to the first camera? It depends on what you mean by \u201ccamera.\u201d If you mean the first image captured on a sensitized medium using a box with a lens to focus light - along the lines of the work of Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce - the first reactions were limited to science enthusiasts, not the general public. Any excitement would not have been over quality - they weren\u2019t very good images - but over future potential. It wasn\u2019t until Louis Daguerre developed the daguerreotype that photography became generally accessible and commercially viable. But the camera had been around long, long before any of that. Even the people who are aware of the camera obscura:  \u2026tend to underestimate the age of the camera, by centuries at least, even in terms of human awareness of the camera. See, the camera obscura pictured above is actually a highly refined form of this:  This type of camera obscura was old when Leonardo Da Vinci played with it. This type of camera actually forms spontaneously without the least need of a human mind. Any darkened chamber that just happens to have a smallish opening opposite a flattish wall forms an image of whatever that opening happens to be pointing towards. Intent is not needed. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that the very first human to recognize that the scene outside their cave was upside down inside the cave but in an intangible form projected on the wall really had no idea of what was happening. My guess is that they were amazed, especially if someone they knew happened along to be projected, not unlike the figure above. But that probably happened long before writing was developed, maybe even before language, so we have no record of the reaction. ",
