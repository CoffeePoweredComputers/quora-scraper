            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a conspiracy theory inventor who calls himself Peter Koenig. He recently wrote an article quoting Bill Gates as having said in a TED talk: \u201cIf we are doing a real good job vaccinating children, we can reduce the world population by 10% to 15%.\u201d It\u2019s grotesquely disingenuous. The actual quote from the Ted talk was, \u201cIf we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10% or 15%\u201d He's talking about a comprehensive healthcare strategy that is a component in \"getting rid of poverty\" (@ 05:15) which is the immediate topic and context. The correlation between poverty and high birth rates is well known. So ... why misquote and strip away context? Now learn the broader context from Forbes Magazine from a decade ago \u2026 \"So in 1997, when he and Melinda first ventured into public health\u2014their eponymous foundation would come into being in two years\u2014they focused on birth control, funding a Johns Hopkins effort to use computers to help women in the developing world learn about contraception. The logic was crisp and Bill Gates-friendly. Health = resources \u00f7 people. And since resources, as Gates noted, are relatively fixed, the answer lay in population control. Thus, vaccines made no sense to him: Why save kids only to consign them to life in overcrowded countries where they risked starving to death or being killed in civil war? \"It wasn\u2019t dissimilar from the formula that he was developing behind a multibillion-dollar push into education reform. In that case, he based his giving on this formula: Success = teachers \u00f7 students. Smaller class sizes would result in more attention per student and smarter kids. \"But much as Gates loves elegant solutions, his greatest achievements have resulted from perseverance and adaptability. It took three versions to get Windows right, and the Xbox originally lost billions. He\u2019s not afraid to challenge assumptions when they don\u2019t work. And in education he\u2019s had a clear reversal: Class size, it turns out, is not the best determinant of student outcome. Teacher quality is. So after spending a fortune, Gates shifted course. \"That same epiphany for his public health philanthropy came even earlier. Bill\u2019s dad had set up a dinner at Seattle\u2019s posh Columbia Tower Club with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). While the meeting started with birth control\u2014among other efforts, PATH taught Chinese condom makers to test their products before shipping them\u2014Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls\u2014specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people\u2014the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. \u201cIt goes against common sense,\u201d Gates says. Most parents don\u2019t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die. 'If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,'\u2008says Melinda. \"In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn. Rather than prevent births, he would aim his billions at saving the kids already born. \u201cWe moved pretty heavily into vaccines once we understood that,\u201d says Gates.\" -- Forbes Magazine: With Vaccines, Bill Gates Changes The World Again (added emphasis mine) Koenig also claimed: Gates was \"\u2026 sterilizing young women (Kenya, with modified tetanus vaccines).\" A quick fact-check in Snopes reveals: Is Tetanus Vaccine Spiked with Sterilization Chemicals? Wanna know what\u2019s going on\u2026 follow the money!! Easy peasy. Simple pimple \u2026 articles about famous people doing bad stuff get clicks, clicks get advertising dollars.

            "answer_text": "Bill Gates is - for the most part - a genuinely good guy. He made a fuckton of money, and he has been pouring it into good causes for the latter part of his life. And in recent times (the past few years or so) he has been warning that America was not prepared for a pandemic of this scale. That it scrapped the response teams, it cut the budget and so forth. All of this was done under the orders of the President inaugurated in 2017, and now that Mister Gates was proven right, the fans and hangers on and sycophants (and there is a reason that word starts with the word \u201csicko) are not saying \u201cOh - you were right. Perhaps our trust in our God Emperor was misplaced\u201d No - they are starting a concerted effort to blame the man who was pointing out the failures of said God Emperor. Because when you can\u2019t attack the facts (since the facts aren\u2019t in doubt) you attack the man. It is the way The President does things - he has rewritten his own past, and America\u2019s, so many times that if you believe him he single handedly won World War II, tried to fight off the planes at The Twin Towers and defeated ISIS with just a single look.. So it is hardly surprising that his mindless supporters are now doing the same - rewriting history by attacking an innocent man - a good man at that - and blaming him for something he had nothing to do with. He (The President) will be the death of America. if he is re-elected. The country cannot possibly stand another four years of this - it just can\u2019t. ",
