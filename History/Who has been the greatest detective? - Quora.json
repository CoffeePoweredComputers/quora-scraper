            "answer_text": "I am going to go with a very unconventional choice. He is not even a detective per se. But He satisfies all the requirements listed in the question. My pick is Patrick Jane (The Mentalist). A CBI consultant. Witty, Funny has some amazing powers of observation and deduction (you'll have to watch The Mentalist for that). Has a certain air of mystique. Terrific sense of humor. Some of the most effective and the most entertaining methods to catch criminals. A sizzling on-screen chemistry with Teresa Lisbon. Carries himself so confidently and with lot of suave. This show might seem like an ordinary procedural at first, but I assure you it is much more than that. Do watch and give it a try. You won't be disappointed. :) Have been an ardent fan and admirer of the show and Patrick Jane :)Its as if Simon Baker was born to play Jane :)      ",
