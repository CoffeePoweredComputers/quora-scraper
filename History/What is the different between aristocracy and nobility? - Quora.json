            "answer_text": "An aristocrat usually has a hereditary title that is attached to their land. In feudal times, they were largely the local government representing the sovereign. They had the power to collect rents for themselves and taxes for the sovereign, although they usually had to pay taxes to the sovereign themselves. In modern use, kings, dukes, viscounts and princes are all \u201caristocracy\u201d and in England they\u2019re usually related to the Queen by blood. A noble is merely someone who has been given a title or office in the government. Their title or office expires upon their death and they are usually still considered as \u201ccommoners\u201d. In modern usage, knights and lords are nobles, although there is some overlap with lords, some of whom may be hereditary. It is unlikely any of them are direct blood relations of the sovereign. ",

            "answer_text": "Q. What is the difference between aristocracy and nobility? (1) Thanks for the A2A. (2) Nobility is a social class. It\u2019s normally ranked immediately under royalty, that possesses more acknowledged privileges and higher social status than most other classes in a society. Membership is typically hereditary. Noblemen or noblewomen may or may not have political power. There is no assumption that nobles have power. Privilege and high social class do not necessarily infer power. (3) \u201cxxxxcracy\u201d means rule by. Democracy is rule by people (Greek demos). Technocracy is rule by technocrats. Autocracy is rule by an autocrat. Kleptocracy, rule by kleptomaniacs, that is thieves! Thus, Aristocracy is rule by aristocrats. In modern times, where noblemen and noblewomen are not so common in our midst, in colloquial situations, the term \u2018aristocracy\u2019 may be used in the loose metaphorical sense, to mean, often in the negative sense, the \u2018privileged well-connected chosen ones\u2019 who are in power to rule us.
