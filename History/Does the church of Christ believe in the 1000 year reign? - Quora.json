            "answer_text": "The majority of the churches of Christ hold to the amillennial position, which is the view that there will not be a future 1000 year reign. The Restoration Movement is the historical background for the churches of Christ with leaders Alexander Campbell and Barton Stone in the early 1800s. In the 1800s Restoration Movement Christians held to a variety of end-time views and the subject was not regarded as a test of fellowship. Probably the most popular view was the postmillennial position - that Christ will return after a reign of peace on earth. In 1906 the non-instrumental churches of Christ were officially listed as a separate organization from the Disciples of Christ/Christian Churches. Before and after this time, a popular preacher - R.H. Boll - wrote frequent articles advocating his premillennial views. After 1918 the horrors of World War I blunted the optimistic postmillennial view and afterward, it declined. Within the churches of Christ most held to the amillennial view while a significant minority were premillennial. In the 1930s some well-known church of Christ leaders - Foy Wallace in particular - decided to contentiously campaign against R.H. Boll and the premillennial view. Over the years it led to a condemning of premillennialism as a heresy. This resulted in placing the premillennial churches of Christ \u201coutside\u201d the fellowship of the majority amillennial churches of Christ. These days the issue has faded so much that the premillennial churches of Christ are no longer considered a separate fellowship. ",

            "answer_text": "Some church members do. But most do not, but rather see that as figurative, as is much of Revelation. The kingdom began on Pentecost in A.D. 33. Cf. Matt. 16:18\u201319; Mark 9:1 with Acts 2. Paul said the Christians in Colosse were in \u201cthe kingdom\u201d (Col. 1:13). John said that he was \u201cin the tribulation and the Kingdom\u2026\u201d (Rev. 1:9). The tribulation occurred in the life of John and some years after, and the kingdom is now. ",
