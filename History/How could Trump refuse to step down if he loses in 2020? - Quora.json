            "answer_text": "My answer is in partially in response to Roland Temmerman (nice profile picture) which I\u2019m taking from my comment with a little preamble. If convicted, ex-President Trump would have no choice. He, his family, and his possessions would be physically removed from the White House if he refused. Regardless of the scare-mongers, the rule of law still applies. Also, how can someone be called a Fascist if their actions are to reduce government power. The Fascist ideology is all power to the state (very similar, not the same, to communism except the opposite stance on religion). Anyway, here\u2019s my comments from the other answer which really doesn\u2019t answer this question specifically but is on the impeachment in general - enjoy! \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- This is a very simple matter that is easy to explain by using the 2 previous Presidential impeachments (and an extra) before delving into this one. 1 Andrew Johnson - Congress impeached the President for intentionally violating the Tenure of Office Act, a fact not in dispute, President Johnson did commit this crime. The Senate ruled that the crime was not worthy of impeachment and acquitted. Which is the Senates constitutional prerogative. 2. William Clinton - Congress impeached the President on grounds of perjury to a grand jury, a fact not in dispute, President Clinton did commit this crime. The Republican Controlled Senate ruled that the crime was not worthy of impeachment and acquitted (55\u201345, Senate membership was (R)55, (D)45 so some republicans voted for acquittal). Are we beginning to see a picture here. 3. Richard Nixon - While the Watergate trial was underway the Republican Senate leadership met with the President and informed him that if it came to an impeachment trial (far future at that time) the President would be found guilty. Nixon later used that information as part of his reasoning for resigning. Not an impeachment, but a case of pretrial \u201cbiased\u201d decision making by Senators. Does anyone consider this pretrial bias to be wrong? Just a question to think about. 4. The Orange Buffoon - Charged with \u201cAbuse of Power\u201d and \u201cObstruction of Congress\u201d. A. Abuse of power - I won\u2019t touch as that is to emotionally charged for this President, but I think that all Presidents can be accused of that by their political opposition if they try hard enough. B. Obstruction of Congress - I have to question how one branch of the federal government can obstruct another, other than thru the constitutionally mandated checks and balances. The 3 Branches are supposed to obstruct each other according to the constitution. So I see the Senate, once again, saying that these charges are not worthy of impeachment. Now any argument about rule of law are not relevant as the Constitution (the highest law of the land which overrules all other trivial laws) states (Section 5)\u201cEach House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings\u201d which means the Senate decides how to conduct the impeachment trial because (Section 3) \u201cThe Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present\u201d. Which means that other than having the chief justice preside (as the vice president is in a conflict of interest condition) by the Senates rules the Senate can do whatever it wants so long as it ends in a vote. So don\u2019t be surprised that some people have made up their minds, as this is not being presented to them suddenly. ",

            "answer_text": "How could Trump refuse to step down if he loses in 2020? Welcome back to Aluminium Foil Hat, the show hosted by a dirty foreigner who thinks the United States used to be great but is crumbling. Let\u2019s all say the tagline together: What\u2019s your conspiracy?! Today we\u2019ll be discussing the fear that the President of the United States will refuse to step down. Now, as everyone knows and likes to say, US law is clear that a president ceases to be president at a certain time and a certain day if he loses the election. However, the fact that this question has to be asked at all shows that something is already very wrong - that some Americans are concerned that the current president will not obey the law. And why wouldn\u2019t he? We\u2019ve already seen how little he cares for the law. How he frames every criticism of himself as an attack on democracy. The current president cares so little for convention that Americans have started to lose faith in their institutions that have stood for so long. But this question is how could Trump refuse to step down. Well, remember how he questioned the allegiances of Democrats? How he said Democrats may not be Americans? It\u2019s plausible he may have the Supreme Court declare all votes for candidates other than himself invalid. After all, those who don\u2019t vote for Trump are un-American traitors who support crime and the destruction of the country. If they wanted what was best for the country, they would vote for Trump, the best president America has ever had! So it doesn\u2019t matter if 99% of the districts voted against Trump, if 537 of the 538 electors voted Democrat. The Supreme Court is staffed by pro-Trump judges. They can simply say those votes are against the interests of the United States and cannot be counted.
