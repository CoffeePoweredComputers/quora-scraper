            "answer_text": "Akkad, or the Akkadian Empire, was the first Semitic speaking Empire of Mesopotamia. It reached its peak sometime between the 24th and 22nd centuries B.C. following its conquest by Sargon of Akkad. It is sometimes referred to as the first Empire in history, thought that is still a subject of debate. After the fall of the Akkadian Empire around 2150 B.C. , the people of the Empire re-formed as two separate Akkadian speaking groups with Assyria to the north and Babylon to the south. ",
