I hung out with a gang that worked for this guy and usually it was break ins, extortion, carjackings/chop shops, truck hijackings, collecting loans, and some drug sales (this wasn't even with the Mob guys, this was in the \u2018'farm team\u2019) and I got a pretty small cut (like 20%) of whatever I made. That life is behind me now. ",
