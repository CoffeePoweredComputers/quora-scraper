            "answer_text": "From a Federal standpoint it would be a combination of a barrel no less than 16 inches And an overall length (in firing condition) of 26 inches. Less than that is legal but only with a Federal Tax stamp which costs $200 and the permission of the government. That\u2019s not really the roadblock that it sounds, qualifying for the tax stamp isn\u2019t especially rigorous, it\u2019s mostly a waiting game for the paperwork to go through. ",

This is for a regular, unregulated(most states) rifle. In many states you can legally obtain/create a short barreled rifle by going through the proper steps and paying the federal government $200, the same process you'd use for a legal machine gun. ",
