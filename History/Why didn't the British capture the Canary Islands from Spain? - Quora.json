            "answer_text": "Overall Spain has always made a priority to keep the islands when thinking of the risk of a war, especially in modern history. Franco himself was well aware of the risk of an invasion on the islands from the Allies if he helped Hitler throughout WWII. The islands are relatively far from Spain but they are a lot further from Britain, so what matters here are the naval forces and the locals. All the land forces not stationed in the isles are useless. Spain counted on the loyalty of the locals and basically that is what saved the islands from every British attack. The only proper British attack on the Canary Islands was actually carried out by Nelson and it was a failure. He attacked the island of Tenerife, the city of Santa Cruz which is the capital of the island. Bellow is the city of Santa Cruz in the year 1797   Nelson outnumbered Spanish forces 1 to 40, but the local volunteers and militias evened that to a British advantage of 1 to 8. Nelson's plan was a \u201csecret\u201d attack in which a large British force would just run over unprepared few Spanish soldiers. But the fact that Spanish ships warned the authorities of Tenerife of a British force sailing there a few days in advance resulted in the creation of militias and strengthening of the defenses. So Nelson's 1st attack was a failure.  In the 2nd attack Nelson tried to get as close as possible to the beach and then sail the shortest distance to shore, being that the most vulnerable point in the attack. The British reached the beach and landed but the Spanish forces nearby were ready and opened cannon fire from several different points, and the large British force overwhelmed had to pull back to the ships.  In a 3rd attempt Nelson decided to attack the city itself, dividing the forces in 2 groups: one to take control of the city and keep the civilians under control in order to stop a potential uprising, the other to attack the castle where the Spanish forces were located. The local authorities of the island expected him to attack the city and fortified the disembarkment locations. Nelson's forces tried to reach the city in the night getting to the shore with boats hidden under clothes the same shade of the sea. But unfortunately for him a Spanish ship spotted them and warned the city, the cannons opened fire on the boats and only 5 boats reached the city, the men from those 5 boats had to face the militias waiting for them and Nelson himself was wounded in the arm (being this battle the worst for him personally of his career). After that he abandonned the attack on the islands altogether. The cannon named el Tigre or \u2018the Tiger\u2019 was the one that reached Nelson, and the city keeps it as a symbol of the victory  Today it is known as La Gesta del \u201997 and it is a holiday of the city of Santa Cruz, with a recreation of the battle around the 22-25th of July.

            "answer_text": "The British Royal Navy raided the Canary Islands intermittently in the course of 18th century wars and during the Napoleonic Wars and in fact Lord Horatio Nelson, of Trafalgar fame, lost an arm and an eye during a raid on the Canary Islands port of Tenerife, but the Islands were never intended to be permanently seized by the British because they were not really that strategically important; they\u2019re out in the Atlantic, closer to Africa than Europe and off the major commercial shipping routes, then as now. Furthermore, the British had some excellent ports and bases in that general area that were much better located and that they could use basically free of charge, like Madeira, the Azores and the Cape Verde Islands, which belonged to Great Britain\u2019s longtime ally, Portugal. Given all of that, capturing and holding the Canary Islands wasn\u2019t such a good proposition from a cost-benefit aspect. The Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean were much better strategically located as far as British interests were concerned, situated as they were between Gibraltar and Malta and on the major shipping routes to Cyprus and Egypt, which is the reason that the British did capture and hold the island of Menorca in the Balearics for a number of years in the 18th century and had important naval and military installations there, until they lost the island in a French invasion and Menorca was subsequently returned to Spain.
