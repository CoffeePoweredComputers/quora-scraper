            "answer_text": "Image of a Sarazene ship  Yes. Several times. The first recorded bigger military clash happened around the year 1000, when a Muslim (Sarazen) fleet started from Sizilia with over 120 ships to conquer Rome. On the way, the admiral was informed, that 16 \u201cpaddle boats\u201d were crossing their way. The admiral ordered to sink them and have some more slaves to row their warships, who were each over 100 meters long compared to 16 meters of the \u201cpaddle boats\u201d. But later that day, the 16 paddle boats were still afloat, but over 100 of the longboats had been cut like hot butter into pieces by ramming them with the small but solid unsinkable Viking long distance ships. The Vikings did not bother and continued on their course towards the Black Sea. Consequences: Rome was saved from the Sarazens, declared a miracle by the pope. And the Sarazens were weakened to an extend, that an admiral from Byzanz was able to conquere Sizilia from the Muslims. Also later the Langobards and also Byzanz hired Viking mercenaries, also to fight against the Sarazens. And some of those Vikings founded the Normanic Empire of Sizilia some years later. And later several Vikings, also two kings took part in crusades. ",

            "answer_text": "A simple web search could have provided better answers than most of those here, I am sorry to say. While Danish and Norwegian \u201cvikings\u201d (\u201cviking\u201d is a verb, and it means \u201cto got out to sea in order to raid\u201d) went to Britain and Iceland, the Swedes went east to the modern Baltics, Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. The Russian civilization, including the origin of the name Russia, the \u201cKievan Rus,\u201d is built on the foundations of the viking trading settlements along the major north-south river systems of the area between modern Saint Petersburg and the Black Sea. The vikings established a system of trading posts and commercial shipping that lasted for centuries, and eventually morphed into modern Eastern Europe. Their main exports were initially furs, which were in high demand in the Middle East as a fashion item. Animals in cold northern environments typically grow thicker, softer, more luxurious fur than those in the deserts of Southwest Asia, and beaver and mink were big sellers. The vikings also (like the Arabs, the Christians, and everybody else throughout history) conducted a thriving slave trade, selling lots of Slavs and Europeans to the Muslims and vice versa. DNA analysis indicates that some of those buried with a Swedish viking king came from Persia (it was common to send slaves along to serve the ruler in the afterlife). So, the Muslims met lots of vikings from Russia and did daily business with them . The Byzantine empire\u2019s Varangian Guards were recruited from the northern areas of what is now Denmark, Germany, and Scandinavia. Using foreign mercenary troops as royal household security is a long-standing tradition, and the Swiss Guards still protect the Vatican (which is in Italy, not Switzerland, in case anyone is unsure). When the Normans (who had been vikings a few generations earlier) overran England, many Englishmen (Anglo-Saxons) fled to the Frisian coast of northern Germany, since the English and Frisian languages were mutually intelligible. Many of these displaced Englishmen, with no money or prospects, went into the Varangian Guard. They had the misfortune of meeting Normans again in Sicily; Norman mercenaries brought in to help local rulers had taken over that kingdom and eventually drove out both the Muslims and the Byzantines. So, since the Normans were basically vikings on horseback and the Varangians were viking infantry, the Muslims met lots of them coming from both directions. Many Danes and Norwegians also accompanied the later Crusades. In one account I read a Norseman ironically refers to Muslim corsair pirates as \u201cvikings.\u201d It\u2019s important to remember that gold and silver were not always in great supply, and as the world\u2019s population increased the value of scarce precious metals also increased. Burial sites from all the areas where the vikings went (Scotland, Ireland, Iceland) are replete with Caliphate coins, as well as other luxury goods such as jewelry and fine fabrics. One thing the vikings did not take from the Muslims was their religion. They had more than enough gods of their own, and the presence of Islamic calligraphy on rings in York or fabrics in Denmark in no way meant that Islam made inroads into Scandinavia, any more than a young American moron having a tattoo of a Chinese character means he is a becoming communist or Confuscian. A recent story from the British newspaper The Guardian and mindlessly echoed by the BBC and New York Times (Why did Vikings have 'Allah' on clothes?) postulated \u201cPresumably, Viking age burial customs were influenced by Islam and the idea of an eternal life in paradise after death.\u201d No. The embroidery in fact did not say \u201cAllah,\u201d as anyone who can actually read Arabic can tell you (Did Viking Couture Really Feature the Word \u2018Allah\u2019?). The presence of a Ming vase in a rich European\u2019s house or a \u201cMade in China\u201d shirt in a poor person\u2019s trailer in no way indicates the owner has rejected his own culture in favor of that of an Asian civilization. It\u2019s just business. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Lots of muslim coins have been found at Viking trading ports and the Vikings traversed the rivers east and south of their Scandinavian homelands, (being called Rus by the slavs, to give birth to Rus-land). They sailed down to the Black Sea and traded, and mayhap fought. The Norwegian king Sigurd Jorsalfar, as well, went on a crusade, being a christian and this being a bit after the real age of Vikings. Aa well, they would have met muslims in Spain, and likely as far as Morocco in the western expansion. If we count the Normans as Vikings they of course meet again in Sicily and the Crusades there as well, but these far flung cousins might well be outside of the scope of this question. ",

Vikings traveled through Russia South and East to Constantinople (among other places) where they traded amber, furs etc for silk among other things.  There are some Viking runes at Hagia Sophia which became a Muslim place of worship.  Vikings also brought slaves from around the world with them. Some of those may have been Muslim from various countries.  Many artifacts (coins in particular) were minted in places like Baghdad almost certainly by Muslim coiners. ",
