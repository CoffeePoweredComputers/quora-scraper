            "answer_text": "Rather than answer directly, I thought it\u2019d be fun to debunk one of the more complete answers on here. And I like lists, and so did he so. His original answer in italics. Some of the things that would have happened if there were no internet: No Wikipedia meant students doing their homework and completing their projects themselves, which involvpes hard work and dedication, resulting in intelligent and logically adept children around the world. Of course, some wouldn\u2019t still do their homework :PThe internet isn\u2019t the only way to cheat, and without instant access to things, teachers would rely more heavily on printed tests instead of just looking things up and submitting them (without double sourcing) There would be Amazon or Flipkart or other e-commerce companies, people would still have to buy everything from shops, so there wouldn\u2019t be much competition in the price department.There has been and always will be tremendous competition between brick and mortar stores. Feel free to watch Miracle on 34th Street as an example of how that sort of fierce competition was going on way back then. In addition, buying on the internet is just mail order. That's it. Amazon, for all their wonders, are a mail order catalog company (in addition to being a media company). People would still order lots of things from the catalog they would receive in the mail. Or even order at the store for pickup (sounds familiar?) No online banking systems available, which meant people had to stand in long queues for withdrawal, deposit, cheque clearance etc.Have you been to a bank lately? There are still long lines. And ATM existed before the Internet properly did. Other various online government facilities would not have been available, resulting in queues everywhere as population would grow exponentially.The population does not grow exponentially. And, DMV anyone? Huge amount of paperwork everywhere, inspite of the fact considering that computers were present when there was no internet, so things could be stored in hard disks but still the disks at those times were still very small in memory and huge in size or considering now, high capacity disks are available, still huge paperwork in absence of Internet.You\u2019re describing NOW. The \u2018paperless office\u2019 never happened. All my clients still have multiple fax machines, huge piles of papers, and they print everything including emails. The size of storage disks, and the processing ability of computers is not (one could argue) connected to an \u201cinternet.\u201d There would have been no E-Mails, so handwritten or printer letters have to be sent out to people we wanted to deliver.Exactly like what happens now. The united states post office currently delivers 506 MILLION pieces of mail, each day. And, businesses constantly mail things, physically. Advertisers still use blind physical mailings, with an expected return of 1.5%. Newspapers, Magazinesand Comics had to be read only on paper and not online, so again huge stash of paperwork here too.Exactly like now. There are still magazines, newspapers, etc. We still get mailers almost daily from stores. And, around Christmas? Yikes. Big catalogs come out from stores I\u2019ve never even heard of. Plus, it would be kind of cool to have a Kindle and have to go to the local library to get new ebooks. Had there been no Internet, there would have been more severe deforestation than happening now, because then for everything paperwork would have increased causing to huge environmental degradation and who knows going at this rate, hardly any trees would be left for paperwork causing the world to get extinct within the next few decades. I am answering this question mainly with reference to the effect on Environment had there been no Internet. INTERNET IS A BOON FOR HUMANKIND!!!I\u2019m doubtful this would have happened. I have no data either way, but don\u2019t feel that The Internet Saved The trees. I will add this: Without the Internet, teens would have a LOT more empathy, and it wouldn\u2019t have been destroyed by instant gratification apps like facebook, twitter, snapchat, instagram. There would be a lot less virtue signalling, and false outrage. Instead of instantly tweeting some nonsense, you\u2019d have to type up a letter to the editor. Diaclaimer: I meant no harm to the original poster (and left out his name). His points are good ones, I am just disputing them because I\u2019m lazy and it\u2019s easier to dispute what\u2019s already written. And more fun! ",

            "answer_text": "I think the answer by Tammay Mudgal tells us what would happen to the present world if internet were to go. However some of us are old enough to know a \u201cworld without internet\u201d. By that I do not mean a world without facebook , whatsapp, instagram and \u201csocial media\u201d in general. I mean literally no email, no world wide web, no autobank machines . When I bought my present car in 2015 I made an instant electronic funds transfer to the car dealership using my laptop. My contact at the car dealerhip checked his smartphone to confirm that I had paid. When I bought my first car in 1982 I used a bank guaranteed cheauque to make my paynent.Of course I could have brought a suitcase full of cash, but what if I got mugged on my way to the dealership? If you think back to an even earlier period before cashcards credit cards and autoteller machines it gets worse. Back in say 1977 if you needed any cash you went to a bank, not just any bank or indeed any branch of your bank but to a bank in which your money was kept. If you did not go to the bank in which your money was kept but to another one; that bank would have to phone your bank to physically transfer your money. That could entail making arrangements with the receiving bank and waiting maybe a few days for the transfer to be through. You needed cash for any financial transactions outside banking hours? Of course if you did not have cash you could use a cheque. However many people and companies did not accept cheques ( unless they were \u201cbank guaranteed\u201d) as anyone can sign a cheque for any amount of money. Needless to say many cheques were bad cheques that \u201cbounced\u201d! You were alive in 1977 and wanted to know certain details about a famous person like Albert Einstein? Go to your local library, look up an index for someone called \u201cAlbert Einstein\u201d , and\u2026..Good luck! Want to know about Einstein including the salient points of his theory of relativity today? Take your smartphone out of your pocket\u2026.. Need say more? The list is literally endless! ",
