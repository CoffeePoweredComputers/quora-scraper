            "answer_text": "Several supposed remains of St Peter are said to have been found in the catacombs of Rome and elsewhere, but there is little if anything to link them to the apostle Peter. An academic article, The Bones of Saint Peter? (originally published in Classics Ireland, Classics Ireland, Vol. 3 (1996)) comes from John Curran. He says (pages 33\u201336) that during the 1940s, an excavation of the catacombs directly under the high altar of St Peter\u2019s uncovered evidence of burials that seemed to date from the period 69\u201379 CE. Dr Galeazzi-Lisi was able to report the discovery of a powerfully built man aged around 65 to 70 years at the time of his death, fitting the expected description of Peter. Pope Pius XII cautiously reported that the tomb of St Peter had undoubtedly been found but that it was impossible to declare that relics found nearby were those of Peter. The remains were soon after identified by graffiti that were expertly read as stating that \u201cPeter is here within\u201d. The remains were given to Venerando Correnti, Professor of Medical Anthropology, who concluded that the remains were actually of a woman aged around 70\u201375 years and also those of two younger men. The subsequent involvement of Monsignor Ludwig Kaas and Professor Margherita Guarducci with yet another potential St Peter is discussed on pages 40\u201344. Tradition says that Peter\u2019s decapitated skull was in the Basilica of St. John Lateran, and only fragments of skull were found in this catacomb. Matching the skull with these remains could easily prove whether they were really those of Peter. However disappointment was to follow, when it was established that the skull was from a different man. Dirt found on the remains removed from the catacomb show that the body was probably in the catacomb, but never in the empty grave that had specifically been identified with Peter. Nevertheless, it was decided that these were the remains of Peter himself. What appears to have been discovered is not the remains of the venerated saint, but the enthusiasm and excessive zeal of those who would wish to prove any link between Rome and the biblical Peter. ",

            "answer_text": "The Fisherman\u2019s Tomb by James ONeill is a summary of the evidence discovered over the last 50 years since Pius XII undertook an investigation during World War II. Scientists have affirmed the discovery of the tomb, deciphered the inscriptions and recovered bones of a man in his 60\u2019s, feet cut off apparently when taken down from an upside down cross, and wrapped in a purple cloth usually reserved for the Emperor. Probability these were from Peter who died in Nero\u2019s persecution in the mid 60\u2019s C.E. A Christian writer in 150 affirmed that the graves of the founders of the Roman Church, Peter and Paul were recognizedi in his day. Constantine who built the first basilica on Vatican Hill had filled in the necropolis to level the ground for the church and thus preserved it for over a 1500 years undisturbed. The Pope has accepted the evidence of the scientists and archeologists who worked on this project. ",
