            "answer_text": "Boston, Massachussets, is known for a great number of things. The pilgrims landed on Cape Cod, in November of 1620, a mere six weeks after leaving England. Several weeks later, they decided to settle in nearby Plymouth, on Boston's south shore. I'm not greatly familiar with what Boston was known for prior to 1620, but this was a big turning point. In 1636, a small liberal arts college, named Harvard College was founded in Cambridge, which is just across the Charles river. Boston became one of the largest ports in the new colonies, and the start of the American Revolution, \"the shot heard round the world\" took flight n nearby Lexington-Concord, on April 19, 1775. So enough with the American History, already. More on Boston's colorful names: Why is Boston Called \"The Hub\"? Boston is also home to a lot of universities. Harvard, as I mentioned, and MIT are located in Cambridge, Tufts is in Somerville/Medford, and Boston University (BU) Boston College (BC), U-Mass Boston, Northeastern, Emerson, Wentworth, Berklee, Wheelock, Simmons, Suffolk, and several others are in Boston proper. Around Boston, you also have Bentley, Brandeis, UMass Lowell, and probably 40 others that I cannot think of at the moment. Boston is considered the premier Biotech hub in the country, and has a highly-skilled work force. It has four seasons. There is the Cape, Maine, Vermont, and the Berkshires, for outdoorsy stuff. You can go to Montreal, and feel like you are in a foreign country. You can catch a train or plane to New York. It has professional Baseball (Red Sox) , Football (Patriots), Hockey (Bruins), Basketball (Celtics) and Soccer (Revolution). Sometimes, you have like three different professional sports to choose from on the same night. ",
