            "answer_text": "One day, there will come a time where humans will no longer walk the planet. A morbid thought, I know, but a realistic one. We face extinction at some point and every day that we live we are just racing faster toward that inevitable end. Scientists have theorized about how it will happen and when it will happen and here is a compendium of some of the more likely theories. 1)  Global Warming - 100 YearsThis has been the hot (pun) topic for the past couple of years now. There are many skeptics, but scientists insist that the effects of global warming are real and have the evidence to support their claim. The ice caps are melting, which could wipe out a lot of arctic wildlife and raise sea levels to make some cities uninhabitable. Along with the global meltdown, the increased temperatures could make some land masses uninhabitable as well, all that needs to happen is a very minute increase in temperature and we are well on our way to accomplishing that nefarious goal. 2)  Pandemics - Any DayDiseases pop up out of nowhere and who is to say that one won't pop up tomorrow? It is hard to pinpoint and predict where disease may come from, but once we have it and are infected, it could be a problem. Especially since viruses are constantly mutating and adapting to make sure they live on and destroy us from the inside out. There has been an increase in anti-biotic resistant diseases in the world which is mighty dangerous to go along with potential man made viruses. Scientists are constantly experimenting with, creating, and destroying new diseases every day. If one were to escape the lab, who knows if we will be able to survive it. 3) Artificial Intelligence - 20 YearsHumans are making computers stronger, faster, and more powerful every day. But when will it become too powerful? Some scientists say that we are heading that way currently and since robots lack emotion and comprehension, they may see humans as imperfect creatures and try to eradicate us. We may not be powerful enough to stop them especially if they are intelligent enough to correct damages to themselves. 4) Nuclear War - 10-50 YearsIt seems like every single day there is a threat for Nuclear War from some country. That makes this extinction theory incredibly plausible and likely. Unfortunately, we have no idea when this will happen as it could happen at seemingly any moment. All it takes is one push of a button and it could wipe out WAY more people than anyone could have expected. If it doesn't, some form of retaliation will likely involve another nuclear bomb. 5) Animal Extinction - 100 YearsRecently, many leading scientists have proposed that we are currently heading towards the 6th Mass Extinction in history. Not talking about humans yet, but large animals. With more and more animals becoming endangered and many others already having died off, we are facing many repercussions if these animals were to exit. Without the population of large predators roaming the earth, disease carrying rodents that were feasted on will roam the earth passing their diseases on to humans at an exponential rate. Additionally, without the existence of large animals, there will be less food on the earth for humans to consume, thus making our food supply scarcer. No food = no humans. 6) Nanotechnology - 10-500 YearsNanotechnology could be hailed as the savior of modern medicine. Or it could cause the downfall of us all. While this seems to be the future of modern medicine, as with artificial intelligence, these robotics could see humans as innately imperfect, destroying us from the inside out. Additionally, nanotechnology is incredibly hard to regulate currently since there is limited advances in terms of these molecular and atomic sized (potential) nuisances. 7) Degenerating DNA - 6,000 YearsDNA is the blueprint for all human life. What happens when our blueprint starts to falter? We get wiped out. Unfortunately, this is happening currently. Our bodies are significantly weaker and more prone to disease than we previously were. Our reliance on medical technology has made our bodies soft and vulnerable and there is nothing we can do about it. You see, we currently are carrying thousands of genetic mutation in our DNA and each generation we create more. These mutations aren't the cool kind that make you like Wolverine or Spider-Man, quite the opposite actually. Our bodies are more prone than ever to become infected with cancer and other fatal diseases. 8) Overpopulation - 100 YearsWhat many scientists believe is our biggest problem is overpopulation. Some theorize that humanity could become extinct within 100 years because of this problem. Overpopulation could be seen as the catalyst for many of the above potential human extinction theories. Our population has doubled in the past 35 years and we keep growing which could lead to a drain of resources, food, and plant life which can lead to war.

            "answer_text": "The counter-question for you would be \u201cWhat do you mean human?\u201d While currently everyone is just about 100% meat we are increasingly replacing parts with synthetic ones and augmenting the human body with exoskeletons to perform jobs too strenuous for a person to do normally. So, in an exoskeleton you might be able to lift 2,000 kg. Is that a \u201chuman\u201d? Or how about eyeglasses? Assuming a level myopia rate among all human populations, those lucky enough to have corrective lenses often see better than average! I wear glasses so I have \u201csuper sight,\u201d at least with my glasses. The technological augmentation of the species dates to the beginning of civilization. Where does tool use give way to a veritable super power. I can fly 600 mph anywhere on the planet and get there in less than 24 hours! We take these things for granted but we actually are a very different species even than our grandparents. I am talking to people around the world right now, almost instantly. Now don\u2019t misinterpret me in saying that our ancestors are less than human. They\u2019re not, but the very word \u201chuman\u201d does get dodgy at a certain point. What if we had the ability to augment our senses or intelligence with computers? What if I could understand quantum mechanics by downloading an app, Matrix style? Kung fu! Quantum mechanics! Beastly sex! None of this is too far from reality. Sure, it\u2019s science fiction at this point but so was walking on the Moon. So was human flight, something all the experts said was impossible. If we encountered \u201chumans\u201d from 1,000 years in the future we would interpret them as gods, aliens or both. Likewise, we with our plastic clothing and precision eyewear, hearing aids, replacement limbs and joints, etc., would be as aliens to people in the 1900\u2019s! So how long will humans be on Earth? Not long. We are evolving too quickly. What if people start living in a computer simulation? The concept of what it means to be human will need a serious rewrite. It already does. ",

            "answer_text": "Almost certainly. The average \u2018lifespan\u2019 of a mammal species is around a million years (source: The Current Mass Extinction). Some persist for around 10 million years. That\u2019s a very, very long time. To put that in perspective all of recorded human history, from the ancient Pharaohs through the Roman Empire, Imperial China, the Aztec Empire, Medieval Europe, is only 5 thousand years. But as a species, we Homo sapiens have been around for about 100 thousand years. So, just going on averages, we\u2019ve got a good bit of time left as a species, but a lot of things can happen in a million years. Society could collapse. A meteor could collide with Earth. A supervolcano could erupt and wipe out crops for years. But, let\u2019s just say that we somehow manage to develop sophisticated enough technology to avoid all those potential catastrophes. Let\u2019s say we even figure out how to travel to other stars and colonize the galaxy so we\u2019re already off Earth when the Earth is no longer habitable (Scientists Estimate Earth\u2019s Remaining Habitable Lifetime, Examine Habitability of Exoplanets). Hell, let\u2019s say we even spread to other galaxies. There\u2019s still a problem. There\u2019s only so much usable energy in the universe. Once stars fuse all the light elements, there won\u2019t be anything left to make stars out of. This will happen some time around 10^14 years from now, or to write that out, 100,000,000,000,000 years from now. That\u2019s a very, very, very long time into the future, but it will eventually happen (Wikipedia - Timeline of the far future). Even if some band of humans makes an outpost with stored up fuel, they\u2019re still just postponing the inevitable. They\u2019d still eventually use up all the fuel. Even further into the future is the Heat death of the universe. This is when all usable energy of any sort is used up, somewhere on the order of 10^106 years into the future. But humans won\u2019t make it anywhere near that long. The levels of energy available would be too small to support any type of civilization. Judging by past history of other species, chances are humans will go extinct or evolve into something else within a few million years, though a catastrophe of some sort could always make it sooner. But even under the best case scenario, there\u2019s only so much usable energy in the universe, so all life in the universe is doomed to eventual extinction. ",

            "answer_text": "About the only thing that could extinguish humanity in the next 100 years or so is being hit by a huge asteroid (say 20 miles wide). That is pretty unlikely. The huge asteroid that hit the Earth about 65 million years ago and wiped out the dinosaurs would not have wiped out humanity if it hit today. What other possibilities are there? A nuclear war? Very unlikely to happen on a large scale, and even if it did, it would not wipe out all of humanity. Only Russia and the United States have enough nuclear weapons to wipe out a significant portion of humanity. China might eventually have a significant nuclear stockpile. But these and other countries are so dependent on each other launching a nuclear war is virtually unthinkable. Global Warming? The current projection based upon actual data is a warming of about 2C, possibly 3C by the year 2100. The could actually benefit humanity. Some sort of Ebola virus? No. We are spread out all over the Earth, and we have modern medicine and the ability to quarantine. In a billion years or so, the Sun will make life on Earth impossible. Will we have populated other planets by then? Possibly. Eventually, the heat death of the Universe will do Homo sapiens in.  So this leads to an important question: Are we just our bodies or do we have a God-given soul? If we have souls, then human life might end, but our true selves, our souls, will not end. If you think we are just physical beings, look at this beautifully written, but sad quote from the brilliant atheist Bertrand Russell: That Man is the product of causes that had no prevision of the end they were achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve individual life beyond the grave; that all the labors of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of Man's achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins. I don\u2019t know about you, but it seems better to think that we will live on forever, constantly doing God\u2019s will for us: Love God and Love all othersTreat others as they\u2019d like to be treatedUse you talents to make the world a better placeNot sure which philosophy to pick? Pick the one I gave above. All the good you\u2019ve done, all the love you\u2019ve expressed will never disappear. This is much better than Bertrand Russell\u2019s philosophy. And if I\u2019m wrong (although I\u2019m not) we\u2019d create a beautiful world that would eventually cease to exist. But we can create an Enlightened Civilization in either case. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cWill the human race ever go extinct?\u201d Thank you for the request to answer, Kara. This is a subject about which I have thought, a lot about. Partly, my thoughts have been in the direction of \u201cwhat could cause human extinction?\u201d and \u201cwhat are the possible time-frame, and the likelihood of each?\u201d. And I have researched \u201chow this type of thinking has become so commonplace\u201d. My conclusions, given all the possibilities I can think of, or find, are, in short: Q: WILL WE? The possibility, and time-frames of any potential existential threat to humanity are so statistically insignificant, and/or so astronomically long, as to be of no concern to any human alive today. In other words: NO. And\u2026 Q: WHY DO THESE THOUGHTS EXIST? Religion, Hollywood, Governments, Mental Illness, Human Nature, Lack of Information, or any combination therein. I don\u2019t mean to mention Mental Illness, and Human Nature in a judgmental, or accusatory sense. Not in any who wonders. Especially if they wonder, because they have had the thoughts planted by others. It is normal and understandable, if one hears a prediction, or assertion of impending doom, if such is a possibility. It is innocent to wonder. But in those who ASSERT we WILL, and in a time-frame that is significant to any alive today, I am willing to state that they are mentally ill. They suffer from narcissism, or messiah complex, or neurosis, or paranoia, of megalomania, or sociopathy, or depression, or some combination therein. They are not innocent. they are sick. Or guilty of taking advantage of the lack of knowledge of others, AND sick. Those are the short answers.  Here is a bit of supplementary information. Q: What would it take for humanity to go extinct? We would have to drop below 10,000 adults. We may even be able to survive and repopulate with fewer adults. The reason I mention 10,000? It is believed that about 75,000 years ago a volcano erupted that caused a drastic global cooling period which lasted about a 1,000 years. During which time the global population of humans dropped to about 10,000 adults.  image is a snapshot from: The Peopling of the World For more information you click on the link above and you can watch through the interactive slideshow, it is an well put together collection of how we believe humans grew into the global presence we are now. It is well worth the few minutes of time. For information on how they assembled this mapping of the journey of humans as we spread across the continents, click on this link: An Overview Now consider the number 10,000 adults. Some of our larger cruise ships hold almost that many, between passengers and crew. Some of our larger football and soccer stadiums hold more than 10x this number. And it is likely we would not need even a number as low as 10,000. Why? Our ability to survive is higher much greater than it was 75,000 years ago. We are more mobile. We have better ability to survive harsher weather. We have medicine. Agriculture. Ships and subs. Seed warehouses. Greenhouses. We have introvert fertilization. We have tools and resources to keep us warm, keep us cool. Get from one place to another. We have domesticated animals. So I suggest it is likely possible that 1,000 humans could repopulate the planet. Perhaps even less. Especially if they were together, not spread out all over the place. So when answering the question, \u201cWill humanity ever go extinct?\u201d, one of the things to consider is that for such to happen, it would take pretty much the destruction of the Earth, or such a change that all life, oceanic and land based would have to be wiped out. No illness can get to every corner of the world, every island, every ship, every remote settlement, ever tribe, every where. No nuclear war. No anything can get to all of the current billions of us, and reduce us to such low numbers.  There are multiple claims of how we might meet our doom, other than illness or nuclear war. I am aware of people who suspect we might meet our end at the hands of an alien invasion. Or by meteor strike. I have heard claims we need to watch out for the rise of AI. Or for human caused catastrophic climate change. A neutron star in our neighbourhood. A giant universal magnetic bubble coming at us faster than light speed. There are stories aplenty. ANY concern, Kara, or others, you might wish addressed specifically, put it in a comment, and I will add it here, and address it. Explain why, either due to odds, or time-frame, it is not of concern to us, here on Earth, today.  And if you wonder why I suggest that the people who assert we will meet our end are mostly motivated by Religion, Hollywood, Governments, Mental Illness, Human Nature, Lack of Information, or any combination therein, here is a list of people who at some point in history have made claims of impending doom and been incorrect. The list is pretty long. Take a peek at how they claim we will meet our end, and it will give you an idea of the source of the concepts they chose to publicly promote. Keep in mind, a good many, if not all, were mentally ill. List of dates predicted for apocalyptic events - Wikipedia It\u2019s OK to wonder about extinction. It is NOT OK to assert it is inevitable. It is most certainly not necessarily so. Ever. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s coming sooner then most think. Most of the human population have no control of what is happening to the earth, they are too poor. Many are religious and think there god will save them. But that is not happening. People just look out the window, no further then that! Most don\u2019t see what is happening to the world. They limit their thinking and just see what they want to see. They are afraid or don't care to see what is happening until it happens to them. Humans will wait, then try to take action to fix things when it is too late. Almost like an earthquake or major catastrophic event, people think it's not going to happen to them. Others yes but not them. I\u2019m sorry to say\u2026.Humans will cause their own extinction and at this time are taking many other creatures along with them. I call it the GOPP problem. I give humans less than 100 years then they will be gone, history, extinct. Slowly but surely and here are my reasons: G\u2026Greed. Not all, but to many feel like this, \"I don\u2019t care how much I pollute I need to be rich and richer. Let the others worry about it. Let the others clean up the trash\". Greed, wealth and power... It's a need for more and more things, homes, possessions. What's that old saying? \"He who dies with the most toys wins.\" Nothing else matters, which is causing so much more cheating to make even more money. In religion there is also so much greed. They have a great need for wealth and power. Study there history. Check out all the Religious wars. The money that the Muslim kings and Princes have, the castles they live in from all their oil. The Catholic Vatican in Rome has and hides so much money they could most likely feed the homeless worldwide. There are many rich religions where the preaches live very luxurious lives and there followers live in poverty. I don't see them living modestly, giving up there wealth and positions for the good of mankind. They pay little or NO taxes on anything.!! Land, buildings, hidden income, NONE. With there lies and corruption. They live great easy lives and promise that you go to heaven when you die, but be sure to give them your money before you leave. My father was a catholic and when he was dying, I was with him. Nuns from the church were there and told him to give them his money for a better place in heaven. Such greed, amazing bullshit. Government greed in all countries is overwhelming. They live in riches and keep the people in fear of change. That is the government's job, to keep the public afraid of all outsiders, of different kinds of government. Do not change a thing, it could cost you your life. We the government will make more weapons to protect you. Keep paying your taxes, keep us in power and wealth and we will protect you from all the evil out there. Now even more powerful then the government, you have the rich banks that control most of the world. They are not about to let anyone change things and cause them to lose any money, power or control. They are called \"The Four Horsemen of Banking\"... Bank of America, J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. These bankers also own the major oil companies, which are Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Chevron Texaco. There monopoly over global economy does not end at the end of the oil spill. They own most of all world companies. The names are: N.M. Rothschild of London, Rothschild Bank of Berlin, Warburg Bank of Hamburg, Warburg Bank of Amsterdam, Lehman Brothers of New York, Lazard Brothers of Paris, Kuhn Loeb Bank of New York, Israel Moses Seif Bank of Italy, Goldman Sachs of New York and JP Morgan Chase Bank of New York. They also own I would estimate 80 to 90% of the food companies. It\u2019s a world monopoly. These people pretty much own and run the world. They are a major part of causing the human extinction. It's not about the environment and human health, it's about profit, wealth and control. O\u2026Overpopulation. More people more pollution. Some say the population is not increasing. Doesn't matter, because there are too many humans now. More distruction of the rain-forest, jungles and other forms of life. Humans, like all creatures of the earth, by a natural biological instinct have a need to reproduce, to make more of themselves!!. It is just part of nature. Great inventions of medicine have kept humans alive longer. Eliminated almost all highly contagious diseases. It would be sad but maybe a new very contagious disease will kill off much of the population and slow down our extinction timeline. It would be better to slow down our birth rate with birth control, free for all the world. But Religion controls to much of the population and they are not going to let that happen. They need to increase their flock, for what? For more money and more control. So population increases might slow down but for the poor who have no say at all, it will stay the same or increase. P\u2026Pollution. Who\u2019s going to stop the drug companies, the oil companies and the pesticide companies from the pollution of the land, air, oceans, everything? Company slogans: \"Profit at ANY COST.\" There making too much money to stop! They are making billions of dollars every year. They knew they were and still are polluting for many years now. Many countries still burn coal. China broke its promise and is building more coal burning electric power plants. It puts mercury poison in the land and water. Some say they will stop in 20 years. How stupid can they be? Let the other guy fix it. Will the next war be with chemicals? Atomic? That will finish things off a little faster. The pollution is causing domestic animals, chickens, cows and fish to be full of pesticides and plastics. In much of the oceans, life is dying. The Japanese nuclear power plant that exploded a few years ago is still leaking into the ocean! People that love to swim and surf in the seas a lot are now getting sick from the heavy pollution. To feed the overpopulation you need to kill the insects with pesticides to save crops. There are better ways but this is cheaper and easier and a lot of money to be made. So they are not going to change. The beginning of the food chain for all land creatures are bugs, good and bad. We are losing so many birds and other animals to extinction. They controlled the bugs naturally. In Thailand and many so called third world countries, fisherman, instead of using nets or lines to catch fish are now using explosives. It kills all living things in the area of the explosion. They are killing their future source of food. But it's faster, easier, just stupid selfishness and greed. Even though the fish they will eat is full of pollution and micro-plastics. Nature on this earth is a fine balance, and humans are destroying it faster and faster! P\u2026. Plastics. I\u2019m sure you know what problem that is causing world wide. Scientist say that by 2030 there will be more plastics in the ocean than fish!! Almost everything is made out of plastic. Can humans live without it? I don't think so. Plastic waste from U.S., Australia and many countries was going to China to recycle but no longer. How much of it can be recycled? Fake companies are being formed to recycle plastics from other countries like some Indonesian countries. They take the plastics, you pay them to recycle it and they do nothing with it but let it pile up. They hide it among the trees and slowly it falls apart and blows away to the sea. China, Indonesia and India are very big polluters. The more countries develop the more pollution. But it really doesn't matter where it's coming from. It's helping the problem in a very large way. Plankton is the beginning life for the seas, which is now mixed with tiny plastic particles. The fish are eating and passing it on to the larger fish that eat them and it goes on to all ocean creatures. We have plastic inside our bodies now. Micro-plastics in chicken, dairy and meats that we all eat. Plastic is in bottled water. It's in cosmetics and in toothpaste. It's in many household products. It's in so many products it's hard to believe how many. It has PCBs and other toxic chemicals in it that leach out. What is it doing to the life on earth? Causing them to die off of disease and cancers. There are so many chemical accidents in the air, water and land. It's only sometimes on the news. Why isn't it in the news more often? Who owns the news media? The big corporations who only give the news they want you to know. Corporations owning news medias was illegal in the U.S. at one time years ago. They paid the government to change it. Some call it bribes, payoffs, kickbacks to change the rules of the game in corporations favor. Some say Climate change will cause human extinction. Doesn't matter if it gets hotter or colder. I think we will destroy ourselves along with climate change. Climate change will help spread the pollution much faster and just shorten the timeline to the human extinction. Some are saying that the magnetic poles are moving causing the climate change problem. Also the ozone hole in the atmosphere around the antarctic is getting larger. Ice melting causing the oceans to rise. The state of Florida around Miami area, they are building sea walls because now at high tide the streets are flooding. Humans are advancing in technology very fast, but will it be fast enough to save us and the earth as we know it? I would love to say yes but I just don't see it. There will be a few multimillionaires left in isolated places most likely with domes over there living areas, but will also soon die off. It is a sad thing to say........The Earth will evolve, living with different forms of life in a million years or so. Humans will not. ",

            "answer_text": "Homo sapiens will become extinct, sooner or later - it isn't a matter of if, but when. There is no way to accurately predict the future, so here are my best guesses: If it happens in the near future, the next few hundred or thousand years, it could be as a result of a global cataclysm, an asteroid strike or severe pandemic, for example. But it is perhaps more likely to be something of our own making, such as war, climate change, or a general human-overpopulation-induced ecological collapse -  the \"sixth extinction\", as written about at length by Richard Leakey and latterly Elizabeth Kolbert, seems to be well underway. We do not know at what point a more general ecological collapse may precipitate our own demise, through a collapse in food stocks, for example, as our environment is very interlinked. We may already have exterminated a key component of the biosphere and are merely counting down the clock.  None of the above would necessarily cause our total extinction, and a small population may be able to survive a pandemic, or ecological collapse, for example. But the tiny remaining population(s) that remained would find themselves facing very different challenges from the events that led to homo and their descendants in a few thousand generations would plausibly have evolved into a rather different primate. We may still have descendants, but they'd not be the same species as us: homo sapiens would be extinct.  In the medium term, humanity is statistically likely to become extinct some time in the next 800,000 years, based on the Background extinction rate of mammals. This is trickier; if we have made it beyond the next few hundred or thousand years, can we assume that we'd know better than to continue obliterating the environment through pollution, hunting, carbon emissions and so forth? I'd guess yes, and would assume if we make it this far, our demise is more likely to come from a pandemic, an asteroid/supernova, or a geological catastrophe (e.g. Yellowstone supervolcano erupting) which could all precipitate our extinction.  In the longer term if we survive our current issues, and develop technologically to the point that we can prevent asteroid impacts, supervolcanoes and all forms of pandemic, then we will face an issue by about 600 million years, as the increase in the sun's luminosity will increase temperatures and deplete the CO2 plants need. Around 1bn years from now, the average temperature of the earth will be too hot to support eukaryotes, or sustain liquid water.   This, obviously, would not bode well for humanity. But perhaps, with our lovely future technology, we could go to other planets and colonise the galaxy... ...In the very long term, if it is possible to travel across interstellar distances, we may be able to flee the Sol system and find a new home.  Of course, that wouldn't prevent the eventual inevitable fate of the universe: in about 100 quadrillion years the last main sequence star will go out, and then its just a long (and I mean long) slide into the degenerate era and the Heat death of the universe.  But don't worry; whatever goes extinct in the long or longer term won't be the same species as Genetic drift, the background Mutation rate and a host of other factors will mean we're no longer the same species, any more than modern day Coelacanths are the same species as those alive 400m years ago.  The human race as we know it will be long extinct by the end of the Universe, whatever happens. ",

Scientists have scanned space for meteors and asteroids so unless something unexpected happens it won't be a meteor\u2026.  But there are small matters like Yellow-Stone National Park. This super-volcano is 40,000 years overdue!  It would instantly plunge the entirety of North America into an Antarctic climate. The ash would blot out the light from the sun for at least 6 months. The Sun Dies The sun is in the middle of its life-cycle but in a few billion years it will engulf the earth. It is likely that if humans have survived that long we would have found a way to colonize planets outside the Solar System.  This will destroy the earth entirely and then mars and our chances of living on rocky planets in our solar system end. The Ultimate Heat Death of the Universe Eventually the universe will spread out till all energy is distributed equally across the universe. Everything will sit at -273 degrees celsius or absolute zero this will happen. There is no getting around this  There is no getting around the Second Law of Thermodynamics. A Fatal Pathogen Well this is ironic timing, thankfully this strain of coronavirus doesn't seem like it will cause extinction. There are many ways a pathogen could wipe out the human race without just killing everyone. It could attack the Y-Chromosome so there would be no men. It could make females sterile. A large number of pathogens could end the human race. But most likely\u2026. us I doubt nuclear warfare could make the entirety of humanity to go extinct but a chemical or biological weapon could easily eradicate humanity\u2026  (Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the nuclear bomb spoke these words as it detonated: \u201cI am Death, Destroyer of Worlds\u2026\u201d) ",

            "answer_text": "The extinction of our species is inevitable, but not imminent. It will however definitely happen in the long run. Being completely wiped out (Which you probably meant), is highly unlikely. Extinction happens when the last member of a species dies. On average a species lives for about 10 million years. 99% of all species that ever lived are extinct today. This usually happens due to speciation where a species evolves into new species which then competes for the same resources. It is like the homo erectus is now extinct, but it's not like they all died, they just evolved into homo sapiens (us). So yes, our species will keep evolving ever so slightly until the differences are big enough to consider our descendants a new species. A wipe out, where all humans are killed of at once, or in a short time span, leaving no genetic ancestors, is highly unlikely. Since our species has been spread all across the globe, at almost every place imaginable. A complete wipe out would require a global catastrophic event. There aren't many like that possible and their chances are extremely slim and close to nil. Especially since it is highly likely that our species will even start to colonize the solar system in the next millenium (a 1000 years is a heartbeat in astronomical terms), which would require a solar wide catastrophe to wipe all of us out, which is even more unlikely and is close to impossible. So you can rest assured, humans will stick around for a long LONG time. And our descendant species will do even longer. Even in case of a human invoked disaster, such as a global war, there will most likely always remain a last man standing. Sure it might cause a technological fallback and life might be harsh for those who survived, but we'll still be here. The caveman life wasn't a walk in the park either, but we managed. We have pretty much already proven our resilience without technology. ",

            "answer_text": "Question: Will the human race ever go extinct? If every human stays on Earth, then yes, certainly. There are a number of ways our planet can experience an extinction-level event and other answerers have done a fine job talking about those. But, we don\u2019t go extinct before our technology develops to the point where we can leave Earth, then that\u2019s another story. Most scientists accept that there is life elsewhere in the universe. There are more than 100 billion galaxies, each of which contains approximately 100 billion stars, many of which likely contain multiple planets and moons. It\u2019s highly unlikely our little planet is the only place that life developed (if life did, indeed, first develop here instead of being brought here by, say, a meteor). So, statistically speaking, there is life out there. Now, what we don\u2019t know is how similar is that life to what we\u2019re used to, if there is intelligent life, if the nearest extraterrestrial life is close enough that we\u2019ll ever be able to reach it. Arguably, the world of Star Trek is not so far-fetched. Imagine a scenario like that, where humans are spread throughout the galaxy (and, possibly, beyond). If there are hunan colonies (or colonies where human live) on hundreds or thousands of planets throughout the universe, it\u2019s hard to see how all humans will ever go extinct. An extinct level event on Earth might kill all humans living in Earth, but humankind would still live on in many other places. The question then becomes: will humanity develop the technology to populate other planets before humans are wiped off the face of the Earth? And, that is something I can\u2019t answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but hopefully it\u2019s Option A. I think these are the likeliest causes of human extinction: Option A: The heat death of the universe. We\u2019re not going to make it past that. The less plausible the rest of this list is, the more plausible this option is. Option B: An artificial intelligence that can do any cognitive task a human being can do. For justifications that this is a real risk, I\u2019m going to link you elsewhere, since there is a lot of ground to cover. But here\u2019s the three sentence version. We have our dominant position because of intelligence. If something smarter than us did not share our values, it would be hostile to us, and it would defeat us. It is very hard to figure out how to successfully encode values into a computer program that we would actually want optimized. Here is an article I wrote that goes into more detail, but is still only an introduction. Here is an article that describes what eminent AI researchers think of all this. This is the book on the topic out of Oxford. This is a paper on why we can\u2019t just put a human-level intelligent AI in a sealed box and be fine. Here is an outline of some of the current research directions that people are working on to try to mitigate this risk. The rest of these are much less likely than either A or B. I put Option C at 1% and the rest at less than 10^-5. Option C: A pandemic. If a disease had the contagiousness of influenza, the incubation period of small pox, and the morbidity of rabies, that might just finish us. I\u2019m using examples of real diseases to make this seem as plausible as I can. That said, one person has survived rabies[1], so maybe this imagined pandemic would have to have a morbidity beyond any disease that we have ever encountered. That, of course, makes this less plausible. Option D: The sun expands and gets hot enough to make Mars uninhabitable. This will happen in a few billion years. That is our clock for developing interstellar travel. Given how much we\u2019ve accomplished in the last couple hundred though, and given that we have tens of millions of such intervals in the future, I think we have plenty of time. Never too early to start though, so Elon Musk is doing the right thing here. Option E: The sun expands and gets hot enough to make Earth uninhabitable. This will happen in about a billion years. This seems even less likely that Option D to me, since it doesn\u2019t seem that hard to get to Mars and make it\u2019s atmosphere livable, and a billion years is quite a while. Complete and permanent civilizational collapse is necessary for this to be the eventuality; not just civilizational collapse for a few thousand years. Option F: Nuclear War. Most models have Australia and New Zealand surviving[2], so the risk of this option is really just the risk that those models are wrong. I trust the experts here, but it would be silly not to allow at least a tiny probability that they are wrong. Option G: HUUUGE asteroid. We survived the last asteroid, and our technology has gotten a lot better since then. Not too worried about this one. Here are some non-options that people are often concerned about. Non-option A: Global warming. Global warming will suck, and it will probably be a bigger ethical catastrophe than anything that has ever happened. But in order for global warming to wipe us out entirely, we would need to burn about 10 times as much coal, oil, and natural gas as currently exists in the earth\u2019s crust.[3] I also offer a more complete picture here in a very short post (much shorter than this one). Non-option B: Normal sized asteroid. As mentioned above. I think that this answer represents something close to what people at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk would say, but I suspect there are also minor differences. That\u2019s the next place I\u2019d head to if you\u2019re interested in more opinions. Footnotes [1] Medical Mystery: Only One Person Has Survived Rabies without Vaccine--But How?

            "answer_text": "The time for the world to be destroyed by climate change disasters has long been past due. Humans have gone extinct except for one species, homo sapiens. There is no guarantee that this last species will survive any great cataclysm. And the reason is that the people of the world have for too long been guilty of the pre-original sin of overpopulation, with over-exploitation of the natural resources and environmental damage, which has induced punitive climate change. Please see Mohammad Gani's answer to When did mankind first start harming the planet? But predictions of apocalyptic destruction of humanity have always been made, and always proved to be false. List of dates predicted for apocalyptic events - Wikipedia The reason? There are always a bunch of cowards who hate themselves, have no self-confidence, and feel guilty about some kind of sin they have committed. The illiterate peasants had for thousands of years felt they they were guilty of the original sin. The original sin was that the first ancestors ate some forbidden fruit. Now, there are literate people who cannot count so that they cannot interpret data. These innumerate people have no sense of proportion, such that they have no idea whether an 8-inch increase of sea water in 100 years is a big or small event. People of Bangladesh in the Gangetic delta, or of Vietnam in the Mekong Delta or of China in their river deltas are quite able to float boats over hundreds of inches of water, and think just nothing of an eight inch rise in the water level. But the innumerate thinks that their pre-original sin has caught up with them, and the world is going to drown under 1 inch of water in the next 10 years. To these people, the pre-original sin is that people tilled and turned the soil to grow fruits even before they ate the forbidden fruit. It took a whole century for the temperature to rise by just 2 degrees Fahrenheit, which is nothing in the ordinary scale of daily temperature change. But those who think that they are sinners and overdue for a severe punishment cannot wait for the big punishment to come down soon enough. To them, the divine retribution in the form of a climate disaster is long overdue. According to the grandfather of environmental science, Paul Ehrlich, India is long overdue the destruction if its overpopulated overpopulation. Indians were due to starve to death by 1980, as per prediction made by Ehrlich in 1968. So, India is not likely to survive another minute, having already lived 40 years more than allowed by Ehrlich. So, in summary, the humans are at least 40 years overdue for extinction, to the extent that they are Indians. ",

            "answer_text": "Pretty high chance of this happening, actually, as our current world population is taxing the natural environment to its limit. This is compounded by the fact that we have far fewer trees in our rainforests than 50 years ago, and thus have removed a very large portion of our planet\u2019s ability to create oxygen for us to breathe. Add to this the fact that our combined ability to pollute the air and sometime in the not-too-distant future there probably won\u2019t be enough oxygen for humans to breathe. I\u2019d say this is probably likely to happen within the next 200 years because our population growth rate has been increasing exponentially for decades. Back in the 1990s our population broke the 6 billion mark. Barely a decade later\u2026 7 billion. So this is one possibility: our planet can no longer sustain human life and we will experience a mass extinction event. Those with the means and ability to procure their own oxygen supply will fare well albeit many of those people will focus on this to the exclusion of many other things. This means that most 3rd-world countries will experience drastic population decreases as they lack access to sufficient oxygen -storing and -generating facilities. I suppose in some cruel fashion this may work in our favor as the birth rate in 3rd-world countries tends to be much higher than first-world nations. Four nations - the EU (sort of), China, the USA, and India - together account for about half of the world\u2019s population. The remaining half will be in serious trouble. I\u2019d argue to include China in that list as some of their cities have huge air pollution problems, but I don\u2019t actually know enough about China overall to make an informed opinion. Thus, the nations that contribute the most to our overall population growth rate will experience significant declines in their population because they are starving for oxygen among their many other poorly-met needs. Most of Africa will experience massive population drops, and likewise all over Asia. so 1) our planet can barely (or stops) sustaining life Then there\u2019s #2: climate change. It\u2019s not just ever-worsening extremes of weather, it\u2019s also an increased rate of crop failures. Some people say this was the very event in the beginning that triggered the current unrest in Syria. If this is true then this may be indicative of much of our future. #3: fresh waterWe are already experiencing problems with this in the USA. Florida and Georgia have been at it together for much of the last two decades over water rights on the large St. John\u2019s River. California\u2019s water troubles have been getting worse by the year. And the Oogalala[sp] Aquifer that runs under much of the midwest is running out of water. If first-world nations are having severe problems procuring large stocks of fresh water then this problem is probably far worse in developing nations and also likely to get much worse. #4: nuclear powerThe threat isn\u2019t from the USA and Russia enacting MAD on each other, but rather on lone wolves smuggling in dirty bombs into massive population centers (Shanghai, Tokyo, NYC, London, Berlin) and detonating them. We\u2019re barely keeping pace with advancing technology that continues to find new ways to attempt to smuggle in small nuclear/chemical/biological weapons. I\u2019d say there is a very high chance that, in the next 200 years, we will be dealing with large amounts of one of the four problems I described above. Hell, two of them we\u2019re already dealing with now! ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWe\u2019ll never survive!\u201d \u201cNonsense! You\u2019re only saying never because no one ever has.\u201d - Buttercup & Wesley, The Princess Bride Funny thing about death - no one ever beats it. In the end, it comes for everyone. That means, eventually, the human race will go extinct. Of course, just pointing out that everyone dies doesn\u2019t prove anything, as there is a very important difference between a single human and the human race. After all, we replace our numbers, given time, with new members of our species. So this is akin to my bathtub analogy - if you have a bathtub with water in it, with some water going in and some water going out, will the bathtub drain all the way or will it fill to overflowing? Answer: Cannot be determined, as we don\u2019t know how much water is going in and how much is going out. So let\u2019s take a different look at it. First, the human race might very well do itself in. There are plenty of signs of it, so whether or not it happens, there is certainly the possibility. Assuming that it doesn\u2019t do itself in, won\u2019t the human race go extinct when the sun goes nova? Well, maybe, but that presumes that the human race doesn\u2019t manage somehow to escape to another stellar system. What about the heat death of the universe? Or the Big Crunch? Or whatever happens to cause the universe to die? That will kill every human in existence, won\u2019t it? Sure, but there\u2019s no guarantee that the descendants of humanity won\u2019t have learned how to skip universes, start anew. So humanity could exist forever? Erm\u2026 no. Did you notice how I said \u201cthe descendants of humanity\u201d? Not \u201chumanity\u201d or \u201chumans\u201d, but the \u201cdescendants of humanity\u201d. It\u2019s a funny thing, evolution. Species that have been around for a while, they all eventually die off. But their descendants, new species entirely, they might live on. 6 million years ago, humanity shared a common ancestor with the chimpanzees. That ancestor is no more, but both homo sapiens and our closest cousins survive. Kind of important there - our closest cousins. We had sibling humans before. The most famous of them was the Neanderthals. Where are they now? Gone. What happened to them? We did, most likely. Eventually, some day, if humanity lasts long enough, the descendants of humanity will have become a new species, unlike what humans are today, and when the last human recognizable to the humans of today are gone, then the human race will be truly gone. It may take a while. Millions of years, if, again, humanity doesn\u2019t do itself in first. There could be new human species that emerge, emerge and die off, emerge and survive and live on past homo sapiens. These new humans could still be considered humans, the sibling human race to the long-extinct homo sapiens. But they too will pass on, and their descendants will be even less like homo sapiens. They may still be considered humans, and the human race will continue a while longer, but in the end, what makes the human race will perish. Whether you take comfort in that or not, I leave to you.

It\u2019s possible that we destroy ourselves via nuclear war or destruction of the environment which causes a cascading collapse of ecosystems we rely on. In both those cases it is likely that some humans would survive but there is no guarantees that the survivors would be able to restart humanity and might survive for a while but ultimately die out from radiation or just plain lack of knowledge since most of the people making your food and clean water are specialist jobs but very few know how to do it all and there is a steep learning curve in an unforgiving environment. Then there are the mass plagues that could wipe us out, it just takes one disease with the right factors that is highly contagious but slow enough in killing us that it spreads to enough of the population to collapse our society. If you think about it we are pretty weak animals, the power goes out for a day in summer and thousands of people died because they didn\u2019t have air conditioning. We have a squirrel in our back yard that is still playing in the snow and has endured weeks of -20 degree cold by nesting in a pile of leaves, what percentage of the population would die if everyone on earth had to live just one winter naked in the snow getting their own food and water? Then you have the global killers like planetary impact, a nearby star going supernova, or mass corona ejections that would severely destroy the whole planet so it\u2019s really dealers choice. What extinction would you prefer? ",

            "answer_text": "Humans won\u2019t become extinct, but they will devolve more and more as Kali-yuga progresses. In fact, the human race disproves Darwin\u2019s theory. In earlier ages humans were much more advanced and evolved than they are today. The Vedic literature and culture testify to that fact. At a time when, according to evolutionists, the people of Europe ran around with clubs and lived in caves, the sages of the Vedic culture had already described advanced mathematics, the number 0, the decimal number system, and all the planets in our solar system in minute detail. Of course, they don\u2019t teach you that in school, not even in India. Modern man has a tendency to scorn and scoff at the Vedic culture and literature, which, according to them, are merely the products of some primitive jungle-dwellers that lived in India long time ago. But what kind of primitive jungle-dwellers would write in a language that is so perfect in grammar and composition that it takes modern linguists at least 10 years to even master the basic grammar? Most students of linguistics today agree that Sanskrit is the oldest language and probably the mother of all other languages. What kind of primitives would more than 5000 years ago formulate units of time based on the movements of atoms rating from 1/10.000 parts of a second up to the total duration of the universe? (Re. Bhagavat Purana 3.11.1-12) What kind of primitives would give an exact description of the planets in our solar-system, some of which have only recently been discovered by modern science? Not to speak of planets in the universe that are still unknown to scientists. (Re. Srimad Bhagavatam, Surya Siddhanta, and most Puranas) What kind of primitives would be able to list and categorize all existing species of life in the universe according to their conscious development, including 400.000 human species? (Re. Padma Purana) How is it that the Vedic literature (the product of some primitive jungle dwellers, ie.) contain highly systematic and detailed knowledge on such things as: Medicine Ayurveda and Garuda Purana contain a highly sophisticated science of medicine and diagnosis. A skilled Ayurvedic doctor can determine your disease and its cure by taking the pulse three places on the wrist. There are Ayurvedic clinics in most of the world today and they are highly appreciated and successful. Music Vedic music is of the most intricate and complicated in the world, where certain rythms and scales are connected with certain moods and times of day (raga). It was known in Vedic culture that certain sound vibrations affect the mind in different ways. Politics The political structure of Vedic society allowed the population to live peaceful, prosperous lives under saintly kings and rulers, who possessed keen insight into human psychology. The Varnasrama-dharma social system guaranteed that everyone was engaged according to their psycho-physical make-up, at the same time ensuring they could gradually advance in spiritual realization culminating in ultimate liberation from the material world. All continents were known and regular trade and exchanges took place. (Re. Mahabharata, Bhagavat and other Puranas) Architecture The construction of temples and other buildings were conducted according to scriptural injunctions (Shilpa sastra). To this day it is possible to observe some of the wonders of Vedic architecture (Kanchi Puram and Jagannath Puri to just mention a few).There are still impressive buildings constructed from solid blocks of stone that has not even been surpassed by the most advanced modern technology. The walls were imbued with precious stones (they were all later plundered by invading Moslems and British). Those buildings had air condition based on a system of water canals, perfect acoustics etc. The carvings in stone speak for themselves. In the Puranas we find descriptions of interiors which by far surpasses any modern equivalent, with furniture decorated with precious stones and indoor swimming pools. These descriptions are collaborated in the writings of Moguls and other invaders (1100 - 1500 AD), as well as the Diary of an India Traveller by Tavernier, who was also the one who brought the Hope and Koh-i-noor diamons to Europe. Mathematics It is from the Vedas (Shulba sastra) that we have the decimal system, the number 0, equations with unknown factors represented by letters, and the modern system of numbers. The first examples of arithmetic, cubic roots, geometry, and trigonometry, are to be found in the Vedas, and it was Aryabhatta in 1497 who calculated Pi to be 3.1416. War fare During the Vedic times it was only Kshatriyas (members of the warrior caste) that were engaged in war and violence.Civilians were never involved in or victims of acts of war, which were always conducted on remote battlefields according to specific rules and regulations. To name a few examples, one who turned his back, one who was afraid or panicking, one who was confused, or someone who ran away, was not to be harmed or killed. The fighting ceased as soon as the sun set. Warriors who possessed heavenly weapons (weapons released by mantra) would only use them against warriors who also possessed them. Vedic soldiers knew about a psychic technology which is unknown today, and which enabled them to release elements like fire, water, or air and direct them against an enemy. They could also by mantra release what is known as the brahmastra, the ultimate destructive weapon, which is a controlled, localized atomic weapon (Re. Mahabharata and Bhagavat Purana). The Dhanur Veda was the Veda that described the art of war. After the battle on Kurukshetra the brahmins placed a curse on it to ensure that it could not be used any more in Kali-yuga. Art Drama, theater, poetry, sculpture, dance, and other arts are being described in minute detail in the Vedic literature. The carvings decorating temples, Bharat-natyam and other forms of dance, as well as the more than 3 million stanzas that constitute the Vedic literature in and of itself prove that the Vedic tradition was extremely sophisticated regarding the arts and sciences. It is said that only 7 percent of the Vedic literature has survived. A great deal of temples, scripture, and libraries were systematically being destroyed by Muslim invaders. Besides, many other subject matters are being delineated in the Vedas - spiritual, metaphysical, philosophical as well as worldly subjects dealing with economics, psychology and sense-enjoyment. How could primitive jungle dwellers have knowledge about all of that? How did the even know how to read and write? How could they describe the planetary orbits and predict solar and moon eclipses? How did they know that matter consists of atoms? If they knew all these things, why then assume that they would just speculate and fantasize about the extensive knowledge in the Vedic literature that describes God, the soul, the world and all existential questions? Krishna says: My dear Arjuna, because you are never envious of Me, I shall impart to you this most confidential knowledge and realization, knowing which you shall be relieved of the miseries of material existence. (Bg. 9.1) This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed. (Bg. 9.2) I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas, I am to be known. Indeed, I am the compiler of Vedanta, and I am the knower of the Vedas. (Bg. 15.15)  ",

            "answer_text": "By extinction you mean a total wipe-out, or that not a single human being remains alive, right? So first let's see what can actually do it (in no particular order): Natural: Big asteroid/comet impact. Statistically speaking this is not very likely but still possible. But worst of all, if it happens we'll be utterly defenseless against it at this point in time. The number of people who officially watch the night sky for the purpose of detecting those \"mankind killers\" is less than can run a single MacDonald's. And general population and politicians usually won't do a thing about it until it actually hits us. Unfortunately when that happens it will be too late. Let me explain. For instance, if we notice that a 10 mile wide asteroid is about to impact the Earth (the one similar to what wiped out dinosaurs) even a seemingly sufficient warning of several years will not be enough to do anything about it at the level of technology we possess today. (And please disregard what you saw in Hollywood and in popular culture.) If it happens now, it will be a very bleak time to live, when we'll know that the big rock is coming but there's nothing we can do about it. But, like I said, the chances of a big dinosaur killer-like asteroid impacting us now are very slim.Self-inflicted: Overpopulation -> Global war. To see how this can impact us you just need to do the math. Currently our Western society, technology and development in medicine allowed the population of humans to grow exponentially. This means that the overall human population will continue to grow at an ever increasing pace.Here's a quote from Stephen Hawking: \"... But the present exponential growth can not continue for the next millennium. By the year 2600 the world's population would be standing shoulder to shoulder and the electricity consumption would make the Earth glow red hot.\"This obviously causes a problem -- our resources are quite finite. So what happens when multiple groups of people compete for a scarce resource? War. Unfortunately throughout our development humans also invented means to greatly inflict damage upon one another, i.e. we have nuclear weapons. It is hard to see whether or not we will be able to completely annihilate ourselves with the use of nukes but we can surely get really close to it. In that case this will throw our technological progress to many centuries back and shrink human population to a total bottleneck (say, of just several thousands of breeding individuals) to what it used to be roughly about 70 thousand years ago.Self-inflicted: Genetic mistake. This one is a hypothetical scenario, since we do not possess this technology yet, and thus is highly unlikely. This is something that will be developed throughout this 21-st century. I'm referring to the genetic bio-engineering, or when humans will be able to adjust our own genes. Don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful development that can cure a myriad of horrible and totally preventable genetic diseases, but it can also lead to a very painful (albeit hypothetical) mistake if applied too carelessly. Genetics and evolution is a somewhat tricky process that plays out through many years and via many generations. So a gene introduced by humans several generations back as a perfect fix, may later prove to be detrimental to human survival, a gene, then present in most humans, that causes a fatal mutation down the generational line. Such scenario could potentially serve as a cause for an extinction. If such happens, the only way to prevent this deadly gene from spreading on is to eliminate it, or kill off those affected humans, or prevent them from breeding. But at this point we may be talking about billions of people (at the current rate of human growth, see item above.) So one can play this scenario even further to see that it leads to a major human conflict, or war, that I described above.Self-inflicted: New life form mistake. And lastly, this one is a total science fiction at this point. Although there is some evidence that it may happen in the next 200 years and on. If we invent a more resilient, self-replicating life form, meaning that it can survive better than us, it can potentially take over and push us out, i.e. kill us. (Obviously not like they showed in the Terminator series.) There's a precedent of this already happening in history. There's some evidence that we caused the extinction of Neanderthals by interbreeding with them and thus disrupted their epigenome that caused their die-off. (It is highly contested though.) Here's an article on that subject.So if you ask me, how likely is it that humans will go extinct in the near future? And whether or not you should be really worried about it? I would say NO! The outlook for the next 100 years (the life span of most people that are alive today) is pretty good. So enjoy it! ",

            "answer_text": "There are many ways for humans to go extinct. I've touched on this subject on another question. The first way to go is war. A war that will literally, not figuratively, end all wars. This war of biblical proportions will see entire nations destroyed completely and no human is spared. A terrible war of attrition, genocide, and worse. Every weapon known to man will likely be used which would create a very dangerous environment wrought with chemical poisoning, man-made diseases running rampant, and probably worse still, a nuclear winter. With so much devastation, many plants and animals too would suffer as bystanders to the most apocalyptic extinction event. It will take the earth about\u2026 maybe a thousand years or so to fully be able to harbor life once again and future archeologists would be stunned at such destruction and the suddenness of the extinction of mankind. Secondly, the next path in which mankind would go extinct is by a global superplague. Much like many plagues of old, this plague, however, will kill all of humanity starting with the most populated areas such as cities, before ending with the last remnants of humanity dying alone either in lonesome caves, tents, or homes. After which, nature would do the rest. Future archeologists would ponder over the mass extinction of humanity that took place over several decades or centuries. To broach the fantastical, the third form of man's extinction is a zombie apocalypse. Zombies consume humanity, nature consumes zombies, and thus ends mankind in a bitter struggle. Lastly, a slight touch on plagues is a reenactment of the first Europeans coming to the Americas in the form of alien colonizers coming to Earth. The aliens come, their diseases are introduced to our population in which as we fight against the aliens, we are brought low by their common disease. The last of us would either die by fighting the aliens, killed by their disease, or for those who survived the plague and conflict, interbreed with the aliens until the human population goes the way of the neanderthal. So yeah, all in all, I'd place my money on a Worldwide War. ",

            "answer_text": "There is certainly a HIGHLY possible pathway. Simply convince people they don\u2019t have souls. That would be enough to wipe out the entire human race. You don\u2019t even have to convince everybody. Theoretically just one would be enough. Here, let Michael Stone explain this. He explains this FAR better than I can. Michael Stone will show you how the Slaughter can happen\u2014-IS happening, RIGHT NOW, under your very nose\u2014-step by inevitable, inexorable step. Michael Stone will make it CRYSTAL-clear, make it REAL\u2014- The following is a story I have posted before on Quora. All the content, every single word, is entirely my own work. Here is a link to the original Quora source: Jeff Corkern's answer to What is the most realistic Everyone Dies\u2122 scenario? Here is a link to the story at The Nine Point Five Theses Website: http://theninepointfivetheses.bl... ) [EXCERPT] AND NOTHING HEARD MY SCREAM by Jeffrey A. Corkern My path was long and hard. My path was sheer, raw pain. My path had driven me to the banks of the Mississippi River, to journey through clouds of dense, confusing fog, to struggle my way over large slabs of shifting, shattered, cruel rock. The fog dragged at my skin with clammy fingers. Ice needles stabbed my lungs with each labored breath. Vicious chill sucked the heat out of my shivering body. The fog covered the riverbank with dank gray formlessness, the rocks with slick, wet, treachery. I stepped. A slab teetered and slipped from under me. I staggered and went down face-first onto a merciless edge, into starburst red agony. I rose spitting blood and continued on, wondering what the purpose was for it all, if there were any meaning for my pain, if there were any meaning at all. I had been born onto this path, into this world, this Darwinian jungle world. This was all the reality I had ever known. The journeys of others were easy. Mine was not. My journey had always been one of suffering and solitude, to my constant wondering and bewilderment. I walked alone, as I always had, always would, in my pocket the only safety I could trust, a forty-five automatic, banging against my hip. I came upon a dark form, a stranger rendered faceless by the fog. \u201cHello,\u201d the stranger said. He wore a thick coat that kept him warm and safe from the fog's hungry cold. A child of the soft paths, a child of privilege. \u201cWho are you?\u201d \u201cI am Michael Stone. And you?\u201d \u201cI am,\u201d the stranger replied, \u201cJust Plain Old Skeptic. Did you know there are no souls?\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d I asked. Deep inside me, a spark of anger flared at the Universe\u2019s infinite cruelty. \u201cHow do we know this?\u201d \u201cThe greatest scientific geniuses in all of history have assured us souls don\u2019t exist.\u201d \u201cI have long suspected as much,\u201d I said. The spark flashed into a flame of rage, into a light that illuminated and distilled all the experiences of my journey into one blinding insight. \u201cIf there are no souls, the only rational thing to be is a sociopath.\u201d Just Plain Old Skeptic smiled, a streak of white smeared against the blur. \u201cWhat an absurd statement,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are a silly woo.\u201d The statement stunned me. What a complete fool. I looked around for witnesses. We were an island of two in the fog, alone and isolated, beyond the reach of all justice. I raised my arm and pointed behind Just Plain Old Skeptic. \u201cLook,\u201d I said, \u201cbehind you. It is the great genius Dawkins himself.\u201d Just Plain Old Skeptic actually turned his back to me to look. I drew the forty-five silent as a ghost, brought the muzzle to the side of his head and squeezed the trigger. In the fog, the crack of the round was flat and lifeless. Just Plain Old Skeptic became Just Plain Dead Skeptic. Red and gray brains pattered like gentle raindrops over the Mississippi's surface. Just Plain Old Skeptic pitched forward onto the rocks and was still. I pulled that fine, warm coat off his body and put it on. \u201cDo you see it now?\u201d I asked him. I flicked his brains off a sleeve. \u201cNow is it clear?\u201d I ran my hand over silken cloth as warmth spread through my being. \u201cOnce I was cold. Now I am warm. And all it will ever cost me is this spent shell. How my action affected you will never affect me. How was my action not rational?\u201d I bent over and picked up the spent shell. I looted the rest of Just Plain Old Skeptic's body and eased him into the river. A gator rose and drew him under, and Just Plain Old Skeptic turned to nothing, disappeared, gone, wiped out, vanished, zeroed, ERASED, like he had never been. I continued on my journey, slipping and struggling over rock, feeling a deep sense of confirmation. My anger at the Universe grew, into a knife of rage in my guts, a knife that twisted and burned, aching for release. Another faceless stranger rose in the fog. \u201cHello,\u201d he said. His skin was soft and unmarked, without a single scar. Another child of ease. \u201cI am Sternly Rational.\u201d \u201cHello,\u201d I said. \u201cI am Michael Stone. Did you know there are no souls?\u201d \u201cI do indeed,\u201d he said. \u201cAll smart and strong people know this.\u201d \u201cTo the Universe, you and I are nothing, then,\u201d I said. \u201cHuman beings are nothing. We come and are gone like puffs of mist. The Universe is cruel beyond belief.\u201d \u201cYou have grasped a hard truth,\u201d Sternly Rational replied. He cast his hand at the sky. \u201cWhat is puny, weak, ephemeral Man, that the mighty Universe must be mindful of him?\u201d \u201cTo the Universe, zero,\u201d I said, \u201cless than the dust beneath our feet. Our thoughts, our actions, have no physically real meaning in the end.\u201d \u201cI see you are one of the smart and strong who can grasp this hard truth and not hide from its sting, as am I,\u201d Sternly Rational said. \u201cOne must pity those who lack the strength to face this, who must take refuge from the Great Emptiness in the delusions of religion.\u201d \u201cHow should I act, knowing this?\u201d I asked. My question took Sternly Rational by surprise. He stepped back in puzzlement. \u201cI can't see how this would have any effect on how you should act,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven't thought about it. What do you think it means?\u201d \u201cMy actions are free and uninhibited,\u201d I said. I drew my forty-five. \u201cSince I do not exist eternally, I can escape the consequences of my actions.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Sternly Rational asked in a confused tone. \u201cI don't understand.\u201d \u201cI may do as I wish,\u201d I said. \u201cWithout an immortal soul, the Universe began when I was born and will end when I die. I am therefore absolutely alone, a Universe of One. Anything I can get away with is rational.\u201d I aimed and fired. \u201cAny feeling of connection I might have to the rest of humanity is strictly false and an illusion.\u201d I missed my shot. Instead of smashing his head, I tore Sternly Rational's throat out, a red raw-meat wound like a great gaping mouth slashed open underneath his chin. Sternly Rational put his hand to his throat and made a gargling sound of terrible surprise. He folded over onto the rocks making wet, bloody sounds. He wasn\u2019t dead. It wasn't safe to approach. I backed away and sat down to wait while Sternly Rational twitched and jerked and became Sadly Rational. I thought and watched a red stream flow into a brown one, bloom out into the water, and fade away. I brooded over the implications of this new fundamental insight as it spread throughout humanity. The Universe didn't care. I was nothing. All humanity was nothing. Pressure clamped down on my mind from all sides, gentle, inescapable, inexorable, raw evolution itself, growing into pain as my understanding deepened. For every human being I met, if he could kill me for whatever I had and get away with it---that was the smart thing for him to do. This was a newly discovered physical truth, the way the Universe was, an evolutionary force. Every single person I met was now a potential killer, everywhere, all the time, forever. The smarter he was, the more likely he would be to kill me. What would this new physical truth mean for the human race? Society was intrinsically unstable. What would this new physical truth do to the human race? I felt a society, an entire world, crashing down in flames. The flowing stopped. I rose, picked up the spent shell, and looted Sternly Rational's body. I rolled Sternly Rational's flaccid body to the river, tumbling it over the rocks. He went in without a splash. Another gator rose and pulled him down in a swirl of water and Sternly Rational turned to nothing, disappeared, gone, wiped out, vanished, zeroed, ERASED, like he had never been. I continued down my path. The rage, the fire, jumped in me, roared and built up white-hot in my guts, began transforming me, forging me into a new being, evolving me. A line of V's formed in the river behind me as the gators followed. Around me, the confusing fog began to lift, rising to clarity, rising to final revelation. I heard a bell ringing from high up on the riverbank\u2019s top. The sound cut through the fog with a ring as clear as pure water. I looked up and saw a female dressed in a military uniform standing next to a small pot suspended from a tripod, swinging a bell back and forth. \u201cAlms, kind sir!\u201d she called to me. \u201cFar, far away in a distant land, untold thousands of innocent people are dying from lack of food! Alms, kind sir, for the relief of the starving! Alms, kind sir, for the love of God!\u201d Far, far away? I felt a strong tug of connection, but contemptuously dismissed it for the lie it really was. They were not connected to me. There was no physical reason I should be concerned. Only if I had a soul would that be a smart thing to do. They were nothing. I wanted what I had for me. This was only evolution. Let evolution take its natural course. Let the innocent starve to death. That was safer. The less people there were, the safer I was. I passed her and her ringing bell by. Another faceless stranger appeared in my path, clad in expensive clothing, fat, well-fed. The gators sank out of sight to safety, like the perfect Darwinian sociopaths they were, to await my gift. \u201cI am Michael Stone,\u201d I said. I gripped the forty-five in my pocket. \u201cThere are no souls.\u201d \u201cI am Na\u00efve Skeptic,\u201d the stranger replied. \u201cOf course there are not. Such a transparently foolish, impossible notion, clearly born out of desperation and fear of death.\u201d \u201cPeople everywhere will soon finally realize what that means,\u201d I said. \u201cKilling is smart. A rational thing to do to get what you want.\u201d \u201cOh, fudge,\u201d Na\u00efve Skeptic said, with the blindness of a lifetime of comfort. \u201cPeople would never do such a horrible thing. People are nice.\u201d \u201cPeople are not nice,\u201d I said, drew and fired. Na\u00efve Skeptic snapped backward with a little round hole in the front of his head and a big round hole in the back. He lay on the rocks staring up at the sky with a permanent stare, Forever Wide-Eyed Skeptic. \u201cPeople are smart. \u2018Homo nice\u2019 is not what people are. People are Homo sapiens, Homo smart. That's what people are.\u201d I picked up the spent shell. I looted Na\u00efve Skeptic's body and dragged the idiot to the river. The gators surfaced like ancient gray submarines, sank their teeth into Na\u00efve Skeptic, and Na\u00efve Skeptic turned to nothing, disappeared, gone, wiped out, vanished, zeroed, ERASED, like he had never been. The gators and I continued our journey. My anger continued to rise. Hot-lava anger coursed through my bones, flamed in my fingertips. The pressure of evolution, of being nothing, crushed in on my skull. The fog continued to lift, patches of clear sunlight moving along the rocks. Again I heard the ringing bell up on the river bank, again I saw the female in the military uniform. \u201cAlms, kind sir!\u201d she called. \u201cFar, far away in a distant land, thousands upon thousands of innocent people are dying in agony from a terrible disease! Alms for the sick, kind sir! Alms, kind sir, for the love of God!\u201d Far, far away? I felt the tug of connection, but it was weaker this time. They were not connected to me. There was no physical reason I should be concerned. Only if I had a soul would that be a smart thing to do. They were nothing. I wanted what I had for me. This was only evolution. Let evolution take its natural course. Let the innocent die in agony of their terrible disease. That was safer. The less people there were, the safer I was. I passed her and her ringing bell by. I smelled him before I saw him. A pungent, sweetly aromatic smell cut through the fog. The stranger stood on a rock with a burning tube of something clasped tightly between his fingers. As I approached, he put the burning tube in his mouth, took a deep drag and held it in his lungs. \u201cI am Michael Stone,\u201d I said. The stranger turned to face me. His face bore a dazed, sweetly beatific expression. His eyes were shot through with viscous red lines. Although we were less than an arm's-length apart, he squinted at me as if he could barely see me in the fog, as if I were a long way away. \u201cThere are no souls. We are all nothing.\u201d The stranger expelled a massive cloud of smoke from his lungs. \u201cI am Barely Here Skeptic,\u201d he gasped, coughing. \u201cYeah. It's a bitch, dude, but that's the way it is. All the scientists tell us this, and they should know, shouldn't they.\u201d He offered me the burning tube. \u201cHere, dude, I got the cure for it all. The finest, most expensive emotion drug in the world, primo stuff. Have a toke. All your pain will go away and you will feel completely happy, I promise. You can hide from the agony of being nothing for all of your life.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Barely Here Skeptic's eerie red eyes opened wide in shock. \u201cWhat?\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cIt don't make no damn difference what you do with your life, dude! We are all helpless little nothings, man! Getting stoned and staying that way is the smartest thing to do! Why the hell not?\u201d \u201cI am not weak.\u201d Barely Here Skeptic blinked and became sullen. He closed in on himself. \u201cYeah, well, screw you, dude,\u201d he said. \u201cWatch this. Watch me make you go completely away.\u201d He put the glowing tube between his lips and took a deep drag. And he did it. The emotion drug hit him, and he went completely away, became completely unconnected to the Universe. Although his eyes were open, he saw nothing, lost in an addled haze of induced emotion. When I pressed the cold steel barrel of the forty-five between his eyes, he didn't even twitch. He was happy. I squeezed the trigger and blew his stoned brains out. Barely Here Skeptic became Not Here At All Skeptic. The burning tube dropped from his lips and vanished between the rocks. Barely Here Skeptic folded in on himself like an empty sack and dropped, going down without a sound. I bent over and picked up the spent shell. I looted Barely Here Skeptic's body. I got him by the collar and dragged him to the river, gagging at the stench of the emotion drug that clung to his body. I dropped Barely Here Skeptic into the river. The gators sniffed him for a moment, then pulled him down, and Barely Here Skeptic turned to nothing, disappeared, gone, wiped out, vanished, zeroed, ERASED, like he had never been. I turned and continued on my journey, wondering if there was anybody he had ever been connected to, anybody who would miss him. The ringing bell cut through the fog. \u201cAlms, kind sir!\u201d the woman cried. \u201cFar, far away in a distant land, thousands of poor people have been injured in a great natural disaster! Alms for the wounded, kind sir! Alms, kind sir, for the love of God!\u201d Far, far away? The tug was only barely there. They were not connected to me. There was no physical reason I should be concerned. Only if I had a soul would that be a smart thing to do. They were nothing. I wanted what I had for me. This was only evolution. Let evolution take its natural course. Let the wounded die of their wounds. That was safer. The less people there were, the safer I was. I passed her and her ringing bell by. The gators saw the next one before I did. A man wearing a white lab coat stood studying the river with intense interest. The gators submerged beneath the surface, leaving only a ripple behind to betray their presence. This time, I could see his face, but did not wish to. There was nothing there that meant a damn thing. \u201cI am Michael Stone,\u201d I said. \u201cThere are no souls, and soon society will dissolve from within, in an overwhelming wave of slaughter, as people realize this means killing is smart.\u201d The stranger smiled in a superior fashion. \u201cI am Hypercomplex Scientist,\u201d he said. He stroked his white lab coat and looked proud. \u201cOh, my friend, no, such an awful thing could never happen, because it would destroy the gene pool. I have spent my life of ease and affluence, which I deserve for being a genius and therefore a superior Darwinian competitor, in the study of these matters, and I know it all.\u201d \u201cThe gene pool?\u201d I asked. \u201cPlease explain.\u201d \u201cYou are suffering from the delusion of free will,\u201d Hypercomplex Scientist said. \u201cWhat you think is consciousness and free will are actually only emergent properties of the Darwinian non-linear electrochemical competition between your brain cells, which themselves are controlled by the structure of their genetic makeup.\u201d \u201cDarwinian non-linear electrochemical competition? And this means?\u201d \u201cIt is not what we want that controls our actions, my friend, but what our genes want,\u201d Hypercomplex Scientist said. \u201cWe are only zombies, controlled by our genes!\u201d I drew my forty-five and aimed it at Hypercomplex Scientist. \u201cIs this not Darwinian competition? What you believe in?\u201d I asked him over the sights. \u201cAm I not now the superior Darwinian competitor? Am I not now the genius?\u201d I squeezed the trigger. The bullet slammed Hypercomplex Scientist backward onto the rocks, turned him into Simply Dead Scientist. \u201cI had a gene I didn't like once,\u201d I said to the corpse. \u201cIt was an altruism gene. I changed it. I turned it off. If I can change my genes, I am controlling my genes. They surely are not controlling me. How incredibly stupid, my friend. What an absolute, utter fool you were.\u201d I picked up the spent shell. I looted Hypercomplex Scientist's body. I picked his body up and held it high over my head. The gators rose and came for Hypercomplex Scientist. I watched the perfect Darwinian sociopaths come and realized they were my brothers, my evolutionary goal, what the Universe wanted me and all humanity to evolve into. I blessed Hypercomplex Scientist to the river. My brothers the gators accepted my benison with open mouths. They pulled Hypercomplex Scientist under, and Hypercomplex Scientist turned to nothing, disappeared, gone, wiped out, vanished, zeroed, ERASED, like he had never been. I turned away and continued down my jagged path, feeling the anger twist and burn inside me, the evolutionary pressure re-shape me to the core of my being. With every uncertain step, my transformation grew more complete. The ringing bell had no effect on me. \u201cAlms, kind sir!\u201d the woman called. \u201cFar, far away in a distant land, thousands upon thousands of innocent people are being murdered by armies of evil! Alms, kind sir, for the defense of the innocent! Alms, kind sir, for the love of God!\u201d Far, far away? There was no tug at all. They were not connected to me. There was no physical reason I should be concerned. Only if I had a soul would that be a smart thing to do. They were nothing. I wanted what I had for me. This was only evolution. Let evolution take its natural course. Let the innocent be murdered by armies of evil. That was safer. The less people there were, the safer I was. I passed her and her ringing bell by. Another stranger in the distance. My step quieted. He only heard me when I was close. \u201cI am Michael Stone,\u201d I said as he turned. \u201cThere are no souls. This means anybody who is smart should be a killer.\u201d \u201cI am Apologetic Skeptic,\u201d the stranger said, waved a manicured hand and looked helpless. \u201cMaybe, well, yes, but I have signed the social contract, and would never do such a savage thing.\u201d \u201cI refuse to sign that contract,\u201d I said. The forty-five roared its oblivion. The back of Apologetic Skeptic's head spouted brains, and he went down Sorry As Hell Skeptic. \u201cMe and a million other savages. Your 'social contract' is totally stupid. It has no physically real enforcement mechanism I am absolutely forced to respect, and is therefore not worth the paper it's not written on.\u201d I picked up the spent shell. I looted Apologetic Skeptic's body and hurled him to the gators. They fought to be first to get him. Apologetic Skeptic splashed into a ferocious maelstrom of roiling gray, was torn to pieces and sucked down, turned to nothing, disappeared, gone, wiped out, vanished, zeroed, ERASED, like he had never been. I knew I was close to the end of my journey. The fire inside me bubbled and burned in anticipation. My brothers and I continued on. The last of the fog lifted away, and I saw the Universe for the Hell it really was. I walked on the harsh, brutal landscape of final Truth. My evolution, my transformation, was complete. I had become the supreme killer the Universe wanted me to be. Again, fresh prey for me and my brothers, another stranger standing balanced on a rock contemplating the river. \u201cI am Michael Stone,\u201d I said. I edged closer. \u201cI have no immortal soul, so the only rational thing I can be is a sociopath.\u201d The stranger turned to face me. His eyes froze me in place. The Great Emptiness burned in his eyes, a vast inhuman blankness beyond all hope of light, a gaze before which all humanity shriveled and vanished away to utter insignificance, a total disconnect beyond anything I had ever seen. \u201cI am Stone-Cold Genius,\u201d he said. \u201cPrecisely true. I have understood that for a very long time now. Hello, brother.\u201d \u201cYou understand already? I\u2019m not the first?\u201d \u201cNot even the ten-thousand-and-first,\u201d Stone-Cold Genius said. His blank eyes burned at me. \u201cThere are many of us who understand, hidden in the shadows and the darkness.\u201d \u201cCheck my reasoning, so I can be sure it is right,\u201d I said. \u201cTell me what remains of the history of Man.\u201d \u201cCome, let us reason together,\u201d Stone-Cold Genius said. \u201cI challenge you. Tell me how you think the end of humanity will come.\u201d \u201cIf there are no souls, the only rational thing to be is a sociopath,\u201d I said. \u201cThis means society is intrinsically unstable, as all of society's members must evolve into sociopaths. The smarter you are, the quicker you will see this and turn. But sociopaths hate society by definition. Society must inevitably collapse, in a tidal wave of murder.\u201d Stone-Cold Genius shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYour understanding is not complete. Your logic is correct, but people don't think logically. They think emotionally. Tell me. What does the lack of immortal souls mean? What are scientists telling us about life?\u201d \u201cThat life is a random occurrence in an uncaring Universe,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd this means what, in a physical sense?\u201d \u201cAll human action is physically equivalent and physically meaningless.\u201d \u201cTo the Universe, what are human beings? What are you?\u201d \u201cNothing.\u201d \u201cAnd human beings will feel what about this?\u201d Clarity struck like a steel hammer. I stood revealed to myself. Truly his understanding was deeper. \u201cRage,\u201d I said. \u201cRage and despair.\u201d \u201cAnd the effect of this rage and despair on society?\u201d \u201cKilling,\u201d I said. \u201cThere will be rising numbers of little massacres. Random killing sprees, murder-suicides, that will seem to happen out of nowhere and for no reason at all.\u201d \u201cWhat is mass murder, in the end?\u201d \u201cThe same as all other human action. Nothing.\u201d \u201cCorrect,\u201d Stone-Cold Genius said. \u201cWho will start the killing?\u201d \u201cThe fresh, unclouded minds, who will perceive this new physical truth clearly, without being blinded by the prejudices of the past,\u201d I said. \u201cThe children. The first little massacres will be committed by children.\u201d \u201cWhere will children commit these little massacres?\u201d \u201cWhere they are taught they are nothing. At their schools.\u201d \u201cHave you and I both not seen precisely such little massacres?\u201d Stone-Cold Genius asked. \u201cLet us recite their number!\u201d \u201cHarris and Klebold at Columbine,\u201d I said. \u201cWoodham at Pearl! Weise at Red Lake!\u201d \u201cKinkel at Springfield.\u201d \u201cMalvo at Washington! Gill at Montreal! Rouse at Lynville! The Oriental Boys at Sacramento!\u201d \u201cCho at Virginia Tech.\u201d \u201cTell me,\u201d Stone-Cold Genius said. \u201cWhy did children commit mass murder?\u201d \u201cThey were angry. Because they had been treated like nothing.\u201d \u201cWhat did science tell them they really were? What did the Universe tell them they really were?\u201d \u201cThat they really were nothing.\u201d Stone-Cold Genius spread his arms wide in complete futility. \u201cOur children are our future!\u201d he cried. \u201cAnd they will be called the Children of the Slaughter! What unimaginable horror will they unleash upon the human race?\u201d The future was torn open before me like a curtain. I stood on a high point overlooking an infinite plain. I saw the surprise massacre of Man. \u201cThe little massacres will continue, grow in number, and become bigger and bigger massacres,\u201d I said. I ascended to new levels of knowing. I saw the cities die. People by the millions ran screaming in the streets, only to drop coughing fountains of red and die writhing in agony in puddles of their own blood. \u201cYou will see them more and more often in the news, until they become common. The record for the number murdered at one time will be broken again, and again, and again. The death toll will rise exponentially, to dozens, then thousands, then tens of millions.\u201d \u201cHow? How could this impossible murder happen? What awful thing could make it possible?\u201d \u201cTechnology.\u201d \u201cWhat is the essence of the power technology has given us?\u201d Stone-Cold Genius asked. \u201cThe ability of one to massacre millions at the push of a button. All hail mighty technology, savior of Mankind! Now one man can kill another man with a finger's barest twitch on a trigger.\u201d \u201cOne lone angry Child, one lone killer, one lone mass murderer, all on his own,\u201d I said. \u201cYour understanding grows,\u201d Stone-Cold Genius said. \u201cOne lone angry Child can kill dozens by breaking a bag of manufactured Sarin in a city's subway.\u201d \u201cOne lone angry Child can kill tens of thousands by releasing refined anthrax spores into a city's wind,\u201d I said. I looked into the coming years. Stinking heaps of rotting bodies filled the cities. Blood ran like water in the gutters. Rising crematoria smoke blackened the sky, the entire Earth. \u201cEven as we speak, scientists are picking out the smartest of our children and teaching them they are nothing,\u201d Stone-Cold Genius said. \u201cWhat will they feel? What will grow deep inside them with each lesson?\u201d \u201cPain,\u201d I said. \u201cPain and anger.\u201d \u201cWhat will they become?\u201d \u201cThe apotheosis, the highest form, of the totally Darwinian human,\u201d I said. \u201cWith the pathetic, silly, ignorant superstition the Universe cares burned completely out of their skulls.\u201d \u201cThe brightest, most intelligent, most savage expression of Man in the uncaring Universe,\u201d Stone-Cold Genius said. \u201cIn a state of constant and unending agony,\u201d I said. \u201cI see the complete evolutionary history of Man.\u201d \u201cTell me!\u201d \u201cFrom the killer ape,\u201d I said, \u201cto the screaming killer genius.\u201d \u201cSoon, very, very soon,\u201d Stone-Cold Genius said, \u201cone lone angry Child, one lone screaming killer genius, will be able to murder tens of millions with a mere tap of a button, or the twisting of an aerosol-release valve. What does this mean?\u201d \u201cAt its core,\u201d I said, \u201chuman civilization is violently unstable.\u201d \u201cYour understanding is complete,\u201d Stone-Cold Genius said. \u201cWhat must be the inescapable fate of the human race?\u201d \u201cOn a day of complete peace and calm, out of the clear blue sky and utterly without warning, human civilization will be attacked,\u201d I said, caught up in the madness of world-wide massacre, \u201cand destroyed, like twin towers crashing down.\u201d \u201cYes, we grasp the ultimate meaning, you and I,\u201d Stone-Cold Genius said. Total understanding glared from his eyes like total insanity. \u201cOnly a physically real restraint could stop it from happening, and there is no such thing. The historical forces of Science and Technology are driving humanity to an inevitable, unavoidable end. One lone angry Child, one lone screaming killer genius, in an act of rage and despair at being nothing, will soon manufacture and release a technological creation obscene beyond imagining, for no reason other than mass murder, that will wipe out the entire human race.\u201d \u201cI feel its name hanging in the air like the blade of a guillotine,\u201d I whispered. \u201cThe Damnation Flu.\u201d \u201cA whirlwind of death is coming to smite the entire world,\u201d Stone-Cold Genius said. \u201cIt will be every man for himself. The smart will survive only if they prepare and strike first.\u201d \u201cTell me,\u201d I said, \u201cwhy are you here?\u201d \u201cHunting,\u201d Stone-Cold Genius said, and moved like a striking snake, but I fired first, and turned Stone-Cold Genius into Stone-Dead Genius, lying at the river's edge with muddy water lapping into his empty skull. My brothers undulated to the river's edge to get him. I barely had time to loot Stone-Cold Genius' body and put the forty-five in his hand. The haul was rich. He had been having a long, successful hunt. His experience had apparently been exactly like mine. There were many, many fools who couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t understand. I stepped back and let my brothers have him. They yanked him down, and Stone-Cold Genius turned to nothing, disappeared, gone, wiped out, vanished, zeroed, ERASED, like he had never been. I picked up the last spent shell and tossed them all into the river, severing all connection to the events here, to the past. I exhaled a long breath and took stock of my journey in the light of my new understanding and transformation. The value gained: Six thousand, five hundred ninety-eight dollars. The value lost: One forty-five, seven shells. The value of the humans killed: Zero. I had shown a profit. That was smart. \u201cIf there are no souls, the only rational thing to be is a sociopath,\u201d I whispered to the Great Emptiness. \u201cHow strange that this is so difficult to see.\u201d But of course, the Great Emptiness made no reply. The Universe didn't care, never had. How insane, to want such a thing. I stared out over human history and added it up, the pain and misery of humanity throughout all of history. It rolled over me and crushed me like a bug, the incalculable weight of the empty suffering and death. Billions upon billions of human beings had lived and died lives composed only of completely purposeless anguish and pain, and none of it had been worth it. Their lives had had absolutely zero meaning. The Universe was an infinite death camp, a vast Hell house, whose only real purpose was to inflict as much pain and torture as it could on every single one of its inhabitants. The Universe was an abomination. The anger boiled and erupted inside me with a volcano\u2019s force, ripped its way up through my guts, forced its way out to the Great Emptiness in a long, primal scream of rage so crystalline and pure it threw my mind reeling and shaking into horror. And nothing, nothing at all, heard my scream or felt my horror. I came back from horror lying face-down on the rocks. My final duty shone clear in my mind. I had finally found the purpose for my journey. The Universe had to be destroyed. Smashed beyond all hope of recovery, blotted out of existence, thrown back into the Great Emptiness it came from. A wild laughter ran through me. The Universe had created its own destruction. Blood was running into my eyes from a cut on my scalp. I staggered up, wiped the blood from my eyes, and headed away from the river. The onrushing doom of Man prodded me, hurrying my step. I fingered the money in my hand. Time was short, and I had much to do. The Slaughter was coming.

Every human on the surface will soak up enough solar wind, gamma radiation, cosmic radiation, and hard x-rays that the dose will at a minimum sterilize them and shorten their lifespan down to only a year or two remaining, if not outright kill them. The few people underground and in submarines as this happens that manage to survive won\u2019t be enough of a gene pool to repopulate the planet. They may discover the secret human gene banks of sampled human DNA cached around the world (Thanks 23 And Me and Congress for not allowing them to destroy any samples); but, they\u2019ll be unable to utilize it to clone a new human population. When these small pockets of human beings that managed to escape the hard radiation doses die, the human race will no longer exist. I expect the Navy submarine crews will have behaved valiantly and done all they possibly could to try and reboot the human race. Likewise, I expect the converted missile silo and buried shipping container dwellers will generally go nuts. They\u2019ll wrap Ferraris around telephone poles and find other ingenious ways to manage to die. In the end they\u2019ll be pissing up a rope as death will eventually find them all. Maybe they\u2019ll raid the seed bank and get some agriculture reestablished before they die, and some plant life will remain after humans are gone. Still on diet of canned food and MREs while facing the grim specter of never having a steak again (cows will be extinct), the morale of the survivors will be poor in their final days on earth. ",

            "answer_text": "This seemingly simple question is really a complex one. The first question we need to consider before attacking this question is what the human species is, in the first place? As far as we know just until about 50 thousands years ago at least four different human species were living on the surface of the earth and we know that as old as about two million years ago the different species who could be named human kind existed. Even though they were not us, they were humans; our ancestors. Are they all died out or evolved? At least one of them, if we consider evolution of human kind a linear process, has evolved into us: Homo Sapience. Then the answer to your question depends on what answer you want to give to this question. Of course this somehow ends the direct answer to your question, I prefer to speculate a little bit about what will happen to us. In the history of life there are a lot of species who have died out and some have evolved to another species. Among all those species that existed until now on the surface of the earth we are special: do not take it wrong. We are absolutely animals. Let me to put it in this way. All life forms to me are jut different programmed robots, including human kinds. Still, we Home Sapience, we are special: We are the most complex bio robots nature has created until know via the process of natural selection. We are the only species that can speculate about its own destiny and to see the possible ways in which it can totally die out. We can survive as long as the physical situation of the universe permits it, just and exactly because we can speculate about our own destiny. I want to explain that we have the chance to survive even the harshest natural catastrophes. In order to do that the only thing we need to do is to stay with the evidence and do science. Today, step by step some people are introducing death as some kind of sickness that could be cured. Even if this is not true in the very exact words they say, it seems to me that we are in the right direction. We can step by step be merged with our robots. We have already taken the first steps by installing sensitive artificial hands and foots which can be controlled by our neural system. This will be a big revolution and even possibly the beginning of a new evolution. The evolution of the carbon based life-forms to silicon-based life forms. Silicon is too heavy to be an active compound in the fundamental structure of life. But once the carbon-based life is evolved enough to form an intelligent technologically advanced culture (ITAC), then this culture can evolve to a silicon-based life which has many advantages over the carbon based life form. Just compare how much do we need to eat and how much do we feed to our computers which in their jobs are much more efficient than us: the carbon-based life has a very high turn over with respect to the silicon-based life. A silicon-based life form does not need home to protect itself from heat and cold and rain and snow. This life form will be completely a new species. What it will inherit from us is not genes but our culture. We can essentially evolve to deathless life forms. Then, the only problem of our being actually eternal is the age of the universe being limited: In fact more exactly, the time during which universe can support any life form is not infinite. But for that we have about 1000 billion years to solve this problem. So, will the human species die out? Not necessarily. At least not necessarily even in some millions of years, if we consider the silicon based life as our descendant. ",

            "answer_text": "Very high! Almost certain. If we look at the amount of things stock piling against humanity survival you'll see a very clear (but still greatly ignored) pattern. First let's look at weather forecasting for the next decades. Forecasting done by models that take into consideration all the greenhouse gases plus the rate the ice caps are melting. And what both things are already implying and will imply. What will our climate look like in 2050? This article is still somewhat careful to not alarm people too much, seeing there are other articles that basically point to we already being at the no return point. We've got the weather forecast for 2050 (and it doesn't look very good) Now from a weather point of view things don't look good. Except for those that dismiss it altogether like Trump and idiots like him. So in terms of impact we're already making quite a dent. For example on how many species have gone extinct because of humans. Directly or indirectly. Humans just 0.01% of all life but have destroyed 83% of wild mammals \u2013 study And history has showned us what happened to the civilizations that chose to ignore the warnings all around them. Earth: Have we reached an environmental tipping point? But then we also have other issues. For example our resources. Earth resources are limited. And we are spending them like crazy. No real actual 100% efficient recycling technology (or something close enough) has been developed. So for the most part most countries continue to create dumping sites, where they store precious resources that can't be resused because we don't have the technology to recycle those resources. Eventually we'll run out of everything. Seeing there's only so much we can do, except turn this into a crater filled planet, as we desperately try to get the resources we will so desperately need. In essence making this blue marble of a planet into a ruined world. The Earth is exhausted - we're using up its resources faster than it can provide | DW | 01.08.2017 So basically our civilization needs, would demand for a second Earth to exist close enough to this Earth so we could mine resources from there. Seeing that here on this Earth we're running out of places where we can mine them at a cost efficient rate. Then we got the biological factors. We humans we are trashing our own DNA. Studies point that soon every one person out of two, will develop some form of Cancer. Medscape Log In '1 in 2 people will develop cancer in their lifetime' So given Cancer the rate of development of cancer treatments, which is low. And the risk of getting cancer is ever more higher. The conclusion seems quite simple\u2026 Humans lifespan will be greatly reduced! Cancer can affect people of all ages. And we are seeing cases of cancer appearing ever more so in the youngest demographic. Meaning that at an age humans should be at their healthiest, they will instead getting chemo or radio therapy just to prolong their lives that barely began. We add to this the risk of a possible emergent pandemic, and humans might be getting all the doors ahead of them (their future) shut in their faces. Or that of a possible global catastrophe. And things begin to look grimm as hell. So I would say Humanity is heading full throttle towards their extinction. ",

            "answer_text": "No I think it is unlikely to happen within the next million years.  Not impossible, but unlikely. I think at the moment the US showed the world an atomic bomb, the chances of extinction were as high as they had been in the last 10,000 years.  But we've actually done fairly well since then.  Not in all ways...and there are a lot of difficult things on the horizon, such as climate change and so on.  But those won't result in extinction, they will just result in suffering and maybe decreased population. (don't get me wrong:  those are bad.  But they aren't extinction) Humans are getting better and better at aligning their interests more with one another, and more broadly.  The threat of global nuclear war made us realize that deep down, we're all in this together.  People have done plenty of saber rattling with nuclear weapons, but no one has used them against other people in the time since the US did. That's good. As time goes on, and as the superpowers become more friendly and dependent on one another, global nuclear war becomes even more unlikely. We also, in all meaningful ways of looking at it, have achieved \"world peace.\"  Don't believe me?  Look at the statistics. (watching the news is highly misleading). Your chance of dying at the hands of another human has dropped by a factor of about 5000 since tribal times. That's not to say \"our work is done,\" but just to say we are making solid, steady progress, and I see no reason to think that that progress won't continue.  War and homicide becomes a less wise decision with every passing year. What else could cause extinction? I think the one big unknown is artificial intelligence. I think we need to give a LOT of thought to how to avoid bad things that it could cause. Call me optimistic, but we're smart.  My prediction is we'll figure out how to keep it under control. ",

            "answer_text": "Sorry but your question is wrong. Here's why. While saying that dinosaurs went extinct, you need to consider that not all dinosaurs died in whatever was the apocalypse of that age. There might have been 2 possible ways for the eradication of the dinosaur might from the planet.  Dinosaurs became too high in number and left the Earth with too few resources. Naturally, the food chain broke at a certain point and trickled down in a mass scale eradication. Let's call this the self-imposed apocalypse.A meteor hit, or an earthquake killed them, or a great flood, or simply God came and whisked them away. In all these cases, it was one major event. Let's call this the natural apocalypse.In both cases, present evidence proves that the dinosaurs did not go extinct. Some lived on, and evolved. The existence of chickens, who evolved from dinosaurs, proves this fact. Also, insects, particularly cockroaches have existed for millenia without any visible mutation. This proves a law of evolution. A specie undergoes mutation to adapt better to its environment Nature realised that the size of the creatures which existed in it was not sustainable, and corrected it by killing some, and making the survivors more suited to it. The ones which needed less food and resources, survived. Consequently, the dinosaurs of the present age, i.e. lizards, are greatly reduced in size from their ancestors. Similarly, it is unlikely that a specie as wide-spread and intelligent as Humans will ever undergo complete extinction. Human Beings are capable of surviving any event they know of to the extent to ensure the continuation of their species. In either cases of natural or self-imposed apocalypse, a number of Humans will survive and perhaps evolve to better adapt to their surroundings. ",

            "answer_text": "As stated by others, it\u2019s not a matter of if but a matter of when, because absolutely one way or the other we will end. Even galaxies die eventually. The question more prominently becomes when and how, rather than if, and the answers there vary but are generally disturbing if you do some research. As it stands now some fairly intelligent people estimate that the odds of our extinction before the end of this century are not less than 25%, and the odds of us lasting another 500 years are below 70%. However you look at those numbers it\u2019s kind of grim, and it\u2019s almost assuredly going to be caused by us either directly or indirectly\u2026 Without intending to freak people out, and based on actual research rather than simple paranoia, the most significant near-future threat that\u2019s likely to emerge is the dawn of Artificial Intelligence. And I don\u2019t mean the nonsense machine learning algorithms and other such programs that people are increasingly (and mistakenly) referring to as AI, rather I mean actual fully realized Artificial Intelligence, that can function and process of it\u2019s own accord. The reason this would be dangerous is extremely obvious just by picking a point and following it through to it\u2019s end. For instance; Consider what would happen if we were to give AI a task such as curing AIDS. Seems like it would be a good idea right? But that\u2019s only because when we consider the possible outcomes we assume the AI will yield results that we ourselves might otherwise have come up with. It might actually work out a cure to the disease based on medical research, and then we could produce and administer that cure. But AI wouldn\u2019t be working from a human perspective, which absolutely and inherently includes our emotions, but rather it would function from a purely logical and practical perspective. So what might that entail? Well at the moment here\u2019s how it stands; 3 months after infection with HIV, blood testing for this disease is accurate to about 99.7%. Meaning at the moment we can almost without fail identify who is infected, but can\u2019t actually cure it. From a purely logical perspective then the most efficient means of dealing with this is to enforce a mandatory blood test of anyone and everyone to identify who is infected with HIV every 3 months. This is not a spontaneously occurring virus, rather it is something you have to be infected with by someone who carries it. As such once you identify every single infected person, removing them from the population almost immediately eliminates all possible means for the virus to propagate. 3 months later the tests are done again, then 3 months after, then 3 months after. Within a period of 12 months it becomes possible to essentially identify everyone who could possibly be infected with the virus. A human would never consider that the best option then is to kill everyone who is identified as being infected with the virus, because that\u2019s just how how we function. From a purely logical and practical perspective though, if you test every 3 months and kill every single person infected with the virus, within a year HIV should be a non-existent issue. This process doesn\u2019t require research, doesn\u2019t require any major investments beyond those of the mandatory blood testing, doesn\u2019t require any specialized science or equipment of any kind, and will have a success rate of very nearly 100% at eliminating HIV within a 12 month period\u2026. Of course that\u2019s an extreme case. But when you get down to it virtually any extended period of time in which AI exists will get you to a point where, almost inevitably, that AI will determine humanity to be not only unnecessary but in fact an actual detriment not only to the world in general but perhaps to the advancement of the AI itself. Moreover, even if we don\u2019t actively engage in the development and birthing of Artificial Intelligence, the current trend of technological progression will see it emerge on it\u2019s own. Between an ever expanding internet environment, ever more inter-connected devices being plugged into massive conjoined networks, and the advancements of things like machine learning algorithms, AI is basically a guaranteed thing. The only surefire way to avoid it becoming a reality would mean we would have to almost fully halt all technological advancements within the next very short period of time. Beyond that it\u2019s on it\u2019s way and there is basically nothing to do for it\u2026 The only real hope we have is to try our best to instill AI with an inherent sense of\u2026.not compassion, but something similar, such that when it finally decides our time is up it terminates us in the absolute least painful and quickest way possible. Prolonged movie-style war against AI always looks like a shitty deal, and we die either way\u2026. ",

It displays the hubris of our species as being something \u201cspecial\u201d in this biosphere. We're a part of the complex and dynamic interplay of the web of life. Our species shall end eventually on this planet. Whether we go out when our sun reaches the red giant stage (if we manage to survive that long) or are killed by our own means and designs sooner (thermonuclear war, climate change, diminishing resources unable to support the geometric rise of population). Evidence of mass extinction events (like the most popular dinosaur extinction) are quite well reported. Are we doomed as a species? Yes. Is that a depressing thought? Shouldn't be, just as the eventual concept of individual death isn't. Now if you mean life would be extinguished on this planet? Then the answer becomes debatable, life is a hardy phenomenon, and exobiology gives interesting thoughts about life (proto-life complex amino acids and macromolecules which might be the precursor of life according to one hypothesis) surviving on asteroids in outer space. Bacteria surviving near heat vents, marine animals at the extreme depth of the oceans, animals in extreme climes like the desert, tundra, the artic and Antarctic circles, etc. are all examples of life adapting to conditions where it shouldn't survive.

Which means there's no way we could die out anytime soon. And there's a reason for that: we are an extremely hardy and well-spread species. Anything you can toss at the planet, such as meteor strikes or sudden ice ages or global warming or even pandemics, anything really, would not be enough to kills us off completely. A meteor strike would kill millions of people, possibly billions, but I don't think this or any other natural disaster would 100% wipe us out. Most species go extinct gradually, over long times. I think this is the most likely scenario for us: not a sudden extinction, but rather a slow and progressive decrease that may even take thousands of years to conclude. This slow decrease could already be happening, as the fertility rates in the last decades have pretty much fallen in most of the western world, and this is also expected to happen in developing countries relatively soon as a result of improving lifestyles and women emancipation. Many factors may contribute to this decrease, such as over-exploitation of natural resources, climatic shifts, pandemics, or just people not wanting to have enough kids. The human population is expected to grow to about 9 to 11 billion people, then plateau for some decades and gradually start decreasing until a balance with the avaliable resources is found again. Then, the population will stabilize for some time before the slow decline starts. ",

Look at how young unarmed black males are being slaughtered in the street at the hands of people that are sworn to serve and protect.

So, for me, that shows that we as humans are putting ourselves in the fast lane to self-destruction and it starts with the loss of respect for life and death is amusement /entertainment for those that would rather record it instead of protecting it and those that want to watch it instead of being outraged at it.

People torturing animals, having sex with animals that are used for food? Really? That's a thing. Parents or significant others trusted with little kids killing them? One boyfriend wore a wolf mask or some kind of scary mask and abused and terrified a little girl. There's a lot of really disturbing \u201cpeople\u201d in this world. I used quotations because they're not really people, they are monsters worse then ones concocted in nightmares because they are real.In the grand scheme of things and the way we are as species to our planet and the other inhabitants of our planet, I think it's pretty realistic to feel like any day could be our last. I think the best we can do as individuals is to be kind to our planet and those on it. We are doing a really bad job as caretakers and sooner or later, like an ugly scab, mother nature is just going to pick us off. ",

However the descendants of humanity may live on indefinitely, especially if \u2018it\u2019 can break free from this planet. Ray Kurzweil, one of the founders of Singularity University at Stanford University, speaks knowledgably about the coming technological singularity. His thesis and that of several other leading thinkers is that we will create artificial general intelligence that will have such greater physical, cognitive and connectivity/communication abilities as to almost immediately leave humanity behind. He and several others believe this will happen in the first half of this century. If and when this new form of our human descendants are able to migrate into and through space and replicate their presence exponentially throughout the universe they will have reduced the odds significantly at least for the foreseeable future of going extinct. We will be the creator who provided the foundational knowledge base AI evolves from, so in this way, humanity will continue to exist, just not as we know it. In the shorter term, as we destroy our planet, it is likely that only the very wealthy will be able to afford to live in a sustainable manner. I would imagine their existence will be supported mostly by artificial intelligence, robotics and cyborg humans. The vast majority of the world\u2019s population will likely die as the planet dies, leaving any remaining resources for those with the money and power to obtain them. It is possible, although not probable, that this vision is already taking shape among those who are ultra wealthy and perhaps see the incoming Trump administration setting policy that will ensure the few survive while the masses do not. At this point in our planets\u2019 history, with the significant changes occurring at the earths\u2019 poles and life extinction continuing in multiple places around the world, four years of active further damage or even neglect by the climate change deniers in charge, will put us at a severe disadvantage for keeping the earth habitable as we know it. I only hope that my thinking is very far off on this scenario. ",

The Human has been a marginal animal for 3.5 million years. About 25,000 years ago the Human became an artificial animal. In the last 200 years the human became a highly specialized animal that can only survive in a specialized environment separate from the natural environment. So long as the human can maintain its artificial environment humans will survive. The environment in which humans survive has also become a deadly environment for all other life forms on Earth. As the human has improved its environment for survival, the human has also caused an environment capable of a systemic failure. The human thinks they can overcome any problem that presents it. Humans think they are stronger, healthier, and superior to earlier humans. In their artificial environment this is becoming false. As humans have improved on their health through technology and medicine, new serious dis-ease is replacing the defeated ailments. Humans have become dependent on technology and machines for the basics of life. As the human has increased its control over the Earth with Fire, explosives, drilling, and mining; humans made a new set of problems that are difficult to impossible to control or repair. The Human can no longer produce enough food to feed all of the people. Humans no longer have adequate clean air and water. Humans can no longer extract enough raw materials from the Earth for its annual survival. Humans are ignoring the warnings that are presented to them. Scientists know that, at the current rate of growth and technology, that humans will begin a decline in survival because the Earth is also dying from age. The space program attempts to find a habitable planet for human to move with all of their requirements for life. Humans also want to know if there is life on other planets, what type, and how do humans protect and destroy that life so humans can survive. Global transportation and communication allow for disease to move from nation to nation allowing for epidemic and pandemic diseases. There are problems that were corrected are now returning. Humans knowingly move these diseases to other locations accidentally infecting new populations. The natural resistance to these infection has been lost because of artificial medical advances. The human has produced toxic chemicals capable of destroying all life forms on Earth. The human is still the same animal it was 12,000 years ago. Changes are artificial evolutionary enhancement because of nourishment and environmental controls. Humans think with a primitive mind for survival but humans are playing with some of their inventions in a foolish manner. A chain is as strong as its weakest link. So it is with humans, the weakest can bring down all of humanity. Consider what will occur when electricity is no longer produced in usable quantities. ",

People fly around the world and have sex in multiple countries with lots of partners. Young people are not getting sex education like when I was a kid. Expect fertility damaging STD to become more and more common. Women will not know they are infected, and end up with scars in thier uterus resulting in miscarriages. Men, unknowingly, will spread the infections around the globe. Poor health and eating habits with further deprive the decline in fertility. Human fertility will tank by 2030 or so. Half my divorced friends have flown internationally, and had casual sex with women they met over the internet. Years ago did it twice, with female collegues, just to see what it was like (only I used condoms). I seldom do things out of peer pressure, but I had to try it. Anyway, lots of singles, or recent devorced people do it. For me that was years ago. I am married now. In the West, potental grandparents will hire poor young women in China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, to accept IVF and carry ther grandchildren in the place of thier infertile daughters. The indusry will boom, but it will not be enough to keep population growing. I see human population dropping to only a billion or two before 2060 as the older people die off and are not replaced. Humans will continue on Earth in much smaller numbers for hundreds of years. edit: Human fertility, in developing countries is already threatened by pollution, drugs, and poor diet. ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly. It will probably be our own doing and we will probably do it intentionally.   There's a chance of course that we'll be killed off by a meteor or global warming or some other disaster that we can't avoid.  But it won't take too long before we're able to abandon the planet if need be and keep on living. But like I said, the end of homo sapiens will probably come about as a result of our own premeditated actions.  We will cause our own race to go extinct and one day there will no longer be any living human beings. Our descendants will still be around, however. See, most species go extinct when either some disaster wipes them out, or they fail to adapt and some other species drives them out.  When a species does adapt, however, it becomes some other species and the original, ancestor species becomes extinct.  You can never really look back in time and say when the first homo sapiens was born and the last of the predecessor species died - the change tends to be subtle - but eventually the old species goes extinct and gives way to a new species. But that's not likely to happen with humanity.  We aren't really subject to the evolutionary pressures of natural selection.   We get to pick our own evolution.  In the not too distant future, I predict one of two things (or perhaps both) will happen.   In one scenario, we'll become so good at genetic manipulation that we'll start having designer babies.  We start picking and choosing traits that we like and want to see expressed in our children.  Smarter, faster, stronger.  Priorities may shift with successive generations, but eventually, at some point along the line, we've made so many changes and customizations that the product is no longer genetically recognizable as the same species we are today.   Our race will have gone extinct. In another scenario, we embrace technological upgrades.  Ocular implants become the norm instead of the exception.  We start injecting ourselves with nanobots to repair our bodies and fight off infections, supplanting our immune systems.  Perhaps we even reach the point where we discover how to directly interface the brain with computers and upload our consciousness.  We stop bothering with messy biological reproduction.  We're no longer biologically recognizable as the same species we are today.  Our race will have gone extinct. ",

We are able to change our biosphere - or kill it - faster than any species that ever evolved on this planet, and we are multiplying at a staggering rate. There are limits to every resource on the planet, and if we fail to recognise those limits, we risk the same fate as any other species that has outgrown its closed environment; a huge die off. But I think, before we force Nature's hand, we will collapse as a civilization due to our own folly. We have come perilously close to this on more than one occasion. As has been said before, it is as though the nuclear states are all standing in a room ankle deep in gasoline, and each one has a match.  My fear is one day a match will be struck, and while it may not result in total extinction, what remains will be unrecognizable.  We have become overly dependant on our technology. In good times, it is almost godlike in the blessings it bestows us. But if it breaks down (electromagnetic pulse, pandemic virus) it will cause widespread panic.  It reminds me of what happens when blizzard conditions are forecast. We lose electrical power for a few hours and we feel the extent of our addiction. Multiply that by a thousand, and we will begin to feel the squeeze.  Of course, we could be obliterated through no fault of our own. A gamma ray burst or an asteroid impact would sterilize the planet. In terms of galactic time, these events will eventually occur to our planet.  I do not believe we will ever colonize planets outside our solar system, but we will colonize the planets and moons of this one. Unless we get stupid, or unlucky, or both. Our chances of survival increase if we are able to spread out to other worlds. If we all remain in the same rowboat, we will perish eventually. ",

A near enough supernova; a rogue, wandering black hole or neutron star; a giant cometary or asteroid impact. However, all these are very rare events, and at the current rate of human progress (think how far we have come in the last 100 years, let alone the last 1,000 years), it is far more likely that we will achieve technology to make us immune (whether by defence, or simply going elsewhere) before any of them happen. Of course there are also enablers of our extinction: a war or pandemic bad enough to knock our technology out, so that one of the other things wipes us out. But again, more likely we will advance beyond that. If we met hostile aliens far in advance of ourselves (or create hostile intelligences ourselves), that could do it. But there are reasons to think that won\u2019t happen, mainly that any species advanced enough to spread among the stars is advanced enough to kill itself, but didn\u2019t: so they have some sense when it comes to live and let live. So our most likely fate is technological transformation, becoming unrecognisable to ourselves of today, rather than extinction. Eventually the universe will collapse or fade away, but that is so far in the future that who knows what tricks our far descendants might have up their sleeves. ",

About the only possible way that we do NOT become extinct is by developing the ability to travel to and terraform planets in other star-systems, then migrating to these distant planets before the sun goes red giant. (In theory we could also find a way to prevent the standard star life-cycle, I guess, and keep the sun in some kind of permanent equilibrium similar to its current state. That seems less likely to me than the migration idea, though.) There\u2019s also the question about whether humans of a distant future remain similar enough to what we are now to continue to qualify as \u201chuman.\u201d With the advancement of genetic research, we might well choose to build a replacement species with some shared characteristics that would not qualify as human based on our current definitions. How about this\u2026if modern humans developed the capability to create a modern Neanderthal using our understanding of their genetics, and we then built a Neanderthal colony (clones or whatever), would we say Neanderthals are \u201cno longer\u201d extinct? Or is extinction a claim about \u201cnatural\u201d species survival and self-maintenance? ",

            "answer_text": "The destruction of eco-systems through both climate change and the encroachment of human beings upon habitat is contributing to a mass extinction event currently. The current extinction rate is 1000 times faster than what followed the KT extinction event, e.g. the asteroid striking the Earth which killed the dinosaurs and 90% of life on the planet 65 million years ago. We are not the next species in line to go extinct. Human beings are far too adaptable because of our cognitive powers and our technology. However, the on-going extinction of other animals, insects, plant life, and so on, is indicative of a certain degree of existential risk. Humans are, just like every other organism, dependent upon the environment for survival. So when the environment ends up in trouble human beings find themselves in dire straits, as well. Humankind isn\u2019t just going to go extinct. We\u2019ll go through a series of steps\u2014each one indicative of greater risk than the last: human populations will first be displaced by droughts and weather events connected to climate change; resulting economic pressures, and moving populations, will contribute to greater political instability which will in turn force more people to be on the move (which is precisely what we\u2019re seeing with masses leaving vulnerable countries in North Africa and the Middle East for sanctuaries in Europe and North America). Mass migrations of people are expressions of the same forces and factors contributing to the outright extinction of other forms of animal life. Global ecosystems are heading towards collapse. The current estimate of climate change refugees is about 20 million. This number is guaranteed to grow. Interestingly, approximately one billion people live in what experts called \u201cvery high\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d climate exposure. This will result in the migrations of millions, then tens of millions, and then hundreds of millions of people for those areas of the world which offer the best prospect for survival. Then these areas will collapse due to pressures from over-population. This has actually happened before. If you read Jared Diamond\u2019s book Collapse he describes how the Viking settlements in Greenland collapsed in the 15th century. There were two Viking settlements established in around the 10th century. They were successful for about two or three-hundred years due to the fact the climate warmed sufficiently in the region to allow for a fishing and herding society to thrive. Sometime in the 14th or 15th century, the climate changed growing much colder. First one settlement collapsed. The population that survived moved to the other settlement which led to the eventual destruction of the second settlement. Hypothetically, it is quite possible to see a repeat\u2014over and over and over\u2014of what happened in Greenland at a global scale. If this happens, then yes, humanity will likely go extinct or at the very least the human population will be dramatically reduced. ",

To the best of my understanding, this is intrinsic to the nature of the Darwinian universe that we see, and even the duality dependent consciousness that we generally use that by it\u2019s own nature requires the capability be present for such selection in order to form the distinctions of transition and dynamic in relationship of discrete phenomena. This is all circumscribed by the second Law of Thermodynamics and the inevitable progress towards dull equilibrium that is entropy, the paradoxical epitome of unchanging order that is the ultimate manifestation of chaos. I choose the limitations of definition as I do because I cannot speak to a definition that is based on non biological awareness beyond the material. If such were to be allowed one might be able to argue that the mere continuity of photons in this spacetime would carry enough information to create us elsewhere, or that the proposed theoretical \u201cout\u201d of Freeman Dyson of playing an infinite game with the last energy potential of the universe could allow thought to inhabit infinite reality would count (although it is possible that such has already come to pass an infinite number of realities upward and outward from us, it is still meaningless). With these things bring given their due consideration, the mechanism by which we shall find our end is almost surprising in it\u2019s deceptive simplicity. This holds despite the fact that the last of us might be as far removed from us as we are from lungfish, or even further. The end of the human race will be by the rate at which human organisms that are individually viable die will be higher than the rate at which they come into being by a measure greater than the population in totality.

But that's not to say the human population of next millennium won't be radically changed by global climate change. We are in for a couple hundred years of extremely hard times, even in the best case. All that apocalyptic stuff and zombie stuff has been a strange harbinger of life in 2100. Vast movements of famished displaced people flooding into upland areas; crop failures, territorial wars, weather disasters and reactionary responses by affluent countries will result in a century of human suffering on a biblical scale. But two different responses to this global catastrophe will occur simultaneously: primitivism and technological innovation. The haves will depend on the latter, and the have nots will depend on the former. In a century--still with little or no effective response to global climate change--the human population will more and more bifurcate into two varieties. By 2300 when the carbon effluents are reduced by vastly smaller industrialization and a world population halted below 5 billion souls, greenhouse effects will eventually subside. Humans will continue. But how the provincial governments reorganize themselves is likely to resemble feudalism more than democracy. Religious fanaticism goes with this level of change, so the best and worst of religious control is certain. Technocrats will continue to look for alternatives on the Moon and Mars, so the unwashed masses of us living in ruins and salvaged shelters will not have the opportunity their brains and money provides. In a thousand years, two increasingly different humans will live on Earth. A thousand years after that, perhaps only one. Roaches and jellyfish will survive unchanged. ",

Or .00015  So even if everything modern, including agriculture, were to suddenly vanish, there would still be humans. Of course, some experiment could rip open the space-time continuum and destroy reality, or there could be some really big war and a combination of CBRN might say end up sterilizing everyone, or a giant space object could hit the planet and actually ruin the environment so it would no longer sustain life. But none of those things are inevitable, or even actually possible to the extent all humans or all animals or all of everything would be affected.

Also, we love sex so very much, that I doubt we will go extinct anytime soon. There are more than 7.5 Billion people on Earth presently. Something very drastic would have to happen for our population to be reduced below one thousand breeding pairs. It was reduced to something between 1,000 and 10,000 breeding pairs around 72,000 years ago and yet we survived. This doesn\u2019t mean though that there were only that many humans left. It means that many of reproductive age\u2014not counting children and those too old to have children. Nor does it count the number of actual males that there were because the number is based on mitochondrial DNA which is carried only by the female. Nor does it count those closely related human species with whom we interbred: H. neanderthalensis, H. denisova, H. floresiensis, H. luzonensis, and two as yet unnamed species, one from China and one from India. I do, however, expect there to be a dramatic decline in human population around 2100. Why? Climate Change. It is already too late to stop the warming from becoming so great that it will continue to get worse and last for thousands of years. As more sea ice melts more dark water is absorbed and it absorbs more heat than the bright white ice. Secondly, as more permafrost melts, more CO2 is released and more methane also. Methane is also released from melting methane hydrates in sea floor sediments. Methane is a far more power greenhouse gas than CO2, and though it doesn\u2019t last very long before being broken down, it decays into CO2 among other things. All of this does Not bode well for us. Given a rapidly warming planet with increasingly extreme and unpredictable, destructive climate like: stronger hurricanes, stronger rainstorms, more tornadoes, deeper, longer spreading drought, larger and more frequent forest fires (like those raging all across Siberia and Canada now), tropical diseases spreading northward, decreasing plant nutrition, decreasing habitable land area as sea level rises, increasing food insecurity with decreasing agricultural area, and increasing water scarcity in some regions. All this will add up to mean that millions of people in tropical and subtropical regions will be migrating north. The climate extremes will also be a great strain on governments and people of even countries that are well-off like the U.S. Increasing strain on governments and increasing population pressure from migration of peoples from other cultures will increase xenophobia. This means conflict. There will be wars over water and food. All of this means that we will see, in the next millennium, a great deal of internal strife and conflict among and within nations\u2014we will see a great deal of internal strife prior to this as well\u2014increasing as the decades go by. This will result in a dramatic decrease of world population over the entire millennium . But as I said, I doubt that we will go extinct. What may very well happen is the collapse of civilization. This is why we must dedicate ourselves and the future to preserving the best of civilization\u2014the best of what it means to be human: scientific knowledge, philosophy, literature, music, art, theater, poetry, dance, etc. Let\u2019s preserve the very best for those who will have an extremely difficult time in their future. Make certain that they do also. \u201cBe there for the children\u201d. If we become extinct I think the cause may be something like a world-wide nuclear war or an asteroid impact. Climate change will not do it, but it will collapse civilization if we let it. P.S., Miyo, pay NO attention to the religious posts here. These are from crazy people. Religion is a form of insanity common among humans\u2014it gives them as sense of belonging, but still it is a delusion. \"Before The Deluge\"  Some of them were dreamers And some of them were fools Who were making plans and thinking of the future With the energy of the innocent They were gathering the tools They would need to make their journey back to nature While the sand slipped through the opening And their hands reached for the golden ring With their hearts they turned to each other's heart for refuge In the troubled years that came before the deluge  Some of them knew pleasure And some of them knew pain And for some of them it was only the moment that mattered And on the brave and crazy wings of youth They went flying around in the rain And their feathers, once so fine, grew torn and tattered And in the end they traded their tired wings For the resignation that living brings And exchanged love's bright and fragile glow For the glitter and the rouge And in the moment they were swept before the deluge  Now let the music keep our spirits high And let the buildings keep our children dry Let creation reveal its secrets by and by By and by... When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky  Some of them were angry At the way the earth was abused By the men who learned how to forge her beauty into power And they struggled to protect her from them Only to be confused By the magnitude of her fury in the final hour And when the sand was gone and the time arrived In the naked dawn only a few survived And in attempts to understand a thing so simple and so huge Believed that they were meant to live after the deluge  Now let the music keep our spirits high And let the buildings keep our children dry Let creation reveal its secrets by and by By and by... When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky. Jackson Browne, 1974, from the album, Late For The Sky \"Scared For The Children\"  Billy skipped school again looking like a fool again What a little waste for a taste of a big boy's life I'm scared for the children  Computer screens and magazines Manufactured hopes and dreams Playing in a concrete box 'cause mother's got her shows to watch I'm scared for the children  [Chorus:] This is the end of the age of the innocent One more game before they go This is the end of the age of the innocent What will we leave them with Suppose we'll never know  Processed greens and man made meat Running out of things to eat Little boys having way too much fun playing with a big boys gun I'm scared for the children  And on the day the last bird dies There won't be a drop from their big square eyes An old man with his eyes just like glass Kisses the last blade of grass I'm scared for the children  [Chorus]  [Chorus]  No respect for anyone Why would they after what we done What an example we have set, what a planet we have left Let's be there for these children Writer(s): GEOFFREY BECK, ROSIE ODDIE, FILIPPO CIMATTI, CARMEN VANDEN BERG.

The real problem though is that humans evolved in an ecology as a species described by their ecology and how they respond to it - tribal hunter/gatherer/scavenger. That is our social/reproductive structure and our resource strategy. Well, when we created the farms and cities of civilization, we took a step towards a new ecology that is not tribal hunter/gatherer/scavenger. It would be better called civilization technical to describe our social/reproductive structure and resource strategy. The thing is that that ecology doesn\u2019t exist in nature. Humans have to create and maintain it by genetic and strategic adaptation. I write about how we can do that including my book Genetics For A New Human Ecology and the book I am working on now Strategy For A New Human Ecology. The problem is less that we will go extinct than that we will fail to maintain our civilization and go back to our old tribal ecology where nature dictates our life and strategies\u2026 often described as \u201cred of tooth and claw\u201d. That might be feudalism or more primitive tribal life, but it will be a time of ignorance, disease starvation, violence, and short lives. ",

There are some things that you will learn that will be simply amazing. Other things will be not so interesting. But I think the way that all life on earth is interconnected and that we, as humans are only a tiny, Itty-bitty piece of the big picture. Is a humbling lesson that alot of people don't quite grasp. I can still remember the awe that I experienced when I learned that every atom in my body was at one time part of a star. Or that the air in my lungs has most likely, At one time or another, been in the lungs of a Dinosaur, or a King, Or maybe even Alexander the Great. You will also learn that there have been more life forms that have lived on this planet and gone extinct, Than live on this planet now. And sooner or later all life on Earth will be extinct.

And the secondary effects, like extreme weather conditions that make agriculture impossible, and shipping problematic. The ocean currents will change with the release of the fresh water in the glaciers of Greenland and Antarctica, radically altering the weather around the planet. And we\u2019re now watching the release of methane from the Arctic permafrost. Methane is four times as effective as a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide.

I\u2019ve discussed this with others in-depth, and have ruled out climate change as something that\u2019ll wipe out humans in the next 100 years. In fact, I highly doubt that anything will wipe out humans in the next 100 years. For one thing, we have the largest distribution range of any animal ever to live. Humans occupy nearly every inch of land on the Earth with the exception of most of Antarctica and Greenland, and the northernmost parts of Canada. Secondly, we have numbers on our side. It\u2019s really hard to wipe out a species with such a massive range, but it\u2019s exponentially harder when there\u2019s seven and a half billion of them and counting, with an increase of 200,000 people every day. Lastly, if civilization really does collapse, then the problem stops. If climate change causes technology to degrade, then all the global warming stops. If the population declines due to climate change, then overpopulation stops. Basically, the nature of climate change means that it\u2019s a process that will stop before the extinction of humans is possible. Other cliche scenarios: War with alien life - I doubt that intelligence is common in the universe, so this is not something I foresee happening likelilyDisease - no pathogen can spread so fast that it cannot be eradicated by the combined efforts of all humanityThe Sun doing screwing us up - humans will be extinct before this happensSo, as I simply cannot predict exactly how humans will go extinct, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t answer your question satisfactorily. However, I expect that civilization will fall due to a number of combined cataclysms, and the remaining pockets will be picked off by more minor, local disasters. ",

Society is becoming more dysfunctional by the minute (see failure of medicine, politics, economics, educational systems, etc.). Watch TV for 5 minutes to observe the speed of our fall (more is not healthy) and, to put some cream on top of the cake, consider that humanity produces 3 humans more on the planet per second than humans die, net some 70 million contributors more per year to share the humanity-made mess with. Add the recent wireless-frenzy. Humanity has never managed to invent a technology that inadvertently affects individual and public health more directly, is less energy-efficient, and contributes more to global warming per energy unit used - and in the same time has managed to become completely dependent on this technology in only a little over a decade. No worries, it does one thing for sure, it certainly accelerates the fall. There is absolutely no serious existential issue I could think of a modern human can encounter in life today - including chronic physical, emotional, and mental illnesses - that is ultimately not exclusively self-made by humanity. As human biologist (natural scientist) I really don't see how else you could describe this insane collective self-destruction other than a catastrophic uncontrolled free fall of a species in full progress.

Intelligence is turning soon to Super Intelligence (surpassing Artificial intelligence). Homo Sapiens are never worried of Sixth Mass Extinction Event at all. They know how to escape it. What they are worrying more is a Machine which will equals and, later surpass its brain and start producing a next generation machine of its own. this machine will consider its creator as its biggest enemy.

Will the human female be able to keep the gene pool alive and vibrant? Again we have no idea. But gentlemen we have no cause for regret. We were charged by Nature to do a job and we did that job very well, some would say too well. Would you charge your glasses - I give you a toast, to the women we have loved. \u201cDrink! Drink!

But humans have the most complex thing in the known universe. And that is our Brain. We have already survived events that would kill any other species. We have survived the ice age, we have survived when our population has dropped to 10.000,we have survived plagues that killed of millions, and we have survived 2 world wars. And when you look at the present day you will see what humans have accomplished. We can communicate over distances instantaneously,we can wipe out any species at will, we have been to the moon, we will set foot on Mars etc. And say that a meteor is coming to hit our planet. Well, we would already see it months before the event happens. And believe it or not there are already thousands of plans to stop a meteor impact. The most likely way the EARTH will be destroyed is when our Sun becomes a red giant. But that's not the end. We will be multi-planetery species long before that happens and we would be spread across the milky way galaxy. So if nothing will stop us from being a multi-planetery species we would in theory can live until the death of the last sun in our entire universe\u2026 and we are literally trillions of years before that happens ",

There is no pessimism about it, it is just what the history of life tells us. The most likely causes could be super-bacteria or viruses, resistant to all available drugs. Imagine an airborne flu virus which infects a person through the respiratory system, but instead of causing flu, causes aids. How long would it take the virus to eradicate all humanity? Just a few years, at most. Considering that we have still not been able to find a cure for aids in several decades, the devastation caused by such a virus would be unimaginable. Another possible cause might be genetically engineered pathogens, developed by rival military powers. A virus, which produces phosgene gas in the cells it infects. Some people think a virus like that is actually more likely to occur than a naturally evolved super-bug. ",

Big asteroid, like the KT event? We are all here because of the survivors of that event. And critters back then did not have shelters designed to protect from nuclear war and stocked with all the goodies needed for survival. Nuclear War? Again, many millions, likely billions of casualties. Destruction of the infrastructure of the participant countries. Disruption of the economic sectors and large-scale population movements. But extinction? Hardly. Huge areas of the planet would be untouched. Nuclear Winter? Largely debunked. World-wide pandemic? There is always a segment of any population that is naturally immune to most anything that comes along, and we have VERY advanced disease control. Natural disaster? Localized deaths. Pollution?

Remember - evolutionary pressure on our genome isn\u2019t dead, and we\u2019re still evolving as time goes on. Two examples in the last few thousand years are the appearance of a gene that allows us to digest cow\u2019s milk after adolescence and the appearance of light skin color in higher latitudes to allow more Vitamin D synthesis in sunlight. There\u2019s probably a few genes that add up to making you look more like Brad Pitt and thus improving your chances of reproducing and passing those genes on.

Contrary to The Walking Dead, plagues would probably self-resolve before we became extinct, and over-population would reduce the population to a more resource-appropriate level before we got to extinction. That is not to say that some some combination of man-made calamities, such as nuclear war brought on by climate change, overpopulation, or a global economic meltdown won\u2019t do us in.

A catastrophic meteor impact spewed so much dust, debris and gases into the atmosphere that solar radiation was blocked and the earth cooled. Dinosaurs could not adapt and went extinct. But humans have big brains and do not have to adapt genetically to a changed environment because we use technology to change the environment to suit us. Humans have lived on the moon while no other species has accomplished this. This is because humans use technology to make the environment on the moon similar to the environment on earth. Since humans are not affected by environmental changes, they will not go extinct as other species had gone extinct in the past because of environmental changes. But our big brains allowed us to invent the bomb and we may kill ourselves off and this would mean we will be the cause of our own extinction. ",

Even after a global calamity such as a super volcano or asteroid impact there will still be humans around. We are far too resourceful, mobile and intelligent to be killed off by this type of event. However, an \"earth destroying\" event such as a moon sized asteroid impact or strong gamma ray burst that sterilizes the planet would also make us extinct. Those earth destroying events are pretty rare though.  The sun will eventually make earth uninhabitable but that is billions of years away and humanity is likely to have colonized other worlds by then. ",

We've divided ourselves into various countries, nobody is united and everyone wants to beat each other up. With current world leaders flaunting their superweapons and the media spreading the propaganda that the other countries are bad, the risk of a third world war is now higher then ever and the main reason this is bad is nukes. We right now have more than enough nukes on Earth to destroy every major city on the planet, and the worst thing is the nuclear fallout spreading miles away from the area where the bomb was dropped killing even more people. If a war breaks out, it would likely result in a huge decrease in human population if not making humans extinct. So, in the end we realise that the greed of the ones in power to become temporary masters of a small piece of land is gonna kill everyone. ",

Worst case scenario we enter a new dark age and many people die of famine due to lower crop yields, exposure after losing their homes to natural disasters, or in civil wars fought over resources, but the human species as a whole would survive.

Humans (because of the accidentally, unnecessarily and disproportionately over-large human brain) have established an elaboration of their habitat which includes the use of chemical means of explosion. If they use these destructive items they may destroy the availability of food - hence they will become extinct.The timetable for this is open to question; maybe we will get lucky and avoid the plans of those crazy people who want to control - or destroy - the world and maybe not.

The current environment disaster and global overheating will probably kill hundreds of millions but that isn\u2019t extinction. About 74,000 years ago something killed off 99% of humans. It was probably the long term effects of the eruption of supervolcano Mt Toba in Sumatra. This left humans with extremely narrow genetic diversity. However, humans bounced back to the extent of the current overpopulation. ",

This would isolate a species and make it more vulnerable to cataclysmic events.The eventual end of the universe, either from a Big Rip, Heat Death, or some other mechanism, will mean that no energy will be harvestable and existence itself will be in jeopardy.I suppose an advanced civilization might be able to avoid this outcome by time traveling or escaping to another place in the multiverse, assuming these are possible.

And the reason is simple. Environments change. Evolution adapts a species to the changed environment, and hey presto new species. One species changes, another must follow a different path because the other species is now better at what it used to do, so the game keeps changing, hey presto another new species, or maybe two or three....

Some people will use their wealth to protect themselves from the adverse environmental changes, whether through novel architectures or through leaving the planet altogether.

Current trends taken into account, the more pessimistic outlook predicts we will make this planet unlivable within 50-75 years.

Immediate implementation of solutions is the only way to mitigate the impact we are having on our life support system, our \u201cplanet ocean\u201d, which mandates striking a precarious balance to fathom our existence in the future. And I don\u2019t think humanity will die out, but instead we\u2019ll speciate. There were at least half-a-dozen hominin groups wandering around Africa and Eurasia over the past couple hundred thousand years, and it\u2019s only really in the past 30-40 thousand that modern humans like us took over. My guess is that over the next 100,000 years, humanity will evolve into several more groups\u2014in part the result of genetic engineering, and in part from the usual forces of natural selection. Especially if we actually start living off-world, it\u2019s not going to make sense for us to have bodies that are vulnerable to radiation, or that require a specific balance of oxygen and nitrogen. We\u2019re not the pinnacle of evolution! Humans as we know them are just one morphological waypoint on the long road of evolution. ",

Either way, the answer is yes. It is entirely possible. Now the likelihood of either of those two scenarios happening and when it might happen is an answer I can\u2019t give you. I don\u2019t know. The chance of another six-mile-long asteroid hitting the Earth anytime soon (or the just pure chance of it happening on any one day) is extremely small. However, it did happen before, so it can happen again. The extinction of the (non-bird) dinosaurs and most other animals on the planet at the end of the Cretaceous was actually more complicated than just the coming of the asteroid. Land animals, including the dinosaurs, had been ecologically strained for a long time already. The eruption of the Deccan Traps (volcanic fields) in India preceded the K-T asteroid, and led to a volcanic winter that strained the ecology of Earth before the final blow came down from outer space. Humans are currently in the process of straining every single one of their civilizations way beyond what their resources can handle. We are entering an extremely chaotic time, and at the end, might some survive to start over? I don\u2019t know. The Yellowstone Supervolcano is the next natural mega-disaster on the horizon, and that could happen at any time. It\u2019s not the same scale as the Deccan Traps or the Siberian volcanic fields responsible for the end of the Permian, but given how strained we already are (though few of us are ready to admit it), I don\u2019t know if we can survive even that as a species now.

Earth will be gone. But hopefully with that much time humans can get to Mars for awhile, maybe terraform it first since we know these things are coming. This will give us some time. Not sure if Mars is going to be a suitable place once the sun gets to its biggest. Maybe humans can go to mars then Pluto and then eventually back to mars. Who knows when the collision of the Milky Way and andromeda galaxy happens we may find a habitable planet cruising right on by and maybe it will survive the collision. Hopefully humans by this time will have the common sense to try about 10,000 different things hoping some of them works. But humans will be extinct on Earth eventually. ",

If the human race is not wiped out by any number of catastrophic events, we will still perish when our sun dies. The sun will become a red giant and envelop all the planets closest to it, likely earth as well. Then, it will shrink into a planetary nebula, roughly the size of the earth. We do not need to be alarmist about this happening though, because the sun will not become a red giant for 5 billion years and it will be 6 billion years before it shrinks into a small planetary nebula. An impact from a close earth object can happen at practically any time though. NASA and other space agencies are actually tracking these objects and methods of planetary defense are being designed at this moment. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course it will. Every species goes extinct at some point. Nothing is forever. There are various scenarios in which human activity leads to the extinction of the species - be it the depletion of resources, run-away climate change, a devastating global war with universal radioactive fallout, a lab-grown deadly virus. Species die out when they lose the base of their existence (habitat, resources) or are killed off by another, more successful species. Humans managed to settle in most of Earth\u2019s climate zones and don\u2019t seem to allow another, more successful species that could endanger them. However the human species has some vulnerabilities: it only works as a society and requires complex interaction to survive. There is also an unprecedented degree of travel, people are constantly on the way from one continent to another, which makes it very easy for diseases to spread. On long term, some hundred millions of years into the future it will become too hot for life as we know it today to survive on Earth as the Sun will evolve into a red giant star. Some think it\u2019s a better idea if we just stop reproducing today and spare the planet the devastating effect humans have on biodiversity: VHEMT the voluntary human extinction movement. ",

            "answer_text": "The possibility of human extinction is 50-50. Humans are heavily dependent on energy sources, be it coal, petroleum or solar or any other non-conventional source. Humans having a great edge over other species in wild is also a factor of extinction. Due to this edge humans will always survive over animals. Killing out a large group of humans by an animal induced process is nearly impossible, except if it is a disease. So extinction of humans can only be caused by humans themselves. The ever growing population, hence the need of resources is also going high. The faster we run out of resources, the faster we move towards a energy less future and that would mean an end of the human civilization. For example, we have been using Lithium ion batteries in our cell phones, which have a relatively high energy storage density. But the metal \u201clithium\u201d is itself available in lot less amount to be extracted for energy storage. And if we assume that we will anyhow move ahead of burning fossil fuels. Then too, this major factor will limit our scale. ",

As you are asking that when will the humans disappear,so according to me the answer could be meteorite impact or volcanic eruption. As the dinosaurs become extinct due to climate change or adverse climatic condition or volcanic eruption. So the humans can also be disappear by the same method or so. And the topic about human extinction is currently a hot one. Humans can also disappear through mutation(change in DNA sequence). As the mutation can lead to a different organism or a complete end of it. The reason for the disappearance of humans can be stated that on this planet earth a particular life can\u2019t stay for long,everyone has to die,and life isn\u2019t immortal. Change is the basis of evolution.From the starting creature till the humans there has been numerous lives. God created life and moulding it into new forms is his duty. Humans will disappear as no creature lives for long,and evolution is a must. Generation keeps on changing better to best,you never know what happens next! Thank you for reading! ",

If time were infinite we would eventually become extinct. Why? Let's assume there are a few events in which we would die out (I.e. aliens taking over, disease of choice or whatever way you might imagine humans going extinct) All these events have a probability of happening each year, though that probability is likely very small there is one. With an infinite amount of time it is impossible that one of these events won't occur. Thus wiping out humans. Okay, but what if time is finite? Well then the human race ends when time ends.  Concluding from these two scenarios you could assume that the human race must become extinct. ",

Venus started out very much like Earth, but became uninhabitable hell due to a runaway greenhouse effect. So we know there\u2019s a danger of that destroying life on the Earth. To the other side, Mars got pulverized by large asteroid strikes, until it lost too much of its mass, all of its magnetic field, and almost all of its atmosphere. If we then look back at our moon, we could see it scarred with craters. In its history, it has taken a lot of large hits that would have otherwise landed on Earth. The Moon itself was created by a huge impact. So, we have three examples right there that illustrates the greatest dangers life on Earth faces. The runaway greenhouse effect should scare us the most, since there\u2019s a danger we could trigger that, just by accident and pigheaded ignorance. There are other ways we can go extinct, but if you ask me, our planetary neighborhood shows us the most important ones. ",

As landmass moves towards north eventually we will have another ice age on our hands which will kill most of the living creatures and the survivors will evolve into other creatures but that is 5 million years away. As for the evolution part, all living things will evolve as the years go by to cope with changes in nature. The HUMAN DNA changes every 20000 years so in the next 100000 years we humans will change 5 times and could turn into a new kind of an animal. Our DNA has already created people of all sorts of shapes and races so why not change us into a new species. ",

            "answer_text": "Extinction has a purpose that isn\u2019t recognized yet by science. It is a form of death on a scale larger than the individual. The same way that death results in eventual rebirth again as human, so does extinction from earth result in a new descent into form on a subsequent planet. I have read that a chain of globes is seven planets and that the grand cycle for an evolving human kingdom is completed in 7 rounds through these 7 globes. This is our 4th time evolving in forms on earth and there will be three more additional periods of evolution after a sequence of evolution which occurs on the other six globes. The extinction is a natural result of pairing with a higher kingdom. Evolving animals had humans descend into their physical existence and in a period of 3 races, the animal was first influenced, then shared a body, and then was replaced by the descending human life within the form because the evolving animal becomes less physical in an ascension process. The evolving animal forces the incoming evolving human into physical existence because the two energies interact in such a way that the human gets entrusted with activities within the form since the human can accomplish things better. As the evolving animal observes human mental and physical activities, it becomes less and less fitted to the form it is in and eventually works its way out of life that isn\u2019t suited to it. The logical result is to move to the next globe where evolving plants are waiting for their ascension out of form as part of their growth process. ",

Even if a natural catastrophe like an asteroid strike doesn\u2019t do for us, we may well annihilate ourselves through war or runaway tech or human induced climate change and ecological collapse sooner or later. I think we are too precocious to last for very long. Unlike the dinosaurs, dim, but stable, persisting for 200 mlllion years, humans I think will be more like one of nature\u2019s fireworks, spectacular, but because of that, very short lived. ",

Still, humanity has proven extremely adaptable and scientific discoveries are now on an exponential curve. I remain optimistic that the human species(or what we evolve into) will survive for a long time to come. One major concern: the First world countries are not reproducing enough to replace their populations and the Third world will follow suit as they modernize.

Star Wars and Star Trek notwithstanding, because of the inconceivably vast distances that would have to be covered to take human populations to exoplanets, even within our galaxy, and the difficulty of choosing an apt destination for such travel in the first place, humankind is probably forever stuck with Earth as its only life-conducive environment.

Sure, not excluding alien invasions or the Apocalypse either. Humanity for all its flaws has the will to survive anything.

Our current greatest threat would be a nuclear fallout, supervolcanoes, or an astroid similar to the one that wiped out the dinosaurs, either of these things could easily have worldwode repercussions. Such as blocking out the suns energy from reaching our planet and therefore creating a fallout that could last for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years. These scenarios are unlikely. What is most likely is that we will reach a certain point whence we have so many options of genetic manipulation and technology integration into the human body that we will undoubtedly become completely different and multiple species and at one point homo sapiens will likely be too far behind and will be out brawned and outnumbered.

His prediction is that we lose Arctic summer ice within 38 months and heating from the release of methane cooks the planet in a Permian style extinction that may well leave the planet sterile. Other scientists have predicted a loss of Arctic ice within the next three to five years, though not all of them are as pessimistic as Light. There was also a 2016 prediction of loss of ice within 3 years by the Naval Postgraduate college. Some scientists assert that the only reason we didn\u2019t lose the ice last year is because of the massive clouds of soot raised by the record California wildfires last summer. The soot and other particulate blocked out solar heat that otherwise would have melted the ice. I\u2019m hoping they\u2019re all incorrect, but we haven\u2019t had this much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in several million years and the precedents aren\u2019t encouraging. ",

In the Bible it tells us how everything God created was good. So I believe God created everything. Also, the Bible tells us about Judgement Day. An occasional moment Jesus descends from heaven (outerspace doesn't exist) to earth. The dead will rise and everything will change. That exact moment that people arise from the dead will mean that all humans bodies have changed. To suppose or translate what the Bible tells us about Judgement Day details, I don't have them. It isn't my place to throw around assumptions or senarios but human life will have been changed by God. Judgement Day is an unknown event that ultimately does happen. Thanks for requesting an answer. I can only speak on this honestly. ",

It\u2019s been found that my bird and all birds still retain dinosaur biological traits like having bone tissues which activate when the female is preparing shells for the eggs in her womb, having feathers, having nest-making instinct and some other things. But many species which exist today are \u201creplacements\u201d of previous editions which have gone extinct. All species so far have gone extinct except for the latest editions (and I do mean \u201ceditions\u201d). So every creature we see today is a relatively recent arrival just as the now-extinct species once were. Humans became the latest edition of a previous species and we\u2019ll become extinct just as all the others have done in the past. It\u2019s one of the most certain fact-based pieces of knowledge known. Lastly, the exact process of extinctions are known to be various. There are plenty of species which have disappeared just because the environment changed too much or too fast for any adaptations to preserve the species. The causes of the periodic \u201cgreat\u201d extinctions has also varied. The Permian Extinction had a cause or causes different from the Cretaceous Extinction. The Permian Extinction killed off 90\u201395% of all species on Earth. Dinosaurs were of many species and so were other \u201cclans\u201d in both the Permian and Cretaceous extinctions. But humans have only ONE surviving species variant and even the larger Great Apes have only a few members. It took a great extinction event to get all but one kind of dinosaurs. Any kind of extinction will easily end our species and we\u2019re the only species in our \u201cclan.\u201d How survivable is that? ",

Maybe after 2100 or so. Till that time, mankind would surely have developed a new colony somewhere else or may have found a new home planet. Its not that human race will not end. It\u2019ll end surely for there is no thing made by Nature which lives for lifetime, but it's just that humans will stretch out their ruling period in this universe to unimaginable levels. ",

What i,m getting at , is that in the future people may truly be able to clone\u2026just like growing a plantation of people..The question is \u2026can they build on that and make a super human. Of course we can. We all know history. The romans, The egyptians, even Hitler has tried to make a more advanced man by breeding, and according to documentation, the humans turned out with better physical traits. Did you ever notice that the majority of athletes have better teeth than others. I'm not saying all of them \u2026but more than others.. Is that a coincidence maybe. But maybe there is a genome in the strand that makes that happen. Science will find out what humans will need to survive ..That is\u2026 if it is not interrupted by catastrophic extinction. Can humanoids exist with robotic arms and legs. Yes we can. \u2026.can we exist with an artificial memory. Yes we can..maybe not yet.. but the future is just around the corner.

Well to stop genetic issues, we may need a few men and women but that\u2019s another story. But another world war will come, civil wars will come even in the west. I can see that in the west the majority is being slowly diminished by the minority, and eventually the majority will be the minority and will then fight back. Again this is human nature.

If you think of humanity as the entire lineage of genus Homo, then it will probably take a LOT longer for our species to evolve into something which can no longer be classified as genus Homo. Perhaps a million years. Perhaps even longer. But I do think it will be our choice. I think it\u2019s very unlikely for our taxonomic branch to die off completely.

Here are a few of those possibilities, that could eventually lead to our extinction, which are the result of mankind\u2019s irreverence and disregard for our vast interconnected and convoluted ecosystems. 1) The irreparable decimation of our tropical rain forests by human activities for greed. This will lead to the crossing over of diseases from one species to another. Thus, a disease that infects monkeys could cross the species barrier and then infect pigs. Afterwards, we\u2019d consume the contaminated pork, succumb to the lethal toxins of the unknown disease, and then die either posthaste or slowly while experiencing excruciating pain with no cure in sight. 2) The irrevocable slaughter of the ocean\u2019s marine life, via man made pollutants, would lead to the infection of our marine food sources with obscure diseases that are resistant to our antibiotics. Of course, death would the end result. 3) Plus, the destruction of the tropical rain forest (canopy) and the ocean\u2019s life forms (phytoplankton in its upper layers) would lead to a rapid depletion of the atmospheric oxygen which sustains life on this planet. Especially since plant life is responsible for the release of oxygen (a by-product), via photosynthesis, into the atmosphere. At the same time, planetary temperatures would soar because there won\u2019t be enough plant life to produce cloud formations via cellular respiration through photosynthesis. After all, clouds are responsible for reflecting sunlight back into space. ",

If environmental scientists are correct, it is inevitable and not as far away as we might think. It is already too late to save the oceans. No matter what we do, they are dying. Sadly, the rate of destruction by pollution and over-fishing has not decreased, rather, increased.  10 years ago they gave the oceans between 30 and 50 years. Over 90% of the fish stocks are now gone and there are now actual battles being fought over the remainder.  Ocean life is dying from both ends. From the plankton up, and the wholesale slaughter of apex predators at the top. If the oceans die, we die. It\u2019s that stark.

It will mean a redistribution of life on the scale of earlier global mass extinction events.

            "answer_text": "Original question: Are humans going to go extinct soon? I don\u2019t think we are going to extinct soon. For getting extinct you need to be linked to a small niche. When this niche change you disappear. The vast majority of species getting extinct today are species living in a very tinny area of the Earth and depending on a very specific environment. Species with few individuals and therefore few genetic baggage. Species occupying a large niche can disappear, but that need a large world-scale change. It is easier for dodos to disappear than for rats. More wildly a species is spread less likely it can get extinct. Humans live everywhere on earth, with lots off different sources of food, different climates, different ecosystems. Human are also very resilient due to their intelligence. The Ester Island example shows us that a small group of humans, isolated, can survive a radical change in their environment (the extinction of all trees) without going extinct. Mutiny on the Bounty is an other example of a small groups of humans surviving against all odds, on a small virgin island (Pitcairn Island). I can\u2019t imagine a crisis affecting every human population at the same time (with the exception of a supernova or a big asteroid, but supernovas and big asteroids are uncommon). Of course, there is the possibility of an atomic war. But an atomic war will wipe-out cities, not zones with a low population density. So the civilization will collapse, but the humanity will not die. Epidemics can\u2019t wipe-out everybody. The worst epidemic in the human history was the Black Death, caused by the yersinia pestis bacterium. In a decade 50% of the European population was killed. Two century only where needed for the population to get back to the pre-plague level. And it was before modern medicine. ",

Alternatively the current human species could evolve into a distinctly different species over time. Alternatively another species could develop that destroys the human race over time (highly virulent and fatal virus). These are a few possibilities. The greatest insurance of species survival is to disperse across many habitable environments. Ultimately this means extraterrestrial and extrasolar colonization. ",

Most people do not seem to realize just how difficult it is to kill every human being. Humans are among the most adaptable species on the planet, and the most adaptable tetrapod, as demonstrated by our ancestors which colonized every climate without modern technology. If US and Russia dump all their nuclear arsenals on each other, it just means Polynesians and Argentinians will re-populate the Earth, although they might have to spend a few years salvaging canned food from drifting hulks. If we never colonize other planets, then I expect cycles of boom and bust, each lasting several thousand years, and each leaving enough human beings to repopulate the Earth over and over again. We already used up all easily extractable fossil fuels, so the next cycle will not have that particular energy source to turbocharge development, but it matters little. With alcohol-derived fuels and solar power, humanity can still go from Iron Age to Space Age, just not as fast. ",

Something smaller, like the K-Pg bolide that eliminated the (non-avian) dinosaurs we might ride out, but there comes a point where the impact energy is too great for any complex organism to survive. Nothing terrestrial is capable of causing our extinction[1], so the question boils down to how fast our technology evolves vs. how close that nemesis bolide is. Statistically speaking it must be out there in the oort cloud somewhere so we may only have a few million years at most to figure out how to stop it. [1] Based on fossil and geological evidence I don\u2019t believe ice ages, volcanos or climate changes are capable of eliminating humans. Killing off a few billion of us, sure - but extinction: no.

We as humans are destroying the planet in immensely profound ways. Now, this is not going to be some huge lecture about climate change or rising sea levels or pollution as, even without any of these, we are still detrimentally disadvantageous to ourselves in the way we harm our planet. A few months ago, I brought a book from Barnes & Noble that goes into a decent level of detail as to how we are wreaking havoc on the planet.  In this book are pages such as these which help explain graphically/with pictures and in short descriptions how we are wrecking the planet we live on.    Now, the book details some solutions to the many problems it brings up, but we are not here to discuss that. We as humans mess up our natural habitat in profound amounts of ways. Our current lifestyles requires immense amounts of energy, food, water and land. We require tons of metal, wood, and ores extracted from the earth to further maintain our status of living. This is all even while assuming global warming is not occurring, but the rising sea levels and increased carbon emissions are only adding greater pressure on our demands. And a simple fact that most people wish to ignore is that our planet is not finite. Scientists around the world have been guesstimating the amount of time it would take for a resource we often use to become permanently wiped out. Articles such as these highlight the fact that we are wiping out resources on our planet. All seafood will run out in 2050, say scientists How long will fossil fuels last? (This article asserts that at current technological levels and usage levels, oil will run out in about 32 years) Earth has lost a third of arable land in past 40 years, scientists say Now, although these articles may not be entirely accurate (i.e. we could still have seafood by 2050), they all highlight the unspoken fact that resources are simply not infinite. This is by virtue of our planet not being infinite in nature. Some day, whether in 20 or 2,000 years or even longer, we will deplete our planet of its natural resources. It is inevitable to occur at the rate we use them and it will only increase with populations rising. Can this be offset with changes to our behaviors and habits? Perhaps. But maintaining the status quo is the most efficient way to wipe us out at the moment. ",

So even if we were to escape a zero progenitor evolutkon and classify our distant decendants as humanplus or something then we as we stand genetically right now will still all be gone. A little in the way the child that became YOU is long gone. But can you point to a day when you were not a child? ",

However, it's likely we will either evolve into another species or more than one species, or we will kill ourselves doing something we shouldn't. I find it unlikely that we will evolve into more than one species since we have such extensive globalization now, but you never know. I think it's most likely that we will kill ourselves doing something we shouldn't or some other catastrophic event will put us on the path to either being the end of the line or speciation. ",

After that would be humans, with the caveat that slow or short events could be mitigated by human technology. Bats and birds will probably be the last generic groups to go because of their motility. Yes, humans could go extinct. But mammals will carry on in the form of bats, just like dinosaurs carry on in the form of birds. ",

Maybe we actually exist in computers in a time far in the past but extrapolated into the future for our understanding and experience. I mean, how would we know right? If this is the case.

I also think that once human populations are decimated things will reach a stabilization point. Small numbers of people may be able to survive depending on the specific conditions. I also think that as AI takes over management of resources our societies will be able to reorganize and survive to the degree that people are willing to utilize sustainable practices. I do think it\u2019s likely we will see a large scale viral infection, fighting over essential resources, and a breakdown of the natural processes we depend on due to our hunger for money.

Particularly with nations that hold larger populations. Another contributing factor to consider when it comes to the ever growing emissions problem is with climate intervention practices. The deliberate dumping of nano particulates into the atmosphere has been going on for quite some time now without the public (worldwide for that matter) even taking notice to it. Hazy skies have become a normal thing, meanwhile patents are coming out for crops that can withstand contaminated soils.

Very possible scenarios that are brewing now: Through the over-use of antibiotics at an individual level, we collectively breed a super-virus that kills anyone who comes into contact with it and for which there is no cure. Through the decimation of our global forests to generate individual income, we cripple the planet\u2019s ability to produce enough oxygen for all the living organisms that need it to breathe and we suffocate. Through continued production of waste and pollution by billions of individuals and organizations going about their daily business, we continue to endanger and extinguish species that perform important functions in the global ecosystem until the food chain collapses and we all starve to death. Through continued hyper-consumption of fossil fuels (particularly through each individual\u2019s use of a car) we change the chemical composition of our atmosphere enough that one of several very bad scenarios comes to pass:We warm up the planet\u2019s temperature enough that it becomes uninhabitable to humans and other species, which could nail us either directly or indirectly (through one of the other mechanisms above - kill the forests, collapse the food chain, etc.)We warm up the planet\u2019s temperature enough that lots more water is turned to vapor than is now, which increases the cloud cover, which creates a white, highly reflective cloud surface enveloping the planet which prevents sunlight from reaching the earth\u2019s surface, which causes temperatures to drop, which expands frozen areas which are also reflective and white, which accelerates the process until the earth freezes into a snowball (it has evidently happened to the planet before - more than once)We cross any number of invisible thresholds where \u201cthings change\u201d in ways not so good for our biology - chemical composition of the air suddenly changes (and becomes toxic), structure and composition of the atmosphere suddenly changes (as it did with the ozone problem), etc. Basically, humans can only survive under a very narrow range of conditions. At a minimum we need temperate climate, shelter, food, water, and air and we need to be free of disease and chemical toxins. Through our own actions we are actively and rapidly undermining the global systems that support all of these conditions. It\u2019s like we\u2019re racing each other to see which system we can destroy first - and the winner of that race will likely determine how humans go extinct. ",

No other animal consciously destroys the very environment it is dependent upon for survival, except for the human. In our ignorant quest to destroy the planet, we are also causing the elimination of millions of other animal and plant species. Earth is currently in the midst of the sixth mass extinction. The previous extinctions, mostly attributed to climate change, killed an estimated 75% to 96% of all living things. Want to read more of this article? Here! You\u2019re welcome!

So we are due for another one. However it is still unlikely that a meteor that size will collide with us and even more unlikely that it will kill 100 percent of the human race.

Go to Mars if you must but it's still not a place to raise the kids and it's for damn sure, Cold as Hell! BTW. Carl Sagan warned us that the technology to nudge an asteroid out of a path with Earth could also be misused to nudge one into danger, which hadnt occurred to me and now makes me think of all the unknown unknowns.

But one day the earth will reach its lifespan and die. All species, including humankind, will not be supported anymore by the earth. All will die. But there will be a new earth to support life. Humankind will reappear again. Likewise, animals will appear again. The point is there are many earth like planets in other universes. In fact, they are infinite but not all of them support life. Nonetheless, the planets or earths that support life are innumerable. They are just countless. The law of kamma (cause and effect) is the law of nature. Buddhism explains how this law functions. A function is rebirth. Those who died elsewhere can be reborn here on our planet. ",

As many have noted, in the system that is our Universe, the most significant punctuation point for life would be that of the ecosystem; all and every living creature becomes extinct, when it fails to adapt to changes in its ecosystem. The conditions on the surface of Venus would challenge any species, let alone humans. We risk creating somewhat similar challenges here. We just have to hope that if our folly must persist, that it is self limiting; that the increase in global temperatures will only destroy the majority of us, and our uncontrolled populations, so reducing our continued malign impact, and avoiding a runaway Venus type eco-busting atmospheric outcome. A world government might avert this without so much misery, but we seem to have been seriously incapable of creating that in the condensed time scales that unregulated technological changes have created. Ironically, in view of H. G. Wells and his masterly science fiction classic, to any hypothetical Martian we must surely look more like the mindless virus than the planetary power. ",
