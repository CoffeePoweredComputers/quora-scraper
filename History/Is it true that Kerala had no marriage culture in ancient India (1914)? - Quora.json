This question carries a link of a Facebook Post which I posted in 2015  The post went viral with numerous shares and re-shares which included a few personalities like reputed cinematographer Santhosh Sivan, scriptwriter/director Shankar Ramakrishnan etc. Infact I too never expected this post would go so much viral. The aim of the post wasn\u2019t talking about Nair customs or traditions, rather the crucial part of highlighting, how CHANGE IS INEVITABLE. Change is always bound to happen, whether you curse it or welcome it as without change, we would still be stuck in the caves\u2026 This post was a response to a prominent Nair leader of RSS/BJP gang in Kerala who was so bashing in media that time about the necessity to protect traditions and customs for the benefit of the younger generation. The intention of the post to remind of Nair traditions and customs of past which no Nairs would like to continue today.  Now to the question Is it true that Kerala had no marriage culture in ancient India (1914)? Answer is NO Kerala indeed had a marriage culture since times immemorial just like any other human community do have.  Kerala Marriage, a representative image All communities do have the concept of marriage and families as like anywhere in the world. However, one community differed. Marriage as an institutional custom and modern concept of family (Husband-Wife-Children) as an institution was essentially ABSENT among Nair community specifically. They followed the unique concept of matrilineal inheritance model which doesn\u2019t follow the patrilineal family structure as we see today, due to which they didn\u2019t have institution of marriage or family structure as we understand. I explained that in very detail in below answer of mine https://www.quora.com/What-is-Sambandham-in-Kerala/answer/Arun-Mohan-\u0d05\u0d30\u0d41\u0d7a-\u0d2e\u0d4b\u0d39\u0d7b Apart from the Nair community, this custom was existing among Royals (Samantha Kshyatriyas who were essentially Nairs, who were deemed to be Kshyatriyas thro\u2019 rituals) and certain sects of Ambalavasi communities. These 3 groups make the forward caste groups of Kerala, which you may read in the below link. Arun Mohan (\u0d05\u0d30\u0d41\u0d7a \u0d2e\u0d4b\u0d39\u0d7b)'s answer to I'm learning about Indian castes etc., I would to like know the ranking of these groups - Nairs, Nambudiri, Iyer (Tamil), Iyengar.? Rest all other communities in Kerala, be it Hindu communities of Ezhavas, Thiyyas, other professional castes, Dalits and backward communities, as well as Muslims and Christians all, had the institution of Marriage and modern structure of the family. And Kerala is not just all about Nairs/Royals. It should be noted, Nairs even today constitute only 15\u201320% of entire Kerala Hindu society, so essentially they are not so big community to say, their customs represent the entire Hindu community of Kerala. But Nairs were the most influential community in Kerala who helmed all the power corridors as well as the military might of the kingdoms. Along with them, Royals also practised all Nair customs and traditions, thus even the Kings/Queens were into this custom. This means the tradition of matrilineal culture (please note- its NOT MATRIARCHIAL) is regarded as superior or elitist among locals as it was the custom of royalty and nobility.  Now, again, Nairs is not a single caste community. It has more than 200 subcastes and smaller divisions within it. The lower strata of the Nair community weren\u2019t much into matrilineal inheritance model, so they had normal marriages and family structure. This concept is more seen among the middle and upper strata of Nair communities. Arun Mohan (\u0d05\u0d30\u0d41\u0d7a \u0d2e\u0d4b\u0d39\u0d7b)'s answer to How politically strong is Nair community in Kerala? Are they powerful enough to make or break any political party? (similar to Yadav community of Bihar which made RJD very strong) Essentially, the middle and upper Nairs do dominate the tag of Nair prominence, so much of the people do assume every Nairs practised Matrilineal inheritance model.  Nair-Mappilla concept of marriage It should be noted, prior to 11th century, most communities in Kerala practised patrilineal inheritance model, including the Chera Emperors. Due to this, Chera Emperors used to marry and their wives were queens and the throne being inherited by sons. But post-collapse of Chera Empire and with the rise of Brahminical powers, the new Matrilineal inheritance model came primarily to an extremely decentralized system of governance (rise of more than 500 fiefdoms/kingdoms) and issue of limited land. The whole model of Matrillinealism was designed to ensure the properties of ruling upper caste communities don\u2019t get divided and remains in a consolidated form. I explained in detail in one of the above answers. Apart from Nairs, another community which practised this model was Muslims, particularly Mappila Muslims of Malabar (as well as in some in Central Kerala). Mappila community always saw themselves as a sort of extension of the Nair community (because they always believed their mother lineage were of Nairs while only father lineage from the Arab community). Due to this belief among Nairs, they maintained many concepts as similar to the Nair community and always seen in the same equal ranking in Malabar. Muslims also practised Marumakathayam traditions (Matrilineal inheritance) untill the 1930s. But unlike Nairs, Mappillas had the concept of marriage (Nikah). But Nikah is exactly not like the general Hindu concept of marriage. In the Hindu concept, marriage essentially means relationship for 7 lives and its meant forever\u2026 Nikah, on the other hand, is a contract between two adults, who agrees to live together. It can be terminated at the will of any party (Husband/Wife) as Talaq (in Malayalam- Mozhicholluka). So essentially the very concept of Nikah is quite similar to Nair concept of Sambandam (consensual relationship). Both Nairs and Mappilas had no restriction in making and terminating relationships at will. The only difference is that Sambandam tradition doesn\u2019t make both parties as Husband-Wife, rather remains as co-inhabitants (Sambandakaran) while Nikah makes proper Husband-wife relationship untill termination. So as another difference is that, Nair women can enter into multiple Sambandam relationships (multiple relationships with men) while Muslim ladies can have only one active husband at a time. Only after the termination of a relationship, she can enter into another relationship, unlike Nair ladies who can enjoy 2 or 3 relationships at a time. Another difference is that Sambandakaran (Male Coinhabitor) has no legal relationship with the female as the relationship is just meant for a consensual live-in relationship, not any sort of permanent obligations. The Sambandakaran has no responsibilities over his children (as its mother\u2019s responsibility) and has no rights over the lady or children in any manner. Whereas in Muslim tradition, as long as Nikah remains, the husband has a direct relationship with his wife and owes the responsibility to his children. But Mappilla law and Nair law converge at a single point- Legacy of a family moves via female, not male. That means a child\u2019s family is that of the mother\u2019s, not father\u2019s. Father has no direct lineage over his child. Due to this reason, both Mappillas and Nairs don\u2019t allow their ladies to move to their husband\u2019s home after marriage as ladies continue their family\u2019s legacy and cannot transfer their legacy to any other. So in both communities, the husband/sambandakaran comes and lives with wife at wife house untill termination. After the termination of the relationship, the father will lose rights over his children forever.  Nampoothiri concept of marriage It should be understood, the system of Matrilineal inheritance model was brought by Nampoothiris as part of rising Brahminical powers post-Chera Empire era. But Nampoothiris like any other Brahmin community believed in Patrilineal inheritance model, ie father-to-son model. However, they designed a very unique model within the community primarily aimed to prevent any sort of partition or division of properties.  Nampoothiri marriages known for its elaborate customs and traditions, much in similarity with several other Brahmin communities elsewhere Only the elder male of each Nampoothiri family can legally marry a Nampoothiri lady and produce Namboothiri offsprings. Rest all Nampoothiri males in the family cannot legally marry, rather has to enter into Sambandam with Nair or royal communities. By this way, their children shall not be treated as Nampoothiris, rather as their mother\u2019s caste (Nairs, Kshatriyas etc). So there won\u2019t be any case of division of property within Nampoothiri family as only one male inherits all properties. So it should be noted, while Nampoothiri males (barring eldest) were all into matrilineal traditions, the Nampoothiri ladies suffered a lot. They cannot be polyandrous as Nair women can as they have to maintain their chastity values. At the same time, there were no enough Nampoothiri men in the society to marry as only one from a family can legally marry. This lead to the problem, the elder one of a family has to marry the maximum number of Nampoothiri girls as possible to ensure their community ladies have marriages and relationships. This means many Nampoothiri men even in the 60s or 70s have to marry young girls in teens or 20s as the number of men eligible to marry was too low in their community.  Rest all communities in Kerala did have marriages. And essentially they form the absolute majority too. Out of this, Thiyya community in Malabar which was once an upper caste (then relegated as lower caste in later classifications) had very elaborate marriage rituals and customs. Thiyyas had the concept of child marriage called Kettu Kalyanam. This is not something similar to the North Indian style of child Marriage, rather more of an engagement function. Thiyyas traditionally were an endogamous community as they married only within the community, more commonly within the family. The elders used to engage their child\u2019s marriage with relative\u2019s kids when both attain an age of 10 years old with proper marriage like function called Kettu Kalynam. But it doesn\u2019t mean the girl kid goes away from her home to her husband home etc, rather they continue to live as how they used to live as the ceremony was more like an engagement of assurance of marriage. Actual marriage happens only when they attain puberty and becomes an adult.  Kettu Kalyanam of Thiyyas shown so elaborately in the movie- Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha as related to Chandu\u2019s marriage with Unniyarcha as well as Aromal\u2019s with Thumbolarcha (all these characters being extreme popular Kerala Warriors) At that time, it's possible to break the engagement and marry someone-else, if the better proposal comes in by giving compensation to the child husband and handing over the Thali (wedlock). However, even for Thiyyas, they don\u2019t have the utmost sanctity for marriages. It's never Ek Chutki Sindoor ki Kimat values of marriage in most of the Hindu communities of Kerala. For Thiyyas, their marriages can be divorced at the will of any party. The concept of divorce among Thiyyas was similar to Nair community\u2019s Sambandham termination as ladies or males weren\u2019t expected to live forever with one husband or wife forever. Among the biggest Hindu community- Ezhavas, they always had the institution of marriage with the proper husband-wife relationship. But prior to the reformation of the 1900s, Ezhava community was heavily polyandrous and polygamous. It means it was very much possible for a woman to have two husbands legally wedded and live normally, so as men to have more than one wife. Ezhavas were a patrilineal community, so after marriage, the lady moves to the husband\u2019s house. But the lady can marry anyone else within the husband family upon mutual agreement with the husband and her inlaws (outsiders weren\u2019t allowed). Whereas a man can marry new ladies and bring to the home. The lady at home was also free to divorce at will. In such a case, she returns back to her home or an independent home. Ezhava community always had a sort of proxy marriage which was unique to them. A groom would send his thali (wedlock) along with marriage dress to the bride thro\u2019 someone else, mostly his relatives and the elder sister among them places the wedlock (Thali) on the bride\u2019s neck. This was necessary because Ezhavas were working population and never had time enough to attend marriages as such. This resulted in a lack of sanctity of marriages among their community. That's one key reason for having polyandrous and polygamous relationships within them. These customs ended due to hard efforts of Sree Narayana Guru, the famous social reformer from Ezhava Community. Sree Narayana Guru advocated the concept of Monogamy relationship- single relationship for a lifetime etc and instilled the idea of marrying in front of the fire (which like Nampoothiri wedding) to ensure sanctity of marriage.  Compared to Hindus and Muslims, Christian and Jew communities had more or less a Marriage/family life concept as we see today. Both these religious advocates the concept of heavenly marriage, hence for them it had utmost sanctity and relationship are made once in a lifetime forever. Due to this reason, for Jewish and Christian communities of Kerala, there was NO CONCEPT OF TERMINATION OF MARRIAGE (Divorce) at all traditionally. Christians used to see divorce as a sort of sin and violation of divine order. So essentially these communities had utmost reverence to the institution of marriage and family life.  So essentially yes, Marriage as a social institution did exist in Kerala for centuries Marriage as an institution came to Nair Community mostly after the 1930s, especially with the passing of Malabar Nair Regulation Act 1912, Cochin Nayar Act 1135 ME, Travancore Nair Law 1912, 1925 and Travancore Marumakathayam Act 1932, Madras Act 17 of 1939 etc which made drastic changes in Nair community by legalizing the institution of family order of Husband-Wife relationship as well as legalizing the concept of Marriage (Kalyanam) as a social order instead of traditional Consensual relationship (Sambandam-live-in relations). But other communities had laws related to marriage, so no specific government legalisations were made to institutionalize Marriage concept. ",

            "answer_text": "It is sad to learn that Kerala had a totally spoiled and low moralled culture uptil the end of 19th century.Even while the British women( who are now the most westernized ) in India covered themselves up in modest gowns the dalit and lower caste women were not allowed to cover up their upper bodies. A few handful of powerful Kerala brahmins totally demoralised the hindu society in Kerala.they even introduced the concept of sambandham,in which Brahmin men need not marry a particular woman and take them home ,instead could make up contracts with any number of Nair women whom they could meet at their residence whenever they wanted.these women could be disowned like terminating a contract and later some other grey haired wealthy old Brahmin would come up for screwing.Also it was a popular belief that the seed of a Brahmin could make your race pure,which made these women believe that it was a great fortune to be screwed by someone older than their grandfather.Even a Nair husband had very limited powers.He had to move out fearing harsh actions ,when a Brahmin knocked at the door of his contracted wife. These same evil traditions( which made swami vivekananda compare Kerala to a lunatic asylum) are responsible for the large number conversions which have occured in kerala.Today only little more than half of the population of Kerala are hindus,while the neighbouring states have more than 90%. All credits to some horny hungry old men. ",
