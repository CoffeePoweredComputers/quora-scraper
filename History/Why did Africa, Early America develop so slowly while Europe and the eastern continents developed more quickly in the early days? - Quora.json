            "answer_text": "Once you have poured water into wine you cannot pour it out again. What did Europe gain from exploding across all other continents? (1) It gained an immense number of resources, skills and knowledge it encountered and then made use of  - at least as long as they did not become too arrogant and stopped learning from the zillion designs to deal with humankind\u00b4s shared challenges and tasks. (2) Europeans from parochial and self-restricting, authority-restrained post-Roman-Empire Europe learned that there were always alternatives to the ways they were accustomed to. It was an explosion of horizons opening. Exploration was a crash-course in creativity. (This, however, was stifled when Europeans decided they were the sole authentic teachers of the world.) When the borders between the continents fell there was the chance of a global universalism of a humankind competing cooperatively. Enlightenment titans like Immanuel Kant envisaged an ethics that would make the individual understand the humanity and humankind at his / her very core and act in his /her own interest cooperatively. This, of course, required a global parliament and a global constitution. (And Kant and other Enlightenment greats knew that.) For a short time we had a global cross pollination with Reggae, Blues, Bossa Nova, Capoeira, Kung Fu, Asian meditation and Daoism interfacing and interacting globally. In the mean time all of these cultural energies have been streamlined and copyrighted by Europe and Euro-America. Europeans were extremely good in spotting weaknesses in the othercontinental humankind. One could use Africans, Asians and native Americans to subjugate themselves. Offer them junior partnerships and raise the level of their greed. Unfortunately Europeans had to sacrifice unniversalist Christianity as well as universalist Enlightenment in their Imperialist venture (thus gutting core elements of their own culture). Furthermore the feeding frenzy vis-a-vis three continents turned European nations against each other. This frenzy mulitplied when some nations invented the crackpot idea of colonizing other European societies in tricontinental fashion.  Anthropologists may have started as employees of colonial powers to make indigenes obey more efficiently. We, however, now have an anthropology that can teach us how to look at Europeans and EuroAmericans from the point of view of othercontinental natives. Africans tend to \"believe\" in ancestors. The dead in the single graves and in the many, many mass graves are crying out for peace and amnetic solidarity. The \"natives\" AND the millions of grunts in colonial armies vanishing in global wars want us to find solutions where they failed. Humans can placate the dead and create new forms of cooperative intelligence. ",

            "answer_text": "Geography played so much back then (and sometimes even now). Isolation, no big domestic animals, heat, a much greater plethora of diseases, bad soil... Nothing gone well for America and Africa. In America, the problem was the scarcity of people. There could hardly be any empires in US, because people didn't fight enough for land to claim it. In Europe, people fought over land, because it provided soil for crops, that wasn't the case in hunter-gatherer societies. The constant fight developed two very important things: 1) gave value to scientific progress 2) made quite effective ruleship. So Africa and America were doomed since the Stone Age, since there was no land to fight over. ",
