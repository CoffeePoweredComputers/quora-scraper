            "answer_text": "Public administration is highly analytical and dynamic subject, but you can easily cover the syllabus of within 3\u20134 months and thereafter you can revise and think, try to link the administartive theories infact any topic given in syllabus to contemporary problems of the nation and as well as world. Let me tell you an illustration in a question there was asked, \u201cIs public administration been narcotized and robbed by economics.comment\u201d. Look this question you get raw idea that its difficult to say like that. Administrative man cannot work purely economical way, he has to consider values while decision making like custom, tradition etc. (Simon bounded rationality model)Law of demand and supply is famous law of economics cannot be purely applied in public administration sense.Public Administration is vast carrying vast activities in this welfare state. Welfare of people is given keen importance like same said in Kautilya arthshastra.Even economics branch like welfare economic on which amritya sen got Nobel prize, considering welfare and HdiPublic administarton concept and economic concept like HDI help administrator to look overall view of welfare economics and take future action based of policy analysis.So here it is wrong to state that Public administration is narcotized and robbed by economic but actually values makes them different from each other. It doesn't means the both brances are different but they are integrated in a sense that both having the subjct fumctions and principles. So this type of questions can be asked in civil services. Regarding sources you can have ample number of books and reports to look upon: Public administration by fadia Public administration polinaidu Administrative rheory prasad etc In Indian administration Rajni goyal book 2 arc reports and most important current affairs Here most of material is outdated so supplement with current events. Thanks you ",
