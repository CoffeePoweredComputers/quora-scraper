            "answer_text": "Several reasons. The war in Spain was going awful and the national debt was at an all time high. And all the vassals of France were beginning to smell blood in the water. Napoleon knew that and in response created a massive military force of which no nation would dare challenge, and he was for the most part correct. Russia was quite afraid that the recent creation of the Duchy of Warsaw was in fact a staging point for a possible invasion, there had been up to this point quite the war of words and not too subtle threats due to the continuation of trade with England in breach of the Continental system which aimed to strangle the Island out of the lucrative trade with Europe which should have bolstered the flagging French economy. As a result Russia in 1811 made plans for an offensive war to invade Warsaw and Danzig. Thus was born the \u201cFirst Polish war\u201d. The threat to this newly liberated nation was the excuse needed to bring Russia under the heel once again under the continental system. As we know that was not the result. His defeat also meant the end of independence once again for the Polish and Lithuanians who had greatly benefited from the French Empire liberating them from Austria and Prussia and Russia up to that point.

            "answer_text": "In fact Napoleon did not intend to invade Russia but to meet its army and defeat it on the battlefield thus forcing the Russians to negotiate. This had worked before with the other European powers and even the Russians at Austerlitz. Unfortunately for him, the Russians refused him this ultimate confrontation and made intelligent use of their vast territory and climate. ",
