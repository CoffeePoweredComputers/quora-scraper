            "answer_text": "It depends on when. In 1804, it took Lewis and Clark 18 months to get from Illinois to what is now the Washington/Oregon border. Add a month to start from New York, and a week to get down to northern California. At the time, it would have been faster to sail around South America, or down to Nicaragua or Panama, hike through the jungle to the Pacific, and get a ship to California. While the actual travel time of such a trip could have been less than three months, finding ships was chancy and the actual trip could take a year or more. Both these routes were dangerous and many people who attempted the journeys would never arrive. Over the next 50 years, railroads and steamships shortened the times, but the routes remained the same. For the 49\u2032ers (1849, of course) the sea journey took five to eight months while overland was two to four months. This shortened to six weeks by 1855 with the opening of a railway across Panama and improved ship service between New York/Panama and Panama/San Francisco. Overland transport by rail and stage coach would have taken about six weeks in the 1860s if not disrupted by either the Civil War or Indian wars. Then in 1869 the transcontinental railroad link reduced the journey to under a week for first-class express service. In 1876 an express made the journey in three and a half days, a record that would stand until the end of the century. ",
