            "answer_text": "Great question! Let's define some things first Communism: a political theory derived from Karl Marx, advocating class war and leading to a society in which all property is publicly owned and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs. Socialism: a political and economic theory of social organization that advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole. So there is a big difference between socialism and communism Communism is totally theoretical and utopian ideal of what the perfect economy/society would function like. A communist nation Would have no moneyEveryone would live in small communities each doing their job and contributing their efforts to the communistYou would just take what food and goods you needed from you fellow community members who are also workingThere would be no factories or mechanization. Everyone works by hand so they can feel pride in their work. If you make furniture you make the whole bed by hand and then give it to your neighbor. Then when you see them enjoying it you feel pride and you feel like you matter.There would be no real government. Communities would rule themselves in a democratic systemEveryone would be armed and there would be no police or militaryNow a communist nation would be weak- really weak. No military and government means they cannot protect themselves. Marx hoped the world would become communist so then it wouldn\u2019t matter. But until the revolution spread Marx advocated for socialism which was a stop-gap between capitalism and communism. Socialism was meant to transition a nation into communism and spread that socialist revolution to the world. So there has never been a communist nation. The \u201ccommunist\u201d in the Chinese Communist Party reflects the goal of the party- not the reality. So let\u2019s change the question to :How do people living in socialist regimes see Americans who are socialists and communists? That is a good question. Likely few of them care of even really know about American socialists. There really aren\u2019t that many American socialists. There are democratic socialists who are just more extreme liberals but are not real socialists.Most socialist nations HATE the USA and see the US as their arch-rival. Americans are stereotyped to be over-consuming, fat, dumb, and lazy. Likey many people do not know there are American socialists.If they did know there are American socialists they would still dislike them most likely. ",

            "answer_text": "People that live under a communist regime do not have access to \u201creal news\u201d from other countries as everything is controlled by the communist party. However, to the extent they are provided news about socialists and communists living in the United States they are told that those people are heroes fighting to bring liberty and justice to the US. Any action in which through legal means measures are taken in the US against anyone espousing those ideas utilizing violence or any other violation of the laws, are portrayed in their controlled press (which are the only one they have) as abuses by the US government regardless of how ridiculous it appears to us to believe this.

            "answer_text": "Blind idiots OR those who are in it for something other than the faux communal ideology that it is. There are two types of people, first those who are enlightened and understand that blind organs are products of royal elite propagandist that have studied Plato\u2019s, Trotsky\u2019s and others unpublished works. These works teach the science of how to manipulate large groups of people by way of propaganda and deeds of propaganda. The second kind of people are those who know nothing about the science of social manipulation and blind organs. These people are sheep and clay and once they are connected and committed to a blind organ they become iron, and useful idiots. The wolf plays most leadership roles but sometimes a sheep of iron can be blind enough to lead. ",
