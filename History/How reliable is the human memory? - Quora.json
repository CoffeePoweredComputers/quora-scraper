            "answer_text": "People tend to place greater faith in the accuracy, completeness and vividness of their memories than they probably should.....\"The brain's ability to store information about what we've experienced is of course truly impressive but our sense of a fluent and accurate back story is a clever cognitive illusion. Memory is essentially a reconstructive process and it is far more fallible than most people realise.;;; our brains just as they are in computers. Once registered, the data are put away for safe-keeping and eventual recall. The facts don\u2019t change. Psychologists have pointed out that we also suppress memories that are painful or damaging to self esteem We could say that, as a result, memory is unreliable. We could also say it is adaptive, reshaping itself to accommodate the new situations we find ourselves facing. Either way, we have to face the fact that it is \u201cflexible.\u201d  For most of us that usually means we recall a rosier past than we actually had, though some of us are tormented by memories of a painful past we can\u2019t shake and that seems to get worse every time we revisit them. But for all of us that means an incomplete past. Nothing brings this home better than the memories of witnesses in trials, one of the cornerstones of our legal system. All too many people have been put behind bars on the testimony of witnesses, who when challenged by more objective data have been later proved to be misremembering.These facts are sobering for those of us who tend to rely on our unreliable memories, whether we are investors trying to recall what experts have told us or just going about daily business, trying to learn from our own experience.  It makes sense to keep objective records of our decisions and our acts. (If we use our computers for that, we can usually count on their invariant memories.) But we usually feel it is too much trouble to record so much information, and we avoid the task. Much more pleasant and almost just as good is talking over our decisions with someone else. Indeed, if two or three or more people talk with each other regularly about their investment decisions\u2014or any decision for that matter\u2014they will not only help each other to recall their thinking more accurately, they will probably think better as well. There is always the danger of groupthink But if you encourage disagreements and challenges, you are not only likely to avoidconformity but get better results. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how you're evaluating it. In some ways, it's flawless, it can contain an incredible amount of information and in full detail. The 'problem' is that we can't consciously access the majority of it in the ways we typically use our memory. Part of the difficulty is that it's almost entirely associative. That's a key part of why we sometimes experience something with one of our senses or a combination that suddenly brings up something we might not have thought about in years. Smell is oddly one that can be extremely powerful for many aspects of recall. While association is a key part of how it all works, it's also a primary source of inaccuracies in everyday life. Our *conscious* attempts at recollection tend to be colored by *interpretation* that's using our current situation and state of mind to hold the 'crayons'. That's part of why hypnosis can often bring out details that might have seemed lost. Those details can be very helpful in some situations, but the vast majority of even the most 'qualified experts' employing it are like someone stealing your crayons so they can use their feet to draw a picture based on what you're describing, so under hypnosis you might use an adjective like 'big' and you're comparing a grasshopper to a flea, but they think you mean something bigger than a house. In other words, typical hypnotists are idiots, the best tend to be more into things like putting things/suggestions IN so they can help you, not so much with getting things out and examined or at least recorded. Even if they are recorded and you listen to them later, it's your conscious mind trying to interpret a vastly different 'language'. An ocean of perfectly clean water, but you can only use a filthy hand to access it and take a sip. As soon as the hand goes in, the reflection is disturbed. By the time it gets to your mouth, the reflection isn't on the water in your mouth anymore, and it's contaminated by whatever was on your hand. There are ways to gaze at its perfection, but that ocean is always moving and it's far too wide and deep to ever take it all in again. The only way to do that is to live exactly the same life all over again. The difficult part about even that is you can only ever be in one moment at a time, the present. ",
