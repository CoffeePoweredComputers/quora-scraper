He smoked two cigars a day, interspersed with a pipe and cigarettes. Harding also chewed, although he tapered off somewhat after entering the White House because of his wife's nagging. To many, chewing was a filthy habit, but not to Thomas Edison. Harding once shared a plug of tobacco with the famous inventor, causing Edison to remark, \"Harding's all right. Any man who chews tobacco is all right.\" http://www.presidentprofiles.com/Grant-Eisenhower/Warren-G-Harding-Presidential-appointments-and-style.html Franklin Delano Roosevelt  Lyndon Baines Johnson His health had been affected by years of heavy smoking, poor diet, and extreme stress; the former president had advanced coronary artery disease.
