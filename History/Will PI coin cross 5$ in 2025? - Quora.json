            "answer_text": "The Exact value of Pi (as on 24th Oct. 2020) is $0 (Pi Network Coin isn't in circulation as it is not yet listed on any crypto exchange). But After around 6 months of ICO(Initial Coin Offering), the value may be $0.014 to $0.333 (how?? :- All my estimations and supporting Calculations are in the end of this article) Currently the project is in 2nd phase (testnet: Blockchain is being developed and tested before decentralization). The Core team as of now is looking to launch in-app marketplace( PaypiMall) and some in-app transfer facility. As people will sell and buy using coins, the coin will get an intrinsic value. (Intrinsic value will solely depend on users participation and backing) Once the ICO( Initial Coin Offering) is held, people will invest in the project and the coin will get an extrinsic value. (Extrinsic value will depend on Demand and supply factors in the crypto market) So let's now try to estimate the value of 1 coin post ICO. (I'm using simplified formulae to get some range) Value of 1 Coin = Total Coin value( Market Cap)/Total Coins in circulation This formula doesn't consider many things that's why not so accurate but simple to understand. In case of Bitcoin, this formula has an error margin of 5\u201310% Let's look at how Bitcoin get it's value 1 BTC value = $ 200 B/ 14.52 M( total BTC in the market - lost BTCs) = $13.77 K The actual BTC value is $ 13 K (so we are 94% accurate ) So likewise, if we could know the total pi supply and it's market cap(estimate), we can find the worth of a single coin. Let's try to estimate that- Total active pi users( at the time of ICO): 10 MTotal successful KYCs( till ICO): 6M to 7M (suppose)(< 10M as Many users use dual phones, bots etc)Coin possessed by a user(avg): 5K to 10K ( as per one of poll on Telegram)Total Coin Supply= 6M* 5K to 7M*10K= 30 B to 70 BNow what should be the market cap(total coin value) after 2-3 months of ICO?? Let's take $1B- $10B (Don't worry; this will surely increase over time). (BTC has $200B of market Cap. This value built up in 12 years) Now let's put all these value in the formula- Value of One coin= total coins value/ total coins Minimum = $1B/ 70 B = $ 0.014 Maximum = $10B/ 30 B = $ 0.333 So, we can conclude that whatsoever would be the value of pi, it is not very convenient to consider it more than a dollar, not even half a dollar. It's actually one third or less than that. It could be as low as $0.001 but not more than $0.333 in any case. But the value will increase over time for sure. Till 2025, it may touch $5 or more. So, Keep Mining. If you are not a pi member, join the revolution now. You don't have to invest anything to start with and have to open the app once in a day and tap on bolt icon. Neither the app asks any storage access permissions nor does it drain your battery. Use my invitation Code- Shiv2022 Thank You ",

            "answer_text": "It is very possible that it reaches 5 doller until 2025 and maybe even more than that. It can trace the growth of bitcoin too and may even go beyond. Reason being, creators want every person to hold pi and almost everyone on the planet has a mobile phone, at least in urban settings. Right now nearly 8\u201310 million people have started mining but the actual pi network will go to 100 million in coming years. I believe more people more will be the value. Pi is going to get costly. And it's better to start mining from now itself. So guys what are u waiting for? My referral code is: VarunPandey1998 Start mining. All you need is a mobile phone and a few seconds of you day every 24 hours. ",
