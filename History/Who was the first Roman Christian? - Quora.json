And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour. Matthew 8 ",

That which mentions a person by name and is dated reliably: the earliest will be our answer. Does anyone know? I mean, anyone. I see other answers, so let\u2019s have it then: show us the artefact. That will not be a problem to anyone who knows. Where is it? What is it? Come on now, you experts - tell us! Let\u2019s see where lies the intellectual integrity here. Hint: it will not be anything claimed as Early Christian, because none mention an explicit Christ, or Christian. You knew that, of course, because you\u2019ve read my other answers on this, haven\u2019t you? Archaeology of Religion",
