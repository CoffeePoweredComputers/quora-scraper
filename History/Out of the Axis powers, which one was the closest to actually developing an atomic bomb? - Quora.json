Looking into state files the Germans had made some progress into nuclear research but had struggled to make a fully functioning reactor before the end of the war. They had made more progress into it than previously thought but were provably still a few years away from being able to produce the enriched uranium and/or plutonium fizzle material. No other axis power was even looking into nuclear as far as I'm aware. ",
