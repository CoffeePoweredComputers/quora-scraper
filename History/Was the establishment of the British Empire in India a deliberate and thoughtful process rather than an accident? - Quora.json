            "answer_text": "Of course it is a deliberate process. In the 16th and 17th century, the West European countries namely France, England,Dutch,Portugese, Italians etc discovered unknown lands and navigators were being encouraged to pursue aggressively on expansion and colonialist policy. Far East has always been a mystical place for the Europeans since Marco Polo's visits. With Spain and Portuguese capturing the South Americas. British wanted more lands somewhere else. Meanwhile Dutch have been very successful in colonializing the East Indies, trading spices and gaining wealth as spices are very much in demand in Europe. India has always been the hunting and looting for all invaders since Alexander the Great. So, India was a easy target. A massive country with no unity among the kingdoms. Which obviously anyone would took advantage of anyway. I would say its a failure on part of the Indian Kings, who couldn't throw off their ego to unite against those hostile invaders. Instead some were lap dogs, while others we're betrayed. And that's how British came to India, played war and politics and finally after Battle of Plassey and Buxar. British emerged as a force to reckon with. Thanks to invasion by Nadir Shah and Marathas, the Mughal Empire was weakened and so was relatively easy when a great empire is crumbled from within. British being cunning foxes feasted on the carcass of once great Mughal Empire. ",
