            "answer_text": "This question will bring out the my country does this better than the USA because.... Every nation is different. They are at different stages of development, they have different groups of people and they have different views on running things. The USA has some good features to copy Now to be fair many countries do copy their laws on the USA. For example Australia gave equal representation to it's States in their Senate, or it's Presidential/Congressional system of Government. Many foreigners will travel to the USA and learn about systems of government and management and implement them. When Japan decided to throw of isolationism and embrace the world, they send people to study the different ways of governing. But Secondly as Winston Churchill said, the US can be counted on to do the right thing after they have tried everything else. There are some atrocious things going on in the USA. Why would my country (New Zealand) want to try them out? HealthcareYou spend about 17% of your GDP on Healthcare, only cover some of the population, while we cover the whole population at 10% of GDP spending. Your death panels (insurance companies) produce profit for insurance companies. Our death panels produce profit for the healthcare system which can be invested in more healthcare spending elsewhere. Single level of GovernmentMy country is a unitary state. We have one central government. We have one police force unlike the USA with multiple forces. We have one court system rather than state and federal levels. Parliamentary GovernmentOur election season takes a few months every 3 years. We have one house of Parliament. Our Prime Minister has to keep Parliament happy or he loses his job - right away. Fair ElectionsBush did not win a majority of votes. But he still won. If you are a third party candidate or party you may get a major amount of votes - say 20% and yet get only one or two seats in the legislature. To be fair our system used to be like this but was changed to proportional representation in 1996. GunsWe have gun control. Yet the USA does not. The USA gives people the right to own a gun by constitutional amendment. I don't need to own a gun to defend myself. If I want to own a gun I have to jump through a lot of hoops to get one. LawyersCan you Americans stop suing each other?. If I have an accident a no fault insurance scheme will pay the bill. And we don't allow software patents to allow innovation and prevent software trolls. Patent trolls getting worse No time limits on Unemployment insurance If I lost my job and could never find another one, I would be able to get welfare for ever. Now if I stayed on it a long time the government would start hasseling me and put me on courses, but so long as I was looking for a job, I have it for ever (Till the pension). Now that said, I do feel that Australia does it better, they have work for the Dole (welfare). But this is socialist! Well the majority of people in New Zealand like a good bit of socialism. They like knowing the poor will have somewhere to live. They like Universal healthcare. We are a democracy. We chose to have these systems in our nation. America has chosen a different way to run it's country. And I wish you well. Feel free to steal ideas from US as we steal ideas from you. The founder of Walmart would visit competitors stores to steal ideas from them to make his operation better. ",

            "answer_text": "Because in most cases, the people are those who shape the laws, not the other way round. If you give a nation a set of laws that it doesn't find to be fitting, they will either ignore them, change them or not enforce them. Laws and constitutions create a sort of \"ideal framework\" for a state, but the reality will usually diverge. Three examples:1. Both Russia and France are semi-presidential republics, governed by popularly elected presidents. The French constitution gives the president a lot more power than the Russian one, yet every political analyst will conclude that Vladimir Putin is a lot more powerful than Francois Hollande. 2. Both the UK and Saudi Arabia are, at least in theory, absolute theocratic monarchies. The UK is governed by the Queen, who derives her authority from God, in her position of Head of The Church of England. It just so happens that she willingly gives the lawmaking power to an elected Parliament and never refuses to sign bills into laws, when said Parliament gently asks her. She also entrusts a government to take care of running the countryAccording to the Saudi Basic Law, \"Government in Saudi Arabia derives power from the Holy Qu'ran and the Prophet's tradition.\"(Ch. 2, art. 7). The King rules(mostly) unopposed, by royal decree.It can clearly be seen that two similar sets of laws can lead to very different countries, a democratic one that values human rights and a repressive, xenophobic one.3. After the overthrow of the Communist government in 1989, Romania had to come up with a new constitution. The committee that drafted the constitution copied large chunks from the French one, since both historically and in recent years, France was seen as a \"big sister\", a good model to emulate. However, the two countries have different people, different social problems and different historical baggage. So it's no wonder that Romania found it hard to govern and there's currently a debate about changing the constitution.  There are some instances when it did work( Japan's Meji Constitution, inspired by Prussia's, Ataturk's reforms that drew heavily from the French constitution and the Italian Civil Code). But these examples are rather rare and mostly happened because the people chose laws that were \"fit\" for them. ",
