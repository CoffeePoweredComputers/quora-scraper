            "answer_text": "I live near Milwaukee, which is known for three things: cheese, beer, and being the most segregated city in the US.  Here\u2019s a map of Milwaukee by race, according to the 2010 census. The green represents African-Americans, the blue represents whites, the red represents Asians and the orange represents Hispanics. It\u2019s pretty much absolute. There are a couple of reasons for this segregation. Housing Laws For a long time, non-white families could not buy houses in the suburbs. It was literally illegal. So these groups kind of came to be. And then people stayed where they were. White Flight During the Great Migration, many African-American families moved north, and into the cities where there were lots of jobs. At the same time, the suburbs were expanding, and white families could afford to move there and build houses, because of how good WW2 was for the American economy. Economics of Race Here\u2019s the thing. The median income for white people is higher than the median income for African-Americans. Houses in the suburbs are more expensive. It is simply more affordable to live in the city. How Humans Work People like to be around people who look like them. I\u2019m not saying this segregation is right, it isn\u2019t. But in New York, for example, when people were immigrating in the early 1900s, Jewish neighborhoods formed. And Polish neighborhoods, and Russian neighborhoods, and so on. A variety of economic and social factors have lead to the segregation we see today. ",

            "answer_text": "People do move to where they are most comfortable, when there is the freedom to do so. Waves of immigrants often settle where housing is cheapest, and then others from their home region settle near them as a matter of convenience - why live where you have to travel far to get the goods you want from \u201cthe old country\u201d when you can just live in the neighborhood that has it all? However, you cannot escape the legal imposition of segregation on cities, and expect its effects to simply disappear. This book: Some of My Best Friends Are Black: The Strange Story of Integration in America: Tanner Colby: 9780143123637: Amazon.com: Books discusses the ways in which restrictive covenants were written into subdivision rules to make it illegal to sell a house to a black or Jewish person unless the bylaws of the subdivision were changed by a majority of existing owners. In this article, The Case for Reparations, the author describes how banks, insurance companies and white homeowners absolutely connived to ensure that only white people could live in certain areas, via loan policies, and violent action against those who tried to go against the trend. Some of America\u2019s segregation is the organic result of immigrants choosing to band together. Some of it is the relic of historical forces that kept people of color out of many areas. ",
