            "answer_text": "Mariam-uz-zamani was the title of emperor Jahangir\u2019s mother. She was most probably a portuguese cocubine of emperor Akbar. She had no importance in the court politics during Akbar\u2019s era, neither did she had any say in the family affairs of the royal mughal family be it during Salim\u2019s rebellion or khusrao\u2019s. It was Salima and hamida who played their role in bringing peace betwern Salim and Akbar. Ruqaiya Sultana and Salima Sultana were responsible for Jahangir\u2019s corronation as the mughal emperor after Akbar. While it was Salima Sultana And Ruqaiya Sultana who seeked pardon for the life of Akbar\u2019s foster brother mirza Aziz koka from Jahangir after he supported Prince khusrao in the war of succession. Ruqaiya Sultana and Hamida bano requested Akbar for the life of a Sunni Muslim whi killed a Shia Muslim purely out of religious animity. For all of these incidences we can safely say that mariam-uz-zamani had no say in the mughal royal family. However she gained some importance as queen mother after Jahangir\u2019s accession to the throne and was invloved in some trade also.While she remained totally cut off from the family matters. She was mostly invloved in collecting money through trade during Jahangir\u2019s reign. While just like all other mughal princes Jahangir respected his mother. ",
