            "answer_text": "No, although the decision by Rwanda to do so in 2008 has given the impression that they all are, despite Rwanda\u2019s circumstances being very different. The push towards English was led by Tutsi people who had returned from exile in Uganda where they had grown up speaking English, including Paul Kagame, the President, who had been a military officer there. Although the decision to adopt English was portrayed as a pragmatic decision to strengthen Rwanda\u2019s ties with its English-speaking neighbours and the wider world, there were other more ulterior motives at play. It was also a way for the Tutsis to \u2018get square\u2019 with the rival Hutus, who had become the French-speaking elite since independence and were seen as responsible for the 1994 genocide, in which Tutsis were targeted. France saw the Hutus as key to its influence in Rwanda and the surrounding region, and was seen as complicit in the genocide by the Tutsi-led government that took power, which was dominated by English speakers. Ironically, before independence, the Tutsis were the French-speaking elite in Rwanda, with the Hutus having a second-class status, until they took power in the 1959 Revolution, which caused many Tutsis to flee into exile. By contrast, Burundi, which is culturally, linguistically and historically similar to Rwanda, has not moved away from French to English in education or administration, despite having also made English an official language in 2014. Neither Rwanda or Burundi were originally French colonies, having initially part of German East Africa until they were occupied by Belgium in 1916, which governed them as the territory of Ruanda-Urundi until independence.

            "answer_text": "Not really! French-speaking African countries are very close to France and most of the French-speaking African people admire the French culture a lot! The majority of French-speaking African students go to France to study abroad i/o the US. French-speaking African diaspora tend also to be spread in France, mainly. Rwanda completely switched to English from French due to the genocide, as according to Rwandan government the French government supported the genocide there. In Madagascar, English was also added as official language with French from 2002 to 2009 because the president at that time was pro-American. To sum it up, due to close ties between France & French-speaking Africa, switching to English will take at least decades or even centuries! At my personal level, I speak fluently English but for me English is just a tool to communicate with the world and an asset for work. However, I\u2019m culturally very close to France and I even read Shakespeare and watch American movies in French!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Tl;dr: Yes; but only partially, and slowly Rwanda is the obvious example. I have worked there, and it now increasingly rare to find fluent French-speakers. Everyone speaks Kinyarwanda and English. Congo Kinshasa is also tending towards English, and the leaders of countries like Togo and Senegal are increasingly using English in their public discourses - particularly for international audiences. But others, such as Cameroons, are repressing the use of English, in favour of French. In any case, it will take decades [if not generations] for English to spread to the majority. ",
