            "answer_text": "Look up a movement called filibusters. These are private American invasion forces or mercenaries that tried to take over nations to make them part of the US. The long list of them includes- Canada 1797, 1837, 1838, 1839-1841 Texas 1800, 1801, 1813, 1819, 1825, 1835 Venezuela 1806 Tristan de Cunha 1810 Spanish Florida 1812                Yucatan, Mexico 1844 California, Mexico (\u201cBear Flag Republic\u201d) 1845Spanish Cuba 1848, 1849, 1850, 1851 Nicaragua 1855 Costa Rica 1856    Sonora, Mexico 1857 Honduras 1860  As you can see, for Texas and California the invaders eventually succeeded. Given the right conditions, these other nations could have been taken by force and  become part of the US just as TX and CA were. There was also a Dominican president who offered to sell part of his nation to the US. US Grant considered the idea, but it was turned down by Congress. A territory with mostly Black people was too controversial in the middle of Reconstruction. There was an effort for a state called Franklin in what is now east Tennessee that was rejected. Had it been accepted, the state would have been a Union outpost in the middle of the Confederacy. Most people in east Tennessee were small farmers and strongly opposed to the CSA. There were proposals when Texas was taken from Mexico to split it into as many as five states. The territory the insurgents claimed was utterly ridiculous. They claimed Texas even included parts of what are now Wyoming, almost 1000 miles beyond their control. The Nueces strip between the Rio Grande and Nueces River never was under insurgent control.  One proposal would have split off the southern and western half of the territory. It would have made more sense, since the region is very different culturally, but it was turned down. Then the El Paso region wanted to become part of New Mexico Territory. They feared the same land loss and racist violence already happening in south Texas. Texas's governor even sent a military expedition to threaten New Mexico. The federal govt intervened and Texas lost most of its claimed territory. New Mexico doubled in size. But El Paso was forced to be part of Texas. When a foolish Texas secession petitions on the White House website was filed a couple years ago, El Paso residents started their own counter petition asking to secede >from< Texas should Texas actually ever secede.

            "answer_text": "This answer is probably out of place, but I can't stop thinking about the McLane-Ocampo treaty where mexican president Benito Ju\u00e1rez practically conceded a whole bunch of Mexican territory to the United States. This treaty was not accepted by the USA senate due to the prevalent animosity between the north and the south.  In December 1860, the McLane-Ocampo Treaty with Mexico quietly expired when the United States Senate failed to reconsider its previous rejection of the treaty. By most accounts, the treaty\u2014with its establishment of free trade and the granting of transit rights across the isthmus of Tehuantepec for a scant $4 million\u2014favored the United States. Moreover, it represented President James Buchanan's final effort to propel American expansion into Mexican territory. Given the instability of the Mexican government and the language of the treaty, it was likely the United States could convert a temporary presence into an eventual conquest. Nonetheless, the Senate rejected the treaty on May 31, 1860, by a vote of twenty-seven to eighteen. A motion to reconsider the vote placed it on the December agenda, but by then the fragmenting Union ill-afforded the Senate the luxury of unfinished business.

Supporters also include Filipinos that had fought as members of the United States Armed Forces in various wars during theCommonwealth period.[40][41]\nThe Philippine statehood movement had a significant impact during the earlyAmerican colonial period;[38] It is no longer a mainstream movement,[42] but is a small social movement that gains interest and talk in that nation.[43][44] See also: What would it be like if the Philippines was a state of the United States? While already acquired by the United States, New Mexico applied for statehood in 1850, encouraged by the North who wanted to lock slavery out of the Southwest, then was not admitted until 1912, a month before Arizona which was last of the lower 48. This must be the record wait in organized territory status before statehood. ",

The only occasion I can remember when a foreign nation petitioned to join the USA was Texas, and we accepted them. Does an Indian Nation count? The last speck of Indian Territory, which constituted the eastern half of modern Oklahoma, petitioned for statehood as the State of Sequoyah and was rejected. Personally, I think it's a shame it wasn't accepted. Update: The question says \"states\" now as well as \"nations.\" Is it asking for the names of failed proposals for US states like Jefferson, Deseret, and Absaroka? ",
