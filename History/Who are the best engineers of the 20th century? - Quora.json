            "answer_text": "It's tough to decide.  The 20th century was dominated by large scale manufacturing, so my bias is towards advances in manufacturing.  Very few 20th century inventions had major impacts unless they were produced at low cost and ion a large scale.  My nominees are: Henry Ford, who perfected the assembly line and the way so many things are produced today:    Alastair Pilkington, who perfected the float glass technique (casting glass on a river of molten tin instead of on a solid mold) to make inexpensive and high quality glass for windows and other uses:   Masaru Ibuka, who co-founded Sony and who made the first hugely successful product with transistors, the TR-63 coatpocket transistor radio. Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce, who figured out how to put multiple transistors on a single piece of silicon, ushering in the age of the integrated circuit:   I'm actually not a big fan of most 20th century software engineering, which is why there are no software engineers on my list.

            "answer_text": "David Lewinnek's answer includes those engineers that most profoundly influenced the way we live today and I'd recommend reading his answer. Possible best engineer of the 20th century, and responsible for the coolest planes, is Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson, leader of Lockheed Skunk Works, and designer of the SR-71 Blackbird.  Johnson was known as a brilliant manager, able to market his ideas effectively, in addition to his talent at airplane design. Johnson's wikipedia page gives a full list of the aircraft Johnson was involved with, including the P-38 Lightning:  The U-2 spy plane (in use since 1955):  and the F-117A Nighthawk (the first stealth aircraft):     ",
