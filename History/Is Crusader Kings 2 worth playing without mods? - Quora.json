            "answer_text": "It took me two years to even consider playing another game after I found CK2. It was early on, I started with 1.04. I never played mods much, AGOT mod started running slowly after they introduced Essos, I may try it once my old computer dies and is replaced by something newer. I never bothered with any of the others. So yes, absolutely. CK2 writes a new chapter in strategy gaming, to the best of my knowledge it\u2019s the first strategy game ever to focus on internal struggles of a nation. Many featured it, but internal politics are front and center of the CK2, alongside character building so extensive it\u2019s as much a strategy game as it is an RPG. I guess it can be a bit overwhelming at first, maybe try it with DLCs for the initial couple of hours, even if you have them. That\u2019ll flatten out the learning curve somewhat. After you\u2019re confident you know what you\u2019re doing go all in. Mods are nice, but CK2 doesn\u2019t need them. ",
