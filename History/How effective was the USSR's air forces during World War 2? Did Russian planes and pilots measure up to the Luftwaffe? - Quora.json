            "answer_text": "According to Finnish Air Force veterans, not very effective. Their collective opinion tends to be that the Soviets tried to put up as great numbers in the air as they could with little attention on pilot training, logistics or tactics. They had good aeroplanes but they did not know how to get the best out of them. Ilmari Juutilainen (94 kills) said one on one as pilots the Finns were superior, and pilots flying planes like Brewster F2A, Curtiss P-36 or Morane-Saulnier 406 could still gain victories in 1944. Juutilainen also stated that \u201cone or two on one would be a certain kill, and attacking a formation of 100+ planes would provide immediate chances for multiple kills; but most difficult would be fighting solo against five or six Soviets, as you could not see them simultaneously\u201d. The FinnAF pilots noted that the Soviets did have excellent and skilled pilots, but they were few and far between. In average, their skills and quality was poor. Their tactics were rigid and rudimentary, and the average pilot was inexperienced and could barely master his plane but not fight. Juutilainen stated he felt sad for those Russian boys he had to shoot: they were too inexperienced to put up fight. The common Finnish opinion on Soviet planes was that they were pleasant to fly but terrible to upkeep and maintain in flying condition. Many war booty planes were considered as \u201cfault simulators\u201d. Soviets preferred not to harmonize their guns, but keep them shooting parallel, creating a \u201cshotgun\u201d like effect. This would help unskilled pilots to gain hits, but a skilled pilot would just waste his ammunition. The result was that the Finns scored almost just astronomically as the Germans, albeit on inferior aeroplanes. The Finns considered Bf 109G to be superior to anything the Soviets could put in the air. The Finns considered the Lend-Lease P-39 Airacobra as the most dangerous opponent: they were assigned to elite units and seasoned pilots, who could use their assets to the maximum, and who would use the 37 mm gun with devastating results. (Then again, the second and third highest Soviet fighter pilots, Aleksandr Pokryshkin and Grigori Retchkalov, scored 59 and 58 kills with Airacobra respectively.) The Finns considered the Soviet long range bomber corps, ADD, as incompetent terror pilots who preferred to bomb civilian targets. They tended to suffer heavily, and were easy prey to radar-controlled anti-aircraft gunnery and FinnAF pilots. The ground attack forces were respected: the Il-2 Shturmovik was nicknamed Maatalouskone (\u201cAgricultural Machine\u201d or \u201cCrop Duster\u201d) as it was both a continuous nuisance and extremely difficult to shoot down.

            "answer_text": "How does one judge effectiveness? Does being on the winning side in a world war count? Does having the more sophisticated engineering count? Better tactics, doctrine, and pilot experience? Whatever the Soviet Air Force had, it was enough to win the war, which is good enough by most accounts. The Luftwaffe was clearly the superior force at the beginning of the war and swept the skies of Soviet craft. By the end of the war, the tables had turned and material shortcomings kept the Luftwaffe largely grounded to minimal effectiveness and activity. The Soviets dominated the skies at that point. Early war German aeronautical engineering was clearly superior. It pretty hard to find a way that the Luftwaffe lacked compared to the Soviets. The Soviets were simply outclassed. By the end of the war, whatever lack of sophistication some Russian aircraft may have lacked was more than overcome by the quality of quantity. Ground attack aircraft like the Sturmovik were brutally effective and even served after the war for some years. German jets weren't enough. Captured German technology became the first MiG's. German tactics and pilot experience were probably superior throughout most of the war, but clearly still weren't enough. By the end of the war, Luftwaffe casualties had suffered the loss of much of their experience forcing green pilots and Hitler Youth into the cockpit. At that point, Soviet survivors might have had greater collective skill and experience compared to the remaining German aces and veterans. A vast majority of German aces had much higher kill numbers, but those are just numbers. Some of the aces scored heavily in prewar turket shoots such as the Spanish Civil War. This doesn't discount their skills in anyway. The German Blitzkrieg was great on the offense, but lacked on defense. Dive bombers were much less effective by the war's end, especially the Stuka. In summation, the Luftwaffe was probably the superior air force in almost every way throughout much of the war except the one that counts most: winning. ",
