            "answer_text": "As others have pointed out, your statement is considerably too strong. The British did, to some extent, mix with the natives, and the Spanish mixing was limited in extent. But the difference is mainly in the attitudes of the two parties. Spain saw the Americas as a source of wealth. They went there to get resources, particularly gold, and then return hims wealthy. So they were quite happy to live in local communities while they were there - temporarily as they thought, and take local mistresses/wives. They regarded the local populations as a resource to be exploited. Whereas the British saw North America as basically an unprofitable wilderness, and the people who went there were settlers trying to create new communities away from the oppression of the British state. They arrived as communities in what they saw (incorrectly) as an empty continent, intending to create new permanent settlements. The early settlers arrived as communities before they ever landed, intending to take and keep the land separate from any locals. They regarded local populations as a nuisance to be excluded. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is interesting because it brings out a common misconception. There is certainly some truth to the fact that, after some murderous acts early in their colonization, the Spaniards tended to be more accepting of their native subjects than the British. One part of this was that the population of South and Central America was quite a bit higher than North America. The other part is that the Spanish originally launched mainly military expeditions with few women so there was much more mixing with the natives early on compared to the British. Nevertheless, the notion that there was not much mixing in North America is false. Mixing was quite prevalent. We tend to want to think that every mixed heritage person must have stayed with the native tribes but in fact most eventually ended up in \u201cwhite\" society. In fact, in the early days American society was much more accepting of this than in later years. I remember reading a history text about Minnesota that discussed how native and mixed peoples were allowed to vote in elections as long as they wore pants (as opposed to native dress). If you do a DNA test on Americans today you might be surprised at the amount of native ancestry. ",
