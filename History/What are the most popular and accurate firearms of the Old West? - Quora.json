            "answer_text": "Accuracy is a combination of the shooter\u2019s eyesight, health, breath control, experience, stress level at the moment, understanding of the particular gun\u2019s quirks, and intuitive/rational knowledge of how bullets travel over distance and through wind, humidity, etc. PLUS how well the barrel was made and heat treated, the way the rifling lands and grooves were cut into the barrel, how well the chamber contains the pressures of the black powder\u2019s gasses to put the most propelling power behind the bullet, how the bullet enters the rifling grooves at the throat of the barrel and leaves it at the barrel\u2019s end, how vibration\u2019s handled from the gas pressure and shooter\u2019s own hands, and how useful the iron sights are on that particular gun (installation mistakes or later damage were common, telescopic sights were available but delicate, costly, and rare.) So on long guns, and the longer the barrel so 28\u201334\u2033 long the better as the gas pressure has more space and time to work in propelling the bullet at a higher velocity: British Whitworth 1874 Sharps 1875 Sharps Borchardt Remington-Ryder Rolling Blocks Ballard 1853, 1860, 1872 Sharps Stevens Davenport/Hopkins & Allen falling block Springfield 1866, 1873, 1884 trapdoors and by the 1880\u2019s-1890\u2019s as smokeless powder became available, barrel and action metallurgy greatly improved, precision assembly methods and screws improved, more adjustable sights, better ergonomics in gunstock shapes, etc. 1885 Browning Winchester High Wall & Low Wall German Mauser bolt actions Swiss Vetterelli bolt actions Austrian Mannlicher bolt actions British Lee-Metford/Lee-Enfield bolt actions Danish Krag-Jorgenson bolt actions Savage 1892\u20139 lever action Winchester 1892, 1894, 1895 lever actions by Browning Handguns Contemporary tests and accounts are all over the place and the best shots/most active users of these were constantly adopting different makes, models, actions, calibers, barrel lengths, etc. so it\u2019s far less clear than an 1873 Colt .45 Single Action Army model with a 4.75\u2033 barrel (movies) or 7.5\u2033 barrel (the more common choice and much easier to shoot, I shoot both.) There are expert fans back then of the Colt 1851 Navy, the Colt 1860 Army, Colt 1866\u20131872 cartridge conversions of the 1860, Colt 1877 and 1878 Double Actions, and Colt 1889\u20131892 Navy & Army double action .38\u2019s. But the Smith & Wesson No\u2019s 1, 2, & 3 models, Schofield, American, Russian revolvers outsold the Colts internationally by a wide margin for experienced cavalry troops and officers for the same or higher price than the Colts. Merwin Hulbert & Co./Hopkins & Allen revolvers were the third most popular worldwide and had higher pressures, many advanced features, and the widest range of models with considerable influence on revolver design, I think they point better than the Smith and as well as the Colt. Remington\u2019s 1858 and 1875 Army revolvers had many fans, particularly during the Civil War when they were as common as Colts and often preferred. There are other makes in the Old West who earned fans and had thousands or more revolvers in use such as Starr (3rd most popular Civil War revolver for Union troops, early double action), British Adams and Webley revolvers, the pocket revolvers of most manufacturers, Forehand & Wadsworth revolvers, Allen & Thurber pepperboxes, derringers, 1849 Colt Pocket Pistol which was among the very most popular of the whole century, and others. John Walter\u2019s book, \u201cGuns That Won the West\u201d is by far the most comprehensive. I\u2019ve seen all of them, own some of them, have shot a few rounds to a few hundred rounds through some, and talked with many gunsmiths (always especially informative) about them up through Bob Munden, David Chicoine, etc.) along with thousands of pages read. I\u2019m reading \u201cThe Peacemaker\u201d by John Parsons who used mostly original sources like Army Ordnance evaluations and that\u2019s again changing my mind on many topics with better facts. There\u2019s an enormous amount on this topic based on looking at a few museum examples and extrapolating the world from those, missing much of what was out there in constant use by experts who could pick anything.
