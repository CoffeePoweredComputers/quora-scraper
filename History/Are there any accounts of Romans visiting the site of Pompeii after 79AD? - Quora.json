            "answer_text": "Your question reminds me that despite the apparent thoroughness of our knowledge of the culture and history of ancient Rome, there are significant gaps. As others have mentioned, the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D. buried Pompeii under at least 15 feet of ash and pumice.  A measure of the traumatic nature of the event is that it was in 106 or 107 A.D. (more than 25 years afterwards) that Pliny the Younger gave the historian Tacitus his account.  It's worth reading the letters in their entirety to get a feeling for just how detailed and emotionally evocative they are, despite the lessons in stoicism Pliny received from the  uncle he lionizes in his narrative: http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/pompeii/PlinyLetters.htm Pliny the Younger describes the confusion and uncertainty even those across the bay from Vesuvius felt undergoing the eruption, which lasted more than 24 hours.  Those of us who've lived through similar events at close hand (Katrina, 9/11, Damascus, for example) can attest to the accuracy of his description. At the time of the eruption in 79 A.D., Pompeii and Herculaneum were still undergoing repairs from the earthquake that had occurred in 63 A.D.  The region around Vesuvius was important as a port and as a fashionable country retreat for wealthy Roman families, but the Romans had been there only about 100 years.  Although there were great economic incentives to rebuild, the Romans rightly saw the unprecedented (so far as they knew - scientists believe that the previous such event occurred around 1800 B.C.) volcanic event as fundamentally different than the earthquakes with which they were familiar. But, just because there are no accounts of post-eruption visits to Pompeii does not mean they did not occur.  In fact, there is plenty of archaeological evidence that after the eruption, both owners and looters recovered the valuables they could from the rich villas of Pompeii and Herculaneum.  We don't know how long the looting took place between the eruption and the beginning of  Charles Bourbon's more efficient exploration and looting beginning in 1748. Other cultures took a different approach to geological problems created by pyroclastic flows like the ones that affected Pompeii: Derinkuyu underground city ",

            "answer_text": "Well in short, there haven't been modern evidence of Romans revisiting the site. In my opinion though, the Romans most likely didn't. Romans were a superstitious lot (they even thought that an enlarged penis of Priapus, the ancient god of sex and fertility, could ward off evil omens.. go figure). In the aftermath of such a catastrophic event where NOT JUST the city got annihilated, the surrounding countryside also saw significant damage. Reportedly, people as far away as Misenum fled for their lives.   No sane roman would even attempt to visit, to loot or even check for survivors as only those that escaped by ship were already rescued. The air would also mostly be filled with ash from the eruption and the thick smoke would have lent an ominous atmosphere to any visitor. An observer, Pliny the Younger wrote an account of the eruption: Broad sheets of flame were lighting up many parts of Vesuvius; their light and brightness were the more vivid for the darkness of the night... it was daylight now elsewhere in the world, but there the darkness was darker and thicker than any night. Who in the right mind could even come as close to Pompeii just to choke on ashes and see this being formed?!   ",
