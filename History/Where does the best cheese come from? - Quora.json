            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been around, and from what I can see, it seems that europe is a land of cheese and wine. One can find a good cheese all over the continent. Some of the more famous ones: Feta in greece and similar salty cheeses in Macedonia (\u201cBelo Sirenje\u201d), Bulgaria, south Serbia..Halloumi - the only cheese that I know of that can be grilled like a piece of meat.Gorgonzola, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Mozzarella di Bufalo, Provolone, etc - there are dosens of really good cheese types in italy (see List of Italian cheeses)Pag cheese in Croatia, Livno cheese in Bosnia, Kashkaval in Serbia, Bulgaria & Macedonia..Famous Edamer & Gouda from Netherlands (see also List of Dutch cheeses)Emmentaler and 400+ other types in Swizerland (see List of Swiss cheeses)And so on. Every european country has a couple of really good cheese types and the cheese is omnipresent all over the continent. Some are common all over the place, like Feta or Emmentaler. Other are more peculiar, like the Steirerk\u00e4se \u2013 Wikipedia (there are worse things, but this one is already not something to be taken lightly). However, among all these places there is one country that is the real kingdom of cheese and wine: France. It\u2019s not just that french produce huge number of cheese types that really differ in look and taste (List of French cheeses). It\u2019s not just the enormous quantity of wine & cheese that they produce either. What makes France into a wine & cheese world champion is that they are essential part of the french cultural identity. If you ever get a chance to visit a Foire aux Fromages et aux Vins | Ville d'Antony (or similar in other places), by all means do. I have learned more about french way of life there than anywhere else. :-) Update: what just occurred to me is that by the cheese index, Turkey is definitely an European country. Plenty of good cheese there. ",

            "answer_text": "The best cheeses all come from one place: an udder. That's right, whether it be a cheddar cheese made from cow's milk, a mozzarella made from buffalo milk, a creamy goat's milk spread, or a salty and sharp sheep's milk Romano, the best cheeses are based on the milk of ruminants. Now, there are some imitators out there, made from plant milks like coconut or almond milk, but these have never tasted as good as the real deal to warrant a look, unless you were concientious in your motivations to go animal free. The only even slightly contender, which some might argue is a cheese, since it is a form of congealed soy milk, which is pressed to remove water, is tofu. Tofu serves a niche market, as the type of \u201ccheese\u201d served in many Asian dishes. It does well, but is fairly flavorless, so does not do very well without outside flavor help.(And, yes, I know there is a flavorful, \u201cstinky\u201d variety of tofu, but let's save that for a future discussion, as tofu is such a friend cheese to begin with) ",

France has long been hailed as the home of great traditional cheeses. However, in recent years there has been a huge growth in innovation with and appreciation of artisanal cheese making. The French appellation system and that of some other countries has in many ways stifled this creativity, allowing other nations to become greater innovators. On a purely personal level, the current small artisanal cheese makers of Ireland represent the most exciting place right now. Try some and enjoy. ",
