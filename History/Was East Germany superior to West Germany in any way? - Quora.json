            "answer_text": "Theoretically they were in many ways. But then those ways evaporate under scrutiny. Examples: Lower crime rates. But considering that entire country was run very much like a prison, with an estimation that every 3rd person was involved in secret surveillance, lower crime rates could be the natural result. Also much of the crime statistics were supressed during the Honecker regime, according to the motto: What cannot be, doesn\u2019t exist.100% employment. Everyone had a job, even if they did nothing all day long. If success is measured by the employment rate and not the rate of production, well then they \u201cdid it better\u201d.No poverty. But \u201cno poverty\u201d was something that can be viewed relatively. When approximately 90% of the country had only their basic needs covered (while the other 10% had their needs covered in a most unsocialistic manner), and homelessness was technically illegal, then one can artificially prevent poverty. Of course, covering their basic needs was secretly financed by West Germany. The reason why East Germany eventually failed was not because they \u201cgave up\u201d, but because they went bankrupt.Free education. But then education was also free in West Germany during the same time.Community involvement. Since belonging to the community was inescapable, the level of integrating citizens into community activism reached an all-time high in all age groups - but then again - it was compulsorary. Whether it was scouting (FDJ), state childcare, state elderly care, municipal committees, and political (SED Party) support, there was much more activitity than could have ever been acheived in the West, bucause saying \u201cOh, screw this stuff!\u201d was not an option.",

            "answer_text": "The green arrows.  They help traffic, but drivers from West Germany aren\u2019t capable of dealing with them accident free. The arrows had their time in the early 1990s. Authorities in the West tried to establish them, they failed. Roundabouts are a similar phenomenon in Germany. They are built, at least, but German drivers need clear, distinct signs, traffic lights without arrows ideally, to handle unfamiliar obstacles like roads in circles. In front of a roundabout the majority of German drivers won\u2019t appreciate the help, they see a barrier. For others it feels wrong being stopped by a red light. I assume that the arrow is still present in East Germany. Probably they have less traffic lights at roundabouts, too. Sex comes to mind. The GDR in 1988/89 was a paradise for schoolboys from the West. Twice I went there to study German history and literature. We had learned about Goethe and Weimar, the sexual openness hit us unprepared. These days I understand how seductive even the most unremarkable boy from Westfalia must have appeared to a Weimar girl on the wrong side of the wall. Work for everyone, not a bad idea either. They should have changed it to \u201cchallenging work for everyone\u201d, but failed to build a sustainable economy that could provide the required variety of jobs. I bet there are more isolated areas in which life in the East was quite enticing, better even. \u201cOstalgie\u201d (ostalgy) is a new German word that describes the craving for some aspects of life in East Germany. Without question East Germany excelled in the area of road signs. Apart from the arrow, the \u201cAmpelm\u00e4nnchen\u201d were nicer than those in the West. These days the East German Ampelm\u00e4nnchen are the mascot of commercial ostalgy. People take each other to court for the rights to market with them.  ",
