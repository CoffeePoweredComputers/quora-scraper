Britain, France, Italy and Belgium all acquired former German colonies as League of Nations mandates, but not in Europe. Britain and France used the entry of the Ottoman Empire into the war to acquire vast swathes of territory. These weren\u2019t war aims of either country in 1914, but emerged as the war went on.
