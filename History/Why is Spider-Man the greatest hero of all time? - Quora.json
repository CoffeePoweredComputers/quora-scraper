A lot of people will disagree with you and a lot will disagree with Me but i dont Think he is the greatest hero of all time. Simply because he isnt the strongest hero or the smartest. I Think the greatest hero is the one that is most powerful and able to control that power is the greatest hero. and of course Intelligence matters but the abillity to control your power just means you know how to use it.

            "answer_text": "He is not and I am a huge fan of Spidey. Superman is the greatest superhero of all time. It is he that most, if not all ,superheroes are based on. He is the template and in a sense, the father of all of them. Stan Lee once said in an interview that the creation of Superman might have been the single most important event in comic book history. He opened the door for the many that followed. ",
