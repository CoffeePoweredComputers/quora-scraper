            "answer_text": "I think very few because, hopefully, most people ask themselves: \u201cWhat has all of their postulating ever amounted to?\u201d For every concept one philosopher pontificates on, another will have a counter-proposal, or there might be several in agreement. So, how do we determine who has the best presentation? Do we vote on it? Who are the people that are telling us which philosopher is the winner? The traditional disputes of philosophers are, for the most part, as unwarranted as they are unfruitful. Philosophers are an end in themselves as their product consists of telling each and the rest of the world how important they are \u2026 \u201cThe Self-Appointed Arbiters of Truth\u201d TRUSTING in human philosophy is simply a matter of ignoring your best instincts and all your experiences and suspending disbelief. The fact is, the only way you can ever be sure if you can rely on someone or not is to go ahead and rely on them. But that doesn\u2019t always work out so well. People usually behave like people and let you down and that\u2019s that. Of course, if you know they\u2019re going to let you down then you won\u2019t be disappointed. There is no difference between a professional philosopher and an armchair philosopher. Both produce theories that are predicated on the minds of mortal, finite, untrustworthy mankind. We need a higher authority -- absolute, infinite, and omniscient to guide us ... that of God. Even though a philosophy consists of fine-sounding arguments, if its content is garbage it will not produce workable solutions to the daily struggles of faith and life. According to biblical Christianity, true religion is measured by what it produces as much as by what it teaches (see James 1:26-27; 2:14-26). ",

            "answer_text": "Most philosophy books are written by philosophy professors and are published by academic presses (and are read by only a few other professors). Professional philosophers like Bertrand Russell (long ago) and Richard Rorty (not so long ago) did write for intelligent people in general on occasion. Since there haven\u2019t been many career tenure-track positions available for PhDs in philosophy since about 1970 (at least here in the USA) many such folks try their hand at writing books for a popular audience, often with titles like How Ancient Stoicism Can Help Make You Successful or perhaps Impress Your Friends by Quoting Derrida or Immanuel Kant in 45 Minutes! Such publications are often written by very intelligent people and are usually marketed to morons. Of course, copies of classic and influential texts from the last 2,500 years of Western philosophy can be found yellowing on the shelves of any decent bookstore. How many such titles are actually sold is probably pretty small. The number of these that are actually read is, of course, even smaller. ",
