            "answer_text": "The coronavirus is growing bigger and bigger. There is a real problem in America with certain people trying to make political statements instead of being cautious about the virus. Let\u2019s be frank. If this happened while Obama was president, right wingers would have closed themselves off in bunkers and claimed the end of the world was here. But Trump is president, so these same people incredibly deny that the virus exists, and they even claim this is a liberal concoction to make Trump look bad. Widespread testing is needed. The wrong person was in the White House when this disease hit only in January. Only in January, and now it spreads around the world. This teaches us that new leadership is needed in the White House. We need more than a corrupt propagandist living in a fantasy world to lead this nation. We need to vote Trump out this November. ",
