            "answer_text": "Are cannons considered firearms? Are we talking modern twentieth/twenty-first century cannon? Then the answer is yes. Any gun with a barrel diameter of more than .50 inch and has no sporting purpose is a destructive device and requires a $200 tax stamp with additional background check. Any projectile with a explosive charge (not including the propellant) must also be registered as a destructive device with stamp. Nineteenth century cannons are not. An original or reproduction U.S. Civil War cannon, for instance, qualifies as \u201cnot a firearm\u201d according to the ATF. It is older than 1899, fires black powder, and doesn't use a cartridge. Though if it fired an exploding shell the shell would be a destructive device. ",

            "answer_text": "Cannon shells are classed as destructive devices in the U.S. under the 1934 National Firearms Act (NFA). They must be registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and, though legal under federal law, are prohibited from being owned by civilians in certain states. The cannon itself is not illegal but the shells are. ",
