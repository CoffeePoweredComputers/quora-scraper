            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll give you a frank answer. There is a section of Iranians, particularly those who long to hark back to the times of Shah, that perceive themselves culturally (may be racially as well) superior to South Asians in general, particularly those from the subcontinent. They don\u2019t hate you but can be rather condescending. In their view, Iran has been geographically misplaced in Asia instead of Europe (there is a great answer by Sam Sinai, just can\u2019t find it). The Shah of France [1]is their rightworthy ruler for them. The religious ones, the so-called regime supporters, however, are quite egalitarian in spirit with South Asians. They accept that Iran and South Asian connection goes back more than three millenia. Hence rather than fostering dreams of californication, they are happy with whatever they are. The former group pejoratively, refer to the founder of Islamic Republic of Iran as Hindizadeh[2] (literally meaning son of Hindustan, albeit a widely used surname in Iran. He was, however, born in Iran to a family who had migrated to India before resettling in Khomein, Iran[3] ) with implied condescension that such a man doesn\u2019t have culturally refined taste because of his land of birth. As such,many a times the Shah referred to him as uneducated[4]. On the other hand, the regime supporters see the term as a badge of honour, a kind of fervour synonymous with Che Guevara. Infact, the way Che tried to spread his revolution to whole of Latin America has interesting parallels with \u201cexport\u201d of ideas of Khomeini\u2019s revolution. They are basically centered at same aim of fighting western colonialism. While Che saw it as a class struggle, Khomeini saw it as a religious-cultural struggle. However, the paralelism ends if one contrast culturally liberal Guevara versus a conservative Khomeini. Enough digressions!!! You can see the contrast in Tehran itself, just travel from North to South. If you happen to find, Iranian students in South Asia, you\u2019ll find two circles of friends that they have. The monarchist will almost exclusively have europeans while being uninterested in natives in conformity with their Weststruckness[5]. While the religious ones will, ofcourse, be attending local mosques so they have a great deal of interaction with the natives. The former scenario is ofcourse a recent phenomenon of the bygone last century. I had a quora Iranian that frankly told me that Iranians, religious or otherwise, are not like people of South Asia. She was correct in a way but it was her obsession with western individualism that grabbed my attention. Sadly, she has deleted the post, so you\u2019ll have to believe my word. Sad but true! Also see, Sam Sinai's answer to Why Iranians are so obsessed with being Westernized? All said, this is my observation with a small section of Iranians. So if you have bumped up against some of them, sorry hard luck. Otherwise most of them are a hospitable lot.

            "answer_text": "Many Iranians migrated to Bengal throughout history in search of employment and spread Islam. The first two Iranians, Baba Kotwal of Isfahan and Qazi Ruknuddin of Samarqand, migrated in 1204, arriving as acquaintances of Bakhtiyar during his conquest of the region. The independent Bengal Sultanate was a stronghold for Iranian immigrants. With Farsi as an official language, Bengal witnessed an influx of Farsi scholars, lawyers, teachers and clerics from Iran. During the reign of Sultan Azam Shah, Sonargaon grew to become an important centre of Farsi literature, with many publications of prose and poetry. Among the other reputed centres of study were those situated in Darasbari, Rangpur, Dhaka, Sylhet, Bogra and Chittagong. Described as the \"golden age of Persian literature in Bengal\", its stature is illustrated by the Sultan's correspondence with Persian poet Hafez. When the Sultan invited Hafez to complete an incomplete ghazal, the poet responded by acknowledging the grandeur of the Sultan's court and the literary quality of Bengali-Persian poetry. Timurid Emperor Shah Rukh had diplomatic relations with Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah. Shah Rukh contributed to ending the 5-year long Bengal-Jaunpur War after pressuring the Jaunpuri ruler Ibrahim Shah to abstain from attacking Bengal \"or to take the consequence upon himself. To which the intimation of the Jaunpur ruler was obedient, and desisted from his attacks upon Bengal\".

            "answer_text": "To be honest Bangladesh still is unknown to many nationals despite its been 47 years since Bangladesh got its independence. Iranians think Bangladesh is part of India. They think we are Indians as they can't distinguish between us and Indians. This is actually sad reality. Iranians are mistaken for Arabs almost all the time and we, Bangladeshis are mistaken for Indians most of the time. Iranians hardly have any interaction with Bangladeshis to love or hate them. Iran is far away from Bangladesh. So far that its not in anyone's interest to have bilateral relation with each other. We, Bangladeshis are so attached with Indians that we even if try to have a separate identity from Indians simply we just can't due to we being completely surrounded by them. So not only Iran but most foreign nationals confuse us with Indian people. ",
