            "answer_text": "This question can have several \u201ccorrect\u201d answers, mainly depending on the personal knowledge, taste and bias of the individual. However, I don\u2019t believe there is a \u201cbest\u201d style of architecture. Architecture and human societies have developed hand to hand, with the former being the \u201cepitome\u201d of the latter. In simple terms, each great civilization of the human history manifested it\u2019s glory and achievements mainly through architecture (not neglecting other cultural aspects of course). It is very hard to judge which style or period had the best architecture, because we can base our opinions solely on the given historical facts we have, which most of the time, do not picture the whole reality of how each civilization developed. Mainly, every civilization \u201cborrowed\u201d something from someone else, and it\u2019s hard to say which was the original civilization that created something unique out of nothing. For example, the Roman architecture was influenced a great deal from the Greeks, but a little less known fact is that their culture in general was also greatly influenced by a preceding civilization in the Apennine peninsula, the Etruscans. With all this being said, if I had to cast my vote on the best style of architecture, that would be ancient Greece. Always referring to what history teaches us (reality could be something completely different) the ancient Greeks were one of the first people to actually have a very logical and mathematical explanation on almost every detail of their buildings. It was the first time the human had a template, or should I say, a formalized way of building, that not only made logical sense, but was also beautiful for a reason. I like to think of art or the beautiful of this world in two ways; beautiful for a reason, and beautiful just for the sake of it. The Greeks temples weren\u2019t the first to be beautiful, but in my opinion, were the first to have reason behind their beauty. ",

            "answer_text": "As others have mentioned the question invites some very subjective opinions. Nevertheless the question interests me since I had set up a blog from my travels (primarily in Europe) to establish criteria that would answer a similar question. My criteria diverges considerably from the conventional perspective by emphasizing two aspects of architecture that are often overlooked. First, the epoch: I believe 19th Century eclectic architecture emphasized certain features that had previously been overlooked in the more grandiose styles of preceding centuries. Of course, this was the romantic period and the architectural features of preceding epochs were often scaled down and applied to secular buildings although the worst examples mimicked the lavishness of their antecedents. Symmetry was respected and I believe worked best where it avoided monotony. Second, the scale: smaller buildings reflect civic pride. Town halls, custom houses, light houses, schools, garden pavilions, bell towers, banks and even fire houses were often garnished with architectural adornments that enhance their appearance. Many of these buildings have disappeared in the rush to build more functional structures and others have been grafted beyond recognition. Nonetheless, those that remain are an asset to their environment, as well as landmarks that instill civic pride and attract tourists. Blogger ",
