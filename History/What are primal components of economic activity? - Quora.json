            "answer_text": "I'm imagining that you are trying to define \"economic activity\" by getting back to basics, perhaps. The example given certainly tests our definitions. For instance, does economic activity need a formal framework, or can it be loose and flexible? Can we slip in and out as we please? Do we need a separate \"currency\" or simply to \"value\" the inputs and outputs in some relative way. And so on.  If you define it (as many do) as any action or set of actions that involve the production, distribution and consumption of valued goods and services within a society then you already have a few constraints imposed: it's within a society for starters and the goods have a \"value\" (which could of course be zero). In this case you have set up a society of hunter-gatherers and then isolated one member, presumably to get to the \"primal\" or primary components of his economic activities without distraction. However once separated from society the definition falls down - he has slipped out of our economic reference frame, at least for now. He (and you have stated he is a he so we'll go with that) can still produce a surplus but unless he gets back to his group soon or can process or store his produce for later exchange it's all rather pointless and the effort (in the form of surplus output) is wasted. His personal consumption is not wasted, just his surplus.  If we put him back into his society then it makes more sense. Assuming he didn't make all of his tools and clothing himself, some of that will have been made by others and is \"production\". It has a value. Offering it for trade or as a gift in expectation is \"distribution\" and his use is \"consumption\".  He takes his economic inputs plus another input - food (we could assume he finds that himself but equally it could be shared and exchanged prior to the journey) - and travels to where he hunts or gathers. He converts those inputs into expended energy, wear and tear using his tools and skill (his \"means of production\") and hopefully generates more production (his hunted and gathered \"goods\"). Unless he consumes it all himself he manages to garner a surplus (his production) for sharing or exchange when he returns (distribution to and consumption by the group).  You could sum up the values along the chain by using some arbitrary methodology and basic assumptions and estimate all relative inputs and outputs. It's economic activity as defined so long as he remains within (or returns to) a society and can share his production in some (hopefully reciprocal) fashion. ",

            "answer_text": "The primitive component is exchange. Much attention has been drawn to the Robinson Crusoe economy but it is misleading because Crusoe performs no exchange (and so cannot face any real scarcity) and property doesn't exist (because he owns everything). However, in the conventional methodology, an economy is considered to consist of producers and consumers. The breakdown of activities for producers is technical (i.e., what to produce and how to do it) and for consumers it is utilitarian (i.e., what to buy to make one's self happiest). Markets are the (ephemeral) places in which exchanges between producers and consumers take place. So the hunter gatherer needs to function as a consumer. In this role, he needs shelter, food, clothing, etc. And in the role of producer, he needs to decide how to produce the things that he (as a consumer) wants. The hunter gatherer becomes an \"economy\" when he joins his activities as a consumer with his activities as a producer. ",
