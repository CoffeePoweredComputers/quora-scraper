            "answer_text": "Hair and nails are essentially made up of keratinized epithelial cells.  For nails, it begins at the white crescent that is visible on our fingers, called the Lunula. From the Lunula, epithelial cells are produced, which die and get keratinized. This process repeats itself and as more and more cells are added, the nail bed or nail grows out. Similarly, epithelial cells are produced in the hair follicles within the skin. In the same manner, epithelial cells are produced, die, and get layered on. They eventually grow out and break from the skin. ",
