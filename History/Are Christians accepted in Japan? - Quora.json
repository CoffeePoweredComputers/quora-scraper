            "answer_text": "That\u2019s kind of a complicated question. If you mean accepted, as in do we have the freedom to worship as we please here? Yes. If you mean accepted in the sense of being respected, have allowances made for our religious observations, or non-Christians being eager to hear about our beliefs? Mostly no. Since I am a foreigner the fact that I am a Catholic Christian is no big deal, and no big surprise to anyone. I have had one person get all defensive, and tell me, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about God or religion,\u201d even though I wasn\u2019t proselytizing in any way, but merely mentioned in passing that I was Christian. My guess is that she was on guard because we have a lot of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in our neighborhood who go door to door regularly. Many Japanese don\u2019t know the difference between Catholic, Protestant, Mormon, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, etc. - at all. If a Japanese person mentions to a co-worker, neighbor, or acquaintance that he is a Christian the response will most likely be a polite, \u201coh, really?\u201d and that\u2019s about it. Inside they may be thinking that it\u2019s weird for a fellow Japanese person to take up a \u201cforeign\u201d or \u201cwestern\u201d religion, but not many people would openly say so out loud to that person\u2019s face. If a Japanese person chooses to become a Chirstian, and all of their family is non-Christian\u2026 that\u2019s often quite a different story, especially if the person is an eldest or only son, or a woman married to the eldest/only son. It was not easy for my husband, the only son of his parents, at all. His family was very unhappy about his decision, and it\u2019s still a sore spot at times even though decades have passed since he was baptized (before we met). I know women who have desperately wanted to be baptized, were in involved in church regularly, but waited years and years for their husbands\u2019 approval (out of respect for him, not out of fear). I know some women who have given up, deciding they weren\u2019t up for the struggle. I know some women who have become Christians, but their husbands won\u2019t allow their children to attend or be baptized, and there are quite a few men in our parish who attend alone every week without their wives and children. For the most part, I personally feel no problem whatsoever in living out my faith here in Japan. Christians tend to have very tight-knit relationships with each other, and if we live out our Christianity faithfully we have no reason to have trouble getting along with others. It can be difficult for people to make it to church if their job is very hectic - no allowances are made for taking off for attending worship or church events. Young people are extremely busy from Jr. High age and on, even on the weekends, and it can be very difficult to get out of school or club obligations to attend church. Obligatory community meetings and gatherings are often on Sunday, so that can be troublesome at times. Aside from the possibility of big family problems due to religious differences those are probably the most difficult things we encounter in every day life. ",

The Japanese have a very practical attitude towards religion, and this extends to allowing religious communities to build places of worship and openly promote their religion in public.

[1] I\u2019m surprised at this data. Honestly, I had never thought there were so many Christians in Japan. I only know 2 in person in my whole life. I guess people tend to not tell their beliefs to others because religions are considered something shady here, whatever it is. In this sense, it\u2019s legally allowed but not fully accepted by society, I\u2019d say.
