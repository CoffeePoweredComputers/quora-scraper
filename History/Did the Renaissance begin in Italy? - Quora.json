            "answer_text": "Yes, Renaissance sparked in Italy\u2014more specifically in Florence\u2014initially and then quickly spread to the rest of Western Europe. The main reason is the location of Italy in the Mediterranean. In addition, Rome was the HQ of the Roman Catholic Church, a violent prototype of the modern United Nations. Popes were elected by Cardinals who represented the powerful kings and families all over Europe, and so Rome was perceived to be the political, cultural and religious capital of Europe. Italian states like Venice and Florence were independent enclaves and they experimented with new financial systems, democracy, elections, artistic freedom, inventions etc. and free thinkers could find havens in different parts of Italy even though the Catholic Church kept hunting for them. In addition, the Popes were increasingly becoming unpopular and questions arose about the legitimacy of religion itself. By mid 1400s Europe was ready for an intellectual revolution. And then fortuitously came the Printing press, Reformation, split in the Church, inventions, expeditions, discoveries of riches in America and India. The birth of Protestantism after 1500 caused the Catholic Church too to reform itself and become more accommodative to new ideas. (Contrary to popular belief, Galileo was punished mainly because of his arrogance towards his fellow professors than by claiming the earth went around the sun. But arrogance could not be punished so his cosmological discovery was branded a heresy.) Then there was the profound influence of Muslim and Jewish intellectuals: Below: Medical textbook by Ibn Sina (11th century)  Ottoman Empire, and the Arabic philosophy and science also increased the diversity that Italy experienced in 15th century. Arabic textbooks were feverishly translated to Latin often disobeying the church censorship. Translated works were printed and sold in different parts of Europe. early 16th century Venice became the center of book publishing, with several master printers and typographers from different parts of Europe establishing themselves in the city of marches. The Renaissance permitted free thinkers in different branches of science to express their views more openly. New experimentation began to diminish the domination of Muslim and Jewish textbooks on medical sciences which were often the last words in healthcare from 10th century AD. Medical treatises by Zakaria Al Razi, Ibn Sina, Ibn Al Haytham etc. and works of Jewish philosophers like Maimonide continued to be debated and questioned and improved in Italian universities. Apart from printing technology, the main reason for proliferation of medical knowledge in Italy during the Renaissance was that dissection of cadavers was now permitted (albeit with extreme reluctance). Leonardo Da Vinci and Michelangelo were pioneers in this regard. They had autopsied cadavers secretly at first and produced breathtaking illustrations that showed some of the earlier notions to be inaccurate \u2014 finally the Church had to let go of its stance against dissecting the human body which led to new wondrous discoveries. New investigations are investigating Leonardo da Vinci's knowledge of the brain by analyzing his anatomical drawings: a fitting tribute to his death centenary due in May 2019. (below: Anatomical sketch by Leonardo da Viinci) (c. 1500)  Latin language, slowly eclipsed Arabic as the \u201clanguage of science.\u201d Here the main responsibility was that of the Ottoman and Persian imams who steadfastly refused to allow Arabic books to be printed. This was how the Middle East gave up its early starter advantage and eventually lost out on the knowledge race. Intellectuals from Europe began to prefer autonomous universities such as the Bologna University relatively free from church and state influences. From 1450 to 1500, 72% of all printed books were in Latin and the maximum number (>4100) were printed in Italy (Venice and Rome). The second rank went to Germany with some 3400 books followed by France which printed some 2800. Incunabula Collections But within a century the Germany, Netherlands, France and Spain took the leadership and led the Enlightenment period. England was a latecomer but it defeated the competition very very fast, (mainly because of higher empowerment of peasants and common citizens) which was why industrial revolution began there. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, of course. But we must not forget the contribution given by refugees from the fallen former Eastern Roman Empire (Costantinopolis, today\u2019s Istanbul, was token by the Turkish in 1453 AD). Talking Painting, for instance, I can give you an example of how important was the Byzantine Civilization for Europe. Outside a village I used to live at, in Northern Italy, there\u2019s a small chapel built on the side of what once was a secondary branch of the main Francigena Road (it means the road \u201cgenerating from France\u201d which run from Northern France to Rome). In that chapel, you can see the remains of a fresco painted well before 1000 AD, by some maestro who had studied at the then famous School of Painting of the Monastery of Reichenau (Germany). And were used the Reichenau first maestros go and study? If not at Costantinopolis, surely in some city of the Greek Eastern Mediterranean area. ",
