Before he became president, in a letter dated January 26, 1900 to fellow politician Henry Harrison Sprague, he wrote: \u201cSpeak softly and carry a big stick...\u201d In other words, always be diplomatic, but have a decent sized military should anything go wrong. At least that is how I have always interpreted it. Should anyone out there disagree, I will be only too happy to be put right on the matter. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say like the country of China today. After the Maoists defeated the Nationalists and set up their new communism, it was always pragmatic and looked to the future. China only fights small battles like in India, Tibet and knows that wars can only bankrupt their progress, but is building a vast modern military that has a long view in geopolitics that sees Taiwan, Hong Kong and all the continent of Asia as their sphere of influence, kicking out America and sending South Korea and Japan to their little corners. The American Navy will leave Asia one day, and Korea, Japan, The Philippines will have to fend for themselves or band together like western Europe after 1945. China right now is not looking for a wasteful war, but they will defend and build and advance in a planned way that is very hard for the world to understand, but I can see one day China will be the lone superpower of the world due to its long view and forward thinking that can be done in a communist political culture.

Israel has had to fight for it\u2019s very existence. Israel has not invaded but has reacted to invasion. All the lands that Israel has taken were part of Israel when it was a country 2500 years ago. It was the Romans that put an end to Israel as a country in 70 A.D. If Israel were to take what existed at the time of King David, there would be no \u201cPalestine\u201d as that was all part of Israel. ",
