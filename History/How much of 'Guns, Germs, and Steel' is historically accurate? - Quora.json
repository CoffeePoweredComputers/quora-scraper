            "answer_text": "It is not an issue of whether GGS is a \u201chistorically accurate\u201d book. It is not a history text. It is really a hybrid popular anthropological/historical work\u2014Diamond is an anthropologist. Diamond\u2019s anthropological and historical descriptions are accurate enough as I recall. I don\u2019t think there has been a lot of criticism of the work saying that Diamond got his facts wrong. Where people have differences with the author is in his thesis. That thesis is that environmental conditions are determinative, pretty much to the effective exclusion of almost all other factors, with respect to how societies evolve. I don\u2019t think any reasonable person would dispute that environment plays, and has played, a significant role in the way societies develop, it is a question of degree. Diamond\u2019s thesis is like mother\u2019s milk to modern world historians who largely see their mission as playing down the Western orientation of histories written before the latter half of the 20th Century. A problem in this project is explaining the rise of West without attributing any special worthiness to Western accomplishments or culture. Diamond\u2019s thesis is that basically the West got lucky, and by implication that luck will eventually run out. World historians, who like most academics tend to lean left, like that. His critics tend to be traditional classicists and the like\u2014Victor Davis Hanson is one\u2014who find Diamond\u2019s approach to history and anthropology something akin to B.F. Skinner\u2019s work in psychology. I\u2019ve taught World History for 20 years, and keep a copy of GGS near my desk, though I don\u2019t reference it a lot. I think it is a good book, with a lot of truths in it, though tendentiously written at times. I like Diamond\u2019s \u201cThe Third Chimpanzee\u201d (much more a work of pure popular anthropology) better. ",

Why did Greenland\u2019s Vikings disappear? Cultural adaptation, compounding vulnerabilities and conjunctures in Norse Greenland The author\u2019s explanation for the disappearance of the complex society and a large part of the population on Easter Island: cultural based over explotaci\u00f3n of local resources, has been challenged by others who have suggested more complex explanations, including the introduction of rats by the first Polynesian settlers and the introduction of European diseases and slave raiding after the arrival of Europeans to the Americas. How a sustainable society has been falsely blamed for its own demise The myth of Easter Island\u2019s ecocide Although, the case for dismissing Diamond\u2019s ideas about collapse on Easter Island is not so strong as that for Greenland. http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27864/1/WP117.pdf Diamond\u2019s blame of over exploration of local resources for the abandonment of classical Mayan city states has also been challenged. For example The Maya Forest: Destroyed or cultivated by the ancient Maya?
