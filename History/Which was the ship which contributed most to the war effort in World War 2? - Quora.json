            "answer_text": "On balance it was the USS Enterprise, which launched the planes that sunk two Japanese aircraft carriers at the battle of Midway. This was the major turning point in the Pacific war. In all Japan lost 4 carriers and more significantly most of her best pilots. From then on Japan lost her ability to dominate the seas and it was really a matter of time (and of course much very bitter fighting) before Japan lost the war.  Enterprise was commissioned in 1938, she displaced 25,500 tons full load. And could carry 90 aircraft. She was one of the carriers that were famously not in port when Pearl Harbour was attacked. Enterprise carried torpedo bombers, dive bombers, fighters, and scouting planes. Midway was a very complex air battle and detailed accounts can be found elsewhere, but Enterprises part, on 4th June 1942, was to launch torpedo and dive bomber attacks once the location of the Japanese carriers had been discovered. The torpedo planes lost their fighter cover and were shot to pieces by Zero fighters before they could press home an attack, but the Dauntless dive bombers got through to Japanese fleet carriers Akagi and Kaga scoring hits on both. Fires on these carriers burnt out of control and they were both ultimately scuttled rather than risk them falling into American hands. Later that day, planes from Enterprise, and the now disabled and sinking Yorktown, attacked the last remaining Japanese carrier Hiryu, scoring fatal hits that led to her destruction. Next day Enterprises dive bombers, together with planes from Hornet, sank the heavy cruiser Mikuma. At Midway Japan lost 4 fleet carriers (one third of her fleet carriers), 248 planes and a heavy cruiser. Perhaps most significantly they lost the cream of their experienced pilots. Japan did not have an adequate naval pilot training system. What they had was a very slow training program which completely failed to provide effective pilots to replace losses after Midway. They built more carriers and more planes but without able pilots they were unable to resist American air power. Enterprise, and her air wing, did more than any other single ship to influence that course of WW2. ",
