            "answer_text": "One thing that non-gamer parents don't seem to get is that the movie rating system used by the Motion Picture Association of America, or MPAA, and the video game rating system used by the Entertainment Software Rating Board, or ESRB, are pretty much the same; just with different letters. I would hope that parents tend to actually watch what their kids try to watch, as they know the movie rating system, and act accordingly there. They should also do so with games. In most normal games, ratings start with E for Everyone. This is pretty much box-standard G for General Audiences. Games and movies with this rating, like everyone knows, have little if anything that may offend parents if their kids watched or played. But, of course, what the \u201centitled\u201d gamers don't seem to get is that these games are for, well, everyone. They are NOT specifically for children; nor do you automatically have the mind of a child if you play these games. Why I put this is because I've seen some idiots who bash on those who play \u201cchildish\u201d games like Pok\u00e9mon or Mario. Plus, those people don't seem to get that these games can have dark and even mature themes that can tend to fly over children's heads; even if the games themselves are not specifically based around those themes.E 10+, or Everyone 10 and up, is like normal PG; Parental Guidance. It's a little bit too risky for an Everyone rating, but isn't bad enough to really have to exclude older kids.T for Teen is like PG-13. There's a bit more than E 10+/PG, and may not really be suitable for anyone younger than 13 years old, but it's not terribly bad.M for Mature is exactly what it says on the tin. It's suitable for those who are 17 or older. Kids aren't very well able to handle this stuff without their parents; much like the content that a movie that is rated R can contain. If a parent would let a little kid watch an R-rated movie alone, there's something wrong with them, and it should very well be the same as with an M-rated game.AO, or Adults Only, contains even more. These games should obviously be thought of as the NC-17 rating in movies. Kids are NOT allowed by any means to watch these movies, and they should NOT be allowed by any means to play these games.This obviously isn't mentioning games that have the EC, or Early Childhood rating, but those are games meant for preschool-age kids; usually purely education-oriented so there's clearly nothing risky there. There isn't an MPAA equivalent unlike the other ratings, but it doesn't need one anyway, for obvious reasons. ",

            "answer_text": "There was a time when video games were just \u2018games\u2019 that you used to play on your computer or on your TV via console. You used to pop a CD/cartridge in, play for a bit and get back to completing your homework. But video games have changed a lot, especially as they start influencing real life aspects. Some of the lesser-known gaming facts in the video game industry are: >Most Expensive In-Game Purchase Ever - $6 Million: A company paid $6 Million in real cash for a virtual island in the MMORPG game \u201cEntropia Universe\u201d. The record for 2nd, 3rd and 4th most expensive virtual items sold also belong to the same game! >A Game that haunts your PC: There\u2019s a game called Doki Doki Literature Club, that messes up your computer quietly (in no harmful way) to creep you out and make you question reality and your sanity. >The largest PvP battle of its kind in history of gaming: A legendary battle took place in the online multiplayer game Eve Online, which involved 7,500 players (at the same time) and cost nearly $300,000 of real money. It was so epic in scale, there\u2019s even an Wikipedia article on it! >A game with graphics so advanced that no PC could run it: When the game \u2018Crysis\u2019 was introduced in 2007, it had life-like graphics and lighting effects. But no existing PC was able to run it at highest settings at that time. In fact, it took more than 3\u20135 years for PC hardware to catch up and be able to run the game at the highest settings. >A game plot twist that puts even the best movie twists to shame: Braid is an indie game released in 2008. At first look, it looks like any other side-scrolling game with a hero looking for his princess and stuff. Its only when you get down to the last level, you\u2019ll realize the shocking twist: you\u2019re not what you think you are. >A game that took more time to develop than the entire line-up of Marvel movies: The game Duke Nukem Forever (released in 2011) had been in development for 15 years, since 1996. In comparison, Marvel made 21 movies in just 10 years. >A Pokemon game soundtrack that is alleged to be cursed/haunted: The games in Pokemon Red and Green series had a level called \u2018Lavender Town\u2019, which has a soundtrack that was alleged to have been the cause of many suicides among children in Japan because of its creepy, hypnotic tone. It got so bad that Nintendo had to change the soundtrack for international releases of the game. While it may or may not be true, you can still listen to the original soundtrack here (Caution advised!) >A game that deleted itself after you completed it: There are rumors of existence of a creepy PC game known as \u201cKillswitch\u201d, which was a 2d game from early 90s. After you completed the final level of the game, it supposedly erased itself from the hard disk and left no traces of it. You could not even copy it, and this is the reason why no one has been able to verify its authenticity. P.S: Most of the facts here are not \u2018unknown\u2019 facts among the gaming community, but nevertheless they are cool to share, especially for those who haven\u2019t heard of them. ",
