            "answer_text": "No. Clive was concerned solely with the affairs of the London based East India Company who were his initial employers. In later years he effectively worked for various local Indian rulers who had requested his or John Companies help. The East India trade greatly enriched both UK and India, for that is the way of trade, what recompense can possibly be due? Even if you cook up some kind of \u2018recompense\u2019 for alleged suffering, you need to balance that with costs and suffering of the men and ships who carried the trade. Trade is trade, it is not plunder, no possible claim for alleged recompense for damages can possibly exist. And as a pracal matter, UK today is too broke to be able to make any possible payments. Incidentally, India\u2019s most popular car since the 1950s was the Morris Oxford, later known as the Hindustan Ambassador. Many, many cars to this design have been built each year for more than 60 years \u2014 what royalties have been paid over that period, and have they been indexed for inflation? ",

The point was the colonies were banned from trading directly with other states all shipments had to go through UK ports. For example an Indian Ship would have to dock and unload in the UK even if the goods were sold to France. Then a British based ship would carry the goods to France. ",
