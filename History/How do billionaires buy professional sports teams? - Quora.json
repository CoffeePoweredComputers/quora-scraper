            "answer_text": "The short answer is have a group of the right friends and associates with deep pockets that the owners like and has a managing partner that lives in the team\u2019s home city. When a franchise is available a partner we\u2019ll call the Managing Partner contacts a few of his friends whom he/she thinks would like to make a long term investment. It\u2019s a long term investment because owners do not take money as profits from a franchise until they sell the franchise to someone else. The investors need a face to put in front of the camera\u2019s and it should be somebody the other 30 teams like . For the Dodgers it was Stan Kastan who had done the same kind of thing for the Braves and Nationals. In the current Marlins negotiation it\u2019s been Derek Jeter in once group and Tom Glavine and Al Leiter in another. It\u2019s critical that this person be liked by the owners because they get the final say. The Major League Constitution, Article V section 2 (b) say that a vote of three-quarters of the Major League Clubs must approve various things dealing with team expansion, ownership etc.  It should be easy to get 20 of the 30 owners on your side but the commissioner has a powerful voice in such things. In fact the commissioner\u2019s office looks closely at each ownership group and his recommendation has never been over turned. The commissioner may work for the teams but he also disciplines the teams. Because of this wide power the commissioner wants owners who won\u2019t publicly challenge his words, talk badly about other owners, umpires and other MLB office holders. MLB also has an asset/liability ratio of 60/40 so owners must have the liquidity to keep that ration relatively in place. Under Bud Selig the Frank McCourt owned Dodgers got into a financial mess and eventually McCourt had to sell. Typically the owner(s) sets the sale price and then negotiates with the potential ownership groups. Once formal negotiations are underway the Commissioners office gets officially involved. When MLB took over the Expos however the process went differently because they didn\u2019t even have to act like they weren\u2019t picking a group Selig liked. According to Stark: End the Cuban embargo on ESPN it was fairly simple. You might recall that baseball didn't open that Expos sale to the highest bidder. Instead, it told the eight bidders: \"Here's the price we're going to get. Now stop by for an interview so we can decide which of you is most worthy.\" While Selig fell hard on McCourt he wasn\u2019t nearly as aggressive with the Mets and Fred Wilpon who had ties too and lost money as a result of dealings with Bernie Madoff. Nor did he nix Jeffrey Loria\u2019s bid to take over the Marlins even though many thought Loria rand the Expos into the ground on purpose. In How Baseball Owners Made Their Fortunes they explain that it was all part of a big mega owner switch. After a series of miscues (some accuse these of being deliberate), Loria couldn't secure English-language television rights and demanded tax funds for a new stadium (the request was denied). In 2002, with the help of commissioner Bud Selig, Loria sold the Expos to MLB for $120 million. John W. Henry, the owner of the Marlins at the time, then sold the Florida team to Loria for $158.5 million, making it possible for Henry to buy the Red Sox. The Expos were then moved to D.C. to become the Nationals. All three moves happened almost simultaneously, with all parties working closely together on the switches. As bad as Loria was and is when it suited Selig he ignored the obvious warning flags and mad it happen. This multiowner swap appeared to be created to get John Henry to Boston without regard to Loria\u2019s ineptitude Now Loria is selling the Marlins and in spite of a Forbes valuation of $675M In 2016 he\u2019s ask for $1.6 billion in January though that dropped to $1.2billion last month. MLB wants a local owner for their teams. In the case of the Marlins it was first Jeb Bush who has since backed out and according to this tweet Jorge Mas was the front runner in July #BREAKING Sources are telling @FoxBusiness that @MLB is worried Jorge Mas could drop out of the @Marlins bidding war. More NOW @FoxBusiness!\u2014 Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) July 17, 2017\n Mas would fit the bill for MLB but Loria wants to force the price up. New owners would have to have a lot of assets because the current asset/liability ratio doesn\u2019t meet requirements. Eventually Rob Manfred who inherited this owner and his mess will have to sort it out. Until then the Marlins will continue to be the worst run team in baseball. I hope this helps. ",
