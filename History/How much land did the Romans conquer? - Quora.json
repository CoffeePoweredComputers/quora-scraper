            "answer_text": "This is what I remember, though googling it might be more accurate. The Roman Empire, at its height was roughly as large, in land area as the United States is today. It covered almost all of the area around the Mediterranean, including all of the coastal areas of North Africa and all of Greece, Macedonia, Italy, Spain, Romania and the surrounding countries, part of Western Turkey, Germany England, though not Scotland, as Scotland was never subdued.

            "answer_text": "They conquered close to 2 million square miles at their height. All the land around the Mediterranean Sea was Roman. The entire romance language speaking region of Europe. They conquered England and Wales all the way up to Scotland. Modern day Belgium. The Balkans. Greece, Turkey, Syria, Isreal, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Morocco. They also briefly conquered but didn't province or hold about a third of Germany and the Parthian Empire making it all the way to the Persian Gulf. Not too bad for an Italian city and its allies. ",
