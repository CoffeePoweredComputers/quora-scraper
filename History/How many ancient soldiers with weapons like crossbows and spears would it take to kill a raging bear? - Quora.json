            "answer_text": "What kind of bear is it? If it is a black bear then a man with a stick could potentially scare it away (unlikely but possible.) Additonally black bears are much smaller than grizzly bears, or polar bears, and are easier to scare away. Grizzly bears on the other hand will fight you until the precived threat is eliminated particularly if protecting their young. Grizzly bears, and polar bears are also so much harder to kill. I\u2019d be scared to try and kill one with a rifle let alone a bow, or spear. So if it is a black bear , or brown bear only one man with a spear would be needed if he knows what he is doing. Or a horse archer, or mounted crossbowman could just shoot the bear until it dies. This gets a bit more complicated when we start talking about the larger bears. Though I would say even a small party of men armed with spears, bows, and crossbows could take a grizzly or polar bear down rather easily if they work as a team. A horse archer or mounted crossbowman by himself could potentially take down a grizzly or polar bear, but it would take quite a few shots. Even a mortal wound may not stop a bear from charging. Even a single spearman could though he would be trying his luck. In short it doesn\u2019t take that many. It may only take one. Indeed we do know that it is possible for a single experienced spearman to take down large animals by himself as this was done very often by Roman gladiators. ",

Traditional Finnish \u201cKarhukeih\u00e4s\u201d \u201cBear Spear\u201d Typical usage of said weapon is either to stick trapped bear, or if used against attacking bear its other end is braced against ground and allow attacking animal to spear itself against it. African native tribes used same kind of idea against lions when doing lion hunting with traditional weapons.  ",
