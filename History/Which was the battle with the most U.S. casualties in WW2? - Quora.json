            "answer_text": "Probably the Battle of Okinawa which had between 12,000 to 14,00 confirmed American fatalities and over 82,000 American casualties. That does not include several thousand personal who dies indirectly of wounds or other illnesses at a later date. The Battle of Okinawa was the most brutal fight imaginable with massive psychological breakdowns on both sides. It was thought to be the final prelude to a full scale invasion of the Japanese mainland. Accordingly, the Japanese unleashed everything they had, most notably their kamikaze style. At the same time, they were handicapped by the fact that the native Okinawans had been pressed into service and were not really willing to die for Imperial Japan. In any event, it was a very bloody affair. There are some who would argue that the Battle of the Bulge had more casualties and fatalities but those numbers are hotly disputed. While some historians have claimed that over 19,000 Americans dies in that battle, that figure now is generally discredited as highly inflated. Eisenhower\u2019s official account put the number of Americans killed at the Battle of the Bulge at 8,600. Officially the overall casualty count for American troops was around 89,000, which would top that of Okinawa. But again, it is likely that the figures for the Battle of the Bulge are inflated and those of Okinawa under-counted. The very different natures of the two encounters would lend itself to disparate counting. In any event, those are the top two contenders. I should note that probably more Americans were killed at Normandy than any other battle of World War II but the question seems to be asking about overall casualties. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how you define \u201cbattle\u201d and \u201cdeadliest\u201d. Far and away, the Battle of Normandy, with a quarter million casualties among the US and Allies is the most for a \u201cbattle\u201d. But as others have pointed out, Normandy is a big place, and that is a roll up of many smaller, distinct \u201cbattles\u201d. In Battle of the Bulge, the US took over 100,000 casualties*** with about 20,000 KIAs in some truly vicious fighting in brutal weather. This was a more compact thing, but you still had sub-battles and dispersed unit action, so does it count as a \u201cbattle\u201d? Operation Iceberg (Invasion of Okinawa) had about 55,000 casualties with about 12,000 KIAs, but again, you have separate actions, just as you are going to any time you get that many divisions operating in one place at one time. Still, Okinawa is pretty compact. Set your criteria for what counts as a battle, and your criteria for what is deadliest \u2014 for example, do you only count KIAs, or do later DOWs get included, are WIAs included, if so, do they have to be removed from the battlefield? More specific terms will get you a more specific answer. *** Unless cold injury resulted in an amputation, it was not considered a casualty at the time. This has changed in the interim 70 years as more is learned about the long term effects of cold injury. By todays standards, that number would be much higher that 100,000. ",
