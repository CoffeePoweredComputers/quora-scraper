            "answer_text": "If you are talking about the first millenium era, Germanic tribes never migrated from Central Europe en masse. Recent genetic studies and archeology discoveries go more and more against the theory of mass migrations of people from Germania region (as Germanic is geographical name). There was a discovery in central Poland near Rogozno proving that this region wasn\u2019t abandoned by local population in the mid first millenium (http://scienceinpoland.pap.pl/en/news/news%2C31508%2Cnew-evidence-human-presence-poland-late-antiquity.html) and that\u2019s only one example of recent discoveries. Yes, some groups of people travelled south and west to conquer Roman empire, but these were mainly male warriors and their families (see example: Barbarian DNA from European cemeteries reveals secrets of mysterious ancient society). The theory of mass migration of Germanic tribes was popularized by the Nazis and Nazi era archeologist Gustaf Kossina and this was used as excuse to attack and expel Slavic tribes living in the region.

Germanic people mostly migrated to Central Europe and other parts of Europe from Scandinavia during the Iron Age. It was during the Hun invasions of Europe that many Germanic tribes migrated into Western Europe. However Germanic tribes did not wipe out the original inhabitants of Western Europe. As for Turks they migrated to parts of Europe and Asia from Central Asia. The Fall of Rome (150CE-475CE)  ",
