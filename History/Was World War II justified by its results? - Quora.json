            "answer_text": "No. Absolutely not. No war can be justified by its results, as going into a conflict the result are never guaranteed. The outcome of WWII was favourable to the allied powers, and (hopefully) those that were oppressed under the axis powers. Going into WWII the allies were unaware of the full extent of the atrocities being caused. If you look at it from that view you can justify the conflict, but on the side the massive loss of life, not just military personnel, but across Europe and Asia the loss of civilian personal is a cost too high. Many hundreds of people died, and thousands of civilians lost everything, including all family. Hundreds of children became orphaned often overnight, on both sides of the conflict. Economies across Europe and Asia were completely devastated. The world in 1946 was completely devastated, with the exception of a few countries that had not seen conflict within it\u2019s boarders (such as the continental North American nations). The outcome wasn\u2019t all \u201cpeachy\u201d. But as if often the case, it was a war that had to be fought by many to protect their homes and families. That isn\u2019t justification, as that nee for protection could have been avoided, had the conflict not began in the first instance. ",

            "answer_text": "Just a quickie: For a principle-centered person, which I wish we could find more of, the results do not justify a thing. The thing, in this case the most deadly calamity that has befallen the human species, must find justification in the reason for which it was fought. The German people were hit hard by the penalties imposed by the Allied Powers in WWI. Add the Great Depression to that, and a whole nation was primed to be led by any madman who can rouse them into a fighting spirit. The Japanese were likewise hurt by sanctions, and that generation also remembered quite well how Admiral Perry\u2019s Black Fleet humiliated them, their nation, and their god-emperor. The culture that their ruling class enjoyed was destroyed. And when they used traditionally-honored force to gather resources (their island really has little in the way of raw materials), the Europeans and Americans got in their way, further rubbing their face in ignominy. The Italians, well, they were in the midst of every political tug-of-war, and they were happy to fall in under Mussolini. As was said at the time, \u201cat least he made the trains run on time.\u201d So everybody felt justified\u2014by the results they felt they were getting. Not good. Much like the atomic bomb. Nearly every American justifies its use by saying it gave a better result than an invasion, and they were asking for it, anyway. Even most of the senior generals at the time had the character and principles to say the atomic bombs were not justifiable. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessary to hit them with that damned thing.\u201d tells the view of most American generals, including Eisenhower and MacArthur. \u201cMy God, the Americans are barbarians!\u201d \u2014 Zhukov.
