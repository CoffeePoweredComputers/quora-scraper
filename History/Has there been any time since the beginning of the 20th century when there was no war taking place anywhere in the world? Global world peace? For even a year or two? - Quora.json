            "answer_text": "It depends on what you consider a war. If you include internal rebellions and civil wars, then probably not. If you are only including international wars among states, then there were a few periods of peace, including longer ones, such as 1906\u201310 and 1922\u201330, but then after that came 65 years of war, since the Cold War was punctuated by numerous colonial wars and proxy wars involving the superpowers, although by 1996\u20132001 wars were few, small, and pretty intermittent, though the exact dates of starting and ending are rather imprecise. For example, the UN war against Iraq ended in 1991, but thereafter the US and its allies enforced a \u201cno fly zone\u201d over much of the country that involved occasional bombing. ",

            "answer_text": "Well first you have to define war. There are, you remember, many reasonably powerful family groups which though small compared with nations, are capable of engaging in politics in all the same levels as a sovereign state (with due limits to lack of resources) and when those politics lead to violence it is hard to tell whether it is war, vendetta, or crime as these flow seemlessly into each other. Given that, I would say there has been no time in recorded history where there wasn\u2019t a war going on somewhere, though wars have sometimes been waged at such a low level as to be irrelevant to most people.
