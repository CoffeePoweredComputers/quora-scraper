            "answer_text": "Because he is a dead white British male. In today\u2019s \u2018woke\u2019, hyper-sensitive culture, white men are the only group it is acceptable to hate. He ticks every box: white (tick), male (tick), half American and half British (double tick), upper class (tick), patriotic (tick). It would be odd if people weren\u2019t turning against him. Most young British people seem to think it\u2019s cool to hate Churchill; I guess they think it makes them sophisticated and progressive. It doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s just an example of how weak-minded and easily led they are. Basically, Western Europe and North America are at a tipping point. Gradually, white people are becoming the minority. We are not there yet, but that\u2019s the direction we are heading. White Europeans, for example, are barely reproducing. Next door to Europe, however, is Africa, with the highest birth rate in the world. The future of Europe is African and Muslim, and the quickest way to make white people accept this change is to make them ashamed of their past. By the way, I\u2019m not a huge fan of Churchill. He was a typical 19th century aristocrat \u2013 arrogant, militaristic, a bit of a war-monger (he literally danced for joy when WW1 broke out). But you have to judge people by the standards of their time. You also have to remember that we live in a time of peace and prosperity. Churchill was almost single-handedly trying to save Western civilisation, and it was a close run thing. It\u2019s easy to be a smug little liberal when you live in 2020, much harder when the bombs are falling. No doubt some mindless little drone will tell me that he was responsible for the Bengal famine as well. He wasn\u2019t. I have a pretty neutral view of him. In general I\u2019d say he is overrated. He made all sorts of crazy, risky, idiotic decisions, and in 1940 he took a heck of a gamble, which luckily paid off (mainly because the Nazis invaded Russia in 1941). But I do respect him, up to a point. I\u2019ve reached that conclusion by thinking for myself, which might be hard for a modern liberal to understand. You see, we don\u2019t all mindlessly regurgitate what we read in The Guardian. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy is Winston Churchill an increasing controversial figure?\u201d Putting it bluntly, because the British are a nation ignorant of history, yet mired in nostalgia. Nostalgia is a sepia toned filter, that removes all of the nasty, gritty bits of history and replaces them with warm, fuzzy feelings of pride and self congratulation. Winston Churchill was a controversial figure throughout his career, and has remained so for many people outside of the UK. He\u2019s always been a controversial figure in Ireland. He\u2019s always been a controversial figure in Australia and New Zealand. He\u2019s always been a controversial figure in India He\u2019s always been a controversial figure for Trades Unionists. I won\u2019t detail these controversies, there is plenty of resource out there if you wish to know more. I won\u2019t comment on them either; there is plenty of debate on all of these controversies, with various arguments about Churchill\u2019s culpability and conduct. But the point is, the controversies have never gone away in those countries, nor in the minds of serious historians in the UK. None of this detracts from his achievements in WW2, but his achievements in WW2 have been used to gloss over the controversies. As the war fades from living memory, the filter of nostalgia removes all the problems with Churchill, and has seen his reputation polished beyond all recognition. The British are spoon fed tales of his heroism, of his ability to unite the nation with his glorious speeches, his single handed opposition to the evils of Naziism. No other view is tolerated, he was our \u201cGreatest Briton\u201d, and anyone who says otherwise is a traitor. His faults are passed off as being \u201cof his time\u201d, something that\u2019s done in several of the replies to this question. So when anyone tries to discuss the actual facts of his career in modern Britain, it is controversial. This can also be seen as part of a wider culture war going on right now, with the \u201ctraditionalists\u201d, seeking to recast British history in a positive light, and the progressives seeking to question it. This is not a new phenomenon, but it\u2019s currently being played out along racial and political lines, which is making the conversation pretty poisonous. It means that his defenders often resort to either name calling, covert racism, or historical distortions. It means that his detractors often overstep the mark, and fail to acknowledge his importance and his strength, or the times through which he lived. Just to give some personal examples, I have been called a \u201ctraitor\u201d, told to \u201cleave the country\u201d and even to \u201cmove to North Korea\u201d on this forum, because I said that Churchill was brilliant wartime leader, but also a racist and an imperialist. Which is kind of funny, because I think Churchill would\u2019ve described himself as an Imperialist, and from what I\u2019ve read of him, was entirely comfortable discussing the inevitability of superior races dominating inferior ones. I\u2019m not judging him by modern standards, his statements and attitudes were controversial in his lifetime, and were not universally popular. He was, lest we forget, a failed politician in 1939, and after his war efforts, was voted out in 1945. He was not loved by all, even his legendary wartime speeches were ridiculed by many at the time. If we didn\u2019t insist on this ridiculous cult of personality around him, if we could view our history in a grown up way, then there\u2019d be no controversy. He wasn\u2019t a saint, nor was he the devil. He was a wartime hero but a peacetime failure. He was a racist who stood up against a genocidal maniac. We may wish to consider his achievements to be greater than his failures, but that doesn\u2019t make his failures unimportant. ",
