            "answer_text": "I started a business in Sri Lanka towards the end of the civil war, and even then it felt like a safe place to visit. The people are very friendly and the service you get anywhere is generally fantastic. Since the end of the war, tourism has boomed, and with good reason - it is a unique and exotic place to visit. Update 23 April 2019: No country is immune to terrorist acts. But you should feel no less safe in Sri Lanka than London or New York. Do not let the terrorists win. I haven't been to Sri Lanka for a couple of years, but I am damn well going now. ",
