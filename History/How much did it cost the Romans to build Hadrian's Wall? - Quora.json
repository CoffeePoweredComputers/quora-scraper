            "answer_text": "The wall took six years to complete and was built by two types of soldiers: Troops of three legions - inscriptions of the II Augusta, VI Victrix, and XX Valeria Legions have been found there - each of about five thousand men, along with their specialists: architects, mason builders, surveyors and carpenters.Auxilia posted to Britain: \u201cnon-citizen troops attached to the citizen legions by Augustus after his reorganisation of the Imperial Roman army from 30 BC.[1] By the 2nd century, the Auxilia contained the same number of infantry as the legions and, in addition, provided almost all of the Roman army's cavalry (especially light cavalry and archers) and more specialised troops. The auxilia thus represented three-fifths of Rome's regular land forces at that time.\u201dThey quarried the stone needed. Eight Roman inscriptions in the Roman quarry in Combcrag Wood, 350m south of Hadrian's Wall, Waterhead - 1014581 | Historic EnglandCawfields Roman Wall and Milecastle \u201cCawfields is a former quarry cutting dramatically through the Wall and the underlying Whin Sill dolerite bedrock. It comprises a large pond and car park with good walking access to Milecastle 42. A dramatic section of wall with land falling away in sheer crags to the north. The milecastle, probably built by the Second Legion, hangs on the edge.\u201d Roman soldiers' graffiti at Hadrian's Wall quarry to be recorded: So the actual cost to Hadrian would have been almost nothing, as he was already paying his troops.

            "answer_text": "The soldiers were getting paid anyway, whether they worked or not, and engineers were stationed with the troops. They may have had to pay locals to cut and haul the stones from a quarry. Probably the locals didn\u2019t get paid much per day, but there was an awful lot of stones to haul. It wasn\u2019t a burden for the Empire, for I\u2019ve never read anything about how costly it was. ",
