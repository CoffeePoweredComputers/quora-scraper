            "answer_text": "The evolution of \u2018butt muscles\u2019 gave early \u2018man\u2019 advantages navigating conflicts of interest with minimal cost to self. These muscles enable man run and throw efficiently, effectively, and with force. (Torque) Dr. Paul Bingham & Dr Joanna Souza discuss this at length in their lectures on human social and sexual evolution. People usually do not put up with stealing and other such behaviors, formal legal system or not. But non-human animals do. In other words, humans usually control and suppress conflicts of interest and non-human animals almost never do. The question is why? The answer is simple\u2014cost. It is too expensive for individual non-human animals to participate in control of conflicts of interest. In contrast, for humans, law enforcement is cheap and a good investment. It has become an innate natural behavior for us, one we usually take unconsciously for granted. How did this difference between humans and non-human animals come to be? The ancestors of the first humans evolved, inadvertently, the capacity to kill or injure conspecifics (members of their own species, fellow humans) from a substantial distance. These ancestors could kill remotely, from many body diameters away. This ability arose, in turn, from the evolution of human virtuosity at accurate, high-momentum throwing. No previous animal could reliably kill or injure conspecifics remotely. This novel physical virtuosity at throwing probably evolved at first as part of a local professional hunting or scavenging adaptation.* However, this elite throwing had unexpected, revolutionary implications for the evolutionary future of this new animal.1 This unprecedented remote killing capability permitted multiple individuals to simultaneously project violence at vastly lower cost than in any previously existing creature.\u2020 As we will see in Chapter 5, these reductions in cost are huge and highly significant. Thus, a radically new adaptive opportunity was inadvertently created. For the first time in the history of our planet, an animal came into existence who could suppress the conflicts of interest between non-kin (unrelated) conspecifics at low cost. \u201cLaw enforcement,\u201d thus, became a self- interested behavior for the original human individuals.
