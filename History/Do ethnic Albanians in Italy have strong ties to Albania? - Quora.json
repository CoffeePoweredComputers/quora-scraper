            "answer_text": "If you are asking about recent Albanian immigrants: like all immigrants of this world, some of them wanted to lose their identity so they haven't maintained a tie with their Country of origin. Others, remained themselves, they do visit their Country of origin (or the Country of their parents) often, they speak Albanian perfectly (like they speak Italian), they watch Albanian tv (like they watch Italian tv), they listen to Albanian music (like they listen to Italian music), they read Albanian newspapers (like they read Italian newspapers), etc. etc. I was born and raised in Italy. I learned Albanian by my parents (when I was young, they didn\u2019t answer me if I spoke Italian to them) and Italian by school, friends and society. I speak (think and dream) perfectly the two (in the two) languages. We have to say that the Italian society don't oblige you to lose your identity so those who were assimilated did it because they wanted. About Arbereshe people (the Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb are an Albanian ethnic and linguistic group in Southern Italy. They are the descendants of Albanian refugees, who fled from Albania between the fourteenth and eighteenth centuries): some of them maintained the language and the respect for their Albanian origin, others don\u2019t speak the language anymore but are aware of their Albanian origin and aren't afraid of it. We have to say also that many of them are completely assimilated. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two groups of Albanians in Italy: the albanian immigrants who moved to Italy in the 90's and the Arberesh. The former moved relatively recently to Italy so it's reasonable to believe they maintain strong ties to Albania. I find it more relevant to elaborate on the second case.  As you can see in the map above, there are some places in Italy with albanian speaking populations. This are the Arberesh, descendants of albanian refugees who fled the ottoman conquest of their homelands. They where the first to develope a conscience of ethnic identity among albanian speaking peoples. Therefore they where always looked with consideration by the founding fathers of the albanian national awakening. They also actively participated in that movement. For this contribution and the mere fact that they preserved with fervour their ethnic identity ( as opposed to the Arvanites of Greece) they are well respected and loved by the homeland albanians. They hold a special position in our national identity. They themselves are still today quite self aware and actively preserve their customs and identity. A lot of them visit Albania for a kind of \u201cnationalistic\u201d turism. They like to come to pay homage to their origins. They like to speak to people and proudly state who they are and where they come from. I\u2019am surprised how many Arberesh I came to meet in Albania (and young generation too). So, I would say, for the moment beeing they still preserve ties to their original homeland. ",
