            "answer_text": "The US was a nascent country under pressure from Britain, and France, its first ally and revolutionary republic, had excellent high-level relations cultivated by Thomas Jefferson who had been Minister for France where his ideas cross-pollinated with French Revolutionary thinkers\u2019. Due to the multiple wars and challenges facing then France, her leaders needed funds. With that and the fact that the land was indefensible, Jefferson convinced his French \u201callies\u201d that it would be best to \u201csell\u201d the land to the US for a relative pittance - if they did not, Britain or some faction would have simply taken it for free when France was battling several fronts in Europe. So, it was a case of, \u201cYou\u2019re down and in need of cash - better to have it go to a friend that risk losing it to arch enemy GB. Sorry, we are a young, poor country, can you not simply give us the land and we\u2019ll pay something for it, our dear friend and ally?\u201d Little did the French leaders know what a monster would be unleashed by that act. It opened up the West for \u201cYankees\u201d who eventually took over land from New Spain/Mexico that now constitutes about 20% of the continental US (California, N. Mexico, Arizona,Texas, Nevada, Utah and parts of Colorado etc.)  ",

            "answer_text": "France had been cash strapped for a century; it has not managed to build a viable currency at the time of the Mississipi bubble ( John Law scandal ), Louis XV lost a large part of his colonies after the Seven Years War, Louisiana which had been given to Louis XIV as an heritage after the death of the Habsburg Charles II was given back to Spain, Canada and India were given to Britain ( except Newfoundland and the Indian Comptoirs), what remained in the Bourbon empire was of course France itself, Newfoundland, seven Indian Comptoirs and Saint Domingue which a major sugar producer. The reforms of Louis XVI turned into a bloody revolution when the Assignat fell into hyperinflation, Law of Suspects comdamned to death everyone suspected of being a false monayeur, General maximum tried to limit by law price inflation, but because of the confusion created by the revolutionaires who abolished unilateraly and prematuraly slavery, Saint Domingue went revolutionaire and no one was able to retake it, Spain, Britain and France tried and it finally became Haiti. Revolutionaires and later Napoleon were very good at looting riches hoping supporting the currency, not only the french Bishoperies (Ev\u00each\u00e9s ) and the Noble Estates of the monarchic era but also the austrian Italy ( Napoleon used the Louvre as a personal cellar ), but an ultimate try to create a currency failed with the Promesse de mandat territorial So Napoleon regained Lousiana fom Spain certainly as a price to \u201cpacify Saint Domingue \u201cand despite the military fiasco he sold it for gold to America. What did Napoleon do with this Gold? it is not yet sure but what is the more probable is that Napoleon used it to reopen the port of Antwerp, previously located in the austrians low Lands Provinces, the harbor had been close for 150 years, this triggered the wrath of Britain, since Antwerp as a military harbor is a major threat for London.
