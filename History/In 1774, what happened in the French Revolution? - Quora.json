He had an enormous responsibility, as the government was deeply in debt, and resentment of \"despotic\" monarchy was on the rise. He felt himself woefully unqualified to resolve the situation. As king, Louis XVI focused primarily on religious freedom and foreign policy. While none doubted his intellectual ability to rule France, it was quite clear that, although raised as the Dauphin since 1765, he lacked firmness and decisiveness. His desire to be loved by his people is evident in the prefaces of many of his edicts that would often explain the nature and good intention of his actions as benefiting the people, such as reinstating the parlements. When questioned about his decision, he said, \"It may be considered politically unwise, but it seems to me to be the general wish and I want to be loved.\" [20] In spite of his indecisiveness, Louis XVI was determined to be a good king, stating that he \"must always consult public opinion; it is never wrong.\" [21] He therefore appointed an experienced advisor, Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ph\u00e9lypeaux, comte de Maurepas who, until his death in 1781, would take charge of many important ministerial functions. \"Le Couronnement de Louis XVI\", by Benjamin Duvivier, honoring the 11 June 1775 coronation of Louis XVI Among the major events of Louis XVI's reign was his signing of the Edict of Versailles, also known as the Edict of Tolerance, on 7 November 1787, which was registered in theparlement on 29 January 1788. Granting non-Roman Catholics \u2013 Huguenots and Lutherans, as well as Jews \u2013 civil and legal status in France and the legal right to practice their faiths, this edict effectively nullified the Edict of Fontainebleau that had been law for 102 years. The Edict of Versailles did not legally proclaim freedom of religion in France \u2013 this took two more years, with the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789 \u2013 however, it was an important step in eliminating religious tensions and it officially ended religious persecution within his realm. [22] Radical financial reforms by Turgot andMalesherbes angered the nobles and were blocked by the parlements who insisted that the King did not have the legal right to levy new taxes. So, in 1776, Turgot was dismissed and Malesherbes resigned, to be replaced byJacques Necker. Necker supported theAmerican Revolution, and he carried out a policy of taking out large international loans instead of raising taxes. He attempted to gain public favor in 1781 when he had published the first ever statement of the French Crown's expenses and accounts, the Compte rendu au roi. This allowed the people of France to view the king's accounts in modest surplus. [23] When this policy failed miserably, Louis dismissed him, and then replaced him in 1783 with Charles Alexandre de Calonne, who increased public spending to \"buy\" the country's way out of debt. Again this failed, so Louis convoked the Assembly of Notables in 1787 to discuss a revolutionary new fiscal reform proposed by Calonne. When the nobles were informed of the extent of the debt, they were shocked into rejecting the plan. After this, Louis XVI tried, along with his new Controller-General des finances, \u00c9tienne-Charles de Lom\u00e9nie de Brienne, to force theParlement de Paris to register the new laws and fiscal reforms. Upon the denial of the members of the Parlement, Louis XVI tried to use his absolute power to subjugate them by every means: enforcing in many occasions the registration of his reforms (6 August 1787, 19 November 1787, and 8 May 1788), exiling all Parlement magistrates to Troyes as a punishment on 15 August 1787, prohibiting six members from attending parliamentary sessions on 19 November, arresting two very important members of the Parlement, who opposed his reforms, on 6 May 1788, and even dissolving and depriving of all power theParlement, replacing it with a Plenary Court, on 8 May 1788. All of these measures and shows of royal power failed mainly for three reasons. First: the majority of the population stood in favor of the Parlement against the king, and thus continuously rebelled against him. Second: the monarchy was literally running out of money, in which case it would be incapable of sustaining its own imposed reforms. And third: although the king had as much absolute power as its predecessors, he lacked one crucial thing for absolutism to work properly: authority. Having become unpopular to both the commoners and the aristocracy, Louis XVI was therefore able to impose his decisions and reforms only for a very short periods of time, ranging from 2 to 4 months, before revoking them. As authority drifted from him and reforms were becoming necessary, there were increasingly loud calls for him to convoke theEstates-General, which had not met since 1614, at the beginning of the reign of Louis XIII. As a last-ditch attempt to get new monetary reforms approved, Louis XVI convoked the Estates-General on 8 August 1788, setting the date of their opening at 1 May 1789. With the convocation of the Estates-General, as in many other instances during his reign, Louis XVI placed his reputation and public image in the hands of those who were perhaps not as sensitive to the desires of the French population as he was. Because it had been so long since the Estates-General had been convened, there was some debate as to which procedures should be followed. Ultimately, the Parlement de Paris agreed that \"all traditional observances should be carefully maintained to avoid the impression that the Estates-General could make things up as it went along.\" Under this decision, the king agreed to retain many of the divisive customs which had been the norm in 1614 and before, but which were intolerable to a Third Estate buoyed by the recent proclamations of equality. For example, the First and Second Estates proceeded into the assembly wearing their finest garments, while the Third Estate was required to wear plain, oppressively somber black, an act of alienation that Louis XVI would likely have not condoned. He seemed to regard the deputies of the Estates-General with at least respect: in a wave of self-important patriotism, members of the Estates refused to remove their hats in the King's presence, so Louis removed his to them. [24] This convocation was one of the events that transformed the general economic and political malaise of the country into the French Revolution. In June 1789, the Third Estateunilaterally declared itself the National Assembly. Louis XVI's attempts to control it resulted in the Tennis Court Oath (serment du jeu de paume), on 20 June, the declaration of the National Constituent Assembly on 9 July, and eventually led to the storming of the Bastille on 14 July, which started the French Revolution.(Louis' \"diary\" entry for 14 July, the single word rien (nothing) has been used to show how out of touch with reality he was, but the document was a hunting log not a personal journal. When he did not go hunting, he wrote \"rien\", which did not mean that nothing important had happened that day). [25] Within three short months, the majority of the king's executive authority had been transferred to the elected representatives of the Nation. ",
