            "answer_text": "About 13,000 years ago in North America, a culture of big game hunters existed for several hundred years. Called the \"Clovis\" culture after the original discovery site in the (American) state of New Mexico, the Clovis people were masters of shaping exquisite stone blades (called Clovis points) which they hafted (attached) to spear or javelin shafts, probably using an innovative tool called an \"atlatl\" which greatly increased their throwing power.  We know the Clovis people hunted the biggest of game because several bones from Pliestocene (\"Ice Age\") megafauna like mastodon and gigantic bison have been discovered with Clovis points deeply embedded in large bones like scapula, ribs and femurs. The power to drive a stone point through thick hide, flesh and well into a massive bone records an ancient hunting event (or incident, if you will) requiring not only cooperation to hunt such massive animals, but the technological skill to both craft the Clovis points (very difficult even today) and the means to deploy them with the tremendous force needed to embed them deep into these long extinct creatures.  It is now widely believed by scientists that in just a few hundred years, the Clovis Culture either directly caused,  or greatly contributed to, the extinction of the Ice Age megafauna of North America - creatures like mammoths, mastodon, giant ground sloths,  giant camels and many others. All extinct. After about 500 years, all traces of the Clovis Culture vanished as mysteriously as it appeared... along with most of their megafauna prey.  The rib of a 13,000 year old mastodon with a Clovis Point embedded. In just a  few hundred years, most North American megafauna was wiped out.   The exquisitely worked Clovis points crafted some 13,000 years ago by the people of the Clovis Culture. They could be sharper than a modern scalpel and were designed to bring down giant Ice Age animals.  Estimated distribution of the Clovis people 13,000 years ago, with the pass through the ice sheet that gained them access to human-free North America (and its massive creatures) across the Bering Land Bridge from Asia.  Depiction of an atlatl spear/dart throwing tool. It provided tremendous leverage and imparted great force to the scalpel-sharp, Clovis tipped spears used by Clovis hunters.    Giant ground sloths were endemic to North and South America and were probably hunted by the Clovis people. ",

I did not fail to recognize the attempt of the so-called scholar from Princeton to do what christian apologist always do, to rewrite history to support christian assumption. Typical and, as always, poppycock. Well done to you, Jaime and thanks to Yash. ",
