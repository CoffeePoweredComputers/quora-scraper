            "answer_text": "The Koryo-saram of central Asia, Russia, and Ukraine number around 500000 total. The former Soviet Union was home to the world\u2019s third largest population of Koreans at one point! The Koryo-saram have lived in this area since the days of the Russian Empire. These Koreans have an interesting history, and throughout a century of isolation from other Koreans, have developed their own dialect of Korean and have their own customs. Below is a map I made of countries by the numbers of Koreans I few months ago. This data is compiled by the South Korean government. There are Koreans in nearly every country; the gray ones are the only ones without Koreans. Darker green means more Koreans.  This map shows how there are lots of ethnic Koreans in the regions mentioned in this question. In fact, the country with the world\u2019s largest percentage of Koreans outside of the two Koreas is Kazakhstan, where Koreans are estimated to make up 1% of the country now due to very high fertility rate. As for by numbers, then here are the five former Soviet Republics with the largest amount of Koreans: Uzbekistan (181077)Russia (169638)Kazakhstan (109133)Kyrgyzstan (19035)Ukraine (13070)Koreans are numerous enough in Uzbekistan that the second largest religious sect after Sunni Islam is the Korean Orthodox Church! Other sizable communities exist in Belarus and Turkmenistan. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Tajikistan have very few Koreans left; while Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia have almost none. So, where did the Koryo-saram come from?  A Korean family in the Kazakh SSR. In the late 19th century, a few thousand Koreans immigrated to the Russian Empire to escape the extreme wealth inequality that happened towards the end of the Joseon dynasty of Korea. The borders with China were sealed off, leaving Russia the only place that they could go to. They settled in Russia\u2019s Far East, forming a sizable community in Vladivostok. However, the majority remained farmers and went to the southern reaches of Siberia, where they actually outnumbered both ethnic Russians and natives in many cases! Immigration continued into the Russian Empire as thousands more Koreans saw economic opportunity. In 1910, Japan took control of Korea, and soon forced the Russian Empire to ban immigration from Korea; but the Bolshevik Revolution occurred soon after. Taking advantage of the instability, Korean immigration into Russia to escape the repressive rule of the Japanese increased. Koreans in Vladivostok formed a group to help bring more Koreans into Russia. By the time that the Soviet Union was formed, Koreans numbered 106817 in the 1924 census. After this, the Soviet Union restricted immigration from Korea, halting the growth of the Korean community. For a period of time, the Soviet Koreans of Russia\u2019s Far East had very good living standards. They had their own Korean schools and autonomous regions. But in the late 1930s, Joseph Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov feared that the Japanese had been using Soviet Koreans to infiltrate the Soviet Union. They signed a law in August 1937 and immediately enforced it. The Koreans were mass deported to the central Asian SSRs.  Koryo-Saram in a Korean Orthodox Church in Russia. Within three months, 176781 Koreans had been forcefully moved to central Asia. Despite the Soviet government promising them money and supplies to start new towns, the Koreans never got anything due to the ongoing World War II. A few thousand died in the brutally cold winter that followed. But, the tightly knit community of Koreans quickly recovered. They made use of what they had to build new communities. They built new irrigation systems and quickly became very successful. They actually brought large-scale rice farming to central Asia. This is what led to the foundation of the Koryo-saram cultural identity! Far away and isolated from their homes, the Koreans of central Asia banded together. Most were, unlike their counterparts in Korea, Orthodox Christian. Their language began changing. Their cuisine became different, utilising ingredients found in central Asia. They took new traditions. The Koryo-saram are quite different from other Koreans. Later on, a few moved around the Soviet Union, especially to Ukraine, and Russia still retained many Koreans. Because the Koryo-saram were almost entirely farmers, their fertility rates were high. By the fall of the Soviet Union, they numbered nearly 450000 despite almost no further immigration after 1931! Today, some Koryo-saram move to South Korea (though originally, more come from the north) to seek better employment, but the transition is difficult. Most remain in central Asia, Russia, and Ukraine, where many are still farmers, living in their traditional villages - with the exception of Kyrgyzstan, where almost all Koryo-saram live in the capital, Bishkek. My family has many Korean friends there! What is their culture like?  The above photo shows Koryo-saram in Kazakhstan! Because Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev runs the country on a basis of promoting all cultural traditions, the Koryo-saram preserve their traditions best here. Note how some of the Koreans in the above photo are mixed; two girls don\u2019t look very Korean, but they are descended from Koreans! Mixed Russians and Koreans are called \u0442\u0430\u0433\u0443\u0431\u044f (tagubya). In central Asia, Russia, and Ukraine, what the Koryo-saram are especially famous for are their food, dance, and music. Korean restaurants can be found in all major cities in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. One particular Korean dish that has become popular all over the the former Soviet Union is spicy Korean carrot salad, called \u041c\u043e\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c \u043f\u043e-\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438 (Korean-style carrot). It is a variation of kimchi, created with carrots because central Asia did not have the traditional form of cabbage used in kimchi! Below you can see this being sold in a market in Uzbekistan:  As for the dance part, when Japan repressed Korean traditions, the ones that fled to the Russian Empire wanted more than ever to preserve their traditions. The traditional style of Korean theatre still lives on in this part of the world. In fact, Kazakhstan has the world\u2019s first Korean theatre outside of Korea in Almaty. In the present day, K-Pop is very popular in all of these countries, but especially in central Asia. While this is likely unrelated to the Korean population in these countries, it may help. The Koryo-saram were also very renowned for being famous musicians in the former Soviet Union. Yuliy Kim is one of the Soviet Union\u2019s most famous composers and singers, also starring in many movies. Viktor Tsoi cofounded Kino, a band that is popular to this day in Russia and even outside of it. Below is a traditional Korean dance being performed at a dance hall in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan! These displays are adored for their elegance and beauty:  Another interesting aspect of the Koryo-saram is how the majority belong to the Korean Orthodox Church, which has almost no members in Korea itself. This is because the Orthodox Church, while overall heavily restricted in the Soviet Union, was the church with the fewest restrictions places on it by far. Some of the Koryo-saram have also converted to Islam, especially in Uzbekistan, whether due to being encouraged to after marriage or simply by choice, but the vast majority are still Christian. In Seoul, a family of Koryo-saram from Kyrgyzstan have a restaurant that serves Kyrgyz food. Above the restaurant is a Koryo-saram Orthodox Church with services in the Russian language. You can see this below:  Most Koryo-saram speak Russian natively; the exception is in Kazakhstan, where the government has many resources for learning Koryo-mar, the dialect that they speak. Speakers of this dialect find it difficult to understand other Korean speakers, and vice-versa. Koryo-mar, usually not written (though both Cyrillic and Hangul variations exist), has a simple tone system based on pitch, and drops lots of word endings. This is not present in standard Korean. The surnames of the Koryo-saram are altered for pronunciation in Russian. Because some of them were too short for the Russian government, many added the suffix -gay to their surnames, which means family in Korean. Here are just a few common surnames of Koryo-saram:  These are just a few of the unique traditions that the Koryo-saram have. The Koryo-saram have been quite influential, especially in central Asia. Many are politicians. Their culture is renowned all over the region. Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev has lauded the Koryo-saram for their commitment to family ties, education for children, and how they, when deported, quickly rebuilt by working together. One of the highest titles of Kazakhstan is the Hero of Labour, granted to people who help the development of Kazakhstan, to which Koryo-saram have been disproportionately awarded. The culture and history of the Koryo-saram is truly amazing! Here is a final interesting point made by a reddit user on r/Korea, which provides a perspective from a South Korean view of how the Koryo-saram in South Korea are like. Thank you, EkoKorean, whoever you are:  - Presently, many Korean business(wo)men are arriving in rapidly developing Kazakhstan, encouraged by the large number of Koreans living there. This is also beginning to happen in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan as both countries start to develop. Koryo-saram in all countries are beginning to reconnect more and more with their heritage, meaning that as their numbers grow in the future, more will have the unique culture that they follow! Thank you for your request, Thomas Yom. I hope that this is interesting not just to me! I also thank Alexey Tereshchenko for some further suggestions to detail the culture of Koryo-saram more! ",
