            "answer_text": "The one who did the most damage to the Dark Ages-era Roman Empire was none other than Justinian himself. He had Italy invaded just for the sake of taking Rome, this time being the imperial namesake second capital but already far more impoverished than even the second-tier cities within the empire thanks to past barbarian invasions and sackings, and as a result the peninsula ended up being far more impoverished than ever, completely losing its cosmopolitan character that the governing Goths had ironically tried so hard to maintain and becoming a rural backwater for centuries until the early modern era. He wasted a very huge chunk of imperial treasury in this senseless campaign, and that could have been used instead in improving the lot of its poor peasants across the empire or at least improve their military network as to properly counter external and internal threats in the future. He had the Roman North Africa and parts of Spain reconquered, but then again at the cost of so much, both blood and money. Rebellions occurred in reconquered North Africa, and although they were quelled, the region became more of an economic chaos and a useless liability rather than a significant imperial asset. He and his empire lost two wars against the Persian Empire and ended up paying a fairly huge annual tribute to the Persian king, therefore putting an even more severe strain to the already severely depleted imperial treasury, and taxing its already destitute peasants even more to make ends meet. The result of his wasteful policies was he was hated almost everywhere he goes in the empire, and his sacking of his best general Flavius Belisarius for bullcrap reasons and his cuddling of two of his ministers, who are some of the most corrupt the empire has ever yet seen, didn\u2019t help either. Near the end of his reign the economy of his empire was in almost total shambles, having been exhausted by his senseless military campaigns. His deeds, while it resulted in the enlargement of the post-476 AD Roman Empire, only served to further weaken it. In the future, the consequences of his actions would be disastrous. ",

            "answer_text": "Phokas. As the 7th century dawned, the Byzantine Empire was slowly recovering from the horrors and devastation of the 540s and 550s. A competent and very underrated ruler, Emperor Maurice, had beaten back Avar and Slav encroachment, dragged the economy back from the brink, and made a mutually beneficial peace with the Persians, who were indebted to him after he restored their Shah to the throne. And then this Phokas prick rises up with the army of the Balkans, takes it off the Danube Frontier, marches to Constantinople, and cuts Maurice\u2019s head off. This ruined basically everything. Phokas was an opportunistic demagogue through and through, always riding waves of popular sentiment and using them to gain favors and power. He lowered taxes by a significant amount, which gained favor with the people, but was heavily damaging to the Roman economy in the long term. During Phokas\u2019 lovely little trip to Constantinople, the remaining garrison left manning the Danube River was pitiful, and the Avars and Slavs once again saw an opportunity. They crossed the river before Phokas could finish throwing lavish parties and drinking to celebrate his success, undoing all of Maurice\u2019s hard-won gains of the 590s. It was the last time the Roman Empire would extend to the Danube River for over 400 years. The Persian Shah Khosrau II observed these events carefully. Maurice had been his patron, and Maurice was the reason Khosrau was sitting on his throne. And now this low-born army officer has unceremoniously beheaded him? No, this wouldn\u2019t do. Khosrau had to avenge Maurice\u2019s death, and preserve his legacy. And also, taking Syria and Egypt while he was at it would be a nice bonus, if you catch my drift. Before Phokas had even gotten over his hangover, the Roman Empire was beset from two fronts by two foes who, just a few years ago, had not even been on the radar. The Roman governor of Mesopotamia revolted and sided with the Persians, giving Khosrau ample opportunity to push on and take crucial Roman forts like Dara. The grind through the Roman frontier defenses was a slow one, but the Persians were able to get through due to the clumsy and lackluster response of Phokas. Army after army was defeated, and city after city was taken. The Balkans were in chaos, the East was collapsing, and Phokas was trapped in the middle. Enter Heraclius. And the other Heraclius. Father and son, they were both named Heraclius. They governed the Imperial Exarchate of Africa, and they observed the worsening situation of the Empire with growing dread and a sense of duty. Unable to do anything while stuck in Carthage, the two raised the banner of revolt against the ineffectual Phokas in 608, capturing Egypt the year after. In 610, the Heracliuses (Heraclii?) had consolidated their strength enough to launch a full-scale naval assault on Constantinople. The main Roman armies were too busy trying to hold back the Persians and Avars to defend their Emperor. Phokas, likely having given up at this point, didn\u2019t put up much of a fight, and was handed in chains to the younger Heraclius, who was to ascend to the throne. Before Phokas was executed, Heraclius asked of him this: Is it thus that you have governed the Empire? Phokas responded: Will you govern it any better? Phokas\u2019 body would rise up into the sky as ashes after being burnt to a crisp by an angry mob. The death of Maurice had finally been avenged, but the damage had already been done. Here\u2019s a list of Phokas\u2019 accomplishments: Left the Danube Frontier nearly ungarrisoned, undoing all of his predecessor\u2019s hard work to drive the Avars and Slavs back. Basically ceding the Balkans for four centuries.Pissing off the Persians, starting a 26 year long war that would devastate both Empires, leaving them drained of the manpower and resources they would have needed to face the Arab invasions.Blundering away all of the Roman defensive forts along the Euphrates River, leaving their Eastern provinces open to Persian assault.Hurting the economy long term with huge tax cuts for the purposes of winning the favor of the people for a short while.Killing a competent and able ruler that had helped the Roman Empire recover from its losses because he was an opportunistic little cuck.Regarding Phokas\u2019 last words\u2026 you would be hard-pressed to find an Emperor who didn\u2019t govern the Roman Empire better than Phokas.  Roman Empire in 600 CE.  Roman Empire in 650. Thanks, Phokas. *claps* ",
