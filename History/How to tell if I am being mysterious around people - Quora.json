            "answer_text": "I think I can answer that question. People call me \"mysterious\" all the time and since I am practiced at the art of self-reflection I might provide you some valuable insight: When people call you mysterious it basically means two things: 1.) that you don't divulge much information about your personal life/are very secretive 2.) that people would like to know you better but can't because you refuse to cater to their personal needs p.s. you may think that being mysterious sounds really \"cool\" but in reality it has a negative connotation attached to it (those are usually the first people to get questioned when things happen). Unless you're famous of course, in that case it may have a positive connotation. Take e.g. Johnny Depp, he's mysterious and famous. Have a nice day. ",

            "answer_text": "i  honestly believe  people judge others more on actions words subtext and whatnot less \"auras\"... and like others here have said of course you don't seem a mystery to yourself you know you and also if they say they believe you a mystery it is likely because you don't talk much about your personal life or perhaps people find your emotions hard to read or they find you're not very expressive at all which i believe is not really a bad thing unless someone is truly curious about your life or how you feel...
