            "answer_text": "Until the end of WWI, most of German power was held by kaisers (just as Russian power was held by czars). In regards to Germany, the last holdout (in regards to kaisers) was Wilhelm II (who would not relinquish claims to authority). Czar Nicholas II was forced out with the Russian revolution. The aspect of identifying things as specifically Jewish happened with two issues. Jewish people in Germany were no different than their gentile counterparts. From capitalist to communist, merchant to farmer, etc. From Hitler\u2019s use of \u201cJewish\u201d his focus was on communists and bankers. When Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, there were four principal \u201cleaders\u201d of the communist movement (prior to Stalin manipulating absolute dominance). They were Joseph Stalin, Lev Kamenev, Grigory Zinoviev, and Leon Trotsky. Trotsky was very involved with numerous revolts in Europe (if not personally, verbally projecting support). Within Germany, Kurt Eisner declared himself Prime Minister of Bavaria (which lasted a few months). When Eisner was murdered, Hitler is (rumored) to have attended his funeral. One of Eisner\u2019s followers, Rosa Luxembourg, along with Karl Liebnecht led another communist uprising. They were part of a group called Spartakusbund(Sparatacus federation) [along with Leo Jogiches, Franz Mehring and Clara Zetkin - later controlled by Paul Levi]. There were, also, communists uprisings in the Finnish Civil War, Hungary and the Netherlands. Instead of just commenting on Communism, Hitler put emphasis on the communist, who happened to be Jewish (pretty much everyone mentioned above - except a few]. There were many conflicts between Hitler\u2019s group and the communist groups in Germany. The capitalist aspect, where Hitler focused on the \u201cJewishness\u201d of individuals was the banking industry. However, Hitler was not the only one to focus on the \u201cJewishness\u201d of what was happening in Germany. In New York, when Hitler gained power, he opened a fund which people could borrow from, without paying interest (\u201cusury\u201d). Within New York, this was being commented on as Hitler attacking the finances of the Jews (instead of attack on the banking institution). The international Jewish community fell into this interpretation and in March of 1933. the influence of this interpretation led to pursuing boycotts of German goods in other regional governments. When Hitler\u2019s government found out about this boycott (hard to miss, as the headline of the March 24, 1933 British Daily Express stated, \u201cJudea Declares War on Germany\u201d), they decided to have a boycott of Jewish goods in Germany on April 1, 1933. This is when they painted Yellow Star of Davids on the front of Jewish owned businesses, so nobody would shop there, that day. The German Jewish capitalists were not upset by this, as, although Jewish, their goods were [also]German. The international Jewish community did not let up on the boycott (to destroy the German economy), however nations started \u201cslacking off\u201d and things were getting better until the death of Ernst vom Rath by a young Jewish assassin. Before the German government got Herschel Grynszpan in custody (discovering the murder was the result of a \u201clover\u2019s spat\u201d), the German assumption was that the assassination of a German diplomat by a Jewish individual was just an extension of the Jewish boycott (after finding the truth, Ernst vom Rath went from a \u201chero\u201d to obscurity). The assassination of Ernst vom Rath (German diplomat) led to Kristallnacht. This would be the extent of Jewish influence into Germany\u2019s politics. Yes, Hitler was a supremacist egomaniac \u2026 but he was not the only one \u201cthrowing fuel on the fire\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "I get the question but I have a strong reaction to it. Why? Hatred and destruction of Jews was nearly always a thing across Europe. It\u2019s important that no matter who you are, you almost certainly scapegoat people. Sometimes you get it right, but if you\u2019re going to pretend like you never do, you\u2019re a dope. Worse than this, ethics, like science and technology, evolves over time. In fact, it\u2019s inextricable from our actual material science. You cannot have a moral code for long that gives you a competitive disadvantage in the world you live in. It\u2019s not unlike evolution \u2014 a quality only persists whilst it doesn\u2019t harm. (But it especially propagates if it does give a fertility advantage). Tribes since the dawn of time have upheld values we\u2019d adore today (love of life, reasonably good rights to women, anti-violent). Problem is, like the docile Tautaura, the moment you meet a competing tribe, you end up going extinct. There\u2019s a point to this. The morality we lean on is only granted by circumstance. You, as an individual, or as a nation, can certainly cling to a loving, pacifist morality, but the moment you meet a power greater than you that wants what you have, you either adapt, move, change the environment or die off. Change the environment, in this case, means \u201ckill the invaders\u201d. There have been Maori tribes in New Zealand were killed off brutally not by white men, but by other warlike Maori tribes. And this occurred within the historic record \u2014 one Maori tribe that believed in war and pillaging encountered the docile tribe and killed every single one of them. They went into the mountains and murdered their children, sparing not even a crying infant. All the great morals in history didn\u2019t amount to a hill of beans once an existential threat arrived. They couldn\u2019t run (nowhere to go), they refused or didn\u2019t have time to adapt, they couldn\u2019t change the environment (neutralizing the threat or erecting a wall), so they perished and so too did their values of kindness, generosity and peaceful coexistence. During times of need, our definition of \u201cour kind\u201d contracts. The thought experiment is the slow (but eventual) collapse of society. At first things start to get lean. In our small country town of just 3000 people, we band together. We pull our resources and try to get through it. But mom and dad start stockpiling things in the basement crawl space and dad unlocks the door to the old fallout shelter. Then the state breaks down and my cousins and aunts come in from Kansas while my dad\u2019s best bud from high school moves into the barn with his wife and daughter. Then things start to get hairy. Food starts to run out. Mom and dad haven\u2019t tapped into the secret supplies by they want their kids to get the food first. Over time, the definition of \u201cmy kind\u201d contracts because my material means to do more also have contracted. This is why people who think that it was ONLY (or mostly) people protesting in streets demanding change. Protests will never usher in change beyond the material means of that society. If tomorrow, all of the world would be thrown back 500 years in technology, do you really think you\u2019d see as many women doctors, engineers and whatnot? No. You wouldn\u2019t. The existential pressure would be: humans die at a rate of 50% before they\u2019re teenagers, so just to keep the population flat, you need every man/wife to have seven healthy children (but really more like 10 pregnancies). NOW, if somehow we preserved the knowledge of hygiene, it\u2019s reasonable that we\u2019d maintain a good chunk of our liberal values (women voting, etc.), but there\u2019s no way around the fact that you cannot have modern structures of life (that depend on significant energy capture to remain extant), if/when the means of producing that energy suddenly ends. If the energy we capture and convert to novel industries goes away, so too do the taxes that fund public schools and public hospitals. So too do the roads begin to crumble and then the child mortality rate goes up. Suddenly lots of hands on the farm become important and suddenly mom is pregnant 10 out of her 15 formative years, meaning she didn\u2019t get to go to college, she didn\u2019t get to run for city council and she didn\u2019t get to pursue that career in physics she wanted. She was making babies because without those babies, everybody dies and the farm goes under. This is why, people who think we make the future through force of will, ignore (usually all too conveniently) the need for their modern values to have a medium in which they can thrive. If they cannot, they die. Yes, we can maintain good human values. (i.e. \u2014 a throw back of 500 years doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s fair game to start enslaving Africans and invading the Spice Islands.) If the moral information itself didn\u2019t die out due to existential pressures (and moral information is a technological innovation like music, art and \u2014well\u2014 actual circuits and chemical explosives), then there is a chance for some morals to survive the societal change. This is why people forget that while the basis for moral information is inherited (\u2018right/wrong\u2019, doing good, showing love, having empathy) and biologically coded into us, It is always focused through the lens of the environment and how it molds us to lean on those values. If environmental pressures force you define \u201cmy kind\u201d (your tribe or extended family) as the only humans, suddenly invading a tribe living in South Island and exterminating them from existence is no more worse than slaughtering all the goats on the farm \u2014 they\u2019re animals (and this says nothing of our specious moral values around animal agony and how we inflict unimaginable suffering on them \u2014 quick, how many people care about that; bet future generations will look back on us the way we do slave owners and wife beaters, so let\u2019s not stand too haughtily on our high horses yet). And we aren\u2019t even to the point of the Jews yet. History in Europe before the 20th Century was the same history everybody else had: low education, little science, morals through religion, no social services, etc. It was a constant cycle of poverty for everybody but the industrial/aristocratic classes. The industrialists, kings and leaders weren\u2019t the antisemites. Some of them gave mouth service to it the way JFK gave lip service to good Christian values and fidelity. It can be something very different for a pleb to talk about religion than it is for a national leader \u2014 people love religion and need it. National leaders frequently invoke religious and biased sentiments to make their population feel better. (Go to England or Russia or the US or China and listen to the press releases from the government: \u201cThe great people of [Russia, Britain, America] will beat this Covid crisis. We have the best doctors and scientists on Earth in our state of the art labs all working around the \u2026 blah blah blah.\u201d) Leaders love to pull on those strings to \u201cunite\u201d a people. Those leaders didn\u2019t ever really love the jews but mostly didn\u2019t hate them with any degree comparable to the ignorant, hyper religious masses. Like a lot of leaders sowing the storm, they accidentally seed the whirlwind and they inevitably crash and burn when they instigate the most primitive behaviors in their people. I have no doubt that Hitler hated the Jews. Lots of people did \u2014 hating the Jews was a 1500 year game in Europe[1] He was a plebian nobody before he became a leader and he retained the biases of idiots who have no experience wielding power. He sowed the biggest whirlwind in human history \u2026 and lost. Hitler did that because the world was breaking down. Germany had gone from THE richest nation (or tied thereabouts) to one of horrible poverty. The reason you don\u2019t see \u2014say\u2014 Afghanistan doing that, but Germany and Japan did, is that you have to judge the current state in compared to the previous. Afghanistan has been a shit hole (and I use that word accepting that people will be annoyed by it, but from an afghani girl who served me my dinner months ago, to all the returning British and American troops \u2014 it is indeed a mindbogglingly terrible place to live for anybody but a Muslim man in some level of power) for millennia and the people only know that. But give people creature comforts and then take them away \u2026 and you get lazy scapegoating, bigotry, and the idiotic nonsense below that should be self-parody, but the poor simpletons are just being human and doing what most low-mental-function idiots do: [2]  People act out of desperation and lash out at scapegoats. The worse the times get, the worse they behave. They retract their definition of \u201cour kind\u201d to be people that is closer and closer to themselves, eventually contracting until it\u2019s only family that fits in that tribe. This is how Jews became popular \u201cothers\u201d: they were just different enough to garner the hatred of a scared and superstitious polity. Hatred and scapegoating of Jews goes back millennia, it\u2019s only after one hyper rich country collapsed, did the millennia of scapegoating of Jews along with one particularly hateful leadership cohort, along with some of the most advanced technology in history (at that point in time) did the holocaust happen. Most Germans in everyday life, hated the Jews no worse than the Poles or Russians (who all, during and after the war went out of their way to hurt Jews \u2014 especially those trying to move home and reclaim their old property). The horrible truth about Germany is that its historic mark of shame came about because our records are better today than they were 5000 years ago (if we could see the horrors of history, we\u2019d be more forgiving of Germany) and the technology that allowed them to rapidly scale up a process that all people, everywhere, had done or tried to do for a very long time. They deserve that shame, but let\u2019s not pretend they were much worse than anybody else.  [1] People chiming in with \u201cFuck Christianity\u201d or \u201cFuck Europe\u201d, no, fuck you. Christians aren\u2019t perfect and Christianity \u2014as a body of people\u2014 have behaved terribly. The Catholic Church, despite its flaws that I, a gay atheist, dislike, it did good for millennia for people, feeding them, caring to them and yes, teaching them good morality. The base hatreds in people are in all of us and has little to do with Christianity. I may not believe in the faith, but don\u2019t cherry pick its history out of context. The sundry churches have been the teacher, the exchequer giving money to science and art, it build hospitals and schools and tended to people in a world of unimaginable discomfort without which, the people would simply have invented one or converted to Islam, Roman Sun Worship or Zoroastrianism. Nobody knows, but religion is a far smaller problem than atheists try to claim. [2] Ugh. So, apropos of that! What a bunch of fucking morons. Yes, dipshits, a 2000 year old book is accurate today. Sweet Jeezis, the entire book of Revelation is a critique of Rome and it\u2019s treatment of Christians. Maybe it\u2019s been decided that it\u2019s a prediction of the end times, but don\u2019t go too far, all of its imagery is tied into how Rome persecuted Christians, especially the symbolism of 666, which explicitly requires you to stand before the beast and worship him. It\u2019s symbolism of having to make sacrifices to the Roman Emperors as deities which they saw as co-equal with the Christian god. It\u2019s also important to see religion the way the Romans did \u2014 to be Roman meant to be ENTIRELY ROMAN. To be Roman was to worship the Roman gods. A god had to be tied to a people or a place. But Christianity was an idea that spread like a virus. It called for a type of justice, anti-slavery, equality of people and anti-patriotism that shocked Romana. (Early Christians would find little in common with the state worshipers in Russia and the US: chanting state worshiping songs, pledges of allegiance that early Christians died refusing to say, love sacred places and statues of revered figures.) Such beliefs were alien to Rome and a real threat to the empire. The Romans \u2014just like about everybody back then\u2014 didn\u2019t have a name for their religion because, as I said, to be a Roman was to keep the \u201cmas maiorum\u201d (the way [\u2026of the gods, the ancestors]). It\u2019s no wonder that if you look at most ancient religions, they are named \u201cus\u201d [or whatever name we call ourselves] or \u201cthe way\u201d or \u201cthe path\u201d or \u201cthe custom\u201d (see: Daoism, Shintoism which are \u201cthe way\u201d; to Judaism which comes from \u201cto worship\u201d (i.e. \u2014 the way we worship Jehovah]; to Judaism (again), Hinduism and Romanism \u2014 the names for themselves which were inextricable from the religion at that time). To be Jewish isn\u2019t just a culture, right? To be Jewish is to \u2026 well \u2026 keep the Jewish customs and worship the Jewish God. The Romans were flummoxed, \u201cWait, you\u2019re a Roman but how can you be one when you do not keep the Roman religion?\u201d Religion was a big deal then (just look at Christianity and all the lives lost in its name to understand how people treat religion). Don\u2019t be too harsh on the Romans as if Christians were so much better. They weren\u2019t. They did a lot of necessary good for which I love the religion, but don\u2019t pretend like the Roman treatment of Christians is something unheard of in history. See: the Christian treatment of Jews.
