            "answer_text": "Yes. I\u2019ve survived more than one life or death situation. I\u2019ll describe two here. I sort-of-remember describing the first one somewhere else in Quora: I hope I\u2019m not imagining that I wrote about that one somewhere else in Quora; my memories can be perfectly detailed for some and, for others, forgotten. 67.5mph 108.3kph ute with two passengers. Summer rain; 18 miles 29k\u2019s West of Kalgoorlie Western Australia. S-bend January 1969. Notice hidden by trees. Skid; correct-the-skid by turning into it; get some steering back; miss a huge white tree; hit a gigantic wooden communications pole; wake up together all saying \u201care you ok\u201d; walk outside; lots of people fixing the only wired communications between Western Australia in January 1969; the person we talked to dismissed us like they wanted to just ignore us; we hitched to hospital; everybody ok as if nothing happened except blood everywhere in the car and things smashed in the tray behind the cab. The stump of the pole was jumped; we had slid about 30 paces past the stump into the bushes. We hitched into Kalgoorlie hospital; I was the last to get a ride because the other two were bleeding lots from their heads (razor-like cuts from the forehead to the back; otherwise nothing) and I had only a dent just above my nose. That incident has lived with me almost every day since 1969; as fresh as if it was yesterday. Another was when I nearly drowned because of my habit of swimming until too tired to swim out to sea then body-surfing back but, that time, there was an undertow \u201crip\u201d and when I turned around to go back no waves were there to push me back to shore. The beach looked like an island far away and the waves just bounced me up and down. So I had to do a chi thing and breath and pray to keep my faith that I\u2019m here for a purpose like I affirmed my life is not over and I trust, therefore, I\u2019m going to live. So I got to the beach almost unable to walk and went to sleep in the sand. I woke up to see a crowd watching two people also stuck, by the rip. They\u2019d got into a pocket because one was young and one was older and the young one had got the older one into the rock-sheltered pocket. Many of the others had also been stuck in the rip to some extent (all good swimmers; I was the only one to push out full-speed and get caught a long way off so the others would have swum parallel to the shore then back to shore).Anyway my attitude was to just pull the people out so I swam to them, got to the sheltered place and asked the younger man \u201care you ok\u201d and he said \u201cno\u201d so I got him to give the older man to me (to hold his head out of the water) and the young man swam to the edge of the rocks and the others pulled him out of the water (no way could I get somebody that far). While foot paddling I used one had to hold the person\u2019s head above water and the other hand to paddle the water (side-to-side horizontally with my hand at an angle). A lady who had asthma risked her life by rushing a long way up the beach to get a couple of surfers to fish us out using their surf-boards, the older man before me. I couldn\u2019t move; somehow my rescuer got me to shore. My life-or-death situation (in this second one) was that when I was on my back in the sand, again, I couldn\u2019t see anything except light; I was told I was blue. Anyway, a long hot shower later and a brandy was nice and everybody (it was a Christian youth-camp thing) gathering around me was wonderfully ok. Very nice experiences afterwards: The father of the young man (the one I told to go and be saved by the people on the edge of the rocks) thanked me for saving his son\u2019s life. The younger man was pulled out; I couldn\u2019t move sideways because the person I was caring for needed a technique I didn\u2019t know for keeping a person\u2019s head above the little waves while moving towards the rocky shore; perhaps there is one but all I did was concentrate on keeping his head above water as I told him to totally relax like hypnotic. The older person spent two weeks in intensive care because he had a heart condition (and was fine after that) so I know strongly instinct works as I knew he couldn\u2019t take any exertion. Anyway, the incident was forgotten \u2014 we\u2019ve never talked about it yet most of us grew up together \u2014 and we were all ok. Had the young lady (who had asthma) not run seriously fast enough, up the beach, to get help, I would have passed out holding the other person\u2019s head above the little waves (I sensed he needed that \u2014 to totally relax and not worry) until I passed out. I was pulled onto the surf-board to wake up into a bright dream-like not-real thing, a very bright-light place, seeing more and more normally until I was under a gloriously hot shower; and it was fun. I survived because people who could help, with what they could do, did. They went to the rocks and got the young man to come to them after I relieved him (as he was in a bad way) . An angel lady ran up the beach to get help from surfers who paddled, on the surface (the rip is below the surface) and rescued first the older man and then, with difficulty, me, just as I was passing out (I remember him giving me admonishments to get onto the board and me saying I couldn\u2019t move anything). Aside from the two here, I\u2019ve been in countless situations where the outcome would have been fatal yet was not. Near misses, on the road, could be listed and described in detail as they often get relived as if they happened just a few minutes ago. Such life and death situations, survived, have a peculiar place in memory as if time doesn\u2019t affect such memories. Other memories just get forgotten; I\u2019ve a few which don\u2019t fade. Thanks for the question. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I have been close to death twice. Once on a whitewater rafting trip where we smashed up on a rock and I was thrown into a waterfall which kept sucking me under, and the second was to rescue my dog and I swam at least the length of a football field with him on my back and made it20 feet from the boat ramp and just gassed out. My buddy saved my life\u2014no life jacket was on, as we were not boating or swimming-but I went in. They told me I was a dusky purple all over from lack of oxygen. On the rafting trip, I did have a life jacket, but the waterfall was too powerful. I kept swimming to the surface, grabbed a breath and got sucked under like that several times until it kicked me out. A kayaker came to help and screamed at me to put my feet up, and another raft came over the waterfall and hit into me and the kayaker. We both went under and my feet bounced off a rock that could have been my head! He rolled upright and took me by a rope on the front of the kayak to the shallows where my friend was kneeling in the water pitifully calling for help. I lost my glasses and couldn\u2019t see a thing. but had a paddle thrown at me and finished the trip! ",

            "answer_text": "Yeah I have, actually. Back in 2008, my friends and I were Kandy kids. We just got done pulling an all-nighter at our annual rave The Electric Daisy Carnival. From 4pm to 8am in the morning. We then went to an afterparty at some hotel in downtown Los Angeles. After that, we were on our way home on the 101. Well, after popping so much ecstacy, my body was tired. I scanned everyone in the car, Apollo of them knocked out. Man, sleep never sounded so good. As I put my eyes back on the road, I asked someone else if they could take over and drive. So I started to pull over..as I was braking, I noticed I wasnt slowing down. The car started to rumble. The rumbling got worse, and all of a sudden \u2026 I snapped out of my DREAM! I had fallen asleep at the wheel, and I was driving 90\u2013100 miles/hr in the emergency lane full of gravel and debris on the left hand side. My brakes weren't working, and I don't know what the hell happened but I went into a mode that felt like an out of body experience. I called it the Tokyo Drift mode, as i gained full consciousness and somehow knew what to do in all the panic. I pulled the emergency brake on and held onto the steering wheel, causing the car to spin out twice, raising a sand storm that blocked out the sun. All I could see was everything in slow motion. No screams, no tires screeching. nothing. Silence. When the car stopped, we were facing traffic, and we were all alive. a huge truck pulled up in front of us and asked if we were alright. I just nodded, and he said we were lucky we survived that, without hitting anyone else! My car died, but still managed to turn on after a couple tries. I got back on the road so fast before the cops came. My heart was racing a mile a minute. We were on the busiest highways and I didn't hit anything or anyone. I was so lucky, I didn't kill myself or my friends, and I had to say that was the scariest time of my life. I learned to never jeopardize my friends like that again, and so if I'm tired I pull over and sleep, rather than run that risk again. Thanks guardian angel, you saved our lives. ",

            "answer_text": "I was visiting the Rif mountains in Morocco, center of hash production and scene of a guerilla war 20 years previous. We were in camping Azilane, walk 10 minutes out of the back of the campsite, you were escorted by rifle carrying local militia for the rest of your journey. We met some German guys cycling south through Africa, already in morocco, their first stop, they were robbed for their passports, money and equipment. One day we climbed up the neighbour of the big mountain next to town, the name escapes me\u2026We reached around 500m altitude, decided to descend with no equipment. Let\u2019s say I tripped on some scrub and fell around 90 metres down the mountain, sliding on my ass, flipping over cacti like bushes. I managed to escape with only a broken wrist and not needing any medical treatment, like a samu. I realised then how easily we can become a statistic, or just a number. When your own mortality stares you in the face, you always learn something about yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, more than once. When I was eight years old, a man tried to drown me. He did not succeed because I had a tight grip even back them and I nearly twisted his nuts off. Almost a year later, a man in a maroon station wagon attempted to kidnap me. I screamed \u201cFIRE\u201d until people started coming out of their houses and he took off. I and my friend Barbie ran in the other direction. Another time when I was very young I was trapped in an amusement ride in South Florida heat for far too long, but my older brother was brilliant and made sure I got rehydrated immediately. I once almost careened my car into freezing water because it wouldn\u2019t make it up the steep hill and I had to keep my wits about me to avoid an icy death. Another time my spouse and I were chased down by some good-ol-boys because of my Queer Pride sticker on my car. We ran to a police station and the cop was trained well enough to know it wasn\u2019t all in my head (the 1990s were hostile towards LGBTQ people, don\u2019t be fooled). So yeah, I\u2019ve been in a few, and I\u2019ve made it out. Those are just the ones I can recall right away. I\u2019ve got more, but can\u2019t think of them right now. They\u2019ll come to me eventually. They always do. ",
