            "answer_text": "Presentism versus Historicism. Do we see History as something to judge in our own time, or do we see it as something removed from today. Presentism is what we see when people tear down a statue. Its also there when we look at the past to understand problems in our present, asking historical questions based on topics that are contemporary issues. (This can be useful, and a healthy amount is good, it means that we are applying history. Too much, however, and we lose a real sense of history for imposing our own views on the past.) This produces, at its extreme, history that doesn\u2019t inform the present by reflecting on the past (that is healthy presentism) but rather History that imposes current views on the past. No learning happens when we seek to impose our views on the past. Viewing the past as in the past (Historicism), however, reduces history to something that is good in itself but has little use outside of itself. It also ignores the way the past has currents that affect us today. Its the type of history that writes timid biographies that have no use other than reading out of personal interest. No applicable learning happens when we treat the past as a separate entity to the present. ",

I've also really enjoyed asking myself about the role of great individuals and whether they were actually 'great\u2019 or 'terrible\u2019 e.g. Napoleon Bonaparte, Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar etc. I also co-built a website for debate http://www.contendr.io If you think if any others please add then there and I'll be sure to have my say :) ",
