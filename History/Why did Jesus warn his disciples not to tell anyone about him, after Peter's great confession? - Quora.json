            "answer_text": "It is what is called the \u201cMessianic Secret\u201d that is expressed most in the Gospel of Mark. What goes around comes around; according to the genealogies, Jesus would have had a target on him from the time he was born because he was a descendant of Zadok the High Priest of David\u2019s time and David himself. (This through his ancestor King Jotham.) The prophecies of the Dead Sea Scrolls say that the great king that would come would be both priest and king in the line of David. Long after Jesus was resurrected, his relatives (nephews) were persecuted, called to Rome and crucified, including brothers James and Simon, and great nephews Zacharia and I think the other was Yahuda, according to historians. So Jesus himself told Peter, \u201cMy time has not yet come.\u201d And part of that time was his death, which he knew would happen just because of his ancestry and the fact that he was out in the open. He did not want to be taken before he got the message out. And remember, Satan entered Peter right afterward, who would be quite pleased if the disciples shot off their mouths in public - and of course Judas shot his off to the authorities. (Though when Josephus talks about Jesus\u2019 capture, he didn\u2019t mention Judas, only that \u201cthe Jewish\u201d leaders paid Pilate, this according to the Slavonic Version. ",

            "answer_text": "Not so much a warning , as a change of direction in the disciples thinking. At this time in Christs ministry , the disciples had little knowledge of Christs purpose , and Jesus didnt want them going out in society with half knowledge of His purpose He just wanted to get His real purpose fixed in their minds and hearts for the Job ahead of them read Foxes book of martyrs for the disciples purpose and work after Christ ascended Jesus gave them ( and us) the GREAT COMMISSION (removed from the NIV \u2014)in Mark 16- 15 to the end This is the ONLY place where the words of Christ are used ( often in red)\u2014and they have been REMOVED by the Lesbian translator Virginia Mollencott You can't get the true picture of anything by reading the NIV\u2014its 25% changed by homosexual ,Maarten Woodstra ( deceased ) and the lesbian ,mentioned NIV , printed by Zondervan ,owned by the worlds #1 porn pusher Rupert Murdock\u201425% changed , against Rev 22\u201319. \u2014also using BOGUS documents , Septuigent And Apocrapha Mathew 16 ,20 is for Peter and the disciples at that time in their learning experience NOT for us ",
