            "answer_text": "I would place my vote on the Lichtenstein (small, insignificant, country between Austria and Switzerland with a population of 35000) army during WW1\u2026 Why? Did they conquer a lot? Did they made a massive contribution during WW1? None of that. Not at all! But\u2026 basically all armies lose soldiers during war. During WW1 most countries lost a lot of soldiers! But not Lichtenstein my friends\u2026 No, not at all. During WW1 Lichtenstein send its massive army of 80 men to guard a Italian mountain pass. They did so successfully (without any needed action). On their way back home they befriended a Austrian soldier and decided he was now one of them. The army came back home with 81 men. During WW1 they grew with almost 1 percent while having an entirely successful campaign! Now\u2026 tell me what army accomplished this feat (slaves/war prisoners not accounted for)! Although\u2026 Seeing the track record of the Austrian army during world war 1 it's actually doubtful if the Austrian soldier was actually an upgrade. They did once had an entire shootout, turning in a massive battlefield, which turned out to be both Austrian squadrons fighting on the same side\u2026 Jeroen Van Leeuwen's answer to What are the most epic failures in history?

Of course, the generals/empires wouldn't have achieved so much without the powerful armies under their command. Here goes top ten in no particular order: The Persian army under Cyrus the GreatThe Macedonian army under Alexander the GreatThe army of Genghis KhanThe Roman armies under Julius Caesar and Augustus Caesar.The Grande Arm\u00e9e under Napoleon BonaparteThe Mughal armies under Babur, Akbar the Great and AurangzebThe Arab armies of the Rashidun Caliphate under Khalid ibn al-WaleedThe Britiash Aemy of Red Coats that created the British EmpireThe German WehrmachtThe Ottoman army with the Yeni\u00e7eri (Janissary) core",
