            "answer_text": "Bindusara's death in 272 BCE led to a war over succession. According to the Divyavadana, Bindusara wanted his elder son Susima to succeed him but Ashoka was supported by his father's ministers, who found Susima to be arrogant and disrespectful towards them. [27] A minister named Radhagupta seems to have played an important role in Ashoka's rise to the throne. The Ashokavadana recounts Radhagupta's offering of an old royal elephant to Ashoka for him to ride to the Garden of the Gold Pavilion where King Bindusara would determine his successor. Ashoka later got rid of the legitimate heir to the throne by tricking him into entering a pit filled with live coals. Radhagupta, according to the Ashokavadana, would later be appointed prime minister by Ashoka once he had gained the throne. The Dipavansa and Mahavansa refer to Ashoka's killing 99 of his brothers, sparing only one, named Vitashoka or Tissa, [5] although there is no clear proof about this incident (many such accounts are saturated with mythological elements). The coronation happened in 269 BCE, four years after his succession to the throne. [28 Source - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Ashoka\u2019s father Bindusara died in 272 BC from illness. Before dying he announced Sushima, Ashoka\u2019s elder half brother as the crown prince so he wanted Sushima to get crowned. However the ministers and Ashoka objected and while Sushima was in Takshashila, they didn\u2019t inform him of Bindusara\u2019s death and Ashoka captured Pataliputra and declared himself the emperor. When Sushima got to know about all this he rushed to Pataliputra with his 98 brothers and a civil war began which continued for 4 years. Ashoka killed 99 of his brothers including Sushima by tricking them into a burning coal pit and was officialy installed on the throne im 268 BC. ",
