            "answer_text": "Short answer: Religion Contrary to the popular media portrayal and other anti-historian sources the only reason the scientific revolution occurred was because of religion. I don\u2019t know how or why anti-religious people got such great control over the media and society to portray the opposite thoroughly debunked by historians always trying to force and impose their way and their fictional beliefs onto society. Cartoon shows and movies aren\u2019t necessarily historically accurate I can\u2019t believe people are so gullible to think so. Now onto exactly how religion caused the scientific revolution occur: The scientific revolution came from studying philosophy and astronomy..humans need food, water, and shelter for survival not philosophy and astronomy if there is no religion/form of government/organization/culture creating an artificial need to study astronomy and philosophy humans would never decide to study itThe scientific method is a form of logical empiricism that came from studying philosophy\u2026the reason why people were studying philosophy was because of religion not as portrayed in the delusional media \u201cafter gaining food, water, and shelter people felt like studying philosophy for no reason\u201dNewtonian physics is an advanced astronomical model\u2026Calculus was invented to solve astronomical problems the reason why Newton and others were studying astronomy was not as portrayed in the delusional media \u201cafter gaining food, water, and shelter people felt like studying astronomy for no reason\u201d it was specifically because the Church needed calendars and clocks so they were the biggest sponsor of astronomyConclusion religion caused the scientific revolution occur since religion caused people to intensely study astronomy and philosophyAnyone can easily falsify what I said by pointing out just one civilization in human history that decided to intensely study astronomy and philosophy without a religion/form of government/organization/culture creating an artificial need to. So where is it? Looks like it never happened ever even one time in ALL of human history. It\u2019s still the same in modern times\u2026if there is no religion/form of government/organization/culture creating an artificial need to study science then people won\u2019t naturally. Back in the Paleolithic times there was no religion that really existed humans just developed survival tools and went by survival instincts they didn\u2019t have any inquisitiveness, philosophy, or astronomy. Distinguishing between a religion vs. form of government/organization/culture is still a challenge in modern times (as there still is no scholarly consensus on what a religion really is)..it\u2019s nearly the same. I\u2019m still confused as to why so many anti-religious people are so intent on intentionally lying and portraying the opposite in the media and society always trying to force and impose their own beliefs onto society. There are many other myths in the media \u201clike science came from the Greeks\u201d when in reality all the Greeks did was pseudoscience and the historical evidence clearly shows that following Aristotle prevented the scientific revolution from occurring. The scientific revolution occurred when people abandoned following Aristotle. Almost everything the Greeks did was just pseudoscience and speculations. Other myths persist in the media like things about Galileo and heliocentricism\u2026in reality Galileo did not come close to showing heliocentricism as literally true the real reason why people believed in geocentricism was because we can all clearly see the Sun moving around the Earth with our own eyes, there was no way to distinguish geocentric vs. heliocentric models, and people insisted on following the Greeks who strongly supported geocentricism\u2026Galileo was really just guessing or speculating that heliocentricism must be true rather than proving. Still in modern times the geocentric model works fine for practical matters you don\u2019t need to invoke heliocentricism to explain anything. I took a History of Science course in college I can\u2019t believe that the media and society hoaxed people into believing ridiculous things thoroughly debunked by historians. It\u2019s disappointing that few mention the things I said about there being no built-in survival need to study philosophy and astronomy (which was what science is) meaning we can be around 100% certain that there would be no scientific revolution if there was no religion/form of government/organization/culture creating an artificial need to study astronomy and philosophy. I don\u2019t really hear anyone besides myself mention that how disappointing. That\u2019s got to be one of the easiest simplest things in the world to recognize I guess maybe too many people believe in free-will unlike myself so they never thought about a need existing and humans naturally being the same as other animals going by survival instincts.

            "answer_text": "It is an interesting question, and I don\u2019t think there will be a good answer because we don\u2019t know. The problem is that whatever you pick, it more or less happened similarly earlier but nothing happened. My guess is it was the Black Death that was the spark, together with the fact that sufficient was already in place. What happened was that everybody that could retreated to somewhere where they could isolate themselves, and one such person was one Isaac Newton. He had a whole lot of time on his hands so with nothing else to do, he thought, and much more deeply than most. He ended up coming up with what would sustain physics for centuries, and more to the point, his ego forced him to tell people what he had done because Leibniz was at the same stage. In my opinion, it almost took off with Aristotle. He invented the methodology for doing science, even if he was a little lazy and did not take his own advice on a couple of very important points (I wrote a novel about that, which shows where things went wrong.) Then, around the birth of Christ, there was another chance, because the Romans were very interested in engineering. In my opinion they faltered because they could not work out how to make reproducible small bolts (to join metal together). You might think Galileo started it, and of course Newton used his relativity, but until Newton came along, Galileo was somewhat ignored. So my vote goes to that which forced Newton to put his mind to physics and calculus - and that was what was probably the worst thing to strike Europe - the plague. ",
