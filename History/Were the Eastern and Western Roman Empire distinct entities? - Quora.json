            "answer_text": "For all intents and purposes; yes and no. Diocletian split the Empire in 285 AD taking the Eastern half as his, declaring the capital as Nicodema (modern-day Izmit, Turkey). He installed Maximian in the West, first as a Caesar under him and ultimately an Augustus to co-rule with him. Each were responsible for defending their half of the Empire, and with conflict from Gaul to Syria, Egypt to the Lower Danube, it was no easy feat. So as far as \u201cdistinct enitities\u201d having two different rulers is a clear indication that they were, but it's not that simple. The East was far richer, because of the trade routes from Asia into Asia Minor. It was more cosmopolitan and it was also more populous which meant more tax income. The West was developed but there was a lot of wilderness, especially outside the Italian peninsula (in Gaul, Britain, Iberia). As time went on culture changed and attitudes did as well. The West was Latin; the East, Greek. Citizens in the East still called themselves Romans, and there were strong attachments between the two. The West fell within 200 years after the split, and the East went on for another 1000 years after that, falling in 1453 to Turkish Conquest. The attachments mentioned before never completely faded away. An example of this is seen with later reconquests of \u201clost\u201d Roman territory. In the 6th century AD, Byzantine Emperor Justinian tried and succeeded in conquering lands lost to the Germanic tribes centuries prior, but these land grabs only lasted while he was Emperor. I know I've gone on somewhat of a tangent, as this isn't my area of expertise, but as far as I understand it, while they were culturally different and politically distinct, the Roman citizenry (both East & West) still believed they were countrymen.

            "answer_text": "No; that is a modern conceit. No one at the time considered Rome to be anything other than a single empire. Things were rough; there were barbarian and Persian invasions all over, and it was often too much for a single Emperor to handle. So an Emperor would appoint a co-Emperor to handle half of the Empire while the original Emperor handled the other half. This also solved the succession problem (as well as it ever was solved), since when one Emperor died the remaining Emperor (who was now running the whole Empire) usually still had the same problem (too much for one man to handle), so he would appoint a co-Emperor, and the process would start over. The eastern \u201chalf\u201d was stronger than the west, so the barbarians headed west (which was less defended). As a result Roman authority withered away in the west between about 400 and 600, although some western territory stayed \u201cRoman\u201d into the second millenium. Incidentally, the 476 date for the \u201cfall of Rome\u201d is a historians conceit, as is the term \u201cByzantium\u201d (which was coined in the 19th century). ",
