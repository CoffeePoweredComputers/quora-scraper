            "answer_text": "The British Empire has commercial, strategic and ethical roots. The Empire was not a force for good in terms of the moral universe we currently inhabit, but was fiercely justified by its creators on a number of ethical grounds (some of which were incompatible and led to internal conflict or were forced to evolve over time as moral norms changed in Europe). Nevertheless most of those who created the Empire genuinely believed they were a force for good. The discovery of the Americas and ready seaborne access to Asia coupled with world beating military technology created access to unlimited sources of raw materials and an enormous economic opportunity for all of the European powers - especially the maritime powers on the Atlantic seaboard. However much of the impetus for northern European settlement of the parts of North America and South Africa which had similar climates to northern Europe was also driven by a desire to create a protestant Christian utopia, especially after the failure of Oliver Cromwell\u2019a puritan regime in England to last beyond the 1650s. The plantation of Scottish puritans in Ireland (which created the modern Northern Irish protestant population), was mirrored in climatically temperate New England and South Africa in the 17th century. Settlement in the warmer southern Colonies of North America and the Caribbean was more commercially oriented, to produce agricultural products that could not be grown in Europe such as tobacco, sugar and especially cotton to feed the rapid expansion of the British economy. This was underpinned by the morally repugnant slave trade from West Africa and led to the establishment of trading posts along the West African coast and a colony at Sierra Leone. It was this latter model which dominated early rule in India too (minus slaves, as there was plenty of indentured labour to be had on the sub-continent), and in the absence of settlers, the London-based East India Company was subcontracted to pursue these aims ruthlessly on behalf of the Crown, recasting the Indian economy as a mass producer of cotton, tea, sugar, spices, hemp and sisal (Burma was later acquired principally as a \u2018rice bowl\u2019 to feed the growing but food insecure Indian urban population). Malaya was acquired to produce rubber and tin and Hong Kong to control the opium for tea trade from China. But the expansion of British global trade did not rely entirely upon the Imperial model. British businesses established dominance in many other, often themselves post-colonial, markets such as Brazil, Argentina, Greece, Spain and Portugal. This was achieved through political and military alliances (often backed up by loans or other forms of funding) or by providing support for independence movements in South America and the Ottoman Empire and then using maritime dominance to secure beneficial trade deals and squeeze out competitors. Strategic considerations to protect this commerce were also an important Empire building imperative. Competition between the European powers to secure and control these new sources of wealth was fierce and many colonies were acquired to protect these new possessions and the sealanes to and from them. South Africa had been settled by Dutch and French (Huguenot) protestants in the 17th century in the same way that New England had been settled by English puritans who wished to build a protestant utopia unsullied by European decadence. Britain acquired Cape Colony from the Dutch (then allied with Napoleon) during the Napoleonic wars because it provided strategic control of the sealanes to India before the Suez canal was built. Incompatibility between the idealistic mission of the Franco-Dutch boers and the commercial and strategic mission of the British would lead to the Great Trek of 1837, the founding of the Orange Free State and ultimately the Boer War and post-colonial Apartheid regime. Gibraltar and Malta enabled strategic control of the Mediterranean sea routes and access to the Atlantic (and thus most of the rest of the world) by mediterranean powers. Bermuda, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Hong Kong, Wai Hei Wai in northern China, the Falkland Islands, Mauritius, Fiji Islands, Egypt, Yemen and many other smaller possessions were also strategic acquisitions to control sealanes and provide safe harbours and dockyards and later coaling stations for the Royal Navy. A moral mission was present in the Imperial project too. The British Empire belonged to another ethical universe, one in which it was common to believe that Europeans had a moral responsibility to bring \u201cChristian Civilisation\u201d (to quote Churchill) to every corner of the globe. This moral justification for Empire was not confined to the British, it was used by Europeans and those of European descent to justify the acquisition, occupation and settlement of most of the territory of the Americas, Caribbean, and Oceania, and subsequently by the decedents of European settlers in North America, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, Southern, Northern and East Africa and throughout Central and South America. From the 16th to 19th centuries, politicians and intellectuals in European and settler communities rarely questioned the European moral duty (the so-called White man\u2019s burden) to administer \u2018noble savages\u2019 and consequent \u2018right to rule\u2019. The moral mission was subtly adjusted during the 19th and early 20th centuries, in response to an increasingly well educated European population schooled in enlightenment ideas of \u2018the rights of man\u2019 (and later women). Christian-led moral repugnance with the slave trade resulted in the justification for the Imperial mission changing to address \u2018barbarism\u2019 through the three \u2018Cs\u2019 of Civilisation, Christianity and Commerce during the 19th century. In the 20th century this morphed into a secular mission to bring \u2018rural development\u2019 to backward people (the latter remains a long term legacy of Empire - in the UK the Department for International Development, my former employer, is the direct descendent of the Colonial Office, which was set up in the 19th Century to ensure the moral administration of the Colonies). Another important innovation in administration of the Empire in the 19th Century was a cap on settlement. Aside from South Africa, Rhodesia and Kenya, European settlement was banned in most new Africa colonies, which were rebranded as protectorates, and was also heavily restricted in India and Burma. Movements also began to take hold in Canada and New Zealand and later Australia (albeit more slowly) to - in some limited way - acknowledge that indegenes had land and \u2018human\u2019 rights. This was tacit recognition that allowing European settlers to sequester land occupied by indigenous peoples had become a morally suspect practice. In much of Africa and India and the Pacific Islands a new model of \u2018indirect rule\u2019 through local potentates and \u2018chosen\u2019 tribes and chieftains took hold (a model pioneered by Fred Lugard in the Northwest Frontier of India - the modern borderlands between Afghanistan and Pakistan - and northern Nigeria). This began to replace settler rule, or rule by chartered commercial enterprises such as the East India and Royal Africa Companies from the 1850s across the Empire until the turn of the 20th century. Ironically, after WW1, it was the forces unleashed by British colonial policy that sowed the seeds for imperial decline. Some settler colonies were becoming economic powerhouses in their own right, and demanded self-determination (of course the USA had already split away in 1776). Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand achieved de-facto sovereign status as Dominions and Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong were developing into powerful self-governing regional economic hubs. In many other colonies philosophical, economic and political ideas forged in Europe such as nationalism, socialism and democracy were taken up by British educated indigenous elites, middle and urban working classes, leading to civil disobedience and armed insurrection in, for example, Sudan, India and Nigeria. In Ireland this was successful and (except for Ulster) the island became an independent nation. There were also divisions within the British political establishment and public opinion about the continuing moral and economic case for Empire. The Great Depression in the 20s and 30s affected global trade and made much of the Empire cash-negative, creating a financial burden on the exchequer. Simultaneously, as a consequence of the WW1 peace settlement, Britain acquired a raft of former German colonies in Africa and the South Pacific, and a whole new region of the former Ottoman empire in the mediterranean and Middle East. Although BP capitalised on oil fields around Basra and Mosul, these new mostly Arab colonies (Cyprus, Palestine, Transjordan, the Arabian peninsula and Gulf States, and (de facto) Iraq) had burgeoning independence movements and deep seated internal divisions and required significant additional resources to understand, administer and police effectively. At the same time Britain\u2019s 19th century industrial economy was ageing and becoming less competitive. Largely based on shipping, financial services, coal, steel, armaments, shipbuilding and textiles, it was being outcompeted in the new fast growing oil and gas, chemicals, machine tools, auto and aviation sectors by the USA, and the economies of other rival nations such as Germany and Japan were growing faster (indeed Germany had already outstripped the UK in industrial production before 1914). It can be argued that the commercial, strategic and moral writing was on the wall for the British Empire in the 1930s. WW2 accelerated that process dramatically. The legacy of the British Empire is difficult to judge on the shifting sands of ethics. It undoubtedly created a vast new political landscape and the foundation for great new nations such as the USA, Canada, Australia, India and South Africa. The English language became a global lingua franca and common law a cornerstone of international jurisprudence. Economic globalisation was undoubtedly accelerated by the European imperial projects and many colonies benefitted from an exchange of technology and infrastructure improvements although they were also forced to expatriate much of the consequent wealth to London. Yet imperial competition probably underpinned to some degree WW1 - and as a consequence WW2 - and probably served as a model for the Japanese imperial project in the Pacific in the 1930s and 40s, indirectly leading to great suffering globally. The legacy of the political model of colonial rule (which was essential military rule), perhaps created the context in which post-colonial military dictatorships quickly replaced democracy in the recent history of many former colonies such as Pakistan, Nigeria and Egypt. I have written extensively about how the ethnically-based indirect rule model can also be ascribed responsibly for the ethnonationalism which has led to conflict in many former British colonies such as Kenya, Zimbabwe, Myanmar and Cyprus, and hindered a lasting democratic settlement - although this is true of the former colonies of other European powers too. To sum up, the Empire was of its time and reflected the moral universe and economic and scientific and technological realities of the period. It was not a force for good when judged by current moral norms, but neither was it a pernicious enterprise when judged against the European ethical framework of the time (with perhaps the exception of its early reliance on the slave trade).

            "answer_text": "Like all things, it's nuanced, there were good things and bad. The british empire quite simply, made the modern world. It is quite simply impossible to be hyperbolic about the extent to which the industrial revolution changed humanities course. Practically all good things modern can be attributed to them, unfortunately, practically all bad things can be too. Just to provide some examples either way: Railway network- it used to be quicker to sail from Norfolk UK to Amsterdam Netherlands, than it was to ride from Norfolk to London. Now people could cross the entire country in a day. Caste system- the British exploited this to politically divide India, causing lasting social damage In contrast though, they ended some quite frankly disgusting practices, like the ritual suicide of widows. Economics- the modern banking system was a British idea, while politically controversial, it is absolutely essential in raising the funds necessary to keep a country solvent. Looting- Britain took cultural artifacts as spoils of war, and even now display them in museums in the UK (I must not be the only one to find it ironic that there is not a single exhibit from british history in the British museum) Preservation- in many cases, if the British hadnt taken them, they would have been lost to history. This is especially important regarding the Elgin marbels, which were being stolen for building materials by the Athenians who did not care about its historical importance at the time. Did the British empire do bad things? Yes Would it have been better if there was no british empire? No. Someone else would simply come along, and they were likely to be worse. At least the british had rules they would follow. ",
