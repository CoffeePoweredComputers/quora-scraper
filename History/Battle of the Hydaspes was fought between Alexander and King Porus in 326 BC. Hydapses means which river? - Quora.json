            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve got just the thing you need to answer all your questions regarding the modern names of the five rivers of the Punjab. The Hydaspes River is known today as the Jhelum River. After his victory over King Porus on the Hydaspes the two came to terms with Porus agreeing to serve as a vassal to Alexander. Before heading south down the Indus River Alexander teamed up with Porus\u2019s army to defeat a rival kingdom extending Porus\u2019s realm further east to the Hyphasis River known today as the Beas River ( which is actually a small tributary river). It was this act which brought Alexander\u2019s homesick Macedonians to a mutinous state where he wisely chose to sail south to the Indian Ocean which of course had no shortage of fun and adventure for our conquering hero to contend himself with in the coming months. Hope this helps!  ",
