            "answer_text": "Hannibal is considered a great strategist due to a myriad of reasons. Hannibal was the first general to take and sack Saguntum (a Roman town in modern-day Spain) that was considered impregnable and even visiting the site today it would seem nigh on impossible to take the town based on its defences and geographical position. After sacking an impregnable town, Hannibal led his army over the Alps which is also considered impossible, especially with elephants, but he did it and led his army into Cisalpine Gaul. Here, Hannibal\u2019s strategic ability really comes to the fore as he was able to unite an extremely diverse range of tribes from Nubians and Libyans to Carthaginians and Gauls into one elite fighting force. Hannibal at the River Trebia showed off just sheer tactical brilliance. Hannibal sent his Numidian cavalry, predominantly used to harass an enemy, across the river to attack Roman pickets and sentries. The Numidian cavalry then staged a fighting retreat back across the river in order to lure the Romans into staging a pitched battle on his terms. After an immensely tired and cold Roman force crossed the river, Hannibal sent his heavy Gaulish cavalry to smash through the much smaller Roman cavalry while allowing the Roman infantry to attack the centre of his line. The cavalry then was able to swing around and attack the Roman rear. The only way to escape for the Romans was to go forward and to smash through the Gaulish infantry at the centre of Hannibal\u2019s line which was the only reason why the defeat for the Romans at the Trebia was not as large-scale in terms of casualties as the battle of Cannae. Hannibal displayed his strategic genius again at the battle of Lake Trasimene where his masterful use of the geography and conditions was simply incredible. At this stage, Hannibal was effectively avoiding conflict with the Roman legions dogging his tail but when he passed through a narrow defile between an extremely steep hill, almost a cliff, and the shore of the lake he decided to plan an ambush. Hannibal set his Libyan phalanxes on the hill side just past the defile and his Gaulish infantry on the path while his cavalry, Numidian and Gaulish, were placed in such a position to prevent the escape of the Romans. On the morning of the ambush, there was a dense fog, which Hannibal had observed multiple times before coming off the lake, and used this to cover the positions of his troops. The Romans passed through the defile unsuspectingly and were ambushed by Hannibal\u2019s troops but the victory was again kept from being total by the Roman infantry breaking their way through the Gaulish infantry. But again, Hannibal\u2019s tactical brilliance ensured victory against a much larger army. But this wasn\u2019t the best Hannibal had to offer, that came at Cannae. At Cannae, Hannibal faced the largest Roman army ever assembled. It numbered over 90 000 legionaries. This was an open-pitched battle on the plain of Cannae, in open battle the legionary was seen as the ultimate and unbeatable soldier. This placed Hannibal in a situation where his strategic brilliance had to play a vital role in the outcome of the battle. Thus, Hannibal set his troops out in a crescent shape, with his Gauls at the centre closest to the Roman army and his Libyan phalanxes laid out either side of the Gauls each phalanx slightly further back than the one before, forming the crescent shape. Hannibal\u2019s cavalry was laid out on the flanks of his infantry and at this stage, Hannibal had no elephants left. Hannibal knew that the sheer weight of Roman numbers would force his centre back but his flanks, due to his superior cavalry would hold their position. Thus, when the Roman infantry attacked the Gaulish centre was forced back slowly which gave the illusion to the Romans that they were winning the battle but just before the Gauls broke and ran Hannibal is said to have taken a position in the centre of the line and prevented them from breaking and instead inspired them to hold their ground. At this stage of the battle, Hannibal\u2019s formation now resembled a V shape with his cavalry routing the Roman cavalry on the flanks and thus being able to swing around and encircle the Roman infantry. The Roman infantry was now trapped in this triangle of Carthaginian forces but unlike other battles where the Romans had been able to break through the Carthaginian infantry, the infantry on this occasion held strong. Thus, the Roman infantry was massacred and it is said that the killing only stopped when the Carthaginians grew tired of killing through pure exhaustion. This was the largest defeat Rome had taken and did take during its time as a Republic and an Empire. This, and I may be corrected here, was the largest number of people killed in a single battle up until World War I. These examples display Hannibal\u2019s strategic brilliance and sheer brilliance at that. However, and this is famously documented after Cannae Hannibal refused to march on Rome claiming that the Romans would surely surrender after Cannae and this is when one of his officers said: \u201cYou know how to win a battle, but you don\u2019t know how to win a war\u201d. This is probably the only sign of strategic frailty that Hannibal displays but it does not detract much from his sheer strategic mastery, arguably only matched by Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar.

            "answer_text": "He is not considered a great strategist. He was a superlative tactician and knew how to arrange and win many battles. But in terms of strategy, he wasn\u2019t so good. He went all the way to Italy, crossing the Alps, without a solid plan that would allow him to win. Then he won three major battles and still had no strategy for gaining overall victory. He just floundered. He could not be beaten in battle, but he could not win the war. Finally he had to retreat all the way to Africa where finally he met a superior tactician and lost it all. ",
