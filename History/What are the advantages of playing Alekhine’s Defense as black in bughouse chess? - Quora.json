            "answer_text": "1 e4 Nf6 is a great defence for black in bughouse chess, largely because 2 e5 can be countered with 2\u2026d5!  Yes, black brazenly sacrifices his knight on move two! Allow me to explain. Let\u2019s say white accepts the offered piece: 3\u2026exf6 exf6  In exchange for the knight, black has gained not only a tempo to establish a central foothold on d5, but also a key defensive pawn on f6. The f6 pawn makes it safe to castle and ensures that white\u2019s standard dark-square kingside attack (@e5/g5/h6 and eventually N@h6/f6) never gets off the ground. Black has a free and easy game; he can continue with \u2026Bb4, \u20260\u20130, \u2026Re8, \u2026Bg4, etc. This is a very instructive line. It shows that in bughouse, solid pawn structure, rapid development, initiative and king safety are more important than material considerations. (Just one caveat: make sure there is good flow on your partner\u2019s board, otherwise you may exchange all of your pieces too quickly and end up with nothing left!) Of course, white may opt for other continuations such as 2 Nc3, after which black has several options including 2\u2026e5, 2\u2026d5, and even 2\u2026Nc6. I won\u2019t try to cover everything, because that would take away the fun of bughouse! Instead I encourage you to improvise and try these lines out for yourself :) ",
