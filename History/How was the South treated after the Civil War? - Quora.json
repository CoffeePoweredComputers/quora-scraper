            "answer_text": "We need to break this down, Who in the south? There were four million slaves of African origin. They had been severely oppressed under a vicious, totalitarian regime. Towards the end of the civil war the war was converted into a war for the liberation of the black population, or so it seemed, with the Emancipation Proclamation, the black Union army regiments, the vast protest of hundreds of thousands of slaves and so on. So at the end of the war much of the former slave population believed that the lands of their former owners should be transferred to them. After all the southern elite had their lands and wealth through generations of stolen labor of people who were subjected to a racialized system of enslavement and disparagement. Although confiscated lands of rebel plantation owners had been collected by the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau for transfer to former slaves, this was sabotaged by President Andrew Johnson who gave the lands back to the former owners. The only way justice could have been done for the former slave population would have been if the lands and wealth of the slave owners had been stripped from them and transferred to the former slave population. Radical Republicans had proposed confiscating millions of acres of lands of the old planter class & transferring them in homesteads to former slaves & poor white anti-Confederate Union army veterans. For awhile during the administration of U.S. Grant the federal state protected the rights of the freed population with the presence of US troops and federal marshalls. These were used to suppress the violent terrorist gangs organized by members of the old southern elite \u2014 Ku Klux Klan, White Legion and so on. During that period an alliance of poor white farmers and workers with the black population elected the Republicans to office \u2014 a kind of farmer-labor reform party in the south that worked in the interests of the poorer part of the population. But this segment of southern society was abandoned by the northern elite after 1876. Gradually the black population, who worked in share-cropping, and many southern white small farmers fell increasingly into debt peonage that put them more at the mercy of the merchants and landowners. Debt peonage was advantageous to the plantation owning class as it kept their workforce in bondage. The elite didn\u2019t want them moving to the north or being employed by industrial employers. So this whole arrangement tended to retard economic development of the south. ",

            "answer_text": "Very badly. Lincoln said: With malice towards none and Charity towards all\u2026. He sought to bind up the wounds of the nation. Unfortunately for the South, Lincoln was assassinated just days after Lee surrendered to Grant, the few remaining brigades would soon follow, and the war was over. After that, many individuals and forces wanted to punish the South and make the South pay for the damages they caused. But the South could not pay. They fought to exhaustion. All money depleted. Huge loans unpaid. Cites, farms, and railroads destroyed \u2026even wiped off the map. Water polluted by rotting animals. No food, no seed and no planting for next year. The North offered federal programs \u201cto help\u201d. But many programs helped Northerners get rich at Southerner expense. The period was called \u201cReconstruction.\u201d But the Northerners became the owners, reaped the profits, and took over lands, farms, and industries. So called \u201cCarpet Baggers\u201d were reputedly poor Northerners, not even a decent suitcase, just a piece of carpet folded into a bag, and all their worldly possessions inside. But they had a little money, in a world with none. They could buy, build, or start farms, hotels, businesses, or industries for pennies on a dollar. And they became filthy rich. Even the new president, Johnson, who tried to help Southerners was so opposed that he became the first US president impeached by the House. (The Senate found him not guilty by one vote, and Johnson finished Lincoln\u2019s term.) For decades afterward, most Southern states elected Democrats, while Northern states mostly elected Republicans. What culture, manpower, and leverage the South once had was\u2026Gone with the Wind.
