            "answer_text": "He didn\u2019t \u201ctry to become emperor\u201d for a few reasons: There was not yet any such position as \u201cemperor.\u201d Nobody had held that kind of power in Rome since the ancient kings.Even Augustus was not called emperor. He knew that Rome would rebel against any such open desire for absolute power. He called himself \u201cFirst Citizen\u201d and deliberately dressed simply, kept a traditional house, etc., instead of cloaking himself in grandeur. This caution served him well. The position of a \u201csupreme leader\u201d was not one anybody openly aspired to for a very long time after Julius Caesar\u2019s assassination.Mark Antony did make aggressive plays for power, first in the Triumvirates and then through his alliance with Cleopatra. It is incorrect to assume that he simply didn\u2019t go after the ultimate prize. It\u2019s more that he (and other power players at that point) weren\u2019t yet sure what that ultimate prize would actually be.Mark Antony began stronger than Augustus, but Augustus managed to change that. Although not a brilliant military leader himself, Augustus had the strong loyalty of the great general Agrippa, with whom he\u2019d been friends since boyhood. Caesar\u2019s troops were even more loyal to Caesar\u2019s heir, Augustus, than they were to Caesar\u2019s friend, Antony. Furthermore, Augustus knew to pay the armies often and well. Although Octavian/Augustus was only 19 when he was thrown into this real-life \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d he had uncanny instincts for politics and learned quickly how to gain allies and consolidate power.Antony simply wasn\u2019t as smart as Augustus. By allying with Cleopatra, Marc Antony opened himself up to charges that he had abandoned Rome and Roman virtues, that he had become corrupted. His temper led him sometimes to make rash decisions that weakened his alliances and power while strengthening Augustus\u2019. Although Marc Antony was no fool and could be very shrewd, he lacked Augustus\u2019 extraordinary foresight and patience.",
