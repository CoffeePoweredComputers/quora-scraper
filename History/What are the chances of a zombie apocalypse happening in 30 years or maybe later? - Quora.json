So\u2026 after reading all of the other answers I feel that I must begin immediately to prepare for the impending zombie apocalypse\u2026. An interesting retooling of the \u201cI Am Legend\u201d Story with Will Smith portrayed a human created virus as the cause of the change in humans and that it invoked rabies like rage in the host (not a desire to eat living flesh) but simply rage which expressed itself as tearing, gnawing, and shredding those unaffected until they too were affected. An interesting sub plot element of that movie ( not from the original story) but it was scrapped by the studio was that in the end it was disclosed that Will Smith was the infected person and everyone else was trying to stop him\u2026. Think that would have made the movie much better and profoundly different from the version starring either Charlton Heston or Vincent Price. Returning to your question - Dead flesh cannot re- animate! There are no zombies\u2026 could a virus be discovered or created that did irrevocable damage to the concept of what it is to be human - Sure. As the ice melts in Antartica, Siberia, or Greenland it could expose a previous unseen pathogen\u2026. That\u2019s that start of a great story tying all our societal fears into one neat bow\u2026. \u201cMelting ice caps release a virus ( perhaps alien to earth) which then spreads like wild fire causing its victims to behave like zombies\u2026. It writes itself, and it is much more plausible than dead flesh coming back to life.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Julian Diep. I really like the ZA genre, both for entertainment and for its practical value. I read stories and books, watch the movies and play the games. With all that in mind\u2026 \u201cThe chances of a zombie apocalypse happening in 30 years or maybe later\u201d is\u2026nonexistent. Zero. Zip. Zilch. Regardless of how much my less than noble self might like the idea of popping a few zombie heads at 400 meters, it\u2019s not going to happen. I think I\u2019ll watch Night of the Living Dead, again. ",
