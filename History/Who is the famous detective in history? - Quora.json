            "answer_text": "What are some famous detectives? Real detectives are rarely famous. There are many fictional ones, with Sherlock probably being the best known, but also featuring in the famous league are Poirot, Morse, Wexford, Marlowe and Columbo, to name a few. Here's a link to famous fictional detectives. 30 Best Fictional Detectives However, this leaves famous real life detectives out completely. While murderers and cases can famous, there are relatively few famous detectives. I would suggest the most well known real life character was Frederick Abberline (1843 - 1929).  Abberline is, rather unfortunately, best remembered as the Chief Inspector who failed to catch Jack the Ripper, probably the most famous and one of the earliest recorded serial killers (assuming Jack was one person and was responsible for the Whitechapel Murders). This is rather a poor epitaph for a man, described as looking and sounding more like a bank manager than a policeman, who had a glittering career in the Metropolitan Police, was promoted early and went on to work as a detective and private investigator long after the last recorded Ripper murder. Largely influenced by the portrayals in films, which often have him as a loner and a drunk or addict - none of which has any historically recorded accuracy - Abberline has been served poorly by history. He certainly had a favourite suspect in the Ripper case (George Chapman), but was never able to prove any involvement. In many ways Abberline\u2019s poor and unfair reputation was the final victim of the Ripper. ",

            "answer_text": "Best is a subjective term when talking about detectives. It might mean the one with the most cases solved or it might mean that the detective solves the case the fastest just to name a couple of criteria that could be used to determine this. My opinion of the best detective is one that works to solve a case for as long as it takes to do so. Certainly there are cases that eventually go cold and remain unsolved but a dedicated investigator wouldn\u2019t stop finding or developing new leads and evidence. The new cases are always the most pressing because they are the ones with the freshest clues, witnesses and other aspects that can lead to them being solved when acted on while they are fresh. Unfortunately there seems to always be a new case to work on and manpower is allocated to them leaving the older ones to be worked on as time permits. While the man in the field is the person that gets the credit for the case being solved there are many other people involved that help make that possible. Forensic scientists, experts on certain subjects contained in the case and even the people that write the reports and things like that all play a part. It\u2019s a team effort that allows the case to be solved in today\u2019s world rather than the lone detective of yesteryear. One individual that would certainly qualify for the naming as the best detective would be John \u201cJigsaw\u201d St. John, who was a Los Angeles police officer and detective for 51 years and was reportedly to have closed more than two thirds of the over 1000 cases he worked on. What really made him stand out was his ability to remember minute details from previous interviews or crime scenes that helped him to become an expert on serial killers as well as his determination to solve his cases.
