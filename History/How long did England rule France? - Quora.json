            "answer_text": "There are a few ways of answering this question. The simplest is to say that at no point did the English crown/government physically control the whole territorial extent of modern France. A more complicated answer: William the Conqueror invaded England in 1066 and became King of England. He was already Duke of Normandy, and so the significant territories he had in northern France technically became part of the English crown. In 1153, these territories expanded massively. Henry II (of England) married the Duchess of Aquitaine (who had previously been married to the heir to the King of France) in 1152, and in 1153 he won a civil war to take the English crown. Most of western France (the Duchy of Aquitaine) thus came under the control of the English throne. It\u2019s probably important to note at this point that the rulers of England spoke French and probably spent as much time in their French territories as they did in England, so it\u2019s kind of difficult to consider them \u2018English\u2019 in a modern sense. For a couple of centuries England thus technically ruled more of France than the King of France did. Territory gradually slipped away from the Angevin empire (what this amalgamation is now called) until the end of the Hundred Years\u2019 War in 1453, by which point all that was left of the English possessions on the continent was the town of Calais and its immediate surroundings (which Mary I lost in 1558). Throughout this period there was a King of France, whose kingdom centred on Paris. It\u2019s interesting to note, though, that in 1420 Henry V (of England) signed the Treaty of Troyes with Charles VI (of France), which made him heir to the French throne. He married Charles\u2019 daughter, but died a couple of years later. Henry VI wasn\u2019t a great warrior king and the geopolitics had changed a lot so it proved impossible to collect on that agreement. From the death of Charles VI until 1802, however, the English monarch always listed King/Queen of France amongst their titles because of this agreement, even if it was just a few words on some paper and a few lilies on their crest.
