            "answer_text": "It depends on how you define ceasefire. A popular definition amongst english speaking jews is: ceasefire- we cease, they fire. For the past year or 2, israel faced near daily firebombs from gaza floated in via helium balloons. \u2018Peaceful protesters\u2019 at the fence have been either themselves, or directly covering members of hamas. Statistics on fatalities are also a farce. Israel has invested billions of dollars in missile defense systems, so unless organizations in gaza overload the iron dome\u2019s capabilities to stop the rockets from falling, israeli civilian centers are protected (and even then, there is an extensive system of air raid sirens to provide at least limited warning). Hamas and the other terrorist groups hace invested their time, money and resources into trying to kill israelis, and they use their own people as human shields. Hamas launches rockets from near schools, mosques and hospitals. Their main command center is in a hospital. They store their weaponry in UN schools. The recent border protests are organized by hamas so that when israeli soldiers are forced to confront a mass of gazan civilians threatening to break through the border, hamas snipers are there to shoot at the soldiers. Hamas has launched anti-tank missiles at school buses. All this is fairly well documented. I am on my phone, so finding and linking sources is difficult, bur if you are sincere in your question, you will do some genuine fact finding yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not every ceasefire. But it is true that in the majority of cases it is Israel that initiated the attacks. This is attested by strong evidence: 1) Israeli breaks cease fires: : Reigniting Violence: How Do Ceasefires End? 2) the IDF is, almost always, the one that starts firing first. Israel/Gaza Cease-Fire Dynamics Breakdown - The Jerusalem Fund 3) More evidence the IDF is the aggressor: Infographic: Who violates ceasefires more, Israelis or Palestinians? 4) A UK study finds that the IDF shells or attacks about twice a day (UK government: 700 Israeli attacks on Gaza since 2014 ceasefire). 5) Though both sides retaliate: Both sides retaliate in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict 6) Hamas responds to IDF bombings in 2014; Hamas fires rockets for first time since 2012, Israeli officials say 7) Just as in 2006, when Hamas only struck after IDF shelling: Indiscriminate Fire | Palestinian Rocket Attacks on Israel and Israeli Artillery Shelling in the Gaza Strip 8) Or August 2018, when Hamas responded to IDF tank fire. Israeli army lifts restrictions on Gaza border communities after quiet night 9) Or November 2018, when an armed incursion by the IDF left 7 dead and Hamas responded: Israeli targeted killings in Gaza and beyond: A timeline 10) Or May 2019, when Gaza responded to the IDF killing 4 and wounding 82: Wounded one Friday and killed the next \u2014 Palestinian youth is shot far from Gaza fence 11) In 2008, again, Israel broke the cease-fire by killing 6: https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/48000/pol100012009en.pdf(page 182-183 12: List of Israeli attacks, day by day, in 2014 Gaza conflict: List of Israeli strikes and Palestinian casualties in the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict - Wikipedia 13: More reports of Israeli attacks: Updates - - None of the pro-Israel side here posts any information on any attack by Israel. They list attacks by Palestinians without any context, such as when Israel attacks first. ",
