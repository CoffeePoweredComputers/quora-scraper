            "answer_text": "King Xerxes was \u201cin high spirits from wine\u201d literally \u201cthe heart was good\u201d or even, \u201cwhen the wine had gone to the king\u2019s head\u201d is a good translation (1:10). The implication is that he was to some degree intoxicated. So it was on impulse, that he gave the order for Queen Vashti to be brought before his assembled guests, wearing her golden crown (1:10\u201311). The king wanted to display before the ordinary people and his princes her extraordinary beauty (1:11). A repeated emphasis upon her beauty occurs in the book, however, he would not have wanted to put her beauty on show in such a public manner, had his judgement not been influenced by the wine he had drunk. I believe it was in this context that Vashti declined. She probably did so because the lewdness that her unexpected appearance at such a gathering would have occasioned. Strangers were not allowed to look at the beauty of Persian wives (Josephus Antiquities X1. 191) and queen Vashti\u2019s defiance therefore, was a modest and totally justifiable refusal to appear before a group of men who, if not drunk, were probably on the verge of intoxication. Her refusal however, enraged the king and his anger burned within him (1:12). His anger needs to be seen in the light of the honor-based society of which the king was head. To shame the king by disobedience was bound to produce the most extreme response. The greater emphasis we place upon human status, the angrier we become when it is placed in jeopardy. Xerxes\u2019 anger clearly had a habit of arising and then subsiding ( cf 2:1 ; 7:7,10). When kings were all powerful, all feared their anger (Proverbs 16:14 ; 20:2). Furious Xerxes set in motion irrevocable disciplinary action against her. The counsel of the book of Proverbs is relevant \u201cA fool shows his annoyance at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult\u201d (Proverbs 12:16 ; cf 14:29 ; 16:32). Two key questions need to be asked: Would Xerxes have commanded Vashti to be brought before his guests \u2014 rather like a piece of furniture \u2014 if he had been completely sober?If he had been sober, would he have become so angry?",

            "answer_text": "This excerpt from the bible encyclopedia INSIGHT ON THE SCRIPTURES should answer your question: - [*** it-2 p. 1148 Vashti *** VASHTI (Vash\u02b9ti). The queen of Ahasuerus (Xerxes I) the king of Persia. In the third year of his reign, Ahasuerus called in all the nobles, princes, and servants from the jurisdictional districts. At the end of the conference, he held a seven-day banquet. Similarly, Vashti held a banquet for the women at the royal house. On the seventh day, Ahasuerus ordered his court officials to bring in Vashti in royal headdress, that all might see her loveliness. (It seems that the queen would ordinarily eat meals at the king\u2019s table, but history does not give proof of this as being the case at great banquets. Besides, at the time, Vashti was holding a banquet with the women.) For some unstated reason, Vashti persistently refused. Ahasuerus turned to his wise men who knew the law, and he was advised by Memucan, a prince, that it was not the king alone that Vashti had wronged but also all the princes and people in the jurisdictional districts. He said that when the princesses should hear what the queen had done (which news would quickly be spread in the castle), they would follow Vashti\u2019s action as a precedent for contemptuous action on their own part. (Es 1:1-22) Vashti was deposed, and about four years later, Esther the Jewess was selected to become the wife of Ahasuerus and to take the royal office of Vashti.\u2014Es 2:1-17.] ",
