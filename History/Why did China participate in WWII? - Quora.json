            "answer_text": "China did not participate voluntarily in WW2 \u2026. because Japan had been the Bad Neighbor for a very long time. One of the first things Japan did was attack China once Japan had rejoined the modern world (1894). In WW1, I think Japan hoped to take over the German sphere of influence (Shantung province) when they defeated the Germans there but was defeated when China cleverly joined the Entente as well. With the change in the nature of the Japanese government and its increasing domination by the will of the military after the disappointment of the post Great War peace, the situation became worse with the takeover of Manchuria, the Shanghai incident (around 1932, IIRC, as a result of protests over Manchuria), and then a steady chipping away at Chinese Sovereignty that ran from that time to the incident in 1937 that ignited full-fledged warfare with the Japanese as the Chinese people had had just about enough and really forced the National Leadership into a \u201cWar of Resistance\u201d. Although Chiang Kai Shek (Jiang Jiensi IIRC) expected other powers, especially the Western Powers to intervene after the expansion into the area of Shanghai, no overt help was received. The Chinese DID get foreign aid from various powers, including the pragmatic Stalin of the USSR (who wanted the Japanese to be \u2018busy\u2019 in China and not messing with Russian territory in the Far East), it wasn\u2019t enough to be hugely successful. It was, though, sufficient to prolong resistance and to allow the Chinese to administer defeats to overconfident Japanese forces (Taierzhuang) and overextended Japanese forces (as at Changsha). Whenever the Japanese came to a point where it was \u2018back down\u2019 or find a political solution, the leadership usually upped the ante. It came to pass, then, that the desire to cut off imports to China led to the occupation of Chinese ports, only to find imports coming from elsewhere. That led to the occupation of French Indochina. Imports were still coming from Burma so that would lead to war with Britain AND the USA, probably, so that choice led to Pearl Harbor. In the end, the Nationalist government was correct. Japan would eventually draw the ire and military forces of Great Powers down on themselves. As of December 7, 1941, China was no longer alone in the struggle against Japan. It wasn\u2019t China joining WW2 but rather WW2 joined the Chinese struggle. ",

            "answer_text": "They didn\u2019t exactly choose to participate. One morning Chinese civilians in Manchuria woke up to this:  Japanese troops marching through their town. Of course I use \u201cwoke up\u201d in a metaphorical sense. They probably heard the Japanese army coming, and many of them were killed by bombs and artillery before the troops actually marched into town, but the invasion itself caught a lot of people(including some members of the Japanese government) by surprise. The Japanese military(acting somewhat insubordinately from the government in Tokyo) launched an invasion of Manchuria(in northern China), and the Chinese had to respond with war.  It isn\u2019t like the Japanese called up the Chinese and said \u201cHey we want to go to war, if you are interested call us back\u201d\u2026.the Chinese weren\u2019t given the option. China got invaded and the Chinese had to respond. Since China was struggling with internal political problems this wasn\u2019t exactly the best timing for an invasion, but as a country they had to rally together to defend themselves against the invasion.  As you can see the Japanese made it pretty deep into China. The traditional heart of Chinese civilization is the Hebei, Henan, Shanxi region which was almost completely conquered by the Japanese at one point. With such a fast acting, dangerous enemy China had to fight back, otherwise they could risk being completely subjugated by the Japanese. Life under the Japanese occupation forces was brutal. Normal civilian women were raped almost daily, people were shot for no reason, living conditions were rough, and the Japanese would conduct horrific experiments on the people of China. It was in every Chinese citizen\u2019s best interest to resist this occupation, lest they live a life under such an oppressive regime. ",
