            "answer_text": "There are the Canary islands, just a bit more than 100 kms from the nearest to the African coast. They belong to Spain. Also there are two cities and some smaller places on the Maroccon coast, inhabited by Spain since around 1500 and still remaining part of Spain. One - Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez - used to be an Island, but was conected ot the Maroccon mainland by a storm in 1934, who build a landstrip between island and coast. Other Spanish cities, like Tetuan, were handed over to Marocco, by Franco, and the entire population transfered to the Spanish mainland. And there are also Portuguese islands in the Atlantic, west of Africa, one could also consider to belong to Africa geographicly. ",
