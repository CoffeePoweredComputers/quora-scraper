This line comes from \"The Hounds of Baskervilles\" featuring Sherlock Holmes (I have new info that this was apparently NOT in the original book, but only in the TV series). Here is the exchange: Sherlock: I never did ask, Dr. Franklyn. What is it exactly that you do here? Doctor: Oh, Mr. Holmes, I would love to tell you, but then, of course, I'd have to kill you. Sherlock: That would be tremendously ambitious of you. The story first appeared in 1901 serialized in the Strand Magazine before coming out in a book. The book has been a popular one ever since, a beloved crime novel and a staple of high school English literature classes (at least in the United States). The line has since appeared in many movies, including Top Gun with Tom Cruise. Here\u2019s a handy YouTube video compiling many snippets with this line and variations on it:  ",

            "answer_text": "Like the other Quora poster here, I also found a Hound of the Baskervilles reference but not in the novel. Another source claims that it is originally from Oscar Wilde\u2019s The Picture of Dorian Grey, But I taught that story for years and do not recall that statement. A third source credits it to the James Bond film Dr. No, I can find no proof nor do I remember ever hearing that line. Although, it does sound very 007-ish. Perhaps the best answer I can find is the most plausible. It has its origins in the wit of regular, grassroots hoi polloi. Someone said it among his friends who thought it was clever, they told it to others, who told it to others, and so on. In fact, this is how many sayings originate. They are often credited to the first person to write them down and have them published. ",
