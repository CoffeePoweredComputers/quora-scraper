            "answer_text": "At full employment, it doesn\u2019t. I was in Florida in 2005, during its worst hurricane season, and overheard some people saying \u201cwell this will be good for the economy.\u201d In 2005, Florida had full employment. All of the extra employment for roofers displaced employment for other professions. This is known as the \u201cBroken Window Fallacy.\u201d A thief breaking a window does not create jobs for the glaziers. The shop-owner would have spent the money on something else, which in turn was hurt in equal measure to the glazier\u2019s benefit. Similarly, the extra spending for war mobilization is not a free lunch at full employment. In reality, spending on war mobilization is money not spent on other goods with more hedonic value. Parable of the broken window - Wikipedia A big caveat though is at full employment. World War II \u201cended\u201d the Great Depression through massive government spending, far bigger than the previous New Deal programs. Less than full employment should technically never happen if prices and wages are set immediately to market levels. In practice, wage levels are very tough to move downward. So if the dollar becomes more valuable, wages are above market-clearing level and unemployment results. If and only if a large amount of cyclical unemployment exists does a war \u201chelp\u201d an economy in any way. The second Iraq war or the Vietnam war didn\u2019t have big benefits for employment compared to pre-war levels. And when the economy is not at full employment, the war is a second-best solution to either a monetary solution or a fiscal solution on something more worthwhile than war materiel. ",

            "answer_text": "This question suggest that you aren\u2019t old enough to remember how our economy seemed to keep growing during the Vietnam era, and throughout the entire Cold War. Every major manufacturer wanted a piece of that pie, referring to the billions of dollars being spent by the government on defense, as well as billions being spent on offensive weapons as well. They weren\u2019t call that then, but were \u201cdeodorants\u201d which kept our enemies on their toes. When a major contractor with the government bids on a project, that company will have sat down, looked at what the cost is to build what our government needs along with improving the item with updates required to make it as good as it can be. Let\u2019s do a bit of examining, and there truly isn\u2019t any way I can list all of what these people put in their proposal, but we\u2019ll cover a number of items which should offer you a better understanding. First they will evaluate whether they can build an air plane which the Pentagon, this is where our military brass work, has discussed with their leading pilots, and commanders what they need to stay ahead of other countries. When they have a picture of what they need then they will use engineers in whichever branch to work on the details. It\u2019s not like you go to a manufacturer of planes and order them like we order food at fast food places, or even restaurants for that matter. Once finished, those companies who in the past have filled orders for our government will be contacted, and a detailed description given to each one who wishes to supply a bid to build this plane. When this happens, each bidding company usually must pay our government for the right to bid, this is to keep the companies honest, and to give everyone a fair chance in the process. So using $10,000,000.00 (ten-million dollars) for example, this means these companies are putting their own money for the potential right to build the aircraft. So you better be sure you are able to do this prior to putting up a large sum of money. Upon finding out your company has won the bid, you and your logistic people, who have most of this done, or should have, and I refer to contacting what we call Vinder\u2019s, these are smaller companies who build items which will be needed in the air plane in question. These could be wiring harnesses, connectors, warning devices and the list will boggle the mind, I\u2019m sure, if you were to see it all. Having built other air craft they will need to have someone with whom they purchase their metals from for use in the Air Frame of the plane, and then quiet possibly the skin of the air craft as well. Immediately upon learning that you\u2019ve won the bid you will also use a number of different ways to bring in new engineer\u2019s to your company to work with the design engineers to come up with a number of mock up planes, these are designs which can be presented to the government and while this is going on, usually there are one or two of these air craft built so they can be tested. So you go from a concept given you, to a drawing, and mock up of this plane, and then you take it slowly to where you have built the planes, and then they begin testing these. This happens if the people who ordered the plane like what they hear, and what they see. During the building of the mock up/test planes, they are doing extensive testing on these to avoid any or as many as possible problems which occur when building a new plane from scratch. Using the 80\u2019s for example, lets say the plane we are discussing is what will be known as the F-14 Tomcat. This means that not only does this plane need to perform, it will be required each time if leaves the deck of an aircraft carrier to accept the punishment of being launched from that ship like being shot out of a cannon, then fly it\u2019s mission, and return to the carrier. This where things get very interesting for now you are asking this plane to accept the punishment of what Navy Pilots refer to as a Controlled Crash when landing. Each portion of this air plane needs to be manufactured, and then those company who manufactures them also needs to build replacements for like it or not items in the plane do wear out. So you might have a small company in one part of the country who builds items and this opens the doors for more workers who have the skills and training to help them produce them, and this repeats through the country so the potential for quite of few areas where manufacturers will need help throughout the life of this aircraft. For you don\u2019t want to be, referring to the planes on the carriers, at sea and find out that you don\u2019t have replacement parts for this can render this tool of government useless. With many different needs during a war, for when this occurs you plan for these aircraft in some cases to be destroyed, it is the nature of war. When the entire nation is on a war time footing, it means that every item for luxury, or convenience are put on hold and the companies are working with one goal in mind, to make their parts, which make up not only planes, but tanks, weapons, ammunition, bombs, etc., etc., and the people working in these plants are usually older, women, until recently, and youth who are too young to go to war, but can help in these areas as well. The goal is to become a well oiled machine producing what is needed and required to defeat your enemy or enemies. With the government footing the bill, money is spent and the economy grows. At the end of hostilities in World War 2 there were some people who had gotten so used to the long hours and the good pay they weren\u2019t happy the war was over. This might be called PTSD today for those workers for they had worked for quite a long time with no end in sight in the beginning. Now you enter a different time, and this is the down sizing of your military, and the need for these war items are no longer required as they were previously. That is in itself a completely different story. Hopefully this answered your question. ",
