            "answer_text": "It's important to differentiate between the movement and the actual group BLM to answer this question. I was a long time supporter of the group BLM until July of 2016 when the leadership of that group began calling for violence against the police. I personally received that email. I do not support or condone any violence against anyone at anytime and as such do not support the GROUP BLM. Now the black lives matter movement is a whole other matter. The majority of people want race relations improved, want accountability from the police and want profiling to stop. They protest peacefully and without violence. Those every day activists trying to change the world do make me proud to be an American and I support them 100%. The issue becomes one of separating group from movement which is not always easy to do. ",

            "answer_text": "Sadly, honestly no. They don't. I have worked with and still work with Black Americans. Hard working people. BLM movement isn't Dr. King's Dream, isn't Malcolm X's there is no white or black Americans just green. They are thugs who destroy everything down they see. Sadly our enemies also see this and are watching for Uncle Charlie Manson Helter Skelter race war. They'll be no borrowing money from the Chinese government, they'll be no borrowing from anyone. And with that said. We'll have to pay off our debt. And the taxes will be unreasonable high, and any entitlements such as Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and Welfare benefits will all go away. And oh yeah I'm a registered Democrat. ",
