            "answer_text": "The UK Government put England (England doesn't have its own Government unlike Scotland, Wales and NI) under extreme restrictions (a lockdown would cease all movement and you would be banned from leaving home) to halt the spread of the virus in the hope of buying more time for a vaccine to be found. It also didn't want to overburden the NHS with severely ill patients, the aim is to make things more manageable particularly for the NHS. The current flaws in this are; No point surviving coronavirus only to suffer a major economic meltdown, a large number of companies going bust, record unemployment and homelessness etcInfluenza circulates all year and there is a flu season, the common cold circulates all year infecting especially in winter, and measles, mumps & rubella continue to circulate - how is it that they think 6 months of extreme restrictions will get rid of this virus completely especially when we recommence worldwide travel?",

They had other considerations, like Brexit and the general economy, and we're loathe to shut the country down. Circumstances have forced their hand as the virus is taking over. ",
