            "answer_text": "Because nobody has come up with a really good way to do it yet.[1] Broadly speaking, there are five ways to reform the Security Council, and all of them come with noticeable issues: Abolishing the Security Council: The ultimate reform would be to just scrap the entire thing and let the General Assembly do all of the work. This is, in truth, an utterly impractical idea as it would likely be impossible to wrangle the entire GA to deal with emergency situations and would add a whole new level of complexities to the internal political dynamics of dealing with large-scale problems.[2]Keeping the Security Council, but abolishing permanent membership: This, in some ways, defeats the point of having a Security Council. One of it's core benefits is its ability to maintain a relatively stable set of outcomes; uncertainty is one of the biggest problems in the somewhat anarchic sphere of international politics and, by keeping a core group of members constant, the Security Council has been able to walk a somewhat predictable line.Keeping the permanent members, but removing the \"veto\" power (or diluting the \"veto\" power in some way): This would probably be a death knell for the United Nations. The only way to bring the powerful countries to the table is to afford them some ability to shape the directions that the United nations goes. Without that, they'd be as well off without dealing with the United Nations as they would be if they had dealt with it.Expanding the number of permanent members: It's hard enough to deal with the complex political and geostrategic relationships that exist between the current permanent members. Now imagine adding more countries to the mix. The League of Nations failed, in part, because everyone had a veto, and that makes it hard to build any effectual consensus because there's too much balancing taking place.  Adding more permanent members to the Security Council will hamstring the council  more than it already is as new diplomatic-relationship dynamics are added to the mix. Plus, you have to deal with how you balance the number of permanent members with the number of non-permanent members; does expanding the permanent membership necessitate expanding the size of the council and, if so, when does the council become so big that it becomes too unwieldy?Replacing permanent members: Who gets replaced? Who gets new seats? The United States and China, undoubtedly, are head-and-shoulders above the other three permanent members in terms of raw power, but it gets pretty murky quite quickly after that. Is India more deserving than the United Kingdom? Germany than Russia? Japan than France? Sure, virtually everyone agrees in principle that the world isn't the same as it was 5-6 decades ago, but nobody has a really clear picture of what that means in actual concrete terms. All the countries that are mentioned as possible permanent members all have good and bad qualities.[3] But all of the countries that have seats also have compelling cases to be made in their favor.For more on some of the things mentioned here, see: Should the UN Security Council be disbanded?Should all countries have equal say in the UN? Should voting power be proportional to population? Why should elitist circles of powerful countries (Security Council) call the shots? Does this not result in the suppression and possible exploitation?United Nations Security Council: On what grounds is the veto power given to only a few countries?What are the pros and cons of the veto power wielded by the Security Council's permanent members?What would be the consequences of removing the veto power of the \"permanent five\" (US, UK, France, Russia, China) in the UN Security Council?[1] In truth, nobody has come with even a acceptably OK way of doing it yet. [2] Doing this also has the effect of putting a country like Togo on the same footing as China. One of the beauties of the United Nations is that it has--more effectively than many other international institutions-- been able to manage both idealistic principles while still providing for a realist-centric world-view.  [3] See William Petroff's answer to Why shouldn't India get a permanent seat in the UN Security Council? for more on that. ",

            "answer_text": "Reformed how?  As soon as anyone makes a specific proposal, this attracts opposition.   Britain and France got their seats when they were the cores of global empires.  This is no longer merited in terms of power. A rational reform would be: Remove the Veto.France and Britain to lose their Permanent Seats on the Security Council.Japan and India to get Permanent Seats.The chances of anything like this happening are essentially zero.  The USA is out of tune with the rest of the world on many issues, and prefers being able to ignore the UN on many issues, notably Israel, but they also protected Apartheid South Africa for many years, as did Britain. Rising powers like China and India are not interventionist and have no wish to see the UN becoming a genuinely powerful global authority. ",
