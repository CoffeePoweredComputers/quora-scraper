            "answer_text": "How did Romans build their homes? This differs depending upon wealth and social class. Poorer people did not build homes. They rented. They might live above or behind streetfront shops, or in apartment buildings or tenements, sometimes several stories high. Construction for these could be flimsy and because of the amount of wood they often burned or just fell down. This reconstruction of the Insula of Diana (apartment building) at Ostia Antica was probably much nicer than most apartments:  Probably the worst build tenements didn\u2019t leave much behind for archaeologists to find. Most families would have had one room without toilet or cooking facilities. They would have used public latrines:  and they would have dined at the Roman equivalent of \u201cfast food\u201d restaurants, such as this thermopolium:  They also had access to public baths and other public spaces. Wealthy Romans probably inherited family homes and refurbished them occasionally. (New building did happen, but most homes were used generation after generation). A basic floor plan contained these elements.  The main entrance is on the left. It opens into an atrium; the rectangle in the middle of the atrium is a shallow pool, usually open to the sky above. Across from the front entrance the alcove might have had lares, a shrine to the household gods.  Beyond and behind the atrium (the larger square on the right) is a columned peristyle (garden) open to the sky. Cubicles surrounding these could have various purposes (office, dining, bedrooms, storage). According to Andrew Wallace- Hadril, there was often a distinction between public space (atrium) and private space. Wealthy people had sumptuous decorations: marble or mosaic floors, marble columns, frescoes. Some houses had running water; some gardens had fountains.   I particularly like this playful and realistic mosaic of food scraps:  Slaves might have slept on pallets in a kitchen or family member\u2019s room; a separate slave quarter might not exist except in larger houses and estates. Furniture tended to be a bit sparse. This floorplan for the Villa of the Labyrinth shows more space probably with more specialized uses.  A large house would have a triclinium (dining room)  The most luxurious houses had private baths. Except in the largest establishments, jobs such as laundry or baking were outsourced to shops. (In my historical fantasy set in Pompeii, I used the Villa of the Labyrinth as the model for the home of Marcus Tullius; see Historical Fantasy) ",
