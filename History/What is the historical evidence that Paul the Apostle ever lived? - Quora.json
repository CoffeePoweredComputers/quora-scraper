            "answer_text": "Someone wrote several of the earliest epistles in the New testament and wrote on each that his name was Paul. That this author existed has to be a truism, even if we can not be sure of his name. However, there is no known reason for someone to have used that name pseudonymously, so we can assume that his name really was Paul. The fact that these epistles were preserved and became widely circulated before the end of the first century means that those to whom the epistles were addressed valued his memory. Even the fact that additional epistles were written in Paul\u2019s name after his death, is further evidence that Paul was known to have existed. There may be no independent, non-biblical evidence that the apostle Paul ever lived, but I think the above analysis proves he did. ",

Perhaps you could try to prove that the epistles of Paul were written by another Christian called Paul. ",
