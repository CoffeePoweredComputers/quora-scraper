            "answer_text": "If you are talking about quality and the ability to last a long time. I\u2019ve driven these cars quite a lot. I\u2019ve either owned them, or drove them at work multiple times, when I worked for a rental car company. Under the compact category- Toyota Corolla - Consumer Report\u2019s number one pick. - The Toyota CEO told them to stop making boring cars, so they went hog wild crazy in the body design in the other direction. Smooth, quiet, ride, makes you think you are in a mini-luxury car. Honda Civic - Nice looks on the outside and much better handling and tracking than the Corolla. You will be noticed, plus if you can drive a manual, it is really a lot of fun, more so than the automatic version. 3rd place Hyundai Elantra- They get a much better basic warranty than the cars above. Under the midsize category- Honda Accord- I like the body style of it better than that of the Camry. But I\u2019m no fan of turbo-charged engines (longevity concerns). Reliability has been good, but it is down a little bit from previous Accord\u2019s. My last Accord achieved 307,194 over a period of more than 10 years, with NO major issues. Toyota Camry- It has some wild disjointed styling, but it is the car that I\u2019d pick. The mileage is fantastic on the highway (I got 40 mpg on a 1,000 mile trip). My last Camry achieved 292,504 miles over 17 years with NO major issues. I guarantee, had another driver not t-boned it, I\u2019d still be driving it today. Kia Optima- I now own have a Sonata, which is just as good. BUT, after experiencing the Optima, I would have chosen it had I tested it out, when I was looking. They are same underneath, but the Optima has better, more responsive handling. Also like the Hyundai, it comes with a long 5 year, 60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty. The other brands only give you 3 year, 30,000 miles. Cars I would not recommend.- I love the Impala, but would not recommend any other GM car. They are going to stop making them, which means support will be a hassle in the future. Also, they have start/stop technology, which you cannot disengage. Infuriating! Love the Ford Fusion, when it comes to Ford. But they too are going to stop making them, so I think they have hurt themselves. Sure gas is cheap because of the Saudi-Opec gas war, but it will not stay that way. Lastly SUV\u2019s- I am NOT a fan of SUV\u2019s, definitely not the big one, or only a slight fan of the small ones. But based on exposure, if you absolutely have to follow the crowd. I\u2019d say Hyundai Tucson and Sante Fe(small 4 or 5 passengers suv), excellent warranty, easy controls, smooth ride. Kia Sportage and Sorento, for the same reasons, as I would consider the Hyundai\u2019s, just mentioned. I like the rugged looks of the new RAV 4, better. But I absolutely hate the \u2018loud\u2019 noisy interior, rattling engine, and rough ride. Honda CRV\u2019s is a good car, but it has that little turbo charged engine and I\u2019m not a fan of any car with those types of engine. Because any high pressure vehicle, is going to have a powertrain that is not going to last a longer as cars I\u2019ve previously owned. Ford\u2019s new Escape- Looks good, but I\u2019d not buy it with a 3-cylinder engine (come on, give me a break). Large SUV\u2019s- would never buy one (gas mileage is pitiful), but I did sample the new Hyundai Palisade. Not bad. Whew! Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "They are all very similar. I've owned almost every Japanese brand over recent years.  It depends on what you consider better, and what subjective styling cues you find  compelling.  I'm not sure anyone would ever accuse Toyota of beautiful design, nor Subaru.  Nissan and Mazda try hard with design, to my eye, Nissan has some nicer cars visually.  Honda has faded to bland in the past few years, but they have loyal customers who buy their products anyway.  They ALL have had recalls and safety and reliability problems.  No car is perfect. Mechanically, they are all incredibly similar.  Many of them source parts from exactly the same suppliers, so even at the component level, they are somewhat the same.  They try to differentiate on engines and transmissions, but with the exception of Nissan, who is a major proponent of CVTs (continuously variable transmissions), they are all pretty much the same.  Engines are all pretty solid these days, and usually outlast the rest of the car.  Subaru has had some problems with engines (still have oil consumption problems) in recent years.  Mazda had some oil leak problems.  But in general, they are all pretty solid, if moderately boring. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, my favorite Japanese car would have to be the Nissan GT-R also called the R35. While Nissan isn\u2019t the first name that comes to you when it comes to a sports car, they have produced something that has rivaled the indomitable Porsche 911, one of the biggest names in high-end sports cars. This is the product of some truly remarkable Japanese engineering and a lot of technical marvels. That and a 3.8 Litre twin turbocharged V6 engine ,which is handmade, and produces somewhere around 500 BHP. The Nissan GT-R has a reputation for its brutal acceleration which propels this car from 0\u201362 mph ( 0\u2013100 kmph) in under 3 seconds. It\u2019s also known for its insane cornering abilities thanks to a very aerodynamic body and a slick four wheel drive system. In fact a modified version of the R35 set a record for fastest powerslide ever at some 350 kmph. I will admit it is not a pretty car and it is almost a decade old now and it may be cheap in other countries but in India it costs more than 10 Million Rupees which is more compared to how much you get it for abroad. But it still never fails to excite me or any car enthusiast for that matter. I have actually only seen the car once on the streets and it was certainly loud as hell. It is truly the zenith of what the Japanese can truly deliver. P.S I sincerely apologize for sounding like a Nissan salesman but this car is the only thing that occurred to me as the best Japanese car, as in what is quintessentially Japanese. I was first enticed by it when I saw reaction videos to it\u2019s savage launch control. BTW my second favorite Japanese car would have to be the Lexus LFA which is a great car but just not as drastic, if you feel me. Let me remind you however that Jeremy Clarkson, a truly unforgiving person, said it was the best car he has ever driven and that deserves a \u2018nuff said. ",

            "answer_text": "Based on my experience, in Belgium. In my opinion, Nissan, because they have the Nissan Navara (Frontier), Nissan Titan, Nissan Patrol and Nissan GTR. They build cars that people have dignity driving. It\u2019s true lately they\u2019ve been using Renault engines and parts (and vice versa), but that\u2019s what makes them look cooler. I prefer Nissan, but here\u2019s my thought of other brands. Toyota\u2026 credits to their 4x4s, I\u2019m in love with the Hilux and Land Cruiser. They also deserve credit for their hybrid models. Points lost to rest of their cars, very boring, weird design sometimes, and lack of character. Honda, I LOVE the new Civic, it looks cool! Honda cars are slightly more attractive than Toyota. Many people have told me that their reliability is superior, they just keep going, never stop. Mitsubishi, hard to find their dealers, and not many choices of models. Although, it kicked a lotta asses in rally and motorsports. Subaru, public presence is almost non-existent. If you do spot a Subaru or its dealer, you deserve to be in the world record stating how observant you are. However, like Mitsubishi, they also kicked a lot in motorsports. I was told that Subarus have this unique ability to start instantly, no matter how bad the conditions are\u2026 I don\u2019t know how far it\u2019s true. ",

That said, a high end Nissan or Honda is going to be a better vehicle than a lesser priced Toyota, but if we are just talking about cars of the same class, then Toyota is the clear leader. Over my years in Japan, I have owned Japanese made by all the car makers. I have found Toyota to be the best to own and operate. On the other hand, my favorite car was a Mitsubishi Pajero. I loved that little jeep.  Toyota has 30% of the market, so I am not alone in my sentiments. ",

It depends on what you consider better, and what subjective styling cues you find compelling. I'm not sure anyone would ever accuse Toyota of beautiful design, nor Subaru. Nissan and Mazda try hard with design, to my eye, Nissan has some nicer cars visually. Honda has faded to bland in the past few years, but they have loyal customers who buy their products anyway. They ALL have had recalls and safety and reliability problems. No car is perfect. ",

My personal pick would be the R34 Skyline Z Tune. This came with a much more spruced up engine from the factory line , the RB26DETT Z1. This was taken straight off the GT500 car and it made a whopping 500 HP. Just imagine. That kind of power is something, the most expensive cars of today make. And look at the R34. It's stunning. It's a work of art. It's just so simple. No fancy curvy lines , no fancy cuts , no big gaping intake holes , looks like your regular Skyline , but boy is that going to kick some serious bottom, even in today's standards. PS : Only 20 of them were ever made. Doesn't that add to the uniqueness factor entirely ? Shrvs ",

            "answer_text": "All cars today are far more reliable than cars in the past. This may seem counterintuitive in that cars today are so filled with computers, sensors, passive restraint systems and active safety systems as compared to cars in the past but it is really more of a testament to the better engineering and quality control that these systems have brought to the car making business. Specific to the question, all Japanese brands are more reliable on average than their competitors but the gap has narrowed so much that is is almost insignificant. Well, except for Jeep and Fiats I guess. If you look at JD Power rankings you will see one particular brand that is always at or near the top: Lexus. Sure, they are boring - even more boring that their Toyota brethren - but when it comes to pure reliability, boring is good. ",
