            "answer_text": "Firstly, Japan was till then an independent entity throughout the history ruled by a single strain of royalty. After industrialization, there was massive need of raw materials, mainly iron ore and fuel. As the companies of far located European countries had already monopolized the sources, Japanese embarked in their own way, on a conquest of China and Manchuria to have firm sources of supply. However, in the process they used terror to achieve these ends. This was decried by US. And since by that time Europe was engulfed by war and Japan was siding with Germany, the US was suspicious at Japan. As the relations soured, USA gave an ultimatum to Japan that she should desist war with China, otherwise face embargo. As US was supplying iron scrap and fuel which were very vital to Japanese, they felt US was poking it's nose in their affairs and to end it strike a big blow to it's assets (particularly air craft carriers) from which it would take time to recuperate, in the mean while because of Germany was winning France (and also England) the political equations would change. With this view Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. However, three years of war gave different and quite opposite results. Germany, which went up to Moscow, was due to weather and logistical difficulties, pushed back and back up to Berlin. With the defeat of other Axis partners, Japan now faced a combined force of enemies alone. However, even then the situation was not hopeless, their armies are on foreign soil, not foreign army on Japanese soil. Actually this was the right time to go in for peace. The Allies served an ultimatum to surrender. But the problem was this. They simply did not know how to end a war. From the day one \u2014 Japanese started hostilities without declaration of war. During war, they did not heed to Geneva Convention and committed atrocities on civilian population as well as prisoners of war. An unconditional surrender may bring same fate on their Emperor, on their government, and their population. With these in mind, they hovered but not came to a conclusion. They also felt that the enemy could not conquer their country physically, as they do not know about atom bomb. The battle of Okinawa saw mixed results. Allies losses we're enormous, but it was the first time that a foreign soldier set foot upon it's soil. American thought that conquering Japan would be a costly affair in terms of soldiers. In order to rein in an insolent enemy, they had a newly developed arsenal, atom bomb. Truman ordered it's using, and the bombs we're dropped, and a fiery air raid destroyed Nippon Fuel storage facility. This changed the situation and the prevarication ended. The cabinet recommended surrender since further execution of war was not possible. Hower, some hardliners did not budge. But Hiro Hito, saw the futility of prolonging the war, and agreed for surrender. Accordingly his speech was recorded and went on air, where by he exhorted the people 'to prepare to bear the unbearable and suffer the insufferable'. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cThe Japanese\u201d didn\u2019t surrender; the Showa Emperor Hirohito directed his government to accept the Potsdam Declaration and announced this to the world on 14 August 1945. The military government of Japan thereupon resigned. The reason for this is a matter of some debate, but in our book, we took the position that the Showa, at long last, may have finally decided that it was better for him and his country to stop fighting and accept their fate\u2026better that than the extinction that Japan was headed for. If they kept at it, he realized there would be no Japanese left to worship the gods. What was the trigger for this realization? I think that the military finally pushed him over this edge, and it took until 10 August 1945 to hear it in person: they told him in council that there was no way to avoid the invasion of the Home Islands by the Soviets and Americans.

It took that long for the truth to sink in. ",
