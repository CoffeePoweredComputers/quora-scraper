            "answer_text": "It may surprise you that the Ottoman Turks, responsible for the \u2018second golden age\u2019, the resurgence of Islam from the Renaissance to early modernity, were indirect descendants of the Mongols of 1258. The descendants of the people who burned down the Baghdad library, expanded the borders of Islamic world to it\u2019s greatest extent. At the time of Genghis Khan, the mongols were not particularly religious. They worshipped something like Buddhism, but they never enforced their belief on the people they subjugated; they were actually rather tolerant of other religions and allowed their subjects to practice any faith they wanted. Indeed, when the Ilkhanate burned down Baghdad and conquered the Islamic world, they treated believers of all Abrahamic faith equally. By the late 1200\u2019s however, the rulers of the Khanate converted to Islam, partly to position themselves closer to the people they conquered. As a result, they became good Muslim rulers by enforcing taxes on Christians and Jews, rebuilding mosques, and launching wars against heathens in the name of Islam. In essence, after nearly destroying Islam, they sponsored it\u2019s rebirth. Even after the Mongols were replaced by other nomadic people, the lasting influence of Islam was felt by other would-be conquerors in Central Asia who would war in the name of Islam. ",
