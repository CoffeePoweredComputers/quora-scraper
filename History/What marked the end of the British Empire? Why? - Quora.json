            "answer_text": "Writer Saeed Akhtar has the answer. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre was the moment that signalled the end of the British Empire. Though that event concerned only India the country was so large and so populous that it was central to the concept of Empire. If India goes so would the Empire. More than the event itself it was the circumstances that led to the event and its aftermath that made it so significant. The massacre in Amritsar occurred in the 13 April 1919 exactly five months after the signing of the armistice that ended World War I in which 1.3 million Indian soldiers went to Europe and West Asia to fight for the Empire and 74000 of them died and a larger number returned home injured. Indian expected a thankful Britain to grant, as promised, a certain amount of self-rule in recognition of war effort. This did not happen. Indians in anger agitated and the British responded with the Rowlatt Act. The British never tired of telling Indians that they believed in the rule of law. This means that a person who breaks a law is charged, tried in open court where witnesses are examined and cross-examined, and punished if found guilty. The Rowlatt Act that was imposed to control the agitation in Punjab deviated widely from this much bandied about British concept of the rule of law. For certain proscribed political acts, the government can arrest without warrant, try the accused in camera where the accused neither knows the accuser nor the evidence used in the trial and can be detained indefinitely. There was a public outcry against such measures and in the agitations that ensued Mahatma Gandhi (who was just then becoming known after his return from South Africa) played a prominent role. But his call for non-violent agitation was not always observed and there were incidences of violence. The army was called in and the Acting Military Commander for Amritsar, Brigadier Reginald Dyer decided to teach Indians a lesson they will never forget. In defiance of the curfew, a crowded meeting was held in an enclosed garden in Amritsar called Jallianwala Bagh. It was really a gathering of the public for the festival of Baisakhi that had partly morphed into a public meeting where local prominent men spoke disapproving the action of the government in deporting two of their leaders. The crowd was unarmed and peaceful. All this did not matter to Dyer. Dyer marched in with 90 soldiers drawn from the Gurkha rifles and the Sikh and Sind Rifles. The only narrow entrance to the garden he blocked with his troops and without warning opened fire into the densest part of the crowd. When the crowd panicked and, in an attempt, to escape massed against some of the locked gates of the enclosure the firing was directed in that direction; when the crowd lay down flat the firing was directed downwards. Many jumped into a well in the enclosure as the only place free from flying bullets. The firing continued for ten minutes and stopped when the ammunition was exhausted. Dyer withdrew his soldiers and left. Of the dead and wounded he did not bother. \u2018Caring for them was not my job,\u2019 he said later. There is no eyewitness record to the scene of the carnage after the soldiers had gone. With a curfew in force, the unwounded must have helped the wounded to reach home or hospital. Relatives must have braved the curfew orders and come to search for the dead. More than 100 bodies were found in the well many of them no doubt dead of suffocation. In our mind\u2019s eye, we can see the deserted streets with a few miserable creatures limping along or being carried by relatives and friends to hospitals and mortuaries. The authorities made no effort to count the dead. Later researchers place the number of dead at 547. The event itself may be explained as the actions of a madman, but not the reaction of the Britishers in India and in Britain. To the rulers in India Dyer was a hero who saved India. He was honoured in Britain too. The newspaper, The Daily Mail, collected money for presentation to Dyer for his brave action. Such was the enthusiasm of the public that a small fortune was collected. A motion condemning his action failed to pass in the House of Lords. When a similar motion was tabled in the House of Commons the debate was so much in favour of Dyer\u2019s action that at one time it appeared as if the House of Commons will also approve the massacre. It was Winston Churchill\u2019s speech that day that turned the tide. He described the event as \u2018an extraordinary event, a monstrous event, an event which stands in singular and sinister isolation....\u2019 When the dust settled on Jallianwala Bagh massacre it was clear to Indians and their British rulers did not care one bit for the people they were ruling. Their countrymen who fought their wars were in Britisher\u2019s eyes mercenaries who joined the army for a livelihood. Maiming and death were occupation hazards of that job and nothing more. Canadians and Australians were different. They were brothers who shed their blood for their motherland. As for self-rule that was out of the question. India must remain a source for raw material and a repository for British manufactured goods. Self-ruled Indian would not permit that. General Dyer was removed from command and forced to retire. To his dying day, he believed that his action saved India. He died when he was 63 years old. If he had lived to 83, he would have witnessed Indian Independence. One wonders if he would have had the clarity of mind to be aware of the small part he once played in making it happen. This eye-opener for Indians coincided with the arrival of Mahatma Gandhi on the scene. The rest is history. Jallianwala Bagh was the first nail in the coffin of the British Empire. There was a second nail, and a third, but those stories are for another occasion. ",

            "answer_text": " \u201cGold and silver naturally resort to a rich country.\u201d- Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations. In the Year of Our Lord 1946 on 15th July, the signing of the Anglo-American Loan agreement [1] between Great Britain and the United States marks the unofficial end to the British Empire. The loan amount was for about US$5 billion to be used in Britain and her domain Canada, to pay for post-WWII expenses in the aftermath of the sudden cessation of the Lend-Lease Act on 2nd September 1945 (in conjunction with the surrender of Japan) which Britain had been tapping on to sustain her war efforts and rebuilding. There was a clause in the Anglo-American loan agreement which makes it mandatory for the British Empire to abolish exchanges controls within a year among her dominions and territories. The British Empire\u2019s exchange controls served to bind one quarters of humanity( about 700 million people) into a commonwealth of pound sterling International monetary system, propping up the Pound sterling as the official reserve Currency(besides gold) of the dominions in an exclusive but closed market of low custom duties and tariffs for internal trade within the realms of the Commonwealth. In short, Everyone under the sphere of Commonwealth realms are to use the pound sterling for commercial/trade settlement and it is the only official reserve allowed. This internal monetary system secures London as the global financial center for most part of the early 20th century when the pound sterling was made the world\u2019s first official foreign Currency reserve after the Genoa conference in 1922.[2] As Great Britain post-WWII external debt was six times her total gold and foreign exchange reserves, there was a mad rush by the British empire\u2019s individual dominions and territories (in addition to countries outside the British Empire) to sell off the pound sterling (in anticipation of rapid pound sterling depreciation) and buy the US dollar after 15 July 1947, when the abolition of exchange controls kicks in. This underpins US dollar strength which enable America to fully implement the Bretton Woods monetary system [3] to her advantage by making gold(the US holds 3/4 of global gold holdings) and the US dollar to be the only reserves currency for clearing settlement of international trade. The British Empire gradually disintegrate following the surrender of global financial hegemony to the United States. The rest, they say, is history. As of Q4 2016, global US Dollar Forex reserves stood at US$5 Trillion, 14 times the British Pound\u2019s US$349 Billion figure.[4]   Footnotes[1] Anglo-American loan - Wikipedia[2] Genoa Conference (1922) - Wikipedia[3] Bretton Woods system - Wikipedia[4] http://data.imf.org/?sk=E6A5F467-C14B-4AA8-9F6D-5A09EC4E62A4",
