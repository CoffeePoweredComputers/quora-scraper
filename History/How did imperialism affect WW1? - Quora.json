            "answer_text": "World War one started on the 28th of July 1914 between two sides; triple alliance and the triple entente. It ended on the 11th of November 1918. Difference in policies were to blame, although the immediate cause of World War one was the assassination of Austria\u2019s Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The war started mainly because of four aspects: Militarism, Alliances, Imperialism and Nationalism. This is because big armies become potential threats to other countries, other countries started forcing alliances in order to secure land. Imperialism was a cause because building an empire needs manpower such as an army and a navy to conquer and keep the land that they colonised. The alliances system meant that a local conflict could easily result into an intimidating global one. The overall cause of World War was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Nationalism was a great cause of World War one because of countries being greedy and not negotiating. Nationalism shows you are proud of your country and want it to be the best. A lot of causes all linked back to countries all wanted to be better than each other. Nationalist groups in Austria-Hungary and Serbia wanted independence. France wanted Alsace Lorraine back from Germany who was lost in 1871 Franco-Prussian war. The use of Nationalism gave nations false hope and aggressive to win the war. Even if they weren\u2019t able to win a war due to their strength and understanding of plans and leaders. This leads to Imperialism. As you can see Nationalism had made a big dent in Countries understanding and strength of war. Also how different countries wanted land to help their plan succeed in winning the war. One of the most significant causes of World War one was Imperialism, which is where a system where powerful nation rules and exploits one or more colonies. There are two main crisis\u2019s that occurred in Morocco in 1905 and 1911. In 1905, Kaiser visited Morocco in North Africa, where Germany was building up its own Empire. An international conference was held in 1906. At the conference Kaiser was humiliated, this made him fill with rage because he wanted to be seen as Major power in Africa. Instead, he was treated as if he had no right in speaking at the conference that was made global news. In 1911 France tried to take over Morocco again. Britain feared that Kaiser wanted to set up a naval base in Agadir. Another conference was held and the British and French stood up against Germany once again. France took control of Morocco and Germany was given land in central Africa as an act of compensation. These two events lead directly to Militarism. This was a significant cause of World War one because Kaiser was humiliated and could have felt determined to fight Britain and France earlier as an act of Revenge. Also, at the time he would have been more hostile. source : What was the most significant cause of World War One?

            "answer_text": "Imperialism, as wikipedia describes it, is \u201ca policy of extending a country's power and influence through diplomacy or military force.\u201d Using this definition imperialism mixed with nationalism is by a wide margin the biggest reason why ww1 started in the firstplace. The flashpoint of the war was when Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated by the 19 year old Serbian terrorist Gavrilo Princip, sparking what would then become known as the July crisis. As many prominent figures in the Austro-Hungarian government had been chomping at the bit to expand their influence into the small, relatively young Balkan nation of Serbia and despite the fact that most historians doubt that there was any actual connection between the Serbian government and the terrorist, in the Austrians minds this assassination gave them a casus belli to fulfill their imperialistic ambitions. The Austrians then delivered a demand that has become known as the July ultimatum. The ultimatum consisted of several demands that would essentially make Serbia a puppet of Austria-Hungary. Serbia's response was rejection, so Austria declared war on Serbia, calling their ally Germany into the fray and as the German Kaiser was enthusiastic about gaining land and prestige for their relatively new empire, Germany then declared war on Serbia. Russia meanwhile had stated that if Germany joined the war with Austria then the Russians would join on the side of the Serbs, and so Russia declared war on Germany. Russia also had an alliance with France, and after the humiliating defeat of the Franco-Prussian war France wanted to regain their honor and take back the coveted territory of Alsace Lorraine which the Prussians(now Germany) had conquered during that time, so France had now joined the Russia and Serbia. Germany knew it wouldn't be able to push through the defences on the shared border with France, so they activated what was called the Schlieffen plan. This plan detailed going around the French defenses by passing through Belgium whose independence was guaranteed by Britain, in spite of the threat of British retaliation Germany, wrongly thinking they would defeat France so quickly that the British would sue for peace, declared war on Belgium, dragging it and the British empire into the fray. This set the stage with on one side the entent(Britain and it's commonwealth, France, Russia, Serbia) and ont the other, the central powers(Germany Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, Ottomans)Italy would later join the entent shortly after declaring neutrality and breaking off the alliance it had previously had with Germany because it had imperialistic visions of it's own that took form of the Austrian controed province of South Tyrol. The war would kill people in the millions by its conclusion, but not before drawing in countless other nations either through treaties, trade interdiction(U.S.) or because of the original seed from which this apocalyptic plant grew: imperialism.

            "answer_text": "Imperialism was the dominant form of government prior to WWI. Imperialistic hubris contributed to the start of the war. Open communication probably would have stopped the war before it truly started. The imperial disregard for the lives of the lower classes allowed the Noble class officers to order human wave charges against machine guns. Of course, after the war, the only major monarchy to survive was England. The Monarchies of Germany, Austria and Russia were gone, with Italy soon to follow. ",
