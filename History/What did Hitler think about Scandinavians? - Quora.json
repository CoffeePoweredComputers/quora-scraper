            "answer_text": "Hitler did not say much about the Scandinavians. What he said about them was that he considered them the ideal Aryans or perfect Germanics. Hitler loved Scandinavians. He wanted to make his Germans as pure like the Scandinavians. However, he also considered them naive and sort of soft. This he blamed on Christianity. For example, he feared that if the Jews ever made it that far north, the Scandinavians would be easily manipulated and exploited. Hitler respected he Scandinavians but did not fully trust the Danes and Norwegians. He ordered the invasion of Denmark and Norway in order to secure his northern flank before Winston Churchill could invade and occupy Norway (but it failed). Not all Scandinavians were neutral or anti-Nazi. Many joined the Waffen SS and formed divisions to fight the Russians. Also thousands of babies were born to Norwegian mothers from German fathers.

            "answer_text": "Sure he thought of then as Scandinavian. German propaganda used Viking imagery all the time and so had to embrace Scandinavian culture. Some of the images called on Scandinavians fight alongside Germany against the USSR.     Add to that the fact that the Finns were allied with Hitler early on (mostly out of fear of the USSR). And don\u2019t forget unit like 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking. Hitler\u2019s rhetoric made it so he sort of had to embrace Scandinavian, which made his invasion of Norway extra problematic as it called on him to fight a people he could not use his usual demeaning propaganda against.
