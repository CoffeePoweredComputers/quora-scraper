            "answer_text": "We really have no way of knowing until he actually does the job.  Either way whatever he does, his haters will probably consider him to be a bad president and there will be just as many who will support him and consider him a good president.  As long as i have been old enough to understand politics, i have really not experienced much positive changes in my life under any of the last few presidents.  They all seem like they make a bunch of promises that are impossible to carry out because they already made more important promises to their corporate backers.  None of the presidents are really able to think for themselves and do what they want or what they envision.  The Parties want someone who will take orders and not upset the established order of things which has for years provided cushy jobs and lifestyles for thousands of elite types, at the expense of the rest of the American people.  I don't think there is any one president who everyone will agree is the worst.  There's plenty of people i know who think Obama is the worst, and just as many will say Bush was definitely more worse.  History will be remembered differently by various people, but i think Obama promised a bunch of things that he totally ended up doing the opposite of when he came down to it(bailing out the banks, getting our troops home, not starting more wars, hope and change).  It has now been 8 years and not much has changed except it seems like there is more racism and everybody is hung up about political correctness.  We do have Obamacare, and for me personally, health insurance costs so much i can't even afford it.  Doing my taxes this year i chose to pay the $695 penalty which by far was the cheaper option.  Obama had many good intentions, but i just thought a lot of his actions had nothing to do with the benefit of Americans.  He emphasized that we should welcome the Syrian refugees, despite the US having huge numbers of homeless people, unemployed, and starving children here at home.  We have more and more locked up in prisons and addicted to drugs and our own kids being abused by sex traffickers.  I would not say he was the worst president but he has been largely ineffective, and lacking a clear vision for us, and not having the right priorities in order.  Bush made a lot of bad decisions in the interest of national security but he at least got done what he intended, 9/11 gave him an agenda and before that people were just seeing him as a guy who did not really win the popular vote.  Bush handled numerous  things incorrectly and left a horrible situation for Obama and everyone had the false hope that Obama would actually change things and fix the problems that plague our nation, but instead he disappointed us by just perpetuating the problems left by Bush and some would argue that things are even worse now.  After all that, i highly doubt Trump would be the worst president in history, but i am pretty sure Hillary might be if she gets elected.  This is a woman whose most notable accomplishment is marrying a former president.  Anything she has attempted in politics has led to disaster and contributed to our whole entitlement culture of victimhood and neglecting personal responsibility.  These established politicians they never really solve problems or address the real issues that are the source of our major problems.  Trump is the only candidate who wants to put America's interests and security first ahead of all other countries in the world.  There is no reason why America should be interfering in the affairs of other countries or dictating how to govern.  Many of these countries don't see what we all see at home.  America has plenty of problems to fix at home, and too many politicians are out of touch and act like we have an obligation to help all the suffering people everywhere except the ones in America.   They prefer to keep the corporate donors happy and their only concern is being re elected because most of them who have been politicians their whole lives sadly would not be able to work a real job if not elected again.   Trump will most likely handle the job of president like he would handle most jobs, with a goal of success and with the intentions of benefitting America the most.  Even if he does not quite accomplish all his goals, i am quite confident that American lives will have improved, more will be employed, and our economy will be better.  This guy has declared bankruptcy numerous times and was able to bring his company out of it to prosperity once again.  Some will argue the government is way different than managing a business but i would disagree because many of the basic principles of running a successful business can be applied to all aspects of life including our government.   Trump wants to cut our debt, stop illegal immigration, and stop our jobs from going to other countries where the labor is cheaper.  Just those three things got worse during Obama's presidency and dragged us further into debt.  Obama probably did not intend these things but he just had the wrong vision and unfortunately he did not consider that many Americans would suffer in the pursuit of his legacy.  He lost his message and just told himself that America was already great and that he had brought upon essential changes that are good for society as a whole, like gay marriage equality and letting nonviolent drug offenders out of life sentences.  Good accomplishments for sure but only impacting the lives of a select few and not following through afterwards.  Trump may not accomplish all his goals but at least he will have an endgame in mind and he will put America's needs first above all others, which in my opinion is the appropriate presidential vision that we have never seen.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s funny because for many of the same reasons that Trump\u2019s most devoted fans say that he\u2019s the best, most amazing, most efficient and effective president we\u2019ve ever had (statements that sound exactly like something our narcissistic president would say), we can\u2019t really say that he\u2019s the worst president we\u2019ve ever had either. He hasn\u2019t finished his first term. There hasn\u2019t been sufficient time to evaluate the consequences of the actions and policies he\u2019s taken. But we can certainly start to evaluate. For instance, in presidential ranking polls of academic historians and political scientists, he\u2019s been ranked dead last once and third-to-last once (Historical rankings of presidents of the United States - Wikipedia). We can also look at some of the measures that people typically use for presidents to get some ideas of where he\u2019s at (I also wrote a bunch about this in a different answer: Zachary Newell's answer to Where does Donald Trump rank amongst the greatest Presidents of all time?): Major milestones, the types of events and moments of leadership that define great presidencies of people like FDR, Lincoln, and Washington. Trump hasn\u2019t had any. This means that, so far, he can\u2019t make it into the top tiers of presidents.Major pieces of legislation or policy that fundamentally improve the nation. The only major legislation passed under Trump was a tax cut that primarily benefited the rich (thereby violating one of his campaign promises). This means that, so far, he can\u2019t really make it into, say, the upper half of presidents.Diplomatic initiatives and alliances; Trump so far has sunk confidence in the US for almost all of our traditional allies, only managing to make Saudi Arabia sort of happy (and Congress has gone against him on it). Okay, now he\u2019s definitely in the bottom half.In addition to the above, he\u2019s also made overtures to figures like Putin and Kim Jong-Un\u2026giddy overtures, the contents of which aren\u2019t always publicly known (or even known to Congress or our intelligence agencies) that severely strain credibility for our values of democracy, freedom, and human and civil rights. Now Trump is sinking into the bottom quarter.Social unity: great presidents do their best to unite the country and work for the betterment of all. Trump has most emphatically failed at this\u2026and has done so very deliberately and intentionally. He is an intensely divisive figure, something that he strives for as part of his reality TV presidency. At this point Trump is solidly in the bottom quarter of presidencies and sinking further.As part of the above, Trump has been very weak on demographic issues, encouraging, through words and deeds, discrimination based on gender, gender identity, race, national origin, and religion. Trump is now in the bottom ten, easily.Despite popular support and scientific/expert backing for a wide range of policies like universal healthcare, climate change mitigation, and economic readjustment away from supply-side economics, Trump has spearheaded going against all of those and more. His overall prioritization of feelings and loyalty over facts and experience creates a lack of competency in his administration that shows. Solidly in the bottom ten now.Trump is a bully, using his platform to spew hatred against any who disagree with him. He\u2019s assaulted the free press as well as basic facts. This sinks him into the bottom five.He lies, lies, lies, and lies some more (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims-database/?utm_term=.f570736c661d). I\u2019d say that this likely puts him at the bottom of the bottom five\u2026but still with some room to float a bit.He has a history of extremely shady business dealings, including using his inherited wealth and bullying tactics to stiff contractors, customers, and investors. And if it turns out that there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing while in office (and/or if more comes out about his dealings beforehand), I\u2019d definitely put him at dead last, no question.ADDED (11/3/19): to expand upon the previous point, there is a growing pool of evidence that says that Trump has committed crimes and/or misdemeanors. The Mueller Report document 10 counts of obstruction of justice, action on which was thwarted by DoJ policy against indicting a sitting President and by Attorney General Barr\u2019s shameful twisting of the report\u2019s conclusions in a press conference. However, the House has taken up an impeachment inquiry based on increasing evidence that Trump used his position to demand personal political assistance from a foreign government, using Congressionally-approved defense funding as a bargaining chip. It is likely that the House will vote to impeach Trump for abuse of power, violations of emoluments (foreign and, potentially, domestic), and obstruction of justice (both the obstruction that Mueller found along with Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine the impeachment inquiry). And while it is equally likely that the Senate will not have enough votes to remove him from office, unless the evidence against Trump turns out to be far thinner than expected, I think this whole ordeal really will put Trump firmly at the bottom. After all, figures like Buchanan and Johnson may have been crappy at their jobs, but they didn\u2019t go to nearly the self-serving lengths as Trump has.ADDED: Impeachment: Trump is the third president to be impeached, based on solid evidence of abuse of office and obstruction of justice (and they didn\u2019t even impeach him based on what Mueller found) that may not be acknowledged by certain media outlets but will be taken very seriously by historians. Not only that, but his trial in the Senate was a rapid and shallow affair where many of those that voted to acquit him admitted openly that they knew he was guilty of what he was impeached for but didn\u2019t want to pay the political price to do their jobs. Also, the president\u2019s allies in the Senate refused to allow witness testimony, which would have made his guilt far more obvious and would have had political repercussions for them. So not only will Trump be solidly at the bottom of rankings for the actions that triggered impeachment, his allies will also be looked upon poorly by historians for putting party politics above the law.ADDED: Performance in a crisis: one of the only Presidents to rank below Trump in the eyes of several historians is James Buchanan, who is largely saddled with blame for poor performance in the looming crisis that led to the Civil War. Up until now, Trump had not truly faced a national crisis (like George W. Bush\u2019s responding to 9/11 or Barack Obama responding to the Great Recession) that could decisively put him above or below someone like Buchanan. We already knew that Trump did not perform well in the face of natural disasters\u2026but with the COVID-19 pandemic, he has shown critical failures as a leader. First, he dismantled the mechanisms set up to help us effectively deal with a pandemic. He then delayed action when the threat appeared, tossing out conspiracy theories and claiming that the virus wasn\u2019t a problem. And even after acknowledging the problem (and, unbelievably, saying that he knew the scale of danger all along), he has subverted almost every effort to effectively combat the spread of the disease. And to add to that, he, unlike almost any other president, has categorically refused to take responsibility for his actions and insists on blaming anyone and everyone else, showing a childish inability to lead. The US became a hotspot for COVID-19 when it didn\u2019t have to (we had months to prepare), has had many more cases and deaths than it should have, and risks serious resurgences of the virus because of Trump\u2019s incompetence. While some historians may continue to find Buchanan and/or Johnson worse, I find it almost impossible that Trump would be rated above the very bottom among most historians after such an abysmal failure in a crisis.So I\u2019d say that he isn\u2019t literally the worst president we\u2019ve ever had\u2026we can\u2019t say that yet\u2026but while there are still opportunities for him to rise above such vaunted figures as Buchanan and Johnson, it\u2019s pretty safe to say at this point that he\u2019s one of the worst presidents we\u2019ve ever had and will likely end up at the very bottom of the list for a very long time. EDIT 11/3/19: added a point about the Mueller Report and the ongoing impeachment inquiry. EDIT 5/29/20: added points about impeachment and COVID-19 and updated my conclusion slightly as a result. ",
