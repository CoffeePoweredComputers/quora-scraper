            "answer_text": "Peter the Apostle is frequently mentioned in the four Gospels, and one of the two main figures in the Acts of the Apostles. He also has brief mentions in Paul\u2019s Letter to the Galatians. Moreover, he himself wrote a surviving letter, the First Epistle of Peter. In the introduction of that letter, the author introduces himself. Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ Therefore, we (historians) can be certain that: There was a man named Peter the Apostle who lived in first-century PalestineHe was one of the original followers of JesusAnd accompanying details (the fact that he denied Jesus, for instance, is in all 4 of the gospels)And a central figure of the early ChurchAnd accompanying details(that he was the main spokesman for the Apostles, for instance)Historians are uncertain: Whether he founded the Church in RomeOf the details surrounding his deathOf course, these may be true as well, but we do not have original sources for these claims.  A few common questions/concerns: But all those sources are from the Bible. Do those count? Absolutely. Don\u2019t let the big \u201cB\u201d word scare you. The Bible is merely a collection of old historical documents. Basically, imagine someone took a whole bunch of letters and biographies from the original church and stapled them together. Obviously the act of stapling does not suddenly make everything written on those pages false. It also doesn\u2019t make them true (for those who will complain I\u2019m getting into a faith-based argument) Each document in the collection must still be assessed based on its individual historical merit, not on the fact that it\u2019s part of this collection. In the case of the Christian New Testament, it is the most well-verified historical documents in the ancient world. In fact, it beats its competitors by several orders of magnitude. Comparing to say, the works of Tacitus, we have 1000 times as many manuscripts, and they are about 900 years closer in historical proximity. Why are there only 7 sources for Peter\u2019s life? Shouldn\u2019t there be hundreds? To put this into comparison, the Roman Emperor at the time, Tiberius, has only 4 contemporary historical accounts of his life. The following Emperor, Caligula, has 2. When you have as much written about you as the Emperor of Rome, we can be pretty sure you were a figure of some importance. What does this mean for religion/atheism? Frankly, not much. It doesn\u2019t take much zealotry either way to believe that the man who lived in the first century, followed Jesus, and helped found the Christian Church was *gasp* named Peter. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a fair few historical documents from his time that mention him - mostly in the Bible, but that doesn\u2019t automatically make them less reliable. The early church said that these documents were a reliable record of how it began, and that\u2019s why they included them. Two of those documents purport to be written by Peter himself, but with the help of a Greek-speaker in each case. One of those is generally considered to be likely to be genuine (the letter known as 1 Peter); the other is considered less likely, but still possible (the letter known as 2 Peter). There is also a longer document from the first century, which a second century source tells us was Peter\u2019s memoirs, written up by his friend Mark. This is generally known as Mark\u2019s gospel, and pretty much everyone agrees it was at least based on eyewitness testimony of the events and written during the probable lifetime of Peter - Peter died c AD68, and Mark had to be written before the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in AD70. In any case, Mark and the other gospels are clearly written as an attempt at a historical account of events, and they record a man called Peter being one of Jesus\u2019 close followers. On a purely historical basis, it seems overwhelmingly likely that Jesus lived, and that he had a follower called Peter who was killed in Rome. It is certainly the clearest and best explanation of the state of the church afterwards. There\u2019s also the small issue of Peter\u2019s tomb (under the Vatican in Rome). It\u2019s not quite as well-attested as St Paul\u2019s tomb, but there\u2019s clear evidence that it was regarded as a genuine site long before Christianity became legal. ",
