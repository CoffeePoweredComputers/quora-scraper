            "answer_text": "Many, many countries simply don't trust Russia and their supposed expansionist goals hence the \"need\" to join NATO. NATO membership essentially guarantees a few options: 1. Security from the wealthiest, most powerful country on the globe. Eg, the US is spending about $3 billion on reinforcing Europe, or more specifically the Baltic states, for additional equipment, brigades, etc.2. Being allowed to \"slack off\" on their defense budget. If I'm not mistaken, NATO nations are \"suggested\" to pay 2% of their GDP on defense. If they weren't NATO members I suspect they would be paying more than 2%, but that's for a different day.3. Upgrading and training of their forces and being allowed to be sold certain weapons otherwise restricted to those nations. Pretty good deal? I'd say so. And no, the listed three aren't restricted to the Baltic states but across Europe. Best Regards, Demetrius Hicks ",

            "answer_text": "First off, all of the Baltic states joined NATO. And most of it boils down to protection. Former Communist Eastern Europe, and the Baltics in particular, wanted to get as far away from Russia as possible. Keep in mind that for the Baltics, the USSR not only invaded these countries, but integrated the countries into the Union and tried to destroy their culture and replace it with Russian/Communist culture. And the average citizen of Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania are still very weary, if not fearful, of Russia. The Ukraine conflict just recently only heightened these fears; among all of the members of NATO, the Baltics and Eastern European countries reacted with the most hostility. So with NATO, the Baltic states get Western protection from Russia, so Russia could not annex a part of Estonia with a large Russian population without retaliation, per se. ",
