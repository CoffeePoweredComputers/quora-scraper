            "answer_text": "The Genocide of the Tamils When the brutes in war bombs on the hapless Tamils rained, When they the butchery of the innocent Tamils continued, When women and children were maimed, slaughtered, When Tamil youth were abused, cindered and murdered When the hapless humanity in agony wailed and perished, Unspeakable horrors and the torments of the Hades unleashed On helpless women and children behind barbed fence unarmed, When the few of us inconsolably wept and copious tears shed, Battered, blood-splattered men wounded, had groaned, The rotting corpses of the men and women lay exposed, On flesh from bones shredded the kites and carnivores fed, A sea of humanity in squalor lived, one by one were shot, In Auschwitz-style, eyes covered, hands tied, body nude, By armed barbarians because the victims Tamil spoke, In holocaust of a pogrom planned and executed by brutes, In the land of the Tamils, the men who mattered did not protest. The Mother of Parliament had been for a debate pressed Whilst here within a stone's throw, conscience was suppressed, In the land of Tamils suddenly the queer things had happened, All the smaller parties did protest but Govt never its mouth opened. It happened within a stone's throw of our land; But our Rulers their back on the carnage turned. It was bruited that they too lent a covert hand, Deathly ammo and satellite info they supplied. The war-ravaged victims on our support had much reckoned; But deathly silence in our land they hardly had envisioned. We all wondered whether one man's death was avenged With more than a million lives of men, women and children. Killing an enemy in the battle-field is not held a crime of war; But dropping bombs on and killings of civilians unarmed were, And killing innocent children and raping women are crimes of war. But History does not take kindly to these brute merchants of death. It's often seen that hoofed devils meet with not dissimilar Fate From that of the innocent people who they killed for mere sport. A conspiracy of silence of the Government in our land ensued, Which the slaughter of millions of our own kind had encouraged, The Janus-faced politicos put on a sly make-believe dharna, No one in the country at all was impressed by this jejune drama. The Government at the Centre hardly ever uttered even a word Even though in the far shores of England protest-marches were held. My friend even now we don\u2019t see how persecuted are we! By the time you get wise enough, our race would extinct be. Forget not the honour, the grandeur and the glory of your past, That which you were in the past is still there within you right Wallow not in obsequious beggary oblivious of your might, Arise, awake and lead with head held high and straight gait ! Vazhga Thamizh! Valarga Thamizh Makkal!! ",

            "answer_text": "There was the Katyn Forest Massacre (in 1940)  where the Soviet NKVD took captured Polish Army Officers, Academics, Police Officers and even Boy Scouts (anyone who could resist them) out and murdered them. Several thousand actually. They then blamed it on the Germans, but nobody at the Nuremberg Trials believed them. ",
