            "answer_text": "The call from Sans says that The Underground has acquired a new ruler. Due to the lack of anyone else qualified, Papyrus becomes the king of the underground. When seemingly asked by the player why Sans didn't take the position, Sans says he\u2019s too lazy. And yet he later states in the call that he does all the behind the scenes paperwork so Papyrus doesn't get his spirit crushed. Papyrus ends up taking over the call and says how he thinks Alphys, Undyne and Mettaton are on a holiday together. But, he sadly mentions, they haven't responded to any of his daily voicemails, so he suspects they aren't ever coming back. Sans guilt trips you about Toriel to end off, and hangs up. ",
