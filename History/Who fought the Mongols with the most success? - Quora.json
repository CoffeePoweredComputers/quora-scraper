            "answer_text": "Several empires and kingdoms were able to repel the Mongols, most often, due to Lady Luck siding with the defender (example: Mongol invasions of Japan [1] and Battle of Ain Jalut [2]), but, Alauddin Khilji, the second ruler of the Khilji Dynasty of Delhi holds the rare distinction of being one of the very few, who not only repelled the Mongols (several times) but actually launched punitive raids against them.  \u200b Allaudin Khilji. The first battle between Khilji\u2019s forces and the Mongols of the Chagatai Khanate (the Mongol empire was split into 4 Khanates [3] ), was fought near Jalandhar, Punjab in 1297. Khilji\u2019s Armies ,commanded by the brilliant Zafar Khan thrashed the Mongol invasion force, killing nearly 20,000 of them and taking hundreds of prisoners. Not ones to give up, the Mongols struck again the next year near Sindh (Modern South-East Pakistan) and were again beaten back with heavy losses. In 1299, the Mongols attacked again. This time, they headed straight for Delhi, Khilji\u2019s capital. The Mongols usually deployed around 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers for most of their invasions depending more on the mobility and hardiness of their troops rather than on numerical strength to beat their enemies, but this time, they numbered more than 150,000 men; a huge invasion force by Mongol standards. Hearing reports of the Mongol army\u2019s strength,most of Khilji\u2019s ministers developed cold feet and asked him to negotiate a peace with the Mongols and to accept whatever their demands were. Everyone knew that, if the Mongols won, there would be no mercy for anyone. However, Khilji outright refused to even listen to their advice and prepared to personally lead the counter-attack. The Sultanate and Mongol forces met on the field of Kili(near Tughlakabad, Delhi) and a great battle ensued. Both sides suffered terrible losses, but in the end, the Mongols were routed (put to flight) and once again, the Delhi Sultanate had emerged victorious. Unfortunately, Zafar Khan, (the hero who had repelled the earlier invasions) was killed in an ambush. The drubbing they received at Kili subdued the Mongols for a while, but soon enough they resumed their offensives. Under a new leader, Targhi, they managed to lay siege to Delhi, at a time when Khilji was doing much the same in Chittor, Rajasthan. Most of Khilji\u2019s nobles failed to send troops on time, so Khilji retreated to Siri, a formidable fort that he had built for just such a situation. After repeated attempts to storm the fort failed, the Mongols withdrew to Central Asia. The surprise attack on Delhi showed that in order to stop the Mongols, new fortifications would have to be built in the border regions i.e. The Punjab and Sindh. However, mere fortifications had never stopped the finest horse archers of history and the mighty border forts of Punjab couldn\u2019t either; the Mongols simply bypassed them and set out plundering and looting the inhabitants of Punjab. This time, Khilji decided that he was going to give the Mongols a taste of their own medicine. To this end, he sent his finest general, Malik Kafur, a eunuch- slave (those were common in Muslim empires) and his lover (yup!), to lay an ambush. The loot-laden Mongols walked right into it and the battle of Amroha ensued. The Mongols who were numerically inferior and lightly equipped, were badly beaten and the Mongol general along with 9,000 prisoners was captured. The poor general was later trampled to death by elephants; a bad way to die, if you ask me. Even this failed to deter the Mongols and in 1306, they were back, crossing the Indus near the modern day city of Multan, Pakistan. They were stopped at the banks of the Ravi River and were defeated yet again by Malik Kafur. 50,000 prisoners were captured and were summarily executed. The nearly annual Mongol raids into his territory had forced Khilji to build fortifications and garrison troops near major cities and in the border regions, but even these measures failed to deter the obdurate Mongols. So, Khilji decided that he was going to go on the offensive. To this end, he assembled troops in Delhi and formed them into raiding parties and sent them into Mongol held territory in Afghanistan. Although, the raids were beaten back, the punitive expeditions showed that not only could the Mongols be beaten , but could even be attacked. This show of force by Khilji riled up the Mongols, and in 1307, they tried one last time to take Delhi. The invading army was sighted by border patrols and the entire force was slaughtered to a man by the Sultanate\u2019s border troops. To prevent the Mongols from any more misadventures in the region,Khilji decided to use the intelligence gathered from the last expeditionary raid on the Mongols to launch a strike on their strongholds and bases in Afghanistan. He hoped that by crippling these, the Mongols raids would be stopped once and for all. Khilji was proved right in this and his counter-offensive was a success. The damage done to their bases in Afghanistan and the crisis ensuing during the Mongol succession (the Chagatai Khanate\u2019s leader had died that year) prevented the Mongols from launching raids into India for over 13 years. So, we see that Allaudin Khilji defeated the Mongols several times and launched his own counter-offensives against them. He was most definitely a pain in the neck for the Mongols. Footnotes:- [1] The two Mongol invasions of Japan were prevented because Typhoons sunk most of the invasion fleet and the survivors were cut down by the Japanese. These typhoons were later called as Kamikaze or divine winds. Please check Angela Yay\u2019s answer on this page for more info. (Angela Yay's answer to Who fought the Mongols with the most success? ) [2] The Mamelukes of Egypt won the Battle Of Ain Jalut because they had a significant numerical advantage over the Mongols. Most of the Mongol Army, which was poised to invade Egypt had returned to Mongolia along with Hulagu Khan after he received news that the Great Khan had died. Being a potential successor himself, he had to return home immediately with the bulk of his forces. Seizing the opportunity, the Mamelukes attacked with a huge force.The remaining 10,000 or so Mongols led by a Christian commander called Kitbuqa resisted bravely, but the numerical superiority of the Mameluke was too great. Most of the Mongols including the general himself were killed. [3] The Mongol Empire was split into 4 parts: the Mongol-founded Yuan Dynasty in China, the Chagatai Khanate, the Golden Horde that controlled Central Asia and Russia, and the Ilkhans of Persia.

            "answer_text": "Who fought the Mongols with the most success? in the end EVERYBODY! barbarians are usually only successful against civilizations when those centers of power are disorganized or waning. had the Mongols faced a united and determined China when Genghis Khan 1st attacked they would have been crushed which is what in fact happened as time went on. in 1368 after less than 100 years of occupation the Chinese were able to drive the Mongols out of their country. had the Mongols forgotten how to fight in that century? No! the Chinese just united and had competent military leadership. 20 years after driving the Mongols out of China the Chinese invaded Mongolia and destroyed the Mongol capital and other cities. where were all those super Mongol warrior hordes? shouldn\u2019t they have prevented that invasion of their homeland? it\u2019s the same story for many of the Mongol attacks. in their 1st invasions they deal with incompetent opponents and appear unstoppable. as time went on the opposition learns from their mistakes they are able to repel invasions or to drive the Mongol forces out of their countries. the Mongols no longer appear invincible but are beaten on a regular basis. All the military prowess of the Mongol Super Soldiers the fanboy\u2019s rave about seem to have totally degraded! of course it helped when the Mongols engaged in internecine conflict. the Mongol \u2018empire\u2019 was built on speed and luck, when their luck ran out the \u2018empire\u2019 collapsed with speed as well and left nothing lasting behind but a legacy of brutality. it should also be noted that despite the revisionist historians claims, the Mongols were engaged in their wars of aggression for no other reason than for loot. they had no political or religious agenda motivating them. their empire was built totally on a predatory/parasitic basis. they had no interest in their subjugated populations except as a source of revenue. they had nothing to offer people but extermination or subjugation. when Mongol rule collapsed the Mongols were largely driven out of the lands that were once part of their empire. the Tatars, Turks and Kazakhs who set up states after the collapse of the Mongol empire would have NEVER thought of themselves as redoubts or rump outposts of a government in Mongolia. in terms of language, culture, religion and ethnically, they had nothing in common with Mongols or the former \u201cempire\u201d.
