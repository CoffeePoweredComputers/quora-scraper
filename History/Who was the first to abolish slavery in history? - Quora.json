            "answer_text": "Why do I take from your question that it is about the US? In fact, Great Britain abolished slavery in 1833. A full thirty years before the US. We were rather late to the party. Contrary to the myth, Lincoln did not free the slaves with his Emancipation Proclamation. He only freed slaves in The Confederacy. He was trying to win a war. To that end, he famously stated that if he could win the war without freeing a single slave, he would. He wanted support from the border states. It was all political. ",

            "answer_text": "The state of Vermont (which was an indecent republic after the revolutionary war) was the first country to abolish slavery outright in 1777. In 1792 Denmark abolished the slave trade to its colonies. Throughout the beginning of the 19the century, most European countries follow suit. Slavery in the West isn\u2019t abolished until late 19the century, with the US, Cuba, and eventually Brazil. In 1948 the UN included that no human should be held in slavery in their declaration of human rights. ",
