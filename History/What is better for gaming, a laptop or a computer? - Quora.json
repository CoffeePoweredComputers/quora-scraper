            "answer_text": "Gaming laptops are becoming more popular today: they are chosen, including as a replacement for PCs. How equal are these options? Despite all the efforts of game console manufacturers, people in the world still prefer to play on a PC. Why a computer? It is pretty simple. More games Of course, gaming consoles have their own exclusives, but in terms of the number of games, none of them can compare with a computer. Any peripherals can be used. There is no compatibility issue here - you buy any joystick or steering wheel you like and connect it without any problems. The possibility of an upgrade You can always (or almost always) add RAM, replace the HDD with a fast SSD - in other words, create a configuration for comfortable gaming. Mod support Mods are game modifiers. In addition to the prohibited ones, there are a bunch of completely legal ones that allow you to customize the gameplay, improve the interface, and so on. The computer is not just for play. The device is universal: you can play for an hour or two, and then switch to work or household chores. Now, in fact, the main question: computer or laptop? Five years ago, such question was not even raised. Today the performance of gaming laptops has reached the level of PC. So which one to prefer?  Gaming computers: pros and cons The main trump card of a desktop computer is a simpler upgrade and the ability to use a large monitor. Yes, you can connect a monitor to a gaming laptop as well, but the difference is that for a PC you buy one anyway. Will you decide on additional expenses, having already spent a lot on a laptop? Speaking of permissions, gaming laptops are still running at 1080p, which is again a head start in favour of PCs. Of course, a lot depends on the configuration of your computer. Many people focus on the processor and RAM, forgetting about the most important component for a gamer: a video card. It is the video card that is the heart of the gaming machine. When choosing a configuration, pay special attention to the video card: a PC with an Intel Core i5 + GeForce RTX 2080 in the vast majority of cases will cope with modern games better than the Intel Core i7 + GeForce RTX 2070. The disadvantages of a desktop computer are clear: it is installed permanently, and you cannot take it with you. You can't even go to another room - in fact, the gamer is tied to a specific place. Gaming laptops: pros and cons And what about the laptops? As I have already said, in terms of performance, they practically caught up with the PCs. Modern gaming laptops are quite lightweight and compact notes. If the Full HD resolution suits you perfectly, and the diagonal of 15-17 inches is enough, besides, your lifestyle is more inclined towards mobile devices, feel free to take a laptop. Indeed, they actually have the same processors, the same latest RTX cards with support for ray tracing and artificial intelligence technologies (such as DLSS smart anti-aliasing). True, there are not so many upgrade options: as a rule, you can only increase the RAM and replace the traditional hard drive with an SSD on your own. Still, the main advantage of a laptop is its portability. You can take it with you on trips, visit a friend, even lock yourself in the next room so as not to disturb other family members. Verdict: PC or laptop? If you play mainly at home and want to buy a large monitor and have ample opportunities for upgrading (so as not to change your computer after 3-4 years), take a desktop. For those who do not stay at home and who are unprincipled with ultra-high settings, a laptop is quite suitable: it will be comparable in cost to a desktop PC of similar performance, but you can carry it with you.

            "answer_text": "Gaming laptops are great in theory but they have some drawbacks: Firstly they are much harder, or more expensive to upgrade. With a gaming PC you can slot in a newer component to improve performance or keep up to date with the latest advanced graphics cards etc. With gaming laptops this is much harder because so often one has to dismantle the whole device, or there isn't enough physical space to swap things out for newer versions. Second, and this is important, is endurance. A gaming PC has lots of empty space in it, and that is a wonderful thing to have when it comes to cooling. Inside a laptop everything is crammed together and the airflow is confined to specific pathways. Dust and other contaminants with make their way into those pathways and eventually affect performance. Furthermore, if you intend to play games for very long periods of time then the heat from the GPU and CPU can overwhelm the system and cause performance slowdown, followed by damage to the components. It is harder to maintain the internal environment through cleaning because of the dismantling issues mentioned above. On top of those, there is power supply. I've stopped buying pre-built computers now, but when I did I don't think I ever got one with an adequate power supply. The PSU was always the first thing I had to upgrade and with a laptop this happens to be one of the things that is very expensive, or impossible to replace. Using a battery to operate a gaming laptop is almost a waste of effort - because it is only possible to draw a certain amount of power from a battery (without damaging it) and it generates heat while in use thus adding to the load of the already-inadequate cooling system. Conclusion: short duration, high performance gameplay is possible on a laptop. The laptop takes up less space while being stored and you can take it round to a friend's house for a games night without much effort. A gaming PC is much more practical and enduring for all other purposes ",
