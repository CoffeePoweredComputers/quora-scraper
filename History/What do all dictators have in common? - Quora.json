            "answer_text": "All Dictators have either had the support of the masses, or the support of the few with some clout (military, business classes, dominant ethnic group, etc.) in the initial stage of their reign. The masses need not be of the majority, but can be on tribal loyalties. Once their power is consolidated, steps are taken to ensure that it stays so, generally through shows of force, and purges of some of the elites. Some means of surveillance is set up, with an illusion of omniscience and brutality (the latter is real) to discourage dissent and revolts. Dictators in general are not tolerant of public dissent, for it is seen as a sign of weakness, a process out of control. At best, it is tolerated in the form of \u201csuggestions\u201d of the select few. Dictatorial regimes can\u2019t allow for institutions stronger than their own. That means a weak judiciary, weak parliament and a highly controlled, restricted military. This can be through surveillance of senior officials, as done by the NKVD/OGPU in Stalin\u2019s era. Popular military leaders are rightly feared by dictators. In some cases, a parallel military unit is formed, each one checking the other. Examples of this are the Revolutionary Guard of Iran, or the Saudi Arabian National Guard, or the SS. Such units are often fanatically loyal to the dictator, and are a means to ensure that the military would think twice before a coup, due to the assured bloodbath. Lastly, dictators spring up in times of instability and dissatisfaction, and the only way they can hope to stay relevant and in power, is by militarization and mass mobilization using the fear of a common enemy of the existential sort, one where survival is at stake, where fear dominates, instead of the more dreary issues of hunger and unemployment.Such issues are used to justify their reign, and continual support ensues. The main problem faced by dictators (barring their mortality) is that they can\u2019t hope to stay on, or stay alive unless they do all or some of the above, but that ensures the beginnings of dissatisfaction and future revolt. Only in a few cases has there been a relatively smooth transition of power. Damned if they do, and damned if they don\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "They have, I would suggest, the following in common. 1) They successfully instill an insane irratonal fear in those who would be thier subjects. They must NEVER let up, unease must ooze from them. The people must always wonder, \u201cAm I next?\u201d 2) They must have parallel lines of terror. These lines must terrorize each other, as well as the subjects. They must also jostle for supremacy. 3) The tyrant must have expanding and contracting circle of sycophants. The circle expands and contracts due to purges and additions. 4) The tyrant must be convinced of his genius. Hitler served as a message runner in the trenches during the GW , Yet he thought himself to being a military genius. Stalin's claim to fame was a bank robber and agitator. Yet, he intimidated Zhukov, who was a real military genius, into calling him a \u201cmilitary genius.\u201d 5) The tyrant must have instruments of coercion, i.e., secret police and prisons, known for torture and lingering death. 6) He must have written books and/or phamplets that showcase his genius. Said writings must be required reading, and if need be memorized. They're more, but, I would invite response for the sake of dialogue. ",
