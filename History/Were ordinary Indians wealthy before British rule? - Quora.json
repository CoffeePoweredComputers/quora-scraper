            "answer_text": "Technically British rule started from 1857. However, I will consider a longer period of 1757 (Battle of Plassey) till 1947 (Independence). Average Indian was not wealthy prior to British rule. But average Indian became even poorer during British rule compared to any period in the past. After British left, India struggled for few decades but later Income per capita started rising again and created a 300 million strong middle class. Few relevant data points - The annual revenue of Emperor Akbar's treasury in 1600 was \u00a317.5 million (in contrast to the entire treasury of Great Britain two hundred years later in 1800, which totaled \u00a316 million).The gross domestic product of Mughal India in 1600 was estimated at about 21.3% the world economy, the second largest in the world.During the period, 1780\u20131860, India changed from being an exporter of processed goods for which it received payment in bullion, to being an exporter of raw materials and a buyer of manufactured goodsBritish economist, Angus Maddison argues that India's share of the world income went from 27% in 1700 (compared to Europe's share of 23%) to 3% in 1950Period before British rule - Lower income on per capita basis - For centuries preceding British rule, India was primarily an agrarian society. Even though its GDP share of global economy was high, the GDP per capita would have been much lower which is the case till date for India and China. Note that India has also held a significant portion of world population for last 2,000 years, thereby keeping the GDP and Income per capita lower.Income disparity - Then there was huge disparity of income with kings and minority elites amassing all the wealth by virtue of taxes and control of resources and export (spices, sugar, jewels, gems, cotton) revenue. The glorious forts, palaces, and tombs constructed by kings to glorify themselves, their families, dynasties are proof of concentration of wealth in few hands. In modern day, the -stan countries in Central Asia have similar dictators who have built luxurious palaces while general populace is poor. For instance the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1900s was the richest man on earth.Period of Gupta empire (100 - 400 AD) - Historians call it the Golden Age of India where many advances were made in Astronomy, Science, Mathematics, Literature. Vatsyayana wrote Kama Sutra. I haven't searched for economic data in that period but sounds like things were going well.Why Indians became even poorer during British rule? Of course, the exploitative nature of the rule was primary reason. Robert Clive had returned to England after winning Battle of Plassey for East India Company and was the wealthiest man in England. Other officers who returned home with the loot were constructing flashy, opulent homes in England and locals derided them by calling them Nabobs. Britain was funding its fight in World Wars by further exploiting Indian colony. Famine of Bengal was a direct outcome that lead to mass starvation and ~ 3 million deaths. Though not all Indians were worse off. The upper class Hindus were able to latch on to British education quickly and got jobs in massive railway projects, government jobs, civil service. Parsi community also caught the eyes of British and benefited. ",

            "answer_text": "If we are talking about it in absolute terms, common Indians were not wealthy. Until the 20th century, the common people in most of the world had a wretched existence. Even at the heights of Pax Brittanica in the late 19th century after Industrial revolution and colonization of the world, an English commoner had a fairly miserable life. Thus, if we are talking about the lives of common Indians [or commoner anywhere] in the 17th century and before, it may not be good.  If we don't talk in 21st century terms then things get a bit more complex. In relative terms - relative to the rest of the world standards of the time - things were better for Indians at various points of time. There was sufficient food production as the continually growing population would indicate.  In time periods such as the Indus Valley Civilization, it was possible that the lives of commoners were even better than common Indians of the present as seen from the ruins of well built cities with a large number of homes. The IVC citizens likely had better city planning, roads, sanitation, proper houses than most Indians of the 21st century.  In other times, there was probably not as good city life. However, in basic measures of wealth - fertile lands, cattle, access to fresh water, textiles and precious stuff such as gold, diamonds and precious stones, Indians had a better deal than most of the world during a lot of periods. There were fewer bloody revolutions and major wars than rest of the world and possibly few of other major extinction periods. See more on my answer here: Why are countries like India and China so densely populated? What are the circumstances and reasons? Again, remember that wealth could mean a variety of things. The commoners two centuries ago had a few things behind us - healthcare, food, transportation - but in a few other things access to land for food & play, cleaner water, leisure they could have been ahead of us.   The state was quite stable & prosperous in major periods such as the Maurya, Gupta, Chola and portion of the Mughal dynasty. However, if we talk about the period just before the colonization it was not good. It was a period of falling productivity, increasing instability. However, even that was better than the time under company rule. The rule under the crown [after 1857] was relatively better for the common Indians than the company rule. ",
