            "answer_text": "Not very in and of itself I\u2019m afraid. First off, archaeology is not about history its about culture and how culture evolves, or rather doesn\u2019t in many cases. What objects and how we use them can tell us about how people related to each other and their environment. For any historical value the results of archaeology must be combined and cross referenced across disciplines. This is because of statistical limitations. You assume any archaeological sample includes approximatley 5 percent of the material that was originally there. Only a percentage of that percentage is reliably \u201cin situ\u201d that is stayed where it was dropped or laid so many years ago, and the sample as a whole is rarely anything but discards, and so diagnostic value unless taken as a body of objects is limited. You take the results of archaeology and overlay them with palentology, bioarchaeology, biology, geology, history, art criticism, and folklore and you can start to see what occured historically, but as with now, the bulk of people that made up any given culture at any given point in time are voiceless as individuals, but that goes into the metaphysics of archaeo and beyond this post.

            "answer_text": "History is the past that is documented by printed language. Archaeology is a technique for recovering cultural information. So to use archaeology for a historic site is a little redundant. But still archaeological methods can recover information that history may not have documented.For example construction techniques and/or building materials and their sources may not have been historically documented - but that is information that archaeologists would routinely collect.
