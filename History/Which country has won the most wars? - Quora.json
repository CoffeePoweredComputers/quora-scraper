            "answer_text": " The military history of France encompasses an immense panorama of conflicts and struggles extending for more than 2,000 years across areas including modern France, Europe, and a variety of regions throughout the world. According to historian Niall Ferguson: \"of the 125 major European wars fought since 1495, the French have participated in 50 \u2013 more than Austria (47) and England (43). Out of 168 battles fought since 387 BC, they have won 109, lost 49 and drawn 10\", making France the most successful military power in European history\u2014in terms of number of fought and won.  The first major recorded wars in the territory of modern-day France itself revolved around the Gallo-Roman conflict that predominated from 60 BC to 50 BC. The Romans eventually emerged victorious through the campaigns of Julius Caesar. After the decline of the Roman Empire, a Germanic tribe known as the Franks took control of Gaul by defeating competing tribes. The \"land of Francia\", from which France gets its name, had high points of expansion under kings Clovis I and Charlemagne, who established the nucleus of the future French state. In the Middle Ages, rivalries with England prompted major conflicts such as the Norman Conquest and the Hundred Years' War.  The assault and conquest of Coevorden on December 30, 1672 by the troops under the command of General Rabenhaupt. Infantry and cavalry move in the direction of the ramparts around the fortified city With an increasingly centralized monarchy, the first standing army since Roman times, and the use of artillery, France expelled the English from its territory and came out of the Middle Ages as the most powerful nation in Europe, only to lose that status to the Holy Roman Empire and Spain following defeat in the Italian Wars. The Wars of Religion crippled France in the late 16th century, but a major victory over Spain in the Thirty Years' War made France the most powerful nation on the continent once more.  The topography, manipulated, is adapted to the desire to show together the main places of this tragedy. On the left is the church of the convent of the Grands-Augustins (now extinct) where the tocsin sounded, which triggered the killings, the Seine and the Meuniers bridge. In the center in the background, the Louvre and, in front of the building, Catherine de Medici the black widow, the main instigator of the massacres. In the center in the background, the mansion in which Admiral Coligny, leader of the Protestant party, is killed before being defenestrated, decapitated and emasculated. Gathered around his corpse, the leaders of the Catholic party, the dukes of Guise and Aumale and the knight of Angouleme. On the right in the background, the Porte Saint-Honor\u00e9 and, on the hill of La Villette, the gibbet of Montfaucon, where the body of the admiral will be hanged by the feet. Gathering more than 150 figures, the work is a true catalog of cruelty in times of civil war. Pregnant woman disemboweled (on the right of the painting in the background), children dragging an infant at the end of a rope (in the background in the center, to the right of the Meuniers bridge), woman skewered on a spit of a roaster (just behind the children trailing the infant), corpses bare and piled up (especially at the feet of Catherine de Medici), houses looted (behind the Catholic leaders). King Charles IX fired at his arquebus on his own subjects from a window in the Louvre (probably from the left tower of the building). This painting is quite exceptional because of the quality of its execution, but also because the contemporary representations of the massacres of St. Bartholomew are very rare. It bears the signature of the painter Fran\u00e7ois Dubois, Protestant Amiens refugee in Geneva after the massacres. In parallel, France developed its first colonial empire in Asia, Africa, and in the Americas. Under Louis XIV France achieved military supremacy over its rivals, but escalating conflicts against increasingly powerful enemy coalitions checked French ambitions and left the kingdom bankrupt at the opening of the 18th century.  Resurgent French armies secured victories in dynastic conflicts against the Spanish, Polish, and Austrian crowns. At the same time, France was fending off attacks on its colonies. As the 18th century advanced, global competition with Great Britain led to the Seven Years' War, where France lost its North American holdings.  Consolation came in the form of dominance in Europe and the American Revolutionary War, where extensive French aid in the form of money and arms, and the direct participation of its army and navy led to America's independence. Internal political upheaval eventually led to 23 years of nearly continuous conflict in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. France reached the zenith of its power during this period, dominating the European continent in an unprecedented fashion under Napoleon Bonaparte.  By 1815, however, it had been restored to the same borders it controlled before the Revolution. The rest of the 19th century witnessed the growth of the Second French colonial empire as well as French interventions in Belgium, Spain, and Mexico. Other major wars were fought against Russia in the Crimea, Austria in Italy, and Prussia within France itself.   France was always a colonial power, from Louis XIV. But his dominions were wearing out and he lost both his colonies in America as much as his possessions in Africa, and in that way and for that reason he tried to recover his imperial brilliance by allying himself with Great Britain to war against Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1914 .  But - I would say - that the purely French predominance in the world was ended there. The first European civil war had France as a protagonist and was fought largely in its territory. But the Allies did not have a clear victory over the central powers and the result of the First World War would be a Pyrrhic victory.  In other hand there're authors sayin that Poland is in the top ten countries to have won the most battles in history, ahead of even the Roman Empire. But is indisputable that the United States has been at peace for only 16 of its 242 years as a nation. Counting wars, military attacks and military occupations, there have actually only been five years of peace in US history \u2014 1976, the last year of the Gerald Ford administration and 1977-80, the entirety of Carter\u2019s presidency.  During his regular Sunday school lesson at Maranatha Baptist Church in his hometown of Plains, Georgia, former president of U.S. Jimmy Carter referred to the US as \u201cthe most warlike nation in the history of the world,\u201d a result, he said, of the US forcing other countries to \u201cadopt our American principles.\u201d While there is a prevalent belief in the United States that the country almost always wages war for noble purposes and in defense of freedom, global public opinion and facts paint a very different picture. Most countries surveyed in a 2013 WIN/Gallup poll identified the United States as the greatest threat to world peace, and a 2017 Pew Research poll found that a record number of people in 30 surveyed nations viewed US power and influence as a \u201cmajor threat.\u201d  The US has also invaded or bombed dozens of countries and supported nearly every single right wing dictatorship in the world since the end of World War II. It has overthrown or attempted to overthrow dozens of foreign governments since 1949 and has actively sought to crush nearly every single people\u2019s liberation movement over that same period. It has also meddled in scores of elections, in countries that are allies and adversaries alike. Nonetheless, researchers claim the UK is the 'second most powerful country' in the world behind the United States - and could even win in war against China and Russia. It has been named the world's only global power with the US named as the only super power by European Geostrategy. The study will surprise many, with countries usually considered world giants, like China and Russia, only being given the label 'regional powers'.  They were joined by nations such as France, India and Germany. European Geostrategy Magazine said being a global power meant the UK was: \u201cA country lacking the heft or comprehensive attributes of a superpower, but still with a wide international footprint and [military] means to reach most geopolitical theatres, particularly the Middle East, South-East Asia, East Asia, Africa and South America.\u201d The UK's military was 'comprehensive, advanced and diverse' and a major participant in NATO and other coalition operations.  Meanwhile, Britain continues to hold overseas defence bases at Ascension Island, Belize, Brunei, Canada, Diego Garcia, the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Kenya, Bahrain and Cyprus. Alongside that, the UK still maintains nuclear weapons and its defence budget ranks fifth or sixth in the world.  British Colonies nowadays In briefing paper in 2011, Professor Malcolm Chalmers, director of UK Defence Policy Studies at the Royal United Services Institute said: \"The UK will never again be a member of the select club of global superpowers. \"Indeed it has not been one for decades. But currently planned levels of defence spending should be enough for it to maintain its position as one of the world\u2019s five second-rank military powers (with only the US in the first rank), as well as being (with France) one of NATO-Europe\u2019s two leading military powers. \"Its edge \u2013 not least its qualitative edge \u2013 in relation to rising Asian powers seems set to erode, but will remain significant well into the 2020\u2019s, and possibly beyond.\u201d Britain is also understood to score highly in the Chinese \u00abComprehensive National Power\u00bb ranking system.  CNP measures hard and soft - cultural - power as well as economic and military clout. However the system is flawed as it does not take into account the fact that while China, for example, has a larger military force than the UK, it does not have the 'logistical capability to deploy, support and sustain those forces overseas in large numbers', wrote the UK Defence Journal . It added that the UK has greater capability than China - which is focusing its defences more locally at present - for operating at range. Our world is experiencing an upsurge in tensions in the Middle East and the difficult financial situation increases the chances of war aggressions. What then are the most likely armed conflicts?  Site of the 31 May 2017 explosion in Kabul, Photo courtesy: Washington Post The Russian site \u0420\u0411\u041a \u2013 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438, together with military experts and political scientists, identified the foci of seven possible wars in the near future. One of the key problems of international politics, which, according to experts, is about to trigger the outbreak of large-scale military operations is related to Iran's nuclear program. The head of the Military Forecasting Center of Russia, Anatoli Tsyganok, believes that a military solution to Iran's nuclear problem \"by the Americans, the Israelis or their joint effort\" is the most likely scenario for the near future.  The reactor building at the Bushehr nuclear plant is seen 750 miles south of the capital Tehran, Iran. (AP) However, according to some experts, a supposed \"conspiracy\" of the Islamic Republic is only a pretext for the outbreak of the conflict. \u201cMain reason for unleashing a war against Iran is to liquidate the center of the consolidation of the Islamic world, which represents Iran. And the center is strictly anti-Western, which under certain conditions could consolidate around Islamic countries\u201d,said the doctor of military science, Konstantin Sivkov.  Arak nuclear reactor in Northern Iran The Middle East looks more and more like a barrel of gunpowder that can explode at any moment. \"It is difficult to predict what and where ... The level of preparation for this process is very high, so from the African Atlantic ~Mauritania and Morocco~ to the borders of the Indian subcontinent, everything can happen in the next couple of years,\" he said. the head of the Middle East Institute, Evgueni Satanovski. First real conflict may occur because of Syria, where riots began in line with the \"Arab Spring\". Experts indicate EE UU It will not interfere in the Syrian conflict. However, he does not rule out aid to the Syrian opposition in the form of money and arms.  The consolidation of China's economic and political positions also appears as one of the possible scenarios for future military operations. The rapid development of China creates many problems for the country, both demographic and economic and ecological. Experts do not point out that the most likely war is between the United States and China, if the plan of the economic war designed by the Trump team fails. Is possible, but not problable. Another ancient source of tension is the Korean Peninsula, where since the Second World War there has been a confrontation between the two countries, with different ideologies, which has all the possibilities to enter a phase of armed conflict.  Although they tried to sit at the negotiating table, the relationship between them can not be described as good neighborliness. An important argument in the Korean conflict is the nuclear weapons possessed by North Korea. Experts predict a disturbing future in the territory of the former Soviet Union. At the center of the tensions stands a long-standing issue: the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan of Nagorno-Karabakh.  In addition, the current relations between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan cause concerns in the light of the laying of border mines, problems of transit of goods and the controversy surrounding the Rogunskaya hydroelectric plant.   Also according to experts, in the near future, African countries will keep the hottest spots on the world map. The main cause of major conflicts on the continent will be the rebellion of Tuaregs. It is a nomadic tribe that for years has been fighting for its own State, many rebels have served in elite units of the martyred Muammar Gaddafi. Another cause of serious conflict will be the fight for uranium deposits belonging to the French and Chinese and taken by the Tuaregs.  Among the main sources of tension are Libya, Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia but it is ruled out that an uprising could erupt \"anywhere and at any time\". Finally, the term \"third world war\" has not been in the field of \"fiction\", experts say. In this sense, they emphasize that the conflict could be originated by the global financial crisis and will face coalitions formed on the basis of countries' preferences about the world order: a model of domination of developed countries and a model of a multipolar world. The first coalition, according to experts, will be led by NATO under the auspices of the United States, the second has not yet been established. However, the doctor of military science K. Sivkov believes that \"as a prototype of such a union could serve the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) or the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO)\".  Experts pointed the third world war will become a platform for exposing new types of weapons that have not been used or have been banned, including weapons of mass destruction. If it is unleashed, it will affect a large proportion of the world's population, covering almost all continents, oceans and seas. \u201cFinally, the period between 6 and 7 to 25 and 30 years could be covered. More than 100 million people from both sides can participate in hostilities. The total demographic loss of the world population could be more than several hundred million people\u201d, was predicted.  Personally, I think that another world war, as classically considered, is an impossible prediction. Since the subversive ideology was imposed and the enemy no longer uses uniform or means of identification, the wars of the world will be against terror. And we must update the war doctrine to give adequate legality to the novel procedures that the military instrument of each affected nation will need to get rid of that murky network that will infect the national security of the countries.  Iraqi troops put up a poster of wanted insurgents The future strategic objectives ~instead~ will be for the domain of drinking water sources, food and non-renewable natural resources.  And everyone will know where bell the cat.

            "answer_text": "Japan claims it was founded 660 BCE and a Chinese Chronicle attests that Japan did exist in the 3rd century CE. Thus Japan is quite old, and thus has known and survived a lot of wars. Other countries with similar ages would be Ethiopia and Egypt. And of course, China could also be considered one of those oldest countries. Now, it is difficult to determine how many wars all these countries have fought but it is clear that Japan and China have been hostile towards one another for millennia. And Japan has been an aggressor towards many other Asian countries. But others also have tried to invade Japan itself and Japan also had many internal conflicts. Thing is, both Japan and China have been specializing in warfare. The Japanese had a special Warrior Caste and the Chinese Sun Tzu wrote \u2018The Art of War\u2019 to educate soldiers and commanders. Both countries had well-organized armies for at least two millennia, fighting against any foreign invaders while invading other countries themselves. However, Japan was never conquered while the Mongol hordes defeated the Chinese Empire and took over control. So China was basically \u2018reborn\u2019 from it\u2019s ashes and thus Japan would be considered much older than China. And thus have had the most wars, which they won. (And lost.) Even while they lost the final battles in WWII, Japan still exists as an Empire, just as it did a long, long time ago. As the Japanese Emperor has an unbroken bloodline going back 2,600 years, you can thus say that the Japanese Empire won the most Wars, else it would not have existed anymore. ",
