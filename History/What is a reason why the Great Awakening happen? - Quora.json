We know from John 6 and Romans 9, that God is sovereign in the salvation of sinners. John 1:13 says we are born into God's family not by the will of men, but of God.

In Romans 10:17, it concludes that faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the proclaimed word of Christ. In God's sovereign plan for saving sinners, He has chosen to impart saving faith to those He chooses, through the preaching of the gospel.
