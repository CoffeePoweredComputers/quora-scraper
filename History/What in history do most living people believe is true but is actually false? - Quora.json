            "answer_text": "One big one was that Napoleon was short. He was about 5'4 in French inches, which were bigger than English inches, making him about 5'7. That was actually quite tall for his time. One thing that always got a laugh from me and my church friends was that history books would claim that Joseph Smith (Founder and first President of the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints or 'Mormons') was killed for running for president.  Every account of his or the people around him around the time he was murdered says that he was killed for his religious standings. Another is that the Puritans left because they were being persecuted in England. When in actuality their beef was that England was becoming too excepting and not persecuting other religions enough. They left to be free to practice and persecute in peace. Vikings didn't wear horns in their helmets, ever. I actually am really curiouse where that came from. My two biggest pet peeves are Edison and Columbus. I don't believe in hating people, but they make me come pretty close. Thomas Edison did not invent the light bulb! He did not! People had been working on electric lighting for decades before he was even born. Then you're going to say that he made it in its current form. Well he didn't! Nikola Tesla invented the incandescent light bulb as we know it, and Edison stole it and made tiny adjustments to it before patenting it. He didn't invent most of his things. He had a think tank and was good at patenting their inventions. Also, Christopher Columbus. He was straight up evil. He was not the first white man in the Americas, Vikings (sans horns) had been coming for centuries. When he did arrive, he went about killing and enslaving Native Americans. He had a system set up where each Native was to bring him gold each month, or have their hands cut off. He also devised a new form of currency, girls 8-12. A despicable human with no place in histories good books. ",

            "answer_text": "That is an extremely broad question, but I will provide one item in answer to it: Historical Assumption: The Japanese surrendered in WW2 because of the destruction of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki wrought by the atomic bombs of the United States. Historical Fact: These bombings had virtually no bearing on the Japanese decision to surrender. On July 17, 1945, the Japanese government received reports that the cities of Oita, Hiratsuka, Numazu and Kuwana had been destroyed by American bombing raids overnight; on July 20, three more cities were destroyed; on July 27, another 3 cities destroyed; July 29, 6 cities wiped out; August 2, four cities gone, and August 5, yet another 4 cities obliterated... in the context of having civilian cities getting wiped off the map at that rate, the impact of August 6 and just 1 city being attacked (Hiroshima) would be and was negligible... the fact that it was destroyed by a single bomb instead of hundreds of bombs was entirely immaterial, the result would be the same.  Eight of the cities attacked with conventional weapons in the 2 1/2 weeks leading up to the attack on Hiroshima suffered more complete destruction than was suffered by Hiroshima, which in turn, suffered more destruction than Nagasaki. A former Foreign Minister of Japan, Shidehara Kijuro, a moderate, at the time opined that \"the people would gradually get used to being bombed daily. In time their unity and resolve would grow stronger.\"  On August 13, 1945, General Anami said that the atomic bombings were no more manacing than the fire bombings Japan had endured for months. So, what drove the Japanese to offer unconditional surrender?   The Soviets launched a devastating surprise attack on Japanese forces in Manchuria and the southern half of Sakhalin Island, annihilating the bulk of Japan's remaining military forces, and the Soviet 16th Army, 100 000 strong, stood poised to invade Hokkaido within 2 weeks.  The Japanese 5th Area Army was tasked with defending it, but had only 2 divisions and 2 brigades, which were stationed on the eastern side of the island (to attempt to repel an American invasion), outnumbered and out of position to do anything against a Soviet invasion from the west. Up until that point, the Japanese were counting on one of two strategies.  The first, a last-ditch defense that they knew would fail but might make an American invasion a pyrrhic victory, pressuring the Americans to accept more favorable terms of surrender.  The second, to utilize their pact of neutrality with the Soviets, allowing the Japanese to ask them to act as a diplomatic channel to sue for peace with the Americans.  The invasion of Manchuria by the Soviets meant the second option was no longer available, and the impending invasion of Hokkaido made the first option militarily impossible. (As an aside, this pressured the Americans to accelerate the use of their atomic weapons, because a Soviet invasion of Hokkaido would have proved the claim that an invasion of the Japanese mainland would result in the death of (initially) thousands of GIs to be a lie - the number of GIs the bombs \"saved\" grew over the course of the next 12 years, and was an assessment that was made by political propagandists which differed sharply from the professional opinions of America's generals.)
