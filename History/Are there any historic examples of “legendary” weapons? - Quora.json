            "answer_text": "Absolutely. One of the most legendary rifles that was ever devised was the 1874 Sharps. In fact, the 1874 Sharps is so prolific that several companies still reproduce them today, with the best of the best, those made by Shiloh Rifle, costing $5,000 and more. So legendary that even as a young kid watching the westerns with my grandfather, I knew I had to have one. What made the rifle so legendary was its accuracy. During a time when \u201cprecision rifles\u201d were shooting to 1,000 yards and hitting \u201cbullseyes\u201d that measured 36\u2033 in diameter (the size of the Creedmoor targets in 1875), Sharps rifles were one of the absolute dominating forces, capable of delivering repeatable bullseyes at those ranges. And the rifles chambered in buffalo cartridges, like the \u201cBig Fifty\u201d Sharps, could make kill shots out to those ranges. On June 27th, 1874, Native Americans surrounded the fort of Adobe Walls. William \u201cBilly\u201d Dixon, a buffalo hunter that was staying at the fort, went down to the armory, traded out his .45 caliber Sharps for a Big Fifty Sharps, and proceeded to fire at the attackers. On his third shot, he hit the man beside the chief and killed him. The Native Americans promptly ended the siege. With three shots from a rifle with only iron sights, and no spotter, he hit and killed a man at a range eventually surveyed to 1,538 Yards (1,406 Meters). There isn\u2019t another rifle in existence at that point that would have made that shot. Period. It took 93 years for someone to finally top that shot as the longest range confirmed sniper kill, and that was Carlos Hathcock\u2019s M2 Browning Machinegun shot in 1967. To this day, that old 1874 Sharps STILL holds the #14 longest kill position, despite the ungodly advances in long range firearms technology. When looking at just a list of the firearms that hold the top longest range kills, it\u2019s STILL #9. Imagine that: a 145 year old american made black powder rifle, originally designed for killing large game like buffalo, is STILL hanging in there with the new big dogs designed specifically for long range. To quote Alan Rickman from Quigley Down Under: \u201cAh, the legendary Sharps!\u201d  Edit: To add to the topic, I was just at a gun show in Virginia yesterday. The NRA had a booth there, and they brought THE Shiloh Sharps that Tom Selleck used in Quigley down under! Was a true honor to see, and just as beautiful is I imagined.  Edit #2: I have been asked for more pictures of my Sharps, so here it is!     ",

            "answer_text": "I say the Thompson Sub-machine gun.  Thompson Sub-machine gun Because, believe It or not, this gun is so powerful, It can't be wielded by an ordinary person.  Thompson fired Why? Because the Thompson was way too fast for an ordinary person.  Firstly, some context. The Thompson was created during WW1, where It was meant to serve as an alternative to the MP18, another sub-machine gun.  WW1  MP18 Now, the MP18 had a rate of fire between 350\u2013500rpm[1].  MP18 fired I want you to remember that number. Got It? Moving on.  The Thompson was not finished until after the war, with the first version being the M1919.  M1919 I want you to guess how fast the M1919 can fire. Remember, the MP18 did 350\u2013500 rpm. So, take a moment and think carefully  If you guessed roughly the same as the MP18, you'll be wrong. Because the M1919 actually fired at 1500rpm[2]. For context, this is how 1500rpm sounds like.  1500rpm Now, imagine that coming out of a gun no larger than your regular AR.  Thompson machine guns and ARs This made the Thompson an untamable beast, a gun so fast, that no man can hope to fire a full magazine out of this thing, let alone put down accurate shots.  The Thompson's spirit animal And just like any untamable beast, the Thompson would not be so easily brought under dominion.  The first attempt at slowing down the Thompson was to provide a compensator, which was offered with the M1921[3].  M1921  M1921 with compenstor But just like any bad pokemon move, It wasn't very effective, as the thompson was still at 800rpm[4]. Next, there was the replacement of the bolt and spring with those which were heavier and stiffer, respectively, bringing down the firing rate to 600 rpm[5]in the M1928.  M1928 But the fact that the Thompson had a stock with a rapid drop and a heavy trigger pull negated this, as the gun would still climb up considerably fast in full-auto.  Thompson stock. Note the rapid drop  M1928 fired. Note the muzzle climb This made the Thompson one of the only guns where engineers try to restrict the gun's potential, instead of the other way round. However, one of these attempts to control was pretty forward thinking of Its time. And that was the introduction of a fire selector in the M1928A1  Thompson machine gire selector  M1928A1 Now, fire selectors aren't new at that time, having been used in the M1918 BAR[6].  M1918 BAR  M1918 BAR fire selector But the Thompson was the first non-rifle firearm to use a fire selector, which proved that the fire selector could be applied to other guns too. So, in a way, the Thompson is responsible for the wide adoption of the fire selector. All of these made the Thompson legendary in Its own right.  However, a gun's fame goes well beyond Its technical aspects. The Thompson was a favourite of the american gangster, with Its high capacity and firing rate making It the perfect weapon to gun down rivals, such as the St Valentine's day massacare.  A gangster with a Thompson Sub-machine gun  The guns of the St Valentine's day massacare. Note the Thompson machine guns. It became so iconic, that Thompsons are still seen as a symbol of the mafia, long after the Thompson became a footnote in the history books.  A random Google image search of the word 'mafia'. Note the Thompson held by the right guy. Of course, this meant that the Thompson made It into gangster movies, such as the more recent Public Enemies (2009)  Public Enemies Thompson machine gun  However, this is not the end of the Thompson's fame. The Thompson was also used by the military as well, where It became a favourite of the US military.  A Thompson machine gun used by a soldier This made the Thompson an icon of the american soldier at war, which is why It shows up in movies like Saving Private Ryan (1998).  Saving Private Ryan Thompson machine gun Add all of these up and you got yourself a historical firearm whose legend knows no boundaries. After all, just walk around and ask anyone about the 'Tommy gun' and you bound to get 100% of responses mimicking the Thompson's shape, while pretending to pray and spray  The average recollection of the Thompson by a normal person That's all folks!

These blades could be produced in a day or two by a single person but were usually mass-produced to outfit entire Roman legions. Combined with a pilum and shield, your result was this:  These men formed the backbone of one of the most powerful empires of its time: The Roman Empire. Their men, armed with those weapons, marched in Britain, Africa, Palestine, Greece, the Balkans, Spain, Italy, France, and Germany, and swept away any who stood against them. These weapons are legendary. See this?  Or this?  These were the original guns. These could send mini spears flying hundreds of yards to end in a nasty, bloody death by exsanguination or ensuing infection (the Middle Ages wasn\u2019t known for its wonderful doctors). And, these weapons (especially the crossbow) could be put in the hands of peasants who barely knew how to hold a spear and shield properly, and still be used to smash through the armored shells of the previously near-invincible knights. This weapon is legendary. See this?  This puppy was used to smash castles to pieces or send big rocks hundreds of feet into the air over invincible walls. Ludgar the Warwolf, the King of Trebuchets, was observed to throw three hundred pound boulders with great precision and knock down sections of castle wall. This weapon is legendary. See this?  Or this?  These are the (so far) ultimate killing weapons. In America, just about everyone has a gun and a good many know how to use one. A gun can be small enough to hide in a pocket or it can be big enough to level buildings (artillery). A gun can kill a mouse or a brown bear or force a city to surrender. A gun can kill close up, far, far away, can fire fast as a thought or slow and accurately, they are easy to learn to use, and they can cause untold damage. Every modern nation with military power has guns as the main weapon. The gun is a legendary weapon. Finally, we have what everyone was waiting for:   The ultimate world-killer. The hydrogen bomb. This monster ravages cities in seconds. The blast is bright enough to burn someone\u2019s eye sockets out merely from looking at the blast. The fireball can vaporize a human into a mere shadow. The shockwave blows buildings away. Only two nuclear bombs have ever been used in war: Fat Man and Little Boy at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and they used uranium. The cities were burned to a crisp and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths to the Japanese. During the Cold War and even today, there were worries that a nuclear war would destroy the surface of the Earth. That is the most legendary weapon I can think of. Scientia potentia est. Shay ",

            "answer_text": "I'm gonna assume you mean individual named weapons from folklore and history. Here's a few: Excalibur - the sword of King Arthur as gifted to him by the Lady of the Lake. Caliburn - ostensibly the sword Arthur pulled from the stone and the predecessor to Excalibur, though possibly just another name for Excalibur. Rhongomaint - Arthur's spear. Clarent - another sword of King Arthur, later stolen by his bastard son Mordred and used by Mordred to mortally wound Arthur. Prydwyn - Arthur's shield, and also his boat. Tyrfing - a cursed sword from Norse mythology that would eventually kill its wielder. Hrunting - the sword of Beowulf as gifted to him by Unferth and used to slay Grendel's mother. Dyrnwyn - sword of Rhydderch Hael from Welsh mythology that burned with magical flame and would help or punish the man who drew it according to his intentions. Kusenagi - sword from Japanese myth. Thunderbolt - the weapon of Zeus. Nandaka - the sword of Vishnu. Gram - the sword of Sigurd from Norse mythology. Mjolnir - the hammer of Thor. Gungnir - the spear of Odin. Hrotti - a sword from the hoard of the dragon Fafnir, claimed by Sigurd after the slaying of the beast. Skofnung - the sword of the Danish king Hr\u00f3lf Kraki. Durendal - unbreakable sword of Roland. Cortana - sword of Olgier the Dane. Joyeuse - sword of Charlemagne. Balmung - sword of Siegfried. Sword of Mars - sword of Attila the Hun. Legbiter - sword of Magnus Barelegs. Zulfiqar - unique double-bladed sword of Ali, the son-in-law of the prophet Muhammad. Sword of Mercy - a broken sword and part of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom. The Wallace Sword - a claymore purported to have belonged to William Wallace. Sword of Stalingrad - a longsword presented to Joseph Stalin in 1943 to commemorate the Soviet defenders of the Siege of Stalingrad. That's about all I can think of. There's undoubtedly many more legendary weapons, historical and mythical. And if I had to guess, they're probably all swords. ",

            "answer_text": "Archimedes, a famed polymath, architect, engineer, and genius, has had many legends surrounding him throughout history. Some, like his laser death ray with mirrors, have been proven false. But others have some truth to them. Like the massive crane-claw thing that his city used to capsize enemy ships.  This weapon was apparently very effective against invaders by sea. Archimedes\u2019s city of Syracuse managed to repel several waves of Roman naval assault with some of the claw cranes. The Romans were pretty shocked when they saw their ships being plucked out of the water; they were kind of lousy engineers at first, so they could never dream of seeing such a contraption in action. Some of the enemy ships came close in-shore, too close for the artillery to touch them; and these he dealt with by using a swing-beam and grapnel. The method was this: the swing-beam projected over the wall and an iron grapnel was attached to it on a heavy chain; the grapnel was lowered on to a vessel's bows, and the beam was then swung up, the other arm being brought to the ground by the shifting of a leaden weight; the result was to stand the ship, so to speak, on her tail, bows in air. Then the whole contraption was suddenly let go, and the ship, falling smash as it were from the wall into the water (to the great alarm of the crew), was more or less swamped even if it happened to come down on an even keel. \u2014Livy, The War with Hannibal Modern reenactors have created models of Archimedes\u2019s crane contraptions and have proven that they would have worked given the technological and material constraints of the time. While we don\u2019t have physical artifacts, we do know that if anyone could have created these marvels of engineering, it would have been Archimedes. It\u2019s pretty epic to imagine giant ass cranes powered by nothing but weights and levers smashing through ships. In a world without gunpowder and truly effective long-range weaponry, that would have been terrifying.  ",

Picture of a Fusil d'infanterie Mle 1777 or French Model 1777 Infantry Musket (Charleville) [3] The general design of a Charleville musket was very simple: a .69 caliber smoothbore musket barrel with the length of approximately 1.52 metres (60 in) and the flintlock firing mechanism. It weights around 4.50-4.75 kilograms and the effective firing range should be around 100 yards. Although the firing range of the Charleville musket was very limited, but it had its own presence in almost wars in Europe and North America during the XVIII and XIX centuries.   American revolutionaries during the War of Independence. The Charleville muskets Model 1763 and Model 1766 were intensively used by the American revolutionaries during the War of Independence (1775\u20131783), against the British\u2019s Brown Bess muskets. Thanks to the aid of Marquis de Lafayette, around 25,000 Charleville muskets were smuggled and supplied to the hands of Continental Army\u2019s fighters [4].   French revolutionary soldiers at the Battle of Jemmapes, with Charleville muskets on their hands (November 1792) With Charleville muskets on their hands, the French revolutionaries and patriots defiantly fought back the counter-revolutionaries and foreign invaders of all kinds, then subsequently safeguarded the Premi\u00e8re R\u00e9publique as well as the libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9 - three core values of the famous French Revolution [5].   Napoleon reviewing the Imperial Guard (armed with Charleville muskets) at Jena (1806). A Drawing of Horace Vernet in 1836. Throughout the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, the Charleville musket Model 1777 was indeed the typical infantry weapon for French soldiers. Moreover, The Charleville muskets also followed the footsteps of the victorious Napoleon\u2019s Grande Arm\u00e9e to Austerlitz (1805), Jena-Auerstedt (1806) and Friedland (1807).   The French woman from this famous painting \u201cLiberty Leading the People\u201d (La Libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple) was holding a Charleville musket Model 1816. This painting is indeed a masterpiece of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix commemorating the July Revolution of 1830. The Charleville muskets were again on the hand of French revolutionaries during the July Revolution (r\u00e9volution de Juillet) in 1830. Later on, the Charleville muskets continued to have its own presence during the Lyon Revolt (1831), the Paris Uprising of 1832 (which was the main theme of Victor Hugo\u2019s Les Mis\u00e9rables) and finally the French Revolution of 1848. Afterwards, the French Army systematically changed their infantry weapons, and the Charleville muskets only saw limited use in several conflicts until the 1850s.   A group of Vietnamese Royal Guards and regular troops in 1830, in which two of them (The Royal Guards) were armed with Charleville muskets. There is one interesting thing that not many people may know: During the end of the XVIII and at the beginning of the XIX century, Vietnam or the Empire of \u0110\u1ea1i Nam was among the very first countries in Asia who had its troops equipped with Charleville muskets (especially the Model 1777 or Saint-\u00c9tienne musket).  A Vietnamese soldier (soldat Cochinchinois) of Vietnam in the year of 1843, armed with a Charleville musket Model 1777 (Saint-\u00c9tienne) and bayonet. In 1788, at the midst of the war between T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Dynasty and Nguy\u1ec5n Lords (1787\u20131802), the first batch of 1,000 Charleville muskets were delivered to Lord Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh (who later won the war and became the first Emperor of Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty) by the French warship Dryade during its trip to the island of Poulo Condor [6]. From 1802 to 1874, the Charleville muskets were indeed the primary infantry weapons of Royal Guards and some artillery regiments of Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty. In Vietnamese, they called it as \u201cTh\u1ea1ch c\u01a1 \u0111i\u1ec3u th\u01b0\u01a1ng\u201d (\"\u77f3\u673a\u9ce5\u67aa\"), in which \u201cTh\u1ea1ch c\u01a1\u201d (\"\u77f3\u673a\u201d) means for flintlock mechanism and \u201c\u0111i\u1ec3u th\u01b0\u01a1ng\u201d (\u201c\u9ce5\u67aa\u201d) means for the musket. During the French conquest of Cochinchina or Southern Vietnam (1858\u20131862), there were at least 2,000 Saint-\u00c9tienne muskets were discovered by French troops after the occupation of K\u1ef3 H\u00f2a Fortification Line (February 1861) [7].

With nearly eight million were produced during the XVIII and XIX centuries, in my opinion, the Charleville musket should be a good candidate in the list of \u201clegendary\u201d weapons of all time. Hope my answer above will satisfy your curiosity about what is the historic example of a \u201clegendary\u201d weapon.

Now this is a strange topic, for despite being a popular trope in fiction, I can't think of any weapon that can be called legendary in the last 200 years. You have legendary ships of course, but that doesn't seem to fit the question. Well for one you have the William Wallace sword currently residing in Stoke castle (we still have not forgiven you for the travesty of a movie that was braveheart), I think a few of the swords of the Spanish saints in the reconquista are still around, and Napoleon's descendents have recently done an interview where they say that whenever they want a new villa they merely take one of the many swords of the wall to auction.

It can pierce bullet stops while being fired standing up with virtually no recoil. It can fire any regular round so long as the round has been magnetized in addition to plasma shells that blow up on impact. I call this historic because it\u2019s likely to replace regular weapons once battery tech is good enough. Three times the range, many times the velocity, adjustable power levels, more versatility, and much less noise than a regular rifle. The one reason why this thing isn\u2019t deployed in the army is capacity. It\u2019s capacitor bank needs to charge after each shot and there\u2019s no battery capable of delivering that amount of power multiple times. One day, though, this thing will undoubtedly become the weapon of choice for the Army. ",
