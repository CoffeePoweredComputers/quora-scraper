            "answer_text": "I'm quite surprised you asked \"when\" instead of \"if\", since \"when\" implies certainty of that event occurring. It seems that all these years of secrecy have done little to hide the growing military power of the People's Republic. Joking aside, it depends on what type of weaponry you are comparing. Because Russia has a lot of weapons inherited from the USSR that are not cost-effective for the People's Republic to repeat/reproduce. For example, they will never match the nuclear arsenal of the Russians because it's too expensive and the prospect of an all-out nuclear war is very unlikely. Another example is the Russians have much better/more non-stealth long-range bombers from the cold-war era. It would be stupid for the People's Republic to develop a similar bomber.  In some other more contemporarily relevant areas, however, the People's Republic have already caught up with if not surpassed the Russians. For example, DF-ZF, a delivery vehicle maneuverable at Mach 10, is progressing as well as if not better than the Russian Yu-71 program. The Chinese stealth fighter jet program has outpaced the Russian T-50 in production and the People's Republic will likely to have a larger fleet of 5-gen stealth fighter jets. The PLAN is also modernizing at a speed unparalleled by Russia.  So I guess the answer is, military power is not a well-defined term and should be broken down to different types of operations and weapon systems when we do the comparison. In some areas the People's Republic is obviously lacking and possibly will be for a long time, but in some other they have caught up or surpassed the Russians.  ",

            "answer_text": "The balance of power between the neighbors is not as relevant as one might assume. They both have large nuclear arsenals. They did have a border fight in 1969. There can be no doubt that Chinese military power is in the ascendency, while Russia has yet to bottom out from the collapse of the USSR. So, as time progresses the differences in capability will grow. It's difficult to see an all-out was between two nuclear armed states. The real threat is not power, it's people. Illegal Chinese migration to Siberia has been going on for decades, and at a time in the future, the majority of people in Siberia will be of Chinese origin. This is a method of expanding state boundaries that will become of greater importance as populations grow, and decline, while borders do not change. ",
