            "answer_text": "I think it depends on the individuals involved. Perdonaply, I was born and raised in Italy until the age of 21, when I moved to the UK, then to the US. I have plenty of Albanian friends and they are some of the funniest, most compassionate and close friends I have. I'm very much a believer that overgeneralizing isn't the best way to make friends and, if anything, it's a fool proof way to make enemies. I know Italian people I don't like spending time with -or downright dislike- and sure, there are some Albanians I know and don't care to pursue a relationship of any kind with them. Just as being Italian doesn't guarantee I'll have chemistry with a person (friendship-wise), being Albanian only means that the specific individual was born in another country, and how our interactions are going to be aren't dictated by the passport they have. I firmly believe that, while people are fundamentally good, and no matter where they go or come from, most of them hope to fit in, make friends, be treated well and with respect regardless of country of origin. There are exception to this, but there are just that, exceptions. That\u2019s my personal stsbcs re: Albanians in Italy. However, let's face it, Italian politicians (and I'm not going to make this a political post, I'm simply reporting the facts) across the board and, on occasion, the press, have done their fair share to portray Albanians as undesirable outlaws that take advantage of the \u201csystem\u201d (what system is not very clea). There have been occurrences when Albanjans have been involved in criminal activities of various degrees of seriousness (but so have been Italians for that matter, it just doesn't make the news as much). There are italians that are scared, angry and mistrusting of Albanians and other minorities and some of them refuse to change their mind even when presented with the overwhelming evidence in favor of Albanians as a whole social group. That's sad and disheartening but I believe it is an accurate glimpse of the interactions between italians and Albanians: mostly positiv, with the odd instance of tension and friction. ",

There are strong cultural connections between the two countries. first of all there are 800.000 albanian immigrants in Italy, and 250.000 arbereshe a community that lives in Southern Italy since senturies, while the population of Albania is 3.000.000 and there are 20.000 italians there. During the Hoxha\u2019s regime people used to illegaly watch RAI the italian state television, and this continued also after the fall of the regime, making Italy the Americn dream of albanians, also because of this 70% of the albanian population can speak italian. Albanian exports go to Italy for the 40% and also it imports a lot from italy. italy is the principal aid and foreign investor. Italian law enforcement and the albanian one strongly cooperate to counter organized crime and there are a lot of other examples. also kosovo albanians see italians as friends because of the nato-led intevention in Kosovo against Serbia.

On the other hand, there are many ethnic Albanian enclaves in some areas of Southern Italy; when the Turks invaded Albania and Greece in the late Middle Ages, many fled to Italy to maintain their identity and not be \u201cassimilated\u201d into Turkish culture. Last, during the communist regime of Enver Hoxha, anyone who could afford a television would aim their antennas towards Italy - so many along the coast would speak Italian as they learned it on television. But national identity is another matter and Albanians are proudly Albanians. So Yes, Albanians like Italians, but they are not \u201clike Italians\u201d ",
