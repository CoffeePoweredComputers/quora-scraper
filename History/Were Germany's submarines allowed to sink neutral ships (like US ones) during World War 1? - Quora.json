Neutral ships are required to stop for inspection to ensure they are not carrying war materials. If the Neutral ship does not stop it can fired on. It is virtually impossible to stop and inspect ships with Subs if the other sides navy is out hunting them, so the Germans sank any ship they thought was carrying war cargo to the allies. ",

            "answer_text": "No. There is an international treaty relating to this that the German\u2019s obeyed too. Neutral shipping was allowed. However, there was always a blockade on enemy countries, and any ship that approached an enemy country was subject to a stop and search. Those found violating the blockade would be sunk, and the maritime rules of the day allowed seamen to leave in lifeboats. However, sometimes mistakes were made, such as the sinking of the Lusitania and neutral US ships. Things really changed in February 1917, when Germany announced unrestricted submarine warfare. It did this as part of a larger strategy to knock England out of the war. However, the plan didn\u2019t work. Here\u2019s a good link for you: Unrestricted submarine warfare - Wikipedia ",
