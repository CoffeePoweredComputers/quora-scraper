            "answer_text": "Is your question was it tasty, or was it nutritious and wholesome? Certainly, if we are to believe diaries and letters, people often found food to taste good. Maybe they enjoyed foods more than we do, who are so used to added sugar and flavorings. Some of them also worked hard and, as the saying goes, \u201chunger is the best sauce.\u201d There were also people (even professional cooks) who \u201ccouldn\u2019t boil water.\u201d Cooks were dismissed because they burned the steaks or oatmeal, or their coffee was muddy and disgusting. (Cooks in the US often had a lot of power, though, and sometimes employers put up with a lot.) At times there was limited food available, too, especially for the poor and during the winter. Good housekeepers made chow-chow and other relishes not only to show off their skills, but to help prevent people from being bored with the same foods served every day. (Cabbage rolls, boiled cabbage, cabbage soup, ham hocks and cabbage\u2026you get the picture.) Was the food nutritious and wholesome? We\u2019d probably say NO in many cases. There were a lot of additives and adulteration practiced in 19th century food: plaster of Paris in bread, watered down milk, poisonous dyes in candy and pickles. (There\u2019s a book about this on Gutenberg, if you\u2019re interested.) Contaminated water was a problem. You might draw your water from a stream that was polluted from the upriver factory\u2026.or the local pig-lot. My grandfather got typhoid after drinking from a stream that he said was the most beautiful and clear stream you could imagine. Contaminated water also carried cholera. Milk and meat could also be contaminated. Cows, goats, or pigs with brucellosis could pass this illness through their milk or meat. Pigs could also pass trichinosis through undercooked pork. Less likely, but possible, poor people eating raccoons could also contract Baylisascaris procyonis, a roundworm that can be VERY dangerous to humans. (I had to look up the word for it.) Lack of refrigeration was a serious problem. Milk curdled. Butter and cream sometimes went rancid. Apples and potatoes rotted. Meat was a major problem; some rural families didn\u2019t get fresh meat except at butchering-time or from a game-animal. Most meat had to be salted, put in brine, potted (like an early form of canning), or pickled. These methods didn\u2019t always work. Women complained that their smoked hams had \u201cskippers\u201d (small flies) or other bugs in them. Potting meat, without modern pressure cookers and jars, was potentially dangerous. Salt meat would keep if well done, but the meat might have to be soaked to remove some salt before cooking. Fish could be dried safely in some areas, but not all. There were no food and drug purity laws (in the US) yet, so it was anything-goes as far as factories and processing plants. If you really need details, read The Jungle about the packing industry in the early 1900s. Just don\u2019t read it before you have sausages or hot dogs for supper. I hope this didn\u2019t scare you too badly. I believe that many people in the past had stronger digestive/immune systems than we have today. Of course, many people died of food poisoning or unknown illnesses that were probably food-related. In short, if we ever had a zombie apocalypse and modern civilization crumbled, whether the zombies or the food would end more of us is anyone\u2019s guess. ",

            "answer_text": "Food was homegrown and cooked from scratch in the 1800\u2019s. There was no fast food or chemical-laden junk food and processed food. Think about it: Milk and butter fresh from the cow; vegetables straight out of the garden; fruit from the orchard, not from a warehouse; fish fresh from the stream; poultry, beef, pork, lamb, or chickens raised on your own property And you ask if food was good back then? In all honesty, it was probably a lot better, on the average, than what most people eat now. It was almost certainly more healthful than the commercially grown, warehouse-stored stuff we find in the grocery stores now days. Of course, city people would have purchased a lot of their food, but it was probably better quality than it is now. Chickens, for instance, were killed on the spot versus weeks or months earlier. People carried them home, removed the feathers, cut them up, and cooked them. They didn\u2019t get shoved in the freezer for a week or two. Cold storage might have been a problem, but there were ice chests and other methods. One of them was to place fresh cuts of meat in a large ceramic crock and cover it entirely with cooled melted fat. It didn\u2019t need refrigeration because the fat kept the air away from the meat, thereby preventing it from spoiling. Of course, people still had desserts and sweets back then, albeit it was all homemade. Too much of that kind of thing caused health issues in the 1800\u2019s just as much as it does now. ",
