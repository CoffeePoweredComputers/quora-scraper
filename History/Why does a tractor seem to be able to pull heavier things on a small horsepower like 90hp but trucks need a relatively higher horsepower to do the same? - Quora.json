            "answer_text": " This gasoline powered tractor was built in 1968. (Sept 24 to be exact) The 4 cylinder is 4.2 liters, red lines at just 2350 RPM, and is rated at 60 hp. As she sits in that photo, the rear tires are filled with a strong salt brine that adds nearly 1000 lbs to each wheel. This brings the machine to nearly 9000 lbs. She is shorter than a Mini Cooper, almost as wide as a Hummer, and stands over 8.5\u2032 tall. Top speed in 8th gear is about 16mph. You don\u2019t shift up to reach that, you let the clutch out slowly in the gear you want - yea, if you screw this up, you can get whiplash. But most of my work is done in the first 4 gears. Max speeds from 1.5mph to just under 5mph. Sounds weak and slow? Barely more than twice the horsepower of a modern riding mower. Except that as long as those massive rear wheels with the aggressive tread has traction, she will keep pulling. I have a grading attachment that I hang on the 3-point rear hitch. The grader is 1000 lbs and the tractor has no problem picking it up. Looks like this:  The width is 84\u2033 (over 7\u2032). The teeth break up hard packed gravel, soil etc. Then the two blades dig up and redistribute to level out the ground. My 300 hp car can\u2019t drag it on a pallet, just sat there spinning its wheels. But the tractor can not only drag this, but can do so with gravel up to the crossbar, nearly 20\u2033 deep. It isn\u2019t horsepower that moves, but torque. At 1.5 mph, that massive tire only needs to turn 498 times in one hour (332 rotations to the mile). That\u2019s just 8.3 times per minute. The engine is spinning at 2100 RPM (standard speed for proper PTO operation) so, the transmission is slowing down that rotation a lot. 253 times to be exact. Torque is a simple calculation. 60 hp = (Torque * 2100 RPM) / 5252 Solving for torque we get 150 ft lbs. Now, remember the rear wheel turning slow? Well, we get to multiply the 150 by 253 to get the torque of the rear wheel. We are talking roughly 38,000 ft lbs. (it\u2019s not exact, there is some loss, but for our needs, this is close enough) This isn\u2019t the power to the ground as we need to divide the radius of the rear wheel (roughly 2.5 ft) so only a measly 15,000 lbs of force is being delivered to the ground. And that my friends is why my specific machine can easily pull the massive load of the grader and the gravel with ease. Of course, if the tires were to lose traction, it would not be able to make use of that power. With nearly 6000 lbs on the rear tires, the lugs tend to dig in quite well. What the engine lacks in torque, the gearing makes up. We lose speed in the process, because the engine doesn't put out much power. But we're not in a hurry. For comparison, the engines in a semi make between 1,200 and 2,050 ft lbs of torque, but their transmissions are designed for the road, so it can\u2019t put nearly as much as a farm tractor to the ground. But, a Farm Tractor can\u2019t pull an 80,000 lb load at 70mph. ",

            "answer_text": "As stated by others here, tractors have a lower gearing that allows them to pull heavy loads - but only slowly, which for the environment they are working in is enough and sometimes even a must.I have a nice story that happened to a friend of mine a while ago. In Europe, new tractors commonly run 50 kph (and a bit), some 60 and even 80 kph.So, because tractors are cheaper than semis, you are seeing a lot of tractors here doing on-site work in road construction, which is often done with dump trucks elsewhere. As long as they don\u2019t have to cover long distances, they are doing fine. My friend was driving tractors on the side for a contractor and about 15 years ago they had just gotten this new 50 kph tractor (around 150 hp) and the contractor, wanting to turn this \u201c50kph feature\u201d into money, took a job of hauling heavy stuff over a distance of app. 90 km. His calculation went: \u201cTractor runs 50 - so a bit over 2 hours and the job is done. The tractor costs only half the money of a semi but is much more versatile. I am going to make some extra cash hauling\u201d.Well, reality and not thinking it through hit quickly:When after 2.5 hours my friend was still nowhere in sight he called: \u201cWhere the hell are you? Isn\u2019t that thing supposed to run 50?\u201d. \u201cYes, boss - on the straight, but not uphill with this load. I am doing 10 kph uphill here. In the end, I still not even have half the power of a semi!\u201dSo actually the labor costs went through the roof (and the expense on AG tires was horrible, too). ",
