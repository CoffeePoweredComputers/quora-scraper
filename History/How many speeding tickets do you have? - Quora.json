            "answer_text": "Technically, 0. Well I got one when I was younger but it got bumped down when I challenged it. I\u2019ve been pulled over 4 times in my 12 years of driving, all in New York / New Jersey. I live in Colorado now and have learned that the cops are much less likely to pull over an Audi than they are a Subaru. My car I used in New York, for all 4 times I\u2019ve been pulled over, is a 2004 Acura RSX Type S. Bright blue. Pitch black windows. Somewhat noisy. Got pulled over by an unmarked car on the first date with a girl I would then date for 11+ years. It was embarrassing and they potentially illegally searched my car. I wrote about it here.Got pulled over on the highway for doing approx. 86 mph in a 55. In my (half) defense, the cop set his speed trap right at a point in the highway where the speed limit dipped from 65 to 55. He bumped it down a few mph on the ticket so as to not get me on reckless driving. I was pretty upset because there were many other cars going much quicker than me, but perhaps that\u2019s why I was pulled over. I was easier to catch. Anyway I plead not guilty and got it knocked down to something like rolling through a stop sign. 1 or 2 points on my license instead of many many more. Definitely got lucky here.I supposedly ran a yellow light in jersey (NY plates get you in trouble when you go really south) and was in the intersection when it went red, so I got pulled over. The officer asked me what I was doing down so far in Jersey and I explained that I had a hockey game. He laughed and asked me which rink, what division, and who I was playing that night. He then said I was playing against his brother and that I should kick his ass, and he let me go.I passed a really evil speed trap coming out of jersey and into NY. Around a blind corner, in the rain, there was an officer backed into some trees and bushes with all his lights off. I\u2019m not gonna pretend to know the law but I\u2019ll speak about what I thought the law was, and if it\u2019s true it\u2019s true if it\u2019s not it\u2019s not, but I believed it at the time. If an officer is setting a speed trap like that, their lights must be on. That is what I thought, so I thought this was a pretty malicious speed trap\u2026more like hunting than doing any protecting. So I flash my headlights at a car coming the opposite way to warn him. Shortly after that, flashing lights and I\u2019m pulled over. The officer asked me what I was flashing my lights for and I mentioned how concerned I was about a lot of downed branches from the storm we had just gotten, so I was warning the other driver! He ran my information and came back and said he\u2019ll buy the story for now but that it\u2019s illegal in NY and NJ to flash your lights to warn about speed traps. I don\u2019t know how true that is either, but he let me go (and if he wanted to be a jerk he could have gotten me for the window tints).All in all I\u2019ve been very lucky with my police interactions.",

            "answer_text": "Well, luckily for me, speeding tickets that are on a person\u2019s record expire after a certain amount of time. If it weren\u2019t for that, I\u2019d have quite a few. Shortly after moving to the state of Washington recently, I was pulled over for driving 65 in a 55 mph zone. I had just driven off one of the ferries plying Puget Sound, and was heading home, a trip of about an hour and a half. Seeing the lights behind me was bad enough. Things were about to get worse. He asked for my driver\u2019s license, registration, and proof of insurance. I immediately gave him my license, and started looking for my proof of insurance and registration. Yikes! I couldn\u2019t find my registration or my insurance certificate. I did find the wallet card of my insurer, and offered him that. I told the officer that I was a little disorganized because I had recently bought the car from my brother-in-law, and had just moved to Washington state. The officer said, \u201cWell, welcome to Washington.\u201d Some people might have taken that as a snarky remark, as in \u201cWelcome to our strict Washington traffic laws.\u201d But I took it completely at face value, and said, \u201cWell, thank you!\u201d As I was replying, the officer cracked a little smile, as if enjoying the irony of welcoming me to the state at the same time as stopping me for speeding. He asked me if I was a commuter from my new hometown. Aghast, I said, \u201cDo people really commute that far?\u201d He said, \u201cOh, yeah, lots of people do.\u201d I said \u201cI can imagine it would be pretty irritating having so many drivers tearing through your town just trying to catch the ferry or head home for the evening.\u201d No response from the officer. The officer went back to his patrol car for a bit, and I said I would keep looking for the registration. After a few minutes, the officer approached the car again. I still had not found the registration, and was thinking I was in for a whopping fine. The officer said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about finding the registration right now. I\u2019m just going to give you a warning.\u201d Whoa! I guess the two of us had a moment there. Thanks Officer! So, at the moment, I have no speeding tickets on my record. ",
