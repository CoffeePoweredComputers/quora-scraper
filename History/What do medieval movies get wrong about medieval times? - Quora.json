            "answer_text": "Really long LOONG one on one sword fighting. If one of them was a skilled knight, with two or three movements the other one is dead.AFAIK the use of archers was seen as non-chivalrous until the English made heavy use of them with his longbows. Anyway, doesn\u00b4t matter the time, you see a lot of archers firing arrows. Specially fire-arrows, which unless you are trying to set on fire enemy\u00b4s siege equipment or a building, doesn\u00b4t hat any particular effect on infantry.Real life sieges takes weeks, months or even years. Usually ending with some sort of agreement. But in movies: \u201ctoday we lay siege, tomorrow we storm the castle\u201d.., a massive attack against big walls with archers\u2026is a \u201c\u00a1no way man!\u201d. Too many casualties, you couln\u00b4t fight in the next battle or defend the castle afterwards.Every battle is so definitive, both armies usually fight until everyone is killed. In real life, didn\u00b4t happen, both armies approach each other in some sort of formation, fight a little, step back\u2026again and again until someone starts running, then others starts running as well and finally the line/formation is broken. The peasants run and the enemy cavalry chase them\u2026I have the impression, when you read medieval texts or quotes, that they put god in every phrase they say. Is like everything they experiment in the real world , they saw it through a \u201creligious lens\u201d. In movies, many many times, the dialogues are modern or laconic spartan like\u2026The king has absolute power, mmm..no. He can\u00b4t do whatever he wanna do, his power relies in his lords, his has to deal with them (also the church)\u2026more GOT like.In movies a simple poor peasant can just ride a horse like a bicycle, or the use of horses in farms. Let me explain, horses were expensive (they still are today), to buy and maintain. Only noblemen or rich merchants can afford them. Also, know how to \u201cuse\u201d a horse, requires some training. Then, the use of horses in farms to plow the fields wasn\u00b4t the norm, they make use of oxens , horses are better to plow because were easier to maneuver and resistent but it didn\u00b4t happen until S XIV or XIV if i recall correctly. Anyway, poor people will use oxens.Rare, but i saw it in some Russian movie\u2026peasants hunting deer in the forest to eat. Unless in medieval Russia were different, AFAIK hunting was a privilege for the noblemen, they get better access to meat. So, if you break that rule and hunt a deer in the king\u00b4s forest\u2026you will be probably executed.",

            "answer_text": "The fighting and battles. All too often I see knights taking their helmets off during a duel, which is the stupidest thing to do. I don\u2019t think I have to explain why protecting your head is important.Sieges are depicted incorrectly. Sieges took months and weeks, yet in movies they\u2019re always shown storming the fort or castle with trebuchets, siege towers, and such.You have a row of archers and the commander yells \u201cFire!\u201d Why? The correct term is \u201cKnock! Loose!\u201dEveryone who isn\u2019t a noble is depicted as covered in rags with shit and mud on their face. As Monty Python hilariously lampshaded, \u201cWho\u2019s that there?\u201d\u201cI dunno, he must be a king.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t got shit all over \u2018im.\u201dBasically the normal people would be relatively clean, and most common folk wore bright clothing.When showing a smith forging a sword they always show the iron being melted, then poured into an open cast. Suspiciously, the molten iron is very orange-y in color, looking almost like molten aluminum. Molten iron is white in color, so next time you see molten metal being poured into a cast that\u2019s not white hot, you know it\u2019s aluminum they\u2019re using. Not only that, but that makes cast iron, which you don\u2019t want for a blade as it\u2019s too brittle, you want to use carbon steel, which is hard, tough, and flexible. What they actually did was smelt iron ore to make steel, then work that lump of steel into a bar that\u2019s sword shaped, heat treat it, and ground it to shape. Forging metal into a sword doesn\u2019t look as spectacular as molten metal flowing slowly into a cast. Also, why are they always pouring so slowly? If you\u2019re going to cast anything, first of all, don\u2019t use HALF of a cast, secondly, when dealing with molten metal that cools down quickly, you wanna be quick but careful when pouring. The casting of swords was never done for iron or steel weapons, but was done for bronze, so that may be where the confusion lies with filmmakers.The stark white Post Reformation style cathedrals and churches. Back in those days, almost everyone was Catholic, and Catholic churches are a riot of color, with depictions of Biblical scenes, saints, and martyrs, as well as Jesus plastered all over the place.The depiction of arms well before they were ever introduced, like in Braveheart showing William Wallace wielding a rather large two handed sword years before longswords were even invented. Longswords, that is, a sword you use primarily with two hands, didn\u2019t start appearing until the Late Middle Ages. During the High Middle Ages, if someone had a sword, it was generally an arming sword, that is, a sword you use in one hand.The depiction of armor is horrifically bad. No evidence of gambesons (padded linen jackets), too much leather, and if they have mail, the mail coifs don\u2019t go up to the chin, which it was supposed to to protect your neck. Several anachronistic armors as well. I once saw a film that showed a great helm in a film set in the late 15th Century. By that time, helmets have long since evolved past the great helm.Not enough heraldry or tapestries or color in the castles of the nobles. Just look at the iconography of the Medieval times. Again, these people were Catholics and loved plastering their history, their religious beliefs, and their family crests damn near everywhere.In battle scenes, everyone breaks up into a series of duels instead of holding a formation.Lumping the Crusades into one anachronistic lump instead of the generation spanning series of conflicts they really were.And finally, the worst offender. Movies depicting armor as useless, rather than being the substantial protection it was, which gave a HUGE significant advantage to the wearer, without sacrificing their mobility much.There\u2019s loads more, but these are my biggest pet peeves. EDIT: Updated it to include blacksmiths forging weapons. ",
