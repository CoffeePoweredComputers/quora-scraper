            "answer_text": "In generally, anthropology is the subject of studying human beings, and it\u2019s divided into four fields. Those are cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology, archeology, and physical anthropology. Through these four fields, the main purpose of the anthropology is to comprehensively study and understand human nature, human mutation, the human origin that based on scientific grounds. In detail, the anthropologist is trying to \u2460clarify the physical structure of human beings from the past to the present, \u2461study the surrounding environment that the main components of making their physical structure and \u2462study the human\u2019s intellectual change seen from the cultural aspect, and \u2463from linguistic aspect. Why we have to study anthropology, and why the study as an anthropology is very important for all academic things are because all academic are studied by humans, and if we don\u2019t understand the essence of human beings, we can\u2019t understand even the other essences of academic studies. In the current, while jobs or some activities are performed by AI and artificial intelligence on behalf of human, there are still many fields that human beings still have to do, and how much humans can demonstrate their abilities and get the successful results to depend on how humans understand themselves. Therefore, by studying anthropology, we can review and understand the human being from many aspects, and humans can succeed in many fields and scenes. Anthropology is the basic and important study of all things. That is why human beings can succeed in various situations by reviewing and understanding humans from various aspects. Anthropology is an important academic subject to all things. ",

            "answer_text": "Anthropology is the study of humanity and everything to do with humanity \u2013 throughout time and across all cultures and ethnicities.  The subject material is so broad it is generally divided up into several sub-fields:  archaeology, cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and physical or biological anthropology (each of which has an applied component, making a fifth sub-field).  1.              Archaeology is the study of human artifacts \u2013 anything created by humans from ancient temples to yesterday\u2019s garbage. Archaeology is closely allied with history, as you might guess. 2.              Cultural anthropology, as it is called in the United States, is the study of living human societies and cultures, and as we will be discussing, pretty much everything you do, from eating in your car to naming a child to brushing your teeth, is cultural in origin.  Cultural anthropologists often work with psychologists and sociologists, as well as economists, political scientists, and historians.3.              Linguistic anthropology is concerned with the development and relationships of language(s).  What we say is a map to how we view the world.  Linguistic anthropologists also often work with psychologists and sociologists.4.              Physical, or biological anthropology is the study of the human organism, throughout time and in various states. Paleo-anthropologists study the earliest humans and our other ancestors further back in time.  They often work with geologists, and paleo-botanists (what do you think paleo means?). Other biological anthropologists study everything from population genetics, to disease, to breastfeeding.  They collaborate with biologists and geneticists. Forensic anthropologists are often featured on shows like FBI Files \u2013 they work with the police and coroner\u2019s departments to determine who somebody is and how they died in cases of unknown corpses. Anthropologists conduct their work by using the scientific method, also known as the empirical method.  Can anyone give me a good description of the scientific method, perhaps from biology?  One way to put it is that it is a systematic approach for describing reality as experienced by a number of people.  It is the formulation of hypotheses, or scientific guesses, about a problem (like the origins of humans) followed by the testing of these hypotheses through experimentation (perhaps looking for fossils), observing phenomena (say a really strange-looking skull) and collecting data (a whole bunch of strange skulls from one cave).  Once this is done, the anthropologist puts forward a tentative explanation of the phenomenon (it is another species of human, Neanderthal), and ultimately works to develop a theory, an explanation supported by data.  Scientists publish their results so that they can be seen by other scientists, or peer-reviewed in journals.  This is to encourage other people to try and replicate their experiment and obtain the same results.  The shared belief in a theory by a number of scientists is called a paradigm. As you can see, anthropologists work with any number of people from other disciplines, and we draw upon the theories in these disciplines as well.  Because of this, research in anthropology is often inter-disciplinary.  Anthropologists often focus on problems that stretch across several disciplinary boundaries, because human behavior is rarely simply biological, or economic, or political in nature, rather it is often determined by a number of factors.  Because of this, anthropology is considered to be holistic \u2013 it is the study of a problem or question in human affairs within a whole context. Just like an archaeologist destroys a site when they dig it up, changing it forever; so a cultural anthropologist must work within a culture that is live and unforced.  This is similar to the Prime Directive on Star Trek, and just like Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock, we are always violating that rule!  Any system that is observed will change due to the act of observation \u2013 this is true in physics and it is true in anthropology.  Of course, a physicist can make those photons and neutrons run through the accelerator one more time, for anthropologists, there is no such luck.  For that reason, cultural anthropologists spend a great deal of time (a year or more) doing fieldwork, immersed in a culture.  Anthropologists must usually learn at least one language other than their native one in order to do this, and sometimes more.  Many times you must know a language of the scientific community, like Spanish or Japanese, and you must know a field language like Nahuatl or Chukchi.  The method used during fieldwork is called participant-observationand means just what it says \u2013 living and interacting with people doing all kinds of activities, and then writing up your observations in field-notes.  Anthropologists also rely on interviews with informants, generally people expert in some area of their culture, like a shaman or maybe a politician, or a farmer.  These informants help the anthropologist to access the emic, or internal understanding of the cultural system, sometimes called the worldview. Fieldwork done in one culture is usually conducted on one problem, or research question, that occurs all over the world, thus anthropology is comparative.  The product of all of this hard work is an ethnography, or a description of a culture.  The comparative aspect, the ethnography containing the data collected by the anthropologist, and the on-going scientific dialogue with peers is part of the etic, or external understanding of a culture \u2013 the outsider\u2019s viewpoint.  One book title that sums up the anthropologist\u2019s position nicely is The Professional Stranger by Michael Agar. Margaret Mead is probably STILL the best-known anthropologist of all times.  She did a lot of work on childhood and adolescence in numerous cultures throughout her career.  Her most famous book is called Coming of Age in Samoa. There she tested the psychological theory that adolescence is invariably an upsetting period, and found that in some cultures that wasn\u2019t true. This is called a negative example, and it is very important in the sciences.  Because anthropologists work comparatively and cross-culturally, the data we collect can often be used to prove or disprove theories and problems in other social sciences. ",
