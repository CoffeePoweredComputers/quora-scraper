            "answer_text": "Because a significant fraction comparable to one-half of Slovaks \u2013 and possibly much larger, depending on the question you would ask \u2013 wanted a higher degree of autonomy or visibility or straight independence. A major example of the minor hassle was the Hyphen War, see Lubo\u0161 Motl's answer to Has incorrect usage of punctuation ever caused a war or similar event? Lots of Slovaks have actually dreamed about such independence already from the 1840s which was the decade when Slovaks decided to be a separate nation within the Kingdom of Hungary \u2013 different from Czechs. Lots of Slovaks were also attracted to the Slovak State in 1939\u20131945 although it was a clerofascist satellite of Nazi Germany. In the early 1990s, after the Velvet Revolution made them more free to express their views, many of the Slovaks fought for this change of the status of their nation and they complained often. And Czechs \u2013 who were OK with the arrangement of the nations and wanted to focus on economic and other reforms \u2013 behaved similarly to the other typical \u201csenior nations\u201d in conglomerate countries up to early 1992 or so \u2013 almost like Spaniards who dehumanize or criminalize all Catalans who consider themselves a different nation, but we were not as bad as the Spaniards. However, sometimes in early 1992, a phase transition took place in Czechia. \u201cWe must save Czechoslovakia, it\u2019s so important\u201d has changed to \u201cLet them go\u201d as the dominant view and very quickly. After all, we mostly thought that Czechia was subsidizing Slovakia and there were other problems we would get rid of. Finally, a substantial number of \u201cCzech nationalists\u201d who were sort of mirror images of the Slovak ones emerged at that time. The divorce was basically sealed when right-wing pragmatic, rational Klaus\u2019 ODS won the Spring 1992 elections in Czechia, while left-wing, populist, and emotional Me\u010diar\u2019s HZDS won in Slovakia. These very different results showed that Czechs and Slovaks were thinking as two different nations, not one nation. Virtually all the parties were either purely Czech or purely Slovak in 1992 \u2013 Klaus\u2019 ODS that had 35 percent in Czechia and 5 percent in Slovakia was actually closest to a counterexample! Fortunately, the personal chemistry worked great between Klaus and Me\u010diar, they trusted each other, and they were also motivated by the vision of becoming the most important men in the two new smaller countries. They agreed Czechoslovakia had to split \u2013 weakening of president Havel (a foe they shared) was a pleasant cherry on a pie \u2013 and they negotiated enough to make sure that the dissolution of Czechoslovakia was basically free of any problem. The basic rules for the dissolution was simple. All immovable assets are divided according to locations, all movable assets and debts are divided in the 2-to-1 ratio (this nicely rounded ratio shows that there was simply enough generosity which was important), the number of extra exceptions was tiny, Czechia would become the de facto only successor in many international organizations that didn\u2019t allow to increase the number of members (e.g. sports leagues) while Slovakia would copy the basic laws and would be forced to work from scratch in ice-hockey and elsewhere. The U.N. allowed both new countries to be members just like Czechoslovakia before, of course. In February 1993, six weeks after the countries were independent, cash was speculatively moving from Slovak banks to Czech banks \u2013 assuming that the Slovakia-based Czechoslovak crowns were at risk of becoming the less valuable Slovak crowns at some point. This shortage of cash in Slovakia was a logistic or economic problem so the speculators\u2019 position became a self-fulfilling prophesy and the Czechoslovak currency really needed to be divided \u2013 the Czechoslovak banknotes were stamped over the weekend (by two different piles of stamps, Czech and Slovak ones) and this whole process was problem-free, too. It was great that they did it efficiently, within a few months, and they weren\u2019t trying to get rid of responsibility, e.g. by organizing a referendum that wouldn\u2019t solve anything. Such a referendum could end up as \u201cstay\u201d in Czechia and \u201cleave\u201d in Slovakia which would only increase the tensions \u2013 what such an asymmetric result would mean? Even if it were \u201cleave\u201d in both parts of Czechoslovakia, it wouldn\u2019t say how to do it \u2013 the Brexit difficulties show how bad it is when the politicians don\u2019t really believe what they\u2019re \u201cordered\u201d to do by a referendum. And if the result were \u201cstay\u201d in both parts, the demands to reform things and weaken the federal state wouldn\u2019t stop, either. Klaus and Me\u010diar took the responsibility and did it right. At that moment, the Slovak National Council lawmakers had already declared the formal independence of Slovakia, Havel had resigned on that day, and Czechs \u2013 while not celebrating \u2013 were just getting used to the inevitable, although they had no good reasons to celebrate it. Czechs and Slovaks have really gotten used to profound yet peaceful \u201cregime change\u201d. The dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918, exactly 100 years ago this Sunday when Czechoslovakia was created, was a velvet divorce, too. The annexation of the Sudetenland by the Nazi Germany in 1938 was another peaceful event, although a very frustrating one, and so was the March 1939 occupation of the remainder of the Czech lands accompanied with the formal Slovak independence. The massive 1968 Soviet-led occupation was a relatively peaceful yet far-reaching process, too, and the 1989 fall of communism was the famous Velvet Revolution. In many of these events, the status of the country changed dramatically and the people were rarely the main driving force. So we\u2019re used to it and the people behaved in a sensible, disciplined way during the Velvet Divorce. There are of course people who still say that Czechoslovakia should have been saved and Klaus and Me\u010diar were acting against the will of both nations. I actually talked to one of these \u201cSlovaks in Czechia\u201d during the most recent Klaus\u2019 birthday party in Prague. But Czechs and Slovaks are satisfied and especially Slovakia has clearly benefited from the new setup \u2013 its potential could have been unleashed more than in the federal country, it seems. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is my favourite \u2018theory' - one that hits uncomfortably close to credibility and warns us about possible future of EU. After the fall of comunism, it was a great chaos, full of opportunities to get rich - I mean crazy rich. But you needed to be connected to the new government or at least parliament. To get votes, it works to paint a picture of enemy and offer protection. So Czech politicians offered to \u2018protect\u2019 Czech interests from \u2018economic damages\u2019 of \u2018poor\u2019 and \u2018stupid\u2019 Slovaks, while Slovak politicians promised to \u2018protect\u2019 Slovaks from \u2018devastating\u2019 Czech efforts to \u2018conquer\u2019 Slovakia. New politicians were under extreme pressure to get corrupted by many people sensing opportunities, trying to bribe them. Politicians and their new friends from the organized crime decided it would be beneficial to split the territory. Then politicians escalated any issues between the nations instead of at least trying to come up with any solutions. Now comes the crazy outcome - territory divided and voters are happy, because they saved \u2018us' from \u2018them\u2019. It took six months from the elections to the celebrations of independence. ",
