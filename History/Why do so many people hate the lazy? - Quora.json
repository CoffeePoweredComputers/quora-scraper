            "answer_text": "Because the lazy hate themselves. They tend to be annoyingly and loudly disdainful of the productive to rationalize their laziness. For example, I have a lazy adult stepson. In his mid-20\u2019s, he threw a tantrum over reasonable demands (that he not bring home his lazy drug-addicted kleptomaniacal lost children friends to our house at all times of day and night; we changed the locks and that offended the hell out of him) and he said, that\u2019s it, I\u2019m moving out. Please, don\u2019t throw me in that brier patch\u2026 I gave him a couple of thousand dollars for first/last months rent/deposits and told him, until you pay me back for this, you will never again live in this house or get anymore money from me. Best money I ever spent. There\u2019s a $2000 hill for him to climb if he ever wants to borrow another penny from me. He\u2019s doing OK now, still too lazy, but being an adult, if not the adult I\u2019d hoped he\u2019d be. We have a huggy truce now. I respect his choices but am wary of what help he might suddenly expect. Were he to give that $2K back, he\u2019d be in a lot better position to extract help from me. Don\u2019t nobody tell him. Now, let\u2019s assume that you are lazy, but you are not being a pain in the ass to the person who hates you for being lazy. Screw them. Unless you are taking their money or otherwise being dependent on them, they don\u2019t get a vote on your life choices. There are a lot of ambitious people who have really shitty values. They treat waitresses badly. They feel contempt for everyone not as talented or driven as they are. Steve Jobs was one of them, all you Apple fanbois. Bill Gates too, though Melinda seems to have done a lot to tame and civilize him. As long as you are paying your own way in life, let no man shame you. If someone you depend on thinks you\u2019re lazy, stop depending, and then no man can shame you. ",

            "answer_text": "I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it. -Bill Gates Most people don't hate lazy people because most people are lazy people. Millennials have already been termed as the burnout, lazy and entitled generation suffering from something dubbed as \u2018errand paralysis\u2019. Errand Paralysis has been defined as the inability to cope with simple, boring tasks like paying bills, cleaning that one messy cabinet or mailing a letter due to mounting anxiety. A person who is lazy is more relaxed than a person who is constantly active and over performing. A lazy person knows that they don't need to stress over mundane tasks and that they'll find a way to complete their chores in their own sweet time and well within the timelines provided. Technology has also made us lazy. We depend upon gadgets to perform simple tasks like chopping up vegetables, wash our dishes, wake us up and choose a vehicle over walking 3 blocks. I'm pretty sure the television remote control was invented by an extremely lazy person who had it enough with walking down to the idiot box to change each channel! Imagine if we had to do it today! Channel surfing is the only kind of surfing I'm ever going to be capable of. We don't want to make efforts to remember things such as events, meetings or birthdays and prefer our smart devices to remind us of these dates without flinching a finger. There's an app for everything and our minds have started to shut out irrelevant things. Heck, there's even an app that reminds you to drink water! Nonetheless, I don't think most people hate lazy people, because we're all lazy in some way or another. Laziness comes in all shapes and sizes and we all tend to be lazy in doing something that doesn't interests us. ",
