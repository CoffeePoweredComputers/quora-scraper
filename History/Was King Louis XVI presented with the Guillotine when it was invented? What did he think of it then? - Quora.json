            "answer_text": "Louis XVI is said to have been presented with the design of guillotine and have introduced a number of improvements. If it is true, we can only say that, as a responsible person, he tested his mechanism himself. When we look for the portraits of Louis XVI, we see something like this:  But this guy did not always wear ermine mantles. And he did not take much pleasure in being a King. He would much prefer to be a locksmith. It was his passion since childhood. Here is what the Austrian ambassador said about him: Nothing can keep this young prince from his extraordinary penchant for the various blacksmithing, locksmithing and similar works. He is always busy reequipping something in his apartments, making locks, keys and other things. So, quite naturally, the King was interested in technology. The new technological solution was proposed at the start of the French Revolution. Under the ancien r\u00e9gime, French justice used a number of refined methods of capital punishment, including beheading with a sword, hanging, the breaking wheel, dismemberment by horses, burning at the stake; sometimes these were preceded by the use of molten lead and boiling oil. In 1789, Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, Deputy of the Estates-General, proposed to abolish all these old and beautiful customs and replace them with a capital punishment that would simply end life, minimising the suffering. Guillotin believed that the best solution is decapitation \u201cby means of simple mechanism\u201d. Such a device would ensure the equality of everyone under the law. It took time to convince others. Finally, in early 1792, the National Assembly voted to introduce the new method of capital punishment and the King signed the law. A committee was formed, chaired by Antoine Louis, surgeon and physician to the King. A number of ancient beheading mechanisms were examined. When Antoine Louis designed the device, he was invited to the Palace of Tuileries where he discussed it with the most high-ranking locksmith in the kingdom \u2014 Louis XVI. The King approved the design but introduced a number of improvements, most notably changing the shape of the blade from round to oblique.  Left: Joseph-Ignace Guillotin. Right: Antoine Louis Alas, this story exists only in M\u00e9moires de Sanson, a source published only in 1861 and reputed apocryphal. Too bad. In any case, the machine was designed. The prototype was made by Tobias Schmidt, a German engineer and harpsichord maker. At first, it was called louisette after Antoine Louis but finally, the name guillotine prevailed thanks to a popular mocking song. On 25 April 1792, the first execution by louisette (guillotine) took place. On 21 January 1793, Louis Capet, formerly King Louis XVI of the French, made personal acquaintance with the cutting-edge technology.  ",

            "answer_text": "There is a wonderful Merchant/Ivory movie called \u201cJefferson in Paris\u201d that takes place at the dawning of the French Revolution, when Thomas Jefferson was our ambassador to Paris. Nick Nolte plays Jefferson, who has left America and come to France and is in sympathy with the democratic changes brewing in France. He has brought his slaves with him, one of whom, Sally Hemmings, is his mistress, (who is hated by his bitch daughter played by Gwinneth Paltrow). In one amazing sequence a party of French aristocrats are sitting at a dinner table discussing the revolutionary changes favorably; one of the aristocrats has a miniature guillotine, a toy, and they praise the humanitarianism of this method of execution, giggling as they chop the heads off of asparagus. Oh, the irony. ",
