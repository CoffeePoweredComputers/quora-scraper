            "answer_text": "You know, the Cape Ann effort was precisely meant to obtain commercial success. It did not work. However, those who came over were quite effective. No one died abnormally until later when a slew of people started to arrive and overwhelmed resources. That is, one cannot export if one is starving. The Cape Ann crew did not experience this: Cape Ann, Retrospective. Once things were settled, then, yes, there was regular shipping back of fish. After all, Cape Cod was named for its abundance of fish which was the case up and down the coast. We\u2019re talking early colonial. A few years later, seafood was a major part of the total income of the economy. At a later point, whale oil was huge. Coming in were things like livestock. For a long while, people had to bring in the consumer goods. After all, even at Ben\u2019s time, he wore homespun with pride. There are tales of people having silk in the late 1600s. Ships? The first one was built by the Popham Colony back in 1607. Think of that. This thing sailed, even back to England. How was that? Remember, Popham is in Maine, and it was just a bunch of guys. Well, later, one finds shipbuilding all up and down the coast. Oh yes, rope. The colonial period went until 1776, so there would be a mixture. My interests, somewhat, are the earlier years as those people had the guts and ingenuity to start from scratch, essentially. The first house was put up in 1624 with materials brought from England: Great House (Cape Ann). Not only is the timeline important, we need to think of their technology, such as tools. Even then, we had the doers (able in all sorts of manners, like Thomas Gardner) and talkers (like the Reverends - except Rev. John Wise was also strong and a farmer). Brief answer to a complicated question. ",

            "answer_text": "Hardwoods, leading to de-forestation. Coffee, Tea, Spices. Sugar from the Indies. The funny thing was that 17th century women would blacken their teeth to make it look like the rot from eating Sugar, which was very rare and expensive. Funny how nobody really asks what people were doing before the Colonists turned up. The Industrial Revolution was as much a creator of wealth as the Colonies. Indian pundits on here bemoan the fact that india\u2019s gdp fell during the Colonial period, but the fall in India\u2019s share of the World Market was because the countries of Europe and the Americans were beginning to mass produce the items which were traditionally hand crafted in India. If you are unconvinced, please read Mark Twain\u2019s \u2018More tramps abroad\u2019. Then read \u2018The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists and maybe you will see that the poor of Britain were just as exploited as anyone else in the World. In Scotland, from 1602 to 1799,a version of slavery was practised on Colliers and Salters. Two High risk professions. An employee could not leave his master without that master\u2019s permission. If his wife and children were involved in his work, then, they too were bound to that master, for good or bad. There was a brief period of respite, from 1650 to 1659. The Interregnum. Britain was never a rose garden for the Poor. ",
