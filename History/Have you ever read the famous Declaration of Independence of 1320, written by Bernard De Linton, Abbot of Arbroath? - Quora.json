            "answer_text": "Yes, and I\u2019ve quoted from it many times. The Declaration of Arbroath was the first document in recorded history that affirmed that the prerogative of a government to govern the people is contingent on the consent of those being governed: To him (King Robert the Bruce), as to the man by whom salvation has been wrought unto our people, we are bound both by law and by his merits that our freedom may be still maintained, and by him, come what may, we mean to stand. Yet if he should give up what he has begun, and agree to make us or our kingdom subject to the King of England or the English, we should exert ourselves at once to drive him out as our enemy and a subverter of his own rights and ours, and make some other man who was well able to defend us our King\u2026 This was a revolutionary document, because it denied the doctrine of the \u201cDivine Right\u201d of Kings, the idea that monarchs were ordained by God to rule and that no man had a right to refuse submission to their rule. The Scottish nobles who signed the Declaration were stating that they chose Robert as King because he had delivered them from the English invaders\u2014and if he ever submitted to them, they would remove him and choose another. It was centuries before the \u201cDivine Right\u201d idea was challenged in another nation. But the concept took root in the British Isles, and it was part of the justification for another Declaration that was written 456 years later, and which also involved a people declaring themselves free of an English king: That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, \u2014 That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Again, this is a declaration affirming that the authority of a government comes from the consent of those being governed, and they have the right to change their government if it is failing in its duty. This is something that isn\u2019t taught in school, but it should be. The principles our Nation was founded on, and even their actual origins, are taught totally wrong. The Declaration of Arbroath is one of the greatest documents in the history of human freedom. Declaration of Arbroath 1320 ",

            "answer_text": " Yes. And anyone interested in the Declaration of Independence should read it as Jefferson used it as a model . Scotland may have been in a strong position at home, but it was weak abroad. It did not enjoy good relations with the papal power base, unlike England, which persuaded the Pope to excommunicate the whole of Scotland. (Bruce had already been excommunicated for his part in the murder of John Comyn in a church). Although Pope John XXII subsequently sent two cardinals to England in 1317 in an attempt to negotiate a truce, Edward II was stubborn and peace looked a dim prospect. In response to the papal intervention Robert the Bruce wrote two letters to the Pope. Accompanying these letters was the Declaration of Arbroath, a document drawn up by Scottish barons, clergy and other nobles, which formally set out Scotland\u2019s case for independence. It was drawn up at Arbroath Abbey (in now what is the local council of Angus) on 6 April, 1320, probably by the Abbot, Bernard de Linton \u2013 Chancellor of Scotland. The declaration explains Scotland\u2019s struggle to become an independent state, and tries to persuade the Pope of the legitimacy of Scotland's case. It also warns the Pope that unless he accepts the Scottish argument the war will continue, and any deaths would be his responsibility. To modern eyes the history is ludicrous, but what comes across even today is the sincerity of the men who wrote it: \"It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom \u2013 for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.\" The Declaration was sent to Pope John XXII in Avignon along with two letters from King Robert Bruce. It does not seem to have unduly influenced the Pope, although it could have persuaded him to intervene between the countries and prepare the way for the Treaty of Northampton in 1328, when the English finally relinquished their claim to Scotland. What makes the Declaration of Arbroath so different from anything that had gone before is that for the first time it sets the will and wishes of the people above the king. By doing so, it marks the first expression of the idea of a contractual monarchy, which became the prototype of contractual kingship in Europe. It also must surely be counted as one of the most eloquent expressions of nationhood ever written, promoting the right of freedom for all men and man\u2019s right to defend this freedom to the death. It is interesting that it records an idea of Scottish nationalism that rises above the feudal obligations that had characterised the country less than a quarter of a century before. It influenced the American Declaration of Independence (ratified on 4 July 1776), but was mostly forgotten in Scotland after the 17th century. It was only rediscovered popularly in the 19th century and is now used as a political tool by nationalists and quoted by proud Scots everywhere. https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle-2-15039/the-declaration-of-arbroath-1-465228 Classic language from the document states: \u201cAs long as but a hundred of us remain alive, never will we on any conditions be brought under English rule. It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours, that we are fighting, but for freedom - for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself\". It is believed Jefferson used this text as an inspiration for: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\"Declaration of Independence, 4 July 1776 ",

The author was in fact Bernard, Abbot of Kilwinning who was later Chancellor of Scotland and Abbot of Arbroath. Bernard de Linton was wrongly identified as being Bernard of Kilwinning for some time but that now been shown to be an error. ",

The test of any historical document, or event, is whether it was known to succeeding generations and had any impact on them.

I think Scotland is too small as an entity. If Scotland left the UK and rejoined the EU that would mean less Scottish independence.
