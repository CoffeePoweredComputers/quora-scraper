However, even after the opening of the Suez Canal and the introduction of steam ships, it still took many months to travel from the UK to India in the 1870s. There weren\u2019t enough coaling stations for early steamships, and passengers were forced to transit by rail on several points along the route. Rail travel wasn\u2019t well developed either, so travelers had to anticipate periods of delay along the route.
