            "answer_text": "Others have pointed out that France does not call its administrative subdivisions states. Another thing worth noting is that France\u2019s administrative subdivisions are not nearly as powerful as US states. France\u2019s departments and regions cannot make their own laws; all they can do is apply national laws and manage budgets. They do not have separate judicial systems; all courts are part of the national judicial system. ",
