            "answer_text": "The online article that addresses this question most directly appears to be Is the Jew White?: The Racial Place of the Southern Jew, an article published in the journal American Jewish History in 1997 by Leonard Rogoff, the research historian of the Jewish Heritage Foundation of North Carolina. The basic answer is that, before the civil rights era, Jews in South were in an ambiguous racial category that was neither fully \"colored\" nor \"white.\" In fact, Rogoff's article shows that, before the 1960s, the belief that Jews were a distinct racial category was not limited to the American South:  From at least the early 1800s and continuing into the 1960s, Jews were often distinguished from whites in common speech. This stereotyping prevailed among both blacks and whites regardless of region. In the American vernacular a \"white\" Jew might denote an honest businessman or a Jewish friend in contrast to a \"black\" Jew, who was not to be trusted. An R. G. Dun agent's credit report noted of one Indianapolis Jewish merchant: \"We should deem him safe but he is not a white man. He is a Jew.\" When Felix Frankfurter was nominated for the Supreme Court, Senator William Borah of Idaho received a protest letter that whites, not Jews, belonged on the Court. This language also prevailed in the Southern lexicon. In 1893 the Times of Richmond cited a police report on an altercation between a \"white man\" and a \"Polish Jew.\" The owner of a Georgia resort explained to his Jewish friend that as a \"white Jew\" he could swim in the lake, but other Jews were unwanted. Some white Protestants in Atlanta spoke of the Russians as \"black Jews.\" \"Everyone was black or white and then there were the Jews,\" Atlantan Nancy Thal recalled of the 1950s. As late as 1961 Dean John Buhler of the Emory University Dental College was still asking applicants to indicate whether their \"race\" was \"Caucasian, Jew, Other.\" Blacks, too, both North and South, spoke of Jews and whites. As defense lawyers in the Leo Frank trial pointed to a black suspect, a black newspaper in Chicago questioned, \"Is the Jew a white man?\" Black folklore included a genre of jokes about a \"Colored Man, a Jew, and a White Man.\"  On the other hand, after the defeat of the Nazi regime in 1945, a lot of the pseudo-scientific racial theorizing previously done by Southern segregationists (and Northern eugenicists as well) was heavily discredited, because of the strong family resemblances between American \"scientific racism\" and Nazi racial doctrine. Over time, this made it less socially acceptable to describe Jews as a racial category separate from white people, and these changes were already starting to affect the South by the early 1960s. As the 1960s wore on, the only major voices in the South who insisted on describing the Jews as \"colored\" were rabid segregationists on the fringe of politics, who were reacting to heavy involvement of Jews as allies in the black civil rights movement. According to Rogoff,  Archsegregationists characterized Jews as \"white niggers\" or as pure-bloods who were debilitating the white race by encouraging race mixing. J. B. Stoner and his National States' Rights Party (NSRP) of Georgia picked up the Anglo-Israelite theme. In his newspaper The Thunderbolt, Stoner railed against \"Jews and other mongrelizers\" and cited the science of Gobineau, Grant, and Stoddard. In Durham the populist weekly About Public Appeal carried Anglo-Israelite columns from Dayton: \"Jesus is against integration . . . . Only a small number of the dark, hooked-nose, kinky haired racially mixed Jews returned to Israel from Babylonian captivity. The most pure Semitic White Race is to be found today in the Anglo-Saxon.\" John Crommelin of Alabama, NSRP vice-presidential candidate in 1960, quoting Stoddard, thought that \"Jews picked up their first traces of Negro blood\" in Egypt. Crommelin described such a mix-blooded person as a \"Jewlatto.\" These themes survive among some members of the Christian Identity Movement that derives from Anglo-Israelitism. The Aryan Nations' creed states that \"the Canaanite Jew is the natural enemy of our Aryan (White) Race.\" Jews are \"children of darkness\" while Aryans are \"children of light.\" In Proof: God's Chosen are White Adamic Christians (1974), Thomas O'Brien of the New Christian Crusade Church of Metairie, Louisiana, writes that Jews \"are the mongrelized descendants of Satan through Cain.\" With such discreditable voices like these on the rise, Jews in the South and in the rest of the United States became much less likely to be described as a separate race. In addition, given the low rate of intermarriage in the Southern Jewish community at the time, it became harder for non-Jewish Southern whites to insist credibly that they were less ethnically heterogeneous (or \"mongrelized\" as the segregationists would have put it) than their Jewish counterparts.

            "answer_text": "Legally, Jews were not segregated in southern states as Blacks were. But there was always widespread anti Semitism. The worst case was that of Leo Frank, a Jewish factory manager who was lynched after being falsely accused of the murder of a teenage girl, Mary Phagan, who worked in the factory. The ones who murdered Frank were, seriously, Georgia state congressmen. His case led to almost a state wide pogrom, Jewish people, businesses, and homes targeted with violence. Anti Semitism his Jewish people in the south hard, though many made a strong effort to assimilate. There were Jewish slave owners, though mostly urban Jews with slaves as household servants, very few plantation owners. There were a few Jewish Confederate officers, and Judah Benjamin as the CSA Secy of State. But Benjamin faced enormous hostility. Had the CSA won and become independent, no doubt anti Semitism would have worsened. The Jewish community was strongly involved in the civil rights movement. Racists often baited protesters as \"Jew controlled\" just like the KKK is doing right now with the young man murdered in Missouri. Most southern whites in the 1960s likely saw Jews as white, but still not like themselves. ",
