            "answer_text": "Probably the founder of Scientology, L Ron Hubbard. Shortly after the US entered the war Hubbard, a Lieutenant in the Navy Reserve, found himself posted to Australia. Despite this being a vital time in the war he was swiftly packed aboard a ship back to the US because the American naval attach\u00e9 to Australia received numerous complaints about him being a nuisance and attempting to perform tasks for which he was not qualified. After arriving back in the States he was given command of an armed freighter being fitted out in Boston. This ship was commissioned in late July 1942 and by late September the Naval Commander in the area removed Hubbard from command and recommended that he not be given command of another vessel. Remarkably by April of 43 he found himself in command of a sub chaser patrolling the west coast. That was when the fun really started. In May 1943 he claimed to have sunk a Japanese sub and delivered a 19 page report describing the battle. The navy on the other hand believed he had wasted depth charges attacking what was either a shoal of fish or a magnetic anomaly. In June 1943 he believed that he had had spotted a Japanese sub on the surface and attacked with his deck guns. Unfortunately he did this in Mexican territorial waters. Moreover, the \u201csubmarine\u201d turned out to be one of the Coronado Islands which also happened to be garrisoned by Mexican naval personnel. Hubbard was promptly removed from command a second time and navy brass recommended that he should only serve in a position where he could be supervised. Having recently enjoyed the Tom Hanks movie \u2018Greyhound\u2019 I hope Tom Cruise makes a film about Hubbards wartime shenanigans. ",

            "answer_text": "I would nominate three men: Lt Commander Wilfred A. Walter, commander of the WIlliam D. Porter, the most disastrous ship in the US Navy. His worthless exploits read like a comedy of errors except he almost killed FDR by launching a torpedo at his flagship, among many other errors. He was a total abortion of a commander. Lt Commander James Marks of the USS Hull who was the model for Captain Queeg in the \u201cCaine Mutiny\u201d. He was so hated and such a miserable ship handler that during Halsey\u2019s Typhoon, the crew and wardroom convinced the XO to take command of the ship before the Captain killed them all. On his way to the bridge, the commander executed a foolish maneuver and the ship capsized killing 262 men. There were very few survivors, but Marks was one of them. Sailors who survived and had nothing good to say about Marks were prohibited from testifying and Marks got off. If ever there was a piece of shit, it was Lt Commander James Marks And finally, incompetent blowhard Adm Bull Halsey who must have gone senile or had a stroke sometime during the war as his emotional and strategic abilities absolutely disappeared. He started crying on the Quarterdeck when criticized by Nimitz; he abandoned the invasion fleet he was charged to protect for a glory-seeking goose chase that cost many many men and ships and he led the entire fleet into deadly typhoons not once but twice. He was not really a captain, but he was worse because he was captain of a fleet. He should have been sacked early. ",
