            "answer_text": "Camera obscuras similar to the one pictured below were used as drawing aids since at least the 1560s. Similar devices using a concave mirror or a pinhole opening instead of a lens have a much longer history, stretching back to antiquity.  The earliest cameras used to take actual photographs by pioneers such as Ni\u00e9pce, Talbot and Daguerre date to the 1820s and 30s (likely several decades earlier in the case of Thomas Wedgwood - although none of his in-camera pictures survive). Some of the cameras used by the pioneers still exist, and have of course been extensively photographed ever since. Here is a (relatively) modern day photograph of one of Fox Talbot\u2019s famous \u2018Mousetraps\u2019:  Maybe you were hoping to see the earliest photograph of a camera? As far as I can tell, Fox Talbot took some of the earliest in that genre: (A Calotype portrait being taken at Lacock Abbey, c. 1842)  ",

            "answer_text": "The first cameras ever made could not record a picture. Google the term \u201ccamera obscura\u201d. The first cameras were built in perhaps the 14th or the 15th century and likely evolved from observations of images projected through leaves and branches on trees to a smooth surface. Once the lens was invented, camera obscuras became popular as an amusement and as a tool used by painters of the time to sketch out landscapes. The invention of film came centuries later. The invention of the digital sensor came around 150 years after that. So, the answer is that the first camera likely occurred in nature and was not built. The first camera that was purpose built could not take a picture, but instead projected an image onto a light colored, smooth surface. ",
