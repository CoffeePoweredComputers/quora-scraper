            "answer_text": "Are you a Communist, Socialist or capitalist and why? Well Richard Bradley your question emphasizes the corruption of knowledge that exist in the world today, making complication where \u2018institutionalized ignorance\u2019 has replaced knowledge as the basis of academia. The three points of you question, magnify the lack of knowledge that is so common in America today. Communism and Socialism are synonyms for what? They identify the slavery of all the citizens to the desires of the state, noting else. While the word capitalism is only emphasizes the lack of knowledge Marx had, making up words to identify what he didn\u2019t know. The result, Marx created a word to identify his demagoguery lacking any foundations for its meaning. The why, he had no idea how commerce and enterprise work. As for the word\u2026created by Marx\u2026of capitalism, as he didn\u2019t know what he was expressing, it gets a bit difficult to know what he was talking about. In my experience, I first read\u2026or attempted to read\u2026the Communist Manifesto in the 7th grade. As I had a job since I was in the 4th grade, this fiction made little sense to me. The results were words that made no sense. Later in life, after my undergraduate degree, once more, I read it, with more understanding of enterprise, and commerce, my conclusion was the same as the 7th grade with the results words that made no sense. Having lived in the world for three score, ten and a few more years, most of which was in the engineering world, and in business analysis, there are major problems with commerce, and enterprise, created by the application of corporations. The concept of holding companies, bank financing, and stockholders, all who are removed from the actual enterprise, in my conclusion, creates problems. One of the miracles of America\u2019s beginnings was the corporate catastrophe of Caribbean Corporations, which led to this nation, rejecting corporations, was one of the foundations of strength that created the wonder\u2026once\u2026of the American form of enterprise. If one reads the Communist Manifesto, and the \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 of Marx\u2019s fantasy, \u2018Das Capital,\u2019 which makes J.K. Rowling a realist. The conundrum is that in America, with the foundations of the most\u2026known to now\u2026even with the tripartite of Banks, Corporations, and the congress and tax laws, applying slavery to the society, the best known, is unknown, while academia is indoctrinating our society with socialism, communism, and government slavery, subsidized by the same government. To make is more incomprehensible is government allows students to put themselves in the debt of slavery to advance this instruction of anti-American indoctrination. Sadly, as the identification have been so corrupted, and the choices of communist, socialist, or corporate capitalist are really by application the same, makes me wonder what would I call myself. The closest thing of my choice, is personal liberty\u2026which is unknown in any society today\u2026and that commerce of free-choice is the best form of a society having any economic activity. As for government, the idea, the vision of a Republic with independent sovereign states, as America was designed, and enumerated central planning of government would be what I have come to conclude is the only way to have a government, and reject the central planning of state totalitarian sovereignty. Governments, since the first government, rejected individual liberty. It has been unknown in the empirical history of mankind, but as Marx was a dreamer of, I\u2019d say we all can have a vision of our own utopia. ",

I am a Christian, therefore I subscribe to communalism as an ideal (Acts 4:32\u201335). I am a Christian, therefore I subscribe to a socialised society (Mt 25:31\u201346). I am a Christian, therefore I do not subscribe to the employment of usury which \u201ccapitalism\u201d is fully dependent upon, and which is condemned by the three major Abramic religions = Judaism, Christianity & Islam. What is referred to in the USA as \u201cCapitalism\u201d is in fact the usury of individualistic monetarists. The premise, is that the many will be exploited for the sole benefit of the very few. It is the worst of all systems and has historically only ever culminated in social & economic decline. The reason Donald Trump advocated \u201cLets make America great again\u201d is as everyone on the planet can observe, the USA is in social & economic decline because of its pursuit of individualistic monetarism. Modern business in the creation of the Corporation and the Finance Industries (Banking & Insurance) employs the socialised precepts of voluntary collectivism. Since the rise of the corporation, the worker (the means of production) can acquire shared ownership in their enterprises, thus directly benefiting in their efforts (cp. 1 Thess 3:10\u201312). Also the universal suffrage movements of the 19th & 20th centuries have led to a decline in the individualistic monetarists (\u201cCapitalists\u201d) ability to exploit the worker. Their influence declines as the worker is given participation in government, and laws are enforced to prevent their exploitation. Also, those who hoard money(individualistic monetarists) have little value in a technological world, where collective organisation can readily raise the capital needed to build an enterprise, and where intellectual capital has exceedingly greater value to the world community than money.

            "answer_text": "I'm a capitalist and before I tell you why, let me differentiate between communism and socialism. Definitions : It is very likely to note that socialism slightly differs from communism in such a way that in a socialist society, property and wealth distribution is not owned by the state but by the community. Communism is just an extreme version of socialism which usually borrows or re-creates some of its features. [1] Now that we've got it out of the way, let me explain why I'm not only a capitalist, but capitalism matters. Structuring of capitalism. In a capitalist state, the means of production are controlled by the individual rather than the state. This gives a person greater freedoms to control his way of life by producing what he wishes.  The person can also wish to choose his own high quality products and even improve his standard of living by selling his products for a profit, thus increasing his wealth and quality of life. [2]  What is even better is that wealth decisions are made made by the individual, which means that he or she has a choice to freely invest in any market he desires and, through competitive markets accumulate as much wealth as possible. [3]  Furthermore, the great individualist nature given by it provides great incentives, not only for the rich but also middle class people. This gives him the opportunity to make a great product choice which will benefit him as well as opt to produce if no choice is fit for him.  The resultant structure of the free market gives it more incentive to invent, innovate and invest which not only make life better but also easier. It also creates a win-win situation whereby the rich get more wealth and the poor higher quality products.[4] The structure given by the market enables it not only to give freedoms for wealth productivity but also for other freedoms as well. Freedoms such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom of association are only found in most countries that possess a truly capitalist model. The problem with communism's model. Communism's structure claims to cater for the needs of a society by equally distributing wealth to the poor. [5]  This has proved to be difficult as communists have failed to create the necessary incentives for wealth to distribute. This, further more, leads to continuous cycles of power and wealth consolidation, tyrannisation and eventually societal backwardness.  Many of the Communist states established had either failed to realize this problem or responded to it wrongly, thus solidifying their control of wealth and eventually this lead to poverty. [6]  This has followed time and again across all Communist states. This is no wonder capitalism has able to do way better than it in every aspect of economics. This is due to the fact that : Over a billion people have lifted themselves from poverty due to capitalism's applications in former socialist areas.The free market has led to the growth of various national economies, many of which have little to no natural resources. E.g.: Hong Kong.The innovative nature of the capitalist model has led to the increasing of living standards, quality of life and wealth creation. Since the 20th century, capitalism has grown global life expectancy by almost 2 decades.Communism has ruined more countries than any other ideology, including Nazism. Estimates are that over a billion people's lives were ruined and about 100 million people \u2018s lives were killed.This, among many other things is why capitalism matters over any other ideology. Yet people still blame capitalism for the world's problems. It is highly ignorant of those who have expressed this sentiment. No politico-economic system in history has ever proved its value so eloquently or has benefited mankind so greatly as capitalism\u2014and none has ever been attacked so savagely, viciously, and blindly. The flood of misinformation, misrepresentation, distortion, and outright falsehood about capitalism is such that the young people of today have no idea (and virtually no way of discovering any idea) of its actual nature.\u201d AYN RAND.

            "answer_text": "I am a democratic socialist and a reformist. I am a socialist because i believe that capitalism is destructive to human spirit. In a world where most workers don\u2019t own the tools of their trade (\u201cthe means of production\u201d), a worker is in fact reduced to the status of a russian serf who can choose their master but cannot choose not to have one. I am convinced that the one who plows a field should own it, and in turn he who owns the field should be the one who plows it. Democratic because i don\u2019t see how socialism can be anything but democratic. I was born in a country that was socialist by name because the workers owned the means of production and all that on paper, but in fact had no say about how they should operate. It didn\u2019t help workers much. Once their basic needs were satisfied they\u2019ve lost all their enthusiasm and fallen into apathy as they knew they had little control over their lives. And they couldn\u2019t even choose their masters as the authoritative state owned everything. Tash Lai's answer to What do you think of 21st century socialism, is it possible to find a way to implement it in the world and specifically in western countries? Reformist, because i really do want to distance myself from those who wish for an instant change right now, today, with little understanding of what they are going to do after they\u2019ve overthrown the government and little concern for the majority who neither understands their goals nor is ready to accept them. I do however believe that, and it is especially true for Russia, modern society is too obedient and that sometimes it is necessary to break a few windows. The oppressed minority has the right to resort to violence if nothing else works. Or if the government wages an agressive war and denies doing so, people have the right to force it to stop, begin an investigation, and punish those responsible. But it doesn\u2019t mean you should break all the windows and burn the house while so many people are still inside. ",

            "answer_text": "I am a Capitalist, for the most part. To be clear about definitions here (because there have been a lot of misconceptions going around, especially about Socialism): Capitalism is a system in which private entities own the means of production and trade, for the purpose of profit.Socialism is a system in which social entities own the means of production and trade.Communism is a system in which all property is publicly owned, each person works according to his or her abilities and is paid according to his or her needs, and this system is accomplished through violent class war.I am a Capitalist because I believe in the power of merit and I use benchmarking to look at how various economies around the world operate and what their successes and failures represent. The merit part comes from incentives. In a Capitalist system, you are richly (sometimes too richly) rewarded for taking risks and pursuing innovation. In non-Capitalist systems, such actions (which can produce astonishing progress) are not incentivized, which can result in stagnation and lost opportunities, both for individuals and for society. The benchmarking part comes from this: the most successful countries in the world, in terms of metrics that include wealth, social mobility, economic mobility, health, happiness, and productivity, are all Capitalist. They are also all Social Democracies (something that many in the US refer to as Socialism, which is incorrect). In practice, I am not a pure Capitalist though. If you take a good look, you see that when each of the three systems is unleashed without control, they quickly eliminate their own advantages: When Capitalism is unleashed without control, the wealthy and powerful seize the means of production. They monopolize and organize to eliminate competition, which allows the owner class to dictate the terms of the market (as in, it\u2019s no longer a free market). They can then charge the maximum for their goods and services, compensate their workers at the bare minimum, and hoard the fruits of everyone\u2019s labor. You can see that the advantages of Capitalism, which include innovation and social mobility, are severely curtailed by what amounts to a merchant aristocracy. It\u2019s true that some hard-working and clever souls can break into that kind of system\u2026but many who would succeed in a more balanced system are left destitute\u2026many opportunities are missed. Look into the late 19th and early 20th centuries to see what this looks like.When Socialism is unleashed without control, it simply replaces the current upper class (whether aristocratic or capitalist) with a state-based one. This is because even though Socialism, like many other systems, can be applied in a limited way (I\u2019ll get to that), it is often associated with total social control (via the state) of the means of production. This kind of centralized control benefits whoever is in charge and eliminates any kind of market pressure, which leaves consumers powerless. And, as mentioned before, personal incentives for innovation largely vanish.Communism is definitely the worst of the three because it actively pushes for violence. It rapidly replaces an existing system (whether aristocratic or capitalist) with one that is technically Socialist but goes further by dictating how compensation works and eliminating private property. This has an even worse effect on personal incentives. And, as with a fully Socialist economy, it simply replaces the existing upper class with a new one.An interesting point here is that many of these \u201cpure\u201d systems have worked dramatically well when first introduced, allowing for great advances and riches\u2026until the detriments built up. So, given the above, you can probably tell that I\u2019m a Socially Democratic Capitalist. I believe (and I find that this belief is well-supported by data) that measured state involvement in the market is necessary to keep Capitalism in its best state. I\u2019m not a Communist because it advocates violence and requires a major shift in government, economy, and society. I\u2019m not a Socialist mostly because of the incentive problem\u2026but I do think that limited Socialism can be a good thing. What I mean by that is that some companies might be better off as cooperatives (i.e. controlled by all of the employees) or as partially (or majority) owned by the workers. This is technically Socialist\u2026but because they are a self-contained private entity, it is also Capitalist. As a final note, things like universal healthcare, robust safety nets, government regulations, taxpayer-funded infrastructure, and taxpayer-funded education are not Socialist. You could make an argument that taxpayer-funded education is but I think it would be an uphill battle. Thanks Richard for the A2A! ",

It\u2019s the only framework that gives you the most personal freedom and the ability to enjoy the full reward of the work you do for others or yourself. What it not automatically does is keeping predatory types (*) in check. But neither communism nor socialism or any other social-economic system does that. This requires permanent vigilance and a framework that constantly watches out to keep checks and balances working or how I put it, upholds the three pillars of a sustainable society - transparency, cooperation and competition. Adam Smith on this problem in the economic realm, 250 years ago: \u201cThe interest of the dealers [=monopolists, predatory types], however, in any particular branch of trade or manufacture, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public. To widen the market and to narrow the competition, is always the interest of the dealers. To widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be against it, and can serve only to enable the dealers [=monopolists, predatory types], by raising their profits above what they naturally would be, to levy, for their own benefit, an absurd tax upon the rest of their fellow-citizens.\u201d&\u201cThe proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order [=monopolists, predatory types], ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention. It comes from an order of men [=monopolists, predatory types], whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public, who have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public, and who accordingly have, upon many occasions, both deceived and oppressed it.\u201d The same applies to politics. Please ask yourself why \u2018socialist\u2019/\u2019communist\u2019 countries upon establishing themselves start to kill, exile or suppress political competition/opposition?! Democracy doesn\u2019t do that. Free market capitalism itself doesn\u2019t prohibit competition to enter a market.The opposite is right in the definition even:\u201cCapitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. Characteristics central to capitalism include private property, capital accumulation, wage labor, voluntary exchange, a price system, and competitive markets.\u201d Anti competitive rules and involuntary exchanges are being enforced by society and its force/power, not by the economic system. Democracy rests this force/power with a democratic framework, which on paper contains checks and balances; or in other words - transparent, cooperative and competitive rules on how this force/power is wielded/controlled without privileges for any special group.But that only works if society (by accident or not) does not create power- and resourceful entities (via rules that create economic or political monopolies) that then start to influence politics or civil servants for their personal benefit. And as chance has it, there is actually just such a mechanic right at the core of all our democratic capitalist/socialist societies, that no one is talking about and 99.9% are completely ignorant of (even the ones profiting from it), but which does exactly that..Joan Spark's answer to When did most of the world switch to fiat money, and why did it happen? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 *) predatory types are individuals or organizations who through force/power make you do things that you don\u2019t want to do. They do not adhere to the principle of \u2018voluntary exchange\u2019, they oppose it.The only thing that keeps them from dominating is transparent competion with other predatory types IMHO.Any society that allows or enforces monopolies will sooner or later find, that those predatory types take up those niches and will dominate and successively destroy that society as through their action they acquire all resources of that society, which leaves only revolting to the rest of it.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a Voluntaryist. People often describe governmental systems as socialist, communist, or capitalist, saying that a particular country has a \u201ccapitalist government,\u201d or a \u201csocialist government.\u201d Communism and Capitalism are terms that actually describe economic systems, which, in theory, can be independent from government. Socialism is more likely a governmental system by which industries are socialized. When government is involved in the economy, authority and coercion is added to the mix. The question to be asked is no longer whether or not one prefers communism or capitalism, it\u2019s whether or not you prefer more authority or less. Government uses force (by taxation) to implement any of its decisions. For instance, every time you get a paycheck after working in the US, you will see that money was pulled out for Social Security. Regardless of whether or not it works effectively, there are many US citizens who would rather not pay into social security, just as there are many US citizens who don\u2019t want their tax payer dollars subsidizing certain industries. Once the government has mandated something, there is no choice. If you refuse, you will be punished. If you don\u2019t vote, welp, you\u2019re still mandated to follow the laws that the elected candidates spew into the system. You\u2019re told that taxation is the price that you have to pay for living in civilized society, yet you didn\u2019t chose to be born into a system that uses force. You\u2019re told that you imply your consent to the system if you vote in the system\u2019s elections, but let\u2019s say that one candidate wants to commit genocide against the particular group that you associate with, and you want to vote against them. Voting is self-defense in some cases. They\u2019ll say you consent if you drive on the system\u2019s roads, but you also need to use the roads in order to vote, or obtain medical services, if need be. Not using their roads would limit your ability to participate with the civilized society of which you may benefit by providing services or charity. There is no social contract that we signed which gave the government consent to the atrocities that some face, yet we are all told in Government 101 class that \u201cthe consent of the governed\u201d is necessary for the legitimacy of government. It is my belief that voluntary societies are the only ones that are ethical and effective. We enter into many contractual and consensual agreements with other parties all the time. It\u2019s only your fault if you don\u2019t read the terms & conditions provided! If one wanted to enter into a contract with other people who desired a distributive system akin to Social Security, one could, and it would be much more effective as well. There would be many choices too, and if there wasn\u2019t a group with the policies that one desired, they could create a better one with hopes that other people would see why theirs is better as well. If one desired social distribution, they could contract into a system that distributes much like socialism, and if one desired a system by which the only distribution occurring was the distribution that naturally occurred by the market, they could contract into that system. Both would get fair amounts of participants as well, because yes, people have differing values, and that is precisely why coercion by government is discriminatory, and precisely why a free society is the only ethical option.

            "answer_text": "I am a mainland Chinese who received education in the US. I name myself a pragmatic socialist. Economically, I support capitalism with government oversight. A pure capitalistic society will be hell on earth. There will not be social warfare - (disabled, old, or sick people will be left to die since they don\u2019t contribute financially), no oversight on environment protection (pandas and koala will be killed since it cost more to protect them), and no justice (rich people can pay to get out of jail while poor can\u2019t). No country to date has pure capitalism. Similarly, a pure communist or socialist country will also be hell. Pure socialism entails social ownership of the means of production. We have seen over and over again when people live in a pure social/state ownership country, they don\u2019t work. My grandparents lived through communnist China where everyone gets same payment and living conditions. My grandpa said he saw people standing/sitting by the fields and literally let the crops die. When you have a collective of farmers have no problem letting crops die, you get famine, scientific stagnation, and financial disaster. Human condition (or the vast majority I should say) always wants to put in as little effort as possible when there is no rewards. Deng Xiao Ping said no matter it is a black or white cat, as long as it can catch mice, it is a good cat. I completely support this sentiment. I believe in a moderate form of socialism that encourages economic growth. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not any of those, I\u2019m a social democrat. In other words, I\u2019m part socialist and part capitalist. I believe in a regulated market economy, where the state directly controls and runs key services like the armed forces, police, emergency services, health and social care, social security, prisons and probation, libraries, museums, education, and train and bus services. It should also own the energy and communications infrastructure. This is because I believe the profit motive and price mechanism are flawed, though necessary. In the UK at the moment, we are experiencing the painful failure of the neo liberal obsession with private ownership. This is being played out in private care homes and mental health units where vulnerable people are being tortured and abused. We\u2019re seeing it in the failure in our part privatised rail network and in the decline in bus use, when we desperately need to cut carbon emissions. The Huawai security scandal also demonstrates that an unlimited market economy can threaten national security. The state also has a role to play in research and development and innovation. It should help industries restructure, and not let areas decline, and people go to waste. Yes, developing an effective \u2018industrial policy\u2019 is challenging, but without it we create anger and inequality. Neo liberalism doesn\u2019t lead to healthy economies, but to inflated assets and stagnant, shrinking markets as the rich get richer and the poor, poorer, and the middle classes are squeezed. Ultimately, unregulated capitalism ends up with fascism and war. Beyond the state sector, the economy should be largely socially owned by individuals and communities, using co-ops and mutuals. The financial sector needs to be restructured and made accountable. Big business shouldn\u2019t be making the most important decisions in a democracy. A lot of people in the United States confuse socialism with social democracy. Social democrats actually oppose socialism because we understand the weaknesses of the state and the importance of private property, initiative and individualism. Socialism promises \u2018one size fits all\u2019 easy answers. It seems mainly to lead to economic stagnation and authoritarianism. No one said getting the balance right between private and public was ever going to be easy. But we need to ditch false neo liberal assumptions and start to rebalance our economies in favour of the people, not big business. We also need to learn from the big failures of the left in the past and build something new and better, not repeat the mistakes the left has made since the time of the Jacobins. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a capitalist because I have seen the failures of communism and socialism time and time again. All one must do is study the various government cycles to see the effects the size and scope of government power have on the majority. You will find two common occurrences. 1. highly socialistic or communistic societies don\u2019t last very long from a relative standpoint, several generations at best and they never do what is in the best interest of the majority, instead, benefiting special interests and/or the ruling class themselves. Castros Cuba and Lenin's Soviet Union as examples of the latter. The entire concept of government is to allegedly do what is in the best interests of the majority, and neither socialism or communism have even done this. As Thomas Jefferson stated, \u201cthat government is best which governs least\u201d and boy it seems he was right on the money. Before their deaths, both he and Adams were already disappointed by the short history of the ruling class and their endeavors to utilize taxation and the majorites wealth for their own special interests. I fear as long as governments exist, the pockets of the majority will always be pilfered by those in power and redistributed to their special interests. There are really only the three systems as you noted in your question so if two of them always fail, then you really have only one, however imperfect, left to go with. Current day Zomia in SE Asia and the Irish Celts from about 650 AD to 1650 AD are two examples of anarchist societies; with no government force or coercion. They obvious are and did govern themselves individually. The Irish are said to have had family structures where heads of households worked together voluntarily to achieve social goals such as defense and mitigation of disputes and they were the most prosperous civil society in the whole of Europe until they were finally overthrown by the Monarchs of Europe around 1650. We got them back though some 50 years or so later, didn\u2019t we, with the American, French and British revolutions and 70 years or so later with the abolition of slavery. Obviously, we may have won some huge battles for liberty, but we have not yet won the big one. ",

A system that will promote an egalitarian society based on a mixed economy where a Government is designated to provide the nation with what can be classified as the \u201cessential services\u201d to cover the \u201cneeds\u201d of the people while the private sector can provide for the \u201cwants\u201d in a fair, honest and safe manner. I believe that politics should never be allowed to become a career and every politician should be limited to no more than two or three consecutive terms in office. I believe that the Supreme Court should be denied the ability to make law and that every decision of the Supreme Court must unanimous. If unanimity can\u2019t be reached the problem must be handed back to Congress to resolve. All split decisions are flawed decisions because they are based on personal opinions, bias, upbringing, prejudices, and politics. They are never based on the proper legal interpretation of the way the law is written. No small group of unelected people should ever be allowed to assume the intent and meaning of a law, let alone the Constitution, and thereby usurp the responsibility and authority of Congress. If a law, and a Constitution, cannot be read and understood by any reasonably educated person then it is very poorly written. A nation\u2019s Constitution should be made a compulsory subject in the curriculum of every High School in the nation. I also believe no person should ever have the power to veto the will of Congress nor should any single person have executive authority to override Congress or impose their own personal views. The only executive authority a Head of State should have, in their role as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, should be to declare war if the nation were to come under military attack by a foreign Government. All other military deployments, in any role, should be the responsibility of Congress. ",

My goal, as Marxist, is working class ownership of the \u201cmeans of life\u201d. Why? Because I think economic power should be as decentralized and democratically managed as possible, and that people should have as much say as possible in the things which affect them most (like making a living\u2026.). As a Marxist, I am not opposed to \u201cfree trade\u201d, which existed since time immemorial, and which can be formalized as \u201cCommodity produced for exchange\u2014via Money\u2014for another Commodity\u201d: C-M-C. What I am opposed to is a system (which I call \u201ccapitalism\u201d\u2014or Kapitalism with a \u201cK\u201d, if you like) which is characterized by private (minority) ownership of the means of life under conditions of market competition, and which prioritizes the maximization of profit, and which allocates labor and resources accordingly: Money is invested in Commodities for the overriding goal of gaining MORE Money: M- C - MM (or M\u2019, i.e. \u201cM prime\u201d). Why am I opposed to a \u201c M-C-M\u2019 \u201d system? Because the goal of capital accumulation, while tending to create a certain kind of material abundance (Marx eloquently praises capitalism\u2019s productive and innovative capacity), is incapable of meeting needs which cannot appear in the market as \u201cdemand\u201d, and it depends on endless growth (like cancer, or like a Ponzi scheme) for its continued survival as a system; and because private, minority ownership of the means of life alienates the vast majority of people from control over that most basic of human life support: production. That, anyway, are some of the reasons I am a communist (in the Marxist sense of the word\u2014not the Stalinist sense of the word, which is the Orwellian opposite of what Marx meant by it). Why \u201ccommunism\u201d per se (as opposed to the more \u201cintermediate\u201d\u2014and frankly \u201cfraught\u201d\u2014 \u201csocialism\u201d)? That is, why (using the Marxist sense of the word) a condition of society free from State coercive power, where individual people meet each other\u2019s individual variable needs using their distinct and variable individual abilities? Because it seems like \u201cheaven on earth\u201d to me (as close as earth can get to heaven, anyway). As a Christian, this seems like a good thing to me: \u201cAnd all that believed were together, and had all things common; and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need\u201d (Acts 2:44\u201345). There are many devils on many proposed paths of how to get \u201cthere\u201d\u2026. But \u201cthere\u201d seems like a lovely place to me. ",

I believe strongly in a mixed economy, with markets but also in stuff like universal healthcare (at least on a base level) and education. I think that the government and corporations/companies should work together to solve their problems rather than apart (aka what they have been doing throughout human history). I do not subscribe to the supply side or demand side entirely, but rather believe that the economic policies of a country should be in constant swing and adaptable. Sometimes a planned economy is better, for example in situations of crisis or war. Other times, more \u201chands-off\u201d approaches help develop the economy in the long run while providing people with more freedom and advancement. I care more deeply about the social/legislative abilities of a country rather than its economic policies since a flexible government is required to be able to quickly adapt to various situations. ",

I know that during my time in the Soviet Union there was less choice of goods, but there was more family time, less stress about losing job, access to medical care, no homelessness, and more closeness of community. People talk about freedoms. What is this? If I can complain about government but I am homeless, who cares? Or if I can say the President stinks but die from lack of medical care? Times were hard in Soviet Union during and after Great Patriotic War. But at least we had hope. Pride in being great nation. In U.S. better supermarkets. More money. Fancier house. Daughter\u2019s house is bigger than flat of Soviet Premier. But more loneliness too. Do not know neighbors. They cut lawn and go to work. Never met them. One neighborhood rich while another with homes boarded windows. Ford plant closed, people take opioid to cope. People here make too much of secret police and gulag. You say what you want at home. But so long as not making trouble trouble never find you. I see this society break down. There is moral and spiritual decay here, like in Soviet Union during Gorbachev. Very bad things ahead. Very bad. Fascism will come again. ",

            "answer_text": "Neither any of the current economical systems. A new system fitting the needs of the modern era is required. Why the choice is limited to capitalism, socialism or communism? Those are philosophies of the previous millennium:  Capitalism \u2013 Socialism-Communism- Theocracy- Liberalism- don\u2019t have the answers for the needs of the modern 21 century people's. ---All failed and are not the way to follow---  My personal interest is what is the best economic and life style for all in this century?  On the table we have all the traditional systems and the additional new systems -Globalization and the Chinese mixture of communism and capitalism blended with the Chinese Confucianism.  What are the results of the 2 new philosophies? Chines style works for the Chinese people used to follow the Confucius philosophy for the last 2500 years. I don\u2019t think that it is applicable for people following other life styles.  Globalization , is some aspects works ( millions from the third world joined the middle class) and in many other aspects it is a catastrophe. Top 65 Billionaires have more than the 3.5 milliard people in the word\"\" The figure was disclosed on Davos economic forum.  The people on the west struggled for over 100 years for 8 working hours, illness, vacation, retirement benefits. However due the globalization competition focusing on: - making more money - transferring work from the west countries to undeveloped countries and fear of losing the job to  - People on the developing world are lucky to get jobs but don\u2019t get western social benefits.  And combined with *The decrease of working unions and social party's power *People brainwashed that they will fulfill their economic and career dreams by giving away they social rights  For the last 3 decades they are losing jobs and social rights Only few people had major economic benefits from the globalization ___________ What should be done? A new pragmatic ideology is needed to deal with the 21 century needs. Alternative economic system or alternative life style? Or both: revised economical system encouraging a descent life for all? The question of life philosophy is the leading question. Economy systems are a part of a life philosophy. Following my personal opinion:  From all the systems \u2013 Capitalism, Socialism, Communism, Theocracy: Capitalism proved to be the best partial solution. It is closed to human being nature---not an ideal system, but up today, in the real world, on the long run, no system worked better for the majority. The globalization capitalism could be a better solution, lifting the economic status of many people worldwide and same time improving their social rights and life quality.  Unfortunately not by the way it is implemented by the greedy global capitalism.  What should be changed? \u201cGovernment of the people, by the people \"' FOR THE PEOPLE \"\" This basic rule has been forgotten by the US and EU politicians and changed into:. GOVERNMENT FOR THE GLOBAL COMPANIES AND 00.1% REACH PEOPLE\u201d 1: People benefit from competition! But only the fair competition! Compete by creating values on initiative, creativity, efficiency, quality but not on labor without equal social rights for the workers. Work transfer should be limited by international conventions to countries and enterprises providing the same social benefits to the people. It should be enforced by international lows.  2: Create new company's values evaluations standard and report. It will replace the current method of quarter and end year companies reports based only on income and revenues.  It will be used by investors. The values of companies with high scores on the followings will be higher and they will get priority on government and public bids. Include factors such as: * Equality level of employs salaries and bonus. *Percentage of employs with personal limited capabilities. * Management Bonuses played on 4 years delay   3:*Differentiation between the highest and lower salary and bonus of government and public companies should be limited to the scale of 1 to 8.  4: Create a new type of companies- social companies \u2013that will be rewarded by governments and public sector. Creativity and investment on human being life improvement should be encouraged. Not only direct money making. Example: A company that finds an idea that will reduced the crime rate in a given area by 20% should get 50% of the governmental savings for a couple of years on the road.  5: Update the scheme of direct taxation. --Young people are low however they have initial higher expenses required to build a family. Make the life of young people building families easier. Combine the progressive tax system with an age depending tax system. - Change the progressive income tax system as well the VAT taxes..  6: Families should be encouraged to spend more time with their children. In a family with children up age 10 years, were the 2 parents combined working hours is 1.5 the current law hours, the tax reduction should equal the salary of 1.8 hours. ",

China is a socialist capitalist state that bases its political architecture on meritocracy, the same method US corporations use to select its leaders. I think American capitalism has morphed into a oligarchy and that is bad. Russia and China both turned to communism because of it. Capitalism as practiced by the Nordic states seems the right balance and that\u2019s where Sanders and younger Democrats are headed. The US already has socialist functions like Medicare for seniors, the VA, Medicaid, the postal system, and even \u2018state owned enterprises\u2019. We are missing healthcare and affordable education to keep America great. ",

The money you have is YOURS, I believed in higher taxes for the rich to provide for the poor, but now I think that there should be lower taxes on EVERYONE. No one should provide for anyone in terms of finance. I see a beggar on the street asking me for change, I walk past with my jingling pockets and I ignore him. How do I know that they\u2019re for real? Everyone has the capability to make the right choices in life, if you make the wrong ones, then that\u2019s not my problem and it\u2019s not the problem of society.

It follows from respecting the inherent worth of others, that there must be a market free from coercion, which means free from government. No one who cares about others promotes the state. You cannot claim to care about other people then act directly against their interests by promoting the biggest bully on the block. There is no compassion when you cannot even bring yourself to recognize basic respect for persons. The government isn\u2019t us, it isn\u2019t self rule, and it isn\u2019t just. We cannot tell the representatives \u201cno\u201d when they demand our property or our labor, merely to support the parasite class (all government workers). Furthermore central planning and control has always been a dismal failure in comparison to free people. Free people all looking for opportunities spot trends and needs, No one can be omniscient most especially mindless bureaucrats who never have to live in the real world. Peaceful, voluntary, REAL solutions are what compassionate people purpose. Capitalism is the only choice here that allows for peaceful voluntary solution. ",

If you don\u2019t take Marxism in a dogmatic religious way, then you are equipped with a very powerful all-inclusive socio-economic theory which shows the way to a much more human Economic System, then the predatory current, which is slavery in the grip of the Capitalistic Moloch.

            "answer_text": "I am a free market Social Capitalist. I think the free market works remarkably well in creating wealth, but does an exceptionally poor job of distributing that wealth. Because of that, I think that strong unions are required to protect workers where necessary. I think that when a capitalist free market meets a product or service that is hugely inelastic, the market can not respond to that responsibly, maintaining profits while providing services to all who need them. Insulin is a perfect example. It is relatively inexpensive to make, and hugely expensive to buy. The only reason for that is that demand is inelastic. I believe in most areas, the market should be left as free as those in the market have shown themselves to be responsible. If you get a product or service that kills people, regulation is necessary. If the businesses in a market work within that market responsibly, they should be left free. The free market should be as free as it can be without hurting or killing people. ",

Socialists advocate simply that workers should own or at least have democratic control over they place they work at. We all think we know what capitalism is but in practice it\u2019s something very different. I\u2019m a socialist because worker cooperatives already work and have a 50\u201375 year history of bringing higher wages to their workers like Mondragon. Capitalism and the idea of free markets doesn\u2019t exist. To be a free market consumers have to willingly enter the market and be able to willingly leave. Also for a few market to exist in any real sense consumers have to have knowledge of what things ought to cost. The private health insurance industry doesn\u2019t allow for free will or a knowledgeable consumer. Many markets are like this but the people at the top just don\u2019t care because they got rich off of it. ",

I did my own research, and find that western media have been using national capitalist countries like China and Soviet Union to attack communism, although these two were not even socialist society. Through my years of work, I observed and knew how those capitalists ruthlessly exploit the labours and peasants. I know many people here on Quora like to defend capitalism. I fully understand that. Capitalists have brainwashed many people through years of education on how communism is a bad thing in practice. Communism is so badly described in the west, and since people are likely to like something when they hate the opposite, it\u2019s not strange to see people hate communism. Capitalists fear communism. It\u2019s not because communists kill capitalists or they will slaughter people like Nazis, it\u2019s just because they know at this stage, the only way to build a communist society is to hand over their means of production to the public. No one is willing to give up their previous life with wealth and power. ",

It wasnt until capitalism was regulated that we had a middle and lower middle class. Before the great depression most of america lived in total poverty. Only 20% of americans owned property. There was a government report released in the spring of 1929 that said the average american family has 2. something kids, they made 2000 dollars a year. the highest it has ever been. What wasnt released was the bottom part that said for them to afford decent housing, good food, take their kids to a doctor or dentist needed to make 5000 a year. ",

I think that regulated capitalism works well for the majority of goods and services, but that there are some types of goods and services that it does not work well for, for a variety of reasons. Those goods and services should be handled in a different way; the most likely option is a dollop of socialism in the form of having the government either provide or oversee the provision of those things. Most importantly, I think the economy exists to serve a social purpose; capitalism isn\u2019t inherently either morally correct or morally wrong. It\u2019s a system that exists because it serves the purposes of society. If there are areas where it doesn\u2019t serve that purpose well, we have no obligation to merely stand by and watch. ",

I would never understand how someone can claim ownership of resource like land and all his/her ancestor has to do is to kill or cheat locals out of their ownership. Capitalism is a system of fucking others over something, land, freedom,life. Socialism is a form of government created by more advanced societies with betterment of mankind at heart. Democratic socialism is perfect for transitioning to classless moneyless stateless society that Communism is. Mankind has no other way as to progress to there. Considering just that I`m a communist.

Given the varied meanings these words have and the many assumptions that people make about them, I find that labelling myself generally produces immediate misunderstandings. If by \u2018capitalist\u2019 is meant someone who supports, defends or apologises for capitalism (in any definition of that term), then I am not a capitalist. If by \u2018communist\u2019 is meant someone who advocate the politics of Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, Mao, Castro, Kim Jong-un, etc, or bases their politics on the states and actions they are associated with, then I\u2019m not a \u2018communist\u2019 If by \u2018socialist\u2019 is meant someone who is a follower or supporter of Labourist or social democratic politics, who actively pursues reforms of capitalism, or who actively advocates nationalisation of businesses, or health or welfare programmes, then I\u2019m not a socialist. If I\u2019m to label myself, I\u2019ll have to qualify the terminology. The closest I can come is to say that I\u2019m a Marxian, non-market socialist. Why? I\u2019m not a supporter of capitalism because its enormous capacity to go on increasing the quantity of goods in the shops is not` sustainable and is outweighed by its failings: the system is wasteful, it is exploitative, it is prone to major conflict; it ties down the majority of people to a life of servitude to others; it is unstable; it operates between very narrow tolerances, and it is uncontrollable. The bottom line is that it is incapable of meeting human social need. I\u2019m not a supporter of \u2018communism\u2019 in the sense described above. It is better described as a form of \u2018state capitalism\u2019. It therefore suffers from all the same flaws as private capitalism. I\u2019m not a supporter of Labourism or Social Democracy, because these are merely ways of attempting to manage or reform capitalism in the mistaken belief that it can be managed or reformed to the benefit of working people. Trying to make capitalism work in the interests of working people is like trying to make the slaughterhouse work on behalf of the cattle. It is a futile endeavour and does nothing to remedy the system\u2019s inherent flaws. The only solution I can currently see to the problems of capitalism are to dispose of it in its entirety. Whether that will happen or not is down to the mass of working people. If it doesn\u2019t then I don\u2019t have much hope for the future. ",

A democratic socialist sees fettered capitalism as both necessary and desirable for a healthy economy. However, when capitalism fails to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public-at-large it is the government's responsibility to ensure it. So, until businesses started selling rotten meats to us the food supply system was pure capitalism; in 1906, the people saw the need for government protection from diseased food being sold and regulations resulted. When businesses sold highly addictive products to consumers, again, the government stepped in. Other things like GPS are too expensive for capitalism to provide, again, government steps in. If you use GPS; you're a wee bit socialist. ",

Neither does pure capitalism. Washington has a worse infant mortality rate than many developing countries, many people have to work more than one minimum wage job to keep their heads above water and many are left without healthcare. Many people are now losing faith in democracy, because politicians are not representing them, and the gap between the very rich and the middle classes continues to grow. Quite a lot of young adults no longer bother to vote. So people start looking for other options, unfortunately the ones who offer easy solutions and proffer easy targets, foreigners, poofs etc,. are the ones who get listened to. Democracy needs a shot in the arm and nationalisation of the service industries is the solution. If a government cannot give the nation reasonably priced water, electricity, health etc., then vote them out. When two self aggrandising (add your own swear word) like Trump and Putin are trying to bring about the death of liberalism (read social liberties), then alarm bells should be ringing. Ironically, WWII was internationalism against nationalism, now two of the victors are trying to bring us back to the bad old, war torn days of nationalism. ",

You put some private profits and some public works in a pot, you empower people over here, direct them over there, slow this queue, fast track that one. Then you take the pulse and respiration. Record the temperature. The secret is to moderate. Nature loves a bell curve, with that big sexy bump in the middle. All the exploiters try to play the ends against the middle, but the middle is the muscle. Keep blending back to the center. If the 1% gets too carried away, if the workers unite against coming in on time, you use the gravity of the center to pull them back. Ok, sometimes a three bank shot requires you to talk like a socialist uprising to get the attention of Wall Street through their haze of smoke, but it is for the sake of the center, always. ",

So there have to be checks & balances to protect the economy for everyone: the more you make, the higher the taxes to compensate for the less fortunate who don\u2019t earn any extra to pay taxes, after all, we do need the windows washed, the garbage picked up & someone to serve the food. And they need to earn enough to enjoy life too. Those who benefit the most from the economy must invest more in that economy. Communism simply won\u2019t work because people are selfish & greedy. Why work harder than your neighbors if you don\u2019t earn any more? And why be creative or inventive if you don\u2019t reap the rewards of your efforts? You need some socialistic systems in place that help the economy work for everyone. Of course schools, road construction, fire, police, electrical grid, etc.. but also health care, welfare. The trouble is those welfare systems work best the closer they are to the problem. If you have the federal ggov.

            "answer_text": "I am a capitalist, first and foremost. Having said that, I believe that there is absolutely a role for socialist policies in a capitalistic society. In the U.S., for example, we have an interstate highway system which is routinely used in the distribution of goods and services. But that highway system was built and paid for, and is continuously maintained, with taxes. So, our interstate highway system is, without doubt, socialist. And there is nothing wrong with that. It is perfectly acceptable to mix socialism with capitalism. In fact, there are many privately owned, for-profit, fully 100% capitalist businesses in the U.S. that benefit a great deal from our socialist interstate highway system. They also benefit from our socialist police and fire departments. And many would benefit a great deal from a more socialist approach to health care and education. I am a capitalist. But I recognize that there are some things that are just better and more efficiently done collectively. What the U.S. needs to do is stop listening to the propaganda of the rich, who would like to find a way to put more and more money into their own pockets. Instead, we need a strong but honest conservative party, and a strong but honest liberal party. And we need those parties to work together for the good of the majority of Americans. ",

The reason true socialist and communist systems inevitably become authoritarian hell-holes is because those models try to deny that human beings incorrigibly act out of self-interest (and self-interest does not equal greed). The reason capitalism has worked better than everything else is that it takes self-interest and makes it beneficial to all. It is in my self-interest to produce things that meet your needs in a capitalist system. Third, in a capitalism, individuals and their rights matter. In a communist state they don\u2019t. It\u2019s only the state that matters, and individuals are there to serve the state. ",

            "answer_text": "The foundation of all natural rights is first and foremost the right of self ownership. This means nobody can enslave you, control your thoughts or how you express them and to hold any belief system one wishes and to exercise freely all the benefits the right of self ownership confer. Stemming from the foundational right, the right to maintain and improve one's condition and subsequently to own property to use and dispose of as one sees fit must follow. Barring intrusion upon the rights of another, the individual is sovereign and inalienable from the afore mentioned rights. This is the freedom we all seek but only a few fully enjoy. The more the freedom of the individual is protected the better society as a whole performs. Most Western civilizations have embraced this concept and have been the most successful in all the world in producing goods and services that better people's lives, improve their general condition and reduce poverty. The general term for this is the Free Market. Capitalism is only a facet of the market but it has produced much of the success in creating wealth at all levels. In opposition and often direct conflict with free market societies both socialism and communism with all the variants of them have never achieved success. Government alone holds the monopoly on force and coercesion. It is also true that slavery can only exist when it is condoned by government and theft can be made legal by the wording of law. When elites decide for themselves that they see a better way for the general conduct of society they must enlist the support of government to impose these ideas on the people. It is easy to demonize the successful when the majority are not as capable of creating the wealth and prosperity that the ambitious and fortunate few have done. Envy and greed are used to justify preying upon the wealthy and those with less will support the idea that the successful owe them something more. It seems all too easy to win popular support for the idea that one can have more when no effort is required other than that one votes for it. Government with popular support from the people can then expand authority and control of more of the population. Taking from those that produce by threat of force is theft. Taking the fruits of one's labor for the benefit of another enslaved the laborer. Creating dependency on government for one's sustenance also creates a slave. Good government must protect the rights of the sovereign individual. This is freedom. Poor government exploits the people by infringing upon their rights and treating them as a collective to be controlled in every aspect of their lives. This is slavery. As a spectrum between freedom and slavery fall various forms of government. With freedom on the right and slavery on the left it is the Free Market that defines the right side of things and is where the most prosperous societies fall. These are the societies that people flee to. Socialism and communism represent the left side of the spectrum and those societies that lean in that direction have always been the least prosperous and most restricted. These societies are the ones that build walls to keep their people from fleeing. For myself the choice is clear, it will always be freedom. ",

The reason for this is that I am disgusted with capitalism. I am a geographer and have studied international relations as part of my political science degree, I spend so many hours looking at all the things which makes western capitalism possible. I do not want to support a society, which sustains itself by exploiting people around the world. A lot of people think that capitalism helps people not be poor, but this is not the case, the wealth of the western world is build on slavery and poverty in other places. If resources were not stolen from the third world, the prices of goods in the west would not be possible. Every year working class westerners are treated worse, wages are going down, we invade other countries and murder people, in order to sustain our unsustainable society. We are focused on consumerism, selfishness, and competition with our friends and neighbors, most people are unhappy with their jobs, and think their life has little meaning. I don\u2019t have the answers to all problems, and I don\u2019t think communism is the answer to all problems either, but this society is immoral, and I would prefer to build a better one, though I am always open to suggestions on what a good society is, communism is just the best offer I have heard so far.

You are not a communist, a socialist or a capitalist. Your are not Adam Smith or Karl Marx. You are a follower, and you cant be a capitalist if you blindly follow, and you cant be a socialist or communist either, if you blindly follow. In ALL of these systems, you have to be the master of the system, not its slave. YOU have to take responsibility of your country.

Communism and socialism require force, capitalism is not a system. It is an economic condition which emerges from voluntary, unforced transactions, dealings and trade. Under capitalism, good or bad results can be created; free choices are always available to change outcomes. Communism and socialism distort voluntary exchange, imposing an artificial system which contradicts human nature thus fails. How fast depends on how much contradiction occurs. ",

Anybody could claim that he/she is a communist, while me, opposing them, cannot claim to be a capitalist, since I don't have capital. The fundamental opposition observed by Marx was actually between communism and private property. And the system which today's communists oppose is free-market. And this gives you the theoretical nature of the opposition, which is not actually that interesting for real-economy discussions. ",
