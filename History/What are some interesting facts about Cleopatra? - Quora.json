            "answer_text": "Cleopatra ( Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator ) Daughter of King Ptolemy XII Auletes, Cleopatra was destined to become the last queen of the Macedonian dynasty that ruled Egypt between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE and its annexation by Rome in 30 BCE. The line had been founded by Alexander\u2019s general Ptolemy, who became King Ptolemy I Soter of Egypt. Cleopatra was of Macedonian descent and had little, if any, Egyptian blood, although she alone of her house took the trouble to learn Egyptian and, for political reasons, styled herself as the new Isis, a title that distinguished her from the earlier Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra III, who had also claimed to be the living embodiment of the goddess Isis. When Ptolemy XII died in 51 BCE, the throne passed to his young son, Ptolemy XIII, and daughter, Cleopatra VII. It is likely, but not proven, that the two married soon after their father\u2019s death. The 18-year-old Cleopatra, older than her brother by about eight years, became the dominant ruler. Evidence shows that the first decree in which Ptolemy\u2019s name precedes Cleopatra\u2019s was in October of 50 BCE. Soon after, Cleopatra was forced to flee Egypt for Syria, where she raised an army and in 48 BCE returned to face her brother at Pelusium, on Egypt\u2019s eastern border. The murder of the Roman general Pompey, who had sought refuge from Ptolemy XIII at Pelusium, and the arrival of Julius Caesar brought temporary peace.  Cleopatra realized that she needed Roman support, or, more specifically, Caesar\u2019s support, if she was to regain her throne. Each was determined to use the other. Caesar sought money for repayment of the debts incurred by Cleopatra\u2019s father, Auletes, as he struggled to retain his throne. Cleopatra was determined to keep her throne and, if possible, to restore the glories of the first Ptolemies and recover as much as possible of their dominions, which had included southern Syria and Palestine. Caesar and Cleopatra became lovers and spent the winter besieged in Alexandria. Roman reinforcements arrived the following spring, and Ptolemy XIII fled and drowned in the Nile. Cleopatra, now married to her brother Ptolemy XIV, was restored to her throne. In June 47 BCE she gave birth to Ptolemy Caesar (known to the people of Alexandria as Caesarion, or \u201clittle Caesar\u201d). Whether Caesar was the father of Caesarion, as his name implies, cannot now be known.  It took Caesar two years to extinguish the last flames of Pompeian opposition. As soon as he returned to Rome, in 46 BCE, he celebrated a four-day triumph\u2014the ceremonial in honour of a general after his victory over a foreign enemy\u2014in which Arsinoe, Cleopatra\u2019s younger and hostile sister, was paraded. Cleopatra paid at least one state visit to Rome, accompanied by her husband-brother and son. She was accommodated in Caesar\u2019s private villa beyond the Tiber River and may have been present to witness the dedication of a golden statue of herself in the temple of Venus Genetrix, the ancestress of the Julian family to which Caesar belonged. Cleopatra was in Rome when Caesar was murdered in 44 BCE. Soon after her return to Alexandria, in 44 BCE, Cleopatra\u2019s coruler, Ptolemy XIV, died. Cleopatra now ruled with her infant son, Ptolemy XV Caesar. When, at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BCE, Caesar\u2019s assassins were routed, Mark Antony became the heir apparent of Caesar\u2019s authority\u2014or so it seemed, for Caesar\u2019s great-nephew and personal heir, Octavian, was but a sickly boy. Antony, now controller of Rome\u2019s eastern territories, sent for Cleopatra so that she might explain her role in the aftermath of Caesar\u2019s assassination. She set out for Tarsus in Asia Minor loaded with gifts, having delayed her departure to heighten Antony\u2019s expectation. She entered the city by sailing up the Cydnus River in a barge while dressed in the robes of the new Isis. Antony, who equated himself with the god Dionysus, was captivated. Forgetting his wife, Fulvia, who in Italy was doing her best to maintain her husband\u2019s interests against the growing menace of young Octavian, Antony returned to Alexandria, where he treated Cleopatra not as a \u201cprotected\u201d sovereign but as an independent monarch.  In Alexandria, Cleopatra and Antony formed a society of \u201cinimitable livers\u201d whose members lived what some historians have interpreted as a life of debauchery and folly and others have interpreted as lives dedicated to the cult of the mystical god Dionysus. In 40 BCE Cleopatra gave birth to twins, whom she named Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene. Antony had already left Alexandria to return to Italy, where he was forced to conclude a temporary settlement with Octavian. As part of this settlement, he married Octavian\u2019s sister, Octavia (Fulvia having died). Three years later Antony was convinced that he and Octavian could never come to terms. His marriage to Octavia now an irrelevance, he returned to the east and reunited with Cleopatra. Antony needed Cleopatra\u2019s financial support for his postponed Parthian campaign; in return, Cleopatra requested the return of much of Egypt\u2019s eastern empire, including large portions of Syria and Lebanon and even the rich balsam groves of Jericho.  The Parthian campaign was a costly failure, as was the temporary conquest of Armenia. Nevertheless, in 34 BCE Antony celebrated a triumphal return to Alexandria. This was followed by a celebration known as \u201cthe Donations of Alexandria.\u201d Crowds flocked to the Gymnasium to see Cleopatra and Antony seated on golden thrones on a silver platform with their children sitting on slightly lower thrones beside them. Antony proclaimed Caesarion to be Caesar\u2019s son\u2014thus relegating Octavian, who had been adopted by Caesar as his son and heir, to legal illegitimacy. Cleopatra was hailed as queen of kings, Caesarion as king of kings. Alexander Helios was awarded Armenia and the territory beyond the Euphrates, his infant brother Ptolemy the lands to the west of it. The boys\u2019 sister, Cleopatra Selene, was to be ruler of Cyrene. It was clear to Octavian, watching from Rome, that Antony intended his extended family to rule the civilized world. A propaganda war erupted. Octavian seized Antony\u2019s will (or what he claimed to be Antony\u2019s will) from the temple of the Vestal Virgins, to whom it had been entrusted, and revealed to the Roman people that not only had Antony bestowed Roman possessions on a foreign woman but intended to be buried beside her in Egypt. The rumour quickly spread that Antony also intended to transfer the capital from Rome to Alexandria. Antony and Cleopatra spent the winter of 32\u201331 BCE in Greece. The Roman Senate deprived Antony of his prospective consulate for the following year, and it then declared war against Cleopatra. The naval Battle of Actium, in which Octavian faced the combined forces of Antony and Cleopatra on September 2, 31 BCE, was a disaster for the Egyptians. Antony and Cleopatra fled to Egypt, and Cleopatra retired to her mausoleum as Antony went off to fight his last battle. Receiving the false news that Cleopatra had died, Antony fell on his sword. In a last excess of devotion, he had himself carried to Cleopatra\u2019s retreat and there died, after bidding her to make her peace with Octavian. Cleopatra buried Antony and then committed suicide. The means of her death is uncertain, though Classical writers came to believe that she had killed herself by means of an asp, symbol of divine royalty. She was 39 and had been a queen for 22 years and Antony\u2019s partner for 11. They were buried together, as both of them had wished, and with them was buried the Roman Republic.    I recommend HBO's tv show Rome, 2 seasons and really interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "She was the product of incest:Members of Ptolemic dynasty often married in their own family like cousins or siblings to keep their bloodline pure and it is likely that her parents were brother and sisterShe had a hand in the death of her siblings:Power grabs and murder plots were as much a Ptolemaic tradition as family marriage, and Cleopatra and her brothers and sisters were no different. Her first sibling-husband, Ptolemy XIII, ran her out of Egypt after she tried to take sole possession of the throne, and the pair later faced off in a civil war. Cleopatra regained the upper hand by teaming with Julius Caesar, and Ptolemy drowned in the Nile River after being defeated in battle. Following the war, Cleopatra remarried to her younger brother Ptolemy XIV, but she is believed to have had him murdered in a bid to make her son her co-ruler. In 41 B.C., she also engineered the execution of her sister, Arsinoe, who she considered a rival to throne.She had a son with Caesar:Cleopatra was 21 years old when they met and Caesar was 52; they became lovers during Caesar\u2019s stay in Egypt between 48 BC and 47 BC. Cleopatra claimed that Caesar was the father of her son and wished him to name the boy his heir; but Caesar refused, choosing his grandnephew Octavian instead.Cleopatra, Ptolemy XIV, and Caesarion (Cleopatra and Caesar\u2019s son) visited Rome in mid-46 BC. The Egyptian queen resided in one of Caesar's country houses just outside of Rome.They returned to Egypt in 44 B.C.E after the assassination of Caesar.After returning to Egypt, Cleopatra allegedly poisoned Ptolemy XIV and made Caesarion her co-regent and made him the successor.She was living in Rome at the time of Caesar\u2019s assassination:Cleopatra joined Julius Caesar in Rome beginning in 46 B.C., and her presence seems to have caused quite a stir. Caesar didn\u2019t hide that she was his mistress\u2014she even came to the city with their lovechild, Caesarion, in tow\u2014and many Romans were scandalized when he erected a gilded statue of her in the temple of Venus Genetrix. Cleopatra was forced to flee Rome after Caesar was stabbed to death in the Roman senate in 44 B.C., but by then she had made her mark on the city. Her exotic hairstyle and pearl jewelry became a fashion trend, and according to the historian Joann Fletcher, \u201cso many Roman women adopted the \u2018Cleopatra look\u2019 that their statuary has often been mistaken for Cleopatra herself.\u201dShe led a fleet in naval battle:Cleopatra and Mark Antony fell in love, eventually got married and Cleopatra had three sons with him, but their relationship also spawned a massive scandal in Rome.Antony\u2019s rival Octavian used propaganda to portray him as a traitor under the sway of a scheming seductress, and in 32 B.C., the Roman Senate declared war on Cleopatra.The conflict reached its climax the following year in a famous naval battle at Actium. Cleopatra personally led several dozen Egyptian warships into the fray alongside Antony\u2019s fleet, but they were no match for Octavian\u2019s navy. The battle soon devolved into a rout, and Cleopatra and Antony were forced to break through the Roman line and flee to Egypt. ",
