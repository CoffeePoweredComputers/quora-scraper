            "answer_text": "I think one of the best ways to think about this would be time-travel debate\u2014this allows you to take up something historical. The other is to have big value debates (or even policy debate) but with a mind to historical arguments. Here are a couple probably decent ones: The Vietnam WarWorld War IIUse of the atomic bombSpace exploration.I judged a debate in history of Russia, when the political parties debated key topics. I think it was communism, anarchy, and maybe some different versions of communism. Very intricate historically situated debate.You can look at Great Speeches of the Day (they often have relevant topics.You can search Congressional TestimonyYou can search the Congressional summaries on key topics (I forget what these are called). They might be called backgrounders.For current topics, the Opinion pages can help. Obviously sometimes there is a debate in the headlines, but I think the opinion pages are probably a better place to start.",
