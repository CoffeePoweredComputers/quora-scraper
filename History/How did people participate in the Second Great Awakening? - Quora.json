            "answer_text": "On the day of Armageddon(called Qaiyamat in Arabic), there shall be a ist call(Soor as in arabic) from Hazrat Israfeel(AS) and earth will be flattened and all other objects will be destroyed. On second call all living will die including Prophet of Angeles Hazrat Jibreel(AS). Only a few mighty Angeles will survive to carry the throne(called Arsh-a-Moal\u2019la in Arabic) of Allah(SWT). On the third call all will be reawakened that shall be the day of Judgement. All be given new bodies and there would be a chaos and fear and everywhere a tipsy turvy situation. No one will be recognizing the other not even their parents. All be rushing towards the Creator (Master of Youm-a-deen)to hear the final verdict. It shall be the most horrible and difficult process to pass through. This shall be the day of triumph for pious one holding a folder of noble deeds in their right hands to go to heavens and for the others to go to hell. ",
