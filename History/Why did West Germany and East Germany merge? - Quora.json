            "answer_text": "First of all, they did not merge. Technically the DDR (East Germany) decided to terminate itself as a state and to join the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany). Of course this step was no surprise, it was the result of thorough negotiations and several treaties. The former East German regime had collapsed in late November 1989, the official reunion took place October 3rd., 1990 And the second thing: Both parts of Germany reunited, because they were divided before. After WW 2, the four allied forces (USA, Soviet Union, France, UK) occupied Germany and divided it into four occupation zones. In 1945 they had agreed to rule over Germany together and to leave Germany undivided. But soon differences appeared between the Soviet Union and the three Western allied forces, and the SU decided to separate their zone from the other three zones. Later the three Western zones were united and became the Frderal Republic of Germany, a democratic and liberal country. It was founded in 1949, was given back limited sovereignity in 1955, became member of the NATO in 1956 and was founding member of the European Community in 1957. The Western allies ran military bases in Western Germany, apart from that Western Germany was a free country. Eastern Germany took a different path: The Soviet Union formed a socialist state out of them and installed a communist puppet regime. The German Democratic Republic was imposed in 1948, it became member of the Warshaw Pact and the Counsil of Mutual Economic Aid (the economic community of the Soviet Union and its satellite states). However, the German Democratic Republic was not free. Their elections were rigged, their citizens were not free to travel, their currency was not convertible - and West Germany did not recognize them as a souvereign country. The main thing which made the reunition possible was the simple fact that socialism does not work. If you want to have a country which prospers, socialism does not work. So, while West Germany became one of the most successful industrialized country on earth, East Germany fell back in poverty. It is really hard to imagine, but just think about a West German supermarket in the 1980's. You walk in and want to buy a bottle of shampoo. You will find at least six different brands, and probably three different flavors for each brand. And then you walk into an East German supermarket - and they probably are sold out of shampoo completely. It is very likely that they also are sold out of coffee. Or bananas. In 1985, Michael Gorbachev became leader of the Soviet Union - and soon found out that the SU was totally broke. In 1987 he told the leaders of his satellite states that the SU would not be able anymore to support them. He gave them the right to make up their own political decisions. Without the support of the SU, the puppet regimes became unstable and collapsed all. Each East European satellite state (East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungaria, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and a few others) overthrew their communist puppet regime and chose a new democratic one. All these countries wanted to become independent from the SU - but only East Germany wanted to reunite with West Germany. And West Germany wanted to reunite with East Germany. Because we are one people. ",

            "answer_text": "East Germans were undecided as to how to control the growing number of protestors and afraid the non-violent situation would unravel and turn violent, thus giving the hard-core boys all the excuses in the world to \u201cbring some order\u201d to an otherwise very unpromising situation for the DDR, and not just in parts of East Berlin. Don\u2019t forget the large peaceful, or mostly peaceful crowds, in Leipzig and they were ready to take matters into their hands a lot quicker. At the last minute, a prominent DDR pol did something very un-Communist. He showed more commonsense than party loyalty and in a quick reflex motion, he picked up the phone and told the VoPos at the Bornholm railroad bridge to open the flood gates and the waters of frustrated freedom-seeking East Germans entered West Berlin and the rest of the old Ossie regime fell piece by piece. Honecker was booted, tried and found guilty and I believe his nasty frau was picked up as well. Served \u2019em right. More so than Walter Ulbricht, even Nikita Kruschev, Honecker was the \u201cbrains\u201d and muscle behind the construction of the Berlin Wall. (Trump should take heed.) I visited East Berlin twice on US-EGerman arranged tours for military dependents, once in \u201963 with my two older brothers and Mother. (My Dad had to go on a separate tour and in uniform. The year later I returned with my local Boy Scouts troop from Wiesbaden.) Yeah, I\u2019ll never forget the hospitality shown by the Vopos and Stasi for my brother after the hand-picked Ossie \u201ctour guide\u201d screwed up my late-and eldest brother Shaun, for supposedly bringing in too many West German Marks because he fumbled the currency punctuation thus making Shaun, who just graduated from h.s., looking like Herr Moneybags and this caused us to sit in that damn bus for almost an hour in mid-June of 63, just behind Kennedy\u2019s famous \u201cIch bin ein Berliner\u201d visit. A quicker use of a phone could\u2019ve straightened out my brother\u2019s situation if they tried to reach the other tour, even back in \u201863. But a quick use of a phone to let the really oppressed masses walk into free West Berlin on Nov. 9th, 1989 was all it took to bring down two of the most dismal governments in the history of man: the DDR and the USSR (the year later.) LOL, wiedersehn Kamaraden. Raust! ",
