            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a parallel between this decade and the one a hundred years ago. The 1920s were called \u201cThe Roaring Twenties\u201d for as long as I can remember, which is about 65 years ago. Why? The decade of the 1920s roared with social change, prosperity, relief at the end of the War To End All Wars (WWI, which didn\u2019t, sadly), Women stopped dragging around 20 lbs of Iron Maidens (medieval torture devices, updated to corsets) and highly flammable material, and showed their legs. Young people went out and did lewd dances in public (not really, but it seemed so at the time). Music went from acceptable popular parlor songs and classical favorites to something wild and uninhibited \u2014 Jazz. The automobile and movies and aviation came into the cultural landscape and became immutable parts of it, contributing to a sense of the world moving ever faster and connecting society in ways once considered impossible. In other words: the 1920s were all about breaking with tradition. Some people think that the 2020s will as well, in its own way, as the Boomers phase out and the newer generations exercise their power to vote and run for office. People will continue to move over the globe by the millions and billions. In the USA, there\u2019s an epic battle between the past as embodied by the Republicans, and the younger Democrats (those in age, those in spirit) who want real transformation and reform. A lot of boundaries and definitions are dissolving. Terms people in my generation were taught to hate and fear don\u2019t mean the same to Millennials \u2014 nor should they, because now the world changes at exponentially-rising speed. TL/DR: \u201cThe New Roaring Twenties\u201d is a grabby headline and a commentary that\u2019s fairly easy to write. :-) ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy am I hearing this time being called 'The Roaring Twenties\u2019?\u201d Are you asking why the 1920s were called that? A quick history lesson \u2026 In the later 19th century the so-called Second Industrial Revolution took off with new petroleum-powered technologies being invented. Petroleum exploration soon became big business. But valuable as petroleum was, production was limited and the supply was unreliable. Fast-forward to 1901. A Croatian engineer named Anthony Lucas made a massive discovery at Spindletop well in Texas. It was the most petroleum find ever discovered at the time. It lead to many other large discoveries in Texas and other parts of the U.S. The U.S. was soon the largest oil producer in the world and petroleum soon became plentiful and inexpensive. By the 1920s cheap oil had driven the U.S. economy into overdrive and boosted other parts of the world as well. The U.S. economy reached heights it had never seen before. What made things even more interesting is that the U.S. was culturally in the midst of a reformation because of the Progressive movement. Gambling, alcohol, and other perceived ills that had been prevalent in the 19th century were being actively repressed by law. The result was a massive backlash with widespread and flagrant violation of the laws (meaning lots of gambling and drinking venues operating with open disregard for the law). The result was an unintended culture of permissiveness in the urban areas of the U.S. The unfortunate result of the U.S.\u2019s inexperience with so much undisciplined success was a massive economic collapse known as the Great Depression.
