            "answer_text": "They returned home and were gradually reintegrated into Japanese and Italian society. In the case of Japan, there were around two million Japanese soldiers and sailors serving outside Japan. It took two years for the majority to be repatriated. The Soviets held some Japanese prisoners of war for ten years. In Japan the occupation government placed restrictions on what types of work former Japanese military personnel could perform. It was very restrictive for former officers. Since the Japanese economy was in shambles, finding any kind of a job was difficult and may ex soldiers were reduced to begging. ",

            "answer_text": "The ex-Axis servicemen & women got pensions from their governments. Except for the SS. Eventually those who were drafted into the SS were awarded pensions. Gestapo men who were cops before the war got pensions for the time they served prior. The end of WW2 is really baffling. Like in the Philippines. Manila was the second-most destroyed city after Warsaw. Yet we only got $5 million from the Marshall Plan. Yugoslavia got $300 million & they used it finance Greek communists in their civil war. Poland & Czechoslovakia were Allied countries yet they found themselves behind the Iron Curtain. Stalin told his communist stooges to refuse the Marshall Plan & not join Bretton Woods OR ELSE. ",
