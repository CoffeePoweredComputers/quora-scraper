If his name is John Smith, she should call him \u201cMr. Smith.\u201dIf he is a doctor, she should call him \u201cDr. Smith\u201d or \u201cthe doctor.\u201dIf he is a colonel, she should call him \u201cColonel Smith\u201d or \u201cthe colonel.\u201d\u201cThe elegant way is to call the absent party by their name; ask Mr. Smith how Mrs. Smith is, or enquire of Mrs. Jones for Mr. Jones, but never for \"your husband\" or \"your wife.\" On the other hand, if you are married, never speak of your husband as your \"lord,\" \"husband,\" or \"good man,\" avoid, also, unless amongst relatives, calling him by his Christian name. If you wish others to respect him, show by speaking of him in respectful terms that you do so yourself. If either your own husband or your friend's is in the army or navy, or can claim the Dr., Prof., or any other prefix to his name, there is no impropriety in speaking of him as the colonel, doctor, or whatever his title may be.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Susanna Moodie, born in 1803 in England, later went to Canada with her husband, and she wrote a famous book about it. Roughing it in the Bush - Wikipedia. They were from a middle-class background and they had high hopes of \u201cmaking their fortune\u201d in Canada from the free land grant that was offered to immigrants. Throughout the book she refers to him as \u201cMoodie\u201d. I was perfectly bewildered\u2014I could only stare at the place, with my eyes swimming in tears; but, as the horses plunged down into the broken hollow, my attention was drawn from my new residence to the perils which endangered life and limb at every step. The driver, however, was well used to such roads, and, steering us dexterously between the black stumps, at length drove up, not to the door, for there was none to the house, but to the open space from which that absent, but very necessary, appendage had been removed. Three young steers and two heifers, which the driver proceeded to drive out, were quietly reposing upon the floor. A few strokes of his whip, and a loud burst of gratuitous curses, soon effected an ejectment; and I dismounted, and took possession of this untenable tenement. Moodie was not yet in sight with the teams. I begged the man to stay until he arrived, as I felt terrified at being left alone in this wild, strange-looking place. He laughed, as well he might, at our fears, and said he had a long way to go, and must be off; then, cracking his whip, and nodding to the girl, who was crying aloud, he went his way, and Hannah and myself were left standing in the middle of the dirty floor. Roughing it in the Bush, by Susanna Moodie  Victoria ascended to the throne in 1837; while Susanna Moodie\u2019s husband served in the militia against William Lyon Mackenzie in the Upper Canada Rebellion in the same year.
