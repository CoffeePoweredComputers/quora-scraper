            "answer_text": "Q: What are some little known facts about Boston? If you\u2019re younger than 40, it\u2019s possible you\u2019ve never heard of Boston\u2019s infamous Combat Zone, the area designated as its red light district. In the 60s through the early 80s, it was Boston\u2019s equivalent of New York\u2019s Times Square. I will never forget our first drive up Washington Street when I was all of 12-years-old past the strip joints and movie houses, seeing what was probably a prostitute walking up the street with a skirt so short, you could just make out her pubic hairs. My head was pressed to the car window with such force, I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t break through it. People may tell you that it\u2019s still legal to bring your cow to graze in Boston Common, but it\u2019s not true. Hey, There's a Cow on the Boston Common The Lagoon Bridge over the pond in Boston Garden was once the world\u2019s shortest suspension bridge. Today, it is supported by girders. The Hancock Tower had a very troubled beginning. Upon the completion of its construction, windows started popping out of the building, crashing to the ground below. If you visited the city in the early 1970s, you would have seen a glass-and-steel skyscraper that looked more like a glass-plywood-and-steel skyscraper. At 50 stories, they called it the \u201cPlywood Skyscraper.\u201d It was discovered that the original design (by I.M. Pei) had window encasements could not properly withstand the stresses of the building as it swayed in the wind. For a while, the builders stationed observers outside the building to watch for a sudden change in the reflection of the glass, which indicated it was about to pop out. Fortunately, no one was hurt.  The old Boston Garden was known for many things, but my favorite was its lack of air conditioning. This meant that whenever the Boston Bruins made it to the playoffs in the late spring months, they teams often had to skate in a fog rising from the ice they could barely keep frozen. It\u2019s incredible to think about this today, but in the mid-1980s, when the city had finally entered its period of revival, you could still park all day in the open lots on Fan Pier for a mere $4. Today, $4 won\u2019t buy you 15 minutes in any downtown garage. Fenway Park used to have a bowling alley, Fenway Bowl. The entrance was on the corner of Lansdale and Brookline Avenue. According to Oliver Jensen in his book History of Railroads of America, a Springfield railroad entrepreneur named Chester Chapin tried to present a proposal to buy a little railroad called the New York Central to Boston banking interests in the years before the Civil War. He failed, of course, but it sets up a wondrous \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario. That railroad would later be purchased by Cornelius Vanderbilt, which combined with the Erie Canal, would make New York the world\u2019s center of commerce that it is today. One can only imagine how Boston\u2019s fortunes might have changed had Boston\u2019s Brahmins had more vision and less elitism. ",
