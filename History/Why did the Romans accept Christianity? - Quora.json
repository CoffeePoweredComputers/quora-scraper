            "answer_text": "This answer was incorrectly merged into another question, but Quora\u2019s demerge system seems broken. For all the links, see Martin Turner's answer to How did Constantine become the first Christian emperor? The Christian population had been steadily rising in the empire since the first century. One estimate (I\u2019ve no idea how it was made, or how valid) suggested 10% of the population[1] of the Empire were Christian by the Edict of Milan.[2] For a summary of the road to Milan, read this remarkable published essay[3] by a young historian. According to Rodney Stark, the Christian population rose from 40,000 in AD 150, to 218,000 in 200, to 1.17 million by 250.[4] If the 10% in AD 300 figure is correct, this means that the Christian population must have more than doubled again by 300, even taking the lowest estimate for the population of the empire. A great resource for learning about the context is Religions of the Constantinian Empire, by Mark Wood. Because we don\u2019t have records of sociologists conducting widespread surveys during the period, we cannot actually know what drove people towards Christianity. However, here are some ideas which have been considered plausible over the last period: The persecuting emperors unwittingly aided the church. It has often been said \u2018the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church\u2019 (Tertullian[5]). This was not simply because persecution develops commitment. By so aggressively persecuting Christians, emperors such as Diocletian: Incited sympathy among non-believers Removed from the church those who were less committed Created a \u2018me or them\u2019 mindset. The emperor claimed to be a god. However, all the emperors subsequently died. Even without Christians doing anything, their mortality proved the persecuting emperors wrong. Christianity was highly egalitarian. By comparison with paganism, Christianity welcomed and valued women, non-Romans, non-Greeks, slaves and social outcasts, and treated them all equally. Whether or not Italic, wealthy, patrician, male Romans thought this was a good thing, if you were of any of these categories, Christianity was substantially more welcoming to you than other religions. The empire was in a mess. Mark Edwards\u2019 book is particularly strong on the difficulties of getting people to stand for public office. This was widely attributed to effetism and licentiousness. Christianity represented a moral system which chimed with the that of the glory days of Augustus, rather than the apathetic present. Christians invested themselves in making their case to pagans. We have numerous records of Christian apologia to Pagans, and virtually none of pagan interest in making the case in the other direction to Christians. Christians took the time and effort to understand the way pagans thought (and many of them had been pagan until a few years before writing), whereas Romans (for example Pliny, in Letter X:96) were dismissive of Christianity, and did not bother to investigate what it was saying. Christianity chimed with Stoicism. The dominant philosophy in the Roman empire from Seneca onwards, and famously championed by the philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius, was Stoicism. Even in Seneca we see significant sympathy for philosophical positions which chimed with Christianity (although Seneca never mentions the new religion as such), including the idea of a single God, and the importance of self-control. Notably, no pagan religion was perceived to be so close to Stoicism. Roman paganism was linked to conquest. The degree to which the Romans had co-opted pagan beliefs in pushing the Empire outwards is often underestimated. Furthermore, the principal role of pagan activity was not linked to belief (See Gray: Seven Types of Atheism[6]) but to practice, and the main aim of that practice was obtaining favour from the gods. A series of plagues had rendered imperial populations vulnerable, which in turn meant that the empire became subject to invasion from outside. Pagan sacrifices did not produce the result claimed for them. Christianity, which had grown up under persecution, had a developed philosophy for accounting for evil and suffering in the world, and for responding to the privations of military defeat. Christianity explained. Probably the most important, if we look at the various apologia, was that Christianity explained what was happening in the world. It is not so much that it explained it better: neither pagan religion (aside from the existence of primordial forces) nor Stoic philosophy explained at all. Stoicism recommended a way to live in the face of the inexplicable. In a world without other answers, the Christian answers gained increasing traction. Christians were perceived as admirable. Christian conduct in the face of persecution satisfied the high ideals of Stoicism, and also the old ideals of the Empire. It is not just that Christians recommended these values: they were perceived by many to be consistent in their application of them.

            "answer_text": "In the beginning Christianity was simply another sect of Judaism/Hebraic Monotheism. There were the Samaritans who weren't deported by the Babylonians & the Romans. There were the Sadducees who were the conservative upper class, who were active in Temple Judaism. The Pharisees who would later become Rabinnic Judaism. The Essenes who practiced celibacy. John the Baptist may have been influenced by them, but he was a one man movement. The fanatical Zealots who got everybody deported out of Judea & scattered all over the empire. Thanks guys. But it was Paul aka Saul of Tarsus who spread it to the Greeks, Romans & Arabs. He met with James the brother/ beloved of Jesus. He stipulated that the Greek & Romans don't need to be circumcised. But everybody else should NOT eat blood, bloody meat, meat from a strangled animal & fornicate, shtupping in Yiddish. Christianity spread among the slaves & the lower class. What appealed to them was that people who suffer now will enjoy eternal life in heaven. In fact this was still beaten into my head in Catholic school. God, my second grade teacher was a b***h. So among the lower class folk who became a devout Christian was Helena, a humble tavern wench or the innkeeper's daughter who caught the eye of an up & coming warlord named Constantius. Their son Constantine became sole emperor of Rome. He simply legalized Christianity in the 313 Edict of Milan. And he made Trinitarian Christianity the official ideology instead of the teachings of Arius of Alexandria at the Council of Nicaea in 325. Constantine wanted to break from Rome's pagan past. So in 330 he made Byzantion the new capital, Nova Roma. He upgraded the defenses. Later it would have triple walls. He invited all prominent Roman Senators, Patricians, Knights, who had been converted by their slaves, to move there as a safe haven. They also took their money with them. But what really ruined paganism was Theodosius\u2019 Edict of Thessalonika in 380. The Goths decimated the Roman Legions and killed the Arian Christian Emperor Valens at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. The new boss Ted needed to raise another army. So the law which banned paganism enabled him to confiscate the gold, silver and precious gems from pagan temples all over the empire. He disbanded the Vestal Virgins because they money in trust. He looted the Temple of Juno Monetas on Capitoline Hill because it was also the mint. So there you have it, a crucified Jewish preacher, a tent maker from Tarsus, a tavern wench who satisfied a young military officer\u2019s booty call, and an Emperor who needed to raise another army.
