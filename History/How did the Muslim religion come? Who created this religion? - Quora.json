            "answer_text": "Muslims believe that the first person on this earth, Adam, was the first Muslim. They also believe that this earth was never devoid of a \u2018Divine Guide\u2019 (Nabi / Prophet) from God to guide the mankind. The Islam that you see today is the evolved version of \u2018first Islam\u2019 of \u2018Adam\u2019. Every few years (decades / centuries) it got mixed with customs and cultures of other religions and societies and thus got corrupted. So, God renewed it by sending new Prophets in every era. The last of these prophets was Mohammed who left this world some 1400 years ago. Sunni Muslims believe that he appointed no successor after him and Shia Muslims believe that he appointed Ali (his cousin and son-in-law and) to succeed him on God\u2019s command, thus providing divine guidance even after the demise of Mohammed. So, Muslims believe that the creator of this religion is Allah and He has \u2018created\u2019 only one religion and that is Islam. Surah Ali 'Imran [3:19] ",
