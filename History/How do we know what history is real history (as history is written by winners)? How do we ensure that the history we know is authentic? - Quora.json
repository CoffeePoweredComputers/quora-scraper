            "answer_text": "The idea that \"history is written by the winners\" is a clich\u00e9d truism that isn't actually very true. History is actually written by academics trained in a careful scholarly method and working within a system of peer review, both of which serve to discard unlikely or obviously biased interpretations.  It works toward an argument to the best explanation - ie one that explains as much of the evidence as possible and which is agreed is the most likely version of what happened in the past. The Historical Method is based on three fundamental steps, each of which has its own techniques: 1. Heuristic- This is the identification of relevant material to use as sources of information.  These can range from the obvious, such as a historian of the time's account of events he witnessed personally, to the much less obvious, like a medieval manor's account book detailing purchases for the estate. Everything from archaeological finds to coins to heraldry can be relevant here.  The key word here is \"relevant\", and there is a high degree of skill in working out which sources of information are pertinent to the subject in question. 2. Criticism- This is the process of appraisal of the source material in the light of the question being answered or subject being examined.  It involves such things as determining the level of \"authenticity\" of a source (Is it what is seems to be?), its \"integrity\" (Can its account be trusted?  What are its biases?), its context (What genre is it?  Is it responding or reacting to another source?  Is it using literary tropes that need to be treated with scepticism?)  Material evidence, such as archaeology, architecture, art , coins etc needs to be firmly put into context to be understood.  Documentary sources also need careful contextualisation - the social conditions of their production, their polemical intent (if any), their reason for production (more important for a political speech than a birth certificate, for example) , their intended audience and the background and biases of their writer (if known) all have to be taken into account. 3.  Synthesis and Exposition - This is the formal statement of the findings from steps 1 and 2, which each finding supported by reference to the relevant evidence.  The key difference between this method and those used in the hard sciences is that the researcher lays all this material, its analysis and his conclusions out systematically, but the conclusions are a subjective assessment of likelihood rather than an objective statement of probabilistic induction.  This subjectivity is what many trained in the sciences find alien about history and lead them to reject history as insubstantial.  But the key thing to understand here is that the historian is not working toward an absolute statement about what definitely happened in the past, since that is generally impossible except on incidental points nof fact (eg there is no doubt that Adolf HItler was born on April 20 1889).  A historian instead works to present \"the argument to the best explanation\".  In other words, the argument that best accounts for the largest amount of relevant evidence. This means that there is never a definitive version of history - the best historians can come to is a general consensus as to what the argument to the best explanation may be.  It also means that any consensus is always being re-examined and potentially revised by the next generation of young historians.  And that new types of information get added to the heuristic (eg blogs, social media records) and new perspectives change the criticism stage (feminism, post-structuralism).  So our understanding of the past can never become a fixed orthodoxy. The popular perception of the past is substantially determined by the way these carefully analysed perspective on history filter down into popular culture.  Historians and students of their work can and do write popularisations or help produce documentaries which can help to achieve this.  But other elements can make popular perception resistant to  this influence.  The prejudice of many people against religion has meant that the Nineteenth Century idea that religion has always been an enemy of science is still a very strong element in popular culture, despite the fact actual historians of science rejected this \"Conflict Thesis\" almost a century ago.   And very popular novels or movies can reinforce ideas about the past which have no academic support.  Thanks to Braveheart, generations of people are convinced medieval Scots wore kilts and blue war paint (they wore neither).  Thanks to Washington Irving's novel A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus (1828) people are still convinced the medieval Church taught that the earth was flat.  Academic history has a major influence on how we see the past, but it's not the sole determinant. But only people who are very naive and have no understanding of history as an academic discipline think history is simply a matter of taking sources from the time at face value.  Historians do precisely the opposite of this - they analyse source material with extreme scepticism and use multiple sources and types of material in their heuristic to get the broadest and most objective view of the past possible.

            "answer_text": "History is not a zero-sum game, nor is it absolute. History is a discipline, a study of civilizations and how they've changed over time. There is much interpretation built into any historical analysis and historians struggle with the concept of objectivity in history, but most historians are committed to accuracy and honesty. Victors often do write the histories and for some time they can even control the narrative, but sooner or later professional historians will begin poking holes in their story. Ramesses II plastered Egypt with monuments describing his battle with the Hittites at Kadesh as a great victory, but today most historians of the ancient Near East have a different view. A few points:  Source material: History (the discipline) is based on written records, be they narratives, bank receipts, personal diaries, bureaucratic records or grand proclamations made on monuments. We take anything we can get - but a part of the process of history is evaluating source materials; what they mean, what the authors intended, how truthful were they as well as how accurate they may be for whatever they represent. It's not just the obvious and intentional bias you have to look out for, it's the hidden bias, the below-the-surface bias that you need to understand. Think of historians as traffic cops who have to investigate a car accident centuries after it happened; they have to examine and evaluate (often contradictory) witness testimony, and try to determine in the end what probably happened. And of course historians know they don't have everything, only the evidence that has survived this far. Regardless whether one is studying ancient China or World War II, every historian begins knowing they will only have incomplete information to work with.  Other sources: Historians are increasingly reaching across disciplines for aid in understanding their subject. This means that historians are reaching out to the studies of archaeologists, anthropologists, economists, geologists, botanists, etc. etc. etc. to better understand other evidence that may impact their findings. For instance, for 2,500 years there was a massive flow of human groups - mostly westward, though not exclusively - on the Great (or Russian) Steppe that stretches from China to Eastern Europe, and historians have been able to pinpoint what groups were where in part based on linguistics; based on the root words of some trees and vegetation, linguists, botanists and historians can sometimes - sometimes - say with some confidence that (to create a hypothetical example) x group, which speaks a non-Turkic language, uses a Turkic loan word for y plant, which was only found in these areas on the Steppe at a certain time, and at that time we can place a Turkic-speaking people nearby - meaning that we can believe with some confidence that people x came into contact with the Turkic-speaking group in a certain area within a certain time span. That's a bit abstract, but you get the idea. Another example might be Poland; for a variety of reasons Poland has a mythology of its having been founded in the 9th century. (The first historical record of Poland is from the year 963 CE.) There are elaborate genealogies of the Piast ruling family going back into the mid-9th century but archaeology tells us a different story; archaeologists have found what they believe to be the first evidence of some sort of centralized, organized state in Poland decades later in the 10th century, in the 940s, only twenty-some years before the first mention of Poland in the historical record.  History is process: There's nothing definitive about history. It is an interpretation of evidence, to the best of the historian's ability. It is also continuously being reevaluated. Sometimes we learn more facts - new evidence turns up - but sometimes the known facts are just reinterpreted, looked at in a different way. Sometimes, as time passes, we see trends emerging from historical events that people living closer to them couldn't see yet. Think of those living in the 1650s writing about the recent Treaty of Westphalia of 1648, about how it finally ended the Thirty Years War that had shredded Central Europe to pieces. Only many decades later would astute observers be able to see that something more had changed, that the treaty was some sort of watershed in European state and government history. 150 years later, historians were pointing at the Treaty of Westphalia and talking about the birth of the modern nation-state - while the bloody Catholic-versus-Protestant war the treaty had ended had fallen to secondary importance. We today are just emerging from the shadow of the two World Wars which transformed the world, and most of our focus has been myopically on many of the details of those wars - mostly what our own countries did in them. Some historians however are beginning to see them as a European civil war that destroyed Europe and propelled external powers -  the U.S. and the Soviet Union - to control over the world, and possibly may have prematurely ushered in the end of Western world hegemony, in favor of Asia. (In the finance world, a phrase I've heard often is that we are now in the largest exchange of wealth in human history, and it is flowing decisively West to East.)  Another example might be to think of the great ancient Egyptian civilization, which lasted for 4,000 years before succumbing to Alexander and later, Rome. In that 4,000 years, Egypt was not a steady flow of stability and continuity; governments fell, there were several periods of foreign conquest and rule over Egypt, there were often periods of chaos and anarchy in between dynasties sometimes lasting centuries, the state was continuously reorganized and restructured, borders changed, the language changed over time, etc.  - and yet we look back now and see the basic continuity of a civilization and call it all \"ancient Egypt.\" Perhaps centuries from now, the people then will look back on us and say we today lived in a \"Roman era\" - because we think of the Roman Empire and civilization as having fallen 1,500 years ago, we nonetheless still live in states organized in many ways on Roman principals and with so many Roman traits and cultural motifs, from economy, philosophy and even languages (Think of the immense impact of Latin and its successor languages in Europe) which permeate our modern Western world that to a future world centered (maybe on Asia?) centuries from now, we look like we today are living in the Western world in some sort of Roman-continuum. We don't know how the future peoples will see us, but it will likely be (as we do today when we look backwards through time) in their own terms, with reference to the world they know in their time.   Perspective/ Bias: Einstein once warned that what we study is in part framed and shaped by who is doing the studying. In other words, the very act of studying something in part determines what you see, and therefore influences the outcome. This pretty much destroys any hope that we have of achieving objectivity in history, but it's still important the we press ahead and that we try to be objective. We will fail, but part of the solution to this is that readers of history must do their part to understand the historian who produced a history, the tool that produced the product they are now reading, and try to take that person's likely biases into account. This is an imperfect solution, but it is the best we have. Readers cannot just passively drink in what a historian feeds them; the reader is called upon to engage the historian through their work and understand them as well as the work. An example: Edward Gibbon achieved what all historians dream of but only a select few achieve: he wrote the definitive study on his subject, which is still read centuries after he's gone. His classic work - or at least the abridged version, unless you own all 10 volumes he wrote - The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is in the English-speaking world still the quintessential volume on the subject. Many books about the same subject have been published since and many of those are seen as doing a better job in some respects, but no Classicist will get their degree without reading Gibbon's book. (OK, I admit it, I'm jealous too. ;)) His book shaped so much of what we modern Westerners think about \"the fall of Rome\" but many of his ideas were rooted in his place and times. He wrote his history in the later 18th century in London, and he was the happy subject of a flourishing and prosperous empire that spanned the world and indeed, was on the verge of creating a truly global economy and political structure. To Gibbon, empires were a good thing and represent the highest achievement of humankind, and so his book on the Roman Empire \"falling\" is really a lament - a terrifying description of chaos, disorder and all the bad stuff that happens when empires go away. His book is in many ways a warning to his own generation about the dangers of imperial collapse. (Gibbon was horrified by the American Revolution unfolding while he wrote the book.)  We today in democratic societies however see empires in a different light, and you'll find historians today who doubt that Rome \"fell\" (very dramatic) so much as rusted away to oblivion. Every generation of historians will reassess the work of the previous generation.  There are some more points that can be made about how historians approach their work but the point here is that history is a discipline, a formal way of studying the past, and the danger of the victors in any given era having the last say is minimized so long as professional historians are around. In the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, the Roman Empire destroyed its Phoenician rival, the Carthaginian Empire, and leveled the capital city and heart of that empire - Carthage itself. Nearly all we knew about Carthage for centuries came from Carthage's main enemy, Rome. However, through a mix of disciplines and a better understanding of the spread of the Phoenician peoples and the trade networks they built (through linguistics, archaeology and etc.), we today have a far more sympathetic and fuller understanding of the empire that Rome destroyed. Historians have worked hard to remove the Roman bias from our picture of Carthage. We certainly don't know everything about Carthage - never will - but we have a better understanding of what life was like for Carthaginians, far better than what Carthage's Roman conquerors wanted us to have.

            "answer_text": "It's rather simple. Winners aren't always winners and losers aren't always losers. Even though history is written by winners it's always rewritten by the latter winners. In the end, it's not a zero-sum problem, but rather a value add. Take for example one current event and past event. First the historic event: During the Napoleonic era, France used it's stronghold to strong arm other \"powers\" into supporting it's political moves.  As such, it created economic sanctions against the UK with all sorts of legalese arguments.  The full of Europe turned their back against England, mostly because they were puppet states supporting the Emperor. History, at the time, painted England as the bad guy and Napoleon as the savior... of course...  But key victories by England and successful alliances ended Napoleons rule pretty soon.  History was then rewritten to bash Napoleon. Ironically, neither the restored burbons, nor the July Monarchy nor the Second French Republic were strong enough to survive. Napoleon III disolved the 2nd Republic, rewrote history and started the Second Empire. He too would fall after the Mexican fiasco and the decisive Battle of Sedan. Thus after the fall of the \"farce\" (as Marx called the second attempt by the Bonapartists) history was rewritten again by the victorious Third Republic. Now the current event: Edward Snowden whistle-blows, fleds the US, and then seeks asylum first in China, then to Latin America and now to Russia. All U.S. \"allies\" (which after this scandal, some people will consider puppets) unite to bring this man to \"justice\" and even Evo Morales' jet is suspiciously diverted into Vienna suspected on carrying Snowden. History is rewritten by the winners and Snowden is earmarked as a traitor.   What's gonna happen next? Who knows... maybe the current American state will give way to a Third Republic (the first one being that of Washington and Franklin until Kennedy... and the Second One being Clinton...) and we will remember today's Administration as a failed attempt at ending the pseudo empire set by Bush's ascent to power... ...or maybe I'm just using something Heisenberg has cooked.... And that's precisely the point. History does not depend on a single viewpoint (mine for example) but a sum of all. It isn't flawed (as mine could be) since it juxtaposes all available ones and  the final result is just the viewpoint seen from afar. P.S. The example given is just a wild point of view. I don't really feel that way. Just wanted to exaggerated so as to amplify the points of views shown. ",

            "answer_text": "Since 18th Century we have become in a more privileged position as there has been an increasing interest in truth and discovery. Before this time, the historians were not writing about what actually happened, but they were colouring the events in such a way as to flatter the people in power. This was true of many areas of writing and the consensus of these was to create flawed pictures of the past designed to be flattering to those in power. As we have got closer to the modern day, there have been more doubts about the validity of opinions about the past. More and more historians have been revisiting events from the past to look at the evidence and to see whether the portrayed events actually reflect the real events. In answer to your question, I don\u2019t think that we do know what is authentic in history. There are several factors involved in this: People in power are quite good at destroying evidence that shows anything that might be detrimental to their position.Histories written in certain periods will automatically favour the people in power (this is something that is still true today).There is a tendency for people to promote the good side of their ancestors and writers of history are not immune to these influences.Even subconsciously, writers of history live within the time in which they are writing and this will create a bias in any writing.If a historian were to write something that was opposing the opinions of others, no matter how much evidence they used, there was always a tendency to dismiss opinions that disagreed with the perceived truth.People reading histories of the past will be happier to read recounts which match their pre-conceived view of life and events in former times.It\u2019s all very well to talk about the truth and using the evidence, but, at the end of the day, all books are subject to bias and all evidence is open to interpretation.

            "answer_text": "There is vastly more to history than zero-sum-game (winner-take-all) battles. I happen to love military and political history, where potentially that sort of thing happens, but even in those areas there is rarely any clearcut \"winner\" or even issue to \"win\" (though there often is in the minds of the participants and partisan historians). There is also rarely any clear-cut, unambiguous outcome of anything in history. You question/comment is an oversimplification of a very real issue, however, and I think you do a disservice to yourself, and the importance of the issue, by overgeneralizing in that way. I am entirely an amateur at studying history, but I have gotten better at it over the years. The last decade or so I started really paying attention to the bibliographies and actually following up footnotes, and references. I learned *how* to study history (still learning!). There are always controversies - even among experts - and that is often the most interesting part to learn. If you take the time to follow up what the authors are saying and really study something, I think you'll find in the vast majority of cases there is no simple answer to your question.  Just as one example, and easy one:  I've recently gotten very interested in the \"Fall of the Roman Empire\". Just that phrase alone is subject to an enormous debate! I know I have barely scratched the surface, but I have read some great work by Peter Heather,  Adrian Goldsworthy, Bryan Ward-Perkins, Peter Brown, Guy Halsall, and Patricia Southern. I found through them that one of the important secondary sources for all historian of the period is a 3-volume work by AHM Jones \"The Late Roman Empire 284-602\" (Oxford, 1964) which I have only begun to dive into. I'm not confident enough in my knowledge to say that those are the definitive writers you should also read, but I'm confident they are a great start. And among all of them there are different, sometimes very different, theories about what happened, why it happened, how it happened, or even when. A great deal of our knowledge - and the controversies and uncertainty - come from archeology. Many of the authors I have read directly cite each others' works as part of their dissection of the evidence and the arguing for and against evidence, theories, etc. Maybe they all get together and \"settle things\" in a 3 of 5 CoD deathmatch tournament (that would be awesome, lol!) but my experience is that while they may have definite opinions and/or their own take on things, all of them have been very clear about what we have evidence for and what we don't. Why some things are controversial and others less so. Quite often the phrase \"we just don't know enough to be sure if <insert interpretation of the evidence> is correct or not\" which is the plain truth. Remember too, that many of our sources for some time period's history come from contemporaries for whom it was news, not history; or from people writing about it many decades or centuries later who really were trying to write history from the winner's (re: their) own biases. But any historian today worth her salt KNOWS that going in. Anyone who walked into a History Department somewhere preaching Gildas' total and unbiased objectivity of Late Antiquity in early Britain would probably get tarred and feathered (not unreasonably so, IMO, LOL). Okay, enough from me - I happened to  be thinking and reading a lot about these very issues lately. HTH. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually it is indeed a very important pointer that even the historians are very much aware of. In the 19th century and better half of the 20th century, the historians were biased. Try to find any book on history written 50-60 yrs back and compare the facts there with the ones prevalent now a days, you'll be shocked! In the last few decades, the historians have tried to search for ways to create a more impartial method of separating out the facts from the myths. 1. Lets take the example of the crusades, the accounts form that era are either the christian ones or the Muslims ones and needless to say they don't go hand in hand. So what a good historian does is he/she starts looking for the common parts. for e.g. the christian account reads: \"And then Richard the lion heart charged through the gates on his own to meet the humungous Muslim army.\"And now the Muslim account reads:\"The stupid King Richard came running to meet his mighty foe, and suddenly realized he was all alone, since his army was too cowardly to face the light of Islam.\"facts: i) Richard charged alone and ii) The Muslim army was huge in numbers. 2. The people who made these accounts in their time had a different perspective of things and therefore unwittingly give us a very important tool, common sense. Example, It is known that that the roman society relied heavily on slavery. So now when the Romans invade Gaul to eventually enslave the populace and then go ahead to write how the people of Gaul Cheered and welcomed their captors...  not fooling anyone. 3. As time passes the hostility/love the writers may feel about an event starts saturating/neutralizing. For example, when Hitler first came to power, the papers in U.S.A. , U.K. France hailed him as the savior who would fight the evil forces of Communism(which threatened the allies the most) and eventually sail Germany out of the Great Depression. Once he declared war on the allies, they projected him as the mad, overly ambitious, power hungry man who wanted the whole world for himself. Once the war ended(and the atrocities against Jews came to light) the ultra racist side of him emerged. Now, with the coming of a new millennia , people have started to see him as the unfortunate artist who just wanted to use his brush to paint and the world turned him down, subsequently awakening another side to him. And to conclude I would just say something I personally wholeheartedly believe in.. The truth eventually comes out sometimes instantly and sometimes it takes a thousand years.. ",

Some of these answers indicate that history is not \"written by the winners.\" In some ways, that statement is true, but it doesn't apply to a *ton* of the source material. A perfect example is Procopius. Procopius was a historian who wrote during and for the reign of Emperor Justinian in the Eastern Roman Empire. For a thousand years, most of what historians knew of Procopius' opinion on Justinian, his wife, and other leaders of the empire was through the Wars of Justinian and other works. In those writings, he presented an incredibly competent and righteous Emperor Justinian and General Belisarius. In 1623, however, another writing of his was discovered: The Secret History. In it, he describes a fundamentally opposing view of the emperor and the imperial court. He describes Justinian and his wife Theodora as such:  Wherefore to me, and many others of us, these two seemed not to be human beings, but veritable demons, and what the poets call vampires: who laid their heads together to see how they could most easily and quickly destroy the race and deeds of men... It seems clear that he did not make these thoughts public for fear of retribution. How many other first-hand accounts of have been influenced in such a way? How many other Secret Histories were never written or have yet to be discovered? ",

            "answer_text": "What is \"real history\" ? What do you mean by \"history\" ? History might mean a collection of facts about what happened when, to whom, by whom. There is a varying degree of accuracy about such facts, depending on how long ago we're talking about, as well as the number of concurrent sources recording those facts, as well as the diversity of those sources; multiple sources recording recent events have a higher change of being \"real\" than single or doubtful sources about events in the distant past. So much for facts. But history can also mean an explanation of these facts. I.e. not just what happened, but some notion of \"why\" it happened. Here things are less clear. The source recording the fact might provide one narrative, a translation of that source might tack on another, and a modern-day historian might offer his/her own, and ... you might have your own! Clearly there is no sense in which one is more 'real' than another, though you may feel one makes more sense than another. Either way, unlike facts, the value of explanations is not necessarily connected to how long ago it was given, or how many people gave it. So pick your mix of facts and explanation that you want to label \"history\"; the proportion will determine the amount of \"real\"ness you might expect to find in different versions of it. ",

It gave the sun god the strength to not let the god of darkness take over permanently. Then came the Spanish. They saw the aztecs performed human sacrifices, they wrote it down. They also wrote how they killed the Native Americans and how they imposed Christianity. They also wrote how they had slaves, for them, there was nothing wrong with that. . They wrote history as it is. And we can see from reading history, that it\u2019s their point of view. And we can maybe even speculate about the other side\u2019s point of view, although often what people end up doing is projecting. . Then we also have things like archaeology, and we sometimes even test what is in history. And we compare and try come as close to knowing history as we can. And each time new things come up. ",

What is carefully vetted?  Well, there is no simple answer to that.  It sort of depends.  But we know a lot better what isn't carefully vetted.   If something isn't broadly discussed or debated or cared about or written about... it is at least new--and likely is crazy if presented by someone who isn't prestigious in a field.  That doesn't mean average people don't have great ideas--they do.  But great ideas get vetted and reviewed and (sometimes stolen) before being accepted.   If you stick to the histories written by top universities, it is likely you won't be too far wrong.  If you buy into things written by fringe thinkers with a clear agenda--well, you'll vote for Donald Trump. ",

            "answer_text": "\"History is written by the winners\" is definitely true. However, the history pointed here only refer to the authorized history. Most winners intended to leave good reputations for descendants, and they would manipulate historians to write down the history the way they wanted it to be. For example, many emperors who seized the throne by indecent means intended to justify their behaviors by creating illusions that they were chosen by the God. Studying ancient Chinese history, lots of things happened in the same way. When there was a tyrant lived a sumptuous life, and most people could not have a living, those people would start a revolution and took over that tyrant. Since most Chinese people were superstitious, the person who took over the throne always made up some natural signs, for example, his mother saw the sign of a dragon while giving birth, and fooled common people to believe his right to become an emperor and to support him. Nevertheless, now we know the fact that some of history is totally made up because other documents left, though mostly not authorized.  Some people did record the real history and keep it so thousands of years later, we can see the truth. Though, what is the meaning of real history?  The wheel turns and nothing is ever new. ",

Until the 1900's, there literally were not that many books - so books tended to follow the \"accepted\" discourse or since they've been around so long, treated as \"gospel\" - it wasn't until the past 40-5o where books/writer became cheap enough ... Also with much easier travel so writers could explore and reexamine everything - some things refuted now that seem obvious or clues ignored before ... Or of course, with a lot more nuance ... And with something like the internet, now we can access all sides of the story ... So while history is still written by the winners, an entire 100 year war is not reduced to 50 stanzas of a poem ...

If the book lacks footnotes, you're pretty safe to reject it as ideologically-driven myth-making, as in the case of Zinn's modern classic, People's History of the United States. When my son came home from middle school and told me he was reading Zinn and learning about \"biasm,\" which is basically how one myth justifies a contra myth, I realized there's thin hope for kids coming up today to effectively answer your question for themselves.
