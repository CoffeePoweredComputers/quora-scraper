            "answer_text": "There is no \u201cAmerican Empire\u201d, but let\u2019s assume there is and put your question to the test of history. The Mongol Empire in the 13th and 14th centuries AD killed, according to historians, approximately 65.5 million people. Scholars of pre-Columbian Mexico estimate that the Aztec Empire sacrificed up to 250,000 persons a YEAR (!) in religious ceremonies. Just last century, in 1937 and early 1938, the Japanese Empire murdered upwards of 300,000 unarmed, defenseless civilians in the Chinese city of Nanjing (or Nanking), in addition to other inhuman atrocities committed against Asian civilians and Allied combatants covered by the Geneva Conventions. A Soviet historian from Georgia (Stalin\u2019s home country) estimated based on extensive research that Stalin alone was directly responsible for the deaths of 20 million persons in the Soviet Union. The Arab and Ottoman empires spread their religion at the point of the sword forcefully converting people or putting them to death if they did not convert. Germany\u2019s Nazi Third Reich was responsible for a war in Europe that cost the lives of approximately 20 million people on the continent, a number which includes both combatants and defenseless civilians. History is replete with other examples of barbarous and inhuman empires. To compare the United States to these empires is laughable and marks you as an ahistorical ideologue. After defeating two of the empires listed above (Nazi Germany and Japan) the United States returned the conquered territory to its people and helped the countries to recover from the beating that it had inflicted upon them. What other \u201cempire\u201d in the history of the world has done that? After working for 45 years to bring down the Soviet empire, the United States did not exact reprisals or try to humiliate its defeated adversary. Again, the United States offered assistance to Russia and the other former Soviet republics so that they come into the modern, civilized world of nations. Does an evil empire do that to a defeated enemy? Give me a break. ",

            "answer_text": "First America is a republic not an empire . Second as a superpower America has been much better than other superpowers . France dominated half Africa ,England half the world ( 25 per cent in fact ) , Holland and Portugal also had colonies las century .Russia seize all Siberia ,China Tibet Psain had a big empire in America , Austria in Europe and so on .But now let us talk about modern empires and the possible new empires had the axis won the IIWW .Germany ,Japan and Russia dominated other countries physically and commited murder and torture massively .China invaded Tibet and massacrated many tibetans (most pacific people on earth ) . America defeated the Nazis and the Japanese liberating many countries from theses cruel people (helped in this task by the British ).America could have used its superior power to enslave the whole world (the were the first to have the atomic bomb ) .If the Russians had had it first ,they had conquered and enslaved the whole planet .America and Britain defended an protected the world from the very nice communist boys and their even nicer gulags . So I do not think that America ,which is a real democracy has acted as badly as other nations did when they had the power . ",
