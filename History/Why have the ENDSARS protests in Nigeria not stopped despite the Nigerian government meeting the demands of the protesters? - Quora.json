            "answer_text": "Because the Nigerian government has not met their demands and this protest is more than just ending SARS Nigeria's democracy has been dying for years and this is simply the catalyst for larger protests. Civil rights and freedoms have been compressed, a slumped economy, increasing government corruption, complacent Federal government, and increased crime and violence. Instead of the Nigerian government actually addressing issues like crime, they create committees that give police the power to arrest anyone they want. If you look like a criminal, you get picked up. There are over 100 reported actions of rape, torture, and murder under the hands of SARS. After the protests erupted, the Nigerian government did \u201cend SARS\". However, they then created another special force nicknamed SWAT, many of the same people in SARS being there. Obviously the banning of SARS was a failed attempt to stop the international outcry. The protests have continued, the Nigerian government has sent soldiers to kill peaceful protestors, pay youth militias to damage the reputation of protestors and cause chaos, and failed to reform. The protests will continue and this may be the beginning of a social revolution. This is not a surprise as it was inevitable. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmmm!!! Where do I begin? In 2016, SARS was banned In 2017, SARS was disbanded In 2018, SARS was again, banned!! In 2019, again, SARS was banned. Now, 2020, they have \u2018finally\u2019 been banned and a new unit, created under hours to redeploy these same persons that made up the defunct SARS. Forgive our skepticism if we do not believe the govt. Years of constant lies to the populace has wired we the citizens of Nigeria to always verify before we believe them. Oh, as I write, there is a video making rounds on Twitter of SARS officials back on the streets somewhere in Lagos, making them raise their hands while passing them and mocking the people by saying \u201cuna say una no want SARS again? No be we dey here? Make una con comot us na\u201d (to paraphrase), loosely translated \u201cYou all said you want this police unit scrapped and we officers, prosecuted. But guess what bi*ches, we here, badder than before! Do your worst, f*ckers!!!\u201c Nigeria\u2019s SARS: A brief history of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad ",
