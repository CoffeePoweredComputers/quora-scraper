He could make something huge and never seen before. That is his fiduciary duty. His pitch was that since Mexicans can build a world quality resort like Cancun then Cubans who also speak Spanish should be able to do the same. After all the only difference between Mexicans and Cubans are that Mexicans come illegally to the US by foot and Cubans by boat. When Trump pitched the idea, Fidel Castro asked for proof of funds before granting a hotel license. Trump\u2019s tax return showed a $1 billion loss, which includes the trip to Cuba as tax deductible. The license was declined. It seems his candidacy is going up in smoke.  Note: in case you can't tell, this post is meant a joke. ",

Law, truth, and ethics don't really occur to him. It is the same thing that allows Trump to underpay contractors and use the courts and bankruptcy as tools to further his agenda. All that matters is that he comes out ahead. ",
