            "answer_text": "Calculations indicated the a critical mass for a U235 bomb was around 125 pounds. Considering that it constituted only 0.72% of natural uranium metal, it was going to take tons of raw uranium to get a critical amount. On the other hand, the Pu239 made from U238, was calculated to have a critical mass of only around 25 pounds. Obviously, a 5 fold reduction in needed material was was very significant! How about VERY, VERY significant. They decided to do both in hopes that one of them would work. It just so happened that they managed to run both programs and got the requisite amount of needed isotopes at almost the same time, so they both wound up being built and used almost simultaneously. Both required HUGE plants to be built, and both ran into problems making the needed isotopes in the required purity. U235 was separated from the U238 in ultracentrifuges which required careful design and the handling of fluorine and UF6, both HIGHLY reactive chemicals which require not only radiation protection but also chemical protection. It was found that the Pu239 would absorb another neutron and become Pu240 which had a much shorter half life and had to be prevented or the bomb would premature. They also found it very difficult to separate the Pu from the uranium but finally developed the Purex process which did separate them. Then, they found out that the plutonium fissioned much faster than the uranium when it absorbed a neutron, so the gun type design used for the uranium bomb wouldn\u2019t work. They devised an implosion system which worked very well as the residents of Nagasaki could testify. So the surprising thing is that in spite of two entirely different isotopes made in two entirely different ways, they both came out at just almost exactly the same time. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cTwo different types of nuclear weapons\u201d might refer to a) uranium vs. plutonium bomb, or b) gun type vs. implosion type. Uranium needs to be heavily enriched with U235 to be used for nuclear weapons. Starting from the natural uranium as a mixture of uranium isotopes, enrichment means using complex isotope separation apparatus (cascade centrifuges) because isotopes cannot be chemically separated. On the other hand, plutonium is obtained by \u201cburning\u201d of slightly enriched uranium in breeder reactors where the most abundant uranium isotope U238 is converted into plutonium. From the partially used breeder fuel, plutonium (more precisely, a mixture of plutonium isotopes) can be extracted by chemical methods in fuel processing facilities. Therefore, plutonium can be obtained in larger quantities, being made from the most abundant U238 which is otherwise useless in uranium bombs. Gun type fission bomb was made only once (for Hiroshima bomb), and was based on uranium 235. It was the simplest method to make a critical mass starting from subcritical ones, by firing a half of suitably shaped uranium mass into the other half, positioned at the end of a cannon barrel. The length of the cannon which was contained inside the bomb was about three meters and the critical mass assembled at the muzzle was about 40 kg of highly enriched uranium. But the speed of the uranium projectile was by far insufficient to make the full assembly of the critical mass: when masses were approaching and fission started, the power of the nuclear explosion opposed further joining of masses and scattered a large ammount of uranium. Therefore only a very small part of the fuel was actually used for fission. This problem was even more pronounced for plutonium, because in the mixture of plutonium isotopes there are those which spontaneously fission, giving small amount of neutrons. These neutrons would start a premature fission before the two subcritical parts fully collide at the gun muzzle, making the efficiency of the fissile material even smaller. One solution is to use a longer gun barrel, to have higher collision velocity, 9 m was considered for plutonium. But a bomb which has 9 m gun inside was impractical to load in the bombers and such a lengthy cigar-shaped bomb showed aerodinamical instability when dropped. Thus the implosion type bomb was chosen for plutonium, where a hollow spherical plutonium core is compressed by spherically shaped explosive charges, unto criticality is obtained and chain reaction started. The speed at which the mass is compressed into criticality is by far greater than the speed of gun type mass assembly, thus making an efficient plutonium weapon. What is equally important, gun type bomb is inherently unreliable in that if the gun accidentaly fires, bomb will explode with full power. On the other hand, the full power of an implosion bomb is produced only with simultaneous explosion of the all (32 to 96) explosive charges and a symmetrical core compression, which is highly unlikely in an accident. The impressive fact is that the full transition from gun type uranium bomb to implosion type plutonium bomb was made in six months, from january to july 1945. when the prototype was successfully detonated in the Trinity test.
