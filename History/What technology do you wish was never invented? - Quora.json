            "answer_text": "For me, it has to be the graphic user interface. It was the GUI which led to the widespread use of computers by the public. And now, with everyone carrying GUI-based computers in their pockets at all times, we have to deal with the social consequences of a generation addicted to video games, porn, and brain-destroying social media. Even worse, it has enabled mass government surveillance, caused potentially cancer-causing or reproductively damaging waves to spread through the atmosphere, and led to the biggest and most predatory monopolies in history (Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc.) to spring up, making billions of dollars for psychopaths who have made us slaves to their Orwellian products by \u201cevolving\u201d our culture to the point where they are de facto necessities. Imagine a world with no GUI\u2019s, where anyone who wants to use a computer has to type commands into a shell. Not so fun for most of us, is it? Computers could have remained the domain of the real nerds, who would use them for productive purposes: research, computation, and good old tinkering. Because of how far-reaching the consequences have been in so many aspects of our lives, the dumbing down of computers so that any idiot can use them is likely the most profoundly disastrous thing that has even happened in the history of humanity.

            "answer_text": "Voicemail.  Before I get into it, let's get this straight. Voicemail needs to die. There is absolutely no reason on Earth that we need voicemail any longer. Voicemail may even WANT to die. Just call her and tell me you don't hear the quiet desperation. Maybe you're a voicemail victim, like me? It all started so innocently. Out of the blue, someone calls from an unknown number on your cell. There are two thoughts you're most likely going to have \u2026 \u201cWho the hell is calling me?\u201d OR\u201cThey better be on fire\u201d You then click \u201cignore\u201d and go back to your business. 20 seconds later that infamous little jingle on your phone goes off. Yippee \u2026 a voicemail!! You give it a couple minutes waiting for the little text message chime to save you from listening to it. Minutes pass \u2026 no chime. Somehow you believed that when you hit the ignore button, that this would initiate a reasonable human being\u2019s empathy using the proper cell phone etiquette which suggests switching to a much preferred current day form of communication, like texting \u2026 But no, not this guy. NOPE - not today. This guy wants you to go through all the prompts to find out for sure who they are and what their demands are. Yes, demands will be made -they never come without a price. Then you think it\u2019s probably one of those \u201cHey it's me, call me back\u201d messages - oh what a joy! Those sure do make my day. Or even better, since you didn't recognize the number, it's gotta be one of those automated phone spam calls that you get to hear the last part of. Press 1 to hear more! FUN!  Now of course nobody on Earth wants to check their voicemail, what we all REALLY want to do is to remove that evil red \u201c1\u201d notification. (Unless of course you're one of those non-OCD freaks that doesn't mind the red dots - how do you live with such chaos?!) There's only one way outta this mess You finally go and spend that torturous 2 minutes getting through the prompts - and listen to the sooooo-important-it-couldn't-be-a-text-message-voicemail \u2026  Oh it's mom, she's calling from a different phone and she was checking to see if I got her text message from yesterday. Thank God I didn't pick up Voicemail just won't die So it turns out voicemail is an archaic time-waster and nobody likes it. But it hangs on, undead, with bits and pieces falling off but still ready to bite your ear off and chew on the gristle. But this isn't what makes it a zombie \u2026  No joke, I had an epiphany on how to help the world stop being a victim of voicemail \u2026 I would go on to share this knowledge with all my loved ones who would put me up on their shoulders, thanking me for saving them so much time and heartache. My solution \u2026 just shut it off. But, how do you shut off voicemail? Oh how naive I was. When I had this realization, I quickly called my phone provider and explained my conundrum. \u201cPlease, just turn my voicemail off and make it go back to saying the person you are calling doesn\u2019t have a voice mailbox setup\u201d The rep then goes on to tell me that they\u2019re sorry but once voicemail is activated \u2026 there is literally no way to turn it off. I had to laugh\u2026 You mean I woke up a freaking voicemail ZOMBIE!!!???  You literally cannot kill voicemail. The best you can do is to try and imagine what voicemail looks like if it took the shape of a human body, and then attempt to stab it or shoot it \u2026 just know they will survive but you'll feel slightly better somehow. I thought about it for a bit and the only real way I think you can kill voicemail \u2026 is you just stop using it. Problem is that red dot has too much power over me - it's just not that simple. So I try telling everyone who leaves me voicemail to just stop leaving me voicemails, by text, but it doesn't work. A couple months later, after checking a whole bunch of voicemails, I'm still thinking about this and come up with a reasonable solution. I finally found a way for the voicemail zombie and me to live in harmony, and it's now become something I'm know for in my circles \u2026  Do what I did: Call your voicemail now, and set a new greeting. \"I no longer listen to voicemail. Please contact me by text or email.\" You\u2019re welcome  Only telemarketers or your mom will still leave voicemails \u2026 it's quite literally the perfect filter (I LOVE YOU MOM!) Oh and if you're one of the lucky ones who never set up your voicemail, I commend your lazy ass or your incredible foresight - either way you're winning. ",

            "answer_text": "Mobile phones. Or more accurately the culture that has grown up around mobile phones, especially since the advent of the smartphone. I was 15 when my parents decided I should have a mobile phone. It was a Nokia 3210 and to be honest, I didn't really want it.  I didn't want to be contactable at all times. I didn't want to call people or send text messages, and I certainly didn't want my parents calling or texting me. Now I'm older, I still dislike mobile phones, but for different reasons: I dislike how people use them with no qualms about how they impact others. Using them in cinemas (I want to throw things at you people) Taking selfies Using them to film live shows, instead of watching the showIgnoring others and whipping out the phone mid conversation to check on a notificationChecking their phones every minute at workLet me be clear, I also do all of these things unless I catch myself, because that's what smartphones do to you. Being permanently connected to the internet means there's always something vying for your attention. Apps are designed to make you excited to use them and keep you hooked. Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and every stupid mobile game all spam you with notifications. Even Quora does. You feel compelled to check them as soon as possible and respond, lest you be left out. These apps make people miserable. Lots of studies have shown the negative impacts of social media. Recent example: Facebook and Twitter 'harm young people's mental health' They make you constantly crave attention and validation from others and place everyone in your social group in a state of silent, passive aggressive competition. Let me be clear, Internet. I don't care what you had for dinner.I don't care what the 'best boyfriend ever' bought you.I don't care what amazing places you went on Holiday.I don't care about your new diet.Stop rubbing your success in other people's faces. It's rude and it makes other people miserable. The rudeness and noise of social media, and the nagging of games and apps drives me mad. It ruins concentration and is generally a waste of time. I love the ability to have a phone, calculator, games console, camera, encyclopedia, TV, dvd player, MP3 player, bookshelf, egg timer, newspaper, torch, satnav, photo album, pen drive, radio, hands free kit and Internet portal in my hands, all day, every day. I used to have to carry so much other stuff around! Hell, put a knife, corkscrew and a bottle opener on it any you don't even need a Swiss army knife anymore either.  Of course somebody already did that\u2026 I guess my point is, mobile phones are great, but people can be oblivious to the irritation that they cause others when they use them, and the constant nagging from notifications is a curse for your mental health. /Rant over Images from Google ",

            "answer_text": "From your answers it appears they all are relating to what needs to be invented. So I will answer what should NOT been invented, leastwise for the open and general public. That is real object teleportation. Nuclear bombs & teleportation I put real object teleportation in the same boat as nuclear bombs, and I personally experience both of these inventions in my career. There is a place for both of these inventions, luckily neither are in the hands of the public. Hitler\u2019s Nazi scientists came very close to developing teleportation (Die Glocke); they substituted it instead of nuclear bombs, because teleporting would have won their war, plus allowed the Third Reich to rule the world. Benefits vs abuse Think about it, surely it offers many benefits for humanity, however, in the wrong hands it is really more dangerous than those bombs. The specie has problems with guns and knives; teleporting people to the middle of the ocean could become a daily experience, this being just one of many examples. We do have teleportation secretly Teleportation has already been invented, I experienced it with 13 other USAF personnel some 60 years ago. Thankfully it was never released to the public. Hopefully it is being used in secret today for humans to reach the stars and discovering real Earth-like planets for the specie to colonize. In this application, it offers some hope for the specie\u2019s ultimate survival. Nature or we (ourselves) could make Earth uninhabitable for us Earthlings in the future. Teleportation technology allows humans to reach the stars, find Earth-like planets and then providing the capability to colonize the planets with instant transfers between Earth and the new frontier. Concluding We can thank Hitler for the technology, some 1,600 Nazi scientists and engineers came to the U.S. after the war to advance our technologies, but we are also thankful he never got it developed before the war ended. It is a technology that should never been developed for yours\u2019 and my use today. However, the day you and I stop acting like animals; learned how to respect each other\u2019s differences and can live with them peacefully, this technology should be made available for us making our lives much easier and pleasurable. Today the stupid Americans are almost starting a civil war all over again - talking about stupidity! ",

Why: IVF has bad consequences for the mother including an increased chance of developing cancer [1] (The study\u2019s authors say the most probable explanation is that the underlying problems making women infertile also put them at greater risk of cancer. But they admit there is a small possibility that the treatment itself is to blame.)IVF with it tendency to implant multiple embryos often causes birth defects and brain damage in twins and triplets and premature birth etc.[2][3]IVF babies have higher cancer rates [4][5]IVF babies have a higher chance of being born premature [6]Premature birth has many risks for babies [7]IVF mothers are more likely to have a CS - IVF increased the likelihood of CS by 18% (p\u00bc.002).

            "answer_text": "Internet filters, or, more pejoratively, censorware. Why? First, they have their advantages and disadvantages. An advantage is that an employer could use it on their own LAN to squelch unproductive websites. A disadvantage is that the same company uses it on the public WiFi to block perfectly legitimate websites. Taco Bell installed Fortiguard and it blocks about 76% of the Internet. People go there for food and to use the Internet, and when a site is blocked, customers will find a workaround. Surprise! Fortiguard blocks those also! (Proxy Avoidance) My solution is to tether your laptop. No filters. Governments evangelize about it, but they have absolutely no idea how the Internet works. We in the USA have CIPA, the Children's Internet Protection Act, a flawed piece of legislation, that states if schools want federal funds to pay for Internet access, the filters MUST be installed. It is flawed and why Internet filters should have never been invented: The companies have claimed that they employ people to check websites for content. How is that possible? There are trillions of webpages online and thousands are added every minute. That is an impossible feat for any company to undertake. So they use heuristic automated systems that have wordlists to blacklist sites, even whole hosters just because of one page.The company can and will block sites due to ideology or personal biases of the CEO. Fortiguard blocked many LGBT sites but didn't block certain LGBT sites that had a pro-Christian anti-LGBT agenda. Ken Xie[1] is a Christian.These companies have no freaking idea of how the Internet really works. They might block one site. Oh well, that is why Google caches pages! But horrors! That's in #4.They block legitimate websites just because of a few people use it to bypass the block. Google Translate[2] is blocked by Fortiguard as \u201cProxy Avoidance\u201d because of the fact it can load pages blocked by its filters.It also blocks sites that are required for education. I've been hit with Fortiguard \u201cWebsite Blocked\u201d pages because some dipshit in California blocked a site I needed to view for my ISTEP exams. (ISTEP is the Indiana educational guidelines for graduation.)I can't even fathom why this exists. Footnotes[1] Ken Xie - Wikipedia[2] Google Translate",

            "answer_text": "Most of the people here are of the view that they wish they would have ever seen products like weapons for mass destruction like atom bombs and missiles etc. However, I have a completely different opinion, I feel these products were invented to keep yourself safe from any undue attacks. But taking undue advantage of the inventions, human beings used these products for their greed of land and money and have suddenly destroyed a chunk of earth with their use for their undue causes. Yeah, had these products never been invented, there would have been no use of them. However, blaming completely these weapons of mass destruction and not the human greed if not totally worthwhile. As per my personal opinion, I think technological products which make the human beings lazier are not at all acceptable and I wish these products were never invented. For instance, the most common example of the products that make a human being lazy is escalators. These moving stairs are really efficinet and would want you to just mount on them to get on from one place to the other. Well, I have absolutely no issues with these escalators but you ought to know that these are the products meant for disabled ones and the irony is, while the disabled people hardly ever use them, the ones who use them are hardly any disabled.  Almost 99 percent of the people would choose an escalator instead of regular staircase, whether they need to climb a single floor or two. Using them is not a bad option but you already know that climbing the regular stationary stairs is good for your health and after these escalators have been placed just beside the regular staircase, the staircase has just been a space used in emergencies or when you find excessive rush on the stairs. People who hardly exercise in the morning had a good chance of using these staircases in the subway, metros, malls and cinema places etc. However, now that the escalators are present in all such places, hardly anyone uses the staircase and this is one of the biggest promotions of laziness by technology. Yes, technology is meant to save our time and effort, but on the cost of our fitness, this technology is surely a curse. Next, I wish people would have never invented washing machines and they would have washed the clothes with their hands. I know the industrial processes where huge washers are deployed for commercial washing make it necessary to have an automatic washing machine but I think this was unnecessary for the homes. People could have washed their clothes with their hands and apart from saving a lot of water and detergent, it would have been a good way to exercise their body as well. As of now, you just need to put in your clothes and press some buttons. Your automatic washing machine does all the job without any further effort from your side. Where is the exercise in this? Nowhere?  Also, electronic home cleaners and vacuum cleaners etc. are also a waste of money and an investment on laziness. The homeowners could have easily used the manual cleaning products and kept themselves healthier in the process of cleaning their home, However, technology again plays its part and makes the homeowners lazy by using electronic products which save their time and effort and in turn, make the people lazier. And this is not just it, th world is moving towards a place where you would not need to move even an inch after waking up from your bed. Just push some buttons and you would get up from your bed automatically, brush your teeth without moving your hand, get a shower, get dressed, eat your breakfast and reach your workplace without even moving an inch. All such chores would be performed by automatic robots and even the thought of this is enough to make you happier.  However, should you be happy at all with this change? I think the world needs more physical activities to stay fitter and apart from getting up in the morning for exercise sessions, if we change our habits a bit, use staircases instead of escalators, wash our clothes manually and even clean our home with 100 percent human effort, I think we can be fitter and happier. The technology is surely our friend but it can be our worst enemy too. ",

            "answer_text": "Hand dryers. They\u2019re a terrible solution to a problem that doesn\u2019t exist.  I\u2019d bet that anyone who\u2019s used a hand dryer (even the nicer ones) knows that they don\u2019t work very well. Paper towels are faster to use and they do a better job drying your hands. But, did you know that hand dryers are less hygenic than paper towels? Studies show that the air around a normal hand dryer can have 20 times the germs around a paper towel dispenser. Cold hand dryers with powerful blowers like the Dyson Airblade are actually a lot worse. The real argument that dryer companies make, though, is that paper towel waste is bad for the environment. That's only a little true; life-cycle assessments show that paper towels are actually less wasteful than warm-air dryers (although cold dryers like the Airblade use about 1/5 the energy). Some people worry about the trees we have to cut down, but paper towels are usually made from recycled wood pulp, and they don\u2019t need the really nasty binders or bleaches. The related problem of paper waste can be solved if we just put a bit of effort in; paper towels are easily biodegradable and can be composted. By fitting paper towels into the middle of a recycling stream, we don't need to cut down any trees, and no trash has to go to a landfill. Long story short, paper towels are a clean, hygienic, and sustainable bathroom solution, and hand dryers are a completely unnecessary replacement that\u2019s actively worse. I\u2019m tired of having soggy hands for no good reason. 2020 edit: COVID just made this answer much, much more relevant. ",

            "answer_text": "Flavors.  (Source: Beware\u2026 Dunkin Donuts Flavored Coffee and a Lesson on reading labels)  (Source:Allergy Sufferers and Celiacs: Beware of Natural Flavors - The Celiac Scene) Foods are always being infused with flavors that they don\u2019t actually possess. Basically, someone in a laboratory develops compounds that taste a certain way, and companies selling processed food add those compounds to their products in order to make those products more appealing to customers. What about natural flavors, you may ask? If they\u2019re natural, they must be coming from the real thing, right? Wrong. Just because something has \u201cnatural vanilla flavor\u201d doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s actually vanilla in it. Just because something has \u201cnatural blueberry flavor\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it actually has blueberries in it. The only reason these flavors are \u201cnatural\u201d is because they are derived from compounds in vanilla or blueberries. That is, someone pinpointed which molecules were responsible for giving the real thing its flavor, took the molecules out of the real thing (or replicated those molecules), and inserted them into a food that doesn\u2019t contain the real thing. Even if the food does contain the real thing, the flavor is enhanced to unnatural proportions. This is thought to be part of what causes food addiction when it comes to processed foods. They are packed with so much more flavor than real food is that people start to . . . like them better. At least you can solve this all by eating organic, right? Wrong!  (Source: Amazon.com : Orgain Organic Hydration Powder, Orange, 7.05 Ounce, 1 Count : Grocery & Gourmet Food) \u201cOrganic Natural Flavor.\u201d They sure do put a lot of effort into making it sound appealing. Even organic food contains \u201cnatural flavor,\u201d which, as discussed above, isn\u2019t as natural as food companies would you to think. Even when you eat organic food, you aren\u2019t tasting the real thing; you are still getting some enhanced version of the real thing. The only way to avoid food flavoring is to not eat processed food at all, which is nearly impossible to do. The next time you go shopping\u2014or even to your kitchen\u2014pick up any box and look at the list of ingredients. With extremely few exceptions, you will see some sort of \u201cflavor\u201d listed on there, unless it is a box of fresh, unprocessed fruits or vegetables. Flavors . . . are . . . everywhere. And I hate them. They are lies. They do nothing other than make our food taste unnaturally intense, and then when people eat unprocessed food, it tastes boring in comparison, so they stick with processed food, which is generally more unhealthy (not necessarily due to flavoring, but still true). And then the word \u201cnatural\u201d is attached to some flavors to make it seem more wholesome, when really it\u2019s not. Flavors are flavors. No matter where they are derived from, they are not a natural part of food, and a good portion of the world\u2019s population probably doesn\u2019t even know how food naturally tastes. ",
