            "answer_text": "Revenue. When the speed limit was reduced to 55 mph speeding tickets were issued from then on out because of \u201csafety.\u201d Bull. Speeding tickets should have been handed out for using too much gas which is why the 55 mph limit was instituted by Nixon. As far as the safety arguement, our highways were constructed to handle 75 mph. So they were dramatically safer at 55 mph. If there are legitimate studies showing that. Eisenhower built the interstate system on the model of the Autobahn. Which since Hitler constructed, was for rapid military mobilization, is limitless in most of it limited only by force masseur like weather or unexpectedly heavy traffic. A speeding ticket for exceeding 55 mph based on the mantra of safety is irrational. A speeding ticket based on exceeding 75 mph based on safety is legit because the interstate system was based on 75 mph. ",

I would think the \u201cpoint\u201d would be obvious, to cause you to change your driving habits. Personally I think you get peoples attention with a big fine more than you do jail time, but, that\u2019s just me. Speed is a factor in over 3/4\u2019s of fatal accidents. That would be the \u201cpoint\u201d. ",
