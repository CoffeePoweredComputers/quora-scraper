            "answer_text": "Servants fell in to two main groups - indoor and outdoor. Female servants would be almost entirely indoor servants in Victorian days Indoor servants fell in to two groups those who worked upstairs and those who did not - the latter mainly kitchen staff The largest houses would have great specialisation with ladies maids, nursery maids, parlour maids and chamber maids under the supervision of a housekeeper working upstairs and kitchen maids and scullery maids in the kitchen under the supervision of the Cook. The Nanny was technically not a servant, neither was the Governess (who taught older children). The least wealthy people to employ servants would employ a daily maid who just came in during the day like a normal job. Slightly wealthier people would have a live in \u201cmaid of all work\u201d who would perform every duty from the highest (answering the door) to the lowest (scrubbing the kitchen floor) - the nick name of this appointment was \u201cslavey\u201d so you can see it was not a highly sought after post. In a larger household scullery maid was the worst female job - scrub the floors, wash the pots, fetch and carry for more senior kitchen staff. The highest female appointment was ladies maid who was basically a ladies batman/valet looking after her clothes and personal admin. Off duty and out of uniform many ladies maids could almost pass as ladies to the untrained eye. ",

            "answer_text": "Female servants came in all shapes and sizes. Large, rich households would have a female cook, possibly also a housekeeper, a couple of \u201cTweenies\u201d (\u201cbetween floors\u201d) who did the dirty work, like cleaning out, re-laying and lighting all the fires in the rooms, housemaids, parlour maids, ladies\u2019 maids (one for each adult female member of the family), kitchen maids. The men were Butlers, footmen, coachmen, grooms, gardeners, etc. Then, if there were children, the Nursery would require at least one Nurse (nanny), a junior nurse and a wet-nurse (at least one of each per child) and, eventually, a Governess, who was not exactly a servant, but not exactly one of the family either. Less rich people would make do with a smaller selection, possibly just a cook and housemaid. So there was plenty of scope for working women who wanted to go \u201cinto service\u201d. ",

To give you an idea, my grandparents had a minimum of 24 indoor servants in all their properties in the UK and abroad. A huge percentage of the population was in service, in all Western countries. ",
