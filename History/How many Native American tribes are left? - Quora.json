            "answer_text": "One important premise for your research is to avoid speaking of the aboriginal peoples of the Western Hemisphere as though they were extinct or hovering on the edge of extinction. There are hundreds of millions of people in North and South America of Native American ancestry, and there is a disturbing and insulting tendency these days for otherwise well-meaning people to speak of them in the past tense. You should also make a distinction as to whether you are discussing the original historical population of the Western Hemisphere, of North America, of temperate North America, or the United States. There are currently upwards of 600 recognized Native American tribes in the United States (List of federally recognized tribes and List of Alaska Native tribal entities), another 600 in Canads (First Nations People in Canada), several hundred more in South America (List of Indigenous peoples of South America). Most of the population of Central America (Central American Indian Tribes and Languages) is either part of a recognized Native American ethnic group or has some Native American ancestry. The links above should be enough to get you started. ",
