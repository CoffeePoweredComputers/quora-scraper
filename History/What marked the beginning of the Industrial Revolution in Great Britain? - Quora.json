            "answer_text": "It began with the mass immigration of religious refugees from France and Belgium in the 17th Century. Protestants were a persecuted minority in France, and a determined effort was made to convert them to Catholicism at the edge of the sword, so not surprisingly, they fled in all directions. Many of them had occupied important places in society, and many were skilled tradesmen, so France\u2019s brain drain was England\u2019s gain. Elizabeth 1 welcomed them, and the Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act of 1708 gave them citizenship. They brought with them many craft skills, including market gardening, glass making, pottery and weaving, that had been lacking in England. Their output created a demand for manufactured goods that previously didn\u2019t exist, leading to the growth of an industrial base that fueled its own demand. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that the the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in England (it spread from England to the rest of Great Britain and on to the world) was in the brewing industry which went from being a kitchen table affair to being industrialised. This started to happen in about 1750. The industrialisation of brewing allowed greater urbanisation in a time when it was a brave man that drank the water in a city. ",
