            "answer_text": "After 1945 the four allied forces agreed to run Germany as a whole entity, this also included the possibility for German citizens to travel between different occupation zones. But soon it became clear that the Soviet Union wanted to keep their part of the country separately. They also wanted to get full control over Berlin, so they shut off the three transit routes which granted access to West Berlin in 1948. This lead to the famous Berlin air lift - West Berlin with about two million inhabitants was fully supplied by air freight for over a year. After these incidents the Western allied forces made clear that they would not tolerate this again, and the Soviets did not dare to start a war over West Berlin. So they opened the transit routes again, three street routes, several water routes and three railroad routes. However, it was a pain in the ass to travel between West Berlin and Western Germany. You had to apply for a visa, pay a fee, you were thoroughly checked, also your luggage and your car. It was obvious that East German authorities wanted to make the travel as inconvenient as possible. If you wanted to avoid that or if you had a security classification or other reasons not to get in touch with communist officers, you had to fly. Things became better in 1971, when the Allied Forces set up a new four forces treaty which enforced a transit traffic agreement to be negotiated between East and West Germany. This was the first treaty which was negotiated at state level, and it was the de-facto recognition of the GDR as an own country. The transit traffic agreement became effective on June 3rd, 1972, and it brought a vast improvement for travel between West Germany and West Berlin. All Western citizens (both Germans and Foreigners) could just travel over a transit route in their car. They had to show their passport and got a visa for passage directly at the drive-through counter. They did not have to pay a fee. Close inspections of the luggage or the car were limited to cases of suspicious circumstances, they rarely took place. West Berlin citizens had to present their ID card.  The image above shows Transit checkpoint in Berlin Dreilinden. You could also travel by train. The East German border patrol did all the stuff during the travel. Neverless, travelling through East Germany remained a nasty thing. When crossing the border, you often had to wait for 45 minutes or longer (and you had to cross the border twice). Most parts of the Transit routes were Autobahns in pre-war condition. The maximun speed was limited to 100 km/h (62 mph) and strictly enforced by East German police. Your time of enter in the GDR was recorded, and when you needed too long to arrive at the exit you had to explain what you did so long. The situation stayed hostile. The transit traffic agreement cost West Germany a lot of money. They payed more than 2 billion German Marks (today approx 5 billion Euro) for setting up the premises for border control and improving the routes. And they paid the traffic fees which probably were another couple of hundreds of millions. One personal story at last: I was on service in the West German armed forces until Oct. 1983. I was member of an armoured reconnaissance bataillon. One of my tasks was to keep the bataillon library of military handbooks up to date. We had so called \"Luftfahrzeugerkennungshandb\u00fccher\", booklets which contained images of allied and hostile aircraft of all kind. These booklets should teach the soldiers how certain planes and helicopters looked like in order to spot them correctly. The most frightening thing I saw in this book was this beast:  Say hello to the Mil Mi24 attack helicopter - NATO Code \"Hind\". This beast is so effective, they still use it today. I always thought: \"If you ever should spot one of these in real life, you will be in big, big trouble.\" A few months before the end of my draft I got the admission to study at Free University Berlin in West Berlin. This required me to travel to West Berlin to enroll to university. Besides that I needed to organize a room for me to live in Berlin. But I was a soldier of the Federal armed forces, and West Berlin was surrounded by the enemy. Going there by plane was not really an option, it would have cost me three months worth of salary. So I applied for a permission to travel through the GDR by car. I had to talk to the commander of the bataillon for that (the first and only time I talked to this man). He ordered me to leave everything in West Germany which could identify me as a Soldier, he forbid me to admit that I am a soldier, and he let me go. And then I was there, sitting in my rusty '71 Opel Kadett and carefully driving East over the Transit route. And there she was: A Hind helicopter, hovering at 30 feet above the ground, just appearing behind the trees. I almost sh*t in my pants. (I travelled the transit routes for four years, and I almost never had any trouble, with the exception of November 1987, but that is a different story\u2026) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes! This was even a guaranteed right demanded by the west allies. The sovjets didn't want that and tried to sabotage it by blocking access after the war to enforce west allies to give up West Berlin. But instead this was leading to the well known \u201cLuftbr\u00fccke\u201d (air bridge, when hundreds of planes ensured that west berlin got food and supplies, leading to an much stronger better relation between west berliners and the west allies). In the aftermath east germany granted access again to the so called \u201cTransitstrecken\u201d, which was basically a bigger transit road through east germany territory. As a child I was traveling with my mother to my uncle living in west berlin because of excemption from military service for Germans there. There were east german restaurants along the transit road. I remember that the waitress was in particular not interested to be friendly at all, this was often the case for eastern waiters and waitresses. My mother allowed me the first time to order a Cola. I was surprised but happy. What I didn't know was that eastern germany didn't use Coca Cola but produced their own kind of Cola tasting like piss. My mother did have a.lot of fun watching my face after tasting it \ud83d\ude0f ",
