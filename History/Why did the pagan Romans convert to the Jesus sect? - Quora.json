            "answer_text": "One important reason was that in the Pagan religion, it was alot about what u could sacrifice to the gods. Tis in turn costed money allowing the wealthy to get closer to the gods then most. When Christanity appeared, it was 1st of its kind to simply say anyone can get into heaven. Mobey didnt mean anything. It literally leveled the playing field. The meek will inherit heaven. Also, it forgave for a sinful past. This was also not a common practice within Paganism. Side note; Paganism had ALOT of different ceremonues, costumes, and things ppl would do. There was a god for many different things. Money, war, health ect. So after the emperor Constantine adopted Christianity as the \u201c official\u201d religion of the Roman Empire, most ppl had a hard time letting their pagan ways and customs go. So they kept alot of them and just prayed to God/Christ. This is why today Catholics have so many different funny hats, burndt offerings, many different saints to pray to, all the different staffs and cantors the pope , cardinals and preists carry or swing around. The huge cathedrals, ect. interesting\u2026isnt it, ",

            "answer_text": "Details given as: \u201cRoman culture was accepting of other religions, whilst enforcing at least public adherence to the official pantheon. Why did they end up converting to Christianity, which, at the time, was only one of a long list of foreign religious sects?\u201d Most \u201cforeign sects\u201d were fine with a public adherence either to Roman Pantheon or Roman Emperor\u2019s Genius. Two weren\u2019t, Jews and Christians. This irritated and it intrigued. Jews rebelled and were beaten and were then tolerated, but not liked. THey used the position of toleration, at least in some places, to persecute the Christians there. Christians were even more enigmatic, they suffered martyrdom after martyrdom and went on, and miracles happened. Legio Fulminatrix won miraculously over Marcomanns under Marcus Aurelius. Two options : either the Christians were praying (as they later did about Lepanto and Battle of Vienna, 1571 and 1683), or an Egyptian magician was very much more efficient than Egyptian magicians usually are. Other miracles were in the favour of Christianity. At the same time, both Judaism and even more Christianity were responding to certain aspirations of Platonism. ",
