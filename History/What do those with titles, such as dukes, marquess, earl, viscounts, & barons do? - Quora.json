            "answer_text": "It depends on the era. Initially, the title of duke (dux) was a Roman military title, a grade if you want, and therefore was not hereditary. Same with count (comes), that means companion. Marquis was a military title at the time of the Carolingian Frank Empire that meant defender of a march, so a buffer zone between the Empire and other states (instead of a Westphalian linear border). So when Romans speak of a dux of Tripolitania or a comes of Africa, it\u2019s totally not hereditary charges. It\u2019s mere military titles. This is why these titles are often not translated to avoid these assumptions. It\u2019s with the feudal disintegration of the Carolingian Empire that these titles became the ones of a new hereditary sword nobility. Offices that were supposed to be granted by the emperor turned into hereditary titles as the emperor lost centralized control. Criminal bands known as \u201cknights\u201d would become legitimized and integrated into that system, and later we would pretend they had stuff like \u201cchivalry\u201d instead of just being mafia syndicates. Initially, the concept of nobilitas in a Roman sense meant people with notability, people that were famous and had prominent social roles, that were magistrates. It could totally include people that were \u201ccommoners\u201d (Plebeians), and not just \u201cnobles\u201d (Patricians). It\u2019s later that \u201cnobility\u201d would mean a military hereditary class that had legal privileges due to their bloodlines (as opposed to wealth). Eventually, it would become titles attached to fiefdoms, so you were for example a count because your peculiar lordship was a \u201ccounty\u201d, and such fiefdoms were called fiefdom of \u201cdignity\u201d, as opposed to the more common untitled lordships. In France the least prestigious title was ch\u00e2telain, attached to a ch\u00e2tellenie (castellany). I don\u2019t think there is a clear hierarchy between those titles, unlike what video games usually suggest. Besides, the monarch of an independent state could be called by any of those titles, without implying subordination or vassalization automatically. For example, the King of Naples was in an Union of Crowns with Provence, and in Provence his title was count. It was a common occurence. The current orl\u00e9aniste pretender of the French throne, Jean de France, is count of Paris, and his son would be duke of Vend\u00f4me. That\u2019s not like in games in which a duke is always the overlord of a count in a systematic way. Traditionally, the heir of France was duke of Dauphin\u00e9, hence the nickname Dauphin (Dolphin).

            "answer_text": "This is only the most cursory of responses. The subject of the British monarchy, aristocracy and nobility is immense and has filled libraries with various accounts and observations. Until the 1950s, the answer would have been: very little. Those with hereditary titles\u2014 and incomes and palatial estates\u2014 were supported by the State, just as the British monarchy and bits of the aristocracy and nobility are today. In the aftermath of WW I Britain was a damaged country. The best and the brightest and been sacrificed in the war. After the Depression the country was crippled. Before the country had gotten back on its feet, WW II wiped out the rest of the best and brightest.* Post-war governments, composed of many of those who weren\u2019t able to fight or otherwise contribute, established the Socialism Lite cradle-to-grave welfare state. Brexit is only the culmination of a society run for the benefit of those who know all their rights but shun their responsibilities. To pay for it, the aristocracy and nobility\u2014 who contributed greatly to both war efforts and were decimated by them\u2014 saw their incomes reduced and were taxed on their properties at rates that made it impossible for them to do anything but sell out or turn estates over to the public with the reservation that they could keep living in the old piles. \u201cDeath duties,\u201d what we call inheritance taxes, were pushed up to confiscatory levels on the propertied classes. Only a few aristocrats managed to escape this attempt to reduce everyone to the least common denominator. One of them, Gerald Grosvenor, the late Duke of Westminster, owned 300 hereditary acres in London, home of pricey real estate. His net worth at death was nearly \u00a310 billion ($13 billion). But to finally answer your question, these days the nobility and aristocracy, some of the best educated, best connected in the country, have real jobs, usually at the executive level, in major corporations, in government or academia. ______________________________________ *If you\u2019re interested in pursuing the topic, I recommend The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy by by David Cannadine. Insightful and witty. ",
