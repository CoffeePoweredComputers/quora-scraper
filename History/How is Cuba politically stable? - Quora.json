            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 What a complex question to answer\u2026 As a Cuban citizen, older than 18 years old (and therefore adult according to the Cuban laws, I\u2019m 19), living all my life in Cuba (never been in other countries before mostly because my family has no money to travel for leisure), spending (or should I say wasting) my time serving the army in the Obligatory Military Service and as a member of the UJC (Communist Young Union, heritage of the AJR, Association of Young Rebels, founded by Major. Ernesto Guevara \u201cEl Che\u201d) I feel able to talk with confidence about the Cuban pollitical stabillity. Well, in the first place, I may begin telling that there\u2019s (STILL) a strong union between the people and its leaders. Since Osvaldo Dortic\u00f3s Torrado, who was president until 1973 (while Fidel was Prime Minister), we have had 3 presidents: * Cmdr. in Chief Fidel Castro Ruz, * General of the Army, Raul Castro Ruz * Miguel Mario D\u00edaz-Canel Berm\u00fadez. Fidel\u2026 You may criticize Fidel, you may state he\u2019s a dictator, you may state several things about Fidel\u2019s person. Some may be true (we can\u2019t be blind). He commited mistakes, true. He unmounted once the sugar factories when the sugar price got low, and some other stuff he did. Yeah, ok. That\u2019s true. But the facts says that even with those mistakes, Cuban people always supported Fidel. And that\u2019s completely true. I can even tell you, once in august, 1994 (the worse years of the Special Period in time of peace, the period following the U.S.S.R collapse) the people got rebel in La Habana. There was a huge manifestation. People yelling \u201cAbajo la Revoluci\u00f3n!\u201d and so. Stone throwing started. Then Fidel came into scene. He dismounted the vehicle he was in. He approached to the populace, he grabbed a stone and he said that he also wanted to throw stones too. Everybody inmediately (EVERYBODY) changed their minds and starting praising him. It\u2019s madness but it\u2019s completely true. I don\u2019t know if that fact is studied anywhere outside from Cuba. Why did they praised him, even when people had to eat cats and dogs, some had to travel over 40 miles in bycicle to get the food to feed their families? Well, I disagree to the \u201ccommon\u201d opinion that Cuba was a paradise before 1959. My mother\u2019s family was landowner and they did not had any economic issues (they even got a TV, one of the first in the Cuban eastern, historically the poorest region) but my father\u2019s\u2026 My father\u2019s family was another thing. My granma was farmer that never went to the school. She has 6th degree I think. My granma gave birth to six children on a hill, three of them before 1959. It was hard for them to survive, since my grandfather left my grandmother alone. That was the situation of the Cuban farmers before 1959. They starved to death, while the woman gave birth 5, 10, 20 kids. The kids then grew up with no healthcare available\u2026 I may continue, but I\u2019m going to stop here to state this: Being Fidel the soul (yes, the soul, no chovinism involved) of the Cuban Revolution, then Fidel provided us: * An alphabetization campaign that taught to read and write to the 97% of the Cubans. * Free healthcare (to everyone), in a time when free healthcare was a privilege of developed countries. * An important development (contrary to what \u201ceverybody\u201d says) on industry. (Watch the full interview of El Ch\u00e9 and Lisa Howard) * The practice of sports as a right of the people. That\u2019s why all the cuban sportsman are amateur. * A hope that things would improve. And they actually did, until the collapse of the Soviet Union. Then everything went down the sink, yet the Cuban people did not lost their will to fight, and to survive, and to develop. We never rennounced to free universal healthcare, to free education, to free (and supported by the state) practice of sports\u2026 And all of that was thanks to Fidel labour. So, he commited mistakes, he was human. Yes, he was an authoritarian person, that was a part of his personality. He never liked losing anything and he liked being in control. Another mistake commited (not by him this time) was that no one ever dared to diverge from his opinions, nor in private or in public. Yet, I feel lucky, because thanks to Fidel\u2019s labour (and Raul\u2019s labour by extension) my father, son of a farmer, was able to graduate on Informatics and came to be Vicepresident of a Conglomerate (state conglomerate, of course). Well, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel represents continuity from the ideas of Fidel. He started having rather low approval but after we saw what was he doing we started liking him better. During the tornado that stroke Havana in January 28 2018 (Jose Mart\u00ed\u2019s birthday) he went personally to visit the people that were left with nothing at all. He occupied of those people. Since D\u00edaz-Canel rise to the power, we have seen incremented the communication between the people and the government institutions. And almost everybody approves the government management of COVID-19. Well. That was the positive thing. Now for the negative, as a true revolutionary shall always know the flaws of the social project we build, in order to be able to repair those flaws. Repression in Cuba is an undisputable fact. It exists indeed. I have never been repressed or censored anyway (although I\u2019m not a political activist) for listening american music, for example. I\u2019m a heavy metal fan, a genre which perhaps it\u2019s incompatible to the cuban culture (as some people may want to make believe), but I have never been repressed for listening that \u201cimperialist music\u201d anyway. Well, for some, repression is a fact. Everybody has repression, don\u2019t be blind anyway and don\u2019t judge by external influences. Many massive media journalist speaking shit about Cuba have never been actually in Cuba, and those who has been come to Cuba to enjoy the beaches and \u201cRaul Castro\u2019s hotels\u201d (omg) and they like them, so, please, those people, stop with the hipocrisy. Cuba has a very efficient intelligence service inside of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (to which I belong now since I\u2019m serving for a year, so I can give first hand information about it. I serve at those Intelligence Services) And Cuban government has the WHOLE army of their side. The WHOLE i said. I mean, many high PCC (Communist Party) chairmans are members of the FAR (the armed forces). By the way, Raul Castro does not belongs to the FAR since 2008. He was FAR\u2019s minister since 1959 to 2008, but now he\u2019s not member of the FAR. As every retired Cuban military staff member, he still preserves the military rank. Those intelligence services are used to neutralize any threat to the Cuban national security (speaking in U.S terms; just as U.S does anyway) Threats are for example, journalists that are payed to speak bad things about Cuba and so. Things like Cuban medic personnel are slaves\u2026 omg. I have an aunt that\u2019s doctor. Well is currently on Angola. She told me once that she feels in debt to the Cuban Revolution, for letting her study and become a doctor. Without Cuban Revolution she would probably have becomed farmer, just as my granma was. By the way, I have never been starving. I\u2019m hungry now, but nothing that can\u2019t be solved with a travel to the fridge. \u00a1Patria o Muerte!\u00a1Venceremos! POSTDATA: Really, need to watch the interview of El Ch\u00e9 with Lisa Howard. It\u2019s freaking awesome. ",
