            "answer_text": "None. It was actually Protestants who removed the 7 books of the Apocrypha, but the Catholic Church did not remove books from the Bible. These books were just never part of the Bible to begin with. To begin with, the Jews canonized the Hebrew Scriptures in 100 CE. That set the official canon of what we call the Old Testament. When you read about \u201cThe Scriptures\u201d in the New Testament, these are the books that they are referring to. However, in chapter 3, verse 16 of the New Testament epistle 2 Peter, the author makes an interesting allusion to Paul's writings being taken as Scripture by early Christians. What this would mean is that by the second half of the 1st century, after Paul's death, it would seem that his letters were being copied and circulated around Christian churches, and treated as spiritually authoritative. Based on the writings of 2nd century Christians, we can say with confidence that the Tetramorph was established by 160 CE. The Tetramorph is the collection of the four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Ten years later, in 170, a scrap known as the Muratorian Fragment lists the Tetramorph, Acts of the Apostles, the Pauline and Johanine Epistles, and the Epistle of Jude as Scripture. So by the mid-2nd century, the groundwork of the New Testament's canon is already laid out. In 367, Athanasius of Alexandria wrote a list of scriptures that was identical to the 27 books of the existing New Testament. The Council of Rome in 382 officially declared this same list to be the Christian Bible. So why did those particular books get chosen for the New Testament? Why not the Gospel of Thomas? Or the Gospel of Mary Magdalene? There is a lot of furor that these books were \u201cbanned\u201d or \u201ctaken out\u201d of the Bible. But that's not true. They were never part of the Bible. Whenever some new \u201clost gospel\u201d is discovered, there is always the question in the media of whether it will become part of the Bible or if it will totally change everything we think we know and that sort of thing. The answer is no, because the books of the New Testament were chosen for a reason. Those reasons still stand. The criteria for what books became part of the New testament is actually not very different from the criteria that scholars use to determine the authenticity of any historical text. First of all, they have to be of an early date, close to the events they describe. The earlier, the better. All the books in the New Testament were written within 60 years of Jesus' death. In fact, those books are ALL the known, remaining books written about Jesus within the 60 years after Jesus' death. Skeptics ask why there aren't any writings about Jesus from that time that aren't in the Bible. But here's the thing: if there were any other extant books about Jesus from that time period, they WOULD BE in the New Testament and the skeptic would still be asking the same question. This is why it is important to recognize that the Bible is an anthology. The New Testament wasn't written by one person. It is a collection of books written by multiple people. Secondly, all the books of the New Testament had to be connected to people who knew Jesus. There has been some debate in scholarly circles about who exactly wrote what. We don't even know who wrote the Epistle to the Hebrews. No name is given, but we can be sure it was a 1st century Jewish Christian. It is likely that Paul wrote most of the Epistles attributed to him, however. And there is no real reason to doubt that one of the Marks mentioned in the New Testament wrote his Gospel and that Luke wrote his. What is unquestionable is that all these texts were written within the lifetimes of people who knew Jesus. The criteria of multiple attestation comes in here as well. Why do you think there are four Gospels? And do you seriously think that for 2000 years nobody noticed that they don't quite line up perfectly in all their details until modern atheists came onto YouTube or Twitter or Quora and blew our minds? No. We've got four Gospels in there so that between them, we can have a really good grasp on who Jesus was and what He taught. Finally, these books had to be in widespread use within the Church. It wasn't just a bunch of Bishops in Rome deciding which books were in the Bible. They were following what most churches around the known world were already using. They didn't want to just pick whatever random books used by whatever random congregation. They wanted to make sure that these were the books that Christian tradition and the largest part of the Church already recognized as being authoritative. So it's not accurate to ask what the Vatican \u201ctook out\u201d of the Bible. The answer is nothing. A more proper question would be \u201cWhat did the Catholic Church leave out of the Bible?\u201d and then discuss why. ",

            "answer_text": "+JMJ+ You are confused, The Vatican is the instrument that God used to write and publish the Bible. It is only because of Rome\u2019s guarantee that we have a Bible at all. It was established at the end of the fourth century by Pope St. Damasus I at the Council of Rome (A.D. 382) and the Council of Carthage (A.D. 397) and then given to St. Jerome to translate the entire thing into Latin. The ONLY books which were removed from the Bible were the Deuterocanonicals by the Protestants in the sixteenth century in an attempt to remove the Christian books of the Old Testament so that the Bible would more closely reflect their heretical beliefs (thus the name \u201cProtestant\u201d). from Modern Catholic Dictionary by John A. Hardon, S.J. Doubleday & Co., Inc. Garden City, NY 1980 Deuterocanonical. Referring to those books and passages of the Old and New Testaments about which there was controversy at one time in early Christian history. In the Old Testament they are Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus (Sirach), Baruch, I and II Maccabees, parts of Ester (10:4-16, 14) and Daniel (3:24-90, 13, 14). In the New Testament are Hebrews, James, II Peter, II and III John, Revelation (Apocalypse), and Mark 16:9-20. All of these are recognized by the Catholic Church as part of the biblical canon. Among Protestants the Deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament are rejected as apocryphal, along with the last twelve verses of Mark\u2019s Gospel. ",
