            "answer_text": "There are literature as manuscripts from three areas. Of course there is a lot of literature from Egypt, going back to antiquity. But Ethiopia was also a literature culture. Much of it religious as might be expected. In fact the Ethiopian Bible has 55 books, more than others. It also offers a different perspective and was a great discovery along with the Syriac versions of the Bible both of which were of great interest early in the 20th century and influence theology. I purposely saved the best for last. In Timbuctu all the great families have manuscripts from Mali and Songhay and later right up to the French take-over and were hidden for a Century from the Europeans. There is now a project to digitalize all of them and eventually put them on line. They were in Arabic. And it looks very much that there are more manuscripts in Timbuctu than all of Europe. Combined with the other cultures, Africa is richer and more varied set of manuscripts than Europe. ",

            "answer_text": "Some of the oldest literature in the world is from ancient Egypt which, lest people forget, is in Africa. A great many works of philosophy and the like were produced in the city of Alexandria which, again, is in Africa. And St. Augustine lived and worked in Numidia, so some of the foundational works of Christian theology are African as well And of course there was a lot of writing being done in North Africa through the Middle Ages. But perhaps this question is about sub-Saharan Africa, in which case the answer is still less, though there\u2019s somewhat less material coming out of there, since writing was introduced somewhat later. But Ethiopia has literate traditions going back to late antiquity, Timbuktu was a major center of scholarship through the Middle Ages, and there were other centers of literacy here and there. ",
