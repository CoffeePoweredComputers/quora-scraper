            "answer_text": "The Balkenkreuz WAS adopted by the Deutsche Bundeswehr in 1955 and has been in use as an emblem on their military equipment ever since. The Iron Cross as a medal-for-valor was rejected by the new German Federal Republic as having become too closely connected with its Nazi legacy in WW2. The new Bundeswehr design carefully departed from the straight-armed emblem of the Third Reich. It was based on the World War One (monarchy) Balkenkreuz and the curvature angle of its arms was made even more extreme. The present-day German army carries the heritage of Germanic militarism that reaches back to similar black cross designs in use by the Teutonic Knights from at least the 12th-century. Modern German military associations began with Prussian adaptation during the Napoleonic Wars of the early-19th century. The Balkenkreuz is considered an historical cross derivative of the Christian cross pattee. It is generally accepted that it is not a hate symbol. It has taken on many other associations. Since WW2, it has become the biker\u2019s cross of rebellion, the surfer\u2019s cross of free spirits, a death-rock symbol of anarchy, and can be found in numerous other fashion, jewelry, and sportswear applications. As such, the cross is often seen in colors other than black. It is probably the only element of German militarism that was able to transcend a strong association with Nazism following WW2. When the Bundeswehr serves in Islamic countries, the cross is painted over with the tricolor German flag, which is further identified by painted-on Arabic text at its center. This seeks to dispel the notion that German soldiers are Christian Crusaders. However, the Bundeswehr did authorize a circular moral patch for soldiers serving in Afghanistan, which featured a medieval Teutonic knight with a Balkenkreuz emblazoned on his surcoat. Also, to honor acts of valor by German soldiers in this locale (their first significant war zone since WW2) the Germany government finally adopted a new cross-for-valor to replace the Iron Cross. It bears some resemblance to the British George Cross and nothing to remind one of the Balkenkreuz design of the old Iron Cross medal. ",

            "answer_text": "The Balkenkreuz was widely used by the Nazi war machine, specifically the Luftwaffe and Wehrmacht because it was painted on their vehicles and equipment. It was a no-brainer to not use it.  The real question is why that variation of the Eisernes Kreuz is used.  This Iron Cross is from the 13th century:  The Teutonic Knights is a bit too far removed from the current nation state of Germany. Since then, literally a 1000-year-old Reich had risen and fallen (the Holy Roman Empire). This style was also used during Germany in WWI. This Iron Cross is from the 19th century:  It was first awarded to Prussian troops fighting Napoleon. Prussia was the foundation of the modern German nation state. Seems like a much better candidate. So those are the rationalizations. But the answer is pretty simple when it comes to branding: what are (current) people's (contemporary) perceptions of each symbol?   Teutonic Knights, the Red Baron, motorcycle gangs, death metal... nope!   Anschlu\u00df, Blitzkrieg, Heil Hitler... hell no!   Iron Cross! With swords? Oak leaves? Whatever... German! Military! Pass.
