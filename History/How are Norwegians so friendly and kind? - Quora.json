            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A! Firstly, I'm happy to hear that you've had such nice experiences with fellow Norwegians. However, I am sure that you will find such people in all other countries as well. And also, for sure, not all Norwegians behave the way you described. It might be possible that we have a higher percentage of the population fitting your description. I'll try to suggest some possible reasons below. An affluent, equal society where we traditionally have a high level of trust in society and public administration to be fair and not corrupt.Mostly secular, a significant part of our population will marry in church, many also go to church for Christmas and dome even on Sundays, but in general, the majority of our population have a worldview based on modern scientific understanding of the world. We've had climate change taught in schools for the last 35 years or more, and a carbon tax on fuel for at least 25 years. Unfortunately, there's an increase in anti-vaccination and other anti-scientific attitudes now, also Norway is affected by fake news and fake science.Not having had any large unrest due to racial or religious opposition for the last millennium, most of our population feels safer to embrace cultural, religious and racial diversity. Norway was united by force, and later the population was forced, again by military force, to renounce the Norse gods and become Catholic. At the (possibly mythological) Battle of Stiklestad on 29 July 1030, King Olav Haraldsson \u201cthe Holy\u201d lost against heathen local kings / lords. He was canonized after his death, the date is a national holiday, and the battle is marked with a theatrical reenactment at the largest outdoor theatre in Scandinavia, located at the historical site every year since 1954. Since 1030 we haven't had any major military operations on our territory due to religion. The skirmishes with the Danes and Swedes over the centuries, and a short campaign of resistance against the Nazi invasion in the spring of 1940, were all about political and/or territorial claims.There are some clouds on the horizon, including a worry about Islam-related terrorism as well as our own homegrown Christianity-related terrorism. Our population in general understands that modern terrorists professing allegiance to one of the three major monotheistic religions are not actually following the modern interpretation of their own holy scriptures, but rather a medieval interpretation focusing on killing \u201cinfidels\u201d, just like our own Vikings, whose religion of course included the war god Thor, a parallel to Ares, Athena and Mars in the Greek and Roman religions.In general, it is possible that our Danish and Swedish neighbours have become slightly more cynical and less welcoming, due to recent events. However, if you look at people from Syria and other war-torn countries, or from Greece and other poor countries, you will often find kindness and hospitality far exceeding that of Norwegians. So I am not sure this type of explanation is correct.",

            "answer_text": "Aw, you're too kind. No, really, you're too kind. Norwegians probably aren't any kinder than other people. What we excel at, however, is conflict avoidance and fear of social disapproval. Even the slightest whiff of disagreement and disapproval is enough to send most Norwegian running for the hills. I mean that literally \u2014 they're making for the hytte, or cabin, in the woods where they can be alone to decompress from the experience. That conflict avoidance is what leads Norwegians to be so exaggeratedly accommodating, unassuming, and polite. It's such a noticeable feature of the culture that we have a word for it: \u201cSnillisme\u201d, or niceism. Snillisme er et begrep som s\u00e6rlig henviser til bedriftsledere og myndigheter. Det er misforst\u00e5tt snillhet som g\u00e5r ut p\u00e5 \u00e5 v\u00e6re overdrevent forst\u00e5elsesfull og im\u00f8tekommende, ofte av frykt for \u00e5 ta upopul\u00e6re avgj\u00f8relser. Snillisme \u2013 Wikipedia Translation: Snillisme is a concept particularly applicable to business leadership and government. It's misapplied niceness manifesting itself in exaggerated efforts to be understanding and accommodating, often out of fear of making unpopular decisions. You have to understand that, for Norwegians, social disapproval is practically tangible \u2014 we can feel it in the air, like a miasma. Sometimes it's so thick even foreigners feel it. They're not sure what it is, but it's uncomfortable as hell. Makes people want to flee for the hytte, where there's nothing but blueberries, moose turds, and silence. So, you see, we're not kind. We're frightened. ",
