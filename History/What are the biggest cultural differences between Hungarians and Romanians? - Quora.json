            "answer_text": "I am coming from both cultures as I grew up in a mix Romanian and Hungarian family, being fond of both. I could list a lot of peculiar differences, but found that only 4 are important First at the foundational level, the two culture belong to different streams. The Romanian culture followed through the Roman tradition through all its stages to the end of it, that is the fall of Constantinople. Even now, if you pay a visit to any Romanian Churches you can have an immediate visual representation of the Eastern Roman Empire and its evolution in time. With them, the notion of continuity and evolution are very visible. The Hungarian culture on the other hand is quite conservative but inventive on is own. It adopted a lot from Central Europe, but at its core it is individualistic. In short, the two cultures are opposite in terms of origin, one has been evolving from an ancient European stock, the other is not. In this aspect linguistic difference between the two culture is self evident. The Romanian language evolved from Latin, whereas the Hungarian language evolved from a 10th century import The second difference comes from the Religious foundation. The Hungarian culture has been molded most recently by Protestantism (Calvinistic) and also Roman Catholicism. These two gives the culture a sense of familiarity with a western observer. The Romanian culture is based on Orthodox Christianity, which for an untrained western observer should seem oriental only because the western Catholicism is Germanic (the Mediterranean aspect of it has long been erased) The third difference is from recently influences. The Romanian culture has been strongly influenced by the French and the English one. That is the result of a sustained effort by the local intelligentsia for the 18 and 19th century to reorient the culture as a support for new markets (More lucrative Western trade), The Hungarian culture has been strongly influence by the Austrian and the German. Between the two cultures, the Hungarian one seems to be more inline with its Western neighbour, versus the Romanian one that seems like a Western implant in the Eastern Europe The fourth difference is with diversity. The Hungarian culture is somewhat monochromatic. Very little diversity comes from both a history of uniformity but also its demographical size. The Romanian culture is diverse. Having been formed at the borderland between multiple cultural spaces, one can find strong regional diversity ",

            "answer_text": "Culturally, both islam and the semi-asian orthodox countries were traditionally west-hater civilizations. THE WESTERN (Catholic-protestant) WORLD is depicted in dark blue on the map of prof. S. Huntington:  What is Western Civilization? The earliest mention of Western civilization \u201cOccidental civilis\u201d After the Great Schism (The East-West Schism /formally in 1054/, between Western Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christianity.) Hungary determined itself as the easternmost bastion of Western civilisation (This statement was affirmed later by Pope Pius II who wrote that to Emperor Friedrich III, \u201cHungary is the shield of Christianity and the protector of Western civilization\u201d) It is not a secret in history, that countries civilizations are/were not in the same level of development. It is well-known that Western and Central Europe, ( the so-called Western civilization) was always more developed than Orthodox Slavic or Eastern European civilization. The differences in culture (material and verbal), legal constitutional, societal, political, economical, infrastructural, technological and scientific development, between Orthodox countries and Western Christian (Catholic-Protestant) countries were similar great, as the differences between Northern America (USA Canada) and Southern- (Latino) America. MEMENTO: Western things which were not existed in orthodox world: 1. POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL development: Medieval appearance of parliaments (The parliament is a legislative body(!), DO NOT CONFUSE with the \u201ccouncils of monarchs\u201d which existed since the very beginnings of human history), the estates of the realm, the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners, 2. Local SELF GOVERNMENT status of big royal/imperial cities, which are the direct ancestors (the continuity) of modern local self governmental systems. Do not confuse the local self governments with the so-called city states. Sovereign city states were the earliest form of states in Human history ( For example: Sumerian city states), and that legal concept has nothing common with the self-governments/local governments of cities within a country or within an Empire. 3. ECONOMY: The medieval appearance of banking systems and social effects and status of urban bourgeoisie, the absolute dominance of money-economy (when the vast majority of trade based on money and the taxes customs duties were collected in money) from the 12th -13th century, instead of the former primitive bartel-based commerce (barter dominated the economies orthodox world until the 17-18th centuries.) 4. HIGHER EDUCATION: The medieval appearance of universities and the medieval appearance of SECULAR intellectuals, 5. CULTURE: Knights, the knight-culture, chivalric code, (and the technological effects of crusades from the Holy Land,) Music and literature: courtly love, troubadours, Gregorian chant, Ars nova, Organum, Motet, Madrigal, Canon and Ballata, Liturgical drama, Novellas, medieval western THEATER: Mystery or cycle plays, morality and passion plays, which developed into the renaissance theater, the direct ancestor of modern theaters. Philosophy: Scholasticism and humanist philosophy, 6. The medieval usage of Latin alphabet and medieval spread of movable type printing, 7. TECHNOLOGY: The guild system is an association of artisans or merchants, which organized the training education, and directed master's exam system for artisians. Due to the compulsory foreign studies of the artisian master's candidates, the guilds played key role in the fast spread of technologies and industrial knowledge in the medieval Western World. 8. The defence systems & fortifications: The spread of stone/brick castle defense -systems, the town-walls of western cities from the 11th century. (In the orthodox world, only some capital cities had such a walls . The countries of the Balkan region and the territory of Russian states fell under Ottoman/Mongolian rule very rapidly - with a single decisive open-field battle - due to the lack of the networks of stone/brick castles and fortresses in these countries. The only exception was the greek inhabited Byzantine territories which were well fortified.) 9. FINEARTS and ARCHITECTURE: western architecture, sculpture paintings and fine-arts: the Romanesque style, the Gothic style and the Renaissance style. The orthodox church buildings and \u201epalaces(?)\u201d were very little, they had primitive structure and poor decorations, their style were influenced by oriental non-European arabic, persian and Syrian influenced Byzantine ornamentics. 10.The renaissance & humanism , the reformation and the enlightenment did not influenced/affected the Orthodox (Eastern European) countries. 11. Before 1870, the industrialization that had developed in Western and Central Europe and the United States did not extend in any significant way to the rest of the world. In Eastern Europe, industrialization lagged far behind, and started only in the 20th century. Their infrastructural and economic development was also very very slow, and many determinant factors of modern civilization - as we called them as civilized way of life - (railways, the electrification of cities, drain & sewer systems, water pipe systems, spread of tap water and bathrooms, telecommuncations etc... spread many-many decades (60-80 years) later. It is no wonder that their contribution in science technology and innovations are completely negligible in Human history by the WESTERN standards. ",
