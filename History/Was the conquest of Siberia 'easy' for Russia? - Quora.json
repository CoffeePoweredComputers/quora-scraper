            "answer_text": "Yes. I wouldn\u2019t even call it \u201cconquest\u201d of Siberia. Rather an \u201cabsorption\u201d. There was some violence involved, like the initial wars with the descendant kingdoms of Golden Horde, and a low-level war with Chukchies in the far North-East that went on and off for two centuries. Otherwise, it looked much like the European expansion westward in the forests of North America: a mix of skirmishes, trade, and occasional slaughtering on both sides. The absorption went on the back of mixed Russian-Turkic gangs, later known as Cossack, that went after furs (hugely profitable commodity at the time) and the rumors about hidden Mongol treasures. Because of the dominant illiteracy, few accounts are left of their adventures. The European tradition of documenting travels and discoveries came to Siberia first with the Germans sent there by Peter the Great. If you have seen the movie \u201cThe Revenant\u201d, it\u2019s approximately how it happened from the end of 1500s onwards on our side of the Pacific, too.  ",

            "answer_text": "There was no conquest at the time of Ermak moved into the Siberian territory and established the first settlment. The resistance from the local population started much later and it continues until now. As far as I know from my parents and grand-parents, it is not safe for unarmed people with european face to wonder around Sakha (Yakutsk) region, as well as in many other Siberian regions for that matter. In many cases, people simply shoot to kill and there are no material consequences to that as there is very little population. In most cases there will be no investigation and no case filed. People are missing in Taiga all the time. To put it simple - the conquest is still very much in progress. It takes palce on individual level. ",
