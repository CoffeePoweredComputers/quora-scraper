            "answer_text": "Sort of\u2026. In the early part of the North African campaign British armour was painted a mix of sand, slate grey and what I\u2019d call sky blue (I think the official spec was silver grey but as a modeller I do find that the same shade of paint from two different modelling companies can be quite different\u2026. online forums are full of modellers arguing about RAL numbers and how modern samples compare to original paint revealed during restoration of real vehicles! )  Its both a disruptive pattern which breaks up the distinctive tank shape and well chosen for blending in with the horizon (parts of the western desert are perfectly flat). The slate grey would fade to a paler blue making the tank appear more blue than sand over time. The same scheme was applied to many other vehicles. The British armed forces take camouflage very seriously. The masters were the Long Range Desert Group (widely credited to be the first modern special forces). This is a 1/16 model of one of their chevy trucks I built a few years ago   The Azure and sand was a common cammo but the trucks would be repainted for each mission to match the specific terrain. Bright pink wasn\u2019t uncommon and is still used by the SAS in the desert:  A very pale pink was used for some photo-recon spitfires (a good colour for blending in with cloud during sunrise) We got the pink paint out again for Gulf War 91  As I said we take camo seriously\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "From what I have found, the Imperial War Museum actually incorrectly painted their Matilda 2, which led to the \u201cfake\u201d paint schemes that are displayed in model kits and pictures. Official documents from 1940 about the desert camouflage do not include blue as a color.  As for the confusion, veterans from the British tank divisions may have mistakenly recounted their tanks as being painted as \u201can god-awful shade of blue\u201d. This led to the \u201cfake\u201d camouflage being painted on the Imperial War Museum\u2019s Matilda 2. If the tank was actually painted blue, it was more of a bluish-grey shade rather than a pure blue color. The bluish-grey color scheme was part of a three tone camouflage. This camouflage would have been used as disruption camouflage to make the tank harder to hit in the desert terrain.
