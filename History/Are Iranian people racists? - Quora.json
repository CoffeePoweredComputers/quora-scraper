            "answer_text": "Not in a general sense but can be mistaken accordingly. Iranians are proud of their ancestry by family tree especially if one famous or influencial person is noted in between branches. This is ofcourse related to race but the concept is totally different. That is because persons of multiple races maybe found within the three due to intermarriages and prodigious is on gainings by a bravery or talent not natural given particulars. Noteworthy, no one believes that bravery or talent is related to race as people believe it comes with consistency through hard work and faith. However, we pay millions for an Arab horse by race but not a penny for an English horse and not call it racist. ",

Of course they are always racist ones in every society but to say 80+ million people are racists is too much. Iranians are welcoming and hospitable people according to the people who visited Iran.  Please read this wonderful article written by a foreigner who visited Iran. Surprising Iran, land of hospitality ",

You see, when a nation if many cultures, languages and ideologies are gathered under one flag and one country it is almost a necessity to give them something in common to avoid tribal wars. We have many different languages in Iran but the formal language has been enforced and accepted as Farsi. All we have in common is that we are all very proud Iranians. The same goes for this very young country America. ",
