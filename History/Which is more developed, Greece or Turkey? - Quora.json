            "answer_text": "The answer is Republic of Turkey. However, the country must be viewed in 2 cases. These cases are: 1-) The State\u2019s development 2-) The People\u2019s development If you are talking about the state\u2019s development, Republic of Turkey is in a better shape almost in every way. Her economy is bigger than Greece\u2019s. Although Repuclic of Turkey is unfortunately at the edge of an economic corruption, her economic position is still amongst one of the top 20 economies in the world (Number 16). Also, Turkish Army is WAY stronger than Greek Army. Republic of Turkey has an army which is the 8th strongest army in the world. Therefore, her power is not a one to be underestimated. Additionally, Turkish metropols are almost no different to European or American metropols such as Paris, Berlin, London, New York etc. Turkish cities such as \u0130stanbul, \u0130zmir and Ankara are really developed in many ways (Structural and architectural designs, people\u2019s mindsets, visual aspects of people, education levels, social classes etc.). They also hold a huge value for the country\u2019s economy. On the other hand, Repuclic of Turkey is still struggling with her own imperial past. Believe it or not, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s revolutions and ideas ACTUALLY managed to establish themselves throughtout decades. While the country\u2019s current ruling party and president draws more of a Pro-Islamic profile, it is impossible to deny the fact that Turkish nation acknowledges, respects and obeys the path that Atat\u00fcrk chose; which is secular, modern, republican and nationalist. Most people would be shocked to see how Republic of Turkey actually resembles with well developed western nations and countries. However, as you go East in the country, more the people become conservative and fanaticly religious. Such people are unfortunately not satisfied with the country\u2019s republican and secular rule since they think that these ideas clash significantly with Islamic laws. Therefore, while Republic of Turkey hosts millions of people who are living a life no different to Western people in any way, she also hosts millions of people who lives more conservatively and religiously.

            "answer_text": "The answer is clearly Greece. ECONOMYMany Turks think that their economy is better because it is bigger. This is not how it works - GDP per capita is the true measure of economy, as otherwise Turkey would have a \u2018better\u2019 economy than Switzerland which we all know is not at all the case. So: Greece GDP / GDP Per Capita: $224.033 billion / $20,930 Turkey GDP / GDP Per Capita: $631 billion / $7,615 Hence, despite its gigantic crisis, Greece is still doing MUCH better than Turkey in terms of income. DEVELOPMENT COEFFICIENTSGreece scores higher on BOTH the HDI and GINI coefficients. HDI measures a wide range of aspects, such as life expectancy, education and so on. Higher is better.In 2017, Greece scored 0.870 which is VERY HIGH, whereas Turkey scored 0.791 which is HIGH. Comparatively, the countries are not even close, with Greece being 31st in the world, while Turkey 64th. 2. GINI measures income inequality. Lower is better. Greece has a GINI score of 0.34, while Turkey 0.40. Hence, Greece is clearly rated more highly. QUALITY OF INFRASTRUCTUREThe HDI includes this but special mention is due on other metrics too. Overall, Greece has a higher infrastructural development than Turkey. On a scale from 0\u2013100, Greece scores 76.2 whereas Turkey scores 72.6. The difference might not seem big, but it is quite significant. [SOURCE: Quality of infrastructure: countries with best infrastructure 2018 | Statista] EDUCATIONAgain included by HDI but also deserves special mention. In the Education Index, Greece scores 0.830, while Turkey is far below that at 0.668. Also, in terms of tertiary education attainment, Greece is doing much better than Turkey. For ages 25-64, Greece has a percentage of approximately 28%, while Turkey 17%. QUALITY OF HEALTHCAREFinally, there\u2019s quality of healthcare. Admittedly, Greece\u2019s healthcare suffered tremendously during the crisis - yet is it still much higher than Turkey\u2019s. In 2016, Greece scored 84, whereas Turkey 80.7. In fact, Turkey has among the highest mortality rates for serious diseases. Also read The Lancet - https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)30994-2/fulltext  To conclude, anyone who can judge impartially will readily and obviously say Greece is MORE developed on all things that matter. Some Turks like to say that we should judge Western Turkey only but that\u2019s not how it works - otherwise we might as well judge Mykonos v Turkey - we judge the entirety of the countries, since indeed concentration of wealth to one part of the country shows weak economic planning.
