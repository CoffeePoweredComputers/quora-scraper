            "answer_text": " (Constantinople) First, very quickly, the differences: the West spoke Latin and the East spoke Greek, the West was Catholic and had a Pope while the East was Orthodox and had a Patriarch. Also, the Eastern Empire was far wealthier. By the end of the Western Empire, the West had a major trade deficit with the East. As for similarities, the East still called themselves Roman and viewed themselves as the sole heir to the fallen Western Empire. Also many traditions such as chariot racing and the military triumph were celebrated in the East well past the fall of the West. Constantinople had a huge stadium called the Hippodrome which could seat 150,000 people, bigger than any stadium today. This is obviously similar to the famed Coliseum in Rome. The East had a senate like it\u2019s Western kin, although this wasn\u2019t as powerful as the old senate in the era of the Republic because the East was ruled by an Emperor with essentially absolute power. The East used the same military tactics before the West fell but slowly introduced new military ideas like the Varangian guard afterwards. In fact, as time went on, the Eastern Empire had to mold itself to a new world in which the very powerful Muslims along with Bulgars and Serbs ate away at their borders. The differences are more pronounced than their similarities for this reason.  (the Hippodrome in Constantinople) However I do not think people should see the Eastern Romans as weak and dwindling. Perhaps the most intimate similarity between the two empires is that they were both very powerful entities on the global stage for a thousand years! The Eastern Romans were able to fend off a half dozen sieges on Constantinople and even gained territories that the Romans never had prior to the fall of the West. Many people say that Charles Martel is the savior of Europe because he defeated the forces of the Caliph at the battle of Tours in 732. Yet it was the main Muslim force that laid siege to Constantinople in 717 and was defeated by Emperor Leo III with the the use of Greek fire (a medieval form of napalm that could spray fire over one hundred meters). Constantinople remained the largest city of Medieval Europe and was a beacon of light burning the flame of the eternal city in an otherwise dark age for the continent.  ",

            "answer_text": "They are both in Rome. You might find about the same amount of traffic. People speak about the very same dialect. Municipalities are numbered with Roman numbers in both parts. The Tiber river could be considered a boundary for both sides. They are both within the GRA (the highway circling around the city for 70 km) But, just out of curiosity: where did you hear this \u201ceaster/western\u201d thing about Rome? And, if you ask for the similarities I suspect you know the differences\u2026 ",
