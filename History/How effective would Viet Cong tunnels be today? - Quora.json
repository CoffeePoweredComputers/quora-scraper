            "answer_text": "I\u2019m afraid I have a different opinion than Steven Gaudry and Dave Scheller. And please note that I, thank God, do not have any experience in digging tunnels, or fighting in them. Heck, I\u2019ve never been on the front lines of a shooting war (and you ALL should be glad of that, since most of my time in the military was spent on a submarine with nuclear missiles). Nevertheless, it seems to me that, while it MAY be possible nowadays for fancy equipment like ground penetrating radar, etc. to be able to map out tunnels without having to go in (just hope you don\u2019t get shot while trying to man-handle that heavy bit of tech over fallen logs or desert rocks), or have armed ROVs (remotely operated vehicles) drive through the tunnels and \u201cneutralize\u201d any enemy combatants found \u2026the reality is that tunnels are still effective to this day. That\u2019s why the drug smugglers continue to dig them under the US-Mexican border: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36099336 and why Hamas continues to dig them: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/05/israel-discovers-hamas-tunnel-under-border-with-gaza?CMP=share_btn_link Also, elsewhere in the world: SEOUL UNCOVERS A BORDER TUNNEL Sure, they get discovered occasionally, but it\u2019s usually not as a result of using fancy, expensive equipment to scan randomly selected areas of land. Not even the US military has enough money to equip many soldiers/units with that kind of specialized equipment, nor the manpower to operate it EVERYWHERE. No, first you have to suspect\u2026 or accidently discover \u2026 that the tunnel is there. How do you go about that? I would expect that this would be by finding enemy combatants popping up where you aren\u2019t expecting them behind your sentry lines, or suspecting that supplies getting through to the enemy when you know that they didn\u2019t get there over land. Or interrogating prisoners. Or just patrolling along and stumbling onto a tunnel entrance. Once a tunnel is discovered\u2026 what troop commander is going to say, \u201cOkay post a squad of sentries on this tunnel entrance, and send back to the Engineers (or whatever unit operates this equipment) to get a team air-lifted out here to send a robot in. We\u2019ll just have to live with this known weak point in our area for the hours/ days/ weeks it takes to assemble a team to explore and clear out this tunnel, during which our enemy can be amassing a large combat force right below our feet, building branch tunnels (or readying to use pre-existing branch tunnels) and readying to pop up and kill us all.\u201d? Nope, I think that that commanding officer is going to send some people down into the discovered tunnel more or less immediately. And one last thing: I\u2019m not sure how realistic it is to try to drill a small-diameter bore hole down tens of meters deep (the article on the Hamas tunnel says it was 29 meters (95 feet) trying to intercept a tunnel that might be only six feet wide (the size of the Korean \u201cinvasion tunnel\u201d, OR LESS, so you can stick a boroscope into it. My drill bits tend to wander in dry wood\u2026. and I don\u2019t have to contend with random rocks sitting in relatively soft surrounding material, just waiting to deflect my drill off path . And the ability to drill that deep would require some specialized equipment, probably a truck, which means it can be hard to maneuver in a combat situation over all the terrain a tunnel might go under. At least, that is my thinking. But\u2026I\u2019m a submariner. All the holes I bored were nuclear powered (and in the ocean). I\u2019m waiting to see what recently experienced soldiers or Marines have to say on this topic. ",

            "answer_text": "I will not give the actual host or other details of the requestor, but a company mass RFP for terrestrial cavity detection last year. My solution was not chosen. The detection is currently erratic, especially when suspicions are not sufficiently aroused for a determined search. Water, earth material, depth, size, shape and other issues make a large change in effectiveness. Mostly it was dealing with construction failures rather than security, but I am telling you the technology is hardly thorough presently. All successful war activity involves discovery of weaknesses and strengths detection. You cover up and misdirect yours while noticing the (accurate) extent of others \u2014 friend, foe, so called neutral. Avoid the enemy's strengths, to maximize and focus upon yours. Trust no one as much as can be safely tolerated, including allies and own forces. Information is on a need to know basis. Do not presume not tunnels or spider holes especially where earth material prevents detection and aids construction. We have not seen the last of tunnels by any means. Hopefully the USAF will not build any more airports directly on top of a huge, pre existing tunnel complex, as I have been informed sadly took place in Vietnam War near Bien Hoa IIRC. ",
