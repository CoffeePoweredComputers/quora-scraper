            "answer_text": "  Excellent observation.  There was a time  when it was once considered that something termed  \"Human Nature\"  existed. Currently, the terminology has been discredited in the sciences, and has fallen into disuse.  It does appear in a lot of modern literature however,  even though it actually means nothing.   Many people write things in some \"generalized\" contexts, which they cannot substantiate with factual data.     What you cited was one of the examples of an author's employment of rhetoric that in any factual context, is meaningless.     Many people seem to have never noticed that we  live in an age, in which scientific fact and objective evidences are  de rigeur.    What has been overlooked is that    there is a virtual glut of modern literature that is nothing more but   rhetoric. Anyone not wishing to be totally mislead needs to be a stickler for the facts. Rhetoric is not probative.      If someone is writing  to offer some analysis, it sounds far more \"flowery\" and sophisticated to write:   The nature and extent\"  than it is to write only, \"the extent\" of something.    But you are right. This is useless and meaningless verbiage.      At the same time,  an author might legitimately write on such a subject and use phrasing like this:     \"The Salient Contributions and Extent of Australia`s  Involvement in World War Two\"   You have a very sharp mind to catch this.
