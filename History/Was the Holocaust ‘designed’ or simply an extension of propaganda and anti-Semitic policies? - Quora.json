            "answer_text": "In the sense that the Nazi vision was to mass exterminate Jews right back in 1930, it wasn\u2019t planned. Hitler had a vague idea about expanding Germany East and increasing living space for Germans in favour of \u201clesser races\u201d. including Poles, Slavs and Jews. The reality was an impossible logistical nightmare. Poland had a population of 30+ million, Yugoslavia 15+ million The Czech regions under German control 15+ million. This was insignificant compared to the populations in occupied Soviet territory. Initially the program was quite simple, confiscate the property of Jews and replace those prominent Jews with a new class of Nazi elite, who would control the occupied regions of the expanded German state. But in order to capitalize of the status as Germans as the master race they had to create a hierarchy below them. Jews would naturally fall at the bottom. In order to justify their status as the lowest of the low Jews were deliberately unabled in anything more than manual labour and then rendered unfit for the task by poor rations in the hope that they would eventually waste away. The Nazi doctrine determined that Jews were useless mouths and they were determined to prove it. Only this just created a self fulfilling prophecy by rendering the Jewish population the model of their dogma, the Nazis indeed found themselves with a logistical liability and with an impasse in advancing their degradation of the Poles and Slavs into servile puppets of the Master Race. With the conquest of the Soviet Union stalling, the Nazis needed to advance their social engineering and the logical way was to to destroy the lowest class and begin a new program by replacing it with the next level, perhaps without reducing their efficiency to the economy to the same extent. Knock it down and start again. ",

            "answer_text": "The Nazi\u2019s never referred to their project as the Holocaust and called it \u201cThe Final solution to the Jewish Question.\u201d It was hoped that a quick round up and summary execution would take care of the situation, but it proved too slow, too public and had negative effects on the personnel carrying out the work. A side project was euthanizing \u201cthose unfit for life\u201d, meaning those believed to be a hindrance to Nazi ideals. Started with the mentally ill / physically disabled and reached a point where the Nazi\u2019s were starting to expand it to disabled soldier; This last part started protests in Germany. The side project were the experiments that lead to the Final Solution, that allowed for extermination on an industrial scale and only slowed by the need for slave labour. ( The biggest finding was the use of collaborators to lead people into the chambers and then handle the cleanup, no more direct involvement by German personnel.) ",
