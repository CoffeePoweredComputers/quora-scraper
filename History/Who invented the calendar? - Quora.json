            "answer_text": "There\u2019s actually a quote from Sandi Toksvig about this, weirdly enough. She was at university, studying anthropology, when the professor held up a photograph of a bone with 28 markings on it. The professor said \u201cThis is alleged to be man\u2019s first attempt at a calendar\u201d Everyone made a note of it, then the professor said \u201cTell me - what man needs to know when 28 days have passed?\u201d At which point there was silence. The point being there are good odds the first calendar was probably invented by a woman, because - as that professor pointed out - there are good odds a woman would need to keep track of the days probably far more than a man would. It\u2019s not entirely clear who discovered it, but it is - apparently - generally accepted that the first calendar was made by a woman way back at the dawn of history. ",

            "answer_text": "No one really knows. Safe guess, however, would be, Prophet Adam (PBUH), as he was taught many things by God Himself. Holy Qura\u2019an does mention how Allah (SWT) has made, the sun and the moon to cause the alternation of the day and night (Time passed) and the stars for the directions to find the ways. It also mentions the division of twelve months of a year.  \u201cHe taught the human being what he did not know\u201d (Q, 96:5) \"For you (God) subjected the night and the day, the sun and the moon; the stars are in subjection to His Command. Verily in this are signs for people who are wise.\" (Q, 16: 12) The practical angle from which this perfect celestial order is seen is underlined on account of its value as an aid to man's travel on earth and by sea and to his calculation of time. This comment becomes clear when one bears in mind the fact that the Quran was originally a preaching addressed to men who only understood the simple language of their everyday lives. This explains the presence of the following reflections. \"(God) is the One Who has set out for you the stars, that you may guide yourselves by them through the darkness of the land and of the sea. We have detailed the signs for people who know.\" (Q, 6:97) \"(God sets on the earth) landmarks and by the stars (men) guide themselves.\" (Q, 16:16) \"God is the One Who made the sun a shining glory and the moon a light and for her ordained mansions, so that you might know the number of years and the reckoning (of the time). God created this in truth. He explains the signs in detail for people who know.\" (Q, 10\u20335) Read:-Psychological dimension of Qura\u2019an Had we sent down Qura\u2019an to a mountain, you would have seen, it humbled, burst apart due to (His) God\u2019s awe (Surah Hashar 59, V-21) ",
