            "answer_text": "I do not know how you can exclude the one's who became president. I am thinking of Theodore Roosevelt who became president after McKinley was assassinated so Roosevelt became president. Teddy Roosevelt was an extraordinary man. Rich as hell but keenly intune with the regular man. He wanted wide reforms of sweat shop worker's caring about their safety. In fact he was rattling the Republicans so much that's why they put him on the ticket to make him go away. Funny how destiny stirs the pot. This mans first invitation at the white house after he became president was to Booker Washington. Of course they dogged him for a very long time about that. He had the Panama canal built which was huge for Panama and the world really. But the best thing I think is all the national park's he set up. He recognized that nature is essential. Likewise Lindon Johnson set up the great society welfare to try and help family's that were struggling. Civil rights, Medicare, Medicaid. Public broadcasting, a call to action on the war on poverty. These 2 men moved mountain's getting their ideas to fruition. Their policy's shaped America. One's a republican and the other a democrat but both extraordinary men not perfect by any means but at the core they cared deeply for their country and it's people. ",

            "answer_text": "None really. Woodrow Wilson had a vice president that an anarchist tried to kill. his bomb exploded near the veep\u2019s office, but the veep wasn\u2019t hurt. FDR\u2019s last veep, before Truman, Henry Wallace was a near communist who later ran for president on a 3rd party ticket, almost draining enough votes from Truman to let Dewey win. The Chicago paper even published a headline \u201cDEWEY WINS\u201d before final results came in. More recently, we\u2019ve had vice presidents Mondale, Humphrey, Kerry, Gore, all run for president & lose. All Senators too. Kerry going on to also be a Secretary of State involved in the Iran deals. Maybe Kerry wins the prize, for good or bad. Some thought Kerry might run in 2016, but apparently Biden swept everyone away, including Kerry. Biden seems to be in the Humphrey, Mondale, Gore, Kerry mold, another veep running and likely losing too. Nelson Rockefeller was Ford\u2019s vice president. His wealth and name leave a legacy of his ancestor John D. Rockefeller. as well as Nelson\u2019s time as NY Governor. ",

            "answer_text": "George H W Bush comes immediately to mind. His two terms as VP cemented his place among Republicans, and a term as President established the family among the nation\u2019s top households. After George (41) stepped down his sons Jeb and George each had successful two-term stints as governor (Florida and Texas respectively) and George 43 went on to win two terms as president. Richard Nixon\u2019s two terms as vice president during the 1950s elevated his status sufficiently that he would become a respected figure in Republican politics, and later win two elections to the White House. Although his career did not create legacy in the fashion that Bush did for his sons, Nixon\u2019s impact on the world stage is arguably more important than those of the Bush presidencies. ",
