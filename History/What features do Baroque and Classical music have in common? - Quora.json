            "answer_text": "The form. The most notable musical form of classical era is sonata. Its form consists of exposition with two themes, development, and recapitulation of the two themes. The baroque had a form called Invention that consisted of exposition that had one theme that was then imitated in other voices, development, and sometimes recapitulation. Just like a fugue. See the pattern? If you really want to hear the traits common for baroque and classical period, you should listen to Haydn. By the time Mozart became the main guy, sonata already took its well known form and composers were already playing with it, while Haydn was really in a\u2026let's say a period where sonata was in a beta version. Other stuff similar? Harmony. You can't really invent hot water and classical period just added some new awesome harmony for the instruments that got improved. The difference is in the style you'd play the piece, the rhythm (baroque is more constant in the rhythm), the orchestra size and instruments. It is well known that classical period was brought by baroque becoming so complicated that it practically collapsed on itself so maybe it's fair to assume classical is just what happens when you redo baroque, while romanticism is continuation of classical period.

            "answer_text": "During the baroque period, there were two kinds of music: instrumental and vocal. All instrumental music was created in a polyphonic texture - with two or more seemingly independent melodies going on simultaneously. In contrast, in order to accommodate opera\u2019s textual material, making it more accessible and comprehensible to the listening public, composers starting with Claudio Monteverdi began composing operas in a homophonic texture, one involving a melody accompanied by harmonies. In marked contrast, during the classical period all music, both instrumental and vocal, was composed in a homophonic texture. ",
