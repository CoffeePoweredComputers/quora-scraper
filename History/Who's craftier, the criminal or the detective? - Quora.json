Detectives live in a insulated Ivory Tower and don\u2019t know which suspect lives in which district or what that guy is good for pulling. The patrol officer is constantly bumping into the bad guys - every day - on the street. The patrol officer gets to know the weaknesses of every bad guy and helps the detective use those weaknesses to the detective\u2019s advantage. It\u2019s a team effort. Either one alone can muddle through but it\u2019s better to have them work together. ",
