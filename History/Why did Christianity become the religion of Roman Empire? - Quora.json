            "answer_text": "The watershed event for the Roman Empire was when Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity and declared himself \"Emporer of the Christians\". There's a lot of question about why/how he converted. He was likely influenced by his mother and there are sources that will talk about him having a dream or a vision (or both) that told him he would be victorious in battle if he followed the Christian God. He did win several key battles while fighting under a Christian flag, and that kind of cemented things under his rule. After that he became a patron of sorts - building basilicas, promoting the study of the faith, returning confiscated property, etc. Interestingly, Constantine didn't force his people to convert and in fact under him the Roman Empire issued edicts that provided for the rights of the people to practice any form of worship they wanted to and stated that the government could not force a religion on anyone. Later on things changed and Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire. It actually did happen fairly suddenly, though. Once Constantine converted, it was only a matter of maybe a decade or two before Christianity became the primary religion of the Empire. I have put this at the top of the list not because it came first or was the deciding factor but because it is a single and significant turning point. Before the conversion of Constantine and his subsequent legalizing of Christianity with the Edict of Milan (313 AD), Christianity had never enjoyed state recognition. Contrary to many narratives, this did not always mean they were persecuted, either by the state or other groups. Still, Christianity had never held official status, as opposed to the Judaism, which was a legal religion due to its being sufficiently ancient. Christianity would not become the state religion of the Empire until Theodosius I issued the Edict of Thessalonica in 380 AD, but legality did a great deal. For the first time, a church could be built publicly, for example (before this time, Christians often worshiped in house churches or cemeteries). What's more, under Constantine the church began to receive a great deal of favor from the state, e.g. bishops came to hold important magisterial power in the empire, money was given by the state to build and furnish lavish churches in city centers. For the first time, the church became a major avenue for career advancement. Consider for example Ambrose (340-387 AD), who was the governor of an Italian province before he became the bishop of Milan--this would have been inconceivable before the legality of Christianity. Eusebius' The History of the Church from Christ to Constantine is sort of the definitive text on the subject, written by a contemporary of Constantine's. Constantine chose to adopt Christianity for the Roman Empire. Christian scholars will naturally argue it was a true conversion and religious experience and tout it as evidence of the divine power of God. Secular scholars will contend that he did so with an eye on the politics and expediency. The truth, like most things, likely lies closer to the middle than the extreme. It is impossible to know which of those is true and certainly visions in the sky seem improbable, though not impossible for a man who was by all accounts entirely sane. On the other hand Constantine hardly required the backing of Christians to claim power in Rome or for that matter the Empire and while they were a growing minority they hardly represented a significant political or military obstacle to his power. Thus we are given a conundrum and are forced to decipher through the lines. As previously stated Christians were a growing minority and perhaps Constantine decided to generate goodwill with a growing base from which he could generate almost fanatical support without firmly committing to them for the time being. Perhaps he wanted to believe he was God's handpicked man a fact which would likely have played to any man's ego. Or perhaps he truly was a man of devout faith who genuinely converted and carried out the will of God. The simple fact remains that for the time being we'll likely never be able to divine his true intent or belief and instead we'll continue to devolve into this patchwork speculation on a man more complicated than most by the requirements of faith, politics, and warfare.

            "answer_text": "A couple of reasons, but first it is worth noting that the Romans never really invested the time or effort into seriously trying to eradicate Christianity. Numerous Emperors declared the religion illegal and called for the death of Christians, but consistent Empire-wide persecution is largely a myth. Most of the persecution was sporadic and regional, often with local officials getting overzealous or seeking-scapegoats for societal issues or other crimes. Among the general population, it is noted by scholars that there was little appetite in general for rounding up and executing Christians. From the second century onwards, most Christians were fellow members of the empire - including relatives, friends, colleagues, etc. Romans might have enjoyed blood sports at the arenas, but they weren't bloodthirsty enough to see the persecution of Christians through in the same way they did other traditions like Manichaeism (which was seen as foreign to the Empire). Eventually, Christians became a sizable percentage of both citizens and non-citizens and even the spouses, parents and advisers of non-Christian Emperors. Constantine and his line of successors who privileged Christianity, favored it and eventually adopted it as the official religion, weren't really doing anything incredibly radical so much as acknowledging the changes that were occurring in the wider Empire. Much of their family was Christian and so were many Romans among including the nobility - and who, by supporting them and funding Church building - allowed the Emperors to build up a sizable pool of support (which in turn facilitated the growth of the religion before it became the sole religion of the Empire). Eventually, it made sense politically, socially and economically to adopt Christianity as the sole religion of the Empire - as the culmination of a slow but gradual process that took a few hundred years to reach.
