            "answer_text": "Breaking India forces have since time immemorial used these two battles to humiliate Indians - to show that Indians are always losers. Breaking India forces also claim them to be some sort of decisive battles. And of course, Indian patriotic response is to say the exact opposite - it was grand success for Indians. But objective truth is that these two battles were defeats for Indian side - BUT they are at best inconsequential side-shows. Observations on Alexander - Why as Alexander forced to retreat? Because his army refused to move any further. Why? Not because they were home-sick as claimed by many. Greek sources themselves clearly state Macedonian troops had little appetite to fight the Xandrammes (Dhana Nanda?) and his vast army beyond Ganga. Note their experience in conquest of small kingdoms and republics in North West India was extremely bloody and scary. So they were not really sure whether proceeding further into India was a wise option. Now note - Poros was just one among the many Indian powers who had fought Alexander. All of them fought well and bled Greek army Giving too much focus of Poros alone does a disrespect to other valiant Indian states. With Regard to Haldi-Ghati - Haldi-Ghati was not the final victory of Akbar over Pratap as claimed by pro-Mughal writers. Far from being a final victory, it was the beginning of a 11 years long war between Pratap and Akbar. Pratap after fiasco at Haldi-Ghati used guerrilla warfare from Aravalli hills and forests tying down some 35,000 Mughal troops in Mewar. In addition to this, Akbar sent six special expeditions to hunt down Pratap - each expedition with nearly 100,000 men - all of which of course failed. When Pratap recovered his strength, he went on offensive and recaptured most of the lost territory from Akbar. Finest moment of Pratap was not Haldi-Ghati but Battle of Diwer when he defeated a larger Mughal army, killing or taking prisoner some 35,000 Mughal troops and swiftly occupying most of Mewar. He goes on to rule his country for 12 years as an independent ruler while all of North India lay at feet of Akbar. ",
