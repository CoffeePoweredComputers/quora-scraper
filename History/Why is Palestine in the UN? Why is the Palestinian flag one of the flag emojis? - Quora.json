            "answer_text": "Palestine is a not fully a UN member, it is only a member of a few institutions such as UNESCO. The Palestinian Liberation Organisation is an observer of the UN and the whole thing is quite complicated. Flag emojis, however, are mostly assigned to places that have top-level domain names, like Canada (.ca) or Israel (.il). Not all of these are countries \u2013 Martinique (.mq), Jersey (.je), the \u00c5land Islands (.ax) and the British Indian Ocean Territory (.io) all have flag emojis. None of these are UN members, and Palestine (.ps) falls into this category. This is mostly determined by ISO 3166, which standardizes the names and abbreviations for countries and territories. Occupied Palestinian Territory was added in 1999, after the Oslo accords, and its name was changed to Palestine in 2013. ",
