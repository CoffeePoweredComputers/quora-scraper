            "answer_text": "The Geographic North pole and the geographic south pole are what they are. They switch they form the axial ends of the axis upon which the Earth rotates. However the Magnetic poles are another matter. As magnets are atracted to opposites what we call the North Magnetic pole is in fact (magnetically speaking) a South Pole. Do NOT confue the Magnetic poles with the Geographic poles. The Magnetic poles are always wondering so their position has to get upgraded . Of late it has been moving so fast that they had to upgrade it\u2019s current position a year early. Hear is what an expert Trevor Nace has to say on the subject (I Quote): \u201cEarth's Magnetic North Pole Has Officially Moved  Trevor Nace \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tSenior Contributor Science Explore More  This map shows the new location of the magnetic North Pole (the white star). NOAA NCEI/CIRES Earth's magnetic North Pole has drifted so fast that authorities have had to officially redefine the location of the magnetic North Pole. The extreme wandering of the North Pole caused increasing concerns over navigation, especially in high latitudes. Earth's magnetic field is known to have wandered and flipped in the geologic past. Earth's magnetic field is a result of spinning molten iron and nickel 1,800 miles below the surface. As the constant flow of molten metals in the outer core changes over time, it alters the external magnetic field. What we've seen in the past hundred years is that the location of the magnetic North Pole has moved northward. That migration of the magnetic North Pole was switched into overdrive in the past few years, causing the pole to rapidly move. The increased speed with which the magnetic North Pole has moved prompted authorities to officially update its location. The official location of the magnetic poles is specified by the World Magnetic Model, which acts as the basis for navigation, communication, GPS, etc. around the globe. The New Location Of Earth's Magnetic North Pole Today In: \t\t\tInnovation On Monday, the World Magnetic Model updated their official location of the magnetic north. The model is typically updated every five years and was last updated in 2015. However, the recent rapid movement of the magnetic north prompted scientists to update the model early. In the recent past, the magnetic North Pole has moved 34 miles a year toward Russia. Just a half-century ago, the magnetic North Pole was wandering about 7 miles each year. Movement of Earth's magnetic pole over time NOAA PROMOTED Earth's magnetic North Pole is quickly moving from the Canadian Arctic toward Russia. The model update ensures the accuracy of work in governmental agencies around the world. Specifically, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the U.S. Forest Service use the magnetic poles in their daily operations from mapping to air traffic control. On a more individual level, smartphones use the magnetic north for GPS location and compass apps. Is Earth's Magnetic Field About To Flip? While the rapid movement of Earth's magnetic North Pole may cause concern over the potential flip of magnetic poles, there is no evidence that such a flip is imminent. Geologists can interpret magnetic minerals in rocks around the world to reveal the history of magnetic reversals on Earth. Earth's magnetic poles have flipped many times in its history, with the latest reversal occurring 780,000 years ago and 183 times in the past 83 million years. When Earth's magnetic poles do flip, it won't be a catastrophic \"end of the world\" scenario. From examining fossil records, there is no evidence that a magnetic field reversal causes increased extinctions, volcanic activity, etc. However, one big issue will lie in the extensive use our technology relies on the magnetic poles. A reversal would upend navigation and communication systems around the globe. Thankfully, a pole reversal in the past typically takes thousands of years to flip. This will give us ample time to develop mitigating plans. In reality, when Earth's magnetic field does flip, who knows what planet our descendants will be living on?

            "answer_text": "Yes it is not only possible but actually it is true. Only IF you write magnetic with any one of it. The true South pole is actually the magnetic north and True North is the magnetic south If you don't have a pole identifier readily available, you can use a little science to find the North pole of your magnets. Your magnet's North pole is attracted to the Earth's North pole. (This is because poles are always attracted to opposite direction - NS or SN) where N is north and S is south. Technically, the Earth is labeled backwards -- the geographic North pole is actually like the magnetic South pole of a magnet. If you hang a small stack of magnets on a long thread, the magnets will freely rotate. Hang up your 3 foot length of string on a stable platform, like an overhead light. Once it stops wobbling, the North end should be pointing North. If you know roughly which direction is North (the sun rises in the East), you'll find your magnet's North pole.  I hope you got the answer ",
