            "answer_text": "Roosevelt play acted when he was in Stalin\u2019s presence by talking down to Churchill as though the two did not like each other very much. Stalin\u2019s knowledge of British-American relations was limited to what his NKVD (the forerunner of the KGB) told him. As a former Russian-Orthodox priest in training, he really wasn\u2019t much of a student of international history. Remember that Roosevelt was an American \u201cliberal\u201d leader and Churchill was the leader of the Conservative Party in Britain. And although neither was anywhere near to being either a communist or a fascist certainly, when the heat was on \u2014 and it was in 1943/44 \u2014 it was easy for Stalin to assume he could drive a wedge between the British and the Americans. Both FDR and Churchill had been raised as boys ensconced in their respective country\u2019s upper class. Roosevelt\u2019s wife Eleanor\u2019s Uncle Theodore had been the great Progressive Reformer who was a minor hero in the Soviet Union since he had presided over the signing of the Portsmouth Treaty which brought to an end the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 that had rubbed Russian Tsar Nicholas\u2019s nose in ignominious defeat at the hands of the relative upstart Japanese. Yet Churchill was also the scion of one the leading families of Great Britain \u2014 his forebear the hero of the Battle of Blenheim. So it was easy for Stalin to assume FDR was, ideologically at least, not much different from his wife\u2019s uncle, and that Mr. Roosevelt might not be pleased with Mr. Churchill. Churchill had spent a lot of time meeting with Roosevelt since becoming Prime Minister. Yet he first noticed at the Casablanca Conference in January, 1943, when the two leaders met with the two warring French Generals, Charles De Gaulle and Henri Giraud, that FDR was rather off-putting towards him in front of the French. Roosevelt had backed Giraud. But Churchill supported De Gaulle (because he thought he could control him said Elliot Roosevelt in his book). But Churchill had wondered if it was merely an act to be able to put the British in their place, particularly later in November when they were both to meet in Tehran with Stalin for the first time. The French had been one thing, but both leaders knew that Stalin might not stop his European invasion at the Elbe River. So their demeanor was all-important and their suspicions were made worse when Stalin begged off at Casablanca and did not attend, citing the Battle of Stalingrad as his reason. For an old war horse Democrat, who had slowly pulled his people out of the deepest mud of the Great Depression, FDR was also a veritable genius when it came to foreign affairs. He definitely played his cards closer to his chest than had Woodrow Wilson in 1919! All of the pre-war, war-time and post-war conferences (26 in all at varying levels of diplomacy) had the collective result of replacing the need for another disastrous Treaty of Versailles! And being a Democrat, FDR was painfully aware of his Republican enemies in congress who charged that although his strong point may have been America\u2019s domestic affairs as a typical left-oriented Democrat, he was probably an amateur when it came to negotiating his way through the worst war in history. After meeting in Tehran ten months later, Roosevelt and Churchill were able to lay the ground work for a new Europe following the war at the Yalta Conference in early 1945. Yes, they had to give up most of the territory then occupied by the Soviets in Eastern Europe. But the point was that they wanted Stalin (who sat there like an old lizard sunning himself on a rock!) to think he was getting something that the Americans and the British may very well be willing to fight over! The final polish was put on it all at the Potsdam Conference after Harry Truman had replaced the deceased FDR, and Clement Attlee was unexpectedly voted in by the British electorate and showed up at Potsdam ready to negotiate at the bargaining table. So the old communist dictator thought he was finally sitting in the catbird\u2019s seat with a couple of rank amateurs at his side. But back in January, 1943, on their way home from the Casablanca Conference that predated both Tehran and Yalta, Roosevelt and Churchill traveled to Marrakech in Morocco. They spent the night at a large villa occupied by the US Vice-Consul there. The next morning, Winston Churchill ordered that Franklin Roosevelt be hand-lifted by British troops up several dozen steps to the top of the tower in the Majorelle Gardens. Churchill had been there with his family before. But he wanted to share this experience with his friend so the two could watch the sun come up behind the Atlas Mountains. fdrlibrary  The photograph (above) of their shared experience is now rather famous. The look on Churchill\u2019s face is unmistakable: He knew by that time that FDR was very ill. The last time they would meet was at Yalta in January, 1945, almost exactly two years later. It has been suggested by others that the decision to play act their roles in front of Stalin was decided the evening before the picture was made. I feel it is one of the most moving photographs in all of history as far as what was at stake in the world at the time \u2014 two little boys, now great world leaders, watching the sun rise behind the Atlas Mountains, East of Marrakech.
