            "answer_text": " The process is the same. Where it might be said to differ is that we are further down the track. Also, in the late 20th century, globalization was presented as an inevitable process. Now the \u2018process\u2019 is recognised as a policy choice that it is. What is an inevitable process is that we are living through a communications revolution. This revolution is having the effect of making the world more integrated and seemingly smaller. One benefit of the communications revolution is that we do not need to go abroad to see what is there, or to communicate with peoples from other countries. Social media allows pictures, posts etc to be shared across the world in seconds. We have \u2018friends\u2019 from other countries we have never met. One important way that 21st century globalization differs is that we can now see the flaws in the anti-nation state policy. We are now in the midst of a second economic crisis within 12 years. The financial crash of 2008, from which the UK economy never recovered (economic growth remained low as did wage growth and hence living standards) was largely due to the reckless risks taken by the financial institutions. The bad debts of foreigners and the insolvency of multinational banks had to be made good by NATIONAL taxpayers. In the UK, the value of private pensions was decimated as a result. In 2020, the Covid-19 depression was the result of a pretence that China is the same as any Western country, a refusal to secure the borders to halt the spread of the pandemic (the UK\u2019s borders have remained wide open, with no tests to check to see if incomers are infected), and the West\u2019s general dependence upon Third World and Chinese suppliers for basic medical resources, which meant that shortages led to very many deaths. In the UK, a recent documentary revealed in the first few minutes that the NHS had war gamed a pandemic and realized that there would be a need for far more PPE. Rather than increase stocks of PPE, they placed a just-in-time order to be delivered in the event of a pandemic \u2013 with a CHINESE company. Seemingly, it never occurred to the NHS that were there to be a pandemic then all countries would be clamouring for PPE and hence the UK needed to be self-sufficient. By trying to save a few quid, the NHS landed the UK with the far greater costs of shortages, hospital admissions, and deaths. Then there are the devastating economic costs of the Covid-19 depression. In the summer of 2020, with protests, the tearing down of statues etc, and the open unrest (encouraged by the MSM) within ethnic minority and immigrant communities across the West \u2013 the UK and the USA in particular \u2013 then the next devastating blow arising from the policy of globalization is already hurtling down the tracks towards us. In the 20th century globalization was an ideal. In the 21st century it is a nightmare. ",

            "answer_text": "The wave of globalization which had started 1850 stopped with World War I until the end of World War II. Triggered by postwar reconstruction the world was entering into a new phase with high growth rates above 8 percent per year in real terms between 1950 and 1973 - when trade growth slowed under the impact of two oil price shocks. Partially driven by the developments in the information technology sector, trade growth picked up again in the 1990s.  The key drivers of globalization in the 20th century have been (1) innovation, e.g. in the logistics sector, resulting in higher speed and lower cost transportation as well as better connectivity, in information and communication technology, and in production methods, leading to the gradual built up of global manufacturing networks (2) political changes, including the Marshall Plan in Europe, China's economic reforms, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and (3) economic policies and international agreements to reduce trade and financial transaction barriers. The 21st century started with a small contraction caused by the dotcom crises. However, exports continued to be high until 2007. Since the onset of the global financial crises world trade volumes have lagged behind GDP growth. While the 20th century globalization drivers have played their role and lost steam, no new innovations significantly driving globalization have occurred so far. The political climate deteriorated resulting in the beginning of a process of disintegration. In addition, customers expect short delivery times which requires to move factories closer to the markets which reduces trade volumes. The 21st century has entered in a phase of re-positioning: politically as well as economically. One of the new forces driving globalization in the 21st century could well be platformization, through players like amazon, alibaba and eBay. ",
