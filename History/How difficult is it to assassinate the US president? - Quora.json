            "answer_text": "It might be impossible on one day at a certain time and location. But over time it could be done. It is the price we pay for living in a free society. The President is like a magnet for fringe groups to target. You have to figure every president has had plots, many that were never discovered. Which is a good indicator really. It shows there aren\u2019t really that many or they aren\u2019t dedicated to the idea. There have been many more attempts that people don\u2019t even know about. But only 4 assassinations. Jackson had two guns pointed at close range at him. Both guns misfired. What are the odds? Jackson beat the man to the ground with his walking stick. Gotta love a man of action that doesn\u2019t need the secret service. LOL! It was said his security staff (I think there were two of them) had to pull the President off the man before he killed him.

            "answer_text": "To be perfectly protected from such threats at all time, a person could never go outside, never travel, and never be around anyone but the most trusted family and aides.And even then, as history has shown, it can still happen.There are novels and movies that take up this theme, but most of them are somewhat implausible.And as you seem to be aware, this is a dangerous area.If you wrote this question in some other countries, about some other world leaders, you might disappear just for asking.Freedom of Speech allows us to ask in this country, but no matter how we feel about the President, we should not want harm to come to them.Maybe it's best to focus on other, less grim questions.I prefer spending mental energy on things that are not as dark.Unless I'm writing a novel, and then the imagination may go places that I normally may not.  But I just can't think of a good story with this premise.Sorry. ",

Reagan was nearly the 5th President to be assassinated by John Hinckley, Jr. in March 1981. US Secret Service protection looked very poor on that occasion. ",
