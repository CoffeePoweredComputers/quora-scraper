            "answer_text": "Modern day Jews are descendants of the twelve tribes. What was lost was not tribal representation (though modern day Jews, aside from those who are Kohen or Levi, generally do not know which tribe they are from, as there is no meaningful difference between, for example, being from the tribe of Judah vs the tribe of Benjamin; we reduce all of these to \u201cIsrael\u201d). Rather, what was lost were the descendants of the Israelites living in the northern Kingdom of Israel who were captured or dispersed by the Assyrians. In the southern Kingdom of Judah, the most prominent tribes were (aside from the Kohanim and Levi\u2019im serving in the Temple), the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. However, following the Assyrian conquest, some Israelites from the northern kingdom fled to the southern kingdom, and thus there were Israelites from all of the tribes present when the Babylonians conquered the southern kingdom, and the group became known as Jews in the Babylonian captivity. That is, modern day Jews come from these various different tribes (albeit with some of the tribes located in the northern Kingdom of Israel less well represented). However, for those who did not flee into the Kingdom of Judah, the Assyrians instituted a program of forced cultural intermixing, assimilation, and dispersal such that those Israelites who were captured were unable to preserve their identity and pass along their national religion and affiliation. It is in this sense that these tribes were lost; i.e. the majority of their members were cut off from the rest of the nation of Israel and their descendants are no longer part of us.

            "answer_text": " The present-day Jews comprise most of the Tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi, along with representative minorities from all the other Tribes. [This is explained by Nachmanides (Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman, 1194-1270) in the \"Book of Redemption.\"] Physical descendants of the other Tribes are assimilated among the Gentiles. They are especially concentrated in the following areas, In some places they may be a minority and in others a substantial proportion. Nevertheless this is where they are as recognizable entities: The British Isles including Ireland and encompassing their offshoots overseas in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa. These include members of all the Tribes but those of Joseph (Ephraim and Manasseh) have the determinating influence. France - the Tribe of Reuben. Switzerland possibly the Tribe of Asher Finland the Tribe of Issachar. Sweden - the Tribe of Gad Norway Tribe of Nathptali Denmark Tribe of Dan. Netherlands Tribe of Zebulon Belgium Benjamin and Asher So too, within the British isles in addition to Ephraim and Manasseh we found elements from Dan, Simeon, and Asher in Ireland. Scotland also contained elements from Asher but in general was dominated by Manasseh, England represented Ephraim. Wales included groups from Manasseh, Dan, and Simeon.   ",
