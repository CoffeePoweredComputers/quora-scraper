            "answer_text": "What\u2019s your threshold for perfect? If you mean how many French people speak English as a second language as well as in certain other places such as in the Nordic countries, then it\u2019s less by a considerable margin. It is far better than it was even just 20 years ago, but you will not encounter as many people who seem practically bilingual as you would in say, Sweden. If you mean how many speak perfectly functional English, good enough to be able to hold a conversation, then quite a lot do nowadays. This is especially true in the younger population and the big cities in general. If you mean perfect as in absolutely flawless native-level English (which by the way, most English speakers would generally not even boast about themselves), then the number is obviously much lower. For that you\u2019d have to count the French people who are truly bilingual because they grew up with English at the same time as French. There are actually more people like this than you might think, but it\u2019s certainly not the norm. So in short, there has been a marked difference in the standard of English as a second language in France in recent years. I\u2019m not aware of any official statistics on this so I can\u2019t really give an actual percentage, but it certainly appears to be the case in my experience. There does not however seem to be anything close to a commensurate level of improvement in second-language proficiency in most English-speaking countries though. In places like the US, it tends to still be the norm that only people with an ethnic background or immigrants from other countries are fluent in another language other than English. ",

People always make mistakes, so \u2026 0% No one, nothing. >>> Unless with \u201cperfect\u201d French, you mean speaking Fluently (general population) Then: let\u2019s say +- 60% speak it fluently out of the 85% that speak it. >>> Unless you mean speaking French, and in a good way, on a professional level !!! The number boils really down to a measly 20%, because most of the French population have it too difficult to write their language properly, which means \u2026 Reading the language is not easy and speaking it well is even more difficult. A lot of the French cannot write their own mother tongue properly !!! ",

Which means that in a big city like Paris or Bordeaux where there are a lot of tourists, the percentage of people speaking English is likely to be much higher but \u201cperfect\u201d might not apply.French upper class does and even send their children to private English schools to make sure they do learn English properly.I train people in English and generally their level is rather low because they are badly taught at school.They come with preconceive ideas and an awful pronunciation. Teaching executives is a different scene altogether and some are proficient but take classes to refresh it. Whatsoever French people do not speak \u201cperfect\u201d English unless they are bilingual. Now the question is: what is the percentage of English people speaking their native language \u201cperfectly\u201d? ",
