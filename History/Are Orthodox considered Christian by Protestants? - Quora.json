            "answer_text": "It depends on which Protestants and what they mean by \u201cChristian\u201d. But generally the answer is yes, members of Orthodox churches are certainly considered Christians. The major ecumenical organization is the World Council of Churches. It has more than 300 WCC member churches, including Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox groups. Member churches must hold to a Trinitarian formulation of the deity so that would preclude certain religious organizations like the Latter Day Saints (Mormons), Jehovah Witnesses, and Unitarian Universalists. Oddly enough the world\u2019s largest Christian church, the Roman Catholic Church, is not a member of the WCC itself though it is a founding member of the WCC\u2019s Faith & Order Commission. As I recall the reasons are not because of disagreement with the theological principles\u2014the RCC is definitely Trinitarian\u2014but has to do with how the WCC fits in with the RCC\u2019s ecumenical goals.

Christian orthodoxy is the fundamentals of the Christian faith: The Trinity, the deity of Christ, Creation by God, the sinful nature of mankind, verbal plenary inspiration of scripture, the blood atonement of Christ, His bodily resurrection on the 3rd day, personal salvation by grace through faith and repentance of sin. We, \u201cProtestants\u201d which does not include New Testament Baptist churches, agree that anyone who preaches and practices these basic beliefs with the same understanding of terminology are Christian.

            "answer_text": "Short answer. Any man made religion is not necessarily Christian. My point is Jesus despised the doctrine of man religious Pharisees of His dats to on earth. Jesus preached and wants a relationship with Him, not doctrine of man, rules, regulations, dogma, etc. He preached about the Kingdom of God, not a man made religious system of works that is found in Roman Catholicism and Orthodox churches. Either grace is free or it is not grace at all. So, only those drawn by God, predestined, His elect, is the Church of Christ and true Christians. There is a definitive dividing line between religion of man and a relationship of and in Christ. In my knowledge Orthodox \u2018churches\u2019 are similar to Catholicism, never having true peace knowing one has eternal life and secure in it thereof. ( 1 John 5:13). ",

In other words, Protestant means not-Roman and not-Orthodox. Consequently, the term Protestant says nothing about what any Protestant thinks or believes about anything. There are Protestants who think that Romans and Orthodox are Christians too. There are Protestants who think one them is authentically Christian but the other not. And, some Protestants think neither Romans nor Orthodox are Christians. Indeed, there are many Protestants who think that their version of Protestantism is the only true Christian faith, and all other Protestants are not Christians! ",
