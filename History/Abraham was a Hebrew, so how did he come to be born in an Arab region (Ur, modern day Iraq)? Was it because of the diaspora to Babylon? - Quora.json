            "answer_text": "Most scholars nowadays think that Abraham is a metaphor for a migration or series of migration out of Ur, not one real person. Obviously if you\u2019re committed to believing the Bible literally, you won\u2019t accept that. But anyway, both in reality, and in a literal reading of the Bible, Abraham came long before the exile (\u201cdiaspora\u201d is the wrong word) to Babylon. He was also before the Jewish race. \u201cHebrew\u201d in that time just meant a \u201cforeigner\u201d. He was the first person to be called that, in the Tanakh (\u201cOld Testament\u201d). So he wasn\u2019t really a \u201cJew\u201d or \u201cIsraelite\u201d. According to the Bible, he was the one with whom God made a covenant, and became the father of the Israelites. \u201cIsrael\u201d was actually the name of his grandson, also called \u201cJacob\u201d. So the foundation myth - or, if you will, the truth in the Bible - is that Abraham left the Ur of the Chaldeas, and travelled across to the Levant, where the \u201cPromised Land\u201d was. Then his great-grandson Joseph, and later Joseph\u2019s brothers and father, migrated to Egypt, and there they developed into a race, as slaves under the Egyptians. Then after 300-something years they escaped, wandered around in the desert for 40 years, and slaughtered all the Canaanites and took the land which God had given them. Then there was the nation of Israel, for hundreds of years (well, split into two kingdoms) and then the Babylonian exile. That\u2019s a brief overview of the story. So Abraham was well before the exile, and while he\u2019s referred to as a \u201cHebrew\u201d, he\u2019s the father of the Jewish nation, which didn\u2019t exist yet when he was born, because he was the patriarch of it. It is a strange sort of throwback that the story ends (kind of ) back in the same region where it started. ",

            "answer_text": "Because Abraham and his family were Amorites, and thus part of the group that entered Iraq and caused the downfall of the Sumerian dynasty - the original one. The Amorite tribes of which his father were a part, came to Iraq from Syria, and thus his brother Haran, is named after an Amorite-nfluenced town just to the north of modern Syria in the Anatolia peninsula. Hammurabi was an Amorite, for example, and probably Abram and his tribes left when the Hittites entered. And Abram was not a Hebrew - that term was not used until they entered the Canaanite area. He then became the father of the tribe that lived in the Levant and were called the Abiru, Hibiru, Ibiru, and other names by the Egyptians and others. They were wandering sheep drovers, sometimes called thieves as well by their neighbors, but I\u2019m sure that part is just evil slander, right? I can give you some examples of what the Amorites introduced when they swarmed into Sumeria; interest on notes, where previously there was no such thing, an eye-for-an-eye type of justice, when previously only fines applied to most wrongdoings, and the idea that women, who held positions of power and were even goddesses in Sumerian history, were relegated to the level of dogs.

            "answer_text": "Abraham was the first Hebrew (Genesis 14:13), the first of the lineage. His brother Nahor settled in Syria, and his son Bethuel had at least two children, Rebekah and Laban. Both Laban and his father Bethuel are referred to as \u201cSyrian\u201d (Gen. 25:20; 28:5; 31:20, 24). Considering that Abraham is the father of the modern-day \u201cArabs\u201d (Ishmael), the ancient demographics of Ur aren\u2019t really assessable. The diaspora wasn\u2019t until centuries later as well. The lineage goes like this: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob/Israel; his twelve sons became the patriarchs/tribes of Israel. Forty years after God called them out of Egypt, they took possession of Canaan, then a few hundred years later wound up with wicked kings and got exported to Babylon/Persia. Egypt too, but that\u2019s later. Abraham was a Hebrew because he was the first Hebrew, not because he was born into a Hebrew lineage. ",
