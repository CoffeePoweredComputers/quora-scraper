Similarly, the Vikings seem to have targeted monasteries because that was where the valuables were\u2014nothing personal. in my studies on English history and Old or Middle English chronicles and literature, the English consider the Vikings as savages and sometimes attribute them to divine punishment, but I\u2019m not aware of the Vikings having any fundamental hatred for Christians. Even in the saint\u2019s lives stories where priests are killed, the Vikings are interested in fast loot and female Irish slaves to kidnap. In Aelfric\u2019s life of St. Edmund the Vikings are \u201cpagans,\u201d and they chop King Edmund\u2019s head off because he won\u2019t submit and pay them\u2014they don\u2019t particularly care about his faith. Remember also that when the Vikings finally stayed in northeastern England, they became Christians, and some were already. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think at first they singled them out - Christians just happened to concentrate their gold in monasteries full of unarmed, non-martial men. From a viking perspective this was incredibly foolish (and probably somewhat confusing), but they took advantage of it while they could. When they could no longer do so, many vikings (like Rollo in Normandy) converted to Christianity to better solidify their monarchical claims or engage in diplomacy with Catholic rulers. At this point, some Norse individuals surely hated Christians a great deal, for essentially \u2018conquering\u2019 their leaders culturally without beating them in battle. Imagine how frustrating to spend decades or even centuries winning battles and pillaging people, only to have your leaders abandon the gods who gave you so much victory and adopt the God of the same people you\u2019ve been pillaging!
