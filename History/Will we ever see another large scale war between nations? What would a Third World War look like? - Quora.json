            "answer_text": "I have read comments that we are experiencing WW III as we speak. Its just that style of war has changed to smaller and more localised events. Keep in mind that since WW II we have never had world peace. There has always been small insurrections, the occasional coup d'\u00e9tat in place of an election, the usual border disputes and of course Pax Americana to keep the pot bubbling along. Now, if you mean what if we had a war equivalent in size and numbers as WW II it would be what is known as a \"come as you are\" war. This means, whatever you have on hand will likely be all that you will have to fight with. With the technology we depend on today, the idea of cranking out a U-boat in less than a year is not going to happen let alone a battleship or a fleet of bombers etc. One of the issues that plagued the US during their sojourn in the Middle East was that they depleted their stock piles of ordinance so fast it got to be tricky at times.  Now, that would be if we stayed in a conventional war, so I guess about a year or two at best if it were all out. But, given the world today, it would be simply a larger more drawn out affair that would allow industry to re-supply some needs. Now, if we trip into nuclear confrontation which would occur about 15 minutes before a nuclear armed country was to lose their war, I figure about two hours or slightly more. It takes about 1/2 an hour for the average ICBM to travel halfway around the world. Then you have the automatic retaliation systems and then you have what \"Dooms Day\" device that may be ready to go. In North Korea's case, a large box of Chinese manufactured fire crackers. (Sorry, but I have a very low regard for North Korea and their chubby leader) It would be short and nasty. Who would \"win\". I suggest the US would come out on top, eventually. They are about the best equipped to come back from a confrontation of this magnitude. Russia and China have systems in place that are held together by individual personalities supporting each other. Kill one or two and things start going south in a hurry. The US can quite easily get along without their federal leaders and as a society are used to working together although they may fight like cats and dogs around the Thanksgiving Dinner. ",

            "answer_text": "Highly unlikely in terms of a conventional conflict. Armies are getting smaller and smaller now and more reliance is being put in quality over quantity. Even mass conscription is slowly starting to fall by the wayside. One of the problems with having any major war such as the scenario you are asking about is that after a short period of time, maybe 30\u201360 days, nations are going to be affected by ammunition shortages. This is from the end of 2015 The U.S. is running out of bombs to drop on ISIS Pentagon Running Low on Smart Bombs for ISIS Campaign Defense Leaders Warn of Tomahawk Missile Shortage Now, we are supplying pretty much the entire coalition of their ordance, including much of what the KSA is using in Yemen. But we're also not exactly running high tempo operations either. Especially not the tempi one would expect in a major, prolonged conventional scenario. Now, smaller ammo, from bullets to tankand artillery rounds have a seemingly infinite supply, but the reserve weapon systems themselvea dont. A lot is made abput the \u201cboneyards\u201d of stored aircraft but a lot of them can never be flown again and the ones that can be would take months to get into deployable condition. The same can be said for naval forces. The naval reserve fleet has dramatically declined and some ships, like the 2 carriers it now holds, probably couldnt conduct operations again without major overhauls or rebuilds. Only in land forces do the major powers have significant backstock of vehiclea and weapons. The US has around 15,000 M-1 & M-60 MBTs while Russia may have over 50,000. So barring some unsean event, its tough to see any war involving major powers lasting long as well as not going nuclear. ",
