            "answer_text": "Before I answer this question I need to say that to me The Divine (so a rather broad and even universal reference) is not a politician looking for a general advantage in a public election. To me He is not dependent on what some human (or group of humans) may record as His specific activity. And because a human can discuss an historical event and its record, and even regard it as a somewhat delicate issue, it need have no impact on belief. My preamble over, my reasonably defensible view is that the Old Testament account was formed, or assembled, at least in its shape as we have it today, during and probably also for another century after, the 6th century BCE. It came from an Israelite tribe, Judah, who had been exiled to Babylon and in that situation, I believe, had an intense consciousness of how The Lord had brought them to freedom out of a similar situation in a past recalled in tribal traditions. Judah had its own traditions, but so had other tribes of which they were aware, and it is not unlikely that in time they had influenced each other. So out of the tribe of Judah alone came a fairly coherent story, gathered up in some part from many others, of what they called The Exodus. This was formed into a single account of an experience of escape from Exile during that of living in another Exile, reflected in its final version during Judah\u2019s escape from it and its return to Jerusalem. The coincidence of such circumstances cannot be without relevance. So the account we have of The Exodus is a distillation of many traditions, both of Judah and of the other tribes of Israel, of which all figures of authority had been exiled from their land around a century before the same had been inflicted on Judah. Who can say how many centuries those traditions had been passed on for, or even if they were not wholly different traditions, perhaps steadily merged, held in memories of similar experiences of maybe a dozen or more different Canaanite tribes? Given all my anxieties, who can say \u2018What Pharaoh was the one who was involved?\u2019 I am sure enough that no particular event can, or need, be identified. My judgement is that what the account in the Old Testament does is to proclaim that, declared in in all those possible traditions, God cares enough to bring His People out of Exile into a state of peace and new beginnings. Whoever they are, whenever, wherever and however they find themselves in need. To me the most significant line in the narrative is where Moses, at the Burning Bush (Exodus 3:14), asks God for his Name, and, it you translate the Hebrew sufficiently carefully, God says \u2018I am what I am becoming\u2019 (\u05d0\u05b6\u05bd\u05d4\u05b0\u05d9\u05b6\u0596\u05d4 \u05d0\u05b2\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05a3\u05e8 \u05d0\u05b6\u05bd\u05d4\u05b0\u05d9\u05b6\u0591\u05d4 for the technically inclined). God is a God of the future, of the unfinished, not of a however-valuable past. Worrying about the name of a Pharaoh is an irrelevant clutter. \u05b6 ",

            "answer_text": "I have to say that there are many different answers to this question and no one (at present) can be sure who was the Pharaoh of the Exodus. A very big part of the reason for this being the inherent inaccuracies within ancient Egyptian chronology. Most scholars would be happy to allow adjustments of up to half-a-century (maybe up to a century) either way. However, there are those who wish to change Egyptian chronology by many hundreds of years (most consider them a little over-enthusiastic). Still, you can see the challenges here. However, most Biblical maximalists (such as myself) would be happy to narrow the quest for this Pharaoh to the early part of the 18th Dynasty. Not only is \u201cMoses\u201d a popular name in this period but it is also possible to find points where the Biblical & the known accounts of a number of these early 18th Dynasty Pharaohs match nicely. Also, a number of Egyptian mythologies changed shortly after this time, reflecting the reality of what the Bible describes.[As a Biblical maximalist I do not subscribe to the idea of a 13th century Exodus. Also, there is too much internal Biblical evidence to accept a late date (as another answer suggests) for writing the Exodus account - the first five books of the Bible were obviously written close to the time of these events (i.e. 15th century BCE).] ",
