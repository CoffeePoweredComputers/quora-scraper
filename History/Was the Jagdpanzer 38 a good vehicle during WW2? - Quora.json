            "answer_text": "Amongst circles of amateur historians, there is a continuously weakening myth that the iconic German tanks of the World War Two were supreme. Incomparably superior to all others. As I do with all things unrooted in truth, I am a supporter of the efforts to dismantle this myth. However, I cannot help but frown in distaste and wonder about if I am benefiting the truth at all, as I see my fellow enthusiasts roll over the far edge claiming that how the cheaper German tanks were all needed to win the war and how it was an imbecilic mistake to even design the famous big cats. When the topic of the discussion is Hetzer, I often can sniff a distasteful waft of the same attitude. The Hetzer, or with its official designation Jagdpanzer 38, was a fairly good vehicle. Just good. Nothing more, nothing less.  Jagdpanzer 38 \u2018Hetzer\u2019 of the 8. SS-Kavallerie-Division Florian Geyer, Hungary, 1944 At the start of the war, the German tank destroyer doctrine was just a method to give mobile AT support to motorized units. For this reason, the initial tank destroyers, the Panzerj\u00e4ger, were just an AT gun mounted on an usually obsolete chassis, with an open casemate and a fixed gun mount. The first of the class was Panzerj\u00e4ger I, mounting a 47mm Czech AT gun on a Panzer I chassis.  What had begun with that six ton midget ended finally with the monolithic Panzerj\u00e4ger Tiger (P) \u2018Ferdinand\u2019, more than ten times heavier than Panzerj\u00e4ger I:  However, with the exception of the monolithic Ferdinand, all of the Panzerj\u00e4ger units had been lightly armored vehicles with partially exposed crew compartments, from the Panzerj\u00e4ger I to the dreaded Nashorn. Experiences with Sturmgesch\u00fctz III assault gun, for years being used as a casemate tank destroyer or even a pseudo-tank by that point, directed the Heereswaffenamt to a new design philosophy. The new tank destroyers would have a fully enclosed and armored casemate with a forward-fixed gun, and would be more heavily armored than most of the preceding designs. The Jagdpanzer concept was born. Designed as a light tank destroyer easier and cheaper to produce than the larger versions of that class, the Jagdpanzer IV and the Jagdpanther, Jagdpanzer 38 was essentially a lightweight StuG III. Weighing at just fifteen tons the Hetzer was light, and this allowed it to maintain a good top speed of 40 km/h with a noticeably smaller engine. It packed good punch with a 75mm Pak 39 L/48, and at the front was fairly well armored with 60mm steel plate sloped at 60 degrees. It was a fairly reliable and sturdy vehicle as well. But all these qualities came at many disadvantages. Hetzer was a very un-German vehicle, very cramped and unpleasant for the crew in stark contrast with the spacious and ergonomic larger tanks. The commander was mostly isolated from the rest of the crew, and the loader had to sit on the left of the gun, despite the Pak 39 being designed to be loaded from the right and the bulk of the ammo storage being right of the main gun. Worse, a buttoned-up Hetzer was essentially blind from the right. It had a measly ammunition capability of 41 rounds, and it had greatly cut down on rear and side armor: the side armor was an unhelpful 20 mm, and the rear and roof was covered with 8 mm steel plate that might\u2019ve as well not been there at all for anything bigger than rifle rounds. Built on the Czech Panzer 38(t) chassis, it used a leaf spring suspension instead of a sturdier torsion bar. Ultimately, the Hetzer\u2019s greatest quality was being based on the Czech Panzer 38(t), which meant it could be manufactured at the otherwise increasingly redundant B\u00f6hmisch-M\u00e4hrische Maschinenfabrik AG plant at Pilsen, Bohemia, without cutting into established production lines. Hetzer, especially as an ambush predator, was a very good vehicle, yes. But it was not good enough to overtake established tank, assault gun and tank destroyer designs. If it were not for the Skoda plants, Hetzer would probably never see production. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWas the Jagdpanzer 38 a good vehicle during WW2?\u201d It was pretty good. Not great. It served on after WW2 in the Swiss army as the G-13 so there\u2019s that. Advantages: fast and mobilegun capable of penetrating most enemy tankssmall and easily camouflagedcheap to make using obsolete chassisdecent frontal armor (60mm heavily sloped at 60 degrees)relatively reliableDisadvantages: terrible ergonomicspoor visibility (blind on the right side)poor side armor (20mmpoor field of fireTo expand on the disadvantages, here is a pic of the interior of a Jgdpz 38(t)  In front we have the driver, followed by the gunner and loader. The commander is on the other side isolated from the rest of the crew. Here is another view:  The commander is in that alcove by the engine. So the first issue is that the commander is isolated from the rest of the crew and has some difficulty communicating and coordinating. The next issue is that the loader is on the left side of the gun. This meant he had to lift the shells with his left hand for loading. In addition, the gun was the standard 75mm pak39 which was designed to be loaded from the right. Next the ammunition is mostly stored on the right side of the tank. Some is on the left side, near the loader, but most is on the right:   (note: this image has the crew slightly off but it does show the ammunition on the right wall) Finally, the gun was mounted offset to the right side. This meant that while it could aim up to 11 degrees to the right, it could only traverse 5 degrees to the left. This made it very difficult to track moving targets, especially at close range. These disadvantages were serious, but could be minimized by tactical usage; the Jgdpz 39(t) was an ambush predator. In well prepared, camouflaged positions overlooking a road or bridge, it didn\u2019t matter that the communications were poor or traverse was minimal. The crew knew what to do and the enemy was in a small area. After firing a couple of rounds, the vehicle would quickly relocate to a different firing position. Thus it didn\u2019t matter as much that the loader was slowed by the poor ergonomics. He only had to reload a couple of times before he could rest while relocating. At the next hide, he could crawl under the gun to get the ammunition on the right side and store it in his ready rack on the left. Of course, these tactics are only of use on the defense, but in 1944\u20131945, that was where Germany was at. ",
