            "answer_text": "George, Leah and John have helpful factual answers. But \u2026 could we go back to the classroom for a short history lesson, maybe. Please? World War 1 pretty much put an end to the bizarre relic of the medieval past known as dynastic houses, kingdoms, empires. Good riddance. Excuse me? You think we should still have such foppy anachronistic and largely random \u201cnoble\u201d houses and families endowed with ACTUAL power? Hereditary rule makes it easy for them to act selfishly, cruelly, viciously. It is expected - in-breeding does create some deviant rulers as history shows. OK, I am a Dane, ostensibly a subject of Her Majesty. Look I adore their efforts to keep tradition going, my Dad got an \u201conly-while-alive\u201d knighthood from her, my brother in law worked in the lithography studio with her, they know her as Daisy. But God how gauche this tedious ritual looks at to an outsider. Get a life, Daisy.  But yo, get over it. Almost all royals trace their roots to some murderer, thief, child molester or wastrel. The Meiji government needed a modern looking figurehead and the vigorous outdoorsy Meiji fit that role to a T. The next in line was generally considered incapable of ruling and the one we know as Hirohito got caught up in VERY MODERN issues, likely beyond his educational brief. What powers might the Emperor of Japan have today? Pick a prime minister and cabinet? Not likely to be popular with the professional politicians or the populace. Pick athlete of the year. Sure but why the Emperor? There are book awards in his name, my Japanese very academic friend got one. Seriously why should we entrust matters of state to people whose only virtue is genetic, ie. born into a family. Does that give you confidence? History is replete with dynastic disasters. Do you think Donald Junior should one day inherit his Father\u2019s mess? Oh, thanks I agree, but not his political office. Peter Fuchs \u00a9 2018 ",

            "answer_text": "Never had much political power, but after the Meiji restoration in 1868, they built a massive cult of personality based around the Emperor (a la Stalin, the North Korean Kims etc.). At the end of the war this backfired big time; I interviewed many old soldiers in Japan in the 90\u2019s. Most of them stated they despised the Emperor then, that the Emperor had cost them the lives of friends and family and deceived them and led them to destruction. I suspect that if Japan had not been occupied by the Allies at the end of the war that the Emperor would not have survived; it was only through the good graces of the Allies that he wasn\u2019t hung from the nearest post.
