            "answer_text": "Catholicism and Islam are more similar than you think. In fact, Mohammed\u2019s first wife Khadija was supposed be a Catholic. And there are a number of similarities between these faiths. The idea that Mary was sinless, prayer beads, prayer repetitions and pilgrimages. The shrine of Fatima, was named after one of Prophet Mohammad\u2019s daughters. Look at how Muslim women dress versus Catholic nuns. The incorporation of the moon and its symbol in Islam, versus the Sun and its symbolism in Catholicism. Often conversion is to Protestism because its faith is based on biblical truth, God\u2019s word. Mary was not sinless, as she referred to her Son as her Saviour. Furthermore, she was born from the human race which all inherited the imperfect DNA of Adam and Eve. The Bible tells us to not pray with vain repetitions, furthermore salvation comes only through Jesus and not by deeds or sacrements to get to heaven. The HS guides us to truth, which is only found in the word of God, the Bible. Both Islam and Catholicism have over 1 billion followers each. However, the Bible states \u201cBut small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.\u201d Matthew 7:14 ",

I hear about Muslims converting to Catholicism more than I hear about them converting to Protestantism, but I am Catholic, and more likely to listen to Catholic radio, or read Catholic publications. I can\u2019t say how skewed my viewpoint (or yours) may be without seeing actual figures. I would assume that it depends on where the Muslims in question live, and whether they have more exposure to Protestant Christianity or to Catholicism. ",
