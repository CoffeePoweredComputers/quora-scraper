            "answer_text": "Original question: What are some of the parallels between Hitler's Weimar Republic and the rise of Nazism and the current administration in the US? One supposes that Quora is an intellectual forum. If one wishes to cloak insinuating Godwin's law into a discussion, at least use accurate historical references. There was a time when this was actually taught in school. The Weimar Republic wasn\u2019t Hitler\u2019s. The party was the National Socialist German Worker\u2019s Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei) - shortened to \u201cNazi\u201d by everyone but party members themselves. Nazism grew in Germany due to a number of circumstances, none of which are extant in the US. It started to grow during the extreme difficulties of the early 1920\u2019s, when many Germans were at the brink of starvation and were still trying to recover from the effects of the First World War and most significantly the blockade. The reparations demanded by the Allies were onerous, and meant that the hard currency normally used to buy foodstuffs and raw materials was partially lost. The Nazi Party 25 points were either antisemitic or socialist. The Nazi Party was expansionist territoriality, the US threw out the regime-change cabal in 2016. Ergo: there is absolutely nothing of even faint resemblance between Germany in the 1920\u2019s and early 30\u2019s and the US today, except in the minds of some people. ",

            "answer_text": "There are none, and there was no \u201cHitler\u2019s Weimar Republic\u201d.. The Weimar Republic was a failed attempt to created a republican form of Government in Germany between the world wars. The rise of Hitler\u2019s National Socialist Party was the last nail in the Republic\u2019s coffin. Germany never had a history of democracy in any form. That is never as in going back to the Dark Ages. The US had a history of democratic government going back before the Revolution. It continues to this day. If we were in a country like Nazi Germany the officials Trump recently fired would have been secretly executed months ago. Impeachment of the head of the nation in Nazi Germany was a concept no one would even think of in Hitler\u2019s Germany. Anyone who expressed such an idea would have become intimately familiar with the stretching qualities of piano wire. I fail to understand how someone would attempt to whitewash one of, if not the most, evil region in the world from any time in history by comparing anything in the history of the United States to it.
