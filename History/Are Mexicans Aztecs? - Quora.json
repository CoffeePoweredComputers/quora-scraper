            "answer_text": "Are you referring to all Mexicans? No. Keep in mind that there are over 60 tribes in Mexico alone. Each with different customs and different languages although some tribes may share the same language or regional dialects as well as shamanic rites. As to the Aztec part\u2026 If a Mexican person speaks the Nahuatl, and around the culture, sure. They can claim Aztec. However they go by the term Nahua not Aztec or Mexica anymore. If a Mexican doesn't speak Nahuatl, but grew up around the Indigenous culture with food, dances, traditional dresses, oral stories, including religion, then sure again, they are Aztec regardless of DNA percentage or language skills as that is their culture for generations. If however they did not grow up with all of these things even if they physically look Nahua, but they know or heard they have distant Native or Nahua ancestry, then no - they are not Aztec. They should not check the Native American box on the census or college applications without first acknowledging one thing\u2026 The majority of Mexicans are Mestizo, meaning of mixed ancestry of Native and European (mainly Spanish), then you have enslaved Africans who in the beginning worked for Spain against the Aztec empire to gain their freedom back then you have free blacks/Arabs and Jews who were recently forced to convert to Christianity after Spain expelled Islam from their homeland and reclaimed their land from the Muslim Moors the same year that Columbus sailded to the New World. Making the third Mexican race traces of African and Arab/ North African. Then theirs Mexico's 500 year old history. In all of that time slaves imported from Africa and other slaves (of any color during the age of pirates and mass kidnappings all over the world) and other immigrants made Mexico their home. We are a multicultural nation and that lives in the majority of Mexicans today. Sure, the US is a melting pot but everyone looks different. In Mexico, mixture gives you a certain face which is why people tell me I don't look what they consider to be Mexican. As of what to put on the census or college applications?\u2026 Their best bet is to identify as \u201cLatino/Hispanic\u201d - Mexican first. Then when they are asked for their race, check \u201cWhite\u201d for Spanish, \u201cNative' for Nahua or whatever tribe they think they may have ancestry from. Lastly check \u201csome other race\u201d and simply put Mestizo. I HOPE THIS HELPS! ",

            "answer_text": "Are Mexicans Aztecs? No, those are two different things. Mexicans are people who either: By birth: a) Were born in the territory of the Estados Unidos Mexicanos (that is Mexico).b) Were born anywhere AND either his/her father or his/her mother (or both) are Mexican alreadyc) Those born in any Mexican flagged vessel.By naturalization: a) Those who obtain the required naturalization letter from the Mexican government that confers them a status of : \u201cMexican\u201d.b) Those who marry an already Mexican and who establish their residency in Mexican territory as well as complying with other official requirements.This is all contained in the Mexican Constitution, article 30. Regarding AZTECS: The term must be clearly defined as there are many contexts on which the term has been used.. Wikipedia has a very good definition section on the article: Aztec DEFINITIONS: Aztec People: When used to describe ethnic groups, the term \"Aztec\" refers to several Nahuatl speaking peoples of central Mexico in the postclassic period of Mesoamerican chronology, especially the Mexica, the ethnic group that had a leading role in establishing the hegemonic empire based at Tenochtitlan. The term extends to further ethnic groups associated with the Aztec empire such as the Acolhua and Tepanec and others that were incorporated into the empire. In older usage the term was commonly used about modern Nahuatl speaking ethnic groups, as Nahuatl was previously referred to as the \"Aztec language\". In recent usage these ethnic groups are rather referred to as the Nahua peoples. Linguistically the term \"Aztecan\" is still used about the branch of the Uto-Aztecan languages (also sometimes called the yuto-nahuan languages) that includes the Nahuatl language and its closest relatives Pochutec and Pipil. To the Aztecs themselves the word \"aztec\" was not an endonym for any particular ethnic group. Rather it was an umbrella term used to refer to several ethnic groups, not all of them Nahuatl speaking, that claimed heritage from the mythic place of origin, Aztlan. In the Nahuatl language \"aztecatl\" means \"person from Aztlan\". In 1810 Alexander von Humboldtoriginated the modern usage of \"Aztec\" as a collective term applied to all the people linked by trade, custom, religion, and language to the Mexica state and the Triple Alliance. In 1843, with the publication of the work of William H. Prescott, the term was adopted by most of the world, including 19th century Mexican scholars who saw it as a way to distinguish present-day Mexicans from pre-conquest Mexicans. This usage has been the subject of debate in more recent years, but the term \"Aztec\" is still more common. Aztec culture Aztec culture is the culture of the people referred to as Aztecs, but since all ethnic groups of central Mexico in the postclassic period shared most basic cultural traits, Many of the basic traits of Aztec culture cannot be said to be exclusive to the Aztecs. For the same reason the notion of \"Aztec civilization\" is best understood as a particular horizon of a generalMesoamerican civilization. The culture of central Mexico includes maize cultivation, the social division between noble pipiltin and macehualli commoners, a pantheon (featuring Tezcatlipoca, Tlaloc and Quetzalcoatl), and the calendric system of a xiuhpohualli of 365 days intercalated with a tonalpohualli of 260 days. Particular to the Aztecs of Tenochtitlan was the Mexica patron God Huitzilopochtli, twin pyramids, and the ceramic ware known as Aztec I to III. Aztec Empire The maximal extent of the Aztec Empire The Aztec Empire was a tribute empire based in Tenochtitlan that extended its power throughout Mesoamerica in the late postclassic period. It originated in 1427 as a triple-alliance between the city-statesTenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan, who allied to defeat the Tepanecstate of Azcapotzalco, which had previously dominated the Basin of Mexico. Soon Texcoco and Tlacopan became junior partners in the alliance, which was de facto led by the Mexica of Tenochtitlan. The empire extended its power by a combination of trade and military conquest. It was never a true territorial empire controlling a territory by large military garrisons in conquered provinces, but rather controlled its client states primarily by installing friendly rulers in conquered cities, by constructing marriage alliances between the ruling dynasties, and by extending an imperial ideology to its client states. Client states paid tribute to the Aztec emperor, the Huey Tlatoani, in an economic strategy limiting communication and trade between outlying polities, making them dependent on the imperial center for the acquisition of luxury goods. The political clout of the empire reached far south into Mesoamerica conquering cities as far south as Chiapas and Guatemala and spanning from the Pacific to the Atlantic oceans. The empire reached its maximal extent in 1519 just prior to the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors led by Cort\u00e9s who managed to topple the Aztec empire by allying with some of the traditional enemies of the Aztecs, the Nahuatl speaking Tlaxcalteca.  Now, for instance, I am Mexican. I was born in Mexico City, but, due to my ancestry I can not be considered of Aztec ethnicity, therefore you can not say I am Aztec. Regarding people born in Mexico with ancestors belonging to the ancient Aztec people or even with strong Aztec culture, then, yes, you can say that those persons are of AZTEC culture or, with AZTEC heritage. I don\u2019t think that you could say that there are \u201cpure Aztecs\u201d nowadays. Cultures and people have already intermixed \u2026 While there are still indigenous groups, they do not refer to themselves as \u201cAztecs\u201d, they use other denominations: Nahuatl, Yucatec, Mixtec, to name a few. All at the end are Mexicans (as they are in the territory of Mexico) but, none of them are Aztecs. I also think that the term Aztec is used worldwide, and some times in a offensive way, to refer to Mexican, as a a synonym, but, of course, that is incorrect and, as I said, sometimes insulting. ",

            "answer_text": "No. There is a 300 year span of difference between the fall of Tenochtitlan and the fundation of Mexico. And Aztecs were just one tribe of many in what's today called Mexico. Even if Spaniards exaggerated on what they saw to justify their invasion, the Aztecs were a torment for other mesoamerican tribes who were force to pay different kinds of tributes to them. They were probably the most blood thirsty society of the time, their sacrifices involved not only captured warriors but also children executed by intentionally brutal killing methods, \"It was considered a good omen if the victim cried a lot at the time of sacrifice\u201d. It wasn\u2019t difficult for Cort\u00e9z to gather allies, the Aztecs were generally unliked by their neighbours.  So the spanish decided to bring down the Aztecs, and began with the Massacre of Cholula and afterwards the massacre in the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan. Along with all the skirmishes, came hunger and diseases like mumps, measles and smallpox which decimated the local population. The Aztec army overwhelmed the Spanish at first, the initial spanish attack wave had been repelled, killing many and causing the rest to retreat. But amongst the spanish, some where infected. Natives had no defense against this, they had no idea what it was or how to treat it. Entire families died. With no time to bury so many corpses, houses were simply demolished over the bodies. 25% of the empire is said to have been lost to diseases alone. Including an emperor, Cuitl\u00e1huac.  In 1521 the last Aztec emperor, Cuauht\u00e9moc, surrendered to Cort\u00e9z. 12 years later, it was the Incas turn to go. Contemporary mexicans are not able to claim that we have pure aztec blood because, aside from the fact that they were nearly totally wiped out, there have been so many generations of mixing our genes with european conquistadores, the slaves they brought, also nordic and as asian inmigrants, etc. ",

Actually, aztecs (also knows as \u201cmexicas\u201d ) is the name given for the culture and people of a political state who had the city of Mexico-Tenochtitl\u00e1n as the capital; in that perspective aztecs \u201cper s\u00e9\u201d are actually extinct. The people remaining as the descendantes of the aztecs are the nahuas, which are actually a big familiy of peoples living in different parts of Mexico, mainly in central Mexico. However, millions of Mexicans are partially descendants from mexicas, since most mexicans are mestizos; that it, is the mix of american indian and spanish. Indeed, there were (and there still are) many other original mexican etnias, not only nahuas or mayas, for example, zapotecas, mixtecas, totonacas, pur\u00e9pechas, otom\u00edes, wirr\u00e1rikas, etc, etc. and many of them still subsist as a \u201cpure etnia\u201d but an important part of indians from Mexico mixed in the last five centuries. Actually most part of mexicans are partially descendants of one of those etnias. Also part of the \u201cmexican mix\u201d, are in a much small number, descendants of african migrants (in the colonial period), or later migrants, from other countries: syrio-libanese, frenchs, german, jews, japanese\u2026etc. ",

In those regions where their lands where, it\u2019s where most of mestizaje ocurred, and thus, our ancestors come from different precolumbian peoples. For instance, myself, I come from a white spaniard grandfather, a mestizo grandfather (from Yucat\u00e1n, so our indigenous ancestors where probably mayan), a grandmother of mestizo origin (Yucatecan, so most likely spanish and mayan again), and a grandmother of mulatto ancestry (Black and Olmec). There are mexicans of all colours and origins, and Aztec ancestry, while being predominant in the centre of Mexico (and being the number one indigenous current group) is hardly the norm. ",
