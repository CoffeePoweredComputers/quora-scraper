            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not Spanish, nor am I Muslim, but I can say this for those who are confused why this question was asked in the first place: There was a long period of time when most of the Iberian peninsula, Portugal and Spain, was ruled by Muslims, starting with Al-Andalus and the Moors during the Umayyad caliphate of the 8th century (note the Arabic wiki page for this article is starred, which may suggest Arabs are quite proud of this period in their history). And various parts of Spain (and even Italy) were ruled by Muslims for nearly a millennia from 711 to 1492, up until Christopher Columbus sailed to the Americas. In English, this period of time is also known as the Reconquista as Christians were trying to reconquer the peninsula from the Muslims\u2014but it took a very long time! (Also note that as of now, the wiki page for this has no entry in Arabic, maybe because some may not think it was a \u2018reconquering\u2019 if it belonged to them for such a long time.) Understandably, since Spanish Christians spent so much time fighting to win the peninsula from the Muslims, they are not going to give it up easily anytime soon, in the next 100 or even 1000 years. The border between Spain and the Arab world across the Strait of Gibraltar seems to be one of the most security-monitored and patrolled places in the world (The Merits and Limitations of Spain's High-Tech Border Control). And given decades of Islamic terrorism in Europe from the 2004 Madrid bombings to the 2015 Paris attacks, Europe really seems to care a lot about preventing Muslims from ever invading them again. Some Islamic terror groups might even try to justify their attacks by saying that the Iberian peninsula has historically belonged to Muslims (even though Spain was also part of the Roman Empire long before Al-Andalus). As others have mentioned, this is part of the reason for the divide in Europe to accept Muslim refugees from war-torn places like Syria. This kind of xenophobia and rivalry between Christianity and Islam goes back more than a thousand years ago. [This is just my understanding of the history of the situation, so feel free to offer corrections where merited.] ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I think never. Most people in Spain are non-practicing Catholics (catholics just by name) or plain Atheists. That\u2019s the real trend, and is a very, very strong one. More worrying than Islam, which is mostly confined to immigrants that already had that religion (and with very limited success in second-generation immigrants, which are mostly atheists), is the raise in Evangelical Christians, a much more damaging influence. Luckily this also restricts mostly to south-american immigrants, and while it have a bit of a stronger effect in second generation immigrants, is still losing by much to atheism. Today Spain, by numbers (if, luckily, not by politics), is a catholic country; but in little time will be more of an atheist country. I think the Islamic Spain is not in the cards at all. ",
