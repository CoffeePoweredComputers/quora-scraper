            "answer_text": "There are plenty of black Jews! Have you ever heard of Sammy Davis Junior?I thinks it's fair to say that there are two types of black Jews. Some black Jews are born into Judaism, while others convert.There is a community of Jews that are Ethiopian. The story behind Ethiopian Jews is that the son of King Solomon (a Jewish King, in case you didn't know) and the Queen of Sheba (Sheba is in modern day Ethiopia) lived in Ethiopia and spread Judaism. Another possible explanation for Ethiopian Jews is Jewish migrants that traveled through Egypt. For one reason or another, the migrants had to leave, and some went to the land that it is now Ethiopia.Other black Jews are converts. Black people convert to Judaism for the same reasons anyone converts to Judaism. Many converts are originally Christians that become interested in the Jewish matriarchs and patriarchs such as Sarah, Abraham, Isaac, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Being Black and Jewish is not contradictory at all. A) Converts Mostly in the US, Black individuals can and do convert to Judaism every day. There are at least 25,000, perhaps more. B) Ethiopia There was a large well-organized Black Jewish community for many centuries. The non-Jews call them Felashas (Invaders). They call themselves Beta Israel (House of Israel). They number 150,000. They always identified as Jews and strictly observed all the laws of the written Torah. Israel has airlifted almost all to the Jewish state. Many have adopted Orthodox Judaism and also observe some traditional Beta Israel customs. C) Uganda There is a tribe called Abayudaya. They number about 3,000. Many have recently adopted Orthodox Judaism. D) Nigeria There is a Black tribe called Igbo. They number 3,000. Many have recently adopted Orthodox Judaism. E) South Africa/Zimbabwe There is a Black tribe called Lemba. They number 50,000. Most attend churches or mosques but also assert Jewish ancestry. Many of their religious practices have some similarities to Judaism but no direct connection. Jews? Time will tell. ",

You can practise Judaism and therefore be a Jew but to be a true Jew, you have to have direct ancestry to the Judaens. Being of African ancestry and being Jewish just to me does not add up. Sure you can be African and have Jewish roots, but being Jewish is a \u2018swarthy\u2019 thing. I sound biased, but it\u2019s like me claiming to be Japanese because my great great great grandfather was but not looking Japanese. ",
