            "answer_text": "More than you\u2019d imagine. Brown and Blair were both Scottish-born. If John Smith would have ever become Prime Minister, so was he. Alec Douglas-Home was born in London, but from landed gentry rooted in the borders. Macmillan was possibly one generation too far from being considered Scottish (as indeed is David Cameron) despite the obviously Scottish name. Ramsay Macdonald was pretty darn Scottish. Bonar Law was born in Canada, but his father was a minister of the Free Church of Scotland. And finally Henry Campbell-Bannerman. So I would argue six from 1905 onwards if you work on the basis as to whether they could play for the Scottish football team. And then going back, Gladstone was born in Liverpool but both parents were Scottish. And The Earl of Aberdeen. If you expand your question to include the major offices of state (Chancellor, Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary), I\u2019m pretty certain Scotland has a fair representation. ",
