I am german. When my parents went to France, for hollidays with me child, they gave me weekly money. Five Francs per week. Those were light pieces, aluminium or such. I kept what I could, one year the next. One year, anew hollidays in France, I wanted to pay icecream with those. When I showed my money pieces, the vendor went furiorous, he hit me. My precious five Francs from the year before were worth only five cents. When changing to \u20acuro, things went similarily.Firstly, very rapidly, one could buy for one \u20ac about what costed one NF, before.Devaluation about seven to one.Since then, things got worse. Strongly bad. ",
