            "answer_text": "I can share you Serbian side, because if i try to cover all sides, it might not be readable (tl;dr comes to mind).Yugoslavia was a creation by Serbian monarch, Petar I Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, grandson of the leader of the First Serbian rebellion against Ottomans. It was designed to bring together Southern Slavs in one country around Serbian Kingdom, ruled by a Serbian king. Field-marshal \u017divojin Mi\u0161i\u0107, general of the Serbian army has been dispatched beforehand to scout the morale of the populace in Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia and report to the king and if they\u2019re ready for a union. Field-marshal Mi\u0161i\u0107 came with a report that strongly advised against creation of Yugoslavia. He menacingly added that the kingdom might suffer for it. His advice was ignored, thus Yugoslavia was born. However, if Petar I wanted to rule that kingdom, it couldn\u2019t just carry name \u2018Serbia\u2019, which was only 1/4 of the total area, so it was named Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes - afterwards renamed to Kingdom of Yugoslavia (Kingdom of South Slav-ia). However, the differences that used to be minor in medieval age, grew to be insanely big. Serbs were Orthodox, Croats and Slovenes were Catholic, and there were many Muslim converts from the Ottoman era, which became new nation, Bosniaks, after the medieval kingdom of Bosnia, where they are mostly situated today. Those differences have proven to be irreparable, when Croats betrayed Yugoslavia and sided with Nazi Germany in 1941, after the invasion of Yugoslavia, and made their own puppet state of Independent state of Croatia, which incorporated lands from Croatia, whole of Bosnia, and lands from Serbia.  A genocide over Serbs by Croats happened that will never repair the relations of two nations. Usta\u0161a leader, Ante Paveli\u0107 and his henchman, cardinal Aloysius Stepinac, made a plan to exterminate 1/3 of Serbs, 1/3 exile, and 1/3 made into catholic Croats. Post-war committee of SFR Jugoslavia reported that 1,000,000-1,200,000 Serbs were murdered in \u2018cleansing\u2019 of the Nazi Croatia. Total civilian casualties were estimated around 1,700,000. After the WWII, Yugoslavia was re-established under communist rule, land was chopped up into new borders, and Serbia, which was still the largest, was split into four parts: Socialist republic of Serbia, Socialist republic of Macedonia and two provinces with highly autonomous governments, Vojvodina and Kosovo i Metohija. This design was supposed to bring down the political power of Serbia and make every republic equal. The said country lasted between 1945\u20131991, but apparent decay was visible trough out \u201980s, after the death of Marshal Josif Broz Tito, the socialist dictator who ruled the country with iron fist. During that age separatist movements and politicians and other public figures that spoke against the country and government ended up in prison, or in many cases, on Goli otok (Barren island) which was an island prison for troublemakers. Many of the Usta\u0161as (WWII Nazi Croats) ended their lives there.  Goli otok, under the scorching sun of Adriatic sea ( Croatia) The background hate story mostly revolved around Serbs and Croats, so the civil war of the \u201990s was long due, but there was centuries long disdain from Serbs towards Bosnian Muslims, who chose the easy life and \u2018\u2019Ottomanize\u2019\u2019 during Ottoman invasion, instead of living as 2nd class citizens like other Christians. When the Jugoslav People\u2019s Army (JNA) sent a brigade to Slovenia to quell riots and talk of separation, it was received as an attack to a sovereign republic, where Slovenia declared independence from SFR Jugoslavia. Same happened days latter in Croatia, where stationed JNA troops were attacked and forced to abandon positions. The conflict escalated into full-fledged war after Bosnia & Herzegovina declared independence at the incentive of the Bosniak Muslim side, while being the only country where the minority (45%) ruled the majority.  The mixed nations of Yugoslavia weren\u2019t ready for internal borders, so insurgencies (not counting official ones) happened. Serbs who were suddenly stuck outside of Yugoslavia by the newly carved borders declared their own republic within Croatia, the same way Croatia did to SFRJ, followed by creation of Republic of Srpska, in Bosnia which also \u2018kidnapped\u2019 a significant amount of Serb populace from Yugoslavia. While Serbian Krajina in Croatia has been abandoned by the Yugoslavian officials, it was made clear that a second genocide might be coming that way, so the Serbs left Croatia by hundreds of thousands in an epic exodus. But, Serb population in newly formed Republic of Srpska stood their ground, which is where the war got the ugliest. Serbian-Croatian hate escalated in WWII and was resurrected in the 90s war, but the hate between Muslim Bosniaks and Serbs escalated for the first time during civil war, where Bosniaks tried to carve their own republic while simultaneously try to \u2018cleanse\u2019 the land from Serbs, like Croats did. Calling Jihad on Serbs and announcing the days of Ottomans didn\u2019t do them justice, because in this crucial time, between exodus, Neo-Nazi Croats, and Neo-Ottoman Bosniaks Serbs took this threat seriously, taught by history to never again allow themselves to be murdered and vandalized. Through out war the hate grew more than ever, and the war crimes grew more horrifying. These countries were never meant to get together, and if they did, never to divide. In retrospect, King Petar I should have listened to his trusty field-marshal and leave well enough alone. ",

            "answer_text": "tl;dr version for now (I will revisit if I find time): Two times Southern Slavic people tried to build a federation, two times we ended up with Greater Serbia. The first time the main culprits were expansionist Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 and naive Croats of Yugoslav Committee; the second time we can mostly blame power-hungry Josip Broz Tito, a Croat Partisan leader who selected Serbs as his most convenient power base in the effort to build a \u201cBalkan Federation\u201d. Why did we not separate in a \u201cvelvety\u201d way of Czechs and Slovaks? First of all, economy: the \u201csenior partner\u201d in Czechoslovakia, Czechs, did not need Slovakia; Serbia very much needed Croatia and Slovenia. Second, leaders: both Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and Tu\u0111man came to power on the wave of nationalism typical for the times of economical crisis, but Milo\u0161evi\u0107 turned this into violent physical expansionism, a tiger you cannot let go once you grabbed its tail.
