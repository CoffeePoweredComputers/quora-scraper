            "answer_text": "Yes, Azerbaijan and Armeny officially in war almost 30 years! Yes, yes no matter what or how Armenian loby wants to change truth that they invaded and occupied the lands of Azerbaijan, today it is time to get what belongs to Azerbaijan. All alone I am against to war but if it is the only way to solve this problem which was not solved by worldwide peace organizations and big powers, and if Armenia continues to harm my friends,family and lands so why we need to keep silent for such a crime? Today we are fighting for justice of innocent babies who was killed with evil deeds in Karabakh and we are geting back what belongs to us! Actually war is going against terrorist and seperatist who are invaded the lands of Azerbaijan. Armenia must leave all of the occupied lands and keep away their soldiers and people from that zone away for preventing futher casualities. Our nation fighting for their sovereighnty while Armenian people dying for poorly ruled goverments and for their evil policy.  ",
