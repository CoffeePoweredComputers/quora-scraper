            "answer_text": "Four mysterious gold hats  Four Bronze Age Gold Hats/Cones (Golden Hat of Schifferstadt. Urnfield tradition, Bronze Age. Dated to 1,400-1,300 BC and the oldest of its kind found to date. Historical Museum of the Palatinate, Speyer, Germany.) Who doesn't enjoy an archaeological mystery? Along with the Phaistos Disc, Voynich Manuscript, Ubaid Lizard Figurines and many other mysterious artifacts, the four Bronze Age golden hats or cones pictured above have generated numerous theories, controversies and debate for two centuries. What are they, how were they made, who made them and what exactly is their function? The answer that follows is just one of many attempts to synthesize the data- hoping to unlock even a small portion of the hats\u2019 origins. Relics and artifacts uncovered throughout the centuries have fueled modern reconstructions as to.how our ancient ancestors lived, what they believed in, and their technologies that enabled them to control and manipulate their environments. Occasionally, an astonishing find challenges our understanding of ancient societies and cultures and provides surprising new information about civilizations of the past. One such find, was the discovery of four cone-shaped golden hats from the Bronze Age. Discovered in Germany, Switzerland, and France, in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries, the four gold hats share many similarities in size, shape, design, and construction. The four gold hats date back to the Bronze Age of Western Europe, which lasted from 3300 \u2013 700 BC. All appear to have been created sometime around the middle of this period, ranging in age from 1400 \u2013 800 BC.[1] Their conical design mimics the well-known image of a witch\u2019s or wizard\u2019s hat, fueling speculation that the hats were worn by individuals who held such positions within the community[2] All of them appear to be adorned with astrological symbols[3] , indicating the ancients who used them had the knowledge to foretell the movements of the the sun and the moon.  The Four Gold Hats. From Left to Right: Vienne, France (1844); Southern Germany or Switzerland (1996); Schifferstadt, Germany (1835); Ezelsdorf, Germany (1953) (four gold hats - Google Search) The relics were constructed of sheets of gold, with intricate astronomical designs and demonstrate superb craftsmanship. While bearing striking similarities, each hat is somewhat unique in its\u2019 specific features.  The Golden Hat of Schifferstadt (Golden Hat of Schifferstadt) The first hat was uncovered by a farmer in 1835 at Schifferstadt, Germany, and appears to have been intentionally buried.[4] It is the shortest of the four hats, standing at 29.6 cm high. It is divided into bands that run the full length of the hat, with each band decorated with one of several designs including circles, disc shapes, and eye-like shapes.[5] The Golden Hat of Schifferstadt is believed to have been manufactured sometime between 1400\u20131300 BC. When discovered, the hat was on a burnt slab of clay with three bronze axes leaning against it.[6] If only the clay material had survived, perhaps more would be known about the hat\u2019s intended function. The second hat discovered was the Avanton Gold Cone, discovered in Avanton, France in 1844. The Avanton hat is believed to have been created between 1000-900 BC, and is the only once missing a brim, although signs of damage indicate that one did exist earlier[7] The cone stands at 55 cm. Like the Golden Hat of Schifferstadt, the Avanton hat is also banded, with repeated circular symbols.  The Avanton Gold Cone (Avanton Gold Cone \u2013 Joy of Museums In 1953, the Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch, was discovered. The Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buck is the tallest of the four hats, at 88 cm tall, and contains the similar banded designs with repeated circles, discs, and eye-like shapes.[8] It is believed to have originated between 1000-900 BC.  Close-ups of the Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch, showing the intricate designs carved into the gold sheeting ( Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch) The provenance of the fourth gold hat is less clear but is believed to have originated in either southern Germany or Switzerland \u2013 coming to notice of archaeologists and collectors during an international arts trade exposition in 1995. Fabricated around 1000-800 BC, the Berlin Gold Hat is named after the museum that purchased the artifact.[9]Standing at at 75 cm tall, it exhibits the same banded pattern as the others. It is ironic that the artifact with an unknown provenance, should prove to be the most archaeologically significant of the four. The information lost when this artifact was removed from its place of origin could have been the crucial piece of the puzzle in solving the mystery of the four gold hats.  Detail of the Berlin Gold Hat ( The Berlin Gold Hat or Berliner Goldhut - the mysterious late Bronze Age artifact made of thin gold leaf) The four gold hats were fabricated from a gold alloy containing 85-90% Au, about 10% Ag and traces of Cu.and Sn (< 1% each).[10] They are made of seamless single pieces of gold sheet, hammered to a thinness between 0.25 millimetres (0.0098 in) (Schifferstadt) and 0.6 millimetres (0.024 in) (Berlin). Thus, the cones are surprisingly light considering their size. The Ezelsdorf example, measuring 89 centimetres (35 in) in height, weighs only 280 grams (9.9 oz).[11] Tribological characteristics of gold tends to harden with increasing deformation, increasing gold's potential to crack.[12] To avoid cracking, an extremely even deformation was necessary. Additionally, the material had to be softened by repeatedly heating it to a temperature of at least 750 \u00b0C (1,380 \u00b0F).[13] Since gold alloy has a relatively low melting point of about 960 \u00b0C (1,760 \u00b0F), careful temperature control and an isothermal heating process were required, so as to avoid melting any of the surface.[14] For this, the Bronze Age artisans used a charcoal fire or oven similar to those used for pottery. The temperature could only be controlled through the addition of oxygen, using a bellows. Considering the tribologic conditions and the technical means available at the time, the production even of an undecorated Golden hat would represent an immense technical achievement.[15]  Golden Hat of Schifferstadt - Wikipedia As their fabrication continued, the Golden hats were embellished with rows of radial ornamental bands, chased into the metal.[16]To make this possible, they were probably filled with a putty or tree-based pitch. Traces of wax have survived on the Schifferstadt specimen.[17] The thin gold leaf was structured by chasing: stamp-like tools or moulds depicting bands of individual symbols were repeatedly pressed into (or rolled along) the exterior of the golden hat.[18] Systematic sequences in terms of number and types of. ornaments per band,- mostly disks and concentric circles, usually with an internal disk or buckle, surrounded by up to six concentric circles, sometimes wheels - were punched using stamps, rolls or combs.[19] The older examples (Avanton, Schifferstadt) show a more restricted range of ornaments than the later ones. Striking are two bands with eye-like motifs, resembling similar symbols on the hats of Ezelsdorf and Berlin.[20] Unlike the other examples, the Berlin cone's top is not decorated with a star but left entirely unembellished.[21] The exact function of the gold hats is ambiguous. While they were each found in different areas, speculations have evolved around the hats as a group, under the assumption that they were all used for similar purposes. For some time, the hats were believed to be symbols of fertility, perhaps due to their phallic shape.[22] Others considered the hats part of an ancient suit of armor[23] , or that they were used as ceremonial vases.[24] Later, the hats were believed to have been placed upon stakes at sites of worship, to serve as decorative caps.[25]  Suggested conical hats worn by priests? at the altar(Kungagraven \u2013 A Grave Fit for a Nordic Bronze Age King, But Who Was Buried Inside?) Golden Hats served as religious insignia for the deities or priests of a sun cult widespread throughout Bronze Age Central Europe.[26] Their use as head-gear is strongly supported by the fact that the three of four examples have a cap-like widening at the bottom of the cone, and that their openings are oval (not round), with diameters and shapes roughly equivalent to those of a human skull.[27] The figural depiction of an object resembling a conical hat on a stone slab of the King's Grave at Kivim, southern Sweden[28] strongly supports their association with religion and cult, as does the fact that the known examples appear to have been intentionally deposited. An intensive examination of the Berlin hat suggests that the embossed symbols represent a lunisolar calendar.[29] The object may have been instrumental in the determination of dates or periods in both lunar and solar calendars. An exact knowledge of the solar year was of special interest for the determination of religiously important events such as the summer and winter solstices.[30] Such astronomical knowledge would have been highly valued during the Bronze Age.  Metonic cycle - Wikipedia The system of the mathematical function incorporated into the artistic ornamentation has not been fully deciphered so far, but a schematic study of the Berlin Golden Hat and the periods it may delimit has been attempted. Each symbol, or each ring of a symbol, may represent a single day. Apart from ornament bands incorporating differing numbers of rings there are seemingly special symbols and zones intercalary areas, which may have had to be added to or subtracted from the periods in question.[31] The surface of the Berlin cone is adorned with an astonishing number of sun symbols and half-moon figures, 1,739 to be exact.[32] It has been determined that all these figures create a sophisticated code that accurately matches the Metonic cycle, 18.67 years, a finding attributed to Meton, a Greek astronomer of the 5th century BC (five centuries after this cone was produced).[33]  Lost Device Of Highly Advanced Civilization: 3,000-Year-Old Golden Conical Hats - Prehistoric European Mystery | Ancient Pages The hypothesized functions would have permited the counting of temporal units of up to 57 months.[34] A simple multiplication of such values could also permit the calculation of longer periods, e.g. metonic cycles. In principle, according to this theory, starting with zone Z i, a sum is achieved by adding a relevant contiguous number of neighbouring sections: Zi Zi+n. To reach the equivalent lunar or solar value, from this initial sum must be subtracted the sum of symbols from the intercalary zone(s) within the area counted.[35] The illustration below depicts the solar representation on the left and the lunar one on the right. The red or blue fields in zones 5, 7, 16 and 17 are intercalary zones. The values in the individual fields are reached by multiplying the number of symbols per zone with the number of rings or circles incorporated in each predominant symbol. The special symbols in zone 5 are assigned the value of \"38\", as indicated by their number. Example: Zone 12 is dominated by 20 repetitions of punched symbol No. 14, a circular disc symbol surrounded by 5 concentric circles. Thus, the symbol has the value of 20 x 5 = 100. The smaller ring symbols placed between the larger repetitions of No. 14 are considered as mere ornaments and thus not counted.[36]  Calendrical function of the Berlin Gold Hat (Mysterious Gold Cones \u201cHats of Ancient Wizards) Via this system, the hats could be used to calculate a lunisolar calendrical system, i.e. a direct reading in either lunar or solar dates, as well as the conversion between them.The table can be used in the same way as the original Golden Hats may have been. To determine the number of days in a specific time period (yellow fields), the values of the coloured fields above are added, reaching an intermediate sum. If any of the red intercalary zones are included, their sum has to be subtracted. This allows the calculation of 12, 24, 36, 48, 54 and 57 synodic months in the lunar system and of 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54 and 57 sun months (i.e. twelfths of a tropical year). Example: To determine a 54 month cycle in the lunar system, the numerical values of the green or blue zones 3 to 21 are added, reaching a sum of 1,739 days. From this, the values of the red intercalary fields 5, 16 and 17 are subtracted, The result is 1739-142=1597 days, or 54 synodic months of 29.5305 days each.[37] The overall discrepancy of 2 days to the astronomically accurate value is probably the result of a slight imprecision in the Bronze Age observation of synodic and solar month.[38] To date, German archaeologists and historians believe that the hats were used by individuals who would have been viewed as \u2018wizards\u2019 during the Bronze Age. The astrological symbols were used to track the stars and the sun, facilitating agricultural predictions, namely when to plant and harvest. The figures who wore the hats were referred to as \u201cking-priests.\u201d because they were able to make predictions and were therefore believed to have supernatural powers.[39] While predictions of time and weather are commonplace today due to modern knowledge and technology, the ability to predict climate conditions during the Bronze Age would have been considered a divine power. The king-priests would have been regarded as Lords of Time who had access to a divine knowledge that enabled them to look into the future.[40] The sun and moon symbols are compatible with the \u201cMetonic Cycle,\u201d which provides an explanation of the time relationship between the sun and moon.[41] The knowledge that this pattern provided would have allowed for long-term predictions of sun and moon cycles. Overall, this demonstrates that those who inhabited Europe during the Bronze Age were far more sophisticated than initially believed. It is easy to see how the ability to make such long-term astrological predictions would give one the appearance of having divine or magical powers back in the Bronze Age.[42] Perhaps the idea that the gold hats were worn by ancient wizards isn\u2019t a legend or a myth, but a true reflection of how the wearers were viewed due to their ability to predict time.  The Mold Cape, Wales (Golden hat | Wikiwand) The hats are considered part of the Proto-Celtic Bronze Age Urnfield culture.[43] Their close similarities in symbolism and techniques of manufacture are testimony to a coherent Bronze Age culture over a wide-ranging territory in eastern France and western and southwestern Germany. Reportedly, five more golden cones similar to those kept at present in Germany and France have been excavated in Ireland in the past, throughout the 17th and the 18th centuries.[44] Sadly, all five have disappeared. In a burial mound at Mold Flintstone, a 3,700-year-old solid gold pectoral was found at Mold Flinstonep, although the relative chronology is muddled.[45] Finely crafted out of a single sheet of gold, the artifact was embellished with embossed decorations designed to mimic multiple strings of beads amid folds of cloth.[46] The unique form and design of the cape is regarded as one of the finest examples of prehistoric sheet-gold working in Europe and perhaps the world. Similarities in manufacture and design, suggest that the cape and hats were part of a larger cultural heritage. All were made from a single sheet of gold, and all share similar patterns of embossing. The cape dates from about 1900-1600 BCE[47] , and the hats date from 1400-800 BCE.[48] Despite the time difference between the artifacts, the similarities indicate a shared culture and knowledge.  The Mold Gold Cape The discovery of the four gold hats has provided a fascinating insight into the life and practices of those who lived around three millennia ago. The findings radically alter the standard image of the European Bronze Age as an era in which a society of primitive farmers lived in smoke-filled wooden huts eking out an existence from the land with the most basic of tools.[49] The use of the hats to predict the movements of the sun, and the time relationship between the sun and the moon isn\u2019t entirely novel, as many ancient artifacts are derivative from astrological onservances. But why they chose to express such knowledge in the form of golden hats remains unclear. Perhaps with further research, we will someday know why the Lord of Time of the Bronze Age wore these spectacular hats of gold and if the wearer of stunning Mold Cape superseded them all.

This is the link of the article: 10 Hard To Explain Mysterious Places Around the World And for those who are too lazy to click on the hyperlink, this is, according to the article, \u201csome of the most mysterious and unknown places on earth which are a bot alien to our world yet beautiful.\u201d 1. Racetrack Playa/ Sailing Stones, Death Valley  Have you ever heard of any rock sailing of its own without any human help? Well now you will for sure. I am sure most of you have no idea about this Sailing Stone in Death valley, California. This sailing stone has been a mystery since 1915 when people saw a track which indicated a stone has moved itself in the dry land. This sailing stone has been recorded and studied further so that people can lean about their mysterious travel. Some believed that the rocks move due to the formation of the ice around the stones which makes then move while others still find it a mystery. No one has ever seen those rocks moving. Some rocks takes linear moments while other creates oval turns. Well, kind of a mystery right? 2. Magnetic Hill, Ladakh, India  Most of you might be planning for an adventure to this wonderful land Ladakh. Whether you are off for a road trip or just a trip to beat the biting heat of summer, Ladakh is the name you have. Well, if you are heading out to this land then you might have definitely wondered about the Magnetic Hills here which tends to pull the vehicles. This mysterious hill is a small stretch road which comes on your way of Srinagar- Leh highway. This uphill road is as mysterious as it looks. While you are driving through the road if you turned off your car and let it stand neutral, your car will slowly start moving on its own and that too at a speed of 20km/hr. Believe it or Not, this hill actually exists. 3. Moeraki Boulders, New Zealand  Let me take you to another place which holds a different mystery for you. Most people considered it to be some giant stone eggs laid right on the beach while others are still trying to figure out the mystery. Koekohe Beach in New Zealand and is a rare sight to watch where one can find numerous mammoth boulders scattered around the place. With its green and brown views, this place offers some picturesque views mixed with mystery. These spherical rocks grow up to 12-feet in circumference. People believe that these are a result of a plethora of minerals and sediments which have accumulated and solidified around the fossil. Is Sound some kind of mystery right? 4. Aokighara, Japan  If you are a movie buff and mystery hunter then you have definitely heard about the Aokighara Forest in Japan. Back in 2016 the movie The Forest shows about the spooky and eeriness of this forest which has been haunting people ever since. Also, known as the Suicide Forest, Aokighara is located at the foothills of Mount Fuji in Japan. Many cases of haunting and apparitions are said to have been felt inside the forest. More than 500 people are believed to have committed suicide in this forest. Although this forest is considered as the most enchanting forest in the world the haunting makes this one of a kind. Dare to visit this ground\u2026. 5. Eternal Flame Falls, Orchard Park, New York  There is another creepy place in Orchard Park, New York which will give you goose bumps. In the far Shale Creek preserve a section of Chestnut Ridge Park one can see a flickering flame burning inside a tiny waterfall. You might ignore it first but once you stare at it you will find the flame burning bright. Each day a lot of methane gas escapes from this place making it inflammable. See the magic unfold as you visit this park and witness the fighting flames of fire inside the waterfall. At times the flames get extinguished by the water but voila it lights up again. 6. Old Faithful, Yellowstone National Park  Mysteries are always hard to guess but they are always fascinating. Another such mysterious place is the Old Faithful Geyser at Yellowstone National Park. A number of 300 active geysers of hot springs are seen erupting here. But most of all the Old faithful is the one which has made Old Yellowstone very famous. With its regularity of the eruptions, this eye-catching geyser is a soothing view to the eyes of the onlookers. This eruption occurs every 55 to 120 minutes and lasts for two to five minutes. A lot of tourist across the globe visits this National Park to enjoy the white smoky eruptions. 7. Pamukkale, Turkey  Another interesting mystery which is a must see attraction for you is the Pamukkale in Turkey. Lcium This snowy landscape is the result of calcium carbonate which has been deposited from 17natural hot springs over a period of thousand years. Well, another interesting fact about this place is the mineral rich water here which is believed to have some therapeutic benefits. It is said that the temperature here rises up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. People visit this place today to enjoy the stunning views of the terraces, cliffs and petrified white waterfalls of Pamukkale. 8. Blood Falls, Antarctica  Imagine a snowy mountain having a blood bath in between. Sound\u2019s something unnatural right? Well here you have the blood red waterfall staining the white Taylor Glacier. This phenomenon is still a mystery to the people as to why the waterfall is coloured with red hues every time it flows. Well may microbiologist and glaciologist says that this occur due to the rich iron which is present in the Lake. The water which flows from the lake creates this red hue and making it look as if blood is flowing out into the water. 9. The Stone Forest \u2013 Shilin Stone Forest, China  Now when we conjure up about forest all we can think of is the greenery and the soothing wildlife there. But, what if I tell you about a Stone Forest? Mysterious right! Well, right in the Yunnan Province of China lays this one of a kind mysterious Shilin Stone Forest. Instead of tall trees and shrubs this forest has multitudinous towering limestone. These limestones have formed over an area of 96,000 acres making it look like a forest of stones. This mystifying forest is visited by thousand of tourist every year to witness its one of a kind beauty. 10. Longyearbyen, Norway  Imagine few months of day light and never experiencing the night time. Sound something usual again right? Well, this Norwegian archipelago lying in the north of Greenland in the Arctic Sea experience only daylight from April 20 to August 23. During this phenomenal occurrence, the people residing here does not get a chance to witness the starlit night during this time. Nights will become stories for them during this time. Absurdly during these periods the sun never set over the Svalbard archipelago. Believe it or not it actually, happens at this place every year. Cheers. ",
