            "answer_text": "The Presidential Debate of 2020 was a widely recognized shitshow of interruptions (Trump some 71\u201377) (Biden some 21\u201323) in only 90 minutes, and questionable claims or non-answers. Being on TV was a major factor. Physical and mental abilities of the candidates was a point of high interest if not an actual debate question. The regimes of China and Russia got the biggest boost off the first debate I think, as both have claimed internationally that our democracy is a mess and this looked liked visible proof for all the world to see. The Lincoln-Douglas debates (1858) were not actually Presidential debates, but for a US Senate seat from Illinois. The format was different, the speaking turns were longer, reportedly less chaotic (newspaper coverage but no TV or radio). The physical and mental fitness for office was apparently not in question. It\u2019s not clear that other countries took a lot of interest. ",
