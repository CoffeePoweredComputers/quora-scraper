            "answer_text": "If your grandfather was not born in Italy, but one of his parents was, the only way to find out is to do some research by getting a true copy of your Italian born great-grandparent's birth record from the city where he/she was born. From that you should be able to figure out: a) the date and place of your great-grandparents' marriage; and b) whether your Italian great-grandparent naturalized him/herself (and therefore lost her Italian citizenship) before or after your grandfather's birth. Should the latter case be verified, your grandfather was an Italian citizen by birth, and you could claim recognition of Italian citizenship by descent. ",

            "answer_text": "To find out if your grandfather was an Italian citizen, you might start by checking the 1930 census, the most recent U.S. census to be released, at Free Family History and Genealogy Records , assuming he was alive and in the U.S. then. You can find other records on him there, too. You can check Ellis Island records for arrivals in the U.S. You can check the local courthouse to see if he was naturalized there. You can check out the National Archives (NARA) online, last updated 2010, for immigration records. ",
