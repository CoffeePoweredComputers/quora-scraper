            "answer_text": "\"Why were American cars of the 1950s - 1970s so massive in comparison to European and Asian marques?\" In the 50's - 70's, gas was cheap, the economy was robust, the roads were good, and our society had already begun the conversion to suburbs. People had to travel to work, to shop, to the mall, and to travel a wide country. During those years, the favorite weekend activity was to get in the car and drive. North, South, East or West. Go to the mountains, to the seashore, to the country, or to the city. All of this was best served by big cars that were comfortable to drive and ride in for substantial distances. Remember, in Europe and Asia there was long history of mixed development. People would often walk or bike to work, to the store, or take the train for trips to the big city, or to a remote location. None of that was really true outside of the US big cities. Land was comparatively cheap, and so you could have your house with a two car garage, and keep your cars ready to go. Public transport was generally not available outside of urban centers. Yeah, you could take a train, once you got to the station, but you had to drive to the station. So the entire psychology of the population was different from that of Asia or Europe. ",
