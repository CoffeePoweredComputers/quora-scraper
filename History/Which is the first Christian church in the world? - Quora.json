            "answer_text": "it was an underground Church because of the persecution from Paganism that actually started in Babylon as a church of God before Christ was born, after the birth of Christ the real Church was still persecuted and when the Catholic church was Organized and no one could buy or sell if they didn\u2019t join they were persecuted also, so we have always had an underground Church where the people can worship God in their own right without the influence of some theology, or some ones supposed authority on the Bible such as Seminaries. we know that the Bible is the most simple Book ever written, all it takes is a simple Mind to understand it, usually educated people can\u2019t figure it out, so they do a lot of guess work by leaning to their own understanding which the Bible condemns. LEAN not to your own understanding but by every word the procedeth out of the Mouth of God. ",

The apostle Paul addresses those churches in his letters, Philippians, Ephesians, Galatians, etc. I do not know which church was the first to appear. ",
