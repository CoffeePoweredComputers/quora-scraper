            "answer_text": "Here is a related issue \u2026 not an eclipse but the appearance of a comet. It had been known from antiquity that comets brought disaster. Cicero, about 50 BC, recorded \u2026 cometas semper calamitatum praenuntios fuisse \u2013 comets always presaged calamity. But with the advent of Christianity comets and meteorites were banned as heathen superstitions. When a large comet appeared in 1456 the citizens of Rome arose in such an uproar of apprehension and panic that Pope Calixtus III was forced to intervene. He led prayers of exorcism against the evil apparition, at which the devil turned its black body upon its red tail and fled away into outer darkness. But it returned in 1531 and again every 75 years until recognised by Edmund Halley as a long-period comet, now bearing his name. ",

            "answer_text": "Ancient civilizations didn't know the true cause of an eclipse, that a solar eclipse was just the result of the moon coming between the Earth and the Sun, so they ascribed all kinds of mystical causes to it. The Vedic civilization of ancient India believed that the cause was a serpent who had eaten some ambrosia, the food of the gods, and had become immortal. He was cut in two and the head and tail became two gods, Rahu and Ketu. According to Vedic beliefs, an eclipse happened when Rahu, the serpent's head, began eating the Sun, so there was probably much chanting and banging of drums until the serpent released his grip. Interestingly, in astronomy Rahu and Ketu, which are regarded as planets in Vedic astrology, are actually the North and South nodes of the Moon, and an eclipse only happens when the moon is at one of those two points, so there may have been some truth in the legend after all.
