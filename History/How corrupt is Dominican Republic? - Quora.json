            "answer_text": "The most corrupt, in my opinion. The United States recently indicted Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction giant. In that indictment, Odebrecht admitted to giving bribes in the amount of 92 million dollars to Dominican politicians in return for their winning bids for 17 construction projects since 2001 to present. There were other Latin American countries involved in which the same bribes occurred. The DR received more money for bribes than the majority of the other countries but has not indicted anyone. Yet in countries like Panama, Peru and Columbia, for example, most of the guilty parties who received bribes are in jail or being indicted. The DR was so comfortable for the Brazilian construction giant that they set up shop here for their bribery operations according to Odecbrecht officials. Most of the projects constructed in the DR were overpriced by 2 or three times. The cost of building a kilometer of road in Germany, for example, costs the DR three times as much. In return for the bribes, Odebrecht assured that they would win in the bidding process. Although other companies were charging much less. guess who won the bids. Most recently, Odebrecht officials in return for a lesser sentence began detailing how dirty the DR has been in the corruption area. For example, there is word from high ranking officials that they paid for the presidential campaigns of various Latin American countries, including that of the Danilo Medina, who is the current president. In my opinion, the problem in the DR is that the country hasn\u2019t been a \u201cdemocracy\u201d for long and still clings to it\u2019s dictatorial ways of the past and corruption is in their DNA and it\u2019s looked upon as normal. With such a young democracy the three branches of government don\u2019t work as they are supposed to - each checking on each other. Instead of being a check, they work only for those in power. Thus the PLD party has the judges, the congress, the senators and the attorney general in his pocket, which is why no one has been indicted, as has been done in all the other countries affected. Nor has the attorney general gone after project overpricing, which is a lot more money involved than the 92 million in bribes paid out. For every million in bribes paid, Odebrecht would charge 10 million in overpricing in order to get their money back. All this on the back of the poor people of the DR because this was paid by the people via the taxes they pay to the government. The only section of the country that they don\u2019t have in their pockets are the people. Because primarily of social media, the people are starting to learn about Democracy and are taking to the streets to protest. There have been huge protests in the National District as well as in Santiago, the second largest city, and most recently in Puerto Plata in the north. More protests are planned by grass roots march organizers called La Marcha Verde. The government has tried to dampen their voices by buying radio ads, buying journalists and newspapers or saying that it is a political movement to destabilize the government. Mr. Medina has tried to cover his participation in the biggest project that Odecbrecht has taken part in -the Punta Catalina coal plant. He commissioned a commission to investigate Punta Catalina. The problem is that everyone on that commission has a conflict of interest that would preclude them from being honest about the outcome. The country is broken because of corruption. Had it not been for this deficiency, this would have be a very prosperous country. Every year the central bank has said that the economy has grown successively by about five percent each year. Update: May 2020 No one has been sent to jail yet. ",

            "answer_text": "Corruption is build in into the Dominican frame of mind. In any business that you do in DR you have to take into account the bribes, kickbacks and bonuses you will need to spread around in order to get your project started otherwise you will hit your head against a bureaucratic stone wall that will kill anything you try to develop. And this is not just at the low level, this goes all the way to the top as shown by the recent scandal with the Tucano planes (Dominican Republic Arrests Four Accused of Taking Embraer Bribes ) The government turns a blind Eye on this as many high ranking officials and elected officers that have being signaled out for acts of corruption bankroll the ruling party\u2019s candidates. Plus they have control of the high courts and can kill any corruption case that is raised by the civil society. ",
