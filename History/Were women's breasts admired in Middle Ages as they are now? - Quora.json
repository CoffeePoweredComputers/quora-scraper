            "answer_text": " Were women's breasts admired in Middle Ages as they are now? Yes. Breasts have been noticed since humanity developed. Men want to look and feel. Women usually just compare. In the middle ages, the majority of the art was made in the monasteries. By monks. By monks who were often placed in monasteries as babes or toddlers. Monks who reached adulthood without seeing a female breast. Except\u2026\u2026 The Lady, The Madonna, The Virgin, God\u2019s Mother, or whatever your preferred name was in frescos in the religious house, in icons, in mosaics, and in manuscripts. Manuscripts with pictures. Pictures of a woman with breasts. Sometimes, an artist was assigned to draw and paint just such a picture. See the four guys above? Three are congratulating the fourth for his assignment. He is permitted \u2014 no, ordered \u2014 to paint something he has never seen except in art. He is a good artist, one who wants to do his best for the Virgin, for God, and his monestary. How can he depict something he has never seen?? I wish him well. By this century, the majority of religious works produced in the Middle Ages are in museums. Only there can they be correctly preserved for our enjoyment. The Metropolitan Museum has a collection that was the source of the following pictures. Most painted by monks who never saw the real things. A.

Artist: Paolo di Giovanni Fei (Italian, San Quirico, active by 1369\u2013died 1411) Date: 1370s Credit Line: Bequest of George Blumenthal, 1941 Now, in the late Middle Ages, manuscripts were also produced outside the monasteries so nudity became more common.
