            "answer_text": "Some say from a passing warrior chief lured on to the rocks by the fairest mermaid in all the oceans. Some say from fantastic and fabled creatures, unicorns and pixies. Some even claim from angels sent from heaven to bring enlightenment to the world. Personally I believe directly from God himself as his chosen people. The unbelievers of course reckon there is no remaining evidence of settlement before the Mesolithic period when presumably a bunch of folks wandered across from Europe as the ice sheets melted. Historically emerging from two tribes, the Picts and the Gaels you should also add in a mix of Anglo-Saxons, Norse and Cumbrians. Curiously, superficial DNA testing shows similarities between Scottish, Irish and Spanish ancestry. But what do they know. I prefer my explanation. ",

            "answer_text": "First there is no such thing as a Scottish People. The earliest accurately recorded group is probably the Picts who did leave some archaeological evidence of a distinctive civilisation. Other groups in the West and the western isles came from Ireland in several waves over several centuries (but then you get bogged down in \u2018where did the Irish come from?). Further to the South West the people of what is now Dumfries and Galloway were of Iron Age British decent, a different Celtic group from the Irish settlers, maintaining a distinct British identity well into the early mediaeval period. And then the Norse influence on the northern and western isles is significant. But so is the Norman French. Like any where in what is now the British isles the country was empty during the last Ice Age. Since the ice retreated, waves of settlers have been in what is now Scotland. At the risk of causing offence I might suggest \u2018Scots\u2019 is as much a location as an ethnicity in recorded history. ",
