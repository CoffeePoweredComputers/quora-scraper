            "answer_text": "Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. She was renowned for her work with radioactivity, and it was that work that would eventually end her life.  She was born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland on November 7, 1867. She was the fifth and last child of piano player and teacher Bronsilawa Boguska and mathematics and physics professor, Wladyslaw Sklodowski. Her childhood nickname was Manya. Her father was a freethinker and her mother was a Catholic.  Her family valued education, and so she began her education early. She possessed a remarkable memory. She graduated from secondary school when she was sixteen, receiving a gold medal for her work. Unfortunately her father made some bad investments and she had to go to work at a young age as a teacher, postponing the continuance of her own education. At the age of 18 she became a governess, and put her sister, Bronia, through school with the agreement that Bronia would return the favor- and she did.  In 1891 at the age of 24, Sklodowska went to Paris to study mathematics, physics and chemistry at the Sorbonne. She studied fervently, and subsisted almost entirely on bread, butter and tea. During her years there she changed the spelling of her name to the French version, Marie.  She met Pierre Curie in Paris while she studied there, and they soon married in a Civil ceremony. Marie had left the Catholic church when she was 20 and Pierre was not a member of any religion, either.  Marie and Pierre Curie devoted themselves to the study of radioactivity, and were among the first to work with radium and polonium. It was Marie Curie who coined the term radioactivity, and she named Polonium after her home country of Poland. Pierre was chiefly concerned with the physical properties of radium and polonium, while Marie worked to isolate radium in its pure state. She and one of Pierre's students, Mr. Debierne, accomplished this, and Marie received her doctorate in 1903 based on her findings. Also in 1903, the Curies won the Nobel Prize for their work along with French physicist, Antoine Henri Bacquerel, who had first discovered natural radioactivity.  Marie and Pierre Curie had two daughters. Irene was born in 1897 and Eve was born in 1904. During their childhoods Marie was a physics instructor at the Normal Superior School for girls in S\u00e9vres, France. In 1904 she became chief assistant in Pierre's laboratory.  In 1906, Pierre Curie, whose health had begun to fail due to the work with radioactivity, was hit by a car and killed. This was a deep tragedy for the family, but it strengthened Marie's resolve to continue their work. On May 13, she was appointed to fill Pierre's position and became the first female professor at the Sorbonne.  In 1911 Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize for her achievement of isolating radium and examining its chemical properties. She was the first person ever to receive two Nobel Prizes. In 1914 she co-founded the Radium Institute in Paris and was it's first Director. During the first World War, Curie and her daughter, Irene, taught a team of 150 nurses to use X-rays so that bullets could be located in injured soldiers. In 1921 she traveled to the United States where President Warren Harding presented her with a gram of radium purchased with a collection taken up among American Women. In 1922, as a member of the French Academy of Medicine she devoted her work to medical applications of radioactive substances. In 1932, the Radium Institute of Warsaw, Poland opened, under the directorship of Marie's sister, Bronia.  Marie Curie died at the age of 67 in 1934 of leukemia, brought on by her years of exposure to high levels of radiation. Her cremated remains are kept in the Pantheon in Paris. She was the first woman to be honored in this way for her personal achievements. After her death the Radium Institute was renamed the Curie Institute. ",

            "answer_text": "Marie Sklodowska Curie popularly known by his name Marie Curie or Madame Curie was the first woman to win the Nobel prize in Physics and Chemistry. She was born in Warsaw, Poland on 7 November 1867 and was the Daughter of Mr. Wladyslaw and Mrs. Bronislava. Madame Curie lost her mother at age of 10 due to Tuberculosis. She started her schooling earlier and was graduated at the age of 16. After her schooling, Curie went to Paris for abroad studies and her financial condition was such bad as she survived by eating buttered bread and tea. Curie completed her master's degree in Physics in 1893 and earned another degree in Mathematics in the following year. She met Pierre Curie, a Professor in the School of Physics in 1894, and in the following year, they were married. Their pair was also known for Scientific dynamic duo. Marie curie with the help of her husband discovered radioactivity on 20 April 1902. Pierre was killed accidentally by stepping in front of a horse cart. She was the first person to receive the Noble price twice, first in 1903 for Physics, and later in 1911 for Chemistry. She was also known as \u201c World war Hero \u201c as she laid in the development of X-rays during World War 1. She also discovered radioactive elements radium and polonium in 1898 and for that, she would always be remembered. In 1911, Curie confirmed her relationship with Paul Langevin and got married in the same year. In 1902, Curie confirmed that they had produced a decigram of pure radium demonstrating it as a unique chemical element and for that, she was awarded a Nobel prize. After the war, Curie used her celebrity to advance her research. She traveled to the United States twice \u2014 in 1921 and 1929 \u2014 to raise funds to buy radium and to establish a radium research institute in Warsaw. A few years later Madame Curie died due to Leukemia in 1934, a disease caused by the exposure to the radiation that marked her life work. ",
