            "answer_text": "After the end of WW II, Germany was divided into 4 zones, occupied by the 4 Allies USA, USSR, France and UK. The zones had been determined at the Jalta Conference in 1945. It was also determined that the capital of Germany, Berlin, would be administrated by the four Allies, divided into four zones. So the four Allies had occupied one zone of Germany each, and each of them ruled over one zone of Berlin. An allied control council (Alliierter Kontrollrat) was set up which should coordinate the allied actions in whole Germany. It also was agreed that the Western Allies would have free land and air access from their parts of Germany to their parts of Berlin (Transit Corridors). This was the reason for some troop withdrawals after the end of the war. The Red Army had conquered Berlin as a whole, but according to the Jalta treaty they withdrew from the Western parts of the city in order to leave them to the Western Allies. On the other hand the US army had invaded large parts of Thuringia in the Southeast of Germany, so they withdrew their troops to let the Russians in. The Jalta treaty also contained one decision: Germany should be kept as one country. Soon it became obvious that the USSR did not want to cooperate with the Western Allies anymore. In 1948, the Soviet representatives left the Allied control council. The Western Allies did not want to accept this, and they did not want to be held accountable for the mess, so they kept the Allied control council operational. Soon it became obvious that the USSR would not come back into the council, so the Western Allies put together their parts and formed the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, West Germany), while the Soviet Union encouraged the foundation of the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany). This was in 1949. In 1948 the Western Allies had introduced a new currency in West Germany. The USSR took this as a reason to call the Allied administration doomed. They demanded from the Western Allies to leave Berlin and give them full control over all of East Germany. The Western Allies did not want to comply with that, so the USSR put Western Berlin under isolation. The transit corridors were closed, West Berlin was about to starve to death. The Western Allies did not want to accept that and started the famous Berlin Air Lift (Luftbr\u00fccke), which kept the city alive for more than a year (1948-1949). Finally the USSR gave up. The Western Allies allowed the foundation of the FRG in 1949, and later in the same year the GDR was founded. The Russians did not see any sense in keeping East Berlin separated from the rest of East Germany, so East Berlin became the capial of East Germany. West Berlin had a special status. West Germany regarded it as a part of their country, it was one of eleven federal states. West Berlin had representatives in the Bundesrat, the parliament of the federal states. However, citizens of West Berlin were not allowed to participate in national elections. In 1969 Willy Brandt became Federal Cancellor, he had been mayor of West Berlin before. When counting the votes for his election in the Federal parliament, his vote did not count, because he was not a citizen of West Germany. On the other hand, the Western Allies refused to call the allied control council void. So they behaved as if everything was like 1945. People of West Berlin had passports and identity cards saying that these documents were temporary. They looked similar to the West German ones, but instead of saying \u201cPassport, issued by the Federal Republic of Germany\u201d it was written \u201cpreliminary passport, issued by the Senate of Berlin\u201d. All laws which passed the West German parliament, became valid in Berlin only after they were also voted on by the West Berlin parliament (all were passed!). And West Berlin administration had to report frequently to the Western Allies, which had the right to intervene if they did not like certain decisions. West Germany did a lot to treat West Berlin as a part of West Germany. Cars in West Berlin had license plates exactly like those in West Germany. Phone numbers in West Berlin had the country code for West Germany: +49. Once a year the West German Parliament even gathered for an official conference in West Berlin. This event often was disturbed by Russian fighter planes creating supersonic booms above the Reichstag. West Berlin had the same currency, but slightly different postal stamps than West Germany. Nevertheless, the Allied administration reserved the right to rule over Berlin. So it was forbidden to produce military goods in West Berlin, citizens of West Berlin were not subject to be drafted for military service in West Germany, there was no draft at all (which made many young men move to Berlin in order to avoid military service). The USSR and East Germany regarded West Berlin as an \u201cindependent political entity\u201d (selbst\u00e4ndige politische Einheit). But they did not want to risk a war, so they accepted the rules of the allied command treaty. This granted the allied countries access to Berlin, but not West Germany. So if you wanted to fly from West Berlin to West Germany, there were only Air France or British Airways or Pan Am. Deutsche Lufthansa was not allowed to fly to West Berlin, as well as GDR airline Interflug. The first Lufthansa landing in Sch\u00f6nefeld was in summer 1990, with children on vacation from the Chernobyl nuclear fallout areas (the Russians couldn\u2019t say \u201cnjet\u201d to this one). The West German railway organisation Bundesbahn was not allowed to send trains to West Berlin. So if you wanted to travel from West Germany to West Berlin, locomotives were changed at the border between West and East Germany - and all passengers were controlled by East German border police and given a visa for the ride. Contrary to other opinions, West Berlin was never an independent state. It was an occupied territory, controlled by an allied regime. The Western Allies encouraged West Germany to enhance its links to West Berlin, but they made clear that in their opinion, West Berlin was not a part of the Federal Republic of Germany. Things changed in 1989/1990, when the so called 2+4 treaty was negotiated. It was signed by the two governments of Germany and by the four Allies, and it gave Germany back its full souvereignity. ",

After the war, the western allies and the USSR had divided Germany into four occupation zones. When the cold war came, The red area became the GDR, better known as East Germany. The orange, blue and green areas became west Germany. The capital of Berlin was the de jure capital of both, but the de facto capital of the GDR. So, west Berlin became part of West Germany, and east Berlin became part of East Germany. ",
