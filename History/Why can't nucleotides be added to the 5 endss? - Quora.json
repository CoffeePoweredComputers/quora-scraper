            "answer_text": "DNA pol uses the energy provided by hydrolysis of the high-energy phosphate bond at the 5' end of the incoming nucleotide to add it to the 3' end of the growing DNA. For example, if two ATPs joined to form the di-nucleotide AA, energy from one triphosphate is used and the 5' end would retain the other high-energy triphosphate. A third nucleotide (e.g., GTP) can be added at the 5' end using energy from hydrolysis of the high-energy phosphate bond at the 5' end of the dinucleotide. The newly formed trinucleotide GAA would retain the triphophate the the 5' end for addition of the 4th nucleotide, and so forth. Every enzymes have some kind of species they bind to in a pocket of their target protein. Although, some degree of specificity is attached to their activity. DNA Polymerase is highly specific for 3'-OH terminal of the growing strand. This is because the deoxyribonycleotides been added by these enzyme have phosphate groups which must react with 3'-OH group to form a phophodiester bond giving rise to a pyrophosphate group which is been hydrolyzed by phosphodiesterase enzyme to generate the Gibbs free energy responsible for ATP synthesis that makes the reaction spontaneous. Now, looking at the other end. Assuming DNA polymerase acts from the the 5' end, it means we will have two different phosphate group which will react together. One phosphate from the deoxyribonucleotide (gama-phosphate) and the other from the 5'-end of the lagging strand. This will not promote a spontaneous activity of DNA polymerase. DNA polymerase can't start working without 3'OH extremity and template to copy. I think evolution did not produce a DNA polymerase that adds DNA at the 5' end of DNA because such a DNA cannot be proofread and then continue to be replicated. If an error occurred, proofreading would remove the newly incorporated nucleotide at the 5' end along with the high-energy phosphate bond. Without the high-energy phosphate bond, the correct nucleotide can not be added. Without proofreading, life wouldn't be good. HOPE THIS HELPS. ",

            "answer_text": "Nucleotides cannot be added to the phosphate (5\u2032) end because DNA polymerase can only add DNA nucleotides in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction. The lagging strand is therefore synthesised in fragments the fragments are then sealed together by an enzyme called ligas. ",
