            "answer_text": "The world doesn\u2019t care about armenia nor azerbaijan. The biggest stick armenia has is to pull the religious sympathy (christians vs muslims) and the CSTO. But from an economic point of view armenia is barely integrated with anybody. Azerbaijan is integrated with Turkey and has ethnic links so that means at least regionally they have more friends. Iran has a huge ethnic azeri population it cannot afford to upset. Georgia is the only one that could come down pro-armenia but they are unfriendly with Russia and Armenia is a reliable russian ally. If I would be Armenia I would try to get Georgia on my side. Nobody else cares though unless the azeris start a genocide and even then there is no guarantee the world would step in militarily ",

            "answer_text": "Many weapon producers can test their products in real combat situations. Apart from that, my impression is that the huge majority of the world is not really impressed or interested. The situation is complicated because these territories are internationally accepted territories of Azerbaijan. Thus, Armenians currently can not await very active support from anybody. They missed the opportunity in the last 30 years to clarify the situation via diplomacy, and now they are practically alone. ",
