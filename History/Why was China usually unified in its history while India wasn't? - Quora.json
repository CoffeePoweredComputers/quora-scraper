            "answer_text": "I am not an expert in India, however food for thought. What divides countries is harder to discern than just looking at a map. Africa has deserts, and disease zones that divide it east to west. The Tetsi fly slowed the migration of animals and people north to south. In China, the disease ridden south took a long time to colonize until people built up enough tolerance for settlers to overcome the malarial swamps. In South America the mountains and jungles prevented a unification along the lines of the United States. Simon Bolivar wanted to make a Estados Unidos Amercianos Sud after the Spanish Viceroyships became independent. Just as the Viceroyship boundaries were predicated on geographical barriers, so did the oligarchs found the various independent countries we see there today. So, in India, not only do you have the various geographical boundaries, but you have the religious divisions (Hindu vs Muslim vs Sikh) brought about by invasion or conversion. Throw in the various competing principalities that arose from historical areas of tribal influence. Then you need to appreciate that NO monarch ever had complete control over any country. In the days when news took weeks or months to get from point A to point B, when armies took weeks or months to assemble. When communication might be subject to interpretation through multiple parties, it was impossible for a monarch to enforce his or her will on a nation. Control was done by an intricate network of pledges of loyalties and quid pro quo. A kind appointed representatives to rule, control and tax in his name. In exchange his representative was granted a title and hereditary ownership of lands that he could pass down to his heirs. In exchange he pledged fealty to pay taxes and to give aid in the form of men at war when his Lord called. Through out history we see war after war when these barons, princes or earls chose to change allegiance in exchange for a better deal from someone else who felt they had a better claim to the throne than the current heir sitting the throne. Tribal loyalties and affiliations were no different in India, and the geography played a part in the divisions. It is hard to enforce your will on a territory that you cannot reach easily or without excess cost. Winning lands and holding them, is only worthwhile if those lands return value in excess of their cost in winning and holding. Wars are not free or even cheap. That is why the most frequently fought over lands in world history are those that are the most fertile or the richest in mineral wealth. Lets look at Egypt for instance. Egypt has been fought over for time immemorial. It was rich in grain growing areas due to the annual flooding of the Nile. The Greeks took it, then the Romans all for the grain. Today it is not valued by much, since it is poor in mineral wealth and greater grain growing areas has superseded it. Instead, desert areas incapable of supporting much in the way of agriculture are now more highly valued due to the mineral riches of Petroleum. So, applying that to India, you can see which areas might be more highly prized for conquest. Area such as the Spice Coast, or rich agricultural areas. If you look at the topographic areas in India below in the first map, and then compare them with\u2026.  Teh Physiographic regions in the map below you can start to see the geographic barriers that formed the divisions between\u2026  The tribal groups shown in the map below. Notice the relative percentages of population in the various tribal regions. This can be traced directly to the fertility of the lands. This also relates to the desirability of having and holding the land.  Rivers and plains = agricultural productivity which = cities and commerce. Mountains, deserts and high plateaus = less sparsely settled and less desirous unless mineral wealth is present. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, there are 9 empires that ruled about half or more of present day India. These are Nandas, Mauryas, Guptas, Vardhana [Harsha] empire, Palas, Sultanates, Mughals, Marathas and the British. This is comparable to the number of empires of China who ruled about half or more of present day China. There were also others like Cholas, Satvahanas and Rashtrakutas who ruled significant parts and were quite impactful with their art work. I have taken these charts from John Keay\u2019s India   Evolution of India While the premise of the question has been invalidated, there is a broader point. What unified means? Chinese history places a lot of emphasis on the political union. Kings were like gods and due to frequent interruptions, there was a need to keep a strongly centralized system. In Indian culture, the kings and political systems were less important. Unlike in other civilizations, kings were not even kept at the top of the social order. While you would find so many ancient temples and universities and god statues, there are hardly anything of any king. You could take off a king or even a whole empire and still nothing much would change. This is one reason why India has got fewer revolutions or coups. There was hardly a centralized control that could be easily toppled and made great change. China was unified politically. India was unified socially. The primary unit of binding India was the caste system. It extended to every corner of India and it formed the legal system, social order, economical division and other ways of coordinating citizens. Sure like any system it had its own tyranny, slavery and corruption. But, it was a governing system. There are also other unifying attributes such as religion and literature. Hinduism/Buddhism/Jainism spread to every corner and the epics Ramayana/Mahabharata distinctly identified the Indian culture. The difference between India and China is similar to that of the difference between Greece and Rome. This is why Indian and Greek civilizations are compared a lot, while China is often compared with Rome. Greek civilization was hardly united politically. However, culturally there was a strong cohesion - united by language, philosophy and epics. Their competitor Romans were known for large empires and strong political controls. The same is true for China. ",
