            "answer_text": "It\u2019s much more than you know!  Meet Henry Morrison Flagler[1] the founder of Standard Oil. He built this:[2]  When he became wealthy, his wife became very ill, and they went to Florida to convalesce. It didn\u2019t work, and she passed away. They had stayed in Jacksonville, and visited Saint Augustine, and noted that the hotel available were inadequate. She passed away two years later. He built a hotel for his friends (the Ponce De Leon hotel - a mere 540 rooms), who could come and stay. His friends were rich and fashionable, and they had no way of getting to the hotel, so he built a private railway for his private trains. The rich man needed a hobby, so he built hotels (and the core of Miami and Palm Beach, along the way). You know how it goes - you build one\u2026. He was a pioneer in the use of reinforced concrete, and the hotels were fanciful creations, increasingly so. He put up his rich and influential friends at each hotel he built, and in so doing constructed the Florida East Coast Railway. The railway and the hotels eventually were extended to Key West. This is a picture of the Dixie Highway (US 1) also called the Overseas Highway. It\u2019s built on the same ground as the the Florida East Coast Railway to Key West.  Rich men need a hobby\u2026.

            "answer_text": "No, although they did often own their own railcars, which were attached to existing trains.  This is William Cornelius Van Horne. He was the general manager of the Canadian Pacific Railway during its construction and, when it was finished, became it\u2019s president. One of the \u201cperks\u201d of his job was that he had his own luxuriously laid out rail car that served as both his home and office. The problem with having a \u201cprivate engine\u201d wasn\u2019t the expense, but getting permission to use it. Rail lines were often crowded and were always owned by the company running trains on them. They charged massive amounts to competitors to use their lines, and they didn\u2019t care how big the train was - it took up space that they could use. A rail car was different - it could just be added to an existing train. Hauling a car around was a much cheaper way to travel. However, in a pinch, you could rent an engine from a railway company. Rich people could do this if they were in a particular hurry, much like you might charter a plane nowadays. ",

            "answer_text": "Colenol Henry Platt might have been the only Englishman to own a private train. His Platt Brothers textile machinery factory between Manchester and Oldham was the World\u2019s biggest engineering works in the late 19th century \u2014 much of their textile machinery was still working when it was over 50 years old. If today you visit one of the small weavers you will find in the countryside it is odds on that they are still using Platt Brothers looms built a century or more ago. Henry Platt built for himself a relatively modest home on the North Wales coast, the buildings eventually became Bryn y Nuadd hospital and latterly housed the administrative management of the North Wales NHS. Henry\u2019s private train, which he ran with the same financial structure as a gentleman\u2019s private club, was housed nearby and ran every morning between his home and his factory fifty odd miles away. Gentlemen could apply to join, just as they might for any Pall Mall London club, would have to provide references and be interviewed by the committee. None of this confounded democratic nonsense. (I used to belong to the United Motor Sports Club in Mayfair, exactly the same joining procedures). The only other private train in Britain was owned by the Duke of Atholl in Scotland, who had built the railway in Northern Scotland, and incidentally had Europe\u2019s only legal private army. ",
