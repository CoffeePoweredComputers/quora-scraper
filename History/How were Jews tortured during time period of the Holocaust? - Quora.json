            "answer_text": "Most were killed out right. As they entered into the camps, then they were stripped, and sent to the gas chambers. Others were sent off for medical experiments, especially twins. Others that were seen as strong and could \u201csupplement the work force\u201d were put into the concentration camps as slave labor. Even before they got to the camps, they were crammed into cattle cars with a slop bucket at either end, no where to sit, no privacy, no food or water. Many died on these trains. Those that survived the selection process were also stripped, given rags to ware and put into barrack buildings. In these buildings which were made from rough wood, sometimes with windows but mostly not, There were \u201cracks\u201d or shelves most were only 12\u2033 tall before the next shelf. These were used for sleeping and as many as 10 to a shelf barely 4\u2032wide. They got a daily ration of bread about 2 cm square and a cm thick. Sometimes a watery soup. The rolling \u201cSh*t bucket\u201d came by twice a day for everyones use. You had to perch on the edge and hope not to fall in. It was cold, no blankets. No heat in the barracks. Typhus, Typhoid, and other diseases ran rampant. Many died. And if you couldn't work, you were dead. I could go on. ",

            "answer_text": "You can read all about it in survivor accounts from the Holocaust. The main form was to put someone on a \u201cthree month program\u201d where his ultimate end is the gas chamber, but before that, slave labour and starvation turns him into a walking skeleton. Primo Levi\u2019s famous book Survival in Auschwitz had a chapter, the drowned and the saved. Anyone who didn\u2019t figure out a way to get extra food, a way not to have his body destroyed by the work, doesn\u2019t get typhus or the many other deadly diseases spread by the parasites they lived with, like lice, is in the category of the saved. The drowned do not last more than three months. A new injury in my most recent book was someone having holes eaten into his knees and fingers by being forced to spread an acidic fertilizer. They become infected and become gangrene. The medical experiments were also horrors. Germany disgraced itself forever. ",
