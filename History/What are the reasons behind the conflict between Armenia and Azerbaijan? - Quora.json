            "answer_text": "Before understanding the reason of conflict, we should first look at the map of the region :  This conflict is known as Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict. It is a territorial and ethnic conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding districts, which are controlled by Armenia in reality but are internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan. REASONS OF DISPUTE :- 1 ) ETHINICITY AND TERRITORY : Nagorno-Karabakh region has 95% of the population as ethnically Armenian and is controlled by them but it is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan. 2 ) RELIGIOUS PROBLEM : while Azerbaijan is Muslim majority country, whereas Armenia is Christian majority. 3 ) VESTED POLITICAL INTREST : this is self explanatory as Domestic political compulsion compels political leaders of both the nation's to raise and use the issue time and again for their own advantage. Brief History Of Conflict:- In 1920 Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region was established within Azerbaijan by the then Soviet Union.  However in 1988 the legislature of Nagorno-Karabakh region passed a passed a resolution to join Armenia despite the region's legal location within Azerbaijan\u2019s borders. In 1991 War erupted between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the region(when Nagorno-Karabakh region declared that it will not join any of the two countries), leaving roughly tens of thousands of casualties and hundreds of thousands of refugee. In 1994 Russia mediated a ceasefire which was in place since then. In 2016 there was a bloody 40 days war which resulted in heavy casualities on both sides. Apart from these 1000s of people have died in regular ceasefire violations. IMPACT OF THE CONFLICT: 1 ) ECONOMIC IMPACT :- This could also disrupt oil and gas exports from the region, since Azerbaijan, is a significant oil and gas exporter to Europe and Central Asia. This may even lead to higher oil prices globally. 2 ) INTERNATIONAL ACTORS MAY COME INTO THE PLAY :- Russia has closer ties with Armenia while Turkey and USA support Azerbaijan, and Iran has a large Azeri minority, which could escalate a crisis and entangle actors involved. Any military escalation would draw regional powers like Turkey and Russia more deeply into the conflict. 3 ) DESTABILIZES THE REGION :- military conflict between the countries and destabilize the South Caucasus region. This may cause social unrest in the region which is already suffering from the COVID-19. For its effect on India I will write it separately\u2026as questions was asked regarding the conflict only. Thankyou\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Main questions behind Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict which will never raise by frontline media are: 1.Why this Armenia vs Azerbaijan war is happening? 2.Who is responsible for this war? 3.What's the main cause of conflict? 4.What's Nagorno-Karabakh? What's the history of Nagorno-Karabakh and what's its Status and who occupied Nagorno-Karabakh? 5.Who is the real owner of Nagorno-Karabakh as per History and International platform? 6.What's the conspiracy of Russia and America? 7.Why Pakistan not recognise Armenia as a country? 8.What's the stand of India, Iran, Turkey and other countries? Main reason behind Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict will never be raised by frontline media so answers of all the above questions will come from Real History or True History. First of all the self declared country which is fighting war against Azerbaijan is not Armenia but a group of Armenian Military Force called themselves as Artsakh. Republic of Artsakh - Wikipedia Real History(of Nagorno-Karabakh) Azerbaijan historically has Muslim nativeness from 7th century where Armenia has Christianity. Azerbaijan was under Ottoman Empire till World War I (1578-1918). After the World War I, Ottoman Empire collapsed thus in 1918 Azerbaijan became the first secular democratic Muslim-majority state along with the first nation to grant women equal political rights with men. As Baku (capital of Azerbaijan) has huge resources of natural gas and petroleum so in 1920 Soviet suddenly attacked Baku massacring more than 20,000 Azerbaijani which leads to conquests of Azerbaijan. After the incorporation of Azerbaijan into Soviet Union then President Vladimir Lenin stated in his speech, \"Soviet Russia can't survive without Baku's oil\". To recapture Baku, Russia always sideline with Armenia. Before Soviets occupied Baku, there was also a war between Azerbaijan vs Armenia over Karabakh, Zangezur and Nakhchivan regions. Both the countries share the border of more than 1000 KM square. During World War II (1939-1945), 80% of oil used by Soviet was supplied by Baku. Also at that time total population of Azerbaijan was 3,000,000 but more than 600,000(100,000 were Women) Azerbaijani were in the Front Line for Soviet Russia, among them more than 200,000 Azerbaijani were martyred in the conflict. But Azeri's struggle for their native identity and separate status saw the fruitful results when Soviet collapsed in 1990. Along with other 6 state, Azerbaijanonce again became free and declared it's Independence which was affirmed by a nationwide referendum in December 1991. At the same time Armenia also became free from Soviet Russia and became the first state in the World to declare its official religion as Christianity. After Independence, Armenia started to sponsored terrorist organisation Armenian Military Forces (ethnic Armenian) now as Artsakh (same as that of Daesh=ISIS) in the Nagorno-Karabakh of Azerbaijani territory. So at the end of 1994 due to hostilities in Azerbaijan, Armenians controlled up to 14\u201316 percent of Azerbaijani territory, including Nagorno-Karabakh itself. In1994 Nagorno-Karabakh war, more than 600,000 Azerbaijani became stateless and homeless including 236,000 children. Still those people (including many Armenians and Russians) refugee in Azerbaijan. Now Azeri government displaced around 108,000 people into housing and constructing more housing for an additional 115,000 people and for the rest it has provided temporary shelter. In 2014 the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Population, Azerbaijan also created special shelter protection for children who became homeless in that war. From 1994 onwards, Artsakh group till now governs Nagorno-Karabakh unofficially issuing self declare border with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Iran; though this government or regime is neither Internationally recognised nor any country wants it to be recognised (except Armenia) officially on the basis of the history of Nagorno-Karabakh. Though Nagorno-Karabakh till now internationally recognised as a part of Azerbaijan's territory, but then also Artsakh conquest more than 10,000 Kilometre square, where Nagorno-Karabakh has an area of 4,400 Kilometre square. Nagorno-Karabakh is a small part of the whole Karabakh region. Azerbaijanis are in majority in the whole Karabakh region, just like in Zangezur and Nakhchivan. Only mountainous part of Karabakh i.e Nagorno-Karabakh is mostly populated by Armenians after fleeing the native Azeri's (as per docs of Russian empire from 1897). This Artsakh group (exact that of terrorist organisation Daesh) unofficially, undemocratically captured Azeri's Nagorno-Karabakh and its other territories. Artsakh monitoring by Armenia main aim is to abandon the native people of whole Karabakh region so that they can have complete influence in the whole Karabakh without any obstructions. So the conflict is going on between Artsakh(Terrorist) vs Azerbaijan where Artsakh is full supported and funded by Armenia thus Turkey sided with Azerbaijan. Due to all the above consequences Pakistan never recognised Armenia as a countryfor which Armenia always sidelined with India in Kashmir issue so as to create pressure on Pakistan for recognition it's status. Turkey was the first country in world to recognise Azerbaijan as a separate country and Pakistan was the second But it's astonishing that whole International media terms Daesh as terrorist organisation but not to Artsakh, may International media discriminate terrorist either on the basis of religion or region. Also, 9.Why media don't have any single word regarding Artsakh and it's status in this whole conflict?? 10.Why world is suggesting for talk, dialogues, treaty but hiding the truth, the truth of Armenia's lies, hypocrisy and terrorism funding? 11.Why the land is not given to its real owner? The best manure of any land is the foot of its real owner. 12.Why Armenia illegally occupied Azerbaijanis land in the name of Artsakh, so why shouldn't Armenia release its foothold from Nagorno-Karabakh? Its none but because of Russia both countries are fighting war against each other (same as that of Kashmir where India and Pakistan are struggling till now because of British). Before Stalin decided to leave Karabakh within Azerbaijani borders because of its historical and ethnographic reasons. There is a propaganda in media that Stalin \"GAVE the territory to Azerbaijan\" where as officially he stated, \"Nagorno-Karabakh will REMAIN within Azerbaijan.\" But suddenly his evil mind rised and conspired for which he gave the Zangezur region to Armenia, and created a Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous region, by drawing its borders in a specific way to create Armenian majority in certain part so that both countries remain busy in fighting for that piece of land thus Soviet could sell its arms to both the countries which will lead to increase its economy, also it can full fill its oil needs from Baku (same like that of Israel and Palestine where America draws the map for its economic benefits in terms of getting oils and supplying arms by destabilizing the middle east). 13.How could a country exist by giving its different parts of land in different corners of the world in the name of religion or culture? This is the main conspiracy of Europe, Russia, America and Israel for today's conflicts in the whole world.  Iran stands on conflict: Azerbaijan has maximum population of Shia. It is 2nd largest Shia populated country in the world. The supreme leader of Iran Ayatollah Khamenei stated \"Azerbaijan will get its lost land very soon, Inshaallah\". From that statement Iran cleared its stand For India, 1.Armenia=India supply arms=economically fruitful country for India 2.Azerbaijan= India's chahabar route from Russia to Iran then to Mumbai + fuel can be imported in the near future = most economically fruitful country for India 3.Turkey=trade for India=economically fruitful country for India But, in 2019 Modi visited Armenia's Nikol Pashniyan, for which in 2020 Erdogan visited Pakistan and sidelined with Pakistan in Kashmir matter Thus India should be neutral by showing that it is with everyone, by letting them to fight.
