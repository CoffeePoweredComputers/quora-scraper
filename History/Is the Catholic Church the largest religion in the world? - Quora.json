            "answer_text": "In short, yes. Longer answer: most people would distinguish between a church or body of believers versus a religion. So they would say Christianity is a religion and the Catholic Church is one iteration of it. Similarly with Shia and Sunni Islam\u2026although those divisions within Islam are far less structured than churches within Christianity. Islam simply doesn\u2019t have the well-defined hierarchy that Christianity does (strangely enough). Same with Hinduism. From a Catholic perspective, the Catholic Church IS Christianity! The Church is not a denomination like most Protestants insist on calling her. The Church is simply the Church founded by Christ. He founded the Church, not a nebulous \u2018Christianity.\u2019 Obviously, there are Christians that are separated from the Church (or \u2018not in full communion\u2019 with the Church)\u2026and many that vehemently condemn or hate the Church (irony of ironies), but since Christ breathed his Spirit onto the Apostles (and through the laying on of hands to their successors), the only true and full expression of Christianity in the world is the Church. If you take her book (the Bible) and create your own \u2018church\u2019 for yourself (whether today or 500 years ago), that doesn\u2019t mean much of anything other than you have created division and separated yourself from the one Church.

            "answer_text": "Define religion. If you mean one organization with a particular leader and set of beliefs, then the Catholic church is. Christianity has many different organizations which believe slightly different things, so Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Baptists, Anglicans, Lutherans, Evangelicals, Presbyterians, and Lutherans are all Christians, but differ in the details of their theologies and worship services. Islam has more believers than Catholicism, but it does not have a hierarchical structure in the same way the Catholic church does. ",
