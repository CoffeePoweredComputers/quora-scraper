            "answer_text": "The removal of a permanent member of the UN Security Council can be done only by amending the UN Charter. Article 23 of the UN Charter mentions the name of five permanent members (Including China) of the Security Council. This article needs to be amended. The amendment procedure of the Charter is mentioned in article 108 of the Charter. Accordingly any amendment has to be passed by two-third members of the UN General Assembly as well as all the permanent members of the Security Council. But China would not support such amendment in which her name is being removed. Hence it would not be passed. The same procedure is followed for making a new permanent member of the UN Security Council. Article 109 mentions about the review of the UN Charter but this also requires the support of the two-third members of the UN along with five permanent members. Because of the Chinese VETO, the review of the Charter is also not possible. In conclusion, legally China cannot be removed as a permanent member of the UNSC without her own consent. But otherwise the members of the global community are free to take any action against China for her illegal actions, in spite of the fact that China is a permanent member of the Security Council. ",
