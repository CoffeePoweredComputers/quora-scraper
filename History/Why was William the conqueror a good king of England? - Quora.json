            "answer_text": "He was a decent king. He ruled well enough. He wasn\u2019t an overly innovative king (the doomsday book wasn\u2019t a wholly original idea) or a great expander of territory. He did end the threat of the Vikings takeover (though that was more Harold Godwinson, whom he had killed) and Viking raids had ceased during his reign (though do keep in mind that the threat of Vikings had been decreasing for decades and there is no evidence that Williams Anglo-Saxon nobility ban had anything to do with it). The reason that he would be considered a bad king is fourfold: First during his coronation when the people cheered for him in English his guards, who did not speak the language, burned down London. Second he destroyed Anglo-Saxon culture. It is after the Norma conquest that we begin to see Anglo-Saxon names and customs disappear to be replaced by Norman ones. Third he ended the continuity of the Anglo-Saxon legal system (mainly in ending the writ system, not reissuing the protections and diminishing the rights of Woman, though he would end slavery). Finally and most damming was the harrying of the north. Where in he burned down the northern shires of England, killing an approximate (as is recorded in the Doomsday book) 60% of all the estates and 25% of the population (approximately 150,000 people) and causing many more to flee (with many to the Byzantine Empire where they would join the Varangian guard).

            "answer_text": "To the English, he was a ruthless tyrant who put down rebellions to such a degree that it concerned the Church. Castle Building is something we take for granted today and know little about. But if yuou lived back in the 10th-11th centuries, these castles were built by backbreaking slave labor and they intimidated everyone that could visually see them. To make matters worse, the Normans often built these in the middle of Anglo-Saxon towns and did so by throwing inhabitants out of their homes and burning their livestock. William undertook a twenty year campaign often referred to as the \u2018\u2019Harrying of the North\u2019\u2019 where he preemptively struck down land barons and nobility by the sword. All of this aside, not one contemporary chronicle describes William as \u2018\u2019cruel.\u2019\u2019 The first mention of that word doesn\u2019t appear until 1310 - when ironically King Edward Longshanks was burning down Welsh and Scots homes in the same manner. History books today tend to look very superficially at William\u2019s conquest as a \u2018right of succession\u2019 but it turns out to be much more complicated than that. William needn\u2019t have risked his own duchy and his own wealth to invade England. Certainly it was a rich island that would serve him well, but William had never made use of a navy before, choosing instead to use tactical, methodical siege warfare. Invading England would be changing everything he had ever known. It is for this reason that I believe William was convinced that Edward had indeed taken an oath to him and also that Harold too recognized William as the rightful king. That all changed the moment Edward died and Godwinson had himself declared a king the very following day. If nothing else, the Domesday Book, (a modern-day census, really tells us to what length Feudal organization changed and transformed England into what it would become today. ",
