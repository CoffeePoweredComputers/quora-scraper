            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question but considering all obvious factors, I\u2019m not sure it could have been fought in any other way. Sure, it was a war fought with admittedly modern weapons like bold action rifles, semi automatic pistols, machine guns, accurate and rapidly fired artillery, and huge seige artillery. the main problem for the combatant armies was the facilitation of rapid movement by large bodies of troops. In spite of weapons advances there waslittle mechanization, which is why the Schlieffen Plan failed. In writings from the 1970s, Martin van creveld, John Keegan,and Hew Strachan, and others studied the practical aspects of an invasion of France through Belgium and Luxembourg. They judged that the physical constraints of German, Belgian and French railways and the Belgian and northern French road networks made it impossible to move enough German troops far enough and fast enough for them to fight a decisive battle if the French retreated from the frontier, which is precisely what occurred. Most of the pre-1914 planning of the German General Staff was secret and the documents were destroyed when the deployment plans were superseded every April. The bombing of Potsdam in April 1945 destroyed the Prussian army archive and only incomplete records and other documents survived the bombing. Some records became available after the fall of the German democratic Republic or GDR, making an outline of German war planning possible for the first time, proving much of the post-1918 writing wrong. The french and British did the only thing they could: fight a defensive campaign in 1914 using rivers as strong points. When the German advanced sputtered, the french and British attacked all along the front pushing the Germans north to the linethat more or less held for the next 4 years. each side dug in, the Germans developed the concept of defense in depth, eventally followed by Petain and Haig but rejected by Joffre and French (replaced by Haig in 1915). Germany never adopted the tank in any serious way and the British and the French placed a few tanks among infantry, never exploiting their potential as a mass spearhead. Stalmate was the result of the limitations of mechanized movement of troops coupled with the deadliness of modern weeapons, which made massed infantry assaults almost suicidal. ",

            "answer_text": "No; Beginning on March 21st 1918 the Germans bolstered by an additional 50 divisions freed by the Russian surrender launched the Spring Offensive (Ludendorff's offensive). This saw a series of attacks along the Western Front, and marked the greatest advances by either side since 1914.  The Germans had opted for all out attack realizing that if American human and mat\u00e9riel resources could be fully deployed they would have no chance of victory.  The main attack, code-named Michael,  broke through the Allied lines, outflanked the British forces which held the front from the Somme to the English Channel and all but defeated the the British Fifth Army, and the right wing of the Third.    The Australians under General Sir John Monash GCMG, KCB, VD (then Lieutenant General) halted the German advance with the recapture of Villers-Bretonneux on April 25th after the Germans had overrun the British. This was the turning-point of the war. If the German offensive had not been reversed before they had time to resupply the French would have had no choice but to surrender. According to General Petain: \"les Allemands battront les Anglais en rase campagne, apr\u00e8s quoi ils nous battront aussi\" (\"the Germans will beat the English in open country, then they'll beat us as well\") The Australians then mounted a number of local counter-attacks revealing the suitability of the open and firm terrain south of the Somme for a large offensive, and also established and refined the methods which were to be proved successful in that offensive.  On August 8th the Australians under Monash, the Canadians under Curry, and the British 3rd launched the battle of Amiens. The battle plan devised by Monash called for the Australians to spearhead the attack by capturing the German artillery, a key objective, which minimized allied casualties, and resulted in the first decisive large scale victory of the war for the allies. After Amiens the Germans knew the War was lost. General Ludendorff: \"Der 8. August ist der schwarze Tag des deutschen Heeres in der Geschichte dieses Krieges.\u201c(\"August 8 is the black day of the German army in the history of this war\") On August 12th Monash was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on the battlefield by King George V. No British commander had been honoured this way for 200 years. The Australians then defeated the Germans at Chignes, Peronne and Hargicourt.   They crossed the Somme River on the night of 31 August, breaking the German lines during the Battle of Mont St. Quentin.  The British First and Fourth Armies, and the French First and Tenth Armies then pushed the Germans back to the Hindenburg Line.  Marshal Ferdinand Foch (the Eisenhower of WWI) then planned his \"Grand Offensive\".  This began with mopping up German resistance West of the Hindenburg line at Havrincourt and St Mihiel on September 12th and at Epehy and Canal du Nord on September 27th.  On the  26th the French and Americans launched an offensive in the Meuse-Argonne.  The Belgiums the British Second Army, and the French Sixth Army attacked near Ypres, neither of these attacks were decisive due to the tough terrain and problems with logistics. On September 29th the Australians and the British Fourth Army (and two American divisions of the Second Corps) , started the central attack against the Hindenburg line with the Battle of St. Quentin Canal.  The French First Army attacked fortifications outside St Quentin. By October 5th the Hindenburg line was smashed.  On October 8th, the Canadians, and the First and Third British Armies broke through the Hindenburg Line at the Battle of Cambrai. With this the war was all but over, although there were still high casualties with the Germans retreating, and fighting rearguard actions up until the armistice on November 11th. ",
