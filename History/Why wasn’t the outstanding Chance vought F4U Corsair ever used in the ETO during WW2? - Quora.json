In Europe there were relatively few strikes carried out by carriers on land targets but it was used to cover strikes on targets in Norway. Vought F4U Corsair - Wikipedia The Corsair flew with US Navy and Marine fighter squadrons. Initially it was used by the Marines because the Corsair had embarrassingly failed its carrier qualification trials so was limited to use from land bases. That worked fine for Marine squadrons who were normally land based anyway but not so much for Navy squadrons that operated from Carriers. Since the Navy and Marines were the operators of the Corsair, naturally it was deployed where the Navy and Marines were deployed. The real opportunity missed for deployment of the Corsair was later in Korea by the USAF. The USAF found that it\u2019s early jets were too short ranged, lacked endurance and were actually too fast for much of the ground attack work the USAF was engaged in. The solution was to bring back WWII era fighters, however, it found it did not have enough available P-47s or P-38s for the job. Instead it reactivated the F-51 as the P-51 was predesignated despite the fact that it was the weakest ground attack fighter of the three. A better (although it would have taken longer to implement) solution would have been to adopt the F4U Corsair which was still available in large numbers and was even still in production by Chance Vought.
