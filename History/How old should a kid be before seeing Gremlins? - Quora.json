            "answer_text": "I saw Gremlins when I was ten. It scared me to death.  My own 14-year-old daughter still refuses to watch it. My 11-year-old loves it. Every child is different. In the 1980s, when Gremlins was made, the special effects and puppetry were \"amazing.\" Now, not so much. My youngest daughter says this is why she can watch so many \"old scary movies.\" They're not realistic by today's kid-standards. Here are some scenes to be wary about:  The other mogwiis popping out of Gizmo's back. It's hard to watch something cute go through pain and be scared.Defeating the gremlins in the kitchen. Remember the microwave and blender?Spike attacking Billy with a knife.Running over the neighbor with the snowplow.Spike \"jumping\" out of the fountain at the end - the \"not really dead/last scare\" scene.If you have children who like \"jump-scares,\" violence and gore, who can really understand \"it's just a puppet,\" and who can already go to sleep easily, maybe watch it with them. I think most kids pretend to be braver then they are to watch someone \"cool\" or \"for big kids.\"  It was marketed as a kid's horror movie. Operative word - horror. ",

            "answer_text": "I haven't seen this movie recently.  But here are some possible suggestions about viewing Gremlins: I might suggest 12 or 13.  It seems like a movie that should have been at least PG-13 and as I recall was made in the transition to PG-13 movies.  I'm guessing that talking about it before and after wouldn't be bad advice either.If you can tell that they are getting too scared, you can take a break or talk about it.",
