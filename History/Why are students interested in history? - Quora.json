            "answer_text": "Here are my reasons:   Probably for the same reason that people love a good story. Because more often than not, that's exactly what it is.It opens the door to a number of other topics. Subjects such as economics, demographics, civics, linguistics, theology and psychology share direct links to history and one can certainly have a better understanding of them with some historic background.As mentioned already in other answers, there's always a lesson to be learnt. The phrase \"History repeats itself\" doesn't get the credit that it deserves.The realization that there was a time long before you came along. And (most probably) it'll be there long after you're gone.",
