            "answer_text": "To answer your question, first you need to look at the career of M.A.Jinnah, the Quaid-e-Azam of Pakistan. He was one of the foremost barristers of Bombay & India, and then an unflinching supporter of \u2018Hindu-Muslim\u2019 unity, the framer of the Lucknow Pact, unanimously elected Member of the Legislative Assembly from Bombay, and at one time, held both Congress and Muslim League memberships. He stood for secular, pluralist and constitutional democracy, and till 1946, implored upon the Congress to grant Muslims an equal and representative share in governance; in areas where they were in majority and in areas where they were not. He also understood that once the British departed, for Muslims as he put would mean a \u2018mere change of masters.\u2019 As early as 1929, Jinnah demanded these rights, and two points of his famous \u201914 Points\u2019 demonstrate his desire to secure a minimum guarantee of those rights: Points 4 & 5: \u201cIn the central legislative ,Muslims representative shall be not less than one -third.\u201d \u201cRepresentative of communal groups shall continue to be by means of separate electorates as at present provided it shall be open to any community,at any time to abandon its separate electorate in favour of joint electorate.\u201d He continued to support this exact philosophy throughout his political career, and never accepted anything less than the aforementioned, hence he is often described as \u2018scrupulously unbending\u2019 in his just demand. It is also a fallacy to say that he appealed only to a \u2018select\u2019 Muslim audience in undivided India. The results of the 1946 Elections show an entire absolute and complete sweep by the All India Muslim League in every nook and cranny of the Indian subcontinent. His appeal for the just demands and rights for each and every Muslim of India was complete and total:  However, there were a certain number of Muslims in India that did oppose Jinnah. The religious orthodoxy was vehemently opposed to the idea of Pakistan, as it stood little as a bastion of regimented thought, and more on the ideals of Jinnah, who as I mentioned earlier was pluralist, democratic and advocated equal and absolute guarantees for the rights of minorities: be it Muslim, Dalit, Sikh or others in India. Once Partition had taken place, it however, placed a huge burden on the Muslims who were left behind. One, their patriotism was challenged, and still continues to be challenged, two, they continue to fight for equal rights in India, and three, they have to coexist in India as a minority - which even at 13% or 200 million is an extremely small figure compared to the overarching presence of 800 million Hindus in India today. Also, nowhere in India do Muslims form a congruous majority - out of the 29 States of India, taking away Kashmir - which is disputed, there is not a single Muslim majority State, or a State with sufficient Muslim majority ruled by a Muslim Chief Minister. In India today, Mr. Modi and the BJP have swept into power with an absolute majority - however Muslim representation in India is at its lowest since 1957, and the BJP won power without having a single Muslim MP from its party. This goes to show that Hindu India need not require the Muslim vote to have its say - which is dangerous for the millions of Muslims who today are voiceless in Central and State Legislature. What is even more surprising is that the State of Uttar Pardesh, which has sizable Muslim majority, has not even a single Muslim MP from that province to fight for the rights of Muslims. It is little wonder then, that parties such as the AIMIM of the Owaisi brothers, Asaduddin and Akbaruddin, are finding more and more appeal and prominence, due to their political stand of fighting for Muslims rights by Muslim political parties, and their insistence to the voter to shy-away from \u2018secular\u2019 parties such as Congress, who in their own words, \u2018use the Muslim vote\u2019 to win and then do little or nothing to further the political, social and economic development of Indian Muslims. As it stands, according to the Sachar Committee and Ranganath Commission, constituted by the Federal Government of India, Indian Muslims are deprived and marginalized, and their condition is worst than the Dalits, and OBCs in India. They are the highest jailed ethnic group in India, their share in Government jobs is the lowest of all ethnic groups, and the same can be said about their education, and economic standing in India. Even their staple diet of meat, is under a \u2018beef ban\u2019 imposed in 22 out of 29 Indian States. Now in this environment it is irrational to think any Indian Muslim would like to survive in India can openly support Jinnah\u2019s ideology. Jinnah for Indian Muslims may be the harbinger of a severe Hindu backlash, and the patriotic nationalist Indian Muslim would rather abstain from supporting Jinnah, as he or she continues to fight an uphill battle to supplant himself in a society that requires him or her to showcase patriotism to survive. Muslims in India may also think that it is the legacy of Jinnah and the scars of Partition that have left the Muslims hapless and their position in India severely jeopardized as time and again, the Indian Muslim needs to \u2018prove his loyalty\u2019 as they will always be looked upon as par of \u2018that community\u2019 that vivisected India; although that may not be the case. Also, the Indian Muslim is a proud Indian. He or she also believes that it is their birthright to exist in India, as a citizen of that country and enjoy all the privileges that India represents to that community, and this community is resilient and confident it can manage to win its place and overcome odds, and exist in the multicultural and multi-ethnic society that is India. Jinnah stood for the rights of Muslims, and in Pakistan he achieved his goal. Today we as Pakistanis thank him for this great gift of freedom; freedom from any majority, British, Hindu, or otherwise, dominating us. Our freedom is sacrosanct to us. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know what other indian muslims think, but for me, Jinnah is and will remain a complete failure even by his own standards. He always claimed to be the leader of those of us who were in muslim minority provinces, and what a ride he took our grandfathers for! For someone who claimed to be \u2018the sole spokesperson\u2019 for indian muslims, what did he leave us with? Any man with a sense of honour would have agreed to an honourable settlement with the British and the Congress, but not the Quaid. He would have his Pakistan, no matter at what cost. But his real legacy is not Pakistan, but the thousands of muslim ghettos all over India. It\u2019s entirely because of him that muslims in independent India have lost all political and cultural bargaining power, altogether ignored or reduced to mere vote-banks. He is like the shepherd who abandoned his flock to the wolves and ran away. ",
