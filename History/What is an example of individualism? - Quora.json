            "answer_text": "You and your neighbors all keep good care of your home and lawn, you all dress well, you all go to work around the same time, you all eat similar foods, you all listen to similar music, and you all drive similar cars. A foreigner buys the house across from you one day, however. He dresses differently from you, he speaks a different language than you, he grills strange cuisines that you sometimes get a wiff of, he throws parties with friends that play strange music to you. Furthermore, he\u2019s bad about keeping up with his lawn\u2014 his grass grows tall\u2014 and his lawn is adorned with statues of gods that you do not believe in. His car is also a piece of junk according to your standards. Furthermore, though you all have invited him to your community potlucks, he has never shown up to bring you all any foods or beverages. Your neighbors decide one day at a community meeting that it is time to say something to your new neighbor\u2014 he can\u2019t be allowed to diverge from the ways of the neighborhood to the extent that he is, because keeping up a certain kind of appearance, and creating a certain kind of environment is important for the neighborhood. Furthermore, he hasn\u2019t \u201cpaid enough tribute\u201d so-to-speak, since he has not donated food or money to your gatherings. One man, let\u2019s call him Benjamin, stands out during this meeting, however, and exclaims \u201cwhat the heck are you all talking about? We can\u2019t tell this man what to do with his home\u2014 it\u2019s his! He owes the neighborhood nothing other than to let us all live as we please too, and he isn\u2019t hurting anybody! Who are we to tell him how to live his life and what to do with his home or body? Why do we have a right to do that when we wouldn't respect his right to do the same to us? Does it really matter that there are more of us than him? How would you like it if you were new to a neighborhood and all your neighbors picked on you for being different and demanded that you bend to their will or leave? Besides, isn\u2019t diversity in ways of life good? Maybe we can learn something from our new neighbor that will be of great value to us.\u201d Benjamin is the individualist of our story\u2014 he believes that \u201cthe community\u201d or any centralized organization fails to have the authority to make individuals bend their wills to that of said community or organization. People, according to Benjamin, should be free to live their lives as they please so long as they respect the equal rights of others to do the same. Beyond that, the community (or in this case the neighborhood) can make no demands of any of its members. ",
