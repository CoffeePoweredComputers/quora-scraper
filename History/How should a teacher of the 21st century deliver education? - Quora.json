            "answer_text": "Much has been written about the skills that students will need in the 21st century and this discussion might shape how teachers deliver education. The new skills that are particularly required in the 21st Century and not for time in memorial are: 1-multi-disciplinary approach 2-lifelong learning 3-learning faster These skills are all required by the doubling of information every 18 months (according to McKinsey). In six years information increases 16 fold. What these skills have in common is a focus on learning skills rather than knowledge acquisition. Therefore the teacher focus would be on making students knowledgeable about learning to learn. A focus on learning to learn would lead to a focus on mental frameworks, thinking processes such as design thinking and courses in how to select and authenticate information and read more efficiently.
