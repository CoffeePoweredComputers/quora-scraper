            "answer_text": "Have a listen to the podcast series Hardcore History by Dan Carlin. It's awesome and one of my favourite podcasts. Even better is that it makes Dan and his team enough money that they can make a living from it.  Dan picks a topic in history he finds interesting and tells us about it. For a historian fanatic it must a huge amount of fun to make. He gets to pick his own topics, read and research them as much as he wants and then tell thousands of people his interpretation of it.  Here is the blurb: In \"Hardcore History\" the very unconventional Dan Carlin takes his \"Martian\", outside-the-box way of thinking and applies it to the past. Was Alexander the Great as bad a person as Adolf Hitler? What would Apaches with modern weapons be like? Will our modern civilization ever fall like civilizations from past eras?  You could try and create something similar?  A new hardcore histories episode is released every 4 or 5 months! That's ages and means that you could release a similar style podcast without having to compete. I know I would download and listen to plenty more well produced history podcasts. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Most history majors are talented writers. You can tutor, do SEO optimization, copy writing... Now if you want to live off purely history related writing then it becomes difficult. But here are some options. 1. Write kindle books about specific history subjects. It's hard to make a living with only kindle but if you are good, people will demand your books and you should see your income grow. 2. Work as a historian. Most schools and large organization/ corporations have historian positions. It's not a huge wage but you can make a living. 3. Work for wealthy families. Many wealthy families want to emphasize heritage. If you can show you can build their ancestry and build their family history then you can make some mney. Good luck!  ",
