            "answer_text": "Define border states. The border between Union and Confederacy, of course, is a definition after the fact. At the time of the secession crisis, it was generally recognized that there was a lower South (sometimes called \u201cthe Gulf Squadron\u201d, although it included Georgia and South Carolina) and the upper South. The upper South tended to have larger areas where plantation slavery did not take root due to various reasons (usually lack of good soil or transport). Also, the settlers of the upper South tended to be less culturally enthralled to slavery as an institution than the lower South, where it was a way of life. When the secession crisis came, the lower South seceded almost as a bloc, with South Carolina leading the way. There are strong suggestions that vote-rigging was involved in Georgia (and to a much lesser extent in Texas), but generally there was no organized resistance to secession. Not so in the other slave states, though it sometimes was a close thing; Arkansas\u2019s initial secession vote failed by only six votes, and North Carolina\u2019s by only a single vote- 51 to 50 against secession. Not that this was any victory for unionism, though Lincoln and the Republicans made the foolish mistake of thinking this was so. The vast majority of those voting against secession did so conditionally- and some of them in Arkansas and Virginia sent their conditions to Washington. Those demands, in so many words, were that Abraham Lincoln resign, that a constitutional amendment mandating slavery be legal throughout the United States, and the outlawing of advocacy of abolition- in short, impossible demands that admitted of no compromise. When Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion after the capitulation of Fort Sumter, those conditional unionists immediately became secessionists. In four cases the states seceded: Virginia, Arkansas and North Carolina by convention, and Tennessee by a fiat order of the governor (later ratified by plebicite). Of the states remaining, Delaware was tiny, almost isolated, and had the smallest proportion of slaves to total population of any slave state. Although Maryland\u2019s plantation elite supported slavery and made a feeble attempt to cut off reinforcement and fortification of Washington DC, its upland farmers and mechanics had more in common with the North than the South, so there was no traction for a secession ordinance or convention until far too late. Kentucky\u2019s Bluegrass and western river aristocracy were vastly outnumbered by the uplanders and the river commercial interests, and so the pro-Confederate governor found himself unable to pull the unionist legislature along with him out of the Union. And, finally, attempts by Missouri\u2019s governor and the chief of the state militia to take the state out by a coup de main failed due to quick action and the rapid must of thousands of foreign-born city dwellers to the federal colors. Finally, in the case of West Virginia, we have a region which had always looked more towards the Ohio River and the North than towards its own capital, which routinely ignored its needs. Confederate support was light on the rocky ground there, and as soon as Union troops moved in the local politicians organized a loyalist Virginia legislature which pretty much existed for one reason alone: to rubber-stamp permission for West Virginia to secede and rejoin the Union as a separate state. In all these cases, we are talking about states which had, to a greater or lesser extent, a mixture of cultures- highland/mountain farms v. plantation elite v. immigrants v. industry and trade. In the deep South, the plantation culture was almost monoculture, with near total control throughout the state (at first). It was that plantation culture- that which most depended upon slavery and the social structure that defended it- which drove secession. The less prevalent that plantation culture was, the less support secession had in the state. And in places where other cultures stood equal with plantation culture, secession lost. ",

            "answer_text": "That answer varies from state to state. I can tell you why Kentucky didn\u2019t secede. The first and most important reason is that there were more Unionists in Kentucky and they didn\u2019t want to. They wanted to make their allegiance to the Union clear, and they did. Kentucky put up 100,000 soldiers for the Union, as compared to 20,000 for the CSA. Our perception of Kentucky as pro-CSA is mostly based on things that happened during Reconstruction and the Lost Cause fad, where the state, in a move that was ever so Kentucky, joined the side that already lost. Not the losing side; the side that already lost. I repeat; when the War was on, there was nobody more true blue than a Kentuckian, and you were in danger of a punch in the mouth if you said different. It was AFTER the war that the sympathies of the Kentuckian slid to the CSA. Another reason why Kentucky didn\u2019t secede is that people were painfully aware that their state was going to be a battleground. And it was. The famous Hanson family, who lost three sons fighting on one side of the war and two on the other, lived four blocks from my childhood home. The town I grew up in saw a small battle. The town I had my first apartment in had a large battle. I\u2019m standing on land that Cassius Clay used to own as I write this, and Jefferson Davis went to college a block south of my house. Abraham Lincoln saw slaves whipped a block south of that. The modern Presbyterian church was founded two blocks south of that, a block from where John C. Breckenridge, who ran against Lincoln in 1860 and served as the Vice President of the CSA, had his campaign headquarters. I\u2019m pretty sure I can see the building where Bickley and Pike founded the KGC from my back roof. Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin because of a visit to Kentucky. The Marget Garner case occurred because a slave from Covington tried to sneak into Cincinnati. The lawyer in the Garner case was lynched because he tried to take a ferry from Cincinnati to Covington. The slaves were being used as industrial workers in Central Kentucky, making endless coils of Kentucky hemp rope for the entire world. What we know about the disastrous culmination of slavery and industrialization was learned here. Kentucky was the front line in the slavery debate, and they knew it. There was little doubt, in the minds of anyone in Kentucky, that any open war would turn into desperate violence between their neighbors and around their homes. Those people trying to fool themselves that secession could be accomplished without blood, they didn\u2019t live around here. The people trying most desperately to compromise, like Crittenden and Breckenridge, were from here. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that the eastern part of the state was completely filled with escaped slaves and \u201crenegade Indians\u201d and other people who didn\u2019t want to be bothered with American society of the 19th century and went waaaaaaaaay back in the hills. Those folks were most enthusiastically not in favor of secession. In fact, the only time that the CSA got it together to declare any sort of secession convention in Kentucky (they ran from the border state convention in Louisville with their tails between their legs), all they could find were 200 people and they had to have their \u201cconvention\u201d in the Paducah area, three hundred miles from Eastern Kentucky. There was no love for Slave Power in those hills, and they showed it. The people of Eastern Kentucky have always had an astonishing capacity for violence when confronted in their homes, and Confederate troops that tried to maneuver through the cliffs and crannies of Eastern Kentucky often found themselves disappearing. Kentucky had a pro-Union state government, the President was from Kentucky and painfully aware of the necessity of keeping it in the Union, and there were Union troops operating on Kentucky soil at all times. The proclamation banning both armies from Kentucky was never serious and was quickly replaced by a proclamation banning only the CSA. The Governor was never pro-CSA, but he was suspected of being insufficiently anti-CSA so every bill that he sent to the legislature was voted against, everything he was against was voted for so then he was forced to veto, and then he found his veto overridden so often that the man actually resigned from the governor\u2019s seat out of frustration. With soil this bitter, what seeds could take root? The CSA erred terribly from the very beginning. Georgia Senator Howell Cobb was reported as saying \u201cthe border states would have to do all the fighting,\u201d while the rest of the South \u201cundisturbed might go about its business raising slaves and cotton.\u201d Well, there\u2019s some question about whether he really said it or not. The Louisville Journal said he said it, he said he didn\u2019t, but nonetheless, it was true and people didn\u2019t like to read it. One of the very first things the CSA did was prevent the northern trade of southern cotton. The people who lived along the Ohio River, they didn\u2019t like that. Then some CSA soldiers in Nashville commandeered the locomotives of the Louisville and Nashville line, and the people of Louisville didn\u2019t like that either. After that, it was over. To sum up; the people didn\u2019t want it, didn\u2019t want to pay for it, and couldn\u2019t\u2019ve if they\u2019d wanted to. There was never any serious chance of Kentucky joining the CSA, Like so many other things about the CSA, it was so completely stupid and doomed to even try it that one wonders what the heck they were thinking. After the war, Kentucky ended up putting its sympathies with the South. The state was apparently quite enthusiastic about the Lost Cause (at least in the monied sections and not in the east, where there was open warfare between mine owners and American communists). And it was certainly enthusiastic about open racism and economic oppression. And then they REALLY messed up with the KKK. As history\u2019s opinion of the CSA slid from \u201cnoble attempt at self-governance\u201d to \u201cdespicable attempt to deny humans self-governance,\u201d Kentucky ended up getting lumped in with that. So Kentucky was with the Union during the war and sided with the South after they lost. It was a little bit noble, a tiny bit mean, and maybe even a smidge of stupid; Kentucky! ",
