            "answer_text": "In answer to the forever-asked question \u201cWhy do people die and kill for their beliefs ?\u201d\u2026.Once a person firmly believes that a \u201cGod\u201d wants (or permits) the killing of someone who does NOT believe in the same \u201cGod\u201d (or religious beliefs), there is nothing that will dissuade that person from that hope or intention. The person FEARS displeasing or disobeying that \u201cGod\u201d. Modern psychology informs us that these beliefs all originate from religious concepts being learned from childhood and continually visualized by the brain, including \u201csupernatural beings\u201d (gods, ghosts, ghouls, souls, devils, angels, faeries, demons, etc), all claimed by believers as REAL, but INVISIBLE to humans (of course), and \u201csupernatural events\u201d (biblical \u201cmiracles\u201d, \u201cdivine healings\u201d, earthquakes, rain floods, etc), instead of as NATURAL processes and events. What ancient religions described as \u201cdemonic possession\u201d is what modern medicine has correctly identified as mental illness, caused by brain injury, disease, genetic inheritance or malnutrition. The American systems of government, commerce and industry, for example, are all based on ancient religious \u201cGod\u201d-ordained concepts of social orders and control, including war and genocide (by religious leaders, popes and tyrants), hellish torture (ordered or permitted by military generals), slavery and servitude (by corporate Industry), generational poverty (corporate capitalism) and social inequality (racism, sexism and ageism). So in short, the answer is: a very thick mental FOG (Fear Of \u201cGod\u201d). ",

            "answer_text": "You talk of a \u201cchurch,\u201d so I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re thinking mostly in terms of Christian denominations. These were involved in warfare in the centuries immediately following the Protestant Reformation (starting on Hallowe\u2019en of 1517\u2014Trick or Treat!), which was the first time there were lots of multiple Christian denominations of any significance. There were dimensions of religious doctrine to the Wars of Religion that dragged on after that, but what brought it to fighting heat was the way politics was involved. For centuries, roughly since the crowning of Charlemage on Christmas of 800, what made a European king a legitimate ruler was that he had been anointed by the Church, in the person of a bishop. Both church and state were very concerned about heretics, but it was the state, the political powers, that were keen to burn them, because heretics threw doubt on the ruler\u2019s legitimacy. Then comes the Reformation, with each side declaring the other deep-dyed heretics and therefore declaring the kings of the opposing countries illegitimate, with no right to rule. People died and killed because their rulers told them to, and their rulers told them to because they were defending their right to hold power. ",
