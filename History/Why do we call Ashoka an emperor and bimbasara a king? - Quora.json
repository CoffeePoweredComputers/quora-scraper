            "answer_text": "Bimbisara and Bindusara are two different individuals. Ashoka\u2019s father Bindusara was considered an emperor by us like his son and his father. Probably it is just that you don't read much about Bindusara. Bimbisara was the father of Ajatashatru of an earlier dynasty of Magadha. No one considered either him or his son an emperor. King and emperor are in my opinion just a matter of word used to show grandeur like lawyer and advocate . Ashoka is known to have used terms such as Devanampiya Tissa , so he seems to have been keen on such titles not his father or grandfather. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I don\u2019t know as much about India as I would like, and I do not know about Bimbasara but I do know the definition of Emperor and King. An Empire is a group of countries/cultures ruled over by one government. Think Rome, Britain or China. An Emperor is the leader of said government, but often they don\u2019t call themselves Emperor. For example the Romans and the Chinese called themselves Emperors, but Britain did not. A King is a male, monarch of a country. This means that the line of succession passes from father to son (or father to daughter in some cases). Think of the UK or midieval Europe. As for your question, my best guess is that Ashoka conquered and excersised rule over disperate cultures. Bimbasara either did not do that, or felt that he was a King first, and an Emperor second. ",
