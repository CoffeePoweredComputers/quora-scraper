            "answer_text": "Age questions can be solved easily by looking at options. Learn proper algebraic method but apply it only if necessary. If options available for sons age like below A. 8 B.10 C.12 D.20 Just take 12 as sons age. Before 2 years 10 hence fathers age 45. But 6 years before he would be 6 and twice the square would 72 which is wrong with dads age 45\u20134=41. If you take 8 then 2 years before son was 6 and dad was 27. But 6 years before son was 2 and twice the square gives 8 but father was 27\u20134=23 If you take 10 then 2 years earlier son = 8 and dad = 36 as per question. 6 years earlier son= 4 and dad = 32. From other equation also age is 32 only 36\u20134=32. Hence this is the right answer. This is the easiest way if you good at mind calculation. You dont have to touch the pen for this. ",
