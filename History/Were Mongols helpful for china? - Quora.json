            "answer_text": "Many people credit the Yuan Dynasty for giving modern China the legitimacy over expanded territories. First, let's put an end to that: WRONG. Because if that were true, China would claim everything from the tip of Korea to Ukraine or Poland. Credit should actually go to the Qing Dynasty and their adoption of Western style sovereignty, including China's first national anthem and national flag.  Mongols and their ancestors contributed a lot to China since the beginning of time. The concept of cavalry came from contact and exchanges with the nomadic people of the steppes. Chinese cavalry archery was inspired by the Mongols. The Mongols later supplied horses too. The concept of pants came from Mongols.  The Mongol threat kept Chinese military technology development on their toes, leading to the machine gun crossbow, ballista, gunpowder arrow weapons, rocketry, cannons, and muskets. By this time (Ming Dynasty), the Mongols were soundly defeated and Chinese military tech started to taper off.  The Yuan Dynasty employed lots of Chinese as siege engineers and foot soldiers as they embarked on a quest of world conquest. Chinese merchants benefitted greatly from Pax Mongolica, having conquered and administered the entire length of the Silk Road and thus reducing the human risk (robbery, ambush, etc) greatly. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. They expanded the territory that future Chinese governments could claim. They were a cruel master, as they were in all of the Mongol empires, but China flourished. They were tolerant of all religions, intrigued by scientific advances and enthusiasticaly encouraged trade. The arts blossomed. While the dynasty was short, the Yuan dynasty enriched the culture os China.  But in all they held the Han as the lowest class, and no people wants to be governed by a foreign power. So, the Mongol were good in many ways for China, and all you can argue about is that perhaps the price was too high. ",
