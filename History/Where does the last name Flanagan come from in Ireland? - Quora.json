            "answer_text": "There were at least three separate and unrelated Irish clans named \u00d3 Flannag\u00e1in, and many people bear the name in Scotland as well. \u00d3 Flannag\u00e1ins could be found originally in Roscommon in the West, Monaghan and Fermanagh in the North, and Offaly in the East. In Scotland they were originally in Fife in East Central Scotland, in Ayrshire in the Southwest, in Perthshire right in the middle, and in Berwickshire in the extreme Southeast. Since flann means \u2018red\u2019 or \u2018ruddy\u2019, and since redheads are about 10% of the Irish population and 6% of the Scottish population, it\u2019s hardly surprising that it should be a popular source of names. My own surname Cowan is from Mac Eoghain, but there is no reason to think that I am related to all other Cowans: Eoghan, though originally a pagan name meaning \u2018born from the yew\u2019, is popular throughout the Celtic lands as Ewen, Owen, Owain (in Wales), and even John in Co. Mayo, where my people come from (probably by confusion with E\u00f3in, the Irish version of the various biblical persons named John in English). So here I am, born from the yew, ancestrally from the Plain of the Yews (Maigh Eo, Mayo), living in the New Place of the Yews (York in England was originally Eboracum in Latin, from a Common Brittonic word meaning \u2018place of yew trees\u2019). But I have never seen a living specimen of Taxus baccata in my life. ",
