The Chinese also several thousand years. And thats only the ones we know about. Magellan was the first European who made official contact on his voyage around the world - March 16 of 1521 - (but got himself killed, April 15, by meddling into internal struggles of island chiefs) ",

Our history will show that Ferdinand Magellan discovered the Philippines in 1521. But before that, traders from China and other neighboring countries have been visiting the Philippines way before Magellan mistook the country for India. ",
