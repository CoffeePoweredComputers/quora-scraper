            "answer_text": "Hannibal Barca (Lived: 247 BCE - 184 BCE) is remembered as one of the greatest military leader for his ability to incite fear and out think his opponents.  He was born in Carthage (now Tunisia) to Hamilcar Barca, the great general of the First Punic War (264-241 BCE). Punic wars were fought between the cities of Carthage in North Africa and Rome in northern Italy for supremacy of the Mediterranean region.When Hannibal\u2019s father died, he assumed command of the army at the age of 26. He had, at a young age of nine, escorted his father to Spain, where he promised him that he would never be a friend to Rome. Hannibal became the Carthaginian general during the Second Punic War.In 218 BCE, Hannibal decided to bring the fight to the Romans and invade northern Italy by crossing the mountain range of the Alps. The crossing of the Alps, according to history, was one of his significant achievements. Knowing that the journey would be difficult, Hannibal planned ahead by having scouts report to him on particular conditions.On his way, he portrayed himself as a liberator freeing the people of Spain from Roman control just to be able to win people to his side. By the time he reached the Alps, his army had increased with new recruits, 50,000 infantry and 9,000 cavalries. Hannibal also had with him about 40 war elephants which he was going to use to terrorise the Roman army and their cavalry. During their ascent of the Alps, Hannibal lost several of his troops as they had to battle not only the weather but attacks from hostile tribes who lived in the mountains. By the time they reached the other side, Hannibal\u2019s army had been reduced to about 26,000 men in total and a few elephants.Still determined to get victory, Hannibal led his men down onto the plains of Italy. As they arrived in Italy, Hannibal used the same strategy of presenting himself as a liberator to get a number of cities to side with him against Rome. His army joined these people who had now formed anti-Roman forces in northern Italy and the main assault on the Romans began.Through this, Hannibal was able to destroy many areas in the Italian countryside and he won several significant battles as well, including the Cannae, Trasimene and Trebbia. He had other strategies to keep himself from being assassinated by hired killers sent by the Romans or spies in his camp. Battle of Cannae image below: As Polybius puts it:\u201cHannibal had a set of wigs made, each of which made him look like a man of a different age. He changed these constantly, each time changing his apparel to match his appearance. Thus he was hard to recognize, not just by those who saw him briefly, but even by those who knew him well.\u201d Hannibal was eventually defeated at the Battle of Zama in 202 BCE by Scipio Africanus (236-183 BCE) and retired from service to Carthage. This brought an end to the Second Punic War. He spent the rest of his life as a statesman and then in voluntary exile at the courts of foreign kings. Battle of Zama image below: In 183 BCE, Hannibal in his 60s killed himself by drinking poison to avoid capture by the Romans.Till date, Hannibal\u2019s journey through the Alps is described as one of the greatest achievements of ancient warfare. Even though he lost several of his troops and animals, he was still determined to make the journey, showing the strength of a leader who was on course to do anything at all to defeat the enemy.Source and Further Reading: Research and Study of Roman HistoryResearch and Study of Carthaginian HistoryResearch on Hannibal BarcaAncient-history - HannibalHannibalHannibal | Biography, Battles, & Facts",

            "answer_text": "Assess the significance of Hannibal\u2019s military accomplishments Introduction Hannibal Barca, commonly known as \u2018The man who hated Rome\u2019 or the \u2018Father of Strategy\u2019 was born in Ancient Carthage in 247BC. Hannibal is regarded as one of the greatest military leaders and generals in history and is remembered for his ability to motivate his army, his aptitude as a tactician and his insightfulness into the minds of his opponents. His military accomplishments are some of the finest examples in history and are still evident in modern wars and conflicts. Background Hamilcar, Hannibal\u2019s father, is said to have taken his son at an early age to the temple of Melqart and was made to swear undying hatred of Rome (Mosig, 2018). His father\u2019s authority was perhaps the main influence in shaping his views of Rome and the reason for his life-enduring opposition to the powerful city. Hamilcar, being largely successful in the first Punic war, passed on his military knowledge and conduct to his son and when Hannibal was eligible to take command, his army described him as a \u201creincarnation of his father\u201d (Prevas, n.d.). Due to Hannibal\u2019s respected lineage, he gained reverence from his army and was thus able to motivate and sway them, becoming one the most well regarded leaders of his time and possible in all of history. When Hannibal began his campaign, Carthage was the richest city in the Mediterranean and was far ahead of the Romans in terms of military advancements. Hannibal\u2019s military tactics were evolved from his father\u2019s successful leadership in the first Punic and were also acquired through his individual experience. The defining aspect of Hannibal\u2019s career and the significance of his reign in a modern context is his employment of war elephants in defence. From their first battlefield use in India 3,000 years ago, war elephants functioned as living tanks (http://Warfarehistorynetwork.com, 2018). Hannibal potentially acquired knowledge of this seemingly advantageous scheme from other countries, with foreign travelers along the Silk Road providing insight. Battles and their significance In the many battles fought by Hannibal over his lifetime, it was evident that he was uniquely strategic in his intentions to totally destroy Rome. In the beginning of his rule, Hannibal was aware of Rome\u2019s powerful force and decided to test his command and the knowledge he was taught by Hamilcar. A major conflict for which Hannibal is notorious and his arguable military genius was recognised is the Iberian war. Iberian forces were conquered by Hannibal and his army through the cunning tactic of unpredictability and the unusual employment of elephants charging and trampling the infantry. This battle is highly significant in modern society as it effectively portrays the contextual values of the time period. The use of elephants as a powerful form of protective and offensive weaponry was greatly admired by military leaders. Prior to the battles, elephants were fed a diet of figs and alcohol. The figs provoked a skin condition in the elephants making them irritable and hostile and the alcohol encouraged them to charge into enemy ranks (YouTube, 2018). In today\u2019s society, this would be considered horrifically cruel and morally unjust, with animal rights being a prevailing cultural value. The fact that elephants were utilised by Hannibal in this battle and many others highlights the extreme evolution of societal principles, making it significant for the means of measuring, and perhaps gaining a greater understanding of, the transformation of our world both militarily and socially. In addition, the Battle of Cannae reflects the military strategies conducted by Hannibal that were renowned as effective schemes for success. The Battle of Cannae, taking place on August 2nd 216 BC, began when Hannibal, accompanied by his army attacked a small Roman force with strong expectations that it would engage the opponents in battle. Hannibal was met on the battlefield the armies, being greatly disproportional by the fact that the Romans had over 70,000 soldiers and Hannibal\u2019s army only half that with just 35,000. Hannibal, relying on both infantry and cavalry as well as the weather and his ability to motivate his men, led to Rome\u2019s defeat. The formation of his army was defining in the Battle of Cannae, Hannibal\u2019s genius configured his army for maximum success, ensuring that the slingers were at the front, doing vital damage to the opposition as the Romans were enclosed and attacked from all sides. The battle incorporated all of Hannibal\u2019s knowledge and was his finest military accomplishment. Polybius stated of Cannae, \u201cHannibal excelled as a tactician. No battle in history is a finer example is a finer example of tactics than Cannae. But he was yet greater in logistics and strategy. No captain ever marched to and fro among so many armies of troops superior to his own numbers and material as fearfully and skilled as he. No man ever held his own so long or so ably against such odds\u201d. The battle eventuated as a massacre and entire generation met their deaths. No other general in history had killed as many of the enemy in one day as Hannibal managed at Cannae. His army experienced such triumph due to Hannibal\u2019s implementation of acquired military knowledge. This victory against Cannae is an example of Hannibal\u2019s strategist nature, with unpredictability being his most frequent tactic and and one which accounted for many of his victories. Described as Hannibal\u2019s masterpiece, the Battle of Cannae is still studied by modern day generals and tactically, elements of Hannibal\u2019s strategies are still evident in recent battles. Many of Hannibal\u2019s tactics in the Battle of Cannae as well as the majority of his battles, have been expected to be adapted by modern generals, as their effectiveness in modern warfare has been recognised. This is highly significant as is suggests some sort of relation or similarity between warfare 3,000 years ago and the seemingly vastly evolved warfare of today, which poses questions about the evolution of warfare through out history and the elements that have remained. Legacy Hannibal\u2019s legacy is unquestionably profound and his accomplishments have shaped military tactics significantly since his death in 181BC. His legacy is largely attributed to his campaign in Rome. Polybius highlights his importance in the Second Punic war and the Carthaginian War effort and quotes \u201cThat all that befell the Romans and the Carthaginians, good or bad, the cause was one man and one mind- Hannibal\u201d this quote encapsulates Hannibal in a military sense, his capabilities and actions and their effect on his army and people who came into contact with him. In his legacy, he left methods, strategies and tactics which lent themselves to his victories in the ancient world and also were passed through ages of military and many of Hannibal\u2019s tactics are now established in modern war techniques. Though Hannibal was not the first general in history to use spy craft, he incorporated the practise largely in his careful contingency planning. He taught and fixed examples for spies as well as intelligence gathering the staging of battles in many types of terrain and weather. These examples, are still studied and followed by current nations. Military academies today offer detailed classes and seminars on Hannibal\u2019s tactics (Open Culture, 2018). To suggest Hannibal produced the greatest fear Rome had towards an enemy is not improbable. Hannibal made amendments to the Carthaginian political structure and in 196BC was described as having \u201cpolitical flair that was adroit as his old battlefield tactics\u201d (Hoyos, 2018). Hannibal left behind not only great military methods, adapted throughout history, he also left behind political reforms which were greatly successful and in turn were responsible for the \u201crapid rise to prosperity.\u201d Hannibal proved himself to be the greatest military leader to ever defeat Rome. He employed his strategical genius in all areas of his career, enhancing his impact greatly. It can be drawn that Hannibal\u2019s achievements and failures are still pertinent for examination by historians and experts of the military arts, though there are no singular set of definitive rules learnt. In the words of Livy, \u201c[Hannibal was always the first choice] whenever courage and determination were needed; and there was no leader for whom the soldiers held greater affection or showed more daring. Most fearless in seeking danger; most calculating in the presence of danger, no amount of exertion could tire his body or soul; heat and cold he endured equally\u201d. ",
