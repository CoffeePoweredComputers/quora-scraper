            "answer_text": "There really is no objective way of justifying any answer, but here\u2019s my attempt. No. As someone who\u2019s been around lots of intelligent people, the only standard I see is that there is NONE. Some are really good at video games. They tend to have good reflexes, and situational awareness. Some have really good memories. Their retention rate is unreal. They tend to be good at standardized tests and academics. Some are very people smart. They know what you are going to say before you say it. They know the right things to say, and tend to be outgoing. Some are deep, abstract thinkers. These are your physicists, philosophers, and mathematicians. They excel at theory, strategy, and problem-solving. Others have good verbal skills. They learn languages well. They often are good writers, though it\u2019s not a given. From experience, the more creative ones think outside the box. They\u2019re not relegated to conventions. They always find different ways of making music, solving problems, or creating policies. Which finally brings me to my conclusion. Many intelligent folks are good at regurgitation. They are great information processors. They learn quickly, retain, and draw conclusions; but often, they are streamlined thinkers- borderline computers, if you will. They come up with nothing new. Their line of thinking is hackneyed, and is of on worn paths. Academically, these are the ones who get 4.0\u2019s easily, but are terrible at research. You\u2019d be surprised at how many they are. On the other hand, several creative people I\u2019ve met aren\u2019t that intelligent. They\u2019re good at finding new ways of expression. Hopefully a neuroscientist can explain why\u2026I\u2019m at a loss. ",

Do this: Find an attitude in mind, positive or negative about your subject - got it? React/buallo actack MMM aloud act aptually vibrating deep throat - to simultaneously move thru the chemical synapse as feeling moves to take the lead (CS rejects positive or negative charges) only to contact \u2018glials\u2019 connecting to a network of cells vibrating in tune only to generate accelerate accelerated brain processes actually solving sides of a coin caused by the under performing brain sending us ahead with charged outlooks blocked at the CS, causing virtually all mental disorders - all humans exhibit mental disorders in turn cause stress squeezed between sides of a coin - anxious to get to the desired side. Notice feelings expand to bring more considerations intermixing points of view simultaneously - & intermingled understanding replaces debate internal not to be admitted as we perform to pretend we are sure we know our knowledge. Suppression of negative to be positive splinters knowledge needed for understanding\u2026and DONE WE ARE HIGHLY INTELLIGENT. High IQ simply gets stronger signals from the brain - every thought at the instant we voice it to self or to anyone who will listen - generates the attracted point of view\u2026 so the high intelligent humans get knowledge that appears good or bad, right or wrong and not to choose only headed to cross considerations never to be solved, react/back MMM aloud - for understanding settling our soul and feeling in the lead we find a way through to where we want to go - free will arrives.

The real link between the mind & creativity comes at the knife\u2019s edge of intellect, mental illness & artistic ability. I know because I\u2019m balancing ther now. The link has been well known, but anecdotal for centuries. Scientists are researching it now. Creating is wonderful, but the constant balancing act is enormously draining. Research the lives of creative people. You can even shortcut the work & google a list of creative people with mental illness. Yes, intelligent people can be highly creative. They can also be boring statisticians & bank clerk who doodle a lot. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, I can\u2019t answer your question with absolute fact. Only a guess. In school, one of the main tests for getting into the gifted program is creativity. Generally, the ones who are the most creative are let into the gifted program. This does not say that ALL gifted people are creative, but they have a higher chance of it, if not because of their ability to think more in depth, then possibly because they tend to get bored more easily, and make something up to entertain themselves. I had a whole society made up from the time I was about 5 to when a I was 12, I literally had daily checkups where I would imagine what happened in that society. This was quite the advantage to me when taking creativity tests, simply because I had been thinking like that from a young age. I hope this was helpful, if not exactly the answer you were looking for. ",

            "answer_text": "I think creativity is a skill one can learn, and given how useful being creative is and how intelligent people tend to teach themselves useful skills, there is generally at least seems to be something of a correlation between creativity and intelligence. However it is conceivable that somebody could be highly intelligent and simply not very creative as they are not dependent on each other directly in any way I am aware of. It also depends on how you define intelligence and creativity, as there does some to be variations in perceptions of the meanings of such words. ",
