            "answer_text": "Siberia, located in the north of Asia, is a very vast land. The total area of \u200b\u200bSiberia exceeds 13 million square kilometers, which is larger than Canada. Siberia is rich in natural resources, and countries all over the world are envious of Siberia's resources. However, although the Russians occupied Siberia for hundreds of years, Siberia is still very desolate, and most areas still maintain a very primitive style. In the time of Tsarist Russia, Siberia has always been deserted and most areas are no man's land. Although the Tsarist Russian government has been committed to the development of Siberia, it has achieved little success. It did not make a big difference until the Soviet era. Many people can't help wondering why Czarist Russia has not done much in the development of Siberia? Let's talk about it below.    Tsarist Russia was originally a small country called the Principality of Moscow on the plains of Eastern Europe. It had long surrendered to the Golden Horde established by the Mongols. As Tsarist Russia has been cooperating with the Golden Horde for a long time, acting as a thug for the Mongols, its power has developed rapidly. In 1480, Ivan III, Grand Duke of Moscow, defeated the Great Horde, which was split from the Golden Horde, and gained independence since then. After the independence of Tsarist Russia, it launched a frenzied war of aggression, and Siberia was an important target for Russian expansion. Since the end of the 15th century, the Russians have continuously invaded Siberia. Due to the sparsely populated area of \u200b\u200bSiberia and other reasons, the expansion rate of the Russians in Siberia is very alarming, and the Russians advance at a speed of more than 100 square kilometers per day. By the mid-18th century, the Russians had arrived on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The Russians thus easily included more than 12 million square kilometers of land into the territory. However, although Russia occupied such a vast land, the Russian rule in Siberia was not stable, because the number of Russians in Siberia was very limited, and the main force of Russia to conquer Siberia was only a few hundred. At that time, the main motivation of the Russians to conquer Siberia came from the pursuit of fur profit. They were not interested in the land of Siberia, so except for some profiteering fur traders and the Cossacks keen on plundering, not many people went to Siberia. In fact, the Russian government did not take Siberia seriously. When the Russian czar learned of the conflict between the immigrants and the Qing government in the Far East, he knew that his country had become so vast. Of course, with the expansion and exploration of Russian territories, some people became interested in Siberia, which is sparsely populated, mainly for evading laws and taxes, and pursuing free life Cossacks, bankrupt farmers and handicraftsmen, and of course there are many others. Businessman in pursuit of profit. However, they are mainly forced to go to Siberia, not because the government is organized on a large scale, so their number has not been large. After all, most people can't stand the harsh local environment. It wasn't until the 17th century that the Russian government realized that it was impossible for the Russians to travel long distances into Siberia to firmly control Siberia, so they established many strongholds in Siberia and began to organize their migration to Siberia. However, the environment in Siberia is too bad, and it is difficult for Russian immigrants to gain a foothold there. Due to insufficient light and heat and a very cold climate in Siberia, it is not suitable for agricultural planting, so large-scale agricultural development cannot be carried out. Without food, there would be no food, and it would be impossible to sustain the long-term settlement of large-scale immigrants. The materials shipped from other places are not only expensive but also limited in quantity. These conditions make Siberia unable to meet the needs of a large number of immigrants living there. Unless they live nomadic or fishing and hunting like the indigenous people of Siberia, this relatively primitive way cannot provide enough food and daily necessities for immigrants, and the number of people that can feed is very limited. So despite the support of the Russian government, the number of Russian immigrants in Siberia is still relatively small. Due to the harsh environment in Siberia, the Russians focused on the northeastern region of China. Although the northeast region was also very cold, it was much stronger than Siberia, so they continued to infiltrate the Heilongjiang basin and seized the outer northeast from the Qing government, which enabled the Russians to gain a firm foothold in Siberia and the Far East. With the expansion of Russia and the increase in productivity, the Russians carried out large-scale development in the Heilongjiang River Basin and Central Asia, where conditions were relatively superior. Many villages and towns have been formed in some areas with better conditions in southern Siberia, but most of Siberia is still deserted and undeveloped. From the 18th to the 19th century, Tsarist Russia established a large number of farms, factories and mines in Siberia. Many poor farmers flocked to Siberia. Siberia has been developed to a certain extent, but the degree of development is still relatively limited. Of course, the Russian government does not want to develop there, mainly because the local climatic conditions are too bad, and the strength of the people is very limited. Although the Tsarist government has organized large-scale immigration many times, provided various assistance to the immigrants, and offered various preferential policies, the results were minimal. In the 19th century, Russia began the industrial revolution. Due to the increase in productivity, the Western Siberia and the Far East with better conditions were developed. The local residents finally realized food self-sufficiency, and established certain factories and mines, and had a certain industrial foundation. . But for the vast Siberia, the development area is only one part of the nine, and immigrants and factories and mining enterprises are mainly concentrated in several large and small cities and villages distributed along the transportation lines. Of course, there is no other way. Once you enter the hinterland, there is no food, no daily necessities, only frequent beasts and harsh natural environment. The immigrants will not be able to settle and survive if they leave these lines of communication and go deep into the hinterland. Insufficient labor and harsh natural conditions prevented Russia from effectively developing Siberia. In fact, in terms of productivity at the time, even if it was changed to the United States, it would not be much stronger. It was not until the Soviet era that the Soviet Union completed its industrialization and relied on its superior social system that many resources in Siberia were developed. However, due to the harsh natural environment and the high cost of production and living, the Soviets only carried out limited development of Siberia, and most of Siberia still maintains its original appearance. Due to lack of sufficient funds and labor, the Russians can only guard the treasure house of Siberia in a hurry. ",

            "answer_text": "Before answering the question, I will encourage the reader to read another of my articles on how the Russians colonized Siberia? Guillaume Fennelly's answer to How did the Russians Conquer Siberia? With a population of just 300,000 at the beginning of the 17th century, the first military expeditions and then the Russian settlers arrived, it seems surprising that the Chinese had little interest in Siberia. However, they had a common border of 4195 km long between their region of Manchuria and these northern territories. The reasons are simple: - With a population of 140 million, China at the time was busy colonizing these inland lands, not entering the vast northern territories, which offered little agricultural potential in terms of the techniques of the time. - It is only on the banks of the Amur River that the Russians encounter Chinese troops equipped with artillery, which explains why they do not go further south. The Russians were fortunate to have in front of them a very weakened Ming empire and unable to ensure its suzerainet\u00e9 over Manchuria. - The successors of the Ming, the Qings, ended the skirmishes with the Russians by signing the Treaty of Nertchinsk in 1689. It lasted 2 centuries until 1858 when the Treaty of A\u00efgun was signed. This very unequal treaty allowed the Russians to occupy the left banks of the Amur and Argun rivers and then the surrender of the Vladivostok region years later.  Today, strong anti-Chinese sentiment persists in Siberia. Russians are worried about Chinese economic incursions or forest cuts by Chinese companies are reaching new heights. They are also afraid that the Chinese will claim these areas by populating them through immigration. On the Chinese side, chinese students do learn in school that these northern regions were taken by force by the Russians which is totally false. Only the Treaty of A\u00efgun of 1858 is considered very unequal... Siberia remains well placed in the list of geopolitical conflicts to come... ",
