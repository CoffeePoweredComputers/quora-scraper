            "answer_text": " The Roman Empire left much of S-E Europe latin speaking, including today\u2019s Romania (which back then was called Dacia, one of the most colonized and militarized provinces)  However, many populations which used to be latin speaking became slavicised/magyarized as result of various migrations from the North and from Asia. Romanians avoided this fate because the migrants were trying to reach the very prosperous byzantine lands and not the poor proto-romanian inhabited ones (we see the same phenomenon today when masses of asian/african migrants pass through numerous countries, without settling there, because they\u2019re aiming to reach the rich N-W Europe), because the territory with later became romanian (and where proto-romanians lived) was extremely inhospitable (80% of the territory was dense forest, besides having really steep mountains and marshes), while the byzantine lands were quite hospitable, and because the proto-romanians were abandoned by the roman army early on and exposed to progressively worse and worse in terms of barbarians while the balkan latins mostly suffered shock exposures and didn\u2019t survive. In conclusion, romanians didn\u2019t come from anywhere, they formed as a people in the area where they now live (From an admixture of thracian speaking natives and roman colonists and soldiers). The aromanians are a slightly different story. These /Vlachs/ are, in fact, the so-called Dacians, also called Bessians. Earlier they lived in the vicinity of the Danube and Saos, a river which we now call Sava, where the Serbians live today, and /later/ withdrew to their inaccessible fortifications. (...) And these left the region: some of them were dispersed to Epirus and Macedonia, and a large number established themselves in Hellas.  \u2014Kekaumenos: Strategikon The few historical, written accounts we have suggest they migrated from the North, coincidentally around the period when the magyars stormed the area (10th century). Linguistics also support that such a split did occur about a millennia ago, exactly what the historical sources claim. ",

            "answer_text": "First I'm a Vlach (Aromanian) There are huge differences between Vlachs and Romanians. Vlachs = Aromanians Romanians =\u2026. Let me teach you some history. You'll like it. Romania is a panspermic nation, mainly Slavic and Jewish by DNA. (Though DNA is changed not only by mix, but from the place that you live in which melanin plays a key role to it too, but if a part of the ethnic group has just lighter/ darker features it doesn't necessarily mean they aren't part of it) What do I want to say: Romanians, feel proud for the antique ethnicity of the Dacians, without knowing too much about them, mislinking roots of words and endings, creating cheap theories and they also claiming peoples that have nothing to do with them with their only proof their language, and not their history ! Thracians, an actually Pelasgic originated culture which they took part in the Great Hellenic civil war, aka Trojan War with the side of the Trojans. Homer knew very well that the term Hellene in Iliad wouldn't make sense, because both of the sides were completely Hellenic, even a half Hellene half African prince named Memnon came to the Trojan aid (he might have been the nephew of Priamos) These Thracians, gave a chunk of culture to the South, Myceneans and what is known to everyone as Greece back then, they also took part in conquests politics and even in Alexander's campaign, not as foreigners, but as paid, well-fed soldiers for our almost Pan-Hellenic campaign. Pelasgians, the ancestors of the entire Hellenic ethnic group, every single nationality in Ionian and Aegean sea had Pelasgian ancestry, because the civilizations around these seas are based on the Pelasgians, Pelasgic originated peoples and Pelasgians themselves (including Eteuscans back then known as Tusci) Were known as \u201cThe Sea Peoples\u201d Ka\u0161kians though weren't part of it as many believe and Sherdn meant Sardis, the \u201c\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201dArzawan\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d capital, known as Lydia. Dacians, were a Thracian tribe which took it's name from the word \u201cD\u00e1oi\u201d in the Phrygian dialect, They were known for the fact that they beatted the Scythians and crossed Danube. When Strabo found out that the Getae (Dacians again) knew already Greeks and they were speaking a sub-dialect of the Thracian dialect he was surprised, for the obvious fact of the distance. Dacians already have had a currency named \u201c\u039a\u03a9\u03a3\u03a9\u039d\u201d and some influence from Scythians and Celts. They also called Zalmoqxis as Gebeleizis (Gebeleizis was his nickname from Aristotle). Vlachs. Now, the time has come. We,the Vlachs, call ourselves \u201cRmani\u201d which means. Citizen of Rome. The first signs of Vlach existence were early as 6th century AD, and it was about their language in the \u201cPer\u00ed Ktism\u00e1ton\u201d Byzantine book, they've served as \u201cAkrites\u201d border-guards of Byzantium and they were known to be shepherds and professional fighters of the mountains. They indeed came from the Romanian Hinterland. They were often the passage keepers and they were living in large, isolated mountainous communities and when they had the chance, they were allying with Byzantium in but when Byzantine Emperor didn't conquered the Danube to let them come safely to the empire, they showed a passage to Pechenegs to pillage Byzantine lands as a response to tge emperor's ignorance to their own people except the fact that the taxes were raised and the church was swimming in gold. They invaded Macedonia and they tried to force the populations there to speak Greek instead of Roman and they also tried to change their language too, but after that, the Byzantine Emperor managed to crush their revolution and they fled to Thessaly. Their behaviour was never submissive and they were known also as \u201cArmatoloi\u201d in Greek which is the Guerilla fighter. They often helped villages to survive by raiding the rich Muslims (rich but in expense of the Christians), and they were sharing the resources with the closest Greek billages they could find. They also helped the fight for Macedonia and they were the prior conscripted force known as \u201cMakedonomaxoi\u201d. Vlachs are the real Dacians. The Romanians were the ones who burnt Aromanian schools and started to spread propagandas to Vlachs and they eventually made very few people to believe that they aren't Greeks (Vlach League during WWII and some even today, but very very few) Like the Arvanites, the debate for if they are Greek or not enrages the Vlachs and start yell and curse and even I do. Still I want to meet a Vlach (Who knows his origins and follows the tradition) My father is more Vlach than me because my mother isn't Vlach but I do identify as a Vlach anyways. When he went to Thrace, he felt like home, I haven't been to Thrace but I always felt that We shouldn't forget this place, and most of the Greeks 99999/100000 have no idea how much History and culture this place is hiding underneath, and many Vlachs don't know that their origin wasn't Epirus and Thessaly but Thrace. But if they feel home to another part of our country, nobody will force them to be there. It's their home after all. Despite the fact that around 700 families were forced to Romania by government in 1880\u20131900!!! And when the great war happened they started to return back and same thing happen when Romania got communist but their heritage was all sold, they had nowhere to live, but the people helped them to stand on their feet again by sharing the small amounts of resources they had for their tired souls, to continue the generation. This is ethnic group consciousness, nobody has spoke for it. But Vlachs remember, and they know where they belong know. Also their legit traditional uniform included the \u201cTsarouhi\u201d and \u201cFustanella\u201d, the other ones aren't traditional or they've been changed. Also, most of the Rumano-Vlachic surnames derive from Greek ones. Don't believe me? Check yourself! We Vlachs DO belong to the Hellenic ethnic group. Why do people need to distance Vlachs from Greece and spread fake news that we tried to assimilate them and force our language or anything else that I haven't yet seen?? Greeks only did that with the Arvanite dialect so they can avoid conflict, because their dialect is 60% Albanian and Albanians were Muslims and Muslim meant back then not Greek (and that's why Greeks were actually the assimilated ones\u2026) also people with the ending -\u014fglu have Christian mainly Byzantine origin (95% of the time) because this ending was given to converted Christians. Arvanites are also Greeks, ethnic consciousness speaks much, much louder than language. Actions count more than words That's why Vlachs pulled guns about the Macedonian topic, Vlachs were the main force of army that occupied Thessaloniki and saved most of Macedonia and then again they made up the majority of the Army in the Second Balkan War. When a Rumano-Vlach minister of foreign affairs of Rumania was about to chose which side it's better to favour, he picked Greece and when the prime minister of Greece Eleutherios Venizelos asked him (in English) why did he favoured Greece instead? He responded in Greek, to protect and make my nation greater, because I'm Vlach. Also, the previous decades, Vlachs were considered hardcore Greeks, Greeks to the bone, so traditional and fanatics of Greece and the Greeks of the Greeks, and now we've reached the state of humiliating everything by making Greece and the young generations even more westernised and furthermore ignorant about the past and what did these people offered so they can have better future and life options, which they didn't obviously appreciate and demanded for more. Dear world: You know deep down that the toxicity of overdeveloped Western world is going nowhere else, but to the auto-destraction. From proud military parades to Gay prides and other humiliating stuff, from Free speech to Political Correctness, from Patriarchy to Feminism and none-reason rebells, From reality news to Al Jazeera, CNN, BBC and many other national and international Propaganda channels, from productivity and hard working males to TikTokers and other basically manlets which humiliate even more the male picture, from reality to empathy, sweetness and hugs\u2026\u2026 people, you need to grow up, man up AND FINALLY GET SERIOUS. And I'm saying this because TRADITION WILL HELP YOU TO REACH YOUR PERSONAL SPIRITUAL CULTIVATION TO YOUR BEST POTENTIAL AND THEREFORE HAPPY LIFE IS AWAITING, but you just need to feel the fire, the inspiration and will to live like you have to. Trust me, you'll meet my words if you try and feel it inside you. People tend to upvote the most politically correct answer they can see, even I do, but relatively very seldom. The politically correct answers, the ones that make the majority to dream and hope and what seems right to the people that don't know and don't want to know, and these type of answers usually don't contain this much of content making the answer very empty and just straight out their opinion, without knowledge or great interest for the topic. But. Logic, is logic. Everyone has different sense of it but yet very similar to the others, but\u2026 When Logic meets false facts and Propagandas, sometimes it becomes hostility against another nation and sometimes becomes stubborn and with the mix of interest, 3rd person's view or experiences and stories from the elder ones, can reach to the solution. I'm going to refer again to my Vlachic origins, to let you know who I'm and where I belong to. And I know the person just asked where did they come from, but I added tons of unasked info but I'm just clarifying before other MAJOR questions about this topic are made. I really won't give a crap if my post gets downvoted with 1 million views and 1 thousand downvotes but I spoke what I had to, Now the thing is simple, You just need to understand what I wanted to scream, for a long time, and whether you want to believe or not, just don't affect others with your opinion because Myself instead has also knowledge except opinion in certain parts of History and generally certain things. Opinions don't matter when the truth gets spitted, only the ones that just get affected with it and decide to swallow it even if it's hard. I don't wanna be dramatic right now but instead, inspire those ones who can accept the truth AND MOVE ON because this topic really isn't affecting you this much in your everyday life problems, but still you have to always remember these words when you have to say what you know about certain things sometimes so the truth doesn't plays hide and seek again, let them be emotional and angry.

            "answer_text": "I want to specify that this answer is not related only to the language spoken. It involves genetic results. Hence the so called Latin element is not as much present in the actual population genes. Latin is the language, but the ancestry is mostly Thraco-Geto-Dacian for all these people that now speak a Latin based language. They are similar to Bulgarians, Serbians and Hungarians as well, considering the genetic heritage. Vlach, Wallach, or Olah, is a name that foreigners and migrators gave to the ancient, local latin speaking population, when they made contact. Generally speaking, Vlachs are spread all over Balkan peninsula: Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, Croatia, etc. and of course Romania. All Latin speakers in the region are called Vlachs. They speak either Romanian, or Macedo-Romanian (Aromanian), Megleno-Romanian, or Istro-Romanian. Romanians, as the population is named today, come from Romania. How surprising for some (!?). Geto-Dacians lived in Romania for at least 5000 years and they are the most prominent genetic ancestors of today\u2019s Romanian population. Look at a genetic map of the country and see. Haplogroups I2, R1a, R1b, E1b1b, J2 and some G are all ancient genes. I2 is a split from I which came to Europe 50,000 years ago as first Homo Sapiens on the continent. E1b1b is North African as origin but present in Europe for 10,000. J2 is also very old in Europe (mostly South). R1a and R1b are Indo-Europen speakers that came to Caucasus 6500 years ago (Kurgan migration). All these ancient genes are present today in Romanian population on an over 95% proportion. And it was like that for at least 5000 years. Aromanians speak a dialect of Romanian, could be classified as a separate language, but really close, as they can understand each other better than other Romance languages. Aromanians are Macedonians (Northern Greece) who started to speak a latin language. Macedonians are a transition people from Daco-Thracians to Greeks proper, genetically speaking. Search any genetic map of the Balkans and see by the area. For more detailed explanation: DNA of the majority ethnic group in Romania and Moldova ",

            "answer_text": "Very interesting question, since these populations were spread basicaly all over Balkans, from Greece to Slovenia. My theory is a bit different - dealing with the defeat of Carpi, Dacian tribe relocated by Constantine the Great around 318 in Thracia, with other emperors after him doing the same thing. Since all the land was possessed by people living in that area, the only solution for them was to become shepherds. Since they were already exposed to Latin language, their Latinization was similar to the Dacians and they ended speaking very similar; however, due to the switch of official language from Latin to Greek, there are differences - for example, Aromanians say \u201dprota oar\u0103\u201d - first time, proto- first in the Greek language, while Romanians say \u201dprima oar\u0103\u201d, using the Latin term prima. This is a proof that Romanians did not migrate from South, or all would use these Greek expressions. With the Slavic migrations taking the lands, the proto-Romanians were not affected, since they lived in mountain areas of no real interest for the Slavic tribes. With the second Bulgarian Kingdom, they were involved in fighting against Byzantines and Latins(Crusaders); due to the ethnic affiliation of the rulers, it was natural that the Bulgarian Kingdom extend to the Northern Danubian areas populated by Romanians. When the Bulgarians took over the rule, the two populations separated, with Romanians on the Northern bank of the Danube, and the Bulgarians on the Southern. Latin and subsequent dialects derived from it kept in contact and evolved in close contact. Danube proved to be the only barrier latter on, determining the differences between the Southern dialects and Romanian language. ",

When nomad Slavs occupied Dacian lands, Vlachs/Romanians had to run into the forests and mountains. Soon Avars, Slavs and Turkic Bulgars left Northern Danubian lands including Dacia and occupied by force Balkans. It was a happy moment for Romanians who finally managed to assimilate the rest of nomad people of Dacia. But Slavs arrival became a disaster for Vlachs/Aromanians of Balkans who had to see how migrators made states on their lands. Aromanians had to run into forests and mountains because of pagan Slavs ferocity. After Slavs\u2019 Christianization, Aromanians had to attend Slavic churches and a lot of them were Slavicized. The most known case of Slavicization is in Bosnia, where Vlachs/Aromanians were the majority. Frequenting Slavic churches they got Slavic names and became bilingual, and finally they were considered Serbians or Croats or Bosnians. Aromanians are the autochtonous people of Balkans and they live or lived in all Balkan states. ",

Someone had to be there, not just everyone is a migrant. Well, to be more precise, the Daco-Thracians did belong to Indo-European migrations, about 4000 years ago. But they merged into the local, quite developed cultures. There seem to have existed some such powerful specificities, that they survived through Thracians into all Balcan cultures, no matter the language family. So the Romanians, who are the latin Thracians, did not come from nowhere, they are from where they are. ",

Bottom: After Avars pushed Slavs into Roman Empire, Roman dwellers (called Vlachs by Slavs) found refugee in mountain regions and forests, due to Slavs ferocity, forming Romance-speaking islands in Balkans. After Christianization of Slavs, Vlachs started to cooperate with Slavs. Finally Romanians emerged on both sides of Danube from Romance-speaking islands. Also Aromanians emerged South of a virtual demarcation line, passing from Varna to Nis, south of Balkan mountains. Initially both Romanians and Aromanians have spoke a Protoromanian language. After Slavic invasion, their languages developed separately. ",
