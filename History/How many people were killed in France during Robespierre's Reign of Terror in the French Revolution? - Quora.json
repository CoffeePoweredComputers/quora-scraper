            "answer_text": "The executions during the revolution were in the order of 30 000 (wikipedia report half of them during the very specific time of the terror 5 September 1793 \u2013 28 July 1794) , many other deaths came from internal conflicts, in particular in the west of France and from the defence against the foreign invaders, these deaths are of one order of magnitude higher. Robespierre became the scapegoat, everybody, including revolutionaries far more sanguinary than him, blame Robespierre for what was actually a collective effort. Robespierre\u2019s death and following scapegoating, helped in the transition to a more peaceful regime, where the \u201cenemies of the revolution\u201d had to be caught weapons in hand to be sent to the guillotine. It is interesting that just few years later, French revolutionary forces help the Irish in the 1798 rebellion against their British masters. A comparable number of Irish rebels were killed, according to BBC \u201cbetween 10,000 and 25,000 rebels (including a high proportion of non-combatants), and around 600 soldiers had been slain, and large areas of the country had been effectively laid waste\u201d and according to Wikipedia \u201cThe aftermath of almost every British victory in the rising was marked by the massacre of captured and wounded rebels with some on a large scale such as at Carlow, New Ross, Ballinamuck and Killala. The British were responsible for particularly gruesome massacres at Gibbet Rath, New Ross and Enniscorthy, burning rebels alive in the latter two.\u201d.  Some modern historians put the death toll even higher, on a total Irish population of less than 5 millions (French population was in the 28 millions), but nobody, except Irish remembers it. ",
