The Comanche do not call themselves Comanche nor do the Sioux call themselves Sioux. Look at the real names for the different Berber tribes. They don\u2019t call themselves Berbers. Ancient writings are the best sources for extinct cultures, and listening to what they call themselves for living cultures. ",

When such examples or even texts are not available to us, we have to rely on documents in other languages who inform us about those endonyms. However, those names then tend to be \u201cdistorted\u201d by the foreign language\u2019s phonology/morphology. If such documents don\u2019t exist, good luck. ",
