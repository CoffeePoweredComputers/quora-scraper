            "answer_text": "Historians use the sciences; the sciences have modes of interpretation built-in to themselves, i.e. even they involve interpretation. You need some ideology to make science work as well as it has, and mental models are employed in everything from physics to biology. Separate from that you are probably asking about how close history is to science, since science\u2019s trustworthiness is the highest we have even if it is contingent on future changes in data and its own internal models of interpretation. And the answer is that it involves more interpretation than most or perhaps all of the sciences unless its conclusions are quite limited. So for an historian to state a conclusion that someone\u2019s DNA in 5000 BC indicates some origin can be 100% as reliable as any scientific statement if it is being made base on such science. But typically historians are presenting an interpretation of events beyond the precision limitations of a given science, in which case they are indeed importing modes of interpretation and levels of interpretation that are less trustworthy because precision levels are less agreed upon. But historians still have professional standards and attempt to check each other with accepted logical analysis and attention to the shortcomings of human psychology like confirmation bias, recency bias and the like. History is a mix of art and science. Good professionals expressly state biases and missing information and neglected topics and are open to amended views. Their presentations are also various degrees of artful and clunky, as the case may be. But professionals are not \u201cmaking things up\u201d but trying to be logical and fair to the evidence. You will not know confidence levels if you are reading popular histories since all the contingencies are not going to be discussed, and historians are subject to fads or the ebbs and flows of intellectual history like other humans, hence \u201crevisionism\u201d periodically. As far as \u201ctruth content\u201d you have to evaluate every statement one-by-one for conclusions and sources and reasonableness. Much of history as we know it is intelligent guesswork since source material itself is subject to the same errors as modern humans are, but without the professional standards we now have. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s actually a very good question. Surprisingly, a lot of history is just that: interpretation. And before you object: that is actually a necessary ingredient of history. Because a greta deal of historical source material needs interpretation in order for it to be understood. The key concept is to put material (or \u2018sources\u2019) in their proper context. I will give two famous examples. First, the battle of Kadesh, which Ramesses II celebrated as a great triumph and consequantly his interpretation of the battle can be found on monuments all over Egypt. This is probably one of the most ancient examples of spin. The battle itself might be termed a stand-off. Both sides suffered losses and consequently both sides could claim it as a victory. But the aftermath of the battle shows that it wasn\u2019t Ramesses, but the opposing Hittites who were the victors. The Egyptian army had to retreat from the battlefield, leaving the Hittites master of it. And the whole purpose of the battle was to expel Hittite oinflience fro northern Syria. In this sense the battle was very much a win for the Hittites and Ramesses, expecting to reverse the result in future, refused a formal peace treaty, but would only grant a cessation of hostilities. But Ramesses was never able to change the result of thsi battle and ultimately an alliance was signed, because the Hittites were getting under pressure from the Assyrians. Second: the donatio Constantini, or Gift of Constantine, a medieval document that purported to explain papal authority by claiming that, as a result of his conversion and the founding of Constantinople, Constantine had donated the Westenr half of the Roman empire to the pope. During the Middle Ages this was considered to be a genuine document and would remain as such until uncovered as a forgery in the early Renaissance. In retrospect it\u2019s fairly obvious that it must have been a \u2018pious forgery\u2019, because we know that the Western empire was never ruled by any pope, but indeed by emperors right until the end. But the first time this document appears, in the 7th century, knowledge of the final time of the Western empire was not general knowledge, and the papacy was fairly simply able to produce a document, supposedly over four centuries old. and in itself it was not an unusual procedure to \u2018restore\u2019 documents that were actually lost. The remarkbale fact is not that it wasn\u2019t clear from the start that it was actually a forgery, but rather that it took so long to uncover it as such. So yes, interpretation is an important aspect of history, especially if the subject is from \u2018long ago\u2019 and sources are scarce. ",
