            "answer_text": "\u201cPerson of color\u201d is a derivative of the term \u201ccolored\u201d (British \u201ccoloured\u201d), which stems back to the 17th century. That term usually referred to someone with one or more black parents or grandparents, though it was more rarely extended to people with Indian, Native American, or Asian ancestors. Note that the early slave trade made contact with Africans relatively commonplace, whereas the other groups were more distanced and separated until the 18th century (with its pushes for global colonial expansion), so the focus on Africans may merely be a historical artifact. For instance, in South Africa the term is much more universal, encompassing all other races, in large part because South Africa had much greater contact with immigrants and traders from India and southeast Asia. Colored as a racial term has the same sense as used with fabrics: where white cloth is \u2018colored\u2019 by adding darkly shaded dyes. It always carries that racist overtone that white is pure and natural, and any additions are impurities. ",
