            "answer_text": "Here you go: John F. Kennedy was shot in the head at 12:30 pm, and died almost instantly. Abraham Lincoln was shot in the head around 10:30 pm at Ford\u2019s Theater on Friday, April 14, 1865. He was unconscious. At one point his body was carried across the street to a rooming house. He died at 7:22 am the following morning, having never regained consciousness. William McKinley was shot twice in the stomach at 4:07 pm on September 6, 1901. He lingered for several days, finally succumbing to his wounds and gangrene at 12:15 am on September 14, 1901, about eight days later. James Garfield was shot twice in the back at 9:30 am on July 2, 1881. His main wound were not fatal, and had the doctors simply left alone, he would have recovered and been back in office within a few weeks. Unfortunately, American medicine was in a sorry state at that time. Despite the fact that germ theory well known in Europe, and European physicians had adopted effective sterilization procedures, American doctors, through a combination of ignorance and arrogance, refused to adopt those practices and that knowledge. As a result, Garfield lingered for close to 80 days, finally dying, after spending weeks in agonizing pain, of sepsis (blood poisoning) on September 19, 1881. ",
