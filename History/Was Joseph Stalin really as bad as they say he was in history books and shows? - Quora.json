The Germans are left with nothing. They will be back, and the first place to strike is at the heart of socialism, the USSR. We already fought a coalition of 17 imperial nations, combined with Tsarists and right wingers. They blew up the transportation lines, slaughtered people, and would rather see the whole world burn than live in solidarity with others. But the people supported us, and through blood, sweat and tears we prevailed. I told Lenin he needed to show strength, otherwise they would come back for more. Imperialists see mercy as a weakness, and return to feast upon it. We aren\u2019t children anymore. These are dangerous times. We must make our own history. The reality is that there are famines every few years, and we cannot urbanize to industrialize without collectivizing. But, like children, the reaction of the peasants, and some in our own party, has been enormous. \u201cThe kulaks will never permit it, you\u2019ll have to relocate them,\u201d \u201cthey\u2019ll go on a rampage,\u201d \u201cwhat about their way of life?\u201d I hear. Don\u2019t they realize that without collectivizing and industrializing we won\u2019t be ready for a German invasion? I have read Mein Kampf. The plan is for the extermination of communists, Jews, and the enslavement of Slavs. You think Hitler is going to worry about the traditional Ukrainian kulak way of life? Even my wife is upset about it, saying \u201cthe human cost is too high.\u201d 1933 When we announced the collectivization the kulaks rose up and slaughtered half the animals we needed to farm the land. They were encouraging peasants to grow 30% less, because the order was for the requisition of 30% of their grain so people in the cities wouldn\u2019t starve. What about them? They didn\u2019t care. They were right wingers that had not a whiff of solidarity in them. They are bloodsuckers and parasites. We caught them hiding grain to sell on the black market. They cannot be trusted. I ordered all of their grain collected to be sorted and provided by ration to all people of the USSR. We have comrades with children in the cities that will starve but for these fools. We are in this together, and if not, we will die together. Some have resisted the requisitioning, violently. I ordered whoever did that to be shot, if necessary.  Soviet workers find grain hidden by kulaks 1937 My intelligence services have discovered, without a doubt, that Kirov, one of the Old Bolsheviks, was killed by Trostkyists. The word is that Trotsky is working with Germany and Japan to overthrow us. We already have some defecting to Japan. After the war with the Whites they didn\u2019t disappear. They infiltrated the government. Many were against the collectivization, wanting to keep the NEP. They waived away the reality that we had to collectivize and industrialize. Why can\u2019t they understand that this isn\u2019t optional? Men must be rational, and behave as men, not children. I feel so alone. I don\u2019t know why I am the only one that seems to understand that a steady hand is needed, an iron will, to guide us through these dark times. The workers themselves are terrified. I ordered the NKVD to look into it. The workers are demanding purges to find the traitors and stop them.  People think I don\u2019t have feelings, worries, fears. They don\u2019t know I am more terrified than anyone. I can\u2019t sleep at night, afraid I won\u2019t wake. The assassination attempts are growing more desperate. I don\u2019t even trust my food preparers anymore. It\u2019s not being paranoid if its real. That is the difference. I have to keep all of this inside, to be strong for others. If they knew the weight I carry\u2014the fate of millions of people, for socialism, my children, and the entire world. In Poland they are more right wing than Hitler. The word has been that if there is war with Poles would rather side with the fascists than us. They have always hated Russians. 1939 Hitler has big plans. We are still preparing for war. The industrialization worked, and we are working continuously, producing tanks and arms. Lend Lease is only 5% of what we need. I offered a million troops to be placed on the border to prevent Hitler from invading to France and Britain. They rejected it! The Poles refused to let us even pass through. They said they thought they could defeat Hitler because they had the best cavalry in Europe. Horses. I am not kidding. My spies tell me Hitler is developing the most cutting edge tanks, planes, and other armaments, and the Poles think we are still using cavalry forces. I can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m not ready to handle an attack from Hitler\u2019s forces yet. So I signed a non aggression pact with the Germans. The purpose was to continue preparing and delay the inevitable. I believe in socialism. I have always believed it. Capitalism is evil. And the forces hell bent on destroying us will never rest until they succeed. I ordered the factories to be moved to the East. The first things the Germans would do is bomb them. These have been the most difficult times of my life. I feel so alone many times. I have had to make the tough choices. But I know that if the USSR is defeated, the imperialists will have free reign to crush the working people. History will be my judge. Being strong means doing what is right, not what is popular.   The long arc of history will prove me right. Sincerely, \u2014Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili  It has been shown that the purges were more complicated than one might imagine. Russia had always been under great pressure from attack on all sides. Within a few years Russia had seen the Tsar overthrown, a bloody civil war sponsored by 18 imperialist nations, conspiracies within his own party as discovered earlier in an undercover sting called \u201cOperation Trust.\u201d 37 volumes of conspiracies and treachery were discovered. The intelligence services would arrest people and then torture them until they admitted they knew something, believing that something had to be happening given the threats from outside the country, particularly the Nazis and Japan. People would say anything to make the torture stop. This led to more arrests and tortures. Members of the party, the factory workers, and everyone in the society believed there were conspiracies afoot. Stalin was terrified of the revolution being toppled. He also knew that Germany planned on invading for certain by 1939 and the country was not ready. Production shortfalls led to the belief by members of the party that there was intentional sabotage. This led to the estimation that based on intelligence (faulty) that it was \u201cfor certain\u201d there were a certain number of traitors. This led to quotas. The individual members of the party at the lower levels began to increase their numbers to give the impression of loyalty so they wouldn\u2019t be blamed. The entire thing became its own system of feedback loops. As documents have not been released it is not known how many conspiracies there were, or how they could know. This is not the first time this has happened in history. During the Red Scare in America a sense of great fear and paranoia overcame the American public. Each accusation led to more, and the paroxysm of fear overcame the bourgeoisie in America. It reached critical mass, ruining the lives of many before people took a step back and stopped it. This also happened with the ramp up to the Iraq war after 911. America was terrified after the attack. It felt powerless. It was reported that Dick Cheney almost had a nervous breakdown. The response was to pressure the intelligence services to find out who caused 911 and to root out the terrorists. This led to expectations. The intelligence services began to see conspiracies where they did not exist. Anything that could remotely be seen as negative was. There became a genuine belief that Saddam Hussein had WMDs. This led to a mass hysteria in the U.S. It was rumored that Saddam was developing biological weapons that would be released to terrorists. The U.S. invaded Iraq. It would be found there were no WMDs. The U.S. also started the \u201cWar on Terror,\u201d which saw conspiracies where they did not exist. Torture began to be used to get information, but this information was unreliable. It led to false accusations which led to more arrests. Then drone attacks, indefinite detention, and black op cites. The large scale surveillance program began. Likewise, the Salem Witch Trials took on a similar tenor. Mass accusations, paranoia, murders, and more repression. Feedback loops of torture, accusations, more torture followed. But somehow they never seemed able to get to the root of the problem. Enemies were everywhere and nowhere. People were tortured with the expectation that they would say something incriminating. Protestations of innocence were regarded as lies. But then the torture led to them getting whatever they wanted to hear because torture is an unreliable way to get information as people will say anything to make the torture stop. Released documents show no disparities in Stalin\u2019s agreement to the repressions and his own personal thoughts. They confirmed he believed they were real. There was no indication that they repressions were done for cynical, self serving purposes. Stalin knew that purging the military would make the country more weak, but he feared conspiracies more. The conventional wisdom was that people were working with Trotsky, who was collaborating with Germany and Japan to overthrow the Soviet Union. After the civil war there were a number of Tsarists, fascists, and others who had indeed has some conspiracies. But the extent of this is unknown. And it wasn\u2019t just Stalin that expressed these fears. The fears went all the way down to the factory worker level. Source: The Great Fear: Stalin\u2019s Terror of the 1930s, by James Harris Alexander Finnegan's answer to What don\u2019t they tell you about Stalin?       For shits and giggles we decided to revive Joseph Stalin so he could lead a new Russian revolution and bring back Stalinism. We used reanimating technology built by cutting edge Maoist scientists, in our special lab located in Nepal. I didn\u2019t actually think reanimating him would work. Turns out Nikola Tesla had developed the technique, but the government seized his papers and kept it secret. But then someone leaked the papers on the Internet. In the meantime I took Russian language courses. My heart raced and my hands shook, as before my very eyes, this embalmed corpse, surprisingly well preserved, went from death to new life. There were a few ethical considerations, but then I thought to myself: \u201cWhat could be ethically problematic about reanimating Joseph Stalin?\u201d Amazingly, he went from cold and lifeless to warm, his color improved, and he even started breathing again. His heartbeat began to register on the heart monitor. I was utterly awestruck. Then he appeared to be waking up. \u201cHi Stalin, I can\u2019t believe we revived you!\u201d I said in my best Russian. \u201cI got a terrible headache. Terrible. I fell to the ground, unable to move. I was stuck there for hours. I called out for help, but nobody came. I couldn\u2019t get out the words. I don\u2019t remember anything past that,\u201d said Stalin. \u201cYou were poisoned by Beria. He even boasted about it two months later. He claims you were planning on attacking the U.S.\u201d \u201cWhat? Disgusting lies. The U.S. has nuclear weapons. He and Khrushchev were lying pigs. Where are they? I am going to have them arrested immediately.\u201d \u201cThey died\u201d I said. \u201cThe people must have found out and arrested them, put them on trial, and sent them before the firing squad, right?\u201d \u201cWorse. Khrushchev became the leader and gave a speech about you, claiming that you were to blame for all the supposed atrocities of the USSR. They took down your statues. They called it \u2018de-Stalinizing.\u2019\u201d \u201cWe need to tell the other members of the Politburo. Were\u2019s Molotov?\u201d \u201cCan I get you a drink? It gets worse. Come sit down over here.\u201d \u201cHow could it get worse?\u201d Stalin said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to break this to you. But the Soviet Union is gone.\u201d \u201cWhat? Where am I? You do speak with an American accent. Am I in an American hospital? Was there a war?\u201d \u201cWorse,\u201d I said. \u201cYou have been dead since 1953. They abandoned your approach to socialism. They stopped rotating members of the government leadership. A new class of elites became corrupt and incompetent. They decided to stop pulling the levers of power and decided to dissolve the USSR and plunder the public assets for themselves to become oligarchs.\u201d Stalin sat there, frozen. Silent. He didn\u2019t say anything for what felt was an eternity. He looked sick. \u201cThey didn\u2019t fight? They just gave up to steal everything? And nobody had purged them before this happened? Fools. They don\u2019t know their enemies. Without me they couldn\u2019t tell the difference between a kitten and a lion. All that comrades worked for, bled for, and died for, gone. Nothing to show for it. What about Mao?\u201d \u201cMao was disgusted by Khrushchev's actions. There ended up being a split between the two countries.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t tell me China is capitalist too.\u201d \u201cIt was close to becoming capitalist. Mao saw the rot and capitalist reactionary forces growing in the Communist Party. He introduced a Cultural Revolution. The students and peasants became engaged in politics, shamed the capitalists and other elites. Party members were sent to the countryside to learn about the lives of the peasants.\u201d \u201cWhat about the worst of them, what happened?\u201d Stalin said. \u201cMao purged people like Deng Xiaoping and they were rehabilitated. Deng ended up becoming the leader. He introduced Leninist NEP style market reforms, but the state is still socialist. It\u2019s new leader, President Xi, was a student of the Cultural Revolution who spent time in the countryside. He honors you and Mao, and encourages the reading of Marx, Lenin, and Mao.\u201d \u201cWhat happened to Mao?\u201d \u201cHe died in 1976 of natural causes. His portrait is still hanging at Tianeman Square. His body is available for observation.\u201d \u201cWhat about Lenin? Did they bury him too?\u201d \u201cNo, he\u2019s still there. They buried you secretly at night. Khrushchev ordered it.\u201d Stalin shook his head. \u201cI industrialized the Soviet Union, defeated Hitler, developed the atomic bomb for Mother Russia, and made the Soviet Union a superpower, and this is the reward I get?\u201d \u201cSo what is Russia like now? Did the U.S. conquer it? Was there a nuclear war?\u201d \u201cNo war. After the USSR was dissolved the oligarchs worked with a guy named Yeltsin, who became the first President of the Russian Federation. It became an American style capitalist system. It fell back into developing nation status. The economy has never recovered. Nor have the economies of the Eastern Bloc nations, which have their independence.\u201d \u201cOther than China, what other socialist nations exist?\u201d \u201cCuba became socialist in 1959 with a guy named Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. Korea ended in a stalemate. The communist North became North Korea. North Korea and Cuba suffered terribly under U.S. sanctions. In North Korea there was a famine that killed millions of people during the 1990\u2019s. But they held on. Cuba suffered, but it survived. Castro lived until 2016. His brother Raul is still in control. They made a few NEP style reforms, but it is going strong, despite the continued economic sanctions.\u201d \u201cWhat about Vietnam?\u201d Stalin said, shifting in his chair. \u201cDo you have any cigars?\u201d I hand him a Cuban cigar and offer him a light. \u201cVietnam and Laos are still socialist. Again, more reforms, but they are around.\u201d \u201cThen there is still hope,\u201d Stalin said. \u201cYou are going to experience some serious culture shock. It isn\u2019t 1953 anymore. It is 2019. The world has changed quite a bit.\u201d \u201cYou mean there are flying cars?\u201d said Stalin. \u201cNo, no flying cars.\u201d \u201cOK. How about some moon colonies?\u201d \u201cNo, no moon colonies. In fact we went to the moon once and never went back.\u201d \u201cThe USSR?\u201d \u201cNo, the U.S.\u201d I said. \u201cThis is getting worse by the minute,\u201d said Stalin, looking disappointed. \u201cYou get poisoned and the entire world falls apart. So what is different?\u201d \u201cWe have millions and millions of computers connected on networks, that people share photos, videos, and text instantly.\u201d \u201cHow do people have giant room sized computers in their homes?\u201d \u201cThey shrunk them. And people have mobile phones with little screens to send information.\u201d \u201cOk. I have to admit I am surprised about the lack of flying cars. If I had survived there would be flying cars.\u201d \u201cHow am I remembered now?\u201d \u201cThe older people and the non elites in Russia adore you. You are more popular than the President of the country, Putin. 60% of the former members of the Soviet Union say they miss it. And every year there is still the Victory Day Parade. You are still honored. But the bourgeois elites in the government try to distance themselves from you.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not surprising. I was a great socialist leader.\u201d \u201cTrue. But your reputation took a beating by the propagandists.\u201d \u201cWhat did they say?\u201d said Stalin. \u201cAre you sure you want to hear this?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Stalin. I dealt with unruly kulaks, Nazis, and Cossacks. I can handle it.\u201d \u201cThey claim that you were a mass murderer that reigned by an iron fist, killing millions of millions of people through forced deportations, the gulag, the Ukrainian famine, the Great Purges, and the Katyn Massacre.\u201d \u201cWhat? I was doing what was needed to save us all from Hitler, and to ensure the people in the cities didn\u2019t starve. The Ukrainian famine? I ordered relief efforts for that!\u201d \u201cI know. But they told lies about Lenin, too. And there were others that came after you that were vilified. They claim Mao killed even more than you.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to the bathroom, get a shower, and we can talk about what to do next.\u201d \u201cWe need to revive communism in Russia,\u201d Stalin said. \u201cThat will take funding. Where is the nearest bank?\u201d And just like that, we revived Joseph Stalin and commenced the revival of the Soviet Union.   ",

            "answer_text": "Stalin was a true monster. Along with Mao, he is responsible for the most hideous crimes in history. If we were to give awards he would get the gold medal for being the greatest sadistic-evil mind in European history. In fact, he is the only one who comes close to true evil. Stalin was a sadistic murderer. He was a paranoid and he hated humanity (he was probably mentally ill. He had his psychiatrist executed after he was told he suffered from paranoia). He enjoyed torturing and killing innocent people. He once said that the death of one person was a tragedy but the deaths of millions a statistic. He caused the deaths of many friends, family members, and allies (Old Bolsheviks \u2014 not that we would feel sorry for these base murderers). Stalin killed and caused unbearable suffering like if it was a game. He was the true Devil incarnate. Let\u2019s examine his \u201cachievements.\u201d It has been claimed that he helped bring Russia into the 20th century as a great nation. That he modernized the economy and made the Red Army a first rate military machine. This is incorrect. Imperial Russia had already established a sound economy with the Stoylipin Reforms and ranked 4th in the world by the start of WW I. It was actually the inept Bolshevik criminals that destroyed the Russian economy. Contrary to what some writer here has stated, he never created an economic superpower. Russia was and stayed a third rate economy up until the collapse of the Soviet Union. He did create a military superpower but even then it was no match against the USA or Nazi Germany. Stalin was ignorant of economics, finance, administration, and military matters. He was only good at spying, conspiracy, and duplicity. Stalin was the greatest gangster of the 20th century. Lenin was another criminal who was an ignoramus. Lenin knew nothing about how to run a nation. He was driven by hatred alone. His \u201ctheories\u201d were crackpot theories. I even wonder if he understood what Marx and Engels wrote. One thing he did know was how to exterminate nations and classes. He was so ignorant that he had to back peddle and introduce NEP to get the economy going. But who came in and made a total mess of everything? Stalin. Stalin introduced the collective system which failed miserably. His paranoia was so great that he ordered the killing and enslavement of millions of people. The only reason why the Soviet economy was growing in the 1930\u2019s was because it was using slave labor. Everyone knows that the biggest costs in production are labor costs. If you have no or very low labor costs you will expect to bring wonders to the economy! The Red Army was so bad that even little Poland spanked them hard in the 1920\u2019s. A lot has been written about how the Soviet Union defeated the Nazi war machine in WW II. That it was General Winter or the huge spaces or the sacrifices of the people. The only one I can admit as being true was the sacrifice of the Soviet people. I tip my hat to the brave Soviet peoples. What about Stalin? he was so inept that we can safely state he was responsible for the destruction of the Red Army in 1941\u201342. His criminal regime survived with the aid of the USA. Without high octane fuel for his air force, food to feed the starving soldiers, and Ford high suspension trucks to help them move fast in terrible terrain, the Soviets would have been defeated. The Soviet Union had lost 75% percent of its industry in 1941. It did have some industries in the Urals but they were not enough to challenge and defeat the Nazis. It badly needed USA and UK aid to get it started and running. Since the Russians did not get wages and can live on little food (they were basically slaves), they could produce thousands of tanks and artillery and munitions. Even Stalin admitted that it was the Soviet people\u2019s sacrifice that stopped the Nazis. Stalin\u2019s generals and marshals were mediocre. They defeated the Germans because they had the biggest economies of the world as allies (USA and UK). After the war the European side of Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine were completely destroyed. You would expect that Stalin would cooperate with the West and reward the people for their sacrifice and make a better life for them. But what does he do? he begins to put millions of people into gulags again and plans to repeat the Red Terror Part II. Stalin was also delusional: he claimed to be a gigantic genius about everything. But in fact he was just average in everything. One thing he was great at and that was gangsterism, murder, and sadism. He had no conscience. ",
