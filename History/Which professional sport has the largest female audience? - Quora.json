            "answer_text": "I was able to dig up this Forbes article Sports Women Watch from 2012 with numbers for the major sporting events of the year. My inclination is that these numbers are much much lower both in volume and percentage for the regular season. I will update as I find more data. Kentucky Derby: Total number of women viewers: 7.6 millionPercentage of Total: 51.3 Super Bowl XLVI (New England Patriots vs. New York Giants): Total number of women viewers: 50.4 Percentage of Total: 45.3   Fall 2011 World Series (Texas Rangers vs. St. Louis Cardinals): Total number of women viewers: 6.4 million (avg. per game) Percentage of Total: 38.4 NBA Finals (Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Miami Heat): Total number of women viewers: 6.3 million (avg. per game) Percentage of Total: 37.3 The Masters: Total number of women viewers: 3.9 million (avg. over final two days)Percentage of Total: 35.6 NCAA Men's Championship Game (Kansas vs. Kentucky): Total number of women viewers: 7.4 million Percentage of Total: 35.5 BCS National Championship Game (LSU vs. Alabama):Total number of women viewers: 8.2 million Percentage of Total: 34 I've ranked these in order of highest percentage of women viewers instead of sheer volume of women viewers. Since many will say that the Super Bowl is a social event and a lot revolves around the commercials it could have skewed the numbers but I do find football to be the most exciting sport. This list is somewhat surprising to me as I definitely think basketball is considered much more \"exciting\" to the average fan and would draw a much larger female audience. To see that a marquee event with Lebron James and Kevin Durant didn't draw a larger audience than the Rangers vs. Cardinals series is interesting. ",
