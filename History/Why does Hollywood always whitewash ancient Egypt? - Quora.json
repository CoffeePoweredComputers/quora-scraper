            "answer_text": "Because Hollywood is in the business of making movies that appeal to a specific audience.  That is, the American public. And, it's only been in the last 40 years or so that the entertainment industry as a whole has decided that African Americans are a large enough demographic, meaning it began targeting that group as a way to make more money. Before the 1960's, blacks were generally not allowed into most theaters with the general population.  However, the black public did have their own movies and, in some cases, their own theaters.  Much of the white public saw blacks as inferior, so why would they watch a movie where blacks, or browns (as in the case of Egyptians), were in a major role, either as king or queen, or as part of a larger population that was not subservient to whites.  No whites would watch it, and there would likely be protests. During the 70's, that started to change.  There were Blacksploitation films and TV shows which all featured major black characters, but when targeted at a general audience, blacks were always portrayed as poor and uneducated.  It wasn't until the Cosby Show in the 80's that it all began to change, and black characters were placed in mainstream shows and movies that were targeted at audiences as a whole. People like to see stories with others just like them.  Since white culture was the dominant one for so long (and still is to some extent), movies and TV were created to appeal to that audience.  For a long time, any attempt to change that resulted in complaints and bannings.  TV shows that featured a non subservient black were often taken off the air, particularly in the south.  Movies with strong black characters would never be profitable.  It really wasn't until 1968 when Night Of The Living Dead was made that strong, black leads capable of ordering white people around became possible.  The movie stirred a lot of controversy, but was profitable, and opened the door to more opportunities. Hollywood simply makes movies to make money.  If the majority of the population won't watch, then Hollywood will simply change to whatever is most profitable.   ",

            "answer_text": "Because Hollywood is part of the Game. The Game consists in raiding African resources and raping African history. There is a popular saying among Native Americans regarding Whites that was shared on a popular forum. The whole purpose of the Pale Face has been and will always be to breed out the original inhabitants, create a fixed mixed race (the paler, the better), claim their identiy, steal their legacy and shut out the Natives all races. This can be described as the erase and replace strategy through large scale racial whitening over several generations. It has been proven time and time again (Latin America, Cabinda, Australia etc.) No wonder, the on drop rule is applied in the reverse mode in North Africa, including Egypt. One drop of white blood de-blackens the blackest individuals and groups. No wonder North Africa has been reduced to its extreme northern coastal regions along the Mediterranean Sea. No country or continental region has been reduced to its extreme northern coastal regions. Why is it done in North Africa ? Invaders come by the sea. Invaders settle in seaside towns. Invaders build forts along the sea. Invaders get reinforcements from across the sea. There are indigenous Blacks in all North African countries. They mostly live in southern regions, rural areas and as isolated communities in the north and center. They are hardly talked about, seen on TV or portrayed in movies because there is a color line in all North African countries, including Egypt. They are conveniently forgotten when people talk about North Africans as Mediterranean Caucasians. They are an invisible, silent and discriminated community. The Tebu of Libya, the Korandje speakers of Algeria, the Drawa of Morocco are North African Blacks. They are not the only ones : the Kanuri of Libya and the Beja of Egypt are also North African Blacks. Libya is at least 35% Black. Southern Tunisia is full of indigenous black populations. The written word of ancient times is crystal clear as to what ancient Egyptians looked like. Egyptians are a colony of Ethiopians (Diodorus Siculus) Egyptians are a woolly haired people with black skin (Herodotus, Aristotle and many others) For ancient Greeks and Romans, Blacks were closely tied to the Nile. At what village along the Nile black becomes white categorically speaking ? None. At what village along the Nile Whites are found as first settlers and earliest inhabitants ? None. It defies basic common sense and basic logic to find dissimilar aboriginal populations (Whites and Nubians) living side by side on the same land, the same latitude sharing the same River and the same seasons. Nubians are some of the blackest Africans. They are depicted on ancient Egyptian frescoes. The Valley of the Kings and the Karnak Temple mega-complex are located in Upper Egypt, southern Egypt far from the Mediterranean coast and where the darkest/blackest Egyptians are found. This is no coincidence. Afro-combs were excavated in archeological sites across Egypt. This is no coincidence either. Yet again, delusional Eurocentrists will come back and say : ancient Egyptians were not black people because they were not Negroes. Only Negroes are black people. It is really strange how the one drop rule is placed and misplaced. In the USA, one drop of black blood makes the whole of a person black regardless of what she or he looks like. In North Africa, the blackest Egyptians are not black if they can identify one Eurasian ancestor. Negroes are Eurocentric creations dating back to late 16th and early 17th. There are no dictionary entries for Negro used for a category or group of people before that period. Negro is a color, black, in Iberian languages stamped on a people to dehumanize and demonize them. Iberian slavers stamped their West-Central African slaves with the Negro label and it spread to all slave trading and owning countries in Western Europe. European countries with no history of black slavery and black colonies called us by the derivatives of the word Moor. Greeks call us mavro ; in Poland, weare called Murzyn. Old Germans sometimes address us as Der Mohr. In France, we are abused as Mauricaud. I will always maintain that after the Moors were conquered and bleached (by mixing with European women), they became toys for Whites and turned into universal ridicule and Moorish legacies were confined to the taboos of European history. There is an dictionary entry in the Glossary of Archaic and Provincial Words dated 1833 : a Moor, that is a black as the negro races were formerly accounted Moors. There is a very old European saying derived from an Aesop\u2019s fable : Washing the Moor white meaning you are wasting your time. A Moor will always be black. Aesop lived in classical Greece. ",
